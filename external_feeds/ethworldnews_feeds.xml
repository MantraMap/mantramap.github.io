<ul><li>Circle has ditched all U.S. Treasury bonds from the $24 billion reserve fund that backs its USDC stablecoin.&nbsp;</li><li>The stablecoin issuer took this step to protect USDC from the impact of the ongoing debt ceiling crisis in the United States.&nbsp;</li><li>The last Treasury bond worth $3.9 billion matured earlier today, effectively removing the asset class from the reserve fund.&nbsp;</li><li>The move was in line with CEO Jeremy Allaire’s goal to drop Treasuries from USDC’s reserve by the end of May 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Circle Internet Financial, the crypto giant behind the world’s second-largest stablecoin, has ditched all U.S. Treasury bonds from the reserve fund backing its USDC stablecoin. The move was made to shield USDC from any potential damage from the ongoing concerns surrounding the United States debt ceiling.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Circle Holds Assets In Overnight Repo Agreements</strong></h2>



<p>According to Circle’s <a href="https://www.circle.com/hubfs/USDCAttestationReports/2023/2023%20USDC_Circle%20Examination%20Report%20April%202023.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">monthly attestatio</a>n released by independent accountants at Deloitte, the last Treasury bond worth nearly $4 billion matured earlier today, effectively removing all long-term Treasuries from the reserve fund. As of May 30, 2023, the <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/circle-move-usdc-avalanche-ethereum/">Circle</a> Reserve Fund, managed by Wall Street giant Blackrock, held 100% of its $24.7 billion fund in overnight U.S. Treasury Repurchase Agreements. </p>



<p>The latest move marks a significant change in the fund’s holdings as compared to April 2023 when the USDC issuer held over $30 billion in U.S. Treasury Bonds. The changes to the Reserve fund came in light of the debt ceiling crisis in the United States, which could have had a devastating impact on all government securities. Lawmakers in the U.S. are set to vote on the fate of the country’s $31.4 trillion debt ceiling later today in a desperate attempt to avert a default by the U.S. government.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The decision to eliminate U.S. Treasury bonds was in line with the goal set by Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire. Allaire told <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-money/2023/05/10/rewriting-crypto-00096124" rel="nofollow noopener">Politico</a> earlier this month that his crypto firm would ditch the asset class in favor of short-dated U.S. Treasuries in a bid to protect its USDC stablecoin from a potential U.S. debt default. </p>

<p>Binance has found itself under regulatory scrutiny again, this time at the hands of a securities regulator in Canada. The Ontario Securities Commission is probing the world’s largest crypto exchange to determine if it attempted to avoid local regulations and compliance controls while seeking approval to operate in the country.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Binance Departed Canada Two Days After Receiving Probe Order</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-31/binance-bnb-discloses-investigation-by-canada-s-ontario-securities-commission" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, Binance was served the probe order by the Ontario Securities Commission on May 10, 2023. Just two days after the investigation was opened, the crypto exchange <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-exit-canadian-market-regulations/">announced</a> that it would exit the Canadian crypto market. At the time, the crypto exchange blamed its decision to depart on Canada’s “challenging” regulatory landscape and the recently introduced guidance for stablecoins and investor limits. The exchange did not reveal that it was being probed by one of the country’s top securities regulators. </p>



<p>Binance revealed the probe by the Ontario Securities Commission in a recent filing with the Capital Markets Tribunal. The investigation order didn’t allege any breaches of Ontario securities laws on the crypto exchange’s part. The summons issued by the securities regulator required the exchange to produce documents associated with the scope of the investigation. This includes a blanket request for “all communications regarding Ontario (or Canada generally) among directors, officers, employees, contractors, agents and consultants of the exchange and its associated entities. The summons was addressed to the exchange and didn’t name any individual.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“The Investigation Order authorizes an extremely broad inquiry into whether Binance may have taken steps to circumvent Ontario securities law and compliance controls in relation to Binance.com or engaged in conduct contrary to Ontario securities law and/or the public interest without any limitation.”</p></blockquote>



<p>The probe from the Canadian securities regulator comes a month after Brazil’s Federal Public Prosecutor’s Office and the Federal Police started an investigation into Binance for allegedly offering securities to its clients by helping them evade a stop order on crypto futures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>European Union lawmakers officially signed the bloc&#8217;s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) bill meant to standardize digital asset businesses across 27 member nations.</li><li>The bill is accompanied by new anti-money laundering rules that require exchanges and crypto providers to verify users&#8217; identities.</li><li>The EU is another step closer to implementing crypto standards and rules roughly three years after the bill was introduced, making the bloc the first major jurisdiction to provide clear rules for the nascent industry.</li></ul>



<p>The Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) bill developed to create standard rules for crypto businesses operating in EU states was <a href="https://twitter.com/sweden2023eu/status/1663924814002749442?s=20" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/sweden2023eu/status/1663924814002749442?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">officially signed</a> on Wednesday, May 31, and marks a watershed moment for the broader crypto industry. </p>



<p>MiCA&#8217;s policies which introduce a licensing framework are accompanied by new anti-money laundering rules that require exchanges and crypto providers to verify users&#8217; identities. The bill was first proposed in 2020, surviving endless parliamentary debates and revisions. </p>



<p>Controversy threatened to tarnish the bloc&#8217;s crypto rules when lawmakers mulled what was essentially a ban on Proof-of-Work blockchains like Bitcoin due to environmental concerns. Policymakers ultimately binned the idea, giving room for Bitcoin and other PoW-powered assets in European markets.</p>



<p>Nearly three years after its debut, MiCA is now officially into law by the European Parliament President Roberta Metsola and Sweden&#8217;s Rural Affairs Minister Peter Kullgren.</p>



<h2>What Next For MiCA?</h2>



<p>MiCA will be published in the EU&#8217;s Official Journal now that officials have signed. It will take weeks after this publication for MiCA to be recognized and impact the bloc&#8217;s regulatory landscape. However, the rules will not take full effect till 12-18 months after appearing in the Official Journal. This will give policymakers and crypto business time to adjust to the new status quo. </p>



<p>The bill <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/mica-greenlight-eu-finance-ministers/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/mica-greenlight-eu-finance-ministers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">requires </a>trading venues and wallet providers to secure a license before offering their services to EU users. Stablecoin issuers like Tether and Circle must also hold sufficient reserves if they wish to operate in any of the bloc&#8217;s 27-member states. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates published rules for businesses and institutions interacting with cryptocurrencies and digital assets.</li><li>The UAE&#8217;s new guidance will oversee anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing checks in compliance with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) international standards.</li><li>Policymakers from the UAE and Hong Kong are working together on developing digital asset laws as both regions move to establish themselves as global crypto hubs.</li></ul>



<p>On May 31, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Central Bank announced new guidance for anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) set to take effect next month, per <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N37S1OO" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N37S1OO" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reuters</a>.</p>



<p>New rules from the apex bank come amid a push from the Emirates toward attracting crypto businesses looking to expand and tap new markets. Local policymakers also met with companies like Coinbase to discuss regulatory matters. </p>



<p>According to a statement on Wednesday, the new guidance treats the risks associated with handling cryptocurrencies and digital assets like NFTs. The framework will provide needed oversight for institutions when doing business with digital asset service providers like exchanges. Customer and counterparty relationships will also fall under the purview of the newly issued guidance. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The new guidance related to the virtual assets sector contributes to strengthening the supervisory and regulatory frameworks of the Central Bank to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism.</p><cite>&#8211; Governor of the CBUAE, Khaled Mohamed Balama.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Governor Balam further remarked that the new rules will align the Emirati&#8217;s policies with international standards set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The FATF listed the UAE in its &#8220;grey list&#8221; of areas that needed to upgrade their AML and CTF systems back in March 2022. </p>



<h2>Hong Kong And UAE Policymakers Discuss Crypto Rules</h2>



<p>Authorities from the UAE and <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/hong-kong-considers-huobi-crypto-license/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/hong-kong-considers-huobi-crypto-license/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hong Kong</a> are reportedly working together to develop crypto standards needed to protect investors and entice crypto businesses to set up shops in their regions.</p>



<p>The central banks of Hong Kong and UAE recently met in Abu Dhabi to discuss this joint effort. Bank of China, Citi, HSBC, and Standard Chartered spoke for Hong Kong while First Abu Dhabi Bank, Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank, and Emirates NBD represented the Emirati Kingdom. </p>



<p>Cross-border trade and tapping Hong Kong&#8217;s burgeoning financial infrastructure were hot-button topics discussed by senior executives from both sides of the aisle. </p>



<p>Both regions have introduced crypto licensing regimes while Dubai, an emerging crypto hub in the Emirates, was the first jurisdiction to establish a body dedicated to digital asset oversight. Hong Kong&#8217;s licensing regime is set to come into effect starting June 1 after the city-state ended its long-standing crypto ban. </p>



<p>Crypto stakeholders like <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-engage-uae-lawmakers/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-engage-uae-lawmakers/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a> met with UAE policymakers, hailing the region for its approach to digital assets amid the thickening regulatory atmosphere in the U.S. </p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>Law enforcement in China arrested the Trust Reserve team behind a Yuan-backed stablecoin and another token backed by the Hong Kong Dollar. </li><li>Authorities wrote a “judicial seizure” notice at the teams&#8217; office in Shanghai, PANews reported after visiting the building.</li><li>The news follows unverified rumors that Multichain’s team was also arrested in China shortly after a so-called &#8220;force majeure&#8221; froze thousands of transactions on the cross-chain protocol.</li></ul>



<p>Reports from PANews said that police in China arrested team members from Trust Reserve, the entity formerly known as the CNHC Group that issues two fiat-pegged stablecoin backed by China&#8217;s Yuan (CNH) and the Hong Kong Dollar (HKD). </p>



<h2>Trust Reserve Shares Same Faith As Multichain</h2>



<p>Authorities wrote a “judicial seizure” notice at the Trust Reserve office in Shanghai, <a href="https://www.panewslab.com/zh/sqarticledetails/7pomrdow.html?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=auto&amp;_x_tr_hl=en-GB" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.panewslab.com/zh/sqarticledetails/7pomrdow.html?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=auto&amp;_x_tr_hl=en-GB" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PANews</a> reported after visiting the building on May 29. Law enforcement reportedly informed the families of the arrested team members as well. Trust Reserve closed a $10 million series A+ funding round led by Kucoin Ventures in March. </p>



<p>The news follows unverified rumors that Multichain’s team was also <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/deposits-halted-binance-multichain/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/deposits-halted-binance-multichain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrested</a> in China shortly after a so-called &#8220;force majeure&#8221; froze thousands of transactions on the protocol. Liquidity providers like the Fantom Foundations and other stakeholders like Justin Sun pulled out millions from Multichain citing uncertainty about the protocol&#8217;s bridge infrastructure and silence from the team. </p>



<h2>Hong Kong Open To Crypto, Beijing Remains Cautious</h2>



<p>While crypto trading, mining, and digital asset transactions remain banned in China, Beijing&#8217;s government is seemingly ready to consider web3 innovation. The capital city recently released a white paper to promote decentralized development. </p>



<p>Over in Hong Kong, authorities are laying the groundwork for a crypto ecosystem as the region introduced a licensing regime. Huobi HK already applied for a virtual asset exchange license and will offer crypto spot trading support. Other digital asset service providers like OKX are also interested in a similar license per reports. </p>



<p>Hong Kong is also collaborating with the central bank and policymakers in the UAE as both regions move to capture crypto&#8217;s attention amidst a lack of regulatory clarity in the U.S.</p>

<ul><li>The SEC has agreed to settle insider trading charges filed against a former Coinbase manager and his brother.&nbsp;</li><li>The duo was arrested for insider trading crypto assets last year and was convicted for multiple wire fraud charges.&nbsp;</li><li>The settlement has left unanswered the question of whether the nine crypto tokens involved in the case were securities.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has agreed to settle the insider trading charges filed against former Coinbase Manager Ishan Wahi and his brother Nikhil Wahi in the infamous crypto insider trading case from last year. The Wahi brothers were arrested for profiting from an insider trading scheme using material insider information from the American crypto exchange.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Wahis To Return Ill Gotten Gains From Coinbase</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-98" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> from the SEC, the securities regulator and the Wahi brothers have agreed to settle the charges related to the insider trading scheme involving the listing of nine crypto tokens on Coinbase. Both the accused have agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the Securities Exchange Act and return the ill-gotten gains from the crypto exchange, as well as the prejudgement interest. If approved by the Manhattan Federal Court, the SEC will not seek civil penalties against Ishan and Nikhil Wahi in light of their prison sentences. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The federal securities laws do not exempt crypto asset securities from the prohibition against insider trading, nor does the SEC. I am grateful to the SEC staff for successfully working to resolve this matter.” </p><cite>Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement</cite></blockquote>



<p>The settlement between the securities regulator and the Wahi brothers brings the controversial court case to an end. The SEC claimed in its initial complaint that the nine crypto tokens involved in the case were securities. The settlement would leave the question regarding the tokens’ security status unanswered. Ishan Wahi was <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-manager-2-years-insider-trading/">sentenced</a> to two years in prison earlier this month. His brother is currently serving a 10-month prison sentence. The brothers were ordered to forfeit more than $920,000 obtained from their insider trading scheme. </p>

<p>Prosecutors handling the case against <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/shaquille-oneal-served-ftx-lawsuit-again/">FTX’s</a> disgraced founder Sam Bankman-Fried have stated that they may drop some of the criminal charges filed against him. In a recent filing with the Manhattan Federal Court, U.S. prosecutors stated that they would not pursue some criminal counts if they violated the terms of Bankman-Fried’s extradition from the Bahamas. </p>



<h2><strong>FTX Prosecutors Will Drop Charges If The Bahamas Objects</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sam-bankman-fried-could-have-some-charges-dropped-if-bahamas-objects-f3c22fce" rel="noopener">WSJ</a>, the United States Department of Justice stated in the court filing that it would drop the three additional criminal charges that were added to Sam Bankman-Fried’s criminal counts after his extradition from The Bahamas in December last year. The court filing was to express the U.S. government’s opposition to SBF’s motion to dismiss the criminal charges based on the rule of specialty. </p>



<p>Specialty is a principle of international law, which provides that a person who is extradited can be prosecuted or sentenced for the offense(s) for which extradition was granted and not for any other crime committed before extradition took place. Lawyers representing Bankman-Fried requested District Judge Lewis to dismiss the charges filed after the FTX founder’s extradition, which included conspiracy to commit bank fraud and conspiracy to bribe a Chinese official.</p>



<p>The Justice Department urged Judge Kaplan to deny SBF’s motion, describing it as “meritless”. However, the prosecutors stated that they would drop the additional charges if the Bahamas were to deem them a violation of Bankman-Fried’s extradition terms. The federal prosecutors are awaiting approval from the Bahamian government to proceed with the new criminal charges.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The government will proceed on the new charges…if The Bahamas consents to trial on these charges, and will not proceed on those counts if The Bahamas denies the Government’s request”</p><cite>Federal Prosecutors</cite></blockquote>

<ul><li>Binance is exploring a plan to allow some of its traders to keep their trading collateral at a bank.&nbsp;</li><li>The crypto exchange is considering this new step to reduce counterparty risk.</li><li>This facility would be made available to institutional clients for margin trading in spot and derivatives.&nbsp;</li><li>Switzerland’s FlowBank and Liechtenstein&#8217;s Bank Frick are reportedly being considered to facilitate this service.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The world’s largest crypto exchange is reportedly considering allowing some of its traders to store their trading collateral at a bank rather than on the crypto trading platform. Binance’s latest proposal would see traditional banking institutions hold the collateral in order to help reduce the counterparty risk. Two European banks are currently being considered as the institution that would help facilitate the safekeeping of the trading collateral.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Binance Would Lend Stablecoins In Exchange For Clients’ Cash</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-30/binance-may-let-some-clients-keep-trading-collateral-in-bank-accounts#xj4y7vzkg" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, Binance has been in contact with its institutional clients regarding its proposal to allow bank deposits to be used as collateral for margin trading in spot and derivatives. People familiar with the matter revealed that Swiss-based FlowBank and Liechtenstein-based Bank Frick have been tapped as potential intermediaries to help provide this service to the crypto exchange’s customers. It is unclear if the service will be extended to retail traders. </p>



<p>Bloomberg’s request for comment was reportedly denied by a Binance spokesperson. Liechtenstein’s Bank Frick also declined to comment on the matter, citing bank secrecy laws. Switzerland’s FlowBank did not comment on any arrangements with Binance but stated that its banking license didn’t include crypto trading. As per one version of Binance’s proposal, the cash deposits of clients at the bank would be locked up through a tri-party arrangement. The crypto exchange would then lend stablecoins to the clients, which would serve as collateral for margin trading on the platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-invest-banks-pro-crypto-policies/">Binance’s</a> latest plan comes amid increasing scrutiny from clients that are worried about the safety of their funds in the event of the platform’s collapse. The bank deposit feature may help the crypto exchange regain some of the market share it lost this year. Crypto custody has become a major concern in light of the recent bankruptcies and scandals in the crypto industry. Nasdaq Inc, Bank of New York Mellon Corp., and Fidelity Investments are reportedly offering or building crypto custody solutions for institutions.</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Tether plans to tap into Uruguay&#8217;s renewable energy ecosystem and mine Bitcoin (BTC), crypto&#8217;s largest token by market cap.</li><li>The digital payment company is looking to diversify its operations after solidifying USDT&#8217;s position as the top stablecoin with an 83 billion token supply.</li><li>Tether recently started buying Bitcoin with 15% of net realized profits and holds over $1.5 billion in BTC.</li></ul>



<p>Tether, the company that issues crypto&#8217;s largest stablecoin USDT, <a href="https://tether.to/en/tether-invests-in-energy-production-and-sustainable-bitcoin-mining-in-uruguay/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://tether.to/en/tether-invests-in-energy-production-and-sustainable-bitcoin-mining-in-uruguay/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced</a> plans to mine Bitcoin (BTC) in Uruguay using renewable and sustainable energy. </p>



<p>The Company&#8217;s CTO Paolo Ardoino said the Bitcoin mining operation in the South American region will combine &#8220;cutting-edge technology, sustainable practices, and financial innovation.&#8221; Tether&#8217;s plan works in partnership with a locally regulated company yet to be disclosed. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>By harnessing the power of Bitcoin and Uruguay&#8217;s renewable energy capabilities, Tether is leading the way in sustainable and responsible Bitcoin mining. Our unwavering commitment to renewable energy ensures that every Bitcoin we mine leaves a minimal ecological footprint while upholding the security and integrity of the Bitcoin network.</p></blockquote>



<p>Uruguay is a leader in the renewable energy market, generating 94% of its power supply through wind farms, solar parks, and hydropower projects. The USDT issuer believes that Uruguay offers the modern infrastructure needed to sustainably mine BTC.</p>



<p>Today&#8217;s decision also comes at a time when mining is more profitable due to increased activity on the BTC network spurred by <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bitcoin-inscription-ordinals-sold-35btc/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bitcoin-inscription-ordinals-sold-35btc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">memecoins and Ordinals</a>.</p>



<h2>Tether&#8217;s BTC Bag And Stablecoin Dominance</h2>



<p>Tether&#8217;s Bitcoin mining plans follow the company&#8217;s announcement about buying Bitcoin for its stablecoin reserves. According to the issuer, 15% of net realized profits will go towards purchasing more Bitcoins. The company also <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/tether-usdt-integrated-strike-bitcoin/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/tether-usdt-integrated-strike-bitcoin/" rel="noreferrer noopener">integrated</a> with Bitcoin lightning payment app Strike. </p>



<p>Already the company boasts over $1.5 billion in its BTC portfolio along with other assets like gold and treasury bills. This makes USDT&#8217;s issuer one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin but its holdings remain distant from MicroStrategy&#8217;s BTC coffers worth over $4.4 billion. </p>



<p>USDT&#8217;s dominance over the stablecoin market is strengthened following a U.S. banking crisis and enforcement actions that shook rivals like USDC. Tether&#8217;s coin has the highest stablecoin supply in the market with over 83 billion tokens market cap. </p>

<ul><li>The Russian government has abandoned the plan to launch a national cryptocurrency exchange. </li><li>The country will instead establish a regulatory regime for crypto trading platforms. </li><li>Russian authorities intend to use the country’s crypto exchange to facilitate cross-border transactions. </li><li>The country&#8217;s Central Bank will likely be in charge of regulating the crypto exchanges. </li></ul>



<p>Russia’s ambitious plan to establish a national cryptocurrency exchange has come to an end just six months after it was initially unveiled. The government instead plans to set up a regulatory infrastructure to oversee the development and operations of the country’s crypto trading platforms. The authorities aim to reduce the risk of inviting further <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/us-ukraine-russian-crypto-sanction-evader/">sanctions</a> while promoting competition in the crypto market.</p>



<h2><strong>Russia Will Use Crypto Exchanges For Cross-Border Settlements</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://iz.ru/1519017/mariia-kolobova/novyi-bitok-v-rossii-poiaviatsia-pravila-sozdaniia-i-raboty-kriptobirzh" rel="nofollow noopener">Izvestia</a>, the Russian government has abandoned a plan to create a national crypto exchange in favor of healthy competition in the market. Anatoly Aksakov, Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Financial Markets, told Izvestia that the government is now planning to set up a regulatory regime to regulate the country’s crypto exchanges. This would allow local businesses to settle cross-border transactions. Chairman Aksakov added that the new plan would also help local businesses to avoid the sanctions placed against the country. </p>



<p>Russia’s Ministry of Finance is reportedly on board with the revised plan to regulate the country’s crypto trading platforms. Ivan Chebeskov, Director of the Finance Ministry’s Financial Policy Department, told Izvestia that the Ministry was never keen on the idea of setting up a national crypto exchange. The Ministry is reportedly in favor of legally regulating such platforms. The Central Bank of the Russian Federation will likely regulate the country’s crypto trading platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Russian authorities are hoping to foster the growth and development of new crypto exchanges through the revised regulatory policy for the crypto industry. It would also help minimize the risks of sanctions and infrastructure cyberattacks. The government’s decision to drop the national crypto exchange plan was welcomed by major crypto firms in the country. The plan received considerable opposition ever since it was unveiled in November last year. </p>
