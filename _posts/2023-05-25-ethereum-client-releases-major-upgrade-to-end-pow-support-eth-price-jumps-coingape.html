<p>Ethereum client Go-Ethereum has officially released the Geth v1.12.0 version (Krogam DMZ). The latest update will no longer support proof of work (POW), so it can no longer be used for PoW-based private chains or as a dependency on ethash PoW. Ethereum has transitioned to proof-of-stake (PoS) but some related chains still use PoW consensus <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="https://coingape.com/ethereum-client-releases-update-pow-support-eth-price/" title="Ethereum Client Releases Major Upgrade To End PoW Support, ETH Price Jumps"></a></p>
