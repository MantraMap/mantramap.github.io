			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Chicago, Illinois, August 8th, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>For years, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) have been the favored methods of payment for cybercriminals. Ransomware crime rings rely almost exclusively on Bitcoin payments to extract vast sums from major institutions, including hospitals and providers of critical infrastructure. But, in a groundbreaking move, a&nbsp;federal court case&nbsp;in Chicago has turned the tables on cybercriminals by using inventive technology to digitally lock the criminals out of their blockchain accounts.</p><p>The case was brought against Russian and North Korean hackers who are under sanctions by the United States Treasury Department.</p>Mike Kanovitz, CEO of&nbsp;Jurat Blockchains, the firm behind the technology deployed in the case, remarked, &ldquo;It is encouraging to witness this invention in action, fighting criminals who misuse blockchains and give cryptocurrency a bad name.&rdquo; Kanovitz explained that &ldquo;Jurat technology provides the base layer for legal enforcement on blockchains by working in conjunction with official courts. It can help government officials prevent crime and lets cryptocurrency users access courts if they have had their cryptocurrency stolen, been defrauded, or lost their private keys.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>The court&rsquo;s order applies to 16 individuals and international criminal organizations sanctioned under Executive Orders of the President of the United States. Among those targeted was Hydra Market, the focus of &ldquo;a collaborative initiative joined by the U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigations, Drug Enforcement Administration, Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, and Homeland Security Investigations,&rdquo; according to a&nbsp;U.S. Treasury Department press release.&nbsp;&nbsp;Another major target named in the lawsuit is the&nbsp;Lazarus Group, which engaged in &ldquo;malicious cyber activities and money-laundering of stolen virtual currency&rdquo; on behalf of the Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of Korea.&nbsp;The state-sponsored hackers committed &ldquo;the largest virtual currency heist to date, worth almost $620 million, from a blockchain project linked to the online game Axie Infinity.&rdquo;</p><p>Using the first-of-its-kind judicial injunction, the federal court has locked all accounts belonging to the 16 criminals that contain the cryptocurrency $JTC. The coin emerged following an update to Bitcoin&rsquo;s software, resulting in a &ldquo;fork&rdquo; that left two blockchains, BTC and JTC, hosting the same accounts.

<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Hope.money launches its decentralized lending ecosystem, HopeLend.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">The project aims to reward all participants, including depositors, borrowers, and lenders.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope.money, a pioneer in bridging DeFi to CeFi and TradFi, has launched HopeLend, a decentralized lending protocol, on the Ethereum network. In an announcement this Tuesday, HopeLend, a decentralized, non-custodial lending protocol, aims to revolutionize the borrowing and lending systems across decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, allowing users to effectively utilize and interact with digital assets within the HOPE ecosystem and across other DeFi platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding the launch, Flex Yang, Founder of Hope.money, said HopeLend will increase the overall liquidity across DeFi ecosystems and reward all participants on the platform to incentivize decentralized borrowing and lending services.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The debut of HopeLend is a milestone for Hope.money, as it represents an important move toward completing its all-in-one ecosystem,&rdquo; Yang said. &ldquo;The non-custodial lending protocol enables all users to benefit from it by increasing liquidity for the HOPE Ecosystem through deposits, loans, and liquidations, and rewarding them with $LT.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In addition, HopeLend will also significantly improve the capital efficiency and users&rsquo; liquidity within the DeFi space, allowing any user to borrow and lend within the protocol. This blends well with the protocol&rsquo;s goals of providing frictionless and transparent financial infrastructure for everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike legacy DeFi borrowing platforms, HopeLend introduces a pool-based system of borrowing, whereby users directly borrow and deposit to a pool. This eliminates the need for individual loan pairing, making the process of depositing and borrowing easy and frictionless.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope.money aims to provide an all-in-one financial ecosystem, providing comprehensive utility for its decentralized stablecoin, $HOPE, including swaps, custodial services, clearing and settlement. The launch of HopeLend increases the utility of the stablecoin and will provide a &ldquo;solid foundation for $HOPE&rsquo;s future success as a stablecoin&rdquo;, Yang added.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notwithstanding, HopeLend will also reward every contributor on the platform (depositors, borrowers and lenders) with its governance token, $LT, adding an extra layer of benefits on top of the standard interest income and borrowing services. The rewards distribution will be calculated using the relative Gauge Weights and utilization rates of various asset pools. Apart from regular loans, HopeLend will also offer users flash loans &ndash; loans that are borrowed and paid back in one transaction without having to own the assets.&nbsp;</p>
Hope.money steps up as a leading DeFi protocol
<p>The launch of HopeLend signifies the potential of Hope.money to become a leading protocol in the broader Ethereum DeFi ecosystem. Earlier this month, the protocol added stETH in Hope.money&rsquo;s reserve pool, which diversifies the assets on the protocol and strengthens the utility and value of $HOPE stablecoin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, the platform is enhancing the security of users&rsquo; funds by forming partnerships with established and trusted digital asset custodians. Following its partnership with Coinbase Custody in April, Hope.money announced a strategic partnership with Cobo, another leading digital asset custodial services provider.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s6">If you are searching for a project that can make you a millionaire over the coming years, Pomerdoge is one cryptocurrency that you shouldn&rsquo;t miss out on. Convinced by its growth projections and presale performance, experts believe that Pomerdoge&rsquo;s value can rise by 40x this year.</p>
Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) have moved downward in recent months.
<p class="s8">Summary:</p>
● Solana&rsquo;s (SOL) social engagements have plummeted by 53% in the past week
● Ethereum (ETH) is planning to launch the Dencun upgrade by the year-end
● Pomerdoge&rsquo;s presale tokens are selling out fast during Stage 1
<p>Click Here To Find Out More About The Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale</p>
Solana (SOL) Sees Drop In Social Metric
<p class="s6">Amid the bullish market sentiments, Solana (SOL) has seen growth in a key metric. The total value locked (TVL) of Solana (SOL) has increased over the past few months. The rise in Solana&rsquo;s (SOL) TVL has been caused largely because of the increase in the LSD (Liquid Staking Derivatives) vertical.</p>
<p class="s6">Data shows that Jito, an LSD protocol operating on Solana (SOL), has seen a massive uptick after the Shapella upgrade. However, social engagements on the Solana (SOL) network have dropped by 53% in the past week. Besides, social mentions for Solana (SOL) have tumbled by 47%. Thus, the market price of Solana (SOL) has fallen by 10% in the past week.</p>
<p class="s6">Subsequently, Solana (SOL) is trading at $22.53.</p>
Ethereum (ETH) Set To Launch A New Upgrade
<p class="s6">The Ethereum (ETH) network has been on a roll to launch new updates. A few months ago, Ethereum (ETH) had launched its much-awaited Shapella upgrade.</p>
<p class="s6">Ethereum (ETH) has intensified its efforts on the upcoming Cancun-Deneb upgrade. However, the news regarding the Dencun upgrade has not caused any positive response for the price of Ethereum (ETH). Notably, the trading price of Ethereum (ETH) has tumbled by 3% in the past seven days. As a result, an Ethereum (ETH) token can now be traded at $1,826.29.</p>
<p class="s6">Also known as Dencun, the upcoming upgrade will improve the security and scalability of the Ethereum (ETH) network. Reportedly, Ethereum (ETH) may launch the upgrade by the end of 2023.</p>
Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale Makes Big Waves
<p class="s6">According to a report, the global blockchain gaming market can grow from $4.6 billion in 2022 to $65.7 billion by 2027. Thus, Pomerdoge has developed a new blockchain game that will disrupt the play-to-earn gaming arena. The new P2E game, named Pomergame, is equipped with many rich and unique features. Therefore, it has generated big market waves even before its launch in the market.</p>
<p class="s6">According to experts, Pomerdoge is different from meme coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, or Pepe. Pomerdoge is a mix of fun and earning. Hence, you get paid for all the time you spend on the game. Its ecosystem consists of three major elements.</p>
<p class="s6">The first element is Pomergame, where you will be able to play, create, and level up your character to elite status. The Pomerplace is the second element, where you will get an opportunity to sell your custom in-game assets to other members, or battle with gamers across the globe. The last element is a unique collection of 7,777 NFTs.</p>
<p class="s6">Pomerdoge&rsquo;s business roadmap has revealed that it will launch POMD tokens on Uniswap after the presale round. At present, the presale of POMD tokens is in its first stage, and its price is $0.007. However, analysts have predicted that POMD&rsquo;s value can skyrocket by 1700% by the end of the presale round. So, hurry before it&rsquo;s too late.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="s6">If you are searching for a project that can make you a millionaire over the coming years, Pomerdoge is one cryptocurrency that you shouldn&rsquo;t miss out on. Convinced by its growth projections and presale performance, experts believe that Pomerdoge&rsquo;s value can rise by 40x this year.</p>
Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) have moved downward in recent months.
<p class="s8">Summary:</p>
● Solana&rsquo;s (SOL) social engagements have plummeted by 53% in the past week
● Ethereum (ETH) is planning to launch the Dencun upgrade by the year-end
● Pomerdoge&rsquo;s presale tokens are selling out fast during Stage 1

Solana (SOL) Sees Drop In Social Metric
<p class="s6">Amid the bullish market sentiments, Solana (SOL) has seen growth in a key metric. The total value locked (TVL) of Solana (SOL) has increased over the past few months. The rise in Solana&rsquo;s (SOL) TVL has been caused largely because of the increase in the LSD (Liquid Staking Derivatives) vertical.</p>
<p class="s6">Data shows that Jito, an LSD protocol operating on Solana (SOL), has seen a massive uptick after the Shapella upgrade. However, social engagements on the Solana (SOL) network have dropped by 53% in the past week. Besides, social mentions for Solana (SOL) have tumbled by 47%. Thus, the market price of Solana (SOL) has fallen by 10% in the past week.</p>
<p class="s6">Subsequently, Solana (SOL) is trading at $22.53.</p>
Ethereum (ETH) Set To Launch A New Upgrade
<p class="s6">The Ethereum (ETH) network has been on a roll to launch new updates. A few months ago, Ethereum (ETH) had launched its much-awaited Shapella upgrade.</p>
<p class="s6">Ethereum (ETH) has intensified its efforts on the upcoming Cancun-Deneb upgrade. However, the news regarding the Dencun upgrade has not caused any positive response for the price of Ethereum (ETH). Notably, the trading price of Ethereum (ETH) has tumbled by 3% in the past seven days. As a result, an Ethereum (ETH) token can now be traded at $1,826.29.</p>
<p class="s6">Also known as Dencun, the upcoming upgrade will improve the security and scalability of the Ethereum (ETH) network. Reportedly, Ethereum (ETH) may launch the upgrade by the end of 2023.</p>
Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale Makes Big Waves
<p class="s6">According to a report, the global blockchain gaming market can grow from $4.6 billion in 2022 to $65.7 billion by 2027. Thus, Pomerdoge has developed a new blockchain game that will disrupt the play-to-earn gaming arena. The new P2E game, named Pomergame, is equipped with many rich and unique features. Therefore, it has generated big market waves even before its launch in the market.</p>
<p class="s6">According to experts, Pomerdoge is different from meme coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, or Pepe. Pomerdoge is a mix of fun and earning. Hence, you get paid for all the time you spend on the game. Its ecosystem consists of three major elements.</p>
<p class="s6">The first element is Pomergame, where you will be able to play, create, and level up your character to elite status. The Pomerplace is the second element, where you will get an opportunity to sell your custom in-game assets to other members, or battle with gamers across the globe. The last element is a unique collection of 7,777 NFTs.</p>
<p class="s6">Pomerdoge&rsquo;s business roadmap has revealed that it will launch POMD tokens on Uniswap after the presale round. At present, the presale of POMD tokens is in its first stage, and its price is $0.007. However, analysts have predicted that POMD&rsquo;s value can skyrocket by 1700% by the end of the presale round. So, hurry before it&rsquo;s too late.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s7">The DeFi space is experiencing a surge of innovation and interest, with Tradecurve, Solana, and Chainlink at the forefront. Particularly eye-catching is Tradecurve, now in its presale phase where early investors can acquire tokens for just $0.025 before the predicted 50-fold rise. Let's take a closer look at these three DeFi projects and how they are revolutionizing the industry.</p>
Tradecurve (TCRV): 50-Fold Gains on the Horizon to Surge Past Solana (SOL) and Chainlink (LINK)
<p class="s7">Traditional crypto exchange sign-ups can feel like walking through a maze: the invasive KYC checks, the complexity of user interfaces, the endless waiting &ndash; it all adds up to a stressful experience. Enter Tradecurve, a groundbreaking trading platform that's on a mission to turn the tables.</p>
<p class="s7">Tradecurve is all about simplicity and anonymity, doing away with the tedious KYC procedures that often hinder traders. All you'll need is an email address and a bit of cryptocurrency, and the diverse world of trading is yours to explore. Whether you're interested in cryptocurrencies, forex, commodities, or stocks, Tradecurve's doors are open.</p>
<p class="s7">Whether you want to mimic successful trading strategies through copy trading, utilize AI-driven automation, or earn passive income with staking, Tradecurve's robust suite of advanced features ensures you have every tool to stay ahead in the trading game.</p>
<p class="s7">The magic key to all these exciting offerings is the TCRV token, Tradecurve's native digital asset. With TCRV, you can pay transaction fees, earn staking rewards, access top-tier trading tools, and much more.</p>
<p class="s7">During phase 5 of the ongoing presale event, early adopters can grab TCRV at the steal price of $0.025. With a flurry of activity that has already seen over 20 million tokens sold in just one week, this special price won't last long. Phase 6 will see the price rise to $0.029.</p>
<p class="s7">Experts predict that Tradecurve's journey is only beginning. As the platform's reputation grows and the demand for TCRV increases, its value could soar to $1.00 and even higher.</p>
Solana (SOL): Get Ready for a New Era of DeFi 2.0
<p class="s7">Solana has been riding a wave of bullish momentum, rebounding after a period of overselling tied to negative news and events. Traders and investors are once again taking note of its original potential that led to 10,000% gains in 2021.</p>
<p class="s7">This optimism is backed by technical analysis, as Solana broke free from a Symmetrical Triangle pattern to grow from $18.70 to $32 in just nine days. The price has since adjusted to a $25 support level and left Solana enthusiasts in suspense.</p>
<p class="s7">Platforms like Hxro Network and Crema are turning to Solana as a fertile ground for developing the next generation of decentralized finance applications. Ethereum is still too slow to handle the latest DeFi protocols, but Solana is more than capable of taking the lead.</p>
<p class="s7">While it is unlikely for Solana to outperform Tradecurve, the asset is still expected to break out of the current range toward $80 in the not-too-distant future.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>
Chainlink (LINK): CCIP Protocol and Swift Partnership Leads to 20% Gains
<p class="s7">Chainlink is a strong contender to become the leading provider of blockchain oracles, allowing DeFi projects to connect smart contracts to real-world data. This has been further cemented by its collaboration with Google Cloud and other industry leaders.</p>
<p class="s7">And it just got better this week &ndash; Chainlink announced the launch of its Cross-Chain Integration Protocol (CCIP), allowing Swift to use Chainklink's technology to send data between various blockchain networks.</p>
<p class="s7">Chainlink has seen its value grow due to these developments, with a 20% price increase over a 7-day period. The price of Chainlink has since cooled off and returned to $7.09. Analysts note that Chainlink has been suppressed under the $10 resistance for over a year, so any further gains won't occur until it breaks past that barrier.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The ambitious social metaverse and Web3 startup Peer has hit a major milestone with the launch of its next-generation social app, available to download on iOS devices from today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Peer app is a novel social experience created using augmented reality technology and a proprietary ecosystem that enables people to explore and interact with the world around them in new ways, the startup explains.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the world&rsquo;s a game and Peer makes everyone a player,&rdquo; said Peer founder and Chief Executive Tony Tran. &ldquo;Get ready for a new kind of social network that&rsquo;s all about fun, joy and gamification at its core.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Peer, the app combines geo-location technology with adaptive 3D maps to create a &ldquo;game-like experience&rdquo; of the physical world. With Peer, users will be able to customize and share maps of their own, unique social world, pinning their stories, memories and moments to real-world locations for others to find.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To understand what Peer is really about, try to think of it as a social network experienced in AR graphics overlaid across the real world. With it, users will be able to explore their physical location and locate digital objects and information that&rsquo;s posted within their surroundings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Peer will make it possible to overlay 3D graphics on top of the real world, integrating new experiences into our everyday lives. Unlike other social networks which simply focus on getting people to scroll through a newsfeed with their eyes glued to their device, Peer genuinely wants to get people out and about, interacting with real people and locations in the physical world. As part of this approach, users will be incentivized to post and explore digital content that&rsquo;s tied to specific geographic locations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Someone who&rsquo;s feeling hungry will be able to use Peer to facilitate their search for a bite to eat. Simply open up the Peer map and look for nearby restaurants, and you&rsquo;ll find directions overlaid onto the real world to make it easier to find them. As that person arrives at their chosen eatery, they may be able to pick up a digital coupon posted outside by the owner of the business, giving them a 10% discount on their meal. At the same time, the user will be able to check reviews from previous customers, helping them to decide if they want to give the menu a try.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Businesses will be able to use Peer to enhance their marketing efforts in creative ways. As an example, Peer created a video showing how an aquarium or dinosaur museum might get the attention of visitors by creating marine animals that swim across the skies, or virtual dinosaurs that roam around outside, enticing people to come and take a closer look.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Peer explains, the Peer app is designed to enable discovery, community-building and other kinds of real-life activities. It will act as a creative canvas anyone can use to design and develop digital experiences that enhance our lives in the real world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an ambitious idea that has the potential to achieve one of the major promises of the metaverse, morphing digital elements into physical reality.</p>
<p>Peer said the Peer app is available to download on iOS devices now from the Apple App Store, and will be joined by an Android version that&rsquo;s due to launch later this year. The company is also reported to be working on an AR headset that will make it possible to experience Peer in the most immersive way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, iOS users can expect to see additional features arrive in Peer soon. &ldquo;In the coming months, we will deepen AI integration and deploy features that are sure to spark a new era of global interconnectedness,&rdquo; Tran promised. &ldquo;No social network puts the world in your hands like Peer.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Large Stops Below 27991:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 9 August 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) awaited fresh technical guidance early in the Asian session as the pair remained unable to sustain moves above the 29500 area and continues to battle with areas of technical resistance.&nbsp; &nbsp;The inability to revisit last month&rsquo;s multi-month high around the 31862 area has resulted in bearish momentum and has seen the pair orbit the 28960 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the appreciating range from 19568.52 to 31862.21.&nbsp; &nbsp;Large Stops are cited below the 27991.29 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the broader appreciating range from 15460 to 31862.21.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional areas of technical support and potential buying pressure in these appreciating ranges include the 27466, 27166, 26428, 26272, and 25715 areas.</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) awaited fresh technical guidance early in the Asian session as the pair remained unable to sustain moves above the 29500 area and continues to battle with areas of technical resistance.&nbsp; &nbsp;The inability to revisit last month&rsquo;s multi-month high around the 31862 area has resulted in bearish momentum and has seen the pair orbit the 28960 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the appreciating range from 19568.52 to 31862.21.&nbsp; &nbsp;Large Stops are cited below the 27991.29 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the broader appreciating range from 15460 to 31862.21.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional areas of technical support and potential buying pressure in these appreciating ranges include the 27466, 27166, 26428, 26272, and 25715 areas.</p>
<p>Additional downside price objectives linked to recent selling pressure include the 28432, 28213, 28137, 27979, 27757, 27430, 27409, 27338, 27312, 27246, 26501, 26348, and 26199 levels.&nbsp; Also, the 28095.44 area represents the 23.6% retracement of the historic depreciating range from 69000 to 15460.&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the market, upside price objectives include the 30526, 30611, 30762, and 31145 areas.&nbsp; Upside price objectives related to other levels of buying pressure include the 32125 and 33569 areas, and Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 32043, 34531, 34658, and 35912 areas.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;below the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and below the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 29176.03 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 29041.31.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The law firm representing FTX, Fenwick &amp; West, has been slapped with a class action lawsuit by a group of FTX customers for allegedly aiding in fraud. </p>
<p>Fenwick &amp; West, the law firm representing the fallen crypto exchange FTX, has been sued by a group of former FTX customers. The customers accused the firm of aiding in fraud via its legal advice to the exchange, Reuters reports.</p>
FTX Lawyers Face Class Action Lawsuit
<p>According to the complaint lodged on August 7, Fenwick &amp; West allegedly offered service to the exchange that &ldquo;went well beyond those a law firm should and usually does provide.&rdquo; The complaint states the firm&rsquo;s services included structuring transactions to avoid regulatory attention and setting up entities that helped FTX&rsquo;s former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, and other exchange executives engage in fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>The current complaint is the second to be lodged against Fenwick concerning its dealings with FTX. Previous reports state that the firm Gibson Dunn was appointed to represent Fenwick on similar issues related to the exchange, including in the criminal case against SBF and a federal class action lawsuit.</p>
<p>According to the court filing, Fenwick acted as the primary outside legal representative for the now-bankrupt exchange and therefore had a unique insight into FTX&rsquo;s &ldquo;convoluted organizational structure, abject lack of internal controls, and dubious business practices,&rdquo; Reuters reports.</p>
<p>The dealings between Fenwick and FTX also extend to Daniel Friedberg. Mr Friedberg was a leading regulatory attorney for the exchange and joined FTX in 2020 from Fenwick. FTX&rsquo;s new management is now suing Friedberg.</p>
Fenwick Allegedly Helps Conceal FTX Executives&rsquo; Use of Customer Fund for Speculative Investments
<p>The complaint further alleges that Fenwick &amp; West assisted in setting up two entities used to hide exchange executives&rsquo; use of customer funds to make speculative investments and political donations.</p>
<p>The law firm allegedly also advised on transactions that helped the exchange obtain regulatory licenses without having to apply directly to the necessary regulators.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>According to Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett, the US government debt is predicted to rise to $50 trillion by 2033.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the astonishing and ridiculous state our financial system has got into, and the vast majority of US citizens will probably just shrug their shoulders and carry on.</p>
An unfair downgrade?
<p>That the US was recently downgraded from triple A to double A+ was heavily lamented in US government and banking circles. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen called it &ldquo;puzzling&rdquo;, &ldquo;entirely unwarranted&rdquo;, and a &ldquo;flawed assessment&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan, said that the downgrade was &ldquo;ridiculous&rdquo; and that &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t really matter&rdquo;, and that the markets would decide rather than the Fitch rating agency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both of these heads of finance were hardly going to say that Fitch was absolutely right to make the downgrade, and so their hollow protests were probably to be expected. However, many will take them at their word and wonder why Fitch made this awful decision&hellip;</p>
Of course we can print money out of thin air, we&rsquo;re the US government
<p>So the already impossible and insurmountable US debt figure is set to rise from the current $32.5 trillion to around $50 trillion over the next 10 years. Given that this is a figure produced by a banker, perhaps the eventual figure might even be much higher.</p>
<p>In congress, there are those who revel in the special privilege that the US wields with the dollar as the world&rsquo;s reserve currency. Brad Sherman is a staunchly anti-crypto congressman, always using his power and influence to malign and demean Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When accusing &ldquo;crypto bros&rdquo; of printing $1 trillion from thin air during a key congressional committee, he speculated that these same people might accuse the US government of doing the same thing. He said &ldquo;perhaps we do&rdquo; and vindicated the act by saying &ldquo;we&rsquo;re the US government&rdquo;. When certain congressmen/women and senators have such a view, it is no wonder the US is in the impossible situation it is in.&nbsp;</p>
From the dollar sinking ship to the Bitcoin liferaft
<p>So, we know that the US is going to add to its debt mountain over the next 10 years at least, as it spends like a drunken sailor, injecting scandalous amounts of new currency into the system, leading to currency debasement on a massive scale and leaving its citizens to shoulder the cost.</p>
<p>Bitcoin on the other hand has a fixed supply built into its code. As its halving approaches in April of next year and its supply is cut in half, expect a tsunami of wealth to leave the sinking ship which is the dollar and climb aboard the Bitcoin liferaft.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is nearing a critical crossroads concerning ARK's application for a spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). With the August 13 deadline on the horizon, the financial world watches closely for the SEC's decisive verdict.</p>
Potential Delay Until 2024
<p>ARK Invest&rsquo;s official Bitcoin ETF submission on May 15 kicked off the SEC's countdown clock. It was followed by another filing on June 15 which preset the deadline as August 15, by which the SEC must express its approval or disapproval.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the SEC can prolong the waiting game by 240 days, pushing the final response to January 10, 2024, for ARK Invest&rsquo;s proposal and March 2024 for other applicants.</p>
<p>Speaking on the topic, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood noted that there is a high probability of the SEC delaying the matter further.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When asked about the August deadline, Wood said,&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I think you're probably right that Aug. 13 will come and go. I think the SEC, if it's going to approve a bitcoin ETF, will approve more than one at once."</p>

A Crowded Field of Aspirants
<p>ARK isn't alone in its quest for a spot Bitcoin ETF. Numerous organizations, including Bitwise, BlackRock, VanEck, WisdomTree, Valkyrie, First Trust Galaxy, and Fidelity Wise Origin, have entered the Bitcoin ETF fray. Grayscale also seeks to convert its Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. If the SEC greenlights any one of these applications, the call for fair and equal approvals among the other applicants will gain extra momentum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This wave of applications stands apart due to a "surveillance sharing" pact with exchanges like Nasdaq and Cboe. The agreement's goal is to exchange market trading data, customer ID info, and clearing activity details. This move aims to curb market manipulation risks and protect investor funds against unauthorized use, addressing previous SEC concerns.</p>
SEC's Reserved Move - The Waiting Game
<p>Observers speculate that the SEC won't budge unless compelled. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust's lawsuit serves as inspiration on how to tackle the agency and its unbudging stance on ETFs. The court case has prompted the SEC to clarify its stance, highlighting its approval of Bitcoin futures agreements with similar monitoring provisions. This legal tussle may lead to a more transparent decision-making process.</p>
<p>While optimism grows in the crypto community, doubts remain about the SEC's approval of a Spot Bitcoin ETF. Critics recall the SEC's decade-long streak of rejecting such applications. Nevertheless, the approval of a leveraged Bitcoin ETF and a surge in Ethereum futures ETF applications hint at a shifting regulatory environment. Bloomberg Intelligence gives a 65% chance for approval, considering the Grayscale lawsuit and potential political influences.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Nowadays, no one manually searches for crypto spreads anymore; everyone uses bots for cryptocurrency arbitrage. There are two types of arbitrage bots: automatic and manual.</p>
What are the differences?
<p>Automatic arbitrage bots are bots where you set limits on spreads, coins, and exchanges. The bots themselves place orders or buy cryptocurrencies. All automatic bots work through APIs. Due to this, the risk of using automatic bots is significantly higher since you are essentially granting access to your funds to a third-party application.</p>
<p>Manual arbitrage bots are bots that provide information on spreads through separate applications, messengers, or even SMS. You still choose the limits, coins, and exchanges.</p>
<p>Today, we will review arbitrage bots and rank them based on the following criteria:</p>
<p>1. Security</p>
<p>2. User reviews</p>
<p>3. Functionality</p>
<p>4. Prices</p>
<p>5. Additional features</p>
<p>We will evaluate each criterion on a 5-point scale and calculate the arithmetic mean to determine the best cryptocurrency arbitrage bot.</p>
ArbitrageScanner
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's start with the first-place bot - ArbitrageScanner with a rating of 4.8.</p>
<p>This service supports 60 CEX exchanges, 40 DEX exchanges, and more than 30 blockchains! The service even supports local exchanges in Turkey, Korea, and Latin America. Let's break down why it is ranked number one for cryptocurrency arbitrage scanning.</p>
<p>1. Security: 5/5</p>
<p>ArbitrageScanner is a manual cryptocurrency arbitrage bot. It sends you notifications about exchange rate differences on Telegram. This bot works without requesting API access, meaning all possible risks associated with your funds are eliminated. All exchanges connected to ArbitrageScanner have been verified and are safe to use.</p>
<p>2. ArbitrageScanner.io reviews: 5/5</p>
<p>We couldn't find any significant negative reviews online. There were a couple of users who were dissatisfied that the service wasn't working, but we verified that the project's official channels mentioned technical work, updates, and expanded functionality. Users' reviews in personal blogs are positive, and reviews from news resources are also positive.</p>
<p>3. Functionality: 5/5</p>
<p>The scanner works with a vast number of CEX, DEX, and blockchains. It is the most accurate scanner based on our measurements, always showing you the current cryptocurrency prices on exchanges. This alone gives it a high rating, but the service's development team has also created a screener for cryptocurrency arbitrage, which we'll discuss further in the Additional Features section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>4. Prices: 4/5</p>
<p>The minimum tariff costs $70, but we recommend paying attention to the Expert tariff at $399. It is ideal for both beginner and expert arbitrage traders. Opting for a more expensive tariff provides increased limits, allowing you to set up 30 different coins simultaneously, 15 different Telegram channels, and more. What caught our attention the most is that this tariff includes free access to the second service we mentioned earlier - the Arbitrage Screener. Additionally, you gain access to an arbitrage trader community, where experienced specialists share successful strategies, insights, and current spreads that can be profitable. The price of $399 doesn't seem too high, especially when you are offered numerous earning opportunities. There is also a free trial available.</p>
<p>5. Additional features: 5/5</p>
<p>Under additional features, we consider what the service offers besides its main product. ArbitrageScanner provides numerous additional functions.</p>
<p>- Closed chat for arbitrage traders, where both the scanner team and the community share cases and hot opportunities.</p>
<p>- Educational materials, providing training on how to use the scanner, real cases, how to find arbitrage opportunities, and how to set up the service.</p>
<p>- Screener: This is the second product available to users with Pro and higher subscriptions. It displays all possible spreads that you set up across different exchanges and coins. This tool complements the scanner perfectly. You configure the screener to find the exchanges and coins with the largest spreads at that moment. Then, you switch to the scanner, set the settings for those exchanges and coins, and it shows you the most current spreads. Perfect for those who want to earn profits!</p>
<p>- The website offers a free profitability calculator for arbitrage. Even if you don't have a subscription yet, you can calculate how much you can earn on arbitrage with a specific cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>- Some users have been given access to beta testing of another product called Telegram Scanner. This tool allows you to search for all mentions of your chosen cryptocurrency or topic in all Telegram chats. It sends all mentions of your keyword to a separate chat, and with a single click, you can respond to the original messages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
3Commas
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In second place, we have 3Commas with a rating of 4.2.</p>
<p>This is one of the most popular automatic bots at the moment, suitable for cryptocurrency arbitrage. However, it has its small downsides:</p>
<p>1. Security: 4/5</p>
<p>While this bot has not been associated with fund theft or hacking, we cannot give it the highest rating. It uses APIs for operation, like all automatic bots, which poses a security threat to your finances.</p>
<p>2. User reviews: 4/5</p>
<p>User reviews are generally good, but there are negative reviews regarding the service's performance. Some users complain about the delayed support response, but we do not consider these to be critical drawbacks of the project.</p>
<p>3. Functionality: 4/5</p>
<p>The service offers automatic arbitrage, but only on a single exchange. Due to the large number of users, it is very difficult to automatically earn profits using this service as there is significant competition among arbitrage traders using the same bot. There is inter-exchange arbitrage available on 16 CEX exchanges, but compared to the number supported by the first-place service in our ranking, this seems very limited. Moreover, 3Commas does not support DEX exchanges, which are now considered the new frontier for arbitrage opportunities.</p>
<p>4. Prices: 5/5</p>
<p>The service offers a 7-day free trial, which is much longer than its competitors. The tariff prices range from $29 to $99, which is quite competitive for the services provided.</p>
<p>5. Additional features: 4/5</p>
<p>This is the most interesting aspect, considering what additional features each product offers. 3Commas provides:</p>
<p>- 5 bots for manual trading and 9 for automatic trading, but most of them are available in the highest subscription.</p>
<p>- A demo account where you can try out your strategies.</p>
<p>- An internal portfolio rebalancer.</p>
Bitsgap
<p></p>
<p>In the third place in our ranking is Bitsgap with a rating of 3.6.</p>
<p>This is an automatic bot that supports 15 CEX exchanges.</p>
<p>1. Security: 4/5</p>
<p>As we mentioned before, automatic bots are not safe to use. Here, we encounter the first confirmation of this statement. Some users reported that funds went missing from their accounts. It could be malicious competition, but we cannot overlook these statements.</p>
<p>2. User reviews: 3/5</p>
<p>User reviews are mixed, with complaints about poor support, delayed bot performance, and some exchanges periodically not functioning. As mentioned before, there are also claims about missing funds. On the other hand, some users did not experience such issues. While we cannot recommend using this bot, we also cannot claim that it is developed by dishonest developers.</p>
<p>3. Functionality: 4/5</p>
<p>The functionality does not stand out among automatic arbitrage bots. It supports 15 CEX exchanges and lacks DEX exchanges. Otherwise, it duplicates or even lacks certain features compared to 3Commas.</p>
<p>4. Prices: 5/5</p>
<p>The minimum tariff is $23, and the maximum is $119. The difference between tariffs is minimal, and in the market, this is a relatively high price for the services provided.</p>
<p>5. Additional features: 2/5</p>
<p>The service offers an arbitrage profitability blog and knowledge base, and unfortunately, that's all the additional functionality it provides.</p>
Coinrule
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fourth place on the list of arbitrage bots is Coinrule with a rating of 3.4.</p>
<p>This is an automatic bot for arbitrage that supports 10 CEX exchanges.</p>
<p>1. Security: 2/5</p>
<p>Once again, this is an automatic bot that uses API. There are also articles about users of this bot losing their funds, but we cannot vouch for the accuracy of this information. It could also be the work of competitors, but we cannot ignore these claims.</p>
<p>2. User reviews: 3/5</p>
<p>User reviews are mixed. Many find it challenging to work with, even for experienced arbitrage traders. There are also negative reviews about missing funds, as mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>3. Functionality: 4/5</p>
<p>The bot supports only 10 CEX exchanges, and configuring it requires significant effort. Its functionality does not stand out compared to other automatic bots we reviewed today.</p>
<p>4. Prices: 5/5</p>
<p>The price for this product is $30 - $450 per month, which is above average considering the intuitiveness of the service's management and prices for similar features among competitors.</p>
<p>5. Additional features: 3/5</p>
<p>- Marketplace of arbitrage strategies&nbsp;</p>
HaasOnline
<p></p>
<p>In the fifth place in our ranking is HaasOnline with a rating of 2.8.</p>
<p>It is also an automatic bot that shows spreads between four 24 exchanges.</p>
<p>1. Security: 3/5</p>
<p>Since it is an automatic trading service, security is at an average level. This service has not been involved in hacking or fund theft from its users. Like any other automatic bot, it also requires API access.</p>
<p>2. User reviews: 4/5</p>
<p>User reviews are mixed. Many share their success stories of earning with this service, but there are also users who claim to have lost their funds. Some even reported that they couldn't make their subscription profitable using this bot.</p>
<p>3. Functionality: 2/5</p>
<p>This bot supports only four of the most popular exchanges, resulting in high competition among arbitrage traders and users of the service. This makes finding good spreads more challenging.</p>
<p>4. Prices: 2/5</p>
<p>The price for this product is $9 &ndash; $149 for a month, a reasonably acceptable price for what this bot provides.</p>
<p>5. Additional features: 3/5</p>
<p>This service offers additional features available to users:</p>
<ul>
<li>A demo account where you can try out your strategies.</li>
<li>Cloud server (it's not safe)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We have highlighted some arbitrage bots that we believe are the most comprehensive and reflect the cryptocurrency arbitrage market. We recommend trying out ArbitrageScanner, even if you have used other bots that are not in our top list. We believe it is truly a market leader that other services will adapt to.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nowadays, no one manually searches for crypto spreads anymore; everyone uses bots for cryptocurrency arbitrage. There are two types of arbitrage bots: automatic and manual.</p>
What are the differences?
<p>Automatic arbitrage bots are bots where you set limits on spreads, coins, and exchanges. The bots themselves place orders or buy cryptocurrencies. All automatic bots work through APIs. Due to this, the risk of using automatic bots is significantly higher since you are essentially granting access to your funds to a third-party application.</p>
<p>Manual arbitrage bots are bots that provide information on spreads through separate applications, messengers, or even SMS. You still choose the limits, coins, and exchanges.</p>
<p>Today, we will review arbitrage bots and rank them based on the following criteria:</p>
<p>1. Security</p>
<p>2. User reviews</p>
<p>3. Functionality</p>
<p>4. Prices</p>
<p>5. Additional features</p>
<p>We will evaluate each criterion on a 5-point scale and calculate the arithmetic mean to determine the best cryptocurrency arbitrage bot.</p>
ArbitrageScanner
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's start with the first-place bot - ArbitrageScanner with a rating of 4.8.</p>
<p>This service supports 60 CEX exchanges, 40 DEX exchanges, and more than 30 blockchains! The service even supports local exchanges in Turkey, Korea, and Latin America. Let's break down why it is ranked number one for cryptocurrency arbitrage scanning.</p>
<p>1. Security: 5/5</p>
<p>ArbitrageScanner is a manual cryptocurrency arbitrage bot. It sends you notifications about exchange rate differences on Telegram. This bot works without requesting API access, meaning all possible risks associated with your funds are eliminated. All exchanges connected to ArbitrageScanner have been verified and are safe to use.</p>
<p>2. ArbitrageScanner.io reviews: 5/5</p>
<p>We couldn't find any significant negative reviews online. There were a couple of users who were dissatisfied that the service wasn't working, but we verified that the project's official channels mentioned technical work, updates, and expanded functionality. Users' reviews in personal blogs are positive, and reviews from news resources are also positive.</p>
<p>3. Functionality: 5/5</p>
<p>The scanner works with a vast number of CEX, DEX, and blockchains. It is the most accurate scanner based on our measurements, always showing you the current cryptocurrency prices on exchanges. This alone gives it a high rating, but the service's development team has also created a screener for cryptocurrency arbitrage, which we'll discuss further in the Additional Features section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>4. Prices: 4/5</p>
<p>The minimum tariff costs $70, but we recommend paying attention to the Expert tariff at $399. It is ideal for both beginner and expert arbitrage traders. Opting for a more expensive tariff provides increased limits, allowing you to set up 30 different coins simultaneously, 15 different Telegram channels, and more. What caught our attention the most is that this tariff includes free access to the second service we mentioned earlier - the Arbitrage Screener. Additionally, you gain access to an arbitrage trader community, where experienced specialists share successful strategies, insights, and current spreads that can be profitable. The price of $399 doesn't seem too high, especially when you are offered numerous earning opportunities. There is also a free trial available.</p>
<p>5. Additional features: 5/5</p>
<p>Under additional features, we consider what the service offers besides its main product. ArbitrageScanner provides numerous additional functions.</p>
<p>- Closed chat for arbitrage traders, where both the scanner team and the community share cases and hot opportunities.</p>
<p>- Educational materials, providing training on how to use the scanner, real cases, how to find arbitrage opportunities, and how to set up the service.</p>
<p>- Screener: This is the second product available to users with Pro and higher subscriptions. It displays all possible spreads that you set up across different exchanges and coins. This tool complements the scanner perfectly. You configure the screener to find the exchanges and coins with the largest spreads at that moment. Then, you switch to the scanner, set the settings for those exchanges and coins, and it shows you the most current spreads. Perfect for those who want to earn profits!</p>
<p>- The website offers a free profitability calculator for arbitrage. Even if you don't have a subscription yet, you can calculate how much you can earn on arbitrage with a specific cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>- Some users have been given access to beta testing of another product called Telegram Scanner. This tool allows you to search for all mentions of your chosen cryptocurrency or topic in all Telegram chats. It sends all mentions of your keyword to a separate chat, and with a single click, you can respond to the original messages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
3Commas
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In second place, we have 3Commas with a rating of 4.2.</p>
<p>This is one of the most popular automatic bots at the moment, suitable for cryptocurrency arbitrage. However, it has its small downsides:</p>
<p>1. Security: 4/5</p>
<p>While this bot has not been associated with fund theft or hacking, we cannot give it the highest rating. It uses APIs for operation, like all automatic bots, which poses a security threat to your finances.</p>
<p>2. User reviews: 4/5</p>
<p>User reviews are generally good, but there are negative reviews regarding the service's performance. Some users complain about the delayed support response, but we do not consider these to be critical drawbacks of the project.</p>
<p>3. Functionality: 4/5</p>
<p>The service offers automatic arbitrage, but only on a single exchange. Due to the large number of users, it is very difficult to automatically earn profits using this service as there is significant competition among arbitrage traders using the same bot. There is inter-exchange arbitrage available on 16 CEX exchanges, but compared to the number supported by the first-place service in our ranking, this seems very limited. Moreover, 3Commas does not support DEX exchanges, which are now considered the new frontier for arbitrage opportunities.</p>
<p>4. Prices: 5/5</p>
<p>The service offers a 7-day free trial, which is much longer than its competitors. The tariff prices range from $29 to $99, which is quite competitive for the services provided.</p>
<p>5. Additional features: 4/5</p>
<p>This is the most interesting aspect, considering what additional features each product offers. 3Commas provides:</p>
<p>- 5 bots for manual trading and 9 for automatic trading, but most of them are available in the highest subscription.</p>
<p>- A demo account where you can try out your strategies.</p>
<p>- An internal portfolio rebalancer.</p>
Bitsgap
<p></p>
<p>In the third place in our ranking is Bitsgap with a rating of 3.6.</p>
<p>This is an automatic bot that supports 15 CEX exchanges.</p>
<p>1. Security: 4/5</p>
<p>As we mentioned before, automatic bots are not safe to use. Here, we encounter the first confirmation of this statement. Some users reported that funds went missing from their accounts. It could be malicious competition, but we cannot overlook these statements.</p>
<p>2. User reviews: 3/5</p>
<p>User reviews are mixed, with complaints about poor support, delayed bot performance, and some exchanges periodically not functioning. As mentioned before, there are also claims about missing funds. On the other hand, some users did not experience such issues. While we cannot recommend using this bot, we also cannot claim that it is developed by dishonest developers.</p>
<p>3. Functionality: 4/5</p>
<p>The functionality does not stand out among automatic arbitrage bots. It supports 15 CEX exchanges and lacks DEX exchanges. Otherwise, it duplicates or even lacks certain features compared to 3Commas.</p>
<p>4. Prices: 5/5</p>
<p>The minimum tariff is $23, and the maximum is $119. The difference between tariffs is minimal, and in the market, this is a relatively high price for the services provided.</p>
<p>5. Additional features: 2/5</p>
<p>The service offers an arbitrage profitability blog and knowledge base, and unfortunately, that's all the additional functionality it provides.</p>
Coinrule
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fourth place on the list of arbitrage bots is Coinrule with a rating of 3.4.</p>
<p>This is an automatic bot for arbitrage that supports 10 CEX exchanges.</p>
<p>1. Security: 2/5</p>
<p>Once again, this is an automatic bot that uses API. There are also articles about users of this bot losing their funds, but we cannot vouch for the accuracy of this information. It could also be the work of competitors, but we cannot ignore these claims.</p>
<p>2. User reviews: 3/5</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In a groundbreaking move, video game commerce giant Xsolla has teamed up with cryptocurrency platform, Crypto.com.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The integration of Crypto.com's checkout solution into Xsolla's Pay Station platform heralds a new era in the gaming world and is a bold move forward for Crypto.com in its quest to carve a niche in the gaming sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The integration promises to offer game enthusiasts and developers a seamless way to embrace cryptocurrency payments, ensuring smoother transactions and an enriched user experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the digital realm and metaverse grow, the partnership ensures gamers have plenty of payment options at their fingertips. Eric Anziani, the COO of Crypto.com, expressed his enthusiasm, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is significant potential in the convergence of gaming and Web3. By partnering with a global gaming leader like Xsolla and leveraging our respective assets and expertise, we are helping make that potential a reality &ndash; giving developers, publishers, and players a seamless way to engage and create value in the crypto economy.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Xsolla's Pay Station, already a powerhouse facilitating in-game purchases across a vast expanse of over 200 regions, is set to amplify its offerings with the Crypto.com Pay integration. This move is poised to broaden horizons for game developers, allowing them to connect with a diverse audience and explore untapped markets and revenue avenues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chris Hewish, the head honcho at Xsolla, noted:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gaming industry is rapidly evolving, and we must adapt to meet those changes. The integration of cryptocurrencies as a form of payment offers game developers and players an innovative payment solution that aligns with the global shift towards digital currencies. Our collaboration with Crypto.com marks a pivotal moment for the gaming industry, paving the way for a more inclusive and secure gaming ecosystem.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>On a similar note, Patrick Yoon, who oversees Crypto.com's operations in Korea, added:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are tremendously excited to take this first step with Xsolla as part of a broader collaboration initiative in Korea and on a global level. We look forward to continuing to work with Xsolla in developing and advancing payment ecosystems and digital asset adoption.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This joint enterprise between Crypto exchange Crypto.com and global video game commerce company Xsolla offers much potential for further integration of crypto and gaming. The availability of crypto payments for gamers is likely to stimulate both sectors.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Crypto investing app Libertify is calling on retail investors to up their game with the launch of a new offering that provides free, AI-powered risk assessments and instant optimization proposals for their portfolios.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Libertify is the creator of an AI-powered app that uses intelligent algorithms powered by neural networks to recommend portfolio adjustments, with the goal being to optimize user&rsquo;s portfolios and hedge against any risk they might be exposed to. The startup believes it can provide a valuable service to investors, given the notorious volatility of the crypto market and the instability of digital assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With its new offering, Libertify says it will provide a free audit of the user&rsquo;s crypto portfolio, followed by an instant optimization proposal, with recommendations on the adjustments investors should make to hedge against risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The offering works with just about any kind of digital wallet, including software wallets such as Binance, Coinbase and MetaMask, as well as hardware wallets like Ledger, Libertify said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Libertify CEO Steve Rosenblum said last year&rsquo;s crypto winter shows that it&rsquo;s time for investors to learn from the past. The company&rsquo;s portfolio audits provide investors with a unique way to scan risk exposure, he explained. The launch of its offering is well-timed too, as the market for crypto retail investors is growing rapidly. Whereas there were around 200 million crypto investors globally in 2017, that number is expected to rise to more than 1.6 billion by 2025.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an intriguing offering that will enable retail investors to benefit from the same kind of risk management solutions that were previously only available to the biggest banks and financial institutions, Libertify said. Until now, retail investors have always had to rely on their own insights and abilities to analyze the crypto market, but this approach is fraught with danger. As Rosenblum explains, by following their instincts, investors often make irrational choices, increasing the chance of them suffering considerable losses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Libertify&rsquo;s AI-powered recommendations and proposals enable crypto investors to better protect themselves against market volatility, while still holding onto the assets they believe in.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Crypto users buy tokens based on their beliefs and hopes, often forgetting that the crypto market is a turbo of volatility,&rdquo; Rosenblum said. &ldquo;Simple and efficient, our industry-first AI risk management solution brings new hope for all self-directed investors still shocked by the last crypto crisis.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The capabilities of Libertify&rsquo;s app were validated earlier this year when it was announced as the winner of the Paris leg of the Fast Track Hong-Kong FinTech, a prestigious annual contest for fintech and wealthtech startups that provides opportunities to secure funding and mentorships from some of Hong Kong&rsquo;s biggest financial firms. Having won that leg, Libertify will face off against 11 other startups in November&rsquo;s grand finale.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Yield Guild Games surged nearly 600% in less than a week, smashing through the top gainers charts before abruptly crashing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to reports, a new Binance trading product and an ongoing community gaming event have played a pivotal role in the incredible price rally of the YGG token.&nbsp;</p>
YGG Token Surges&nbsp;
<p>According to data from CoinmarketCap, the Yield Guild Games (YGG) token saw a dramatic surge over the past week, rising by 580% and reaching a peak of $0.93 on the 7th of August, 2023. However, the token abruptly crashed soon after reaching this price level and is currently trading at around $0.36. However, the token had hinted at a decline in price in its gradually dropping trading volume. The trading volume recorded a drop of 26% in 24 hours, falling under $500 million, while the market cap increased by $17 million, reaching $161 million.&nbsp;</p>
Why Did The YGG Price Rally?&nbsp;
<p>Observers attributed the surge in the YGG token&rsquo;s price to a couple of major factors. On the 3rd of August, Yield Guild Games announced the 4th season of the Guild Advancement Program (GAP). The Guild Advancement Program is a periodic gaming event that distributes rewards such as tokens to community members who successfully complete specified quests in participating in YGG-affiliated games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 4th season of Yield Guild Games includes some of the biggest names in the space, such as Splinterlands, Skyweaver, and Axie Infinity. As a result, it should come as no surprise that the Yield Guild Games network usage saw a spike, reaching a one-month high of 192 active addresses. Yield Guild Games stated in its press release,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of the community&rsquo;s most recent top picks are joining the fold this season, with all-new quests for guild members to dive into as they hone their skills and establish their web3 reputation. The season will officially begin on the 3rd of August, 2023, and will run until the 27th of September, 2023.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barely a day later, Binance announced plans to launch a YGG/USDT trading pair for perpetual contracts on its CEX platform, allowing up to 20x leverage. Available on-chain data suggests that the announcement brought in about $100 million worth of new capital into the YGG ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
Whales Dumping Share Of YGG
<p>While the growth has been quite notable, reports have emerged of venture capital companies who initially backed the project, reportedly looking to sell their share of YGG on Binance. Data from LookOnChain sourced on the 7th of August shows that Bitkraft Ventures and DWF Labs have moved their YGG holdings to Binance and are most likely looking to sell. DWF Labs had received around 29 million YGG from the Yield Guild Games Treasury. However, on-chain data has suggested that most of these tokens have been moved to exchanges. Bitkraft Ventures also made large deposits on Binance using FalconX.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another whale, Wintermute Trading, has reportedly deposited just over 11 million YGG worth $6.7 million to different exchanges over the past four days. It currently holds a further 2.5 million YGG, valued at around $1.5 million. LookOnChain also showed that Youbi Capital had deposited around 1 million YGG to Binance. The firm currently holds about 11 million YGG. Sfermion has also jumped on board the selling wagon, using FalconX to deposit its YGG tokens on Binance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Large deposits generally signify an investor&rsquo;s willingness to exchange the token for other assets or sell them. This is also true of whales such as the ones mentioned earlier. Smaller investors generally tend to follow larger investors, copying their selling behavior.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Steadefi has become the latest DeFi entity to be hit with an exploit, with the company stating in a tweet on X that all the funds it currently holds are at risk of becoming irrecoverable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recent hacks have taken a toll on the space and have put considerable strain on public trust in DeFi apps.</p>
Details Of The Hack&nbsp;
<p>News of the attack first became public on the 7th of August, when it emerged that the decentralized finance app was hit by an exploit of at least $334,000. While the attack was ongoing, the protocol&rsquo;s development team put out a message on X, stating that the attack had put all funds held on the platform at risk and they could become irrecoverable. As a result, the app&rsquo;s total value locked (TVL) fell off a cliff, according to data from DefiLlama. The team posted a message stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;NOTICE: Steadefi has been exploited, and all funds are currently at risk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The team, while confirming the attack, posted a follow-up message on X and explained how the attack occurred. According to the message, the hacker managed to gain access to the private key of the team&rsquo;s deployer wallet and perform OwnerOnly functions. After gaining access to OwnerOnly functions, the hacker executed several OwnerOnly actions, such as allowing any wallet to borrow funds from lending vaults.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team further stated that the attacker managed to drain all loanable funds. However, it assured users that all collateral held in vaults and not lent out was secure. This is because the app does not contain OwnerOnly functions to remove deposits. This means those users who deposited funds to the app&rsquo;s &ldquo;strategy&rdquo; vaults could withdraw some of their funds.&nbsp;</p>
Farming Contracts Stopped&nbsp;
<p>Meanwhile, the hacker also stopped farming contracts through an OwnerOnly function. This means all users who deposited svTokens or ibTokens to farms are currently unable to withdraw their funds. The post states that the funds are essentially stuck in the app&rsquo;s contracts, with token holders who deposited into the farms left in the lurch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to details currently available, the tokens transferred to the address in question include 130,429 USD Coin, 3.39 BTC, 6184 Avalanche (AVAX), and 15 Wrapped Ether (WETH). Apart from the Wrapped Ether, all other tokens were immediately swapped for WETH. The attacker then bridged 184 WETH to another network via the Synapse Bridge.&nbsp;</p>
Steadefi Attempts To Negotiate With Hackers&nbsp;
<p>The development team also confirmed that it is attempting to negotiate with the hackers and has sent an on-chain message to the hacker&rsquo;s address, 0x9cf71F2ff126B9743319B60d2D873F0E508810dc, on Ethereum. Blockchain data has revealed that the address saw a large number of inflows on the Avalanche Chain. The development team seems to have taken a leaf out of Curve Finance, Metronome, and Alchemix&rsquo;s playbook, offering 10% of the stolen funds as a bounty in return for the remaining 90%. The team also told the hacker that should they return the funds, there would be no involvement of law enforcement agencies or legal actions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Steadefi would like to discuss a bounty with any parties who were involved in the recent Steadefi exploit. We are offering a 10% bounty of any funds stolen, which are yours to keep if you return the remaining 90%.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, like Curve, in a stark warning, the team added that should the hackers refuse the offer, Steadefi would offer the 10% as a bounty to anyone in the public who could identify or supply information that leads to a conviction. Clearly, Steadefi hopes to see the funds return without any further complications. However, the platform is more than willing to fight for the funds should it need to. The offer expires on the 10th of August at 0800 UTC.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will have no risk of us pursuing this further, no risk of law enforcement issues, etc. If you choose not to partake in the voluntary return and complete the process by the 10th of August at 0800 UTC, we will expand the bounty to the public and offer the full 10% to the person who is able to identify you in a way that leads to your conviction in the courts. We will pursue you from all angles with the full extent of the law.&rdquo;</p>

DeFi&rsquo;s Hacker Headache&nbsp;
<p>Crypto and DeFi remain highly vulnerable to bad actors, even as the space looks for wider acceptance. Last month, Coinspaid fell victim to an attack orchestrated by the dreaded Lazarus Group, a North Korean-backed hacker group. An analysis showed how the breach occurred and found multiple vulnerabilities in Coinspaid&rsquo;s security. At the beginning of August, decentralized exchange LeetSwap suspended trading thanks to fears of a potential exploit. Bankrupt crypto platform Voyager also suffered a breach in the middle of its court-supervised recovery process. Another August heist saw a scammer steal around $20 million worth of USDT through a zero transfer phishing attack. However, Tether was quick to respond, freezing the attacker&rsquo;s address and blacklisting them.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Steadefi has become the latest DeFi entity to be hit with an exploit, with the company stating in a tweet on X that all the funds it currently holds are at risk of becoming irrecoverable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recent hacks have taken a toll on the space and have put considerable strain on public trust in DeFi apps.</p>
Details Of The Hack&nbsp;
<p>News of the attack first became public on the 7th of August, when it emerged that the decentralized finance app was hit by an exploit of at least $334,000. While the attack was ongoing, the protocol&rsquo;s development team put out a message on X, stating that the attack had put all funds held on the platform at risk and they could become irrecoverable. As a result, the app&rsquo;s total value locked (TVL) fell off a cliff, according to data from DefiLlama. The team posted a message stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;NOTICE: Steadefi has been exploited, and all funds are currently at risk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The team, while confirming the attack, posted a follow-up message on X and explained how the attack occurred. According to the message, the hacker managed to gain access to the private key of the team&rsquo;s deployer wallet and perform OwnerOnly functions. After gaining access to OwnerOnly functions, the hacker executed several OwnerOnly actions, such as allowing any wallet to borrow funds from lending vaults.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team further stated that the attacker managed to drain all loanable funds. However, it assured users that all collateral held in vaults and not lent out was secure. This is because the app does not contain OwnerOnly functions to remove deposits. This means those users who deposited funds to the app&rsquo;s &ldquo;strategy&rdquo; vaults could withdraw some of their funds.&nbsp;</p>
Farming Contracts Stopped&nbsp;
<p>Meanwhile, the hacker also stopped farming contracts through an OwnerOnly function. This means all users who deposited svTokens or ibTokens to farms are currently unable to withdraw their funds. The post states that the funds are essentially stuck in the app&rsquo;s contracts, with token holders who deposited into the farms left in the lurch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to details currently available, the tokens transferred to the address in question include 130,429 USD Coin, 3.39 BTC, 6184 Avalanche (AVAX), and 15 Wrapped Ether (WETH). Apart from the Wrapped Ether, all other tokens were immediately swapped for WETH. The attacker then bridged 184 WETH to another network via the Synapse Bridge.&nbsp;</p>
Steadefi Attempts To Negotiate With Hackers&nbsp;
<p>The development team also confirmed that it is attempting to negotiate with the hackers and has sent an on-chain message to the hacker&rsquo;s address, 0x9cf71F2ff126B9743319B60d2D873F0E508810dc, on Ethereum. Blockchain data has revealed that the address saw a large number of inflows on the Avalanche Chain. The development team seems to have taken a leaf out of Curve Finance, Metronome, and Alchemix&rsquo;s playbook, offering 10% of the stolen funds as a bounty in return for the remaining 90%. The team also told the hacker that should they return the funds, there would be no involvement of law enforcement agencies or legal actions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Steadefi would like to discuss a bounty with any parties who were involved in the recent Steadefi exploit. We are offering a 10% bounty of any funds stolen, which are yours to keep if you return the remaining 90%.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Cypher Protocol, a decentralized futures exchange operating on the Solana blockchain, disclosed on August 7th that a significant security breach occurred on their platform.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The breach led to an estimated unauthorized transfer of assets valued at around $1 million. Swiftly addressing the event, Cypher Protocol informed its community of followers on X (formerly Twitter) and took immediate action by freezing its associated smart contract.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">A statement from the firm emphasized their responsive action:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"Cypher has experienced a security incident. The smart contract has been frozen. Investigations are ongoing. The team is currently working with individuals and investigating. To the hacker: We are writing to see whether you would be open to speaking with us about any potential next steps."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Data sourced from the Solana blockchain explorer, Solscan, has been invaluable in providing insights into the breach. It appears that the attacker or attackers absconded with a considerable 38,530 Solana (SOL) tokens in addition to $123,184 USD Coin (USDC). In sum, these unauthorized transactions amounted to roughly $1,035,203. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">What has raised eyebrows in the aftermath of the breach was the movement of the alleged funds. Within a short span following the exploit, a sum of 30,000 USDC from the contentious wallet was rerouted to Binance&rsquo;s specific Solana USDC address. The rapidity of these fund movements highlights the speed at which digital assets can change hands, emphasizing the need for robust security measures and real-time monitoring.</p>
Community Response and Calls for Accountability
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The aftermath of the exploit was punctuated by unique, digital-era responses. Members from the cryptocurrency community sent a series of NFTs to the suspected wallet. These weren&rsquo;t typical assets, but they bore messages &ndash; some of which appealed to the hacker's conscience to return the stolen funds. Among the various messages, one read:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"Seriously though, you used Binance and KuCoin to fund and to try and get 30k out. People will find you. Please do the right thing and give the rest back."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">The timing of this security breach was rather inopportune, as it coincided with Cypher Protocol&rsquo;s collaborative mtnDAO hacker house event, which they co-hosted with another Solana protocol, Marginfi. Ensuring clarity and dispelling doubts about their own security, Marginfi swiftly relayed via their Telegram channel that they remained unaffected by the breach and continue to maintain their operational independence from Cypher.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">As of the time of reporting, no Solana-based funds have been detected as transferred to the Ethereum network, leaving the next steps of the alleged hacker unpredictable.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Incidents like these not only impact the entities directly involved but also reverberate throughout the crypto community. They underscore the persistent challenges in the realm of digital security and emphasize the need for continuous improvements in safeguarding digital assets.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Less than a day after PayPal&rsquo;s huge announcement, Ethereum became flooded by imposter tokens trying to ride the hype.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The digital payments and fintech giant announced the official launch of its very own Ethereum-based stablecoin PayPal USD (PYUSD) yesterday August 7. PYUSD is an ERC-20 token which will be pegged to the US dollar at a fixed rate of $1. It will be primarily used as a bridge between fiat currencies and web3, enabling conversion of any of the platform&rsquo;s listed digital assets to and from PYUSD. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The launch has been the result of PayPal&rsquo;s own exploration into stablecoins at least as far back as January 2022 but which was temporarily halted due to regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. The launch might mean that an agreement has been made between regulators and PayPal&rsquo;s stablecoin issuer Paxos. Now, the launch has been received with much fanfare, with the stablecoin finally rolling out to customers &ldquo;in the coming weeks.&rdquo; </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">However, this has not stopped scammers from riding the hype and launching fake PayPal stablecoins; which have since flooded cryptocurrency exchanges such as Uniswap. This was in part due to PayPal and Paxos&rsquo; own failure to include the official token address for PYUSD in their respective announcements. Users were then quick to inform PayPal about the problem. Finally, after more than a day since the PYUSD announcement, Paxos has released the official smart contract for PYUSD and the corresponding token address and GitHub repository. Currently, the max total supply of PYUSD sits at 26.9 million according to etherscan.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The launch of PayPal&rsquo;s own stablecoin could send waves throughout the crypto industry in the United States. The fact that a stablecoin was released could mean that the current hostile environment for crypto in the country might start to somewhat cool down.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Blockchain.com, one of the earlier players and brands in the crypto exchange space, has secured a payments license from Singapore's regulatory body, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This move follows an in-principle approval granted to the platform in the previous year. With this license, Blockchain.com now joins a group of other service providers in the nation, which includes Circle, DBS Vickers, and Revolut.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">MAS's decision to grant Blockchain.com its license signifies the evolving stance of regulatory bodies towards digital currencies and payment platforms. Licenses from entities like MAS are instrumental in validating a platform's adherence to regional financial and operational norms. For an industry often scrutinized for its transparency and security measures, such endorsements can be critical.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">For platforms like Blockchain.com, having an MAS license can offer a level of operational assurance to its user base. Regulatory frameworks ensure platforms maintain a balance between innovation and user security.</p>
Digital Payments and Regulatory Frameworks
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The ascent of digital payments across the globe underscores the need for robust regulatory mechanisms. Regulatory frameworks aim to standardize operations, ensuring that platforms operate within set boundaries, emphasizing security and transparency. In such a dynamic environment, recognized licenses can be pivotal, guiding platforms through compliant operations.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">With this move, Singapore continues to demonstrate its adaptability in the evolving world of digital payments and cryptocurrencies. Singapore has since emerged as a preferred location for crypto-based startups, ranking third after the US and the UK in terms of funding. Such moves reiterate Singapore's growing position in the global crypto narrative.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">To conclude, Blockchain.com's acquisition of the MAS license is a step forward in its operational journey, while also reflecting Singapore's progressive approach towards digital payment platforms and crypto services.</p>
