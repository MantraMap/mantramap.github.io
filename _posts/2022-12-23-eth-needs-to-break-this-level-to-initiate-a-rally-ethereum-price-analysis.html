title: ETH Needs to Break This Level to Initiate a Rally (Ethereum Price Analysis)
tag: CryptoPotato
---

Ethereum’s price has dropped below a significant resistance zone where the 100-day and 50-day moving averages and a recently formed channel’s middle boundary had a stronger confluence. Therefore, a possible uptrend will be possible only if the price exceeds this range. Oppositely, a rejection might trigger another bearish leg. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily [&#8230;]
