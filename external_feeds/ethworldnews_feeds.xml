<ul><li>The United States SEC has filed a motion to freeze the assets of Binance US.&nbsp;</li><li>The securities regulator is seeking a temporary restraining order from the D.C. District Court.</li><li>The SEC is also seeking a show cause order as to why a preliminary injunction should not be granted.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed an emergency motion in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, seeking a temporary restraining order to freeze the assets of Binance US. The filing comes just a day after the securities regulator <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-cz-vigorously-litigate-sec/">sued</a> the American arm of the world’s largest crypto exchange and its founder Changpeng Zhao for operating an unregistered securities exchange and misrepresenting trading controls and oversight, among eleven other charges. </p>



<h2><strong>SEC Asks Court To Issue Show Cause Order To Binance US</strong></h2>



<p>According to the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.256060/gov.uscourts.dcd.256060.4.0.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">filing</a> made with the D.C. District Court, the SEC is seeking an order to freeze the assets of BAM Management and BAM Trading, the entities overseeing Binance and its affiliates. The emergency motion filed by the securities regulator also sought an order to show cause “why a preliminary injunction should not be granted”. The SEC sought six other court orders, including one requiring the sworn accounting of “certain assets” from Binance US. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The SEC respectfully submits that this relief is necessary on an expedited basis to ensure the safety of customer assets and prevent the dissipation of available assets for any judgment, given the Defendants’ years of violative conduct, disregard of the laws of the United States, evasion of regulatory oversight, and open questions about various financial transfers and the custody and control of Customer Assets”</p><cite>SEC’s filing in the D.C. District Court</cite></blockquote>



<p>If granted, the order would give Binance five days to make sure that the entity to have access to the exchange’s customer funds is Binance US. Within 30 days of granting the order, all customer funds would have to be transferred to new wallets. In its initial complaint against the crypto giant, the SEC indicated that it would seek the above-mentioned restraining order.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The financial watchdog said 16 cryptocurrencies count as securities according to documents filed at a federal court.</li><li>Tokens like SOL, MATIC, and ADA were named in lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase alleging violation of U.S. law.</li><li>Chair Gary Gensler told CNBC that there&#8217;s no need for additional digital currencies since the Dollar and other fiat currencies are already digital.</li></ul>



<p>SOL, ADA, MATIC, and several other cryptocurrencies were named unregistered securities in two separate but similar lawsuits filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. </p>



<p>The tokens were <a href="http://chrome-extension//efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.599908/gov.uscourts.nysd.599908.1.0.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="http://chrome-extension//efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.599908/gov.uscourts.nysd.599908.1.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">mentioned</a> in court documents alleging that crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase operated unregistered securities exchanges. In the case of Binance, both the platform and its CEO Changpeng &#8216;CZ&#8217; Zhao were subjects of the allegations. Binance saw nearly $70 million in outflows shortly after and net outflows reached over $1 billion 24 hours later, per blockchain intelligence startup <a href="https://twitter.com/nansen_ai/status/1666145237474095104" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/nansen_ai/status/1666145237474095104" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nansen</a>. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>As of ~5:30pm CET on June 6th, one day after the SEC announced it was filing charges against Binance entities and Binance CEO CZ, net daily outflows from Binance’s on-chain wallets amounted -1.36bn USD or 2.5% of the USD 54bn balance attributed to Binance on-chain.</p><cite>&#8211; <strong>Nansen analysts Aurelie Barthere and Philip Grushyn</strong></cite></blockquote>



<p>Coinbase was <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-sues-coinbase-after-binance/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-sues-coinbase-after-binance/" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused</a> of breaking securities law and offering unregistered assets but its CEO Brian Armstrong was exempt from allegations. </p>



<p>In total, 16 cryptocurrencies &#8211; BNB, BUSD, SOL, ADA, MATIC, FIL, SAND, AXS, MANA, CHZ, FLOW, ICP, NEAR, VGX, DASH, NEXO, ATOM, And COTI &#8211; were classified as unregistered securities. </p>



<p>These tokens boast a combined market cap north of $100 billion at press time. BNB, ADA, SOL, and MATIC each rank in the top 10 cryptocurrencies per CoinMarketCap rankings. While MATIC &#8211; the native asset of Ethereum scaling solution Polygon &#8211; was classified as a security, ETH was not leaving room for speculation as to why. </p>



<h2>SEC Gary Gensler &#8211; US Doesnt Need More Digital Currencies</h2>



<p>Chair Gary Gensler dodged answering &#8220;Yes or No&#8221; when asked by Congress whether ETH counts as security or not. While Gensler&#8217;s clear answer on the matter remains unknown, the commission chair made it clear that the U.S. does not need more digital currencies. </p>



<p>Gensler <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxXdUvMqAc" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxXdUvMqAc" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">questioned</a> the underlying value of &#8220;these crypto tokens&#8221; and argued that American investors already have access to digital currencies in the Dollar. </p>



<p>Chair Gensler added that crypto businesses must come in and register in compliance with existing law issued by Congress to protect U.S. investors. Crypto entities have insisted that the commission does not provide a clear path for businesses that intend on registering. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>2. There is no path to &#8220;come in and register&#8221; &#8211; we tried, repeatedly &#8211; so we don&#8217;t list securities. We reject the vast majority of assets we review.</p><cite><a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1666129111025324035" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1666129111025324035" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">&#8211; Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong after today&#8217;s lawsuit</a></cite></blockquote>

<p>Brian Armstrong took to <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1666129111025324035" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a> to call out the SEC for resorting to litigation instead of guiding his crypto exchange and similar entities toward regulatory compliance by engaging in rulemaking for the broader crypto industry. Armstrong told his followers that his company is proud to represent the industry in court in pursuit of clarity surrounding rules for the crypto space. The Coinbase executive also reminded everyone that the securities regulator had reviewed the company’s business before allowing it to go public in 2021. </p>



<p>Responding to SEC Chair <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/gary-gensler-us-no-more-digital-currency/">Gary Gensler</a>’s call for crypto firms to “come in and register”, Brian Armstrong clarified that there was no path for firms such as his to get registered with the regulator under the current regulatory regime. He also highlighted the contradicting statements made by the SEC and the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) over the difference between a security and a commodity. Armstrong cited the recent events to underscore the need for new legislation from the US Congress to support crypto by putting clear rules in place. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Instead of publishing a clear rule book, the SEC has taken a regulation-by-enforcement approach that is harming America. So if we need to avail ourselves of the courts to get clarity, so be it.”</p><cite>Brian Armstrong, Chief Executive Officer at Coinbase</cite></blockquote>



<p>Speaking on the matter, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal stated that the SEC’s enforcement-only approach in the absence of clear rules for the digital asset industry was hurting America’s economic competitiveness. Grewal added that the lawsuit would not affect the exchange operations and that it will continue to operate as usual. <a href="https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1666126928678469632" rel="nofollow noopener">Tweeting</a> in support of Coinbase, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse called out SEC Chair Gary Gensler for his “laughable pro-innovation stance” on crypto. Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty added that despite what Chair Gensler may purport, the SEC didn’t have the regulatory authority to label tokens as securities. </p>

<ul><li>SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has stated that the United States doesn’t need more digital currency.&nbsp;</li><li>Gensler has alleged that crypto’s business model is built on non-compliance with U.S. securities laws.&nbsp;</li><li>The SEC Chair believes that the US Dollar is the only digital currency the country needs.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Gary Gensler, the man at the helm of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), appeared in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxXdUvMqAc" rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> with CNBC’s Squawk on the Street earlier today to comment on the recent developments in the crypto market, including the two major enforcement actions initiated by his agency against <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-cease-desist-order-sec-lawsuit/">Coinbase</a> and Binance over the past 24 hours. </p>



<h2><strong>Gary Gensler: US Dollar Is The Only Digital Currency We Need</strong></h2>



<p>When asked to comment on the crypto industry’s repeated demands for regulatory clarity, SEC Chair Gary Gensler claimed that clarity had been around for years and that crypto entities operating in the United States have to come into compliance with the country’s securities laws in the interest of investor protection. He added that the crypto trading platforms in the country were commingling several functions including operating as an exchange, hedge fund, market maker, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Speaking on the most recent lawsuit, filed against American crypto giant Coinbase, Gary Gensler pointed out that the crypto exchange offered 16,000 crypto tokens for trading to its customers. Chair Gensler then called into question the utility and use cases of those tokens and their real underlying value.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We don’t need more digital currency. We already have digital currency. It’s called the U.S. dollar. It’s called the euro or it’s called the yen; they’re all digital right now. We already have digital investments.” </p><cite>Gary Gensler, Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission</cite></blockquote>



<p>Gary Gensler alleged that the part of the crypto industry involving incumbents like Coinbase and Binance is built on a business model of non-compliance with United States securities laws. The SEC Chair took particular issue with the commingling of functions that would not be allowed in traditional finance. “The investing public has the benefit of U.S. securities laws. Crypto should be no different,” Chair Gensler added.</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The Bitcoin network is now supported on the Binance NFT marketplace.</li><li>NFTs on Bitcoin are a hot new narrative capturing attention within BTC’s community and the broader crypto market narrative</li><li>Binance announced the feature hours after the U.S. SEC unleashed a lawsuit based on securities violations.</li><li>Coinbase was sued by the SEC alleging similar rule-breaking a day after.</li></ul>



<p>Binance, one of the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/supported-bitcoin-nft-collections-on-binance-566a47f0ad50498cb7fb4bc00a7f4ee2" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/supported-bitcoin-nft-collections-on-binance-566a47f0ad50498cb7fb4bc00a7f4ee2" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">added</a> Bitcoin NFTs to its marketplace, just one day after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against the company. </p>



<p>The crypto exchange&#8217;s NFT marketplace will now support over 25 Bitcoin NFT collections including BTC DeGods, Bitcoin Bandits, Bitcoin Frogs, Bitcoin Pizzas,  and Bitcoin Punks. </p>



<p>NFTs on Bitcoin are a hot new narrative capturing attention within BTC’s community and the broader crypto market narrative. These digital collectibles became possible thanks to the Ordinals Protocol. </p>



<p>Users can leverage Ordinals to embed data like texts and images on the smallest unit of Bitcoin known as Satoshi through a process called &#8220;Inscription&#8221;. Inscriptions have boomed since they first debuted and now number over 1 million, per Dune Analytics data. NFTs on Bitcoin also picked up steam along with BRC-20 hype, a token standard for creating tokens akin to ERC-20 on Ethereum. </p>



<h2>Binance Unfazed By SEC Lawsuit</h2>



<p>Bitcoin NFTs on Binance NFT Marketplace rolled out less than 48 hours after the U.S. Securities and Exchange sued the crypto exchange for <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-cz-vigorously-litigate-sec/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-cz-vigorously-litigate-sec/" rel="noreferrer noopener">operating an unregistered securities exchange</a>. CEO Chanpgeng Zhao or CZ was also sued for commingling funds, a similar accusation levied against FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried. </p>



<p>Binance responded by denying the allegations while chastizing the securities regulators for its misguided refusal to create clear and fair guidance for the nascent digital asset industry. </p>



<p>Similar to Binance, Coinbase was <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-sues-coinbase-after-binance/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-sues-coinbase-after-binance/" rel="noreferrer noopener">sued</a> by the SEC for unregistered securities trading and other securities violations. Indeed, the federal regulator has dropped the hammer on crypto companies in recent months. </p>



<p>The lawsuits also allege that cryptocurrencies like Solana&#8217;s SOL and Polygon&#8217;s MATIC are securities and therefore should fall under the purview of securities laws. Notably, none of the lawsuits against Binance, CZ, or Coinbase claim that ETH is a security. </p>

<p>The legal back and forth between the largest crypto exchange in the United States and the country’s top securities regulator has culminated in the filing of a lawsuit against Coinbase in New York federal court. The SEC has charged the firm for operating as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency. The regulator also charged the crypto exchange for selling unregistered securities through its staking service. In a parallel action, the Alabama Securities Commission has issued a show cause order to Coinbase.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Coinbase Stock Drops 20%</strong></h2>



<p>The Alabama Securities Commission (ASC) has given Coinbase 28 days to show cause why they should not be ordered to cease and desist from selling unregistered securities in the state. The ASC’s latest action is the result of a multi-state task force of ten state securities regulators including California, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, South Carolina, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin. According to a <a href="https://asc.alabama.gov/News/2023%20News/6-6-2023_Coinbase.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> by the ASC, Coinbase has been accused of violating securities law by offering its staking rewards program accounts to the state’s investors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>News of the ASC’s show cause order broke soon after the SEC announced that it had sued Coinbase for operating its crypto-asset trading platform as an unregistered exchange and for failing to register offers and sales of its staking program. As per the SEC’s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-102" rel="nofollow noopener">complaint</a>, the crypto exchange deprived its investors of disclosures and protections that come from registration, exposing them to significant risk. The securities regulator named 13 crypto assets offered on Coinbase as securities, namely SOL, ADA, MATIC, FIL, SAND, AXS, CHZ, FLOW, ICP, NEAR, VGX, DASH, and NEXO.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Coinbase’s alleged failures deprive investors of critical protections, including rulebooks that prevent fraud and manipulation, proper disclosure, safeguards against conflicts of interest, and routine inspection by the SEC.”</p><cite>Gary Gensler, Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission</cite></blockquote>



<p>The SEC’s lawsuit against Coinbase prompted the company’s stock to drop more than 20% in premarket trading. The share price recovered slightly after market open and is currently trading at $48.8. On one hand, the SEC’s lawsuit alleged that Coinbase operated as an unregistered broker since 2019. On the other hand, the U.S. government has used the crypto exchange to sell billions worth of BTC since 2019. The company’s Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal is set to <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-testify-congressional-committee/">testify</a> before the U.S. House Committee on Agriculture later today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>&#8220;Coinbase has never registered with the SEC&#8221; as a securities exchange, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed in its lawsuit against America&#8217;s biggest crypto exchange.</li><li>The SEC again listed several crypto tokens like SOL and MATIC as securities in the 101-page document filed in New York&#8217;s Southern District.</li><li>Both Coinbase and Binance have now been sued by the SEC for operating an unlicensed securities exchange on U.S. soil.</li></ul>



<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="http://chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.599908/gov.uscourts.nysd.599908.1.0.pdf" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.599908/gov.uscourts.nysd.599908.1.0.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">alleges</a> that Coinbase operates an unregistered securities exchange, brokerage service, and clearing agency. Gary Gensler&#8217;s SEC announced the lawsuit against Coinbase a day after suing industry competitor Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao for similar violations. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The Coinbase Platform merges three functions that are typically separated in traditional securities markets—those of brokers, exchanges, and clearing agencies. Yet, Coinbase has never registered with the SEC as a broker, national securities exchange, or clearing agency.</p></blockquote>



<h2>SEC Strikes Again</h2>



<p>According to the SEC, Coinbase generated billions in revenue while evading the disclosure regime overseeing the U.S. securities market. Similar to its suit against crypto exchange Binance, the SEC lists several tokens as unregistered crypto securities available for trading on Coinbase. </p>



<p>The Commission listed 13 tokens in today&#8217;s lawsuit with no mention of ETH, the same as the Binance lawsuit, although the court document states that the security label is not limited to the tokens mentioned. </p>



<p>The SEC named SOL, ADA, MATIC, FIL, SAND, AXS, CHZ, FLOW, ICP, NEAR, VGX, DASH, and NEXO in court documents. Violations tied to staking services offered by the publicly listed crypto exchange were filed 101-page document as well.</p>

<p>Crypto prices slumped further following the SEC&#8217;s double-barrel enforcement action against crypto&#8217;s largest centralized exchanges. COIN dropped 15% during pre-trading hours on the back of the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Coinbase’s alleged failures deprive investors of critical protections, including rulebooks that prevent fraud and manipulation, proper disclosure, safeguards against conflicts of interest, and routine inspection by the SEC.</p><cite>&#8211; SEC Chair Gary Gensler On Coinbase Lawsuit</cite></blockquote>



<p>The San Francisco-based crypto exchange received a &#8220;show cause order&#8221; from 10 state securities regulators. This means the company has 28 days to convince state regulators not to serve a &#8220;cease and desist&#8221; order for unregistered securities sales.  The multi-state action includes securities regulators from Alabama, California, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, South Carolina, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.</p>



<h2>First Binance, Now Coinbase</h2>



<p>Today&#8217;s lawsuit comes hours after Binance was <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-cz-vigorously-litigate-sec/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-cz-vigorously-litigate-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused </a>of similar violations. In Binance&#8217;s case, its CEO Changpeng Zhao was also sued. The SEC claimed Binance commingled corporate and client cash in a U.S. entity wholly controlled by CZ.</p>



<p>&#8220;We intend to defend our platform vigorously,&#8221; Binance responded. CEO Zhao tweeted &#8220;4&#8221;, his popular code for FUD. </p>



<p>Binance&#8217;s response echoed rhetoric from Brian Armstrong and his company arguing that the SEC would rather regulate the nascent industry through blunt misguided enforcement action than <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/08/coinbase-ceo-on-us-crypto-regulation-sec-lawsuit-international-plans.html" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/08/coinbase-ceo-on-us-crypto-regulation-sec-lawsuit-international-plans.html" rel="noreferrer noopener">engage</a> stakeholders toward developing fair guidance for crypto assets. </p>

<p>Paul Grewal, the Chief Legal Officer at Coinbase Global Inc. is set to testify before the United States House Committee on Agriculture later today. As the legal chief for the largest crypto exchange in the United States, Grewal will emphasize the need for clear regulations for the crypto industry. The lawyer will also underscore the importance of the Digital Asset Market Structure discussion draft, which was <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/u-s-lawmakers-regulatory-crypto-bill/">introduced</a> by House Republicans last week. </p>



<h2><strong>Coinbase: Proposed Bill Needed For Balanced Crypto Regulations</strong></h2>



<p>Paul Grewal took to Twitter recently to inform his followers about his upcoming appearance on Capitol Hill. The Coinbase executive also shared a <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/we-need-clear-rules-for-crypto-to-protect-american-leadership-and-consumers" rel="nofollow noopener">summary</a> of the testimony that he plans to deliver before the Congressional committee. Grewal stated that he will use the opportunity to present his company’s views on the Digital Asset Market Structure Discussion Draft, which was unveiled by House Agriculture Committee Chairman G.T. Thompson and Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry last week. </p>



<p>Grewal stated that his testimony would revolve around three key topics: The U.S. falling behind due to a lack of clear regulations leading to the departure of crypto innovation, Crypto is solving real-world problems, and a clear path is needed in order to protect responsible innovation, and that the Digital Asset Market Structure bill is a strong step towards regulatory clarity for the crypto industry.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Coinbase believes the Digital Asset Market Structure Discussion Draft is a good first step in developing a workable and balanced regulatory regime designed for crypto.” </p><cite>Paul Grewal, Chief Legal Officer at Coinbase</cite></blockquote>



<p>Paul Grewal plans to highlight the developments made in the European Union, the UK, Singapore, and China (through Hong Kong) in terms of crypto regulation, translating to a potential threat to the United States&#8217; economic future and national security. The Coinbase executive will also highlight how the Discussion Draft will benefit and protect the over 20% of Americans that own and use crypto assets.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>The judge overseeing Genesis Global’s bankruptcy case has extended its mediation period.&nbsp;</li><li>FTX’s request to join the court-appointed mediation talks has been denied by bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane.&nbsp;</li><li>Arguments on FTX’s $3.9 billion claim, which was previously denied by the bankrupt crypto lender, will be heard next week.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>In a major victory for Genesis Global Holdco, the judge overseeing its bankruptcy case has granted its request for an extension of the court-appointed mediation process. The bankrupt crypto lender’s confidential mediation sessions, which were attended by its parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG) and creditors, including the Winklevoss-owned crypto exchange Gemini, have been extended in order for the parties to come up with a revised plan to pay its creditors.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Genesis Judge Denies FTX’s Request To Join Mediation Talk</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-05/genesis-judge-rejects-ftx-demand-to-join-crypto-bankruptcy-talks" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane has allotted more time for Genesis to come up with a payout plan along with some of its biggest creditors including Gemini. The outcome of this court-appointed mediation period, which has been extended to June 16, 2023, would form the basis of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan that would dictate the repayment to the bankrupt crypto lender’s creditors. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>There will be a certain amount of radio silence because mediation needs that to work. Shortening the mediation does not shorten the case.” </p><cite>Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane</cite></blockquote>



<p>Judge Lane further ruled that FTX, which claims to be Genesis’ largest unsecured creditor with a whopping $3.9 billion in outstanding claims, cannot join the <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-object-to-genesis-mediation-extension/">mediation process</a> which began last month. Genesis previously estimated FTX’s multi-billion dollar claim at zero and asked the judge to set up a months-long process to recalculate the value of FTX’s claims. The bankruptcy judge will deliver a ruling in this matter at a hearing scheduled for next week. </p>



<p>The bankrupt crypto lender also owes more than $1.1 billion to Gemini’s Earn Users. Genesis’ request for an extension of the mediation period drew opposition from some of the Earn Users last week. However, Gemini assured its customers that an extension of the mediation period would not cause any delay.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>A judicial panel has ordered the consolidation of the lawsuits against FTX’s financial backers and celebrity promoters.&nbsp;</li><li>A multi-district litigation has been created before a U.S. District Judge in Miami, the bankrupt exchange’s former headquarters.&nbsp;</li><li>The latest decision came after the plaintiffs requested the creation of a multi-district litigation last month.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>In a small victory to FTX’s victims, the numerous lawsuits against the Bahamas-based bankrupt crypto exchange’s investors and promoters have been consolidated before a single federal judge in Florida, United States. The consolidation came after a judicial panel ordered the creation of a multi-district litigation, something that the plaintiffs had requested last month during a hearing in Philadelphia.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Multi-District Litigation Against FTX Can Reduce Costs, Fast Track Resolution</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/ftx-s-celebrity-vc-backers-to-face-consolidated-suits-in-miami-1.1929093" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, a judicial panel ordered the consolidation of the lawsuits against FTX’s financial backers and celebrity endorsers before U.S. District Judge Michael Moore in Miami earlier today. The judicial panel picked Miami for the multi-district litigation, given that it served as the crypto exchange’s headquarters before it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November last year. </p>



<p>The numerous lawsuits and class-actions filed against venture capital and private equity firms, including Sequoia Capital and Thoma Bravo have been consolidated. These firms were sued by <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/met-museum-new-york-return-ftx-donations/">FTX</a> customers for enabling co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried by investing in his crypto venture. The multi-district litigation also includes the lawsuits filed against the bankrupt crypto exchange’s celebrity promoters, including NFL star Tom Brady, NBA Hall of Famer Shaquille O’Neal, and Shark Tank host Kevin O’Leary. While FTX has been protected from litigation since it filed for Chapter 11 in Delaware, the protection doesn’t extend to third parties that allegedly enabled the exchange’s activities. </p>



<p>The multi-district litigation is expected to reduce costs associated with the legal proceedings by eliminating duplicative pre-trial document exchanges and providing a venue for test trials to weigh the value of claims. The MDL was requested by lawyers representing the plaintiffs during a hearing last month. The lawyers argued that the sheer amount of lawsuits against FTX-affiliated parties had made the litigation “unwieldy.”. </p>
