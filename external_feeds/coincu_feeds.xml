<p>The decision was made in the midst of a national security investigation into Binance. Th<strong>e US that Voyager is attempting to accelerate</strong>.</p>



<p>Judge Michael Wiles permitted Voyager to sign the asset acquisition agreement and request creditor approval on January 10 in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, but the sale won&#8217;t be complete until a subsequent court hearing, according to a Jan. 11 ReutersÂ <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/voyager-seeks-expedite-national-security-review-binance-deal-2023-01-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>.</p>



<p>It happens when Voyager is trying to hasten the review of its request to sell assets to Binance. US, which can cause the agreement to be delayed or blocked.</p>



<p>During the court hearing, <strong>Voyager&#8217;s attorney Joshua Sussberg stated that the company has been responding to inquiries from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS)</strong> and will address any issues the committee may have that could lead it to oppose the deal.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We are coordinating with Binance and their attorneys to not only deal with that inquiry, but to voluntarily submit an application to move this process along,&#8221; Sussberg said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>CFIUS is an interagency organization that assesses foreign investments in or acquisitions of American businesses for potential threats to national security.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">CFIUS finds that the transaction raises legitimate national security concerns</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Voyager-And-Binance.US-Acquisition-Received-Preliminary-Approval-Amidst-National-Security-Investigation-1.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="419" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Voyager-And-Binance.US-Acquisition-Received-Preliminary-Approval-Amidst-National-Security-Investigation-1.jpeg" alt="Voyager Digital And Binance.US Acquisition Received Preliminary Approval Amidst National Security Investigation" class="wp-image-159405" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Voyager-And-Binance.US-Acquisition-Received-Preliminary-Approval-Amidst-National-Security-Investigation-1.jpeg 800w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Voyager-And-Binance.US-Acquisition-Received-Preliminary-Approval-Amidst-National-Security-Investigation-1-300x157.jpeg 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Voyager-And-Binance.US-Acquisition-Received-Preliminary-Approval-Amidst-National-Security-Investigation-1-768x402.jpeg 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Voyager-And-Binance.US-Acquisition-Received-Preliminary-Approval-Amidst-National-Security-Investigation-1-750x393.jpeg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" title="Voyager Digital And Binance.US Acquisition Received Preliminary Approval Amidst National Security Investigation 3"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>If CFIUS finds that the transaction raises legitimate national security concerns, it may prohibit or reverse the transaction or order the parties to make changes to allay the concerns.</p>



<p>On December 30, CFIUS notified the court that <strong>&#8220;one or more transactions anticipated&#8221; </strong>by Voyager may be the subject of a review, which might lead to delays or blockages.</p>



<p>The U.S. attorney&#8217;s office is apparently looking into Binance&#8217;s global operation amid allegations of money laundering, but Changpeng &#8220;CZ&#8221; Zhao, the CEO, has denied any wrongdoing. <strong>US has its main office in California and bills itself as &#8220;totally independent.</strong>&#8220;</p>



<p>Zhao is a Chinese-born citizen of Canada, and CFIUS is empowered to examine any transactions that potentially give a foreign person equity interest in or control over a U.S. company.</p>



<p>The <strong>Voyager Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors</strong>, which represents creditors without security interests in Voyager, supported the deal in its current form, pointing out that it would yield more significant recoveries for creditors than if Voyager liquidated its holdings itself, as would happen if CFIUS rejects the deal.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">5/ There will not be a single substantial transfer of crypto from Voyager to <a href="https://t.co/5sjac1H4CW" target="_blank">https://t.co/5sjac1H4CW</a> on the closing date that would be at risk in a <a href="https://t.co/5sjac1H4CW" target="_blank">https://t.co/5sjac1H4CW</a> insolvency.</p>&mdash; Voyager Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors (@VoyagerUCC) <a href="https://twitter.com/VoyagerUCC/status/1612824160610156546?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January 10, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The bankrupt lender had already refuted <strong>Jan. 8 objections to the acquisition proposal from Alameda Research, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), four US states, and the US trustee.</strong></p>



<p>It stated that the deal serves the interests of its creditors to the greatest extent possible and that the objections &#8220;fail to put up any factual or legal evidence&#8221; for their claims. Voyager announced their agreement with Binance on December 19.</p>



<p>US&#8217;s offer to purchase its assets in the $1.022 billion transaction following the prior $1.4 billion agreement with FTX. After the collapse of the crypto exchange, the US failed.</p>

<p>It is known that the relationship between the two founders of DCG and Gemini broke down after Genesis announced to stop withdrawing money in November 2022. This locked the funds belonging to investors in the Earning product and Gemini&#8217;s money, leaving Gemini struggling to find a way to get its customers&#8217; money back.</p>



<p>Currently, <strong>Gemini Earn program has also stopped working</strong>, and <strong>Gemini&#8217;s side has issued a request to return all locked assets</strong> to Gemini.</p>



<p>In the body of the letter, DCG CEO Barry Silbert introduced more details about Genesis Capital&#8217;s lending division in a letter to investors. He noted that <strong>DCG has laid off employees and closed its crypto asset management headquarters.</strong></p>



<p>He also asserted that <strong>funds had never been mixed between DCG subsidiaries</strong> and that its relationship with <strong>Three Arrows Capital was limited to a loan and transaction agreement</strong>, which the company further invested in some products of Grayscale.</p>

<p>During the Q&amp;A session, Silbert addressed the controversy surrounding Genesis and its client Gemini. He said DCG borrowed from Genesis Capital, but <strong>&#8220;these loans are made on a free basis and are priced at prevailing market rates.&#8221;</strong></p>



<p><strong>DCG and Genesis Capital have a $1.1 billion promissory note maturing in 2032</strong>, and DCG currently owes Genesis $447.5 million and 4,550 bitcoins, worth about $78 million.</p>



<p>Regarding DCG&#8217;s role in the restructuring of Genesis Capital, Silbert said that due to the debts and promissory notes that DCG owes Genesis Capital, DCG executives, including those on the Genesis board of directors, <strong>do not have decision-making power regarding the restructuring of Genesis Capital.</strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Because of the outstanding loans and the promissory note that DCG owes to Genesis Capital, DCG executives, including those on the Genesis board, have no decision-making authority related to any restructuring of Genesis Capital.&#8221;</p>
<cite>He said.</cite></blockquote>

<p>Starting on Tuesday, users can only create vaults for the <a href="https://news.coincu.com/152104-curve-finance-be-integrating-with-zksync-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Curve Finance</a> liquidity tokens, a stablecoin exchange program. These vaults will employ <strong>veCRV</strong>, a Curve time-locked token that enables users to significantly increase their yield benefits.</p>

<p>The permissionless vaults are a component of a larger V3 strategy, which seeks to completely decentralize the user-facing services and products provided by Yearn in the future.</p>



<p>Users have only been able to access vaults made by the project developers and contributors thus far. Anyone can now develop their own strategies and market them on Yearn, where other interested users can deposit their own tokens and receive dividends, thanks to the advent of the permissionless vault factory.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://cryptofees.info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">data</a>, over <strong>$100,000 in fees</strong> were earned on Curve in the last 24 hours and distributed to users and liquidity providers.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Over time, this might expand Yearn&#8217;s user base and draw additional liquidity to the well-liked DeFi application. When Yearn charges a fraction of the rewards as fees for its yield-aggregation service, it generates revenue based on customer liquidity.</p>



<p>Last October, <strong>yearn.finance</strong> <a href="https://news.coincu.com/131900-yearnfinance-launches-vaults-on-optimism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that it launched opportunities for Yearn vaults on <strong>Optimism</strong>, which provides farming for some vaults such as DAI, WBTC, WETH, USDC, and <strong>sUSD</strong>. Furthermore, with strategies that farm on several <strong>DeFi</strong> mainstays like <strong>Aave, Velo, Uniswap, Curve, Stargate</strong>, and <strong>Ironbank</strong> &#8211; Optimism fans may now receive the same Yearn unbreakable risk management framework with increased earnings.</p>

<p><strong>Jamie Dimon</strong>, CEO of JPMorgan, referred to Bitcoin as a &#8220;<strong>decentralized Ponzi scheme</strong>&#8221; when speaking at the<strong> 41st Annual Healthcare Conference</strong> hosted by JP Morgan.</p>



<p><strong>In 2017</strong>, he stated that <a href="https://news.coincu.com/159187-bitcoin-on-track-for-a-major-breakout-2023/">Bitcoin</a> was <strong>a well-known &#8220;scam&#8221;</strong> and that any <strong>JPMorgan trader who was</strong> <strong>caught trading BTC would be sacked immediately</strong>. After that, Dimon became somewhat more open-minded, even going so far as to say that he thinks the blockchain technology has some potential.</p>



<p>Despite its CEO&#8217;s aversion to cryptocurrencies, the JPMorgan Group has shown <strong>interest in blockchain technology on multiple occasions</strong>. Dimon was unwavering in his opposition to bitcoin. According to Dimon,<strong> bitcoin is a speculative &#8220;asset&#8221;</strong> that will never be able to replace fiat currency or develop into an effective payment system.</p>

<p>He stated that cryptocurrencies are frequently used for <strong>unethical endeavors </strong>and pointed to the fact that the majority of people own them as<strong> investment vehicles due to the volatility of their pricing</strong> rather than to purchase goods and services. He said that this is because cryptocurrencies are decentralized and anyone can create their own cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>Although Dimon is not<strong> as caustic in his criticism of cryptocurrencies</strong> as he was <strong>in 2017</strong>, he continues to consider them as<strong> hazardous speculative instruments</strong> that have no real value. This is despite the fact that he was less severe in his criticism of cryptocurrencies in 2017.</p>



<p><strong>In October</strong>, Dimon criticized Bitcoin by calling it<strong> &#8220;dirty&#8221; and &#8220;expensive,</strong>&#8221; expressing his distaste of the cryptocurrency. <strong>In Decembe</strong>r, he explained the cryptocurrency by comparing it to little rocks that you keep as pets.</p>

<p><strong>Armstrong</strong> <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/a-message-from-ceo-and-co-founder-brian-armstrong-to-coinbase-employees" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commented</a> after assessing the company&#8217;s chances for 2023:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;As we examined our 2023 scenarios, it became clear that we would need to reduce expenses to increase our chances of doing well in every scenario. While it is always painful to part ways with our fellow colleagues, there was no way to reduce our expenses significantly enough, without considering changes to headcount.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to its <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001679788/2f0eb2cd-0f3c-4a4c-a23a-e715caf96394.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8K filing</a>, the exchange projects that the restructuring costs associated with these actions will amount to <strong>between $149 million and $163 million</strong>. Of this, monetary charges for employee severance and other termination payments will total <strong>between $58 and $68 milli</strong>on. The cost of stock-based compensation for the layoffs will range<strong> from $91 million to $95 million</strong>.</p>

<p>In the first quarter of this year, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/158089-coinbase-pays-100-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a> expenditures anticipate recognizing these costs. <strong>Armstrong</strong> cautioned there is a possibility of more spread following the impact of dishonest actors in the cryptocurrency market.</p>

<p>The name &#8220;<strong>The Rock</strong>&#8221; is<strong> recognized all over the world</strong> as a result of the films &#8220;Fast and Furious&#8221; and &#8220;Jumanji.&#8221; Wahlberg&#8217;s participation in high-grossing films such as &#8220;The Departed&#8221; and &#8220;The Fighter&#8221; <strong>has not yet been confirmed to work with Gala</strong>.</p>

On the other hand, the corporation has made it clear that <strong>&#8220;everything is good</strong>&#8221; and that all tokens on Ethereum, in addition to <strong>GALA-related assets on the bridge</strong>, are secure. The coin&#8217;s valuation has suffered as a result of the rumor, <strong>falling by as much as 90%</strong> across a number of cryptocurrency platforms in the span of just a few days.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>e-Money, a cosmos-based electronic payment system, has halted issuing its EEUR stablecoin, citing market conditions.</em></li>



<li><em>Up to March 6, the platform will accept EEUR stablecoin redemptions.</em></li>



<li><em>Customers with less than 100,000 EEUR in their accounts can close out their positions by exchanging their tokens in Osmosis, the biggest decentralized exchange on Cosmos, directly in the stablecoin market.</em></li>

<p>According to a <a href="https://medium.com/e-money-com/eeur-stablecoin-unwind-cf945820fb3f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Medium post</a>, the Cosmos ecosystem stablecoin project<strong> e-Money</strong> will stop issuing its <strong>EURR</strong> stablecoin on <strong>March</strong> <strong>6</strong>. The decision to end the stablecoin project was challenging, e-Money wrote in its explanation of choice:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;e-Money had hoped to continue the success of its EEUR stablecoin in 2022, but the crypto industry faced many challenges in 2022, with both centralized and decentralized entities experiencing difficulties. While e-Money was not directly affected, the stablecoin business relies heavily on integration with traditional finance, and financial institutionsâ interest in cryptocurrency has waned following the events of 2022. As a result, the tumultuous events of 2022 have made it challenging for e-Money to integrate with traditional finance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Up to <strong>March 6</strong>, the platform will accept <strong>EEUR</strong> stablecoin redemptions. Customers with less than <strong>100,000 EEUR</strong> in their accounts can close out their positions by exchanging their tokens in <a href="https://news.coincu.com/150247-osmosis-has-launched-stableswap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Osmosis</a>, the biggest decentralized exchange on Cosmos, directly in the stablecoin market. </p>



<p>They can trade their tokens for <strong>USDC</strong> or native assets of Cosmos, like <strong>ATOM</strong> and <strong>OSMO</strong>. Users were encouraged by e-Money to close down their positions gradually to lessen market volatility and price slippage.</p>

<p>Customers can redeem amounts more than <strong>100,000 EEUR</strong> immediately for euros, according to the notice. The process will take up to<strong> five business days</strong> for these users to pass customer identification checks.</p>



<p>Even if the <strong>EEUR</strong> stablecoin was terminated,<strong> </strong>the platform insisted <strong>that its blockchain project would still be active</strong>. Within the first quarter of the year, the project intends to improve its chain and incorporate the newest Cosmos features.</p>



<p>Smaller batch sales are encouraged by the project to lessen market effects and slippage. Markets will continue to trade close to the reference price thanks to market-making efforts conducted by <strong>e-Money</strong>.</p>
