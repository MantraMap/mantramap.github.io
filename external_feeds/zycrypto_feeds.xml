<p>Binance maintained hockey-like growth since 2021 despite the crypto market downturn, according to on-chain data provider Cryptoquant. Sharing its findings on Tuesday, Jan 10, the firm noted that the exchange’s annual revenue topped around $12 billion in 2022, growing ten times over the past two years.</p>



<p>Binance’s revenue growth comes amid a daunting crypto winter that has sent crypto prices to record lows. Since Bitcoin topped $68,000 in November 2021, the global crypto market capitalization has folded by over half, putting various crypto exchanges under immense pressure to reduce spending through <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-continues-staff-layoffs-citing-ongoing-market-conditions/">job cuts</a>.</p>



<p>And although Binance continued to maintain that it was business as usual, the exchange’s trading volumes also started to fall towards the end of 2022, tapping a two-month low of $9.39 billion on Dec 23 and lowering its estimated quarterly revenue.</p>



<p>According to a December report by Glassnode, Binance experienced an outflow of 90,000 Bitcoin in a week. On Jan 9, Forbes reported that the exchange saw $12 billion worth of crypto assets withdrawn in the past two months, citing a report availed to it by a reliable source. </p>



<h2 id="h-binance-outdoes-crypto-winter"><strong>Binance Outdoes Crypto Winter</strong></h2>



<p>Binance has had a robust company culture which explains its growth against the odds. Aside from becoming the first exchange to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-publishes-proof-of-reserves-system-for-btc-more-assets-to-follow/">provide proof-of-reserves</a> following the FTX debacle, Binance focused on building new products and trading functionalities to attract more users. </p>



<p>The exchange has also ramped up efforts to become regularly compliant across various jurisdictions. As of Dec 31, 2022, Binance had secured registrations and Licences in 14 jurisdictions globally. It also reinforced its commitment to fight against bad actors in the space, increasing its security and compliance headcount by over 500%.</p>



<p>In January last year, the exchange became the first crypto exchange to join the National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance (NCFTA). Earlier this month, it joined the Association of Certified Sanctions Specialists (ACSS) as it seeks to strengthen its sanctions compliance procedures.</p>



<p>Binance has also received <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/markets/a-long-history-of-doing-right-by-the-customer-market-research-firms-weigh-in-on-binances-solvency-and-market-standing-8979050151649648422">positive rankings</a> by leading crypto analytics firms, further strengthening its public image. Last month, Cryptoquant verified the exchange&#8217;s proof of reserves, concluding that the structure of its holdings was robust, with no signs of dangerous “FTX-like” behaviour.</p>



<p>Further, Norway-based, digital asset-native research firm Arcane research noted, “in terms of trading activity, Binance is the crypto market,” in its year-in-review report, attributing the exchange’s strong growth to user-friendly policies such as lifting trading fees for BTC spot pairs and sound employment policies.</p>



<p>In his end-of-2022 report, Changpeng Zhao “CZ” insisted that the exchange would continue building, putting users first, and “leading by our own example”. According to him, “the next bull market will come from innovation in the ways these products are used to create unique utility.”</p>

<p>The crypto community has had to bear one of the coldest crypto winters in the sector’s history this past year. However, nothing has been as chilling to them as the unexplained deaths of some wealthy crypto holders.</p>



<p>Interestingly, the death of 4 crypto billionaires towards the end of 2022, all in less than a month, has left the crypto community scratching their heads and sparked fierce rumours of crypto-related conspiracies.</p>



<p>On October 29, young crypto pioneer Nikolai Mushegian was found dead on a Puerto Rican beach just hours after tweeting that intelligence agencies CIA and Mossad were after him. However, his family noted that the 29-year-old had been battling mental health issues and that there was no foul play.</p>



<p>Then on November 22, Javier Biosca, the man at the centre of Spain’s biggest probe into cryptocurrency fraud, was found dead in Estepona. Biosca, who until his death had been staying with his wife and son at a retreat in the Costa del Sol town, is said to have fallen to his death after he went out onto the terrace.</p>



<p>The next day, Nov 23, Tiantian Kullander, founder of Hong Kong-based crypto company Amber Group died mysteriously in his sleep aged 30. Although no previous dark dealings could be traced to the tech guru, crypto pages and pop-up sites were inundated with questions around the sudden death, with the most searched topics being “what disease did Tiantian have?” and “Tiantian cause of death”.</p>



<p>Two days later, on November 25, Russian crypto billionaire and Libertex crypto exchange head Vyacheslav Taran died in a helicopter crash. While the cause of death was not ruled out, Ukrainian authorities linked the mysterious crash to Kremlin’s foreign intelligence, claiming that Taran was responsible for laundering cash from Russia via crypto operations. On the other hand, Russian media reported that an identified VIP who was expected to join Taran cancelled his flight at the last minute.</p>



<p>The four deaths have sparked a fierce debate within crypto-twitter, with some convinced that a triangle of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/terras-do-kwon-apologizes-to-luna-victims-insists-he-is-not-on-the-run/">disgruntled customers</a> who lost their funds “unfairly” using the deceased’s firms was out to get revenge.</p>



<p>“<em>That&#8217;s what happens when you steal from someone that can&#8217;t forget,”</em> one user wrote.</p>



<p>Another user linked the death spiral with the “central banking hierarchy, sarcastically writing, “<em>I would definitely not put money on it being connected to the central banking hierarchy. There is no way. They are very trustworthy. 100% no chance.”</em></p>



<p>On Reddit, some users were convinced that some of those deaths <a href="https://zycrypto.com/eccentric-crypto-rebel-john-mcafee-faked-his-death-ex-lover-shockingly-reveals/">were faked</a> to enable the crypto heads to start over a fresh life. </p>



<p><em>“I wonder how many of these are people faking their own deaths,”</em> one user asked.</p>

<p>Binance has been granted registration to operate in Sweden, expanding its foothold in Europe.</p>



<p><em>“Binance is pleased to announce that Binance Nordics AB has been granted registration as a financial institution for management and trading in virtual currency by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (Swedish FSA),”</em> the exchange announced today.  </p>



<p>The exchange noted that the greenlight came after a month of constructive engagement between Swedish regulators and Binance Nordics AB. This means that going forwards, Swedish nationals will have access to all of Binance&#8217;s crypto products and services, including crypto buy/sell through Euros, Binance Visa Card, Binance NFT, auto invest and custody, among others.</p>



<p>Sweden now becomes the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/france-plans-to-become-the-european-hub-of-the-crypto-ecosystem-but-theres-a-catch/">seventh EU member state</a> to grant Binance an operating license after France, Italy, Spain, Cyprus, Lithuania, and Poland issued it with similar authorizations within the past two years. Furthermore, following today’s announcement, Binance now boasts 15 operating licenses and registrations globally.</p>



<p>Commenting on the new milestone, Richard Teng, head of Europe and MENA at Binance, wrote;</p>



<p><em>“Binance continues to demonstrate its commitment to work closely with regulatory agencies to uphold global standards. Our registration in Sweden is the result of many months of diligent, hard work from our team, underpinning our commitment to the Swedish market and our users. We are deeply grateful for the support from the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority throughout the application process and for the approval.”</em></p>



<p>On a separate note, Roy van Krimpen, Nordics and Benelux Lead, stated that Binance Nordics AB had “adopted risk and AML policies to match EU laws and local laws by Sweden. “<em>Our next big task will be the successful migration and launch of local operations, including hiring of local talent, organizing more events and delivering more crypto education in Sweden,”</em> he added.</p>



<p>Binance expansion into Europe has been a big win for the world’s largest crypto exchange by traded volume, especially considering the headwinds it faced, particularly after the Terra Luna crash. In June 2021, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued a circular stating that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/uk-financial-watchdog-clamps-down-on-worlds-largest-crypto-exchange-binance/">Binance was unregulated</a>, hence could not conduct any activities in the country.</p>



<p>In July 2021, the crypto exchange was forced to temporarily halt payments from the European Union’s Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) as well as U.K.’s Faster Payments network citing events beyond its control. Earlier in the same month, Barclays said that it was blocking deposits to the exchange, although withdrawals were allowed. </p>



<p>Yet, despite the cold reception, Binance has continued to push into the EU region, with Martin Bruncko, Binance’s Executive Vice President for Europe, <a href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2022/06/22/binance-is-in-it-for-the-long-game-when-it-comes-to-europe-and-doesnt-fear-the-crypto-cras">noting</a> that they are “in it for the long term” when it comes to Europe.</p>

<ul>
<li>New court filing reveals troubled FTX splurged $40 million on luxury meals and flights before its collapse.</li>



<li>A large chunk of the sum was spent on hotels, with one raking in $5.8 million within a nine-month period.</li>



<li>FTX’s bankruptcy filing has opened up a can of worms from which industry members are still reeling.</li>
</ul>



<p>A deep dive into FTX’s expenses nine months preceding the exchange’s collapse reveals a wild pattern of frivolous expenses that disappointed creditors.</p>



<p>As the bankruptcy proceedings against FTX drags on, a new filing has unmasked the nature of spending embarked upon by the exchange. The filings show that the embattled exchange blew over $40 million between January and September 2020 before succumbing to liquidity issues.</p>



<p>The filing disclosed that the company spent 5.8 million dollars at the luxury Albany Hotel in the Bahamas while 3.6 million and $800,000 were spent at the Grand Hyatt and Rosewood resort respectively. In total, FTX high-level employees spent nearly $15 million on accommodation in five-star hotels around the world.</p>



<p>Meals were a major expenditure for FTX in the nine-month period under review, with the filing showing that over $3 million were paid to catering services. Other forms of entertainment caused FTX a small fortune, while a staggering $4 million was spent on flights.</p>



<p>Another source of spending for the company was donations to local charities in the Bahamas. It is unclear how much the company donated to local aid groups in the small island nation, but pundits believe the bulk of donations will be returned as the Bahamian government tries to absolve itself of any <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ftxs-sam-bankman-fried-accepts-extradition-to-the-us-after-deadlock/">wrongdoing</a>.</p>



<p>The Financial Times reports that the Sam Bankman-Fried company struck a deal with an airline to deliver employees’ Amazon purchases to the Bahamas in record time.</p>



<p>Former employees have described FTX’s profligate spending as “<a href="https://zycrypto.com/ftxs-sbf-bags-250-million-bail-could-face-up-to-100-years-in-jail-as-close-associates-plead-guilty/">cult-like</a>” and “moronically inefficient”.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-large-can-of-worms"><strong>A large can of worms</strong></h2>



<p>Caroline Ellison, a former top-level executive at Alameda Research, told the court that she collaborated with Bankman-Fried to “conceal” the extent of the firm&#8217;s loans and borrowing to investors. Ellison confirmed in her plea hearing Bankman-Fried and other top executives received loans running into billions of dollars.</p>



<p>FTX co-founder Gary Wang pled guilty to charges, saying that he was part of a plot to give Alameda Research “special privileges” by tweaking FTX’s code without disclosing the move to investors of the exchange.</p>

<p>Cardano (ADA), the 8th most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization, experienced a colossal price spike in the first week of January 2023. The move is auspicious for ADA, especially as many altcoins are still nursing losses carried over from 2022.</p>



<h2 id="h-ada-whale-addresses-are-to-be-credited-mostly-for-the-price-swing"><strong>ADA whale addresses are to be credited mostly for the price swing</strong></h2>



<p>The price upswing is linked to a notable force in the market: <a href="https://zycrypto.com/even-as-whales-offload-ada-cardano-could-see-huge-price-boost-if-this-happens/">ADA whales</a>. Popular cryptocurrency market intelligence platform Santiment reported that barbel backtracks from sellers had been spotted.</p>



<p>It appears that ADA holders had dumped over half a million worth of ADA tokens within November and December of 2022, only to return to holding a notable size of the dumped coins.</p>



<p><em>“Cardano is enjoying a mini-surge at this hour, and addresses holding between 1M to 100M $ADA may be a main validator to watch for a price breakout. After dumping 568.4M coins the final 2 months of 2022, they have added back 217.2M $ADA to start 2023.” Santiment noted in a recent tweet.</em></p>



<p>While there’s no known factor fueling this backpedalling, investor behaviour, as highlighted by a previous report from Santiment, gives insight into what might be happening.</p>



<p>Apparently, investors holding between 10,000 and 1,000,000 ADA&nbsp; were imitating behaviours exhibited by investors during the 2019 bear market by accumulating assets.</p>



<p>This pattern took a pause within the last periods of 2021 when ADA’s price tapped $1.3 and turned into “net sellers” of ADA, up until ADA’s price was at $0.33 and dipped even lower within the last two months of 2022.</p>



<p>Santiment explains why investors might have taken the route they took and hints at the possibility of their return to the market by accumulation, a pattern which now seems to be unfolding.</p>



<p><em>“This suggests that these investors may be cautious about the potential of ADA and have been selling off their holdings. It will be interesting to see if these investors decide to start accumulating aggressively again in the future.” Santiment explained.</em></p>



<p>It is worth noting that many market players have collectively predicted that the cryptocurrency market is likely to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/global-recession-will-push-bitcoin-price-to-remarkable-highs-in-2023-bloomberg-analysts/">record an upsurge</a> in adoption. This is due to the expected economic recession that the United States is expected to experience this year.</p>



<p>As such, market players might be increasing their holdings in assets like ADA to hedge against inflation. However, whether that is the sieving factor behind ADA’s current accumulation by whales is not certain.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, at the time of this report, ADA is trading at $0.32. ADA’s performance in 2023 at this time is quite impressive. The asset is up over 29% within the last seven days and has recorded a favourable price increase every day since the 29th of December last year.</p>

<ul>
<li>Crypto payments platform Wyre sets a new withdrawal policy allowing users to withdraw only 90% of their assets.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The policy will include limits to specific assets, including a daily cap of 5 BTC, 50 ETH, and 20,000 USDC withdrawals. </li>



<li>Amidst growing concerns of bankruptcy, Wyre management expresses commitment to weather the storm.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>The crypto winter has stretched longer than predicted by many experts and has made several web3 firms think outside the box to stay afloat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digital asset payment platform Wyre has announced a new withdrawal policy in the wake of bankruptcy concerns hovering around the company. The new policy will allow users to withdraw up to 90% of their funds subject to their present daily limits. </p>



<p>The Francisco-based firm has <a href="https://twitter.com/sendwyre/status/1611774171050299392?s=21&amp;t=rGuB5tnGZGjAQr2ypXQlKQ">stated</a> that it is exploring strategic options to navigate the present bear market and it is in the <em>“best interest of the community.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>“We are modifying our withdrawal policy. While customers will continue to be able to withdraw their funds, at this time, we are limiting withdrawals to no more than 90% of the funds currently in each customer account, subject to current daily limits,” </em>the company shared via Twitter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new policy also restricts daily withdrawals of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and fiat.  According to their website, there will be a limit of up to 5 BTC, 50 ETH, and 20,000 in DAI and USDC, while daily fiat withdrawals will be $150,000 and £140,000. </p>



<p>The company restated its commitment to simplify and expand global digital asset payments, adding that it will continue to “<em>explore strategic options” </em>to survive current market conditions. The announcement of withdrawal limits sparked panic within crypto spaces however some believe that the firm will weather the storm. </p>



<h2 id="h-wyre-s-issues-run-deep">Wyre’s issues run deep&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The new company withdrawal policy comes amidst bankruptcy rumours and other operational issues. Last week, MetaMask made a shocking <a href="https://twitter.com/metamask/status/1611112520944701440?s=21&amp;t=SIG4AZVVwYwe3wFZdwbiEg">announcement</a> removing Wyre from its mobile aggregate which allows users to buy virtual assets via its extension. </p>



<p>The firm&#8217;s bankruptcy travails came to the fore last month by allegations by two former employees. The company denied the allegation stating that it will “<em>scale back” </em>to plan new strategies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wyre has also carried out a management shakeup with Stephen Cheng elevated to the CEO whilst assuring that the company’s operations will continue and the community will be updated with new developments.</p>

<p>Coinbase announced Tuesday that it plans to lay off 950 staff members, about 20% of its workforce, to reduce costs &#8211; according to an internal memo. The exchange is blaming the current market conditions for its continued personnel reduction.</p>



<p>In June last year, Coinbase announced another layoff of a fifth of its employees. Besides, its CEO Brian Armstrong is attributing the move to the macroeconomic factors that played a role in last year’s market downturn.</p>



<p>‘‘<em>In 2022, the crypto market trended downwards along with the broader macroeconomy. We also saw the fallout from unscrupulous actors in the industry (referring to the collapse of the crypto derivatives exchange FTX). There could still be further contagion</em>,’’ Armstrong said in a coverage by CNBC.</p>



<h2 id="h-coinbase-joins-amazon-meta-and-salesforce-in-layoff-trends"><strong>Coinbase Joins Amazon, Meta, and Salesforce in Layoff Trends</strong></h2>



<p>Coinbase is not the only company cutting headcount amid the bear run. Amazon, Meta, and Salesforce have equally downsized, saying they hired more staff during the heightened activity before the pandemic. Coinbase announced that the layoff could reduce up to a quarter of its overhead costs, with the overall cost averaging $170 million, including sendoff packages for the retrenched personnel.</p>



<p>The exchange, publicly listed on Nasdaq under ticker COIN, added that it expected to adjust EBITDA losses for the year to within the $500 million benchmark set in 2021.</p>



<p>Coinbase’s announcement comes as the industry continues to battle the contagion around the collapse of FTX and the bankruptcies filed by notable industry players, including BlockFi and crypto miner Core Scientific. According to Armstrong, the exchange is also planning to close down projects with a lower probability of success. The executive is less optimistic about the future but believes tightening regulations could sanitize the space.</p>



<p>‘‘<em>The FTX collapse and the resulting contagion has created a black eye for the industry</em>,’’ he said. ‘‘<em>We may not have seen the last of it – there will be increased scrutiny on various companies in the space to ensure that they follow the rules. Long term, that is a good thing, But short term, there is still a lot of market fear,</em>’’ Brian commented.</p>



<p>Cryptocurrencies are currently showing a slight recovery following a market plunge last year. Bitcoin is up 4% in the past week, while Ethereum has gained more than 10% in the same period.</p>

<p>Bitcoin bulls managed to shake off December’s dust, decisively pushing past $17,000 for the first time in over three weeks. The world’s most traded cryptocurrency was trading at $17,348, up over 2.41% in the past 24 hours.</p>



<p>Ethereum led in gains surging by over 4.55% in the same period to trade at $1,330 Monday noon. Other cryptocurrencies in the top 15 groups by market capitalization also gained steam, led by Solana and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ada-leads-weekend-gains-as-cardano-eyes-super-bullish-milestones-for-2023-bitcoin-ether-little-changed/">Cardano</a>, up over 22% and 13%. Dogecoin, BNB and MATIC followed quietly, adding over 8%, 7% and 3.20% overnight. Overall, the global crypto market cap increased by 3.49% to tap&nbsp;$855.83B, according to data from CoinMarketCap.</p>



<p>Bitcoin’s surprising rebound comes after Friday’s positive nonfarm payment rolls data. While this data suggests an imbalance between labour supply and demand still exists, investors viewed cooling wages as a sign the Fed may slow its rate-hiking ambitions. Moreover, with the US inflation expected to remain stable in the coming week, economists have been pencilling in a 25 basis-point increase in the Fed’s benchmark rate, with some FED officials suggesting that a half-point hike is possible.</p>



<p>Fed’s monetary tightening is a big factor in Bitcoin’s price movement, contributing significantly to the cryptocurrency’s 64% decline last year. Observers have thus argued that the top crypto benefits immensely from the FED easing its monetary policy.</p>



<p>On January 4, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) announced that hedge funds significantly reduced their Bitcoin short positions “across the board” towards the end of 2022. Bitcoin futures open interest decreased by 1,086 from 14,124 on December 27 to 13,038 on January 4. This rate of decline suggests that investors should keep an eye on the conversion movement with long bets.</p>



<p>Confidence in the crypto sector has also been rekindling as authorities continue <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-feds-launch-ftx-task-force-to-trace-and-recover-stolen-investor-funds/">to crack down</a> on FTX officials and other rogue actors worldwide-suggesting regulations may soon follow. According to John Reed Stark, Former Chief of SEC’s Office of Internet Enforcement, the trend is likely to continue, bringing back crypto’s shine and allure.</p>



<p>Onchain, Bitcoin’s sentiment indicator, has turned neutral, with exchange signals tilting to extremely bullishness, according to data from the crypto analytics platform IntoTheBlock. 53% of BTC holders are also depicted as making money at the moment, with only 37% being in the loss.</p>



<p>While there is still room for <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-price-could-get-as-low-as-9000-asserts-pundit-who-correctly-predicted-btcs-top/">Bitcoin to plummet</a>, traders expect the price to mount a mini rally towards the $18,200 resistance. According to Cryptoquant’s “Greatest_Trader”, “<em>the end of the current bear market won’t be expected unless the price surpasses the realized price, currently at $19.7K.”</em></p>

<p>For most crypto firms, 2023 continues right from 2022, following the collapse of former crypto king Sam Bankman-Fried’s empire in November. In the past three months, layoffs in the sector have hit an all-time high as crypto prices drop to record lows.</p>



<p>However, of most concern has been the rate at which major crypto lending firms have been declaring bankruptcy, with most of them tracing back connections to FTX or Alameda research. Gemini, a US-based crypto exchange, is now on the brink of facing a similar situation.</p>



<h2 id="h-gemini-s-uncertain-future"><strong>Gemini’s Uncertain Future</strong></h2>



<p>In the past week, the exchange has come under the spotlight for its huge crypto holdings trapped in Genesis, which has had liquidity issues since the FTX collapse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gemini users have been unable to withdraw about $900M from the exchanges Earn program after the platform suspended the program due to Genesis halting withdrawals on November 16. Launched in February 2021, Gemini Earn is a service that promises interest payments of up to 7.4% APY compounded daily on cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>Apart from facing a string of user lawsuits, the Winklevoss twins-helmed crypto exchange has been trying to get Genesis to release the $900M to no avail. On Jan 2, Cameroon Winklevoss penned an open letter to Barry Silbert (CEO of Digital Currency Group, the parent company of Genesis), <a href="https://zycrypto.com/gemini-accuses-dcg-of-being-behind-genesis-woes/">accusing him</a> of “engaging in bad faith stall tactic” aimed at delaying negotiations to resolve the Genesis-Gemini situation. However, Barry denied the allegations, shifting the blame to Gemini, who failed to respond to a proposal on December 29th.</p>



<h2><strong>All Quiet on The Western Front</strong></h2>



<p>Despite facing a huge setback regarding the Earn, Gemini seems to have continued procession exchange user withdrawals without trouble. However, crypto analytics platform Cryptoquant has pointed out some glaring disparities suggesting that all may not be well with the New York-based exchange.</p>



<p>In a Jan 6 report, Cryptoquant revealed that Gemini “is experiencing declining exchange activity” on virtually all fronts. According to the firm,  cryptocurrency reserves for BTC, ETH, and stablecoins have dropped significantly. BTC deposits from other exchanges and trading volume have slumped to record lows, a sign that users are trying to avoid the exchange. </p>



<p><em>“These trends were exacerbated around the time Genesis paused withdrawals,”</em> wrote Cryptoquant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Onchain data, however, depicts Gemini as an institution-oriented exchange which could be the main reason it has been able to hold up. Institutions are generally depicted as long-term investors and hence have the appetite for holding through market storms retail investors. Last June, the exchange cut about 10% of its workforce, citing unfavourable market conditions, which could also help it cut on spending in the current crypto winter.</p>



<p>While it is unclear how long turbulent market conditions are likely to persist, it will be interesting to see how Gemini will come out of its current situation even as other crypto firms continue to fold.</p>

<p>Bitcoin’s <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-traders-hold-their-breath-as-the-new-year-opens-heres-whats-going-on-in-bitcoins-ecosystem/">turbulent performance</a> in 2022 hasn’t deterred big players from predicting a promising run for the asset in 2023. Bloomberg is one such platform with a bullish outlook on Bitcoin and presents notable reasons why the asset is poised to see rapid growth in the new year.</p>



<h2 id="h-bloomberg-cites-the-global-recession-as-a-bullish-propeller-for-bitcoin"><strong>Bloomberg cites the global recession as a bullish propeller for Bitcoin</strong></h2>



<p>In its most recent cryptocurrency outlook, Bloomberg analysts go over the impact of the perceived global recession on Bitcoin and other digital currencies in the market.</p>



<p><em>“The rising potential for a severe global economic shutdown may be a top crypto performance factor in 2023. Our bias is that Bitcoin is most likely to come out ahead in most scenarios…” Bloomberg explains.</em></p>



<p>It is worth noting that many other notable voices share Bloomberg’s views in the cryptocurrency industry. As 2022 came to a close and predictions for the new year rolled in, many prominent traders and investors mirrored this bullish sentiment.</p>



<p>The founder of Altana Digital Currency Fund, Alistair Milne, is one such figure. Milne called $45,000 for Bitcoin, given that inflation favours the asset.</p>



<p>Pointing to the inverted yield curve, which shows long-term interest rates are less than short-term interest rates, being a possible indicator, the report says that economic growth will ebb and result in implications for all assets.</p>



<p>Bitcoin could return to $12,000 or go even lower to $10,000 as a result. This would mean that the asset, which trades at $17,353 at press time, could shed anywhere from $4,490 or $6,940 of its current price. Nonetheless, it is still bound to make an upward comeback, the report maintained.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="647" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1-1024x647.png" alt="" class="wp-image-77025" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1-1024x647.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1-300x190.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1-1536x971.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1-2048x1294.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTCUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>It was also noted that another case scenario that might play out differently from last year is the Federal Reserve and central banks being forced to start “easing back on deflationary forces from declining asset prices.”</p>



<p>If this becomes the case, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-price-could-get-as-low-as-9000-asserts-pundit-who-correctly-predicted-btcs-top/">Bitcoin</a> could also follow another positive pathway.</p>



<p><em>“In this Fed pivot scenario, Bitcoin is poised to transition to a digital version of gold and perform like the metal and US treasury long bonds. A swift recovery in declining GDP and asset prices appear less likely.” </em>Bloomberg conclusively asserts.</p>

<p>Bitcoin and Ether traded without much fanfare Friday as the top crypto’s volatility continued its rapid decline. At press time, Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market volume, was trading at $16,983 after a 0.23% uptick in the past 24 hours.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Ether was exchanging hands at $1,272 after a 0.71% increase in the same period, according to CoinMarketCap data. Notably, the two cryptos continued to hold within a narrow range they have occupied since mid-December.</p>



<p>Other cryptos on the top-ten list of non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies continued to lose ground, with XRP, Dogecoin and MATIC plunging 2.90%, 3.78% and 2.77%, respectively, in the past day. The global cryptocurrency market capitalization increased by 0.74% to $830B, while the total crypto market volume dropped by 14.05%&nbsp;to $27.35B.</p>



<h2 id="h-cardano-leads-in-gains"><strong>Cardano Leads in Gains</strong></h2>



<p>Cardano managed to shake off the weakness, surging by 5.66% in the past 24 hours to trade at $0.29 at press time. In the past seven days, ADA, the native token for the Cardano proof-of-stake blockchain, has grown by over 18%, making it the largest gainer among the top ten cryptos.</p>



<p>ADA’s growth has been attributed to a range of key factors, including the user trust that goes with the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/charles-hoskinson-to-test-cardanos-new-wallet-with-1000000-worth-of-ada-experiment/">consistent growth</a> of its ecosystem. Earlier this week, Cardano dApps completed 16 million transactions hitting a new milestone. On January 4, crypto payments giant processor CoinGate noted in a report that ADA entered the top ten most used cryptos list for the first time in 2022.</p>



<p>Large investors also seem to be helping buoy ADA prices as the token’s current prices offer attractive discounts. Crypto market intelligence platform Santiment Feed attributed ADA’s end-of-week mini-surge to aggressive buying by addresses holding between 1M to 100M ADA.</p>



<p>According to the firm, this group of investors have added back 217.2M ADA since Jan 1 2023, despite dumping 568.4M coins in the final two months of 2022. As per the firm, this cohort “may be a main validator to watch for a price breakout”, potentially sending the price back to $0.30.</p>

<h2><strong>FTX Contagion Continues To Shake Markets.</strong></h2>



<p>Although the crypto market seems to have priced in the events of the last two or so months, the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-feds-launch-ftx-task-force-to-trace-and-recover-stolen-investor-funds/">FTX contagion</a> continues to unravel, suppressing crypto prices further. Crypto bank&nbsp;Silvergate Capital became the latest casualty announcing on Thursday it was cutting 40%&nbsp;of its staff after facing US$8.1 billion in withdrawals sparked by the FTX failure in November.</p>



<p>Genesis Global Trading, one of the leading lenders in the industry, also reportedly cut its headcount by 305 and is considering filing for bankruptcy, according to a report by Wall Street Journal, which cited people familiar with the matter. On Friday, Digital Currency Group, the parent company of Genesis Global Trading, announced it is shutting down a wealth-management division called HQ due to, among other reasons, a “prolonged crypto winter.”</p>

<ul>
<li>Fidelity files three trademark applications, delving into the metaverse with huge plans. </li>



<li>The firm leverages key areas like virtual real estate investments, NFT trading, and marketplace services. </li>



<li>Fidelity’s belief in digital assets has not wavered even after the implosion of FTX, with the firm poised to create more impact in the sector. </li>
</ul>



<p>Investment giant Fidelity is set to make inroads in the metaverse as its latest efforts in the development of web3 to the delight of metaverse users.</p>



<p>The firm filed three trademark applications in the United States covering a host of web3 products and services including, virtual real estate investments, cryptocurrency trading, and NFT marketplaces, among others. The investment giant&#8217;s latest move has kept users gleeful as they await the offerings in the metaverse. </p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks">filings</a>, the company is also looking at investment services for mutual and retirement funds in the metaverse. Another area is the provision of educational services and multiple conferences in digital reality platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>conducting classes, workshops, seminars, and conferences in the field of investments and in the field of marketing financial services in the metaverse and other virtual worlds,” </em>read the filing.</p>



<p>A metaverse electronic payment will also be rolled out as the filing states, “<em>financial administration of credit card accounts in the metaverse and other virtual worlds.” </em></p>



<p>Digital asset trading services in the metaverse will incorporate NFTs, cryptocurrencies, and electronic wallet services alongside a financial management advisory service in virtual real estate and referral services.</p>



<p><em>“Electronic wallet services in the nature of electronic storage and processing of virtual currency for electronic payments and transactions via a global computer network; digital currency, virtual currency, cryptocurrency digital token.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<h2 id="h-fidelity-s-digital-asset-drive">Fidelity’s digital asset drive&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Fidelity Investment’s push in cryptocurrencies this year has been nothing short of excellent despite the heavy criticisms by some lawmakers on its recent crypto offerings and the market downturn. In April, the firm announced plans to offer companies and their employees access to Bitcoin (BTC) in their 401(k) retirement accounts. </p>



<p>The investment company also launched Fidelity Crypto, a service that allows retail investors to trade Ethereum (ETH)  and BTC at zero fees from their phones. In October, the company increased its digital asset division by hiring 100 employees instead of other top firms laying off staff.</p>

<p>Bitcoin continued to trend range bound on Saturday, riling investors who had to contend with lacklustre price volatility in the past 14 months. At press time, the top cryptocurrency was trading at $16,966 after a 1.11% increase in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. Its biggest rival, Ethereum, also traded sluggishly at $1263- a level it has been toying at for the past two days.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="647" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1024x647.png" alt="" class="wp-image-77010" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1024x647.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-300x190.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1536x971.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-2048x1294.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTCUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Unlike the past year, where a clique of high net-worth investors like <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-bull-tim-draper-sticks-to-250000-price-prediction-for-btc-in-2023/">Tim Draper</a> and Ark Invest CEO Cathie woods made extremely optimistic calls for Bitcoin, it has increasingly become harder for investors to predict where crypto prices may be going as 2023 unravels. However, some sceptics are convinced that Bitcoin will plunge lower before the curve can flatten out in the coming days.</p>



<p>For instance, Gareth Soloway, the chief market strategist of InTheMoneyStocks, believes there is more room for Bitcoin to the downside. Speaking to Kitco News earlier yesterday, the pundit who correctly predicted Bitcoin’s 2021 top, noted that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/pundit-who-predicted-bitcoins-plunge-to-20k-lowers-bet-to-12000/">Bitcoin could plunge</a> to $9,000. </p>



<p><em>“I’m still looking at eventually $12,000 to $13,000 in a short-term target. I do believe it will go lower than that and pierce $10,000 and could go as low as $9,000 before all this is over.”</em> Soloway told Kitco’s, David Lin.</p>



<p>According to him, the Bitcoin chart was in the process of forming a “bear flag pattern” which, if validated, could see its price drop to the said level. He, however, stated that BTC was likely to see a minor rally in the near term.</p>



<p><em>“All we have to do is take out $17,000, and I actually think we are going to get a short-term rally to about $18,400. So actually, I’m very short-term bullish, but you can’t ignore the bigger pattern here, which is still bearish.”</em></p>



<p>Soloway’s predictions come even as the FTX debacle hammers the markets. In the past two months, firms linked to Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire have been folding, crushing investors’ risk appetite. To Soloway, however, whereas “there is still some flushing to do”, there was no doubt that all this was getting closer to ending.</p>



<p><em>“We are also getting close to potential regulation, which I think will be a huge asset for bitcoin and crypto as that will be an avenue for big money to start dabbling in crypto again,”</em> he went on. </p>



<p>Previously, Soloway has called for <a href="https://zycrypto.com/analyst-gareth-soloway-reveals-probable-trigger-for-bitcoins-ascent-to-500000/">Bitcoin at $500,000</a> in the long term as clear regulations for the crypto sector are passed, and adoption picks up. Since tapping an all-time high of $68,789 in November 2021, Bitcoin’s price has fallen over 75%, making it the fourth largest wipe-out of all time in the asset’s history.</p>

<p>MicroStrategy, the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin reserves, has continued to splash cash towards BTC purchases ignoring cynics and the industry’s chaos created by the stunning collapse of FTX.</p>



<h2 id="h-microstrategy-buys-more-btc"><strong>MicroStrategy Buys More BTC</strong></h2>



<p>In a Dec 28 filing with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), the business intelligence company disclosed it had purchased 2,395 bitcoins for approximately $43 million between Nov 1, 2022, and Dec 21, 2022.</p>



<p>More interestingly, it revealed that it sold 704 BTC on Dec 22 to help it take advantage of the various US tax benefits given bitcoin’s vanished value since it first started acquiring the cryptocurrency in 2020. Notably, it later bought back 810 bitcoins at $16,845 per coin on Dec 24.</p>



<p>The latest purchase now brings MicroStrategy’s holdings to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/crypto-community-fears-centralization-as-microstrategys-bitcoin-holdings-hit-132500-btc/">approximately 132,500 BTC</a> acquired at a total cost of around $4.03 billion and an average purchase price of approximately $30,397 a coin.</p>



<h2><strong>Crypto Community Puzzled At BTC Purchases</strong></h2>



<p>Whereas calls to purchase BTC at current discounted prices have been rising among crypto users, not everyone is stoked by MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy.</p>



<p>In the wee hours on Saturday, Michael Saylor, the company’s founder and former CEO, shared a Bitcoin performance chart from 2020, tweeting;</p>



<p><em>“The Bitcoin Strategy is winning for MicroStrategy.”</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/tuOaasGcaPbzNpJ5f5j-QtThyQUNHB5b046QcKY2YFmfzFzNzTifDt6KiBMW6OMnwvZdcHcyIAYC-gjnm3-zZNW52sg-jCp5XMy5fF40ZQ_MPYlqIPLyTLQxytH2NmaQodAzl83dQxqh0fQnEE1XvWLak_j23CJfd1vOqNkavQUB70bCxEN0mP3tH3DHw5yG4HEA4ygMJg" alt="C:\Users\Newton\Downloads\Fl0vsS3WYAM85fc.png"/></figure>



<p>The tweet, which has since garnered close to a million views, has received mixed reactions, with most comments suggesting most crypto adherents have lost hope in his bitcoin acquisition strategy.</p>



<p><em>“Microstrategy Bitcoin holdings are down 45%, which is almost the worst performer here. This chart assumes he went all in on Bitcoin at the date provided. In reality, he&#8217;s just been averaging in as everything crashes which defeats the point of this graphic,”</em> Fellow trader Nebraskan Gooner commented on the chart. </p>



<p><em>“$MSTR is down 90% from the high, has over 1 billion unrealized loss on the bitcoin, and has over $700 million debt to get those BTC. If that&#8217;s winning to you then I don&#8217;t want to know what losing means to you,”</em> another wrote.</p>



<p>With Bitcoin trading at around $16,966 at press time, MicroStrategy’s stash would now be worth just over $2.24 Billion, translating to an unrealized loss of about $1.79 billion.</p>



<p>Moreover, apart from debts owed to creditors for the purchase of Bitcoin, shares of MicroStrategy have continued to tumble, dropping nearly 50% following the FTX debacle.</p>



<p>Despite the downturn, MicroStrategy, which turned to bitcoin in 2020 as a hedge against inflation, remains unwavering, with Michael Saylor stressing that they <a href="https://zycrypto.com/microstrategy-reiterates-it-has-a-long-term-focus-on-bitcoin-despite-a-harrowing-year/">will never sell</a> their Bitcoin. Saylor, who has previously revealed he owns 17,732 bitcoins, believes that the world most traded cryptocurrency is “unstoppable” and that, ultimately “, Bitcoin is the separation of money and state”.</p>
