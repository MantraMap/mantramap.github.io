<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/uk-crypto-companies-job-market/">UK Crypto Companies Recruiting despite Sharp Decline in Job Market</a></p>
<p>The job market in the UK is suffering a sharp decline. The experts believe the crisis has been caused not only by the general economic recession but also by a shortage of talent on the market. According to the report by the Broadbean Technology firm, a fall in the number of open positions is accompanied by a 30% decline in the number of applicants. The shortage of staff is extremely sharp in engineering, science, architecture, hospitality and catering, as well as health services.</p>
<p>Alex Fourlis, Managing Director at Broadbean Technology, <a href="https://www.thelondoneconomic.com/jobs/uk-talent-crisis-worsens-as-job-applications-fall-in-skill-short-industries-353211/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">explained</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Although the market is slowing down, the skills crisis is far from over. The UK simply doesn’t have enough of the highly trained and highly skilled professionals it needs to fill the demand. It’s imperative that employers stay focused on the skills agenda and continue to invest in talent attraction and development if they are to grow their competitive standing.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>He further added:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The lack of candidates isn’t going to be solved overnight and is already a big issue for firms. Those that can get in front of the right people quickly, and via the right channels, will be the ones in a prime position to win the war for talent.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>As per the UK Office for National Statistics, the UK unemployment rate was estimated at 4.0% for the second quarter of this year, which is 0.2% higher than the previous quarter. Reed Recruitment has <a href="https://www.reed.co.uk/recruiter-advice/job-market-review-may-2023/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> a 24.40% fall in the number of advertised positions over the past three months in comparison to the previous year. Notably, the number of available jobs is below the pre-pandemic era.</p>
<h2>UK Crypto Companies Posting New Job Offers</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, crypto companies located in the UK are publishing new job offers and actively <a href="https://beincrypto.com/uk-jobs-drop-crypto-companies-hiring/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">looking for employees</a>.</p>
<p>For example, the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/gemini/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gemini</a> exchange is looking for a Compliance Associate at its UK office. <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase Inc</a> (NASDAQ: COIN) is hiring the Head of Mobile Business Development and International Policy Manager.</p>
<p>Further, Ripple is seeking Employment and Litigation Counsel to provide strategic legal advice and counseling globally on a broad range of employment law matters. The company is also in need of an Executive Assistant based in London. Recently, it won a court ruling in the US against the Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>).</p>
<p>Following the victory, the company applied for registration as a crypto asset firm with the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority and for a payment institution license in Ireland. Now, Ripple is definitely planning to expand its footprint in the UK. Over the past 18 months, Ripple has increased its UK and European employees count by about 75%, with over 100 of its approximately 900 global employees based in its offices in London, Dublin, and Reykjavik, Iceland.</p>
<p>Crypto trading company <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/robinhood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robinhood Markets Inc</a> (NASDAQ: HOOD) is also moving forward with plans to launch in the United Kingdom. As we have <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/robinhood-uk-branch-us-regulatory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>, the company has appointed former Barclays director Jordan Sinclair as its UK arm&#8217;s CEO. Among the jobs posted by Robinhood on LinkedIn are a senior risk and compliance associate, a compliance officer, and an operations lead, all based in London.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ripple-corpay-netting-manager/">Ripple&#8217;s Partner Corpay Introduces Internal Invoicing Tool – Netting Manager</a></p>
<p>Corpay, a global leader in business payments and partner of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ripple-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ripple Labs Inc</a>, has launched a new tool designed to make the process of internal invoice settling automated and streamlined. Called Netting Manager, the service targets corporations that have subsidiaries across the globe.</p>
<h2>Netting Manager Invoicing Tool</h2>
<p>Among the issues that Netting Manager aims to address are lack of transparency due to lack of centralization, payment date uncertainty, and unnecessary FX conversion and transaction costs.</p>
<p>Corpay Vice President of Currency Risk Analytics Jim Kessler said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It’s simple, and that’s what is great about it. We developed Netting Manager with the intention that it would be easy to use. Many of the current netting solutions on the market are complex and require extensive onboarding, which results in higher costs and acts as a barrier for smaller companies with fewer resources. Netting Manager’s streamlined, user-friendly design allows multinational companies of all sizes to have the system up and running within days, compared to other existing systems that can take months to onboard.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>How does Netting Manager function? As per the <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2023/corpay-cross-border-business-launches-internal-invoicing-solution/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a>, the tool employs the financial technique of intercompany netting to consolidate each subsidiary’s payments into a single local currency transaction. Thus, different entities or branches within the same corporate group can get a balanced list of liabilities and receivables. In such a way, the company can minimize the number of actual payments made, identify foreign exchange exposure, and streamline its cash management processes.</p>
<p>Prior to launching Netting Manager, Corpay partnered with Sunflower Bank to help the bank’s clients manage cross-border payments and currency risk. In addition, Sunflower Bank&#8217;s clients got an opportunity to manage their global payments from a single point of access. The initiative worked out on single clients&#8217; accounts, the principle is similar to the newly launched tool for businesses.</p>
<h2>What Does It Mean for XRP?</h2>
<p>Corpay&#8217;s boost of cross-border payments makes many wonder if it will affect the performance of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XRP</a>. The concerns have also been fueled by the court&#8217;s ruling on the battle between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>). The court ruled that the sale of Ripple’s XRP tokens on exchanges and through algorithms did not constitute investment contracts, while the institutional sale of the tokens did violate federal securities laws. Over the past week, the coin has seen a more than 8% drop in price.</p>
<p>As of the press moment, the XRP price is standing at $0.70. The coin&#8217;s all-time high was $3.84 on January 4, 2018. Currently, XRP is more than 80% down from there. However, analysts and investors believe the coin will break the $1 mark.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/brad-garlinghouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brad Garlinghouse</a>, Ripple&#8217;s CEO, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The road map for Ripple remains the same, with wider adoption and increased positive sentiment of people towards cryptocurrencies in general, the future seems bright for XRP&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>The general rating for XRP is a &#8220;buy&#8221;, as experts are optimistic about the coin&#8217;s future.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/hi-30m-investment-animoca-brands/">Crypto &#8216;Super App&#8217; hi Sees $30M in Investment from Metaverse Gaming Giant Animoca Brands</a></p>
<p>Animoca Brands, a gaming and metaverse heavyweight has bet big on the crypto super app hi by investing $30 million into the project. According to the firm, the move is expected to boost the usage of non-fungible tokens (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFTs</a>) within the gaming industry.</p>
<h2>Animoca Brands and hi Aim at Improved NFT Utility in Gaming</h2>
<p>Recall that hi recently <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/europe/en/newsroom/press-releases/en/2022/september-2022/hi-launches-world-s-first-nft-customizable-card-with-mastercard/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">launched</a> a first-of-its-kind product that saw it partner with <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/mastercard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MasterCard</a>. And the products are debit cards that are customized with notable NFT collections including Bored Apes (BAYC), CryptoPunks, and others.</p>
<p>Although the cards are billed for shipping later this quarter, it appears that brands under Animoca might be next on hi&#8217;s radar.</p>
<p>According to hi co-founder Sean Rach, there are valuable opportunities within the Animoca ecosystem. And the firm is focused on exploring these opportunities to the fullest. That is with its hi debit cards. About the partnership, Rach said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“One of the key advantages will be enabling our users to make direct transactions with tokens from the Animoca Brands ecosystem such as SAND, EDU, APE, REVV, GMEE, and others through hi Debit Cards.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Hi to Use Fund for Growth and Expansion</h2>
<p>Concerning the new investment, Rach has also revealed how the firm intends to use the &#8220;significant&#8221; $30 million investment. He says part of it will be used to improve hi&#8217;s existing products and possibly develop some new ones.</p>
<p>Additionally, the remaining fund may be used to lend support to corporate accounts, says Rach. And considering that Animoca is already an established brand in the Latin America region, hi will seek to leverage the opportunity to foray into new markets.</p>
<p>Animoca Brands CEO Yat Siu has also hinted at what the firm expects of the new partnership. In a press release, Siu said Animoca will continue to support hi while it continues to develop its super app. He also suggested that the protocol looks to be driving a positive impact for the broader Web3 ecosystem, and so Animoca is more than willing to lend help to achieve that cause.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ftx-genesis-financial-dispute/">Bankrupt FTX and Genesis to Resolve Financial Dispute Soon</a></p>
<p>In a surprising turn of events, two former major players in the cryptocurrency space, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ftx-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX Trading Ltd</a>, and Genesis Global Holdco LLC, have decided to put an end to their protracted legal battle by reaching an in-principle agreement. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-28/bankrupt-crypto-platforms-ftx-genesis-set-to-resolve-dispute#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reports</a> from Bloomberg, the agreement, as conveyed by their legal representatives in a letter to the bankruptcy judge, will see both parties&#8217; claims against each other settled.</p>
<p>The clash between FTX and Genesis emerged as the former claimed that it was owed a staggering sum of up to $3.9 billion by the latter. FTX, once a prominent player in the crypto exchange landscape, suffered a significant downfall that led to its Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in November last year. Seeking to <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ftx-officials-3-88b-genesis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recover</a> its losses and debt, FTX pointed to Genesis as a debtor.</p>
<p>However, Genesis promptly denied the claim, contesting the legitimacy and magnitude of the debt asserted by FTX. The dispute escalated rapidly, and both companies found themselves entangled in a legal battle.</p>
<p>As the negotiations progressed, it became apparent that a compromise was within reach. The initial claim of $3.9 billion was reduced to a less significant sum of $2 billion. After an extended period of disagreement and legal wrangling, the legal teams representing FTX and Genesis have jointly confirmed their intention to settle the ongoing dispute outside the courtroom.</p>
<h2>FTX and Genesis Settlement: Approval Process Ahead</h2>
<p>While the intention to settle has been made public, the specifics of the arrangement have been kept under wraps. The absence of specific information in the letter to the bankruptcy judge leaves the broader crypto community eager to learn more about the terms of the settlement.</p>
<p>It is expected that both FTX and Genesis will soon file motions with the bankruptcy courts to seek approval of the deal. The court’s approval procedure will almost certainly include a comprehensive review of the arrangement to guarantee its fairness and conformity with existing bankruptcy laws and regulations.</p>
<p>The judge will evaluate whether the terms of the settlement adequately address the claims made by both parties and whether it is in the best interest of all stakeholders involved. For creditors, a swift resolution is essential as it ensures they can receive their owed funds without prolonged delays.</p>
<p>A prolonged dispute could have resulted in significant uncertainty and financial strain on these creditors, possibly affecting their own financial stability and operations. The settlement agreement, therefore, offers them a sense of relief, knowing that their claims might be addressed more efficiently.</p>
<p>In addition, the settlement sends a positive signal to the broader crypto community, regulators, and potential investors. It demonstrates the willingness of major players in the industry to resolve disputes responsibly and collaboratively.</p>
<p>This can help to boost investor confidence in the crypto market while also easing concerns among other creditors working with various companies in the sector.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/securitize-tokenized-real-estate-spain/">Securitize Expands to Europe with Issuance of Tokenized Real Estate Securities in Spain</a></p>
<p>United States-based tokenization firm and trading platform <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/securitize/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Securitize</a> is expanding to the European Union with the tokenization of Spanish real estate investment trust Mancipi Partners’ equity. According to the Thursday announcement, the firm is now the first to issue and trade tokenized securities in both the US and EU. Securitize is responsible for investor onboarding, share issuance, and capitalization table management.</p>
<p>The shares are tokenized on the Avalanche blockchain, with secondary trading expected to being in September. Tokenization is the process of turning traditional financial assets into digital tokens issued on a blockchain. The process has been lauded for its potential to reduce costs and improve efficiency. <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/blackrock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlackRock</a> CEO Larry Fink believes that “the next generation for markets, the next generation for securities, will be tokenization of securities.”</p>
<p>The move to issue tokenized real estate securities comes after Securitize’s entry into the Spanish General Secretariat of the Treasury and International Finance’s sandbox for digital asset securities. The firm is expected to operate under the EU’s Distributed Ledger Technology Pilot Regime set up in March by the European Commission and overseen by the European Securities Market Authority (ESMA). The goal of the pilot is to foster the trading of securities using blockchain technology in a regulated environment.</p>
<p>In the United States, Securitize is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a stock transfer agent and alternative trading system. It is also a part of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).</p>
<p>Commenting on the firm’s participation in the sandbox, Securitize Europe Brokerage and Markets CEO Amparo Garcia Flores <a href="https://decrypt.co/150295/tokenization-firm-securitize-kicks-off-european-campaign-spain" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“This is not just theoretical work; we are proving that what we have in the USA is feasible in Europe. This means we can open our market to both sides of the Atlantic, effectively doubling the size of our business and the opportunities for issuers in Europe who previously did not have the same opportunities as their American counterparts.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Flores also went on to highlight some advantages of tokenized over conventional capital markets, including the continuous full traceability of securities, reduced costs due to cutting out intermediaries, and direct market access for retail investors. Tokenization also improves liquidity by making the tokenized assets tradable on secondary markets in addition to benefiting businesses, a point raised by Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo.</p>
<p>“European businesses will be a major beneficiary of this innovation, giving businesses a new way to raise capital through primary capital raises, and obtain potential tax benefits and liquidity through secondary trading,” Domingo said.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-judge-cftc-case/">Binance Calls on Federal Judge to Dismiss CFTC Case against Company</a></p>
<p>Binance, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, filed a motion to dismiss a lawsuit brought against the company by the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/cftc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CFTC</a>). Attorneys representing the exchange submitted the request to a US federal judge on Thursday, asserting that the commodities watchdog lacks jurisdiction in several charges leveled against the company and its executives.</p>
<p>On July 25, Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/changpeng-zhao/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CZ</a>) revealed their plans to <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-ceo-dismissal-cftc/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">appeal</a> the CFTC lawsuit, which claimed that the company deliberately evaded US laws by permitting American users to engage in crypto derivatives trading activities without proper registration. The charges also include former chief compliance officer Samuel Lim for failing his duties.</p>
<p>Shortly after the disclosure, the company has now filed a motion to dismiss the case, citing inadequacies from the CFTC. Binance said in the appeal filed on Thursday, July 27, that the CFTC is attempting to exert authority beyond its statutory limits by trying to regulate foreign entities and individuals operating outside the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this case, the CFTC seeks to regulate foreign individuals and corporations that reside and operate outside the United States – outstripping the limits of its statutory authority and treading on deep-rooted principles of comity with foreign sovereigns,&#8221; reads the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ilnd.431767/gov.uscourts.ilnd.431767.59.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">court document</a>.</p>
<h2>Binance Claims that CFTC Lawsuit Is Based on Inconsistent Theories</h2>
<p>The exchange contends that the regulator&#8217;s claims are based on inconsistent theories and irrelevant allegations, and the CFTC&#8217;s attempts to assert its jurisdiction undermine the principles of cooperation with foreign sovereigns. Similarly, the company&#8217;s former compliance officer filed a motion to dismiss on the same grounds.</p>
<p>The case is currently being heard in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, with both parties submitting their arguments for dismissal without the need for an initial hearing. The court&#8217;s decision on the appeal will have significant implications for Binance, CZ, and the broader crypto industry.</p>
<p>Binance and its CEO have faced increasing <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-australia-offices-raided/">regulatory scrutiny</a> globally following the market downturn in 2022, which caused several major crises in the industry. Despite the company&#8217;s dominant position in the crypto markets, the exchange has recently witnessed a <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-us-market-share-plummets/">decline</a> in spot digital-asset trading volumes.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, CZ sought to address concerns about Binance&#8217;s outlook after the departure of key executives who played a role in navigating the regulatory challenges. The Binance boss disagreed with the CFTC&#8217;s characterization of many issues in its complaint, emphasizing that crucial facts were omitted.</p>
<p>The motion to dismiss filed by Binance&#8217;s legal team highlights the argument that CZ is not subject to US jurisdiction as he resides in the United Arab Emirates. The attorneys cited email interactions that allegedly occurred more than a year before Binance offered the derivatives products in question as evidence.</p>
<h2>Binance Faces More Regulatory Challenges in the US</h2>
<p>Aside from the CFTC lawsuit, Binance and CZ are also facing enforcement action by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>), which accused them of mishandling customer funds, misleading investors and regulators, and violating securities regulations.</p>
<p>In response to the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/sec-sues-binance-securities-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawsuit</a>, Binance vowed to defend its platform &#8220;vigorously&#8221;. However, both suits from the financial regulators have posed significant challenges to the exchange&#8217;s operations in the US and have the potential to impose monetary penalties and ban Binance and its executives from conducting business in the country.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/musk-stablecoin-x-debate/">Elon Musk-backed Stablecoin Launch via X Platform Sparks Crypto Legislative Debate</a></p>
<p>Musk recently rebranded Twitter to the X platform in a bid to venture into global financial markets through modern technology like blockchain and AI.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/musk-stablecoin-x-debate/">Elon Musk-backed Stablecoin Launch via X Platform Sparks Crypto Legislative Debate</a></p>
<p>On July 20, the United States Federal Service announced the official launch of its new system for instant payments dubbed the FedNow Service with 35 banks and credit unions already integrated. The move stirred different reactions from investors arguing that the Fed is slowly rolling out the digital dollar, while some states like Florida are against the move. As a result, large tech companies in the United States are already exploring the launch of US dollar-backed or algorithmic stablecoins.</p>
<p>For instance, tech billionaire <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/elon-musk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elon Musk</a> recently announced the transition of Twitter to his everything app dubbed X platform. Notably, Musk revealed earlier this week that the X platform intends to grow into a major global financial hub. As a result, speculations on the X platform integration with crypto assets like <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> and Dogecoin have significantly increased in the past few days. Additionally, experts believe Musk could soon launch a stablecoin to support payments on the X platform.</p>
<h2>Musk’s X Platform and Stablecoin Launch</h2>
<p>On Wednesday, the United States House Financial Services Committee passed seven pieces of legislation out of the Committee that establishes a regulatory framework for payment of stablecoins and protects self-custody for digital assets, among others. The Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act, which was introduced by Chairman Patrick McHenry, recognizes several regulatory paths for approving and regulating stablecoin issuers while protecting consumers. Notably, the bill was passed by a bipartisan vote, thus bringing stablecoins regulation much clearer in the United States.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BREAKING?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BREAKING</a>: Chairman <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickMcHenry?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PatrickMcHenry</a>&#39;s Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act passes the Financial Services Committee with BIPARTISAN support.</p>
<p>After fifteen months of bipartisan collaboration, this landmark legislation is one step closer to becoming law. <a href="https://t.co/vCiyqjyAAf">pic.twitter.com/vCiyqjyAAf</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Financial Services GOP (@FinancialCmte) <a href="https://twitter.com/FinancialCmte/status/1684748577031999488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 28, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>However, some legislators have voiced their fears over big tech companies and billionaires like Musk obtaining the rights to mint stablecoins. Essentially, the United States lawmakers argue the Fed is the only entity mandated to print or mint new cash as the government provides essential services to the people and taxes them less. The argument has, nonetheless, not resonated well with all investors, more so those who advocate for decentralization and freedom of democratic financial expression.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bipartisan fears of an Elon Musk stablecoin cloud crypto legislative debate</p>

<p>&mdash; *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) <a href="https://twitter.com/DeItaone/status/1684627336157696000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 27, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>With Musk’s X platform destined to venture into Web3 markets, experts <a href="https://u.today/elon-musks-potential-stablecoin-sparks-bipartisan-concern" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">believe</a> that it is only a matter of time before the tech billionaire launches stablecoins that run on a distributed ledger. However, Musk is likely to face a similar regulatory hurdle that Mark Zuckerberg faced with the Diem project, which Facebook abandoned.</p>
<h2>Bigger Picture</h2>
<p>The reset of the global financial systems was arguably triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic and the rise of digital payments, more so crypto assets. Furthermore, most governments have accelerated the cash printing process, thus further worsening the inflation menace. As a result, most investors have been fleeing to formerly perceived as risky assets like Bitcoin to hedge against rising inflation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ford-shares-q2-2023-earnings/">Ford Shares Drop 1% despite Q2 2023 Earnings Beating Analysts Expectations and Raising FY Guidance</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ford/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ford Motor Co</a> (NYSE: F) shares dropped approximately 1.17 percent during the after-hours session to trade around $13.57. The Ford shares dipped despite the company reporting better than expected Q2 2023  earnings and also raising the expectations for the full-year 2023 profitability. Additionally. The overall performance in F shares slightly dropped in the after-hours despite the company’s second-quarter earnings beating analysts’ expectations. Notably, Ford’s automotive revenue for the second quarter came in at $42.43 billion, compared to $40.38 billion estimated by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.</p>
<p>The company’s 12 percent increase in revenue YoY was largely contributed by the fact that its brands were America’s top-selling during the quarter. As a result, the company announced that its adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was 72 cents compared to 55 cents expected by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.</p>
<h2>Ford Q2 2023 Financial Results</h2>
<p>In Q2 2023, Ford announced that its dedication to the electric vehicle industry is unwavering amid global increased demand. Moreover, the United States government has in the recent past emphasized the shift to electric vehicles in a bid to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, the company warned that near-term EV adoption will be slower than expected. Nonetheless, Ford Model E revenue increased by 39 percent during the second quarter with a forecast of delivering up to 600k units by 2024.</p>
<p>“The near-term pace of EV adoption will be a little slower than expected, which is going to benefit early movers like Ford,” <a href="https://s201.q4cdn.com/693218008/files/doc_financials/2023/q2/7-27-23-Ford-Pro-Ford-Blue-Drive-Solid-Second-Quarter-Results-Company-Raises-Expectations-for-Full-Year-2023-Profitability.pdf">said</a> Ford CEO Jim Farley. “EV customers are brand loyal and we’re winning lots of them with our high-volume, first-generation products; we’re making smart investments in capabilities and capacity around the world; and, while others are trying to catch up, we have clean-sheet, next-generation products in advanced development that will blow people away.”</p>
<p>Notably, the company has significantly increased its battery production and also engaged in production at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Michigan. As a result, Ford announced last week that it would lower suggested retail prices for the all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck. The company’s market outlook is well bolstered by its strong balance sheet, which had nearly $30 billion of cash and more than $47 billion of liquidity at the end of the second quarter.</p>
<p>As a result, Ford lifted its guidance range for full-year 2023 consolidated adjusted EBIT to between $11 billion and $12 billion. Additionally, Ford raised its expectations for full-year adjusted free cash flow to between $6.5 billion and $7 billion, with capital expenditures of between $8 billion and $9 billion.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/roku-revenue-q2-2023-earnings/">Roku Scales Revenue and New User Estimates in Q2 2023 Earnings Report</a></p>
<p>Popular video streaming platform Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) reported earnings for Q2 2023, showing figures that surpassed analyst estimates for new users and revenue.</p>
<p>Roku revenue climbed 11% to $847.2 million, well above the $774.5 million predicted by analysts polled by FactSet. Also, the company lost 76 cents a share, lower than analysts’ expected $1.26. Q2’s loss is also lower than the 82 cents a share lost in Q2 of 2022.</p>
<p>Roku now has over 73 million active accounts, more than 16% higher than the 63.1 million recorded a year ago. Although streaming hours remained stagnant quarter over quarter, the company reported 25.1 billion, an increase from 20.7 billion for the same period last year. Device sales climbed 9% to $103.4 million.</p>
<p>Roku chief executive officer Anthony Wood and CFO Dan Jedda in a note to shareholders said the general TV advertising market has been slow, stating that it “remains muted industrywide.” However, the note informs that Roku ads are recovering, and assures that the company is ready to grow with the ad market correction.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We have begun to see some ad verticals improve, which resulted in modest YoY platform revenue growth in Q2, and we are well positioned to re-accelerate growth as the ad market recovers.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Roku predicts that its revenue for Q3 would hit $815 million, with a total gross profit of $255 million.</p>
<p>The company’s stock fell 4.59% on the day and closed at $68.19. However, as of writing time, ROKU has recovered the loss and climbed 8.51% to $73.99 in after-hours trading.</p>
<h2>Roku in Q1</h2>
<p>In the <a href="https://image.roku.com/c3VwcG9ydC1B/1Q23-Shareholder-Letter-Final.pdf">first quarter of 2023</a>, Roku’s total net revenue climbed 1% year over year (YoY) to $741 million, while platform revenue fell 1% YoY to $635 million. Gross profit fell 7% YoY to $338 million, with the platform’s average revenue per user (ARPU) falling 5% YoY to $40.67. Also, the company’s total operating expenses rose 42% YoY to 550.1 million from $388.3 million the year before.</p>
<h2>Roku Partnered with Shopify and Launched New TV in Q2 2023</h2>
<p>Last month, Roku announced a partnership with Canadian multinational e-commerce giant <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/shopify/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shopify</a> (NYSE: SHOP) to make shopping easier for customers. Roku integrated Shopify with the Action Ad service so that viewers can use their TV remotes to select an ad using their TV. When users see an ad for a product they may want, they can press OK for information about the product and eventually make payments using Roku Pay. At the time of the announcement, Roku stock jumped 11%.</p>
<p>Roku also recently launched the new 55-inch Polaroid Roku TV in the UK. Combining the Polaroid TV hardware with the streaming company’s OS, the new TV has a traditional setup for terrestrial functions, as well as access to most streaming services. Users can also push content from their phones as the TV has seamless iOS compatibility. The TV supports Dolby Audio and Dolby Vision, along with HDMI 2.0 for flexible connectivity.</p>

<p>Over the last month, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>) has been flooded with spot <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> ETF applications with BlackRock making the first moves. Later, some of the top financial giants submitted their Bitcoin ETF applications to the federal securities regulator. World&#8217;s largest crypto asset manager Grayscale Investments has now urged the SEC to approve all spot Bitcoin ETFs at once, thereby avoiding any one applicant getting the advantage over the other.</p>
<p>On Thursday, July 27, Grayscale&#8217;s Chief Legal Officer Craig Salm stated that his legal team has submitted a letter to the SEC for the eight Bitcoin ETF applications. He wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The SEC’s actions related to bitcoin ETFs should be done in a fair and orderly manner. As a disclosure-based regulator, the SEC should not pick winners and losers.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Grayscale clarifies that while they do not view the introduction of a spot bitcoin market as the definitive solution for approving spot bitcoin ETFs in the US. They are also supportive of initiatives that provide investors with access to the crypto ecosystem. As an organization committed to adhering to US financial regulations, Grayscale applauds any progress that enhances oversight of centralized crypto markets. Additionally, they expressed their willingness to take necessary actions to convert GBTC (Grayscale Bitcoin Trust) into an ETF.</p>
<h2>SEC should Have Fair Treatment for All Applicants</h2>
<p>In the past, the US SEC has rejected several spot Bitcoin ETF applications. However, with the world&#8217;s largest asset manager BlackRock participating this time, market analysts are quite bullish. For crypto fund managers like Grayscale, this is of course going to be a win-win situation in the end.</p>
<p>But Grayscale believes that SEC actions towards Bitcoin ETFs should be fair and in an orderly manner. &#8220;As a disclosure-based regulator, the SEC should not pick winners and losers; instead, the SEC should continue to provide issuers with feedback or guidance consistently and equitably,&#8221; <a href="https://grayscale.com/grayscales-latest-gbtc-comment-letter/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">noted</a> Grayscale.</p>

<p>According to Grayscale, the SEC should approve a spot bitcoin ETF in a fair manner that considers the interests of all investors and issuers, regardless of whether it happens due to a Court mandate or a shift in the SEC&#8217;s stance. Grayscale advocates for the simultaneous approval of all spot Bitcoin ETF applications to benefit Bitcoin, the market, and investors collectively.</p>
