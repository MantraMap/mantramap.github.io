					<description><![CDATA[Cboe updated the filings for the spot bitcoin ETF on its website shortly after the SEC said that the spot bitcoin ETF filings were not clear and comprehensive.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Cboe re-filtered five spot bitcoin ETF proposals on Friday following reports that the SEC had requested more information.</em></li>



<li><em>Cboe said it expected to sign a custody-sharing agreement with Coinbase.</em></li>



<li><em>Previously, the Exchange Operator, on behalf of five issuers of a spot bitcoin ETF filed it back with the SEC on Friday.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Exchange operator Cboe Global Markets Inc. <a href="https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/regulation/rule_filings/pending/2023/SR-CboeBZX-2023-028-Amendment-No-2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">updated</a> the filings for the spot bitcoin ETF on its website shortly after the SEC said that the spot bitcoin ETF filings were not clear and comprehensive.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2.png"><img decoding="async" width="660" height="440" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2.png" alt="Cboe Immediately Updates Bitcoin ETF Spot Profile After SEC Complaint" class="wp-image-199320" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2.png 660w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" title="Cboe Immediately Updates Bitcoin ETF Spot Profile After SEC Complaint 1"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Cboe, on behalf of five issuers of a spot bitcoin ETF filed with the SEC on Friday. Updated filings have been submitted to the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF, VanEck Bitcoin Trust, WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust, and Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust.</p>



<p>The refreshed filing is intended to address concerns raised by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). According to these people, the agency <a href="https://coincu.com/199277-sec-says-bitcoin-etf-inadequate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">notified </a>exchanges Nasdaq and Cboe Global Markets, which had submitted applications for asset managers such as BlackRock and Fidelity Investments, that the files needed to be more precise and thorough.</p>



<p>One key issue is that the exchanges did not name the cryptocurrency trading platforms they plan to enter into custody-sharing arrangements to help detect fraud in the underlying Bitcoin market.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-3.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="375" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-3.png" alt="Cboe Immediately Updates Bitcoin ETF Spot Profile After SEC Complaint" class="wp-image-199321" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-3.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-3-300x150.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-3-360x180.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" title="Cboe Immediately Updates Bitcoin ETF Spot Profile After SEC Complaint 2"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The filings, in the second iteration, named Coinbase as part of a custody-sharing agreement for ETF applications by Wise Origin, WisdomTree, VanEck, and Invesco Galaxy.</p>



<p>The updated document states that the product, The Spot BTC SSA, will show signs of a custody-sharing agreement split between the two. The filing says that setup will allow additional access to data related to spot Bitcoin transactions on Coinbase if the exchange determines it is necessary as part of a monitoring program.</p>



<p>Following the wave of BlackRock is a wide range of traditional and crypto asset managers. In recent days, Fidelity Investments, Cathie Wood&#8217;s Ark Investment Management, Invesco, WisdomTree, Bitwise Asset Management, and Valkyrie have all revived or revised their applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Kraken was ordered by a judge on Friday to provide certain user information to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Kraken has been ordered to provide certain user information to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS).</em></li>



<li><em>The IRS wants to identify accounts with more than $20,000 in crypto transactions annually between 2016 and 2020.</em></li>



<li><em>The judge said the government had a legitimate purpose to search the documents.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to The Block,<a href="https://coincu.com/195499-20-liquidity-drop-kraken-emerges-as-winner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Kraken</a> was ordered by a judge on Friday to provide certain user information to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="674" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1024x674.png" alt="Kraken Is Requested By The IRS For Customer Information From $20,000" class="wp-image-199314" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1024x674.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-300x197.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-768x505.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-750x493.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Kraken Is Requested By The IRS For Customer Information From $20,000 3"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The IRS wants the exchange to identify accounts with more than $20,000 in crypto transactions annually between 2016 and 2020. Kraken has previously objected to the IRS subpoena partly because its concerns will create a great burden. The exchange called the agency&#8217;s summons an &#8220;irrational treasure hunt,&#8221; arguing that it crossed the line.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;The Government has a legitimate purpose for seeking the materials described in the summon. As discussed above, the summons was issued in connection with an investigation by the IRS to determine the identity and correct federal income tax liability of US persons who conduct transactions in cryptocurrency during the period 2016-2020,&#8221;</p>
<cite>Judge Joseph C. Spero said in the court document.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Kraken will have to disclose information such as name, date of birth, physical address, phone number, and tax identification number.</p>



<p>Friday&#8217;s ruling in favor of the government comes amid a deepening US crackdown on cryptocurrencies. The Securities and Exchange Commission this month filed a lawsuit accusing Coinbase of operating an illegal exchange and alleging that Binance.US mishandled customer funds, misled investors and agencies&#8217; regulatory authorities as well as violations of securities rules.</p>

<p>Kraken is a leading cryptocurrency exchange with a daily trading volume of around $650 million globally, according to CoinMarketCap. The company did not immediately respond to an email request for comment on the ruling.</p>



<p>Kraken currently only offers US Forms 1099-MISC, 1099-INT, and 1099-NEC, which are filed with the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and a copy will be provided to you (if you qualify). This could change in the coming years as tax reporting laws constantly change.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>QuickNode adds support for XRP Ledger, boosting Web3 adoption.</em></li>



<li><em>XRPL offers reliability, fast transactions, and diverse use cases.</em></li>



<li><em>QuickNode simplifies infrastructure for developers, enabling high-quality dApp development.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>QuickNode, a leading provider of blockchain infrastructure solutions, has <a href="https://blog.quicknode.com/xrp-ledger-xrpl-blockchain-quicknode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> an interesting platform announcement. It supports the XRP Ledger (XRPL), making it the company&#8217;s 23rd blockchain technology.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2318.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="529" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2318-1024x529.png" alt="Blockchain Development Platform QuickNode Now Adds Support For XRP Ledger" class="wp-image-199306" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2318-1024x529.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2318-300x155.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2318-768x396.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2318-1536x793.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2318-750x387.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2318-1140x588.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2318.png 1860w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Blockchain Development Platform QuickNode Now Adds Support For XRP Ledger 5"></a></figure></div>


<p>QuickNode claims that XRPL may be used for a variety of purposes, including tokenization, CBDC, DeFi, and stablecoins. This integration intends to enable developers within the XRPL ecosystem and boost Web3 technology adoption via dependable and efficient blockchain solutions.</p>



<p>The XRPL offers developers significant utility and flexibility, allowing them to write in Python, Java, and JavaScript. The XRPL is appropriate for any independent developer or organization looking to create a wide range of use cases.</p>



<p>The XRPL is a very beneficial blockchain platform for developers looking to construct enterprises. Throughout the last decade, the protocol&#8217;s capabilities have been enhanced to allow for scalable blockchain development. This allows developers to begin on creative projects and applications in a variety of use cases, including as payments, tokenization, decentralized finance (DeFi), and others.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2320.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2320-1024x576.png" alt="Blockchain Development Platform QuickNode Now Adds Support For XRP Ledger" class="wp-image-199308" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2320-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2320-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2320-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2320-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2320-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2320.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Blockchain Development Platform QuickNode Now Adds Support For XRP Ledger 6"></a></figure></div>


<p>A Proof-of-Association (PoA) consensus method underpins the XRPL&#8217;s functionality. Validators, or network servers, achieve consensus every 3-5 seconds, assuring the sequence and result of XRP transactions. The XRPL&#8217;s robust encryption assures the system&#8217;s integrity, while transaction openness provides public accountability.</p>



<p>The addition of XRPL infrastructure to QuickNode&#8217;s platform expands the potential for developers globally. With rapid access to full blockchain capability, developers may tokenize assets, explore sophisticated payment systems, and exploit a variety of XRPL features without having to study, construct, and manage smart contracts.</p>



<p>QuickNode&#8217;s support for XRPL strengthens its position as a premier blockchain infrastructure provider. QuickNode enables developers to concentrate on creating high-quality decentralized apps (dApps) while easing their Web3 strategy by simplifying node management, synchronization, and providing a full platform. It has demonstrated its dependability and scalability in serving industry-leading projects by processing over 200 billion requests per month across 14+ locations globally.</p>

<p>QuickNode <a href="https://coincu.com/162220-quicknodes-series-b-round-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received</a> $60 million in Series B fundraising in January of this year, valuing the company at $800 million. Dan Tapiero&#8217;s 10T Holdings led the round, and Tapiero will also join QuickNode&#8217;s board of directors. According to The Block, other Series B backers included Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian&#8217;s Seven Seven Six, Protocol Labs, Tiger Global, and QED Investments.</p>



<p>The addition of XRPL to the QuickNode platform marks yet another step forward in the evolution of Web3 technologies. QuickNode helps the development and acceptance of blockchain solutions by offering developers with easy access to the established XRPL infrastructure, stimulating creativity, and increasing the possibilities within the XRPL ecosystem.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Celsius can now sell altcoins and plans to pay creditors in Bitcoin and Ethereum.</em></li>



<li><em>The decision was made after discussions with the SEC regarding regulatory requirements for less popular cryptocurrencies.</em></li>



<li><em>Celsius holds altcoins worth $218 million but filed for bankruptcy and is focusing on paying off debts while customer withdrawals remain on hold.</em></li>

<p>Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn of the Southern District of New York accepted the action, which Celsius suggested following conversations with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has said that a spectrum of less-used crypto coins needs regulatory permission.</p>



<p>On July 1, 2023, Celsius will be able to sell or convert any non-BTC and non-ETH cryptocurrency into BTC or ETH. Celsius has $70.5 million in CEL, $51.8 million in MATIC, $26.2 million in ADA, $17.3 million in LINK, and $14.4 million in LTC, among other investments.</p>



<p>The cryptocurrencies owned by Celsius amount to $218 million, according to an alleged balance sheet that went viral in April and include CEL, MATIC, ADA, LINK, LTC, DOT, BCH, AAVE, UNI, XLM, SOL, EOS, FIT, SRM, and BNB. Celsius&#8217; native token is CEL, while the remainder is largely MATIC and ADA.</p>

<p>The company has been in regular contact with the SEC and certain state regulatory agencies regarding the proposed distribution of cryptocurrency under the plan to ensure that all such distributions are in full compliance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations, according to the filing.</p>

<p>Celsius revealed on July 13, 2022, that it has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The organization said that it intends to continue functioning during the restructuring, albeit withdrawals will remain halted for the time being.</p>



<p>They have aggressively paid off project debt since then. In particular, the company spent about $800 million on Aave, Maker, and Compound.</p>



<p>Paying clients, on the other hand, is more challenging; a year has passed and many customers are still unable to take their funds. Nevertheless, insolvent cryptocurrency firms like BlockFi and Voyager Digital have declared that consumers would be able to withdraw their cash this summer.</p>

<p>OKX, the premier Web3 technology company, and Manchester City Club today named OKX as the club&#8217;s official sleeve partner in a new multi-year relationship.</p>



<p>OKX and Manchester City have signed their third sponsorship agreement in little over a year. OKX became the club&#8217;s official cryptocurrency partner in March 2022, and months later, it added sponsorship of Manchester City&#8217;s training clothes. Man City has accomplished a &#8220;treble&#8221; by winning all three of its major competitions: the Premier League, the FA Cup, and the UEFA Champions League.</p>

<p>City Football Group Chief Executive Officer Ferran Soriano and OKX Global Chief Marketing Officer Haider Rafique were present for an exclusive unveiling at the Etihad Stadium. The sleeve was revealed as part of the event in a &#8216;virtual reveal&#8217; with a movie involving player avatars. Gael Clichy, a Manchester City great, was also there for a media Q&amp;A. In the statement, Soriano stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“We are very proud to have OKX represented on the sleeve of the Manchester City shirt. We have already seen great web3 experiences designed by OKX for Manchester City’s global fan base and there will be many more to come.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>City Football Group (CFG) is a British conglomerate that owns Manchester City as well as other soccer clubs such as New York City FC and Melbourne City FC. Newton Investment and Development LLC, an Abu Dhabi-based firm completely controlled by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, owns the majority of CFG.</p>



<p>Haider Rafique added:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“The journey with the Man City team has been incredible. Manchester City was our first official global brand partnership and in just a year and a half we have come a long way. We always intended to integrate with the sport and help the Club lead on leaning into Web3. Fast forward fifteen months, we now have a metaverse, an NFT initiative and a number of other new projects that we are excited about.</p>

<p>OKX also became a presenting partner for City&#8217;s 2022 trophy tour as part of last year&#8217;s agreement.

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The SEC finds recent applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs insufficient due to clarity and thoroughness.</em></li>



<li><em>Asset managers, including Fidelity and Ark Investment, are modifying their applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs.</em></li>



<li><em>Approval of a Bitcoin ETF could revolutionize the industry by increasing accessibility and transforming the cryptocurrency market.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to persons familiar with the subject, the Securities and Exchange Commission has ruled that a recent wave of applications submitted by asset managers to create spot Bitcoin ETF (exchange-traded fund) is insufficient, <em>WSJ</em> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-says-spot-bitcoin-etf-filings-are-inadequate-390336e8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2310-1024x683.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2310-1024x683.png" alt="BREAKING: SEC Says Bitcoin ETF Filings Are Inadequate, Market Panic" class="wp-image-199280" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2310-1024x683.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2310-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2310-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2310-750x500.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2310.png 1040w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="BREAKING: SEC Says Bitcoin ETF Filings Are Inadequate, Market Panic 14"></a></figure></div>


<p>According to the persons, the agency notified exchanges Nasdaq and Cboe Global Markets, which submitted the applications on behalf of asset managers such as BlackRock and Fidelity Investments, that the files weren&#8217;t sufficiently clear and thorough.</p>



<p>Following in BlackRock&#8217;s footsteps were a slew of conventional and crypto asset managers. In recent days, Fidelity Investments, Cathie Wood&#8217;s Ark Investment Management, Invesco, WisdomTree, Bitwise Asset Management, and Valkyrie have all revived or modified their applications for a spot Bitcoin ETF.</p>



<p>Since 2017, the SEC has frequently rejected such funds on the grounds that they are prone to fraud and market manipulation. At least a half-dozen ETFs that hold Bitcoin futures are already available.</p>



<p>The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) trading volume increased as a result of the current interest from mainstream players in Bitcoin ETFs. Nonetheless, analysts believe that the SEC in the United States may be obliged to accept the Grayscale Bitcoin ETF proposal soon.</p>



<p>Since Grayscale filed an appeal against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s decision to deny its application in June 2022, the two sides have exchanged legal files in addition to oral evidence heard by three U.S. federal appellate court judges on March 7.</p>

<p>Prices for Bitcoin and other crypto-related equities have risen since <a href="https://coincu.com/195477-blackrock-to-expand-more-bitcoin-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BlackRock</a> submitted paperwork with the SEC for an ETF that contains genuine Bitcoin in mid-June. The cryptocurrency has risen by approximately 20%, surpassing $30,000 for the first time since April. At the same time period, shares of Coinbase Global, which is listed as the custodian for the BlackRock fund&#8217;s assets, have risen by more than 30%.</p>



<p>Several industry observers believed that BlackRock&#8217;s submission would allay the SEC&#8217;s worries by committing to share &#8220;monitoring&#8221; of a spot Bitcoin trading platform with Nasdaq, which would list the ETF.</p>



<p>An ETF that reflects the real price of Bitcoin would be a game changer for the industry since it would allow more people to invest in the cryptocurrency. It would enable investors to purchase and sell Bitcoin via a brokerage account in the same way that they do stocks.</p>



<p>The day after the news, Bitcoin and the entire crypto market had a massive crash that erased today&#8217;s bull efforts.</p>

<p>Blofin manages assets, executes transactions, and offers additional services to foreign compliance institutions and clients. It currently has a US federal MSB license, has filed compliance funds with the Cayman Monetary Authority, and is seeking equivalent services in Hong Kong, Singapore, Canada, Switzerland, Australia, and other licensing areas.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Ethereum (ETH) has shown stability compared to Bitcoin and modest gains compared to some altcoins during a recent downward correction.</em></li>



<li><em>The price of Ethereum has recently increased by over 8%, with positive investor sentiment.</em></li>



<li><em>Breaking through resistance at $1,925 could lead to further rises toward $2,040 and potentially surpass the $2,125 barrier.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ethereum (ETH) is showing similar stability to Bitcoin. Contrary to the recent gallop of some altcoins, ETH remains one of the large-cap coins with modest gains.</strong></h5>

<p>Ethereum price started a downward correction below $1,885 following a spike to $1,900 today. <a href="/t/eth/">ETH</a> previously spiked below $1,820 on June 15, but the drop has been limited, unlike Bitcoin.</p>



<p>Besides, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin shows that <a href="https://coincu.com/t/eth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ETH</a> is lagging behind other tokens is not an issue.</p>



<p>A user inquired about Buterin&#8217;s thoughts on the US Governmental approach to cryptocurrency in light of recent enforcements. The Ethereum creator expressed regret that significant projects like as Solana are being targeted in this manner. He said that these blockchains do not deserve this treatment.</p>



<p>He said that if Ethereum wins and all other blockchains are booted off crypto exchanges, it would not be an honorable way to win. But, he claims that this isn&#8217;t even a long-term win.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2302.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="959" height="640" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2302.png" alt="Ethereum Stable At $1,820, What About $2,000 Target?" class="wp-image-199247" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2302.png 959w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2302-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2302-768x513.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2302-750x501.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 959px) 100vw, 959px" title="Ethereum Stable At $1,820, What About $2,000 Target? 23"></a></figure></div>


<p>The price of Ethereum has increased as purchasing power has accumulated near support levels, signaling a positive mindset and increased investor interest. Ethereum&#8217;s price has surged by more than 8% in the previous 24 hours. With its present momentum and the broader rising trend in the crypto market, Ethereum might reclaim the $2,000 level if Bitcoin&#8217;s price continues to rise into the $35,000 region.</p>

<p>Through the price chart above, to hit $2,000, ETH needs to break through its nearest resistance level at $1,925. In the near term, the $1,820 price zone is unlikely to come back, as if the price hits this level again, it would mean that recent gains have been erased. Closing above $1,925 might spark a new rise. The next level of resistance is at $2,000, over which the price might increase to $2,040. Any more advances might push Ether beyond the $2,125 barrier level.</p>



<p>The fact that the current price is at the Fib 50% level is also a condition for ETH to slow down the uptrend, if there is a breakout, it is likely that the price will break above the Fib 61.8% level corresponding to $1,950.</p>

<p>For developers, v9.2 introduces an improved interface with enhanced search and tracking capabilities and extended development platform support.</p>



<p>The upgrade will introduce several improvements and new features to optimize performance and enhance cross-chain functionality. Among them, the main enhancements are enhancing interoperability between EVM and Scilla, and simplifying ERC-20 and ZRC-2 smart contracts to create, test, and launch codes alternative messages to facilitate seamless cross-chain interactions.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Zilliqa?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#Zilliqa</a> network is gearing up for a major upgrade on July 5th with v9.2, which brings enhanced performance and builds out EVM compatibility!<br><br>Find out more about the upcoming upgrade and how it will benefit users, developers, and node operators: <a href="https://t.co/SaeEGBMO01" target="_blank">https://t.co/SaeEGBMO01</a>… <a href="https://t.co/hVDAgDutvf" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/hVDAgDutvf</a></p>&mdash; Zilliqa (@zilliqa) <a href="https://twitter.com/zilliqa/status/1674711879695077376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June 30, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Other improvements include extended testing coverage for third-party EVM contracts and full backward compatibility with all Scilla contracts currently in the Scilla 0.13.3 release. This reinforces Zilliqa&#8217;s commitment to security and robust functionality.</p>



<p>Additionally, the upgrade includes various bug fixes, improved server-side resiliency and overall network performance improvements, the introduction of enhanced search and tracking capabilities for developers, and support for Extended development platform support.</p>



<p>The Zilliqa team will provide quick updates on the completion of the upgrade and appreciate the understanding and patience of all network participants during this period.</p>



<p>Zilliqa (ZIL) is one of the cryptocurrencies designed to solve the scalability and transaction processing problems plaguing the Ethereum network. However, the recent Ethereum consolidation and stiff competition in the Layer 2 scaling space with newer protocols offering higher throughput have declined Zilliqa (ZIL) usage.</p>



<p>However, the positive news about improvements from the main network update motivates the ZIL price to increase sharply by nearly 9% in the past 24 hours. Currently, ZIL is trading at $0.212.</p>
