<p class="s5">Over the last few months, the growth of cryptocurrency has shifted to one of enthusiasm, with discussions centered on decentralized finance, NFTs, and token games. As the niche evolves in quest of more intriguing use cases and, ultimately, value for its members, a new model has developed - play to earn.</p>
<p class="s5">Taunt Battleworld is the world's first engage-to-earn NFT fighting game simulator, created by Amazon, EA, and Unity industry veterans. This vision combines the strength of NFTs, the thrill of a fighting game, and a comprehensive ecosystem that adds value to users in every aspect of play while sustaining a strong token and gaming economy.</p>
<p class="s5">If the UFC is to the real world, then Taunt Battleworld is the UFC of the Metaverse. The platform is a one-stop experience for both gaming and entertainment. Everyone should take advantage of the Lootbox Sales and Token Sellout. First, tokens will be released in Q4 through BSCPad, Bullperks, and Bybit directly.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s5">In addition, unique Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) will be available in the Lootbox. This is remarkable. All investors can quickly hop on the ongoing Lootbox pre-registration program to enjoy every benefit that comes with it.</p>
<p class="s5">Interestingly, the platform uses blockchain technology and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to provide innovative gaming and entertainment experiences. The team is committed to providing inclusive gaming that is cross-platform and cross-blockchain whenever possible. The aim is to bring Taunt Battleworld to the community's doorsteps, no matter where they are.</p>
<p class="s9">The Core Edges of the Game</p>
<p class="s5">The game, being a skill-based fighting simulator, is the first to combine the fastest-growing segment in Gamefi into one ecosystem. It also employs a novel method of play known as "engage-to-earn." Players will be paid in real-time during each phase of gameplay by merging watch-to-earn and predict-to-earn elements using unique interactive technology.</p>
<p class="s5">Taunt Battleworld is set in a post-apocalyptic world where the old Gods have transformed Earth into Battleworld, their playground. In addition, as an exciting new NFT game where you own and manage Acolyte Warriors on a quest to become champions, players can acquire, grow, and test their warriors against others in the grand arenas of the new world. This is done to achieve favor with the Old Gods.</p>
<p class="s5">NFTs are obtained from the marketplace via Genesis drops or secondary market sales. Players can, on the other hand, obtain NFTs created by other players through bleeding that is listed on the company&rsquo;s marketplace.&nbsp; Surprisingly, durable power-ups and enhancements can also be obtained to give a fighter a competitive advantage in the game.</p>
<p class="s5">25,000 of the universe's strongest warriors have been summoned to a never-ending battle for domination. How fights are won is just as essential as the fact that they are won. Above all, taunting is both encouraged and rewarded.</p>
<p class="s5">The Genesis Skull Pass, which will be available on the Ethereum network, will be the first NFT drop for Taunt Battleworld. This is done to maximize the number of people that could be adopted into Taunt Battleworld.</p>
<p class="s5">It is necessary to mention that the Polygon (Matic) network will&nbsp; be used to run the game's blockchain components. Fast speeds and minimal transaction fees will be possible while retaining high security. Wherever practical, the company intends to use Chainlink's Verifiable Random Function (VRF) for randomization processes.</p>
<p class="s9">Play, Watch and Predict to Earn</p>
<p class="s5">To compete for real-world prizes, players must enter their Acolyte Warriors into tournaments. Warriors have the best chance of winning if the players choose their runes and matches wisely. It's also possible to make money by watching brawls. Players are rewarded for sharing their knowledge of the Old Gods with the rest of the community.</p>
<p class="s5">To summarize, competing against others in live prediction contests with no monetary stakes is a significant advantage. Players use their knowledge and wits to progress to higher NFTs. Indeed,&nbsp; Taunt Battleworld values strategy, skills, and accessibility!</p>
<p class="s5">Additionally, the company&rsquo;s data cooperation with Esports Technologies (NASDAQ: $EBET) will provide new experiences and betting solutions for the Taunt Battleworldcommunity to gamble on events outside of the blockchain.</p>
<p class="s9">The Team and Its Structures</p>
<p class="s5">The team's ultimate goal is for players to be able to play Taunt Battleworld on the platforms of their choice. Soldiers are placed into Brawls to fight (much like in a 2D fighting game), but instead of controlling them directly, players choose their strategy. Everyone can profit from the ecosystem in a variety of ways as they fight and win or lose.</p>
<p class="s5">The team has been working tirelessly to bring its Acolyte Warrior NFTs, as well as the Alpha gaming platform and the Token Genesis Event, ready for launch. They've also been fast expanding to serve the Taunt Battleworld long-term strategy. Over 20 individuals are working on the product, including full-time contractors and staff.</p>
<p class="s5">Taunt Battleworld collaborates with a number of key partners. Chainlink - VRF, ASM, and Polygon are compatible blockchains. Furthermore, NAP Alliance and Magic Eden are two significant marketplaces. Similarly, BSCpad and Bullperks Launchpads are platform perks.</p>
<p class="s5">The Platform also has specific drops in place with IP partners including Floyd Mayweather, Cris Cyborg, and others. Furthermore, with backers such as Polygon Studios, Genblock Capital, and Shima Capital ($4.3 million raised), the team has prioritized development.&nbsp;</p>
