			  <description><![CDATA[<p>CryptoUK today published a detailed response to His Majesty&rsquo;s Treasury&rsquo;s (HMT) Future Financial Services Regulatory Regime for Cryptoassets consultation paper.</p>
<p>CryptoUK, the trusted voice of the crypto industry in the United Kingdom, published a detailed response to His Majesty&rsquo;s Treasury&rsquo;s (HMT) Future Financial Services Regulatory Regime for Cryptoassets consultation paper.</p>
<p>Consultation proposals included strengthening rules for cryptocurrency trading platforms and a robust world-first regime for crypto lending. The consultation began in February and will close on 30 April 2023. Following its closure, the UK government will consider feedback and work to formulate a response to consolation proposals.</p>
<p>Su Carpenter, Director of Operations at CryptoUK, commented on the consultation, saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We believe that a regulatory regime for cryptoassets is key to enabling the UK to be competitive as a destination for the fast-growing cryptoasset market.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Adding:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We support the &lsquo;same risk, same regulatory outcome&rsquo; approach and continued UK commitment to the development and promotion of international standards, given the cross-border nature of the crypto-asset industry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carpenter further said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We would welcome the UK taking a leading role in promoting safe and orderly cryptoasset markets given that this will both support the further development of the crypto industry as well as the competitiveness of the UK as a destination for crypto firms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Concluding:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We welcome proactive engagement with industry by the HMT and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in preparation of both a UK crypto asset regulatory framework.</p>
<p>We suggest taking a broader view at all of the enablers for the UK to deliver on its ambition to become a global hub for the crypto industry, which includes a proportionate application of FinProm rules to trading venues, addressing concerns of de-banking by the crypto industry and progressive tax policy that addresses the nuances of the asset class.&rdquo;</p>

CryptoUK&rsquo;s Recommendations
<p>Su also detailed CryptoUK&rsquo;s specific recommendations on HMT&rsquo;s regime.</p>
<p>A predictable and transparent registration process:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We support an indicative timeline for the entire application process and welcome detailed, clear and upfront guidance on expectations towards industry by the FCA akin to the recent feedback statement on good and bad quality applications under the Money Laundering Regulations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pragmatic rules around disclosures:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We believe that disclosure requirements should provide the right information to consumers but not put disproportionate liability on trading venues. We also suggest international alignment with other jurisdictions to avoid multiple disclosure standards emerging.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Custody and safekeeping of client assets are fundamental to building consumer trust:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trading venues should segregate holdings of cryptoassets on behalf of their clients from their own holdings, and make this verifiable through periodic on-chain checks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Setting a global standard for safe, transparent and orderly markets:</p>

<p>"We believe that the FCA can take a leading role globally in promoting safe, transparent and orderly markets through adoption of a phased approach where trading venues are first responsible for implementing market abuse rules on their own venues before adopting trade surveillance tools at a global level.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The creation of an asset-reference stablecoin category:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We acknowledge that only fiat-backed stablecoins are likely to be considered and/or allowed to be marketed as stablecoins or e-money. However, we believe a broader stablecoin category or regime that includes algorithmic stablecoins and crypto-backed tokens could be prudent, and would reflect the reality that these cryptoassets continue to have use cases in cryptoasset ecosystems, such as trading pairs."</p>

<p>DeFi remains nascent and non-systemic and may require new approaches:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are supportive of HMT&rsquo;s forbearance in seeking to develop a prescriptive framework for the regulation of DeFi before any international standards and approaches emerge. We would support a separate consultation of industry in the identification and development of industry best practices and potential novel supervisory approaches.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Clarity on the regulatory treatment of staking:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We would support industry consultation on regulatory treatment of staking in the short term given its growing importance for the cryptoasset industry.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>As the US government approaches the deadline to raise its $13.4 trillion debt ceiling, how does this affect Bitcoin?</p>
The debt ceiling fiasco
<p>A periodic war between both parties in the US government is over the raising of the country&rsquo;s debt ceiling. It is always the case that the opposition party will take the governing party to the wire and extract as much advantage as it can before agreeing the new debt ceiling.</p>
<p>The debt ceiling is the maximum amount of debt that the US can borrow in order to meet its financial obligations. Analysts predict that the US could run out of money by Q3 or Q4 this year, while some are saying that weak tax receipts for April may bring the deadline forward.</p>
<p>If the US should somehow not be able to raise the debt ceiling in time it will default on its debts, something that is almost unthinkable for the US government, and would potentially lead to a global economic crisis.</p>
<p>So would a US debt default be good for Bitcoin?</p>
Bitcoin thrives in the good times
<p>Some might argue that a US debt default would lead to investors fleeing the dollar and seeking alternatives such as Bitcoin, gold, and other sound forms of money.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it could also be argued that an economic crisis could lead to a drop in assets across the board, but this might only be temporary as investors would need to put their money somewhere, although it must be admitted that cash is traditionally where investors go first in a crisis.</p>
<p>Another bonus for Bitcoin could be when the Federal Reserve stops raising interest rates and is forced to commence quantitative easing once again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, with inflation still hovering in the background the Fed will be walking a tightrope. With recession looking reasonably likely for the end of 2023 into 2024, the Fed will have to weigh up helping the economy out, against possibly sparking off inflation to the upside once again.</p>
Can Bitcoin flourish in bad times?
<p>Bitcoin tends to do much better in times when there is plenty of liquidity in the economy, but with ever-present inflation waiting to rear its ugly head, the Fed might feel that it can&rsquo;t step in.</p>
<p>The time has come when Bitcoin needs to step up and be a store of value in the good times as well as the bad. Should more banks start to fail then Bitcoin will need to step up and become that reliable store of value..</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The US economy is sinking towards recession as GDP came in at only 1.1% for Q1. Bitcoin on the other hand is continuing its rise.</p>
Economic factors
<p>Probably the most important factor for economic well being is oil. Oil drives economies, and strong demand for it signals a healthy economy that is using oil to fuel its industrial base.</p>
<p>However, in these current times, in spite of OPEC countries reducing their output, the price of oil is continuing to decrease as demand falters due to falling economic growth.</p>
<p>In the US, GDP growth for Q1 dwindled to 1.1%. This was an unexpectedly sharp fall given that the projection had been for 2%. In addition, the fall was also dramatic given that GDP had been at 2.6% for Q4 of 2022.</p>
De-Dollarisation
<p>Another looming problem for the dollar is that de-dollarisation is happening. Other countries around the world are starting to move away from the dollar, probably due to its recent weaponisation by the US government, by imposing sanctions against any other country it does not agree with.</p>
<p>Russia is using yuan for trade, Argentina will pay for Chinese imports in yuan, India is settling some trades in rupees, Brazil and China are deciding whether to not use the dollar in trades between them, and Saudi Arabia is considering accepting the yuan for oil exports to China.</p>
<p>However, de-dollarisation will likely be a slow process, given that dollar exchange reserves are nearly twice those of the euro, yen, pound, and yuan combined, and this is the same as it was a decade ago.</p>
<p>The dollar accounts for 58% of all central bank foreign exchange reserves and this will probably not change any time soon. Nevertheless, a wind of change has begun to blow, and the dollar hegemony is on the wane.</p>
Dollar still in control
<p>Notwithstanding, the dollar has been described as the least dirty shirt in the laundry. It has its issues and detractors, but it is still the world&rsquo;s reserve currency, and all the other fiat currencies are much weaker.</p>
<p>The Brics nations of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, are said to be developing a new reserve currency that will be backed by real substance, such as commodities.</p>
The evil of CBDCs
<p>Be that as it may, fiat currencies all go to zero over time and this has been proved throughout history. The only last throw of the dice for those wishing to maintain complete control, is the imposition of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).</p>
<p>CBDCs would enable central banks to exert the kind of control that up to now could only be read about in science fiction books. CBDCs would give the power to micro manage an individual's account, including setting time limits on spending, deciding what can and can&rsquo;t be bought, and even direct sanctions should the individual do something that was thought to be against the interests of the State.</p>
Be your own bank with Bitcoin
<p>Among all this morass of fiat currency misery there is still one asset that is outside of the grip of governments and central banks, and that is Bitcoin. Bitcoin is completely decentralised, cannot be taken away, and enables an individual to be their own bank.</p>
<p>Banks are antiquated behemoths of a bygone age. They do not serve depositors given that they make the decision of who we can or can&rsquo;t transact with, they provide no return when inflation is taken into account, and if enough depositors demand their money at one time, the bank will fail given that it holds almost no deposits due to zero fractional reserve.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is cyclical, so history tells us that it does go up and down in price, sometimes quite wildly, but it is a nascent asset class and therefore it will take time for its volatility to subside.</p>
<p>The main thing is that it is the people&rsquo;s money, and it reduces the reliance people need to have on governments and the banks. As the evil of CBDCs approaches, it would be incumbent on all to do their best to research Bitcoin with a view to getting out of a crumbling and dangerous fiat monetary system.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s7">In the midst of a fluctuating crypto market, Stellar (XLM) struggles to gain momentum, while investors turn their attention to the promising Sparklo (SPRK). While XLM's performance raises questions, the excitement surrounding Sparklo's innovative approach and potential growth offers a compelling alternative for investors seeking better prospects in the cryptocurrency space.</p>
<p class="s9">Why is Stellar (XLM) doing so poorly</p>
<p class="s7">There are several potential reasons for Stellar (XLM) &nbsp;poor performance:</p>
1. Market dynamics: In a highly volatile and competitive market, some cryptocurrencies tend to perform better than others. Factors such as market sentiment, investor confidence, and overall market trends can impact the performance of individual tokens like XLM.
&nbsp;
2. Increased circulation: Events like the Coinbase Stellar airdrop may have inadvertently contributed to XLM's price decline. The airdrop increased the token's circulation, leading to a dilution of value and potentially affecting its price negatively.
&nbsp;
3. Competition: XLM faces stiff competition from other bank-centric tokens like Ripple's XRP. This rivalry can lead to a divided market and reduced investor interest, impacting its performance.
&nbsp;
4. Lack of major developments: While Stellar has had some notable partnerships, like IBM's decision to use the Stellar blockchain, the project might need more significant developments to sustain interest and drive growth.
&nbsp;
5. Uncertainty in the market: The overall uncertainty surrounding the cryptocurrency market can contribute to the poor performance of individual tokens like XLM.
<p class="s7">While these factors may be responsible for Stellar' current struggles, it is essential to keep in mind that the cryptoverse is highly unpredictable, and XLM's performance could improve in the future.</p>
<p class="s9">Why are investors excited about Sparklo (SPRK)</p>
<p class="s7">Enthusiasm for Sparklo (SPRK) is fueled by numerous factors, positioning it as an enticing alternative in the cryptocurrency arena:</p>
1. Pioneering platform: The trailblazing Sparklo platform enables users to make fractional investments in silver, gold, and platinum via minted and fractionalized NFTs. This presents investors with an innovative approach to engage in alternative investments, broadening their portfolios and accessing emerging markets.
&nbsp;
2. Integration of tangible assets: Upon obtaining a complete NFT on Sparklo's platform, users can choose to receive the corresponding real-world asset (silver, gold, or platinum) at a preferred location. This feature imbues the investment with tangible value and bridges the gap between the physical asset and digital asset realm.
&nbsp;
3. Affordable presale price: Sparklo's presale offers an attractive entry point for investors, with a highly competitive price of $0.015 per token. This affordable pricing allows a broader range of investors to participate in the project early on, potentially leading to significant returns as the platform gains traction.
&nbsp;
4. Partnerships and collaborations: Sparklo has partnered with leading jewelry retailers, granting investors access to new products and exclusive discounts. These collaborations add value to the project and expand its reach in the market.
&nbsp;
5. Security and transparency: Sparklo has passed its audit with Interfi Network and locked its liquidity for 100 years, ensuring a secure investment environment for its users. Additionally, the team tokens are locked for 1,000 days, showcasing the commitment and long-term vision of the Sparklo team.
<p class="s7">The unique value proposition, innovative platform, and early investment opportunities are capturing the attention and excitement of investors. Join in the excitement today!</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s7">The cryptocurrency realm is evolving at a breathtaking pace, and the once-celebrated Internet Internet Computer (ICP) has faced turbulence, sparking curiosity among investors. Enter Sparklo (SPRK), a groundbreaking contender boasting unparalleled innovation and stability. </p>
<p class="s7">This fresh alternative is poised to capture the attention of investors, championing a new era in decentralized computing. Embark on a journey to explore the ascent of Sparklo, the emerging force set to redefine the digital asset landscape.</p>
<p class="s9">ICP Crash: A Mystifying Decline Riddled with Unanswered Questions</p>

The project promised innovations that could compete with tech giants like Google, Facebook, and Amazon, offering attributes such as increased speed, reduced cost, and scalability.</p>
<p class="s7">However, the Internet Computer &nbsp;(ICP) token's sudden and dramatic plunge has left the crypto community in disarray, with some suspecting foul play by the project's creators. While Internet Computer &nbsp;(ICP) decline could be attributed to the general cryptocurrency market crash, a report by Arkham Intelligence raises suspicions of fraud.

<p class="s7">Arkham Intelligence's report also calls attention to ethical concerns regarding Dfinity's project administration, accusing the organization of a lack of transparency in token allocation and unlocking processes. This intriguing crash of the Internet Computer &nbsp;(ICP) token has left investors with more questions than answers, casting a shadow of doubt over the project's future.</p>
<p class="s9">The Emergence of a Superior Alternative: Sparklo (SPRK) Takes Center Stage</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Arbitrum (ARB) has notably impacted Ethereum&rsquo;s scalability, and analysts expect it to continue playing an essential role in the growth of blockchain-based applications and the broader Ethereum ecosystem. Yet, as the short-lived increase in the Arbitrum (ARB) trading volume dies down, investors turn their heads over to a game-changing altcoin &ndash; one that is set to revolutionize the lending industry.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s8">What Is Arbitrum (ARB)?</p>
<p>Offchain Labs developed Arbitrum (ARB) in 2018. It is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that aims to improve the network&rsquo;s scalability and speed while reducing transaction costs.</p>
<p>Arbitrum (ARB) uses the Optimistic Rollups technology to bundle multiple transactions together off the main Ethereum chain, thus improving the overall performance.</p>
<p class="s8">Is Arbitrum (ARB) A Viable Investment?</p>
<p>In the last few days, Arbitrum (ARB) surpassed Bitcoin in transaction fees and BNB in trading volume. Arbitrum (ARB) reached an all-time high in the number of users, currently at 5 million.</p>
<p>However, after Arbitrum&rsquo;s (ARB) boom, the ARB token is facing price reductions. At the time of writing, Arbitrum's (ARB) price is at $1.32, down by 0.43%, Arbitrum&rsquo;s market cap, currently down by 0.24%, and trading volume, currently down by 29.09%.</p>
<p>Arbitrum (ARB) investors and analysts predict its price to rise by a dollar by the end of this year, but many are also selling their ARB coins after the recent boom it experienced.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="s8">Why Are ARB Investors Turning to COLT?</p>
<p>Collateral Network (COLT) is a decentralized lending platform set to change how we get funds and loans. Thanks to COLT, people can get loans much easier and faster, while investors can finance loans and get fixed interest payments weekly.</p>
<p>You can send real-world assets, like watches or jewelry, over to Collateral Network (COLT). Then, Collateral Network (COLT) will value it and give you a loan by minting your asset into an asset-backed NFT and selling fractions of it to Collateral Network (COLT) holders. The Collateral Network (COLT) holders that finance portions of the loan will get fixed interest payments weekly, and if the borrower fails to pay the loan, investors can buy the asset at below-market value.</p>
<p>Once the borrower pays the loan, Collateral Network (COLT) will burn the NFT and return the asset to the borrower. While the loan is repaid, the asset is held in Collateral Network&rsquo;s (COLT) vault.</p>
<p>Collateral Network (COLT) is currently in public presale, and even now, it&rsquo;s faced with outstanding growth predictions of 35x during presale only!</p>
<p class="s8">Can COLT Reach Its Projected 100x Growth?</p>
<p>Chances are, Collateral Network (COLT) will reach its forecasted 100x growth once it enters major exchanges, such as CEX and DEX, and here&rsquo;s why:</p>
● Collateral Network has the first-mover advantage in the market, potentially disrupting the pawnbroking industry and reinventing peer-to-peer lending.
● It solves market issues, such as difficulty obtaining loans for non-traditional assets, geographical barriers to credit, and the red tape associated with short-term loans.
● Offers a borderless, permissionless, and transparent system for borrowing against alternative assets, with fair borrowing terms stored on the blockchain.
● Grants investors the necessary security through asset-backed loans.
● Collateral Network&rsquo;s robust ecosystem includes a marketplace, auctions, and crowdlending features.
● The token offers discounts, auction access, staking, and governance rights to its holders.
● The project has a clear token distribution plan with locked team tokens, a locked liquidity pool, and an audited smart contract.
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s8">Conclusion</p>
<p>Collateral Network is a new web3 project set to revolutionize the crypto and lending industries in one fell swoop. Investors and experts expect it to grow by 35x during presale and 100x once it lists on major exchanges. Early COLT investors have already gained 40% ROI, and this number is only set to increase due to COLT&rsquo;s strong foundation, doxxed team, and long-term roadmap!</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Lens released a beta version of its blockchain scaling solution, Bonsai, to address the concerning issue of scalability for decentralized social media platforms.&nbsp;</p>
Scaling Solutions For Web3 Social
<p>Lens Protocol, a Web3 social graph, has announced the launch of Bonsai, a new scaling solution designed to improve the user experience and facilitate mass adoption. Aave, the development firm responsible for the Lens Protocol, addressed the need to provide a seamless social media experience for its users by increasing scalability and reducing transaction costs.</p>
<p>Since shared blockchain networks can only process up to 200 transactions per second (TPS) and a major social media platform like Twitter often reaches 25,000 TPS during peak hours, it was necessary to launch a scalability solution that would help blockchain networks to up the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bonsai is an Optimistic Layer-3 (or a Polygon Layer-2) scaling solution that will process transactions at hyperscale and is designed to support the next generation of social media users. The solution also enables the processing of transactions at a much lower cost, making the platform more accessible to users with different financial capabilities.</p>
First Momoka, Then Bonsai
<p>The Bonsai solution comes just days after the release of Lens Protocol's previous scaling solution, Momoka, which enabled faster and cheaper transactions on the blockchain. Momoka was the first Layer 2 scaling solution for the platform and was designed to help Lens Protocol cope with its growing user base. The follow-up release of Bonsai indicates the company's commitment to continually improving its blockchain infrastructure to meet the needs of its users.</p>
<p>According to Aave CEO and the founder of Lens Protocol, Stani Kulechov,&nbsp;</p>

<p>"To be competitive with web2, decentralized social platforms must scale. With the ability to support mass consumer adoption, we'll see continued web3 innovation &mdash; new, exciting and compelling features and business models that will spur web3 adoption. Bonsai provides hyperscalability that supports blockchain's core values and guarantees, delivering secure, fast and cost-effective scalability."</p>

Aave&rsquo;s Bid For Scalability
<p>Blockchain-based social media platforms are gaining rapid popularity as they are a preferable alternative to centralized social media platforms for many users. The latter has come under scrutiny in recent years due to their subpar standards of data privacy and overall impact on society.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These blockchain-based social media platforms need scalability solutions to achieve censorship resistance and unlock content monetization schemes. Bonsai can store and process transactions off-chain to optimize cost and improve scalability while also keeping the data easily accessible and verifiable. It is, therefore, a prime time for Lens Protocol and its scalability solutions to become a leading player in the blockchain-based social media space.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Image source: Findora</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The privacy-focused Layer-1 blockchain Findora has announced what may well prove to be its most innovative product yet - a privacy-focused SDK that enables any Web3 developer to integrate zero-knowledge proofs into their decentralized applications and ensure complete transaction privacy for users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Findora Triple Masking SDK provides simple plug-and-play privacy for any Web3 dApp, with users able to choose to mask any aspect of a transaction, including the sender&rsquo;s and receiver&rsquo;s wallet addresses, the type of asset sent and the amount that was sent. It&rsquo;s fully configurable too, meaning users can choose exactly which elements of the transaction they wish to anonymize. So they can mask the amount sent, but keep the specific addresses or asset type sent public, if they desire to do so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where the Findora Triple Masking SDK really stands out however is with its integrated asset tracing capabilities. This ensures that anonymized transactions can still be viewed by regulators, meaning they remain fully auditable while being obscured from the public blockchain. This is a key capability that ensures full compliance with regulatory bodies, a key requirement for may institutional users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Findora said the need for crypto transaction privacy in Web3 is very real. Blockchain transactions are ostensibly anonymous, because only the seemingly random wallet addresses are publicly viewable. However, the reality is that many crypto addresses can be linked to users, especially if they have posted previous transaction information, such as their purchases of NFTs, on social media in the past. This means it is dangerous for many organizations to use crypto, especially those in regulated industries such as finance and healthcare, which are required by law to keep personally identifiable transaction information secret. As such, the risk of user&rsquo;s transaction data is too great for many organizations to adopt cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the dynamic that Findora wants to address with its Triple Masking SDK that effectively brings crypto into line with traditional banking. As the company explains, banks are required by law to ensure that all of their customer&rsquo;s financial transactions and accounts are kept private. Findora points out that consumer privacy is defined as the ability of users alone to control who can access their data, and says that this has, rightfully, been recognized by most governments in the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By enabling any Web3 dApp to integrate zero-knowledge proofs, Findora says it&rsquo;s bringing the same level of protection afforded to traditional banking customers to the world of crypto. ZK-Proofs, as they&rsquo;re known, make it possible to verify that a specific amount of a crypto asset has been sent to a wallet address without revealing the asset involved, the transaction amount, or the sender or recipient&rsquo;s address.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Triple Masking fulfills a promise that blockchain technology made years ago: your financial status, your financial future, is no longer in the hands of some unknown, so-called &ldquo;trusted&rdquo; third party,&rdquo; said Sam Harrison, CEO of Discreet Labs, the company behind Findora. &ldquo;This SDK simplifies the developer experience of implementing complicated zk-proofs, which in turn enables more decentralized applications to offer the benefits of these zk-proofs to their users.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harrison emphasized Findora Triple Masking SDK&rsquo;s novel asset tracing capabilities and the ability to comply with existing financial regulations. He stressed that this makes the offering entirely unique and of special interest to institutions. &ldquo;Triple Masking solves both the privacy and compliance requirements of a professional institution,&rdquo; he stated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Discreet Labs Chief Scientist Weikeng Chen said the Findora Triple Masking SDK relies on a specific type of ZK-Proof known as application-specific turbo-plonks, or zk-Snarks, which make it possible for asset transfers to be encrypted as cryptographic commitments, rather than the data being stored in plaintext. He said it works similarly to how a privacy coin like Zcash processes private transactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Findora Triple Masking has the ability to scale to support thousands of transactions per second, the company said. Other features include interoperability with &ldquo;elliptic curve signing algorithms&rdquo; such as ed25519 and secp256k1, which means developers can enable anonymous transactions between EVM standard wallets and privacy-preserving architectures such as Bitcoin&rsquo;s UTXO format. Another interesting capability is that the SDK can mask almost any asset class, including FRC20, FRC721 or FRC1155 assets, through its Prism++ transfer mechanism.</p>
<p>Compatibility with the secp256k1 curve also enables EVM wallets like MetaMask to sign anonymous transactions, Harrison said. &ldquo;While MetaMask may not be able to enable private transactions directly, [they] can be signed by MetaMask and handled by the applications directly,&rdquo; he stated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given its unique capabilities, Harrison expressed his confidence that the Findora Triple Masking SDK will emerge as the de facto universal privacy standard for Web3 transactions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Users tend to have a choice between privacy and convenience,&rdquo; he said, explaining that most will choose the latter over the former. &ldquo;I am excited to see what choices developers can offer their users when both privacy and convenience are attainable.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Google Cloud has announced a strategic partnership with Polygon Labs. The partnership will help developers to build, launch, and grow their decentralized applications (dApps) and Web3 products on the layer-2 blockchain.&nbsp;</p>
The Blockchain Node Engine Comes To Polygon&nbsp;
<p>The partnership will see Google Cloud bring its node hosting service, the Blockchain Node Engine, to the Polygon ecosystem. In a statement during the Consensus 2023, this will help developers on Polygon to build on the protocol and retain complete control over where nodes are deployed. Ryan Wyatt, Polygon President, added,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s announcement with Google Cloud aims to increase transaction throughput enabling use cases in gaming, supply chain management, and DeFi. This will pave the way for even more businesses to embrace blockchain technology through Polygon.&rdquo;</p>

Advancing Polygon&rsquo;s Zero-Knowledge Innovation Strategy&nbsp;
<p>According to Google Cloud, the partnership with Polygon will enable the protocol to grow, advance its zero-knowledge innovation strategy, and help make transactions cheaper and quicker. In a statement, Polygon stated that initial test runs running Polygon zkEVM&rsquo;s zero-knowledge proofs on Google Cloud presented faster and cheaper transactions when compared to the existing setup and infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Initial tests to run Polygon zkEVM&rsquo;s zero-knowledge proofs on Google Cloud, for instance, resulted in significantly faster and cheaper transactions as compared to the existing setup.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Polygon had announced the release of its zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) beta for the public only last month.&nbsp;</p>
Google&rsquo;s Push Into Web3&nbsp;
<p>Google has established itself as one of the most prominent players in the Web2 ecosystem. However, the tech behemoth has been actively making a push into the Web3 ecosystem over the past few years, bringing its technical expertise to developers on Polygon to build and launch its projects. Recently it launched a &ldquo;Google for Startups Cloud Program&rdquo; designed to support startups and emerging projects in the Web3 ecosystem, helping them scale their projects faster and more securely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier in the month, the Celo Foundation revealed that it was working with Google Cloud to offer cloud computing services and workshops to developers and Web3 founders building in the Celo ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mitesh Agarwal, the managing director of customer engineering and Web3 go-to-market, Asia Pacific of Google Cloud, stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Google Cloud is helping the industry achieve escape velocity by directing our engineering efforts toward areas like improving data availability and enhancing the resilience and performance of scaling protocols like zero-knowledge proofs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Google Cloud is the cloud computing arm of Google and had created its Web3 and digital assets engineering team only last year. Since its inception, Google Cloud has established multiple partnerships with a host of blockchains, including Casper, Celo, Tezos, Solana, Aptos, and BNB Chain.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Harmful advertisements proved to be a very profitable endeavour for scammers. ScamSniffer reveals that the average cost per click for related keywords ranges from $1 to $2. With a conversion rate of 40% from 7,500 consumers clicking on malicious ads, scammers have invested nearly $15,000 in advertising. A total of $4 million has been stolen thus far, translating into a return rate of 276%.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Belgian cryptocurrency trading platform Bit4You has announced the suspension of operations after it discovered that CoinLoan, one of its service providers, was declared insolvent by an Estonian court.&nbsp;</p>
The CoinLoan Insolvency&nbsp;
<p>The cryptocurrency trading platform learned about CoinLoan&rsquo;s insolvency issues on the 24th of April. According to a blog post published by the crypto lender, it learned that CoinLoan no longer had the necessary registration to qualify as a digital asset custodian. The blog post stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We would like to inform you that we recently learned that one of our major service providers, CoinLoan, based in Estonia, no longer has the required registration as custodian of virtual currencies. Following this, we immediately took several steps to understand the nature and scope of this situation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, Bit4you added that it does not have any reason to believe that the funds it held with CoinLoan would not be recovered.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were informed that a court decision of insolvency was issued against CoinLoan on Monday, the 24th of April 2023, in Estonia. However, to date, we have no indication that the virtual currencies held on behalf of our customers with CoinLoan will not be recovered, especially in view of the message published by CoinLoan on the 25th of April 2023.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Estonian authorities issued a stop order on the 24th of April, preventing CoinLoan from releasing assets in the absence of a &ldquo;temporary insolvency practitioner.&rdquo; In June 2022, CoinLoan had capped withdrawals at $5000 for 24 hours in an attempt to stave off a run on its funds following the collapse of the Terra ecosystem. CoinLoan published a message to its users stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Notice of restraint on disposition received yesterday, the 24th of April, 2023, obliges CoinLoan to halt all operations for its users, including withdrawals. This action is unexpected and has an immediate effect. As a result, we have no choice but to comply with the said requirements. We are doing everything in our power to resolve this situation as quickly as possible.&rdquo;</p>

Bit4You Assets On CoinLoan&nbsp;
<p>In an effort to ensure transparency and keep users in the loop, Bit4You listed out the assets and how much of them it had on CoinLoan. This includes 1097.5 ETH worth $2.1 million, 145 BTC worth $4.2 million, and 501 BNB worth around $166,00. Other assets Bit4You held on the platform include ADA, CLT, DOT, LINK, LTC, USDT, XLM, XRP, and XMR.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bit4You assured users that it was doing everything in its power to resolve the situation without risking any funds and protecting the interest of its clients.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Phantom, a Solana-based crypto wallet, is set to expand its support to include Ethereum and Polygon blockchains, opening its doors to a broader range of crypto users.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">According to Phantom, the feature for multichain support will have a public launch on May 1st. The public launch will place on May 1. The Web3 wallet has published an initial guide on how to import and manage multiple wallets natively on its web and mobile apps.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">With the integration, Phantom's multichain wallet will simplify the management of multiple Secret Recovery Phrases and private keys across Solana, Ethereum, and Polygon. Users may then import and use existing multichain addresses from popular wallets like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and Rainbow, eliminating the need for multiple wallets. Phantom allows for the creation and management of up to 100 accounts, enabling easy management of all Secret Recovery Phrases and private keys within a single platform.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Originally scheduled for launched in Q1 2023, the addition of Ethereum and Polygon support enables Phantom's 3 million users to transfer assets across different blockchains and interact with decentralized applications (dApps) such as Uniswap and Aave, as well as NFT marketplaces like Blur and OpenSea. Phantom wallet users can now also import existing assets from MetaMask, Solana, or Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) wallets.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Phantom's multichain support follows a successful funding round in January 2022, during which the wallet company reached a valuation of $1.2 billion. The round included participation from Paradigm, Andreessen Horowitz, Jump Capital, Solana, and other investors. The firm started with a $9 million Series A.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">While there are other multichain crypto wallets like Pillar in the market, the majority of crypto wallets typically cater to single layer-1 blockchains, with Ethereum-focused wallets being the most prevalent. MetaMask, for instance, supports Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens, but its team has expressed interest in a multichain future.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Web3 wallets play a crucial role in scaling the crypto ecosystem, as they provide users with a seamless, secure, and accessible interface for managing their digital assets. One of the main factors contributing to the growth of the crypto ecosystem is the rise of decentralized applications (dApps) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which have expanded the use cases for cryptocurrencies beyond just being a store of value or a medium of exchange.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Web3 wallets are thus critical in the ecosystem in that they enable users to interact with these dApps and NFT marketplaces, thus facilitating their participation in decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, and other sectors that are gaining traction within the crypto space.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Phantom Wallet CEO Brandon Millman has opined along the same trajectory, claiming that the nature of wallets in the crypto space is rapidly changing amid newly-discovered technical difficulties and regulatory concerns. Millman previously helped build Matcha.xyz, an Ethereum-based DEX aggregator, as well as APIs for 0x.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Phantom is also implementing new security features to mitigate phishing risks, including hiding spam sent to crypto wallets. The wallet simulates transactions before approval, allowing users to verify the transaction details and detect potential concerns. To date, Phantom has a user base of over 3 million.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Former senior technology and security executives from venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Riyaz Faizullabhoy and Nassim Eddequiouaq, have reportedly started an institutional-focused cryptocurrency custody firm.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The duo, who had held the positions of Chief Technology Officer and Chief Information Security Officer at a16z, have received the firm's blessing and seed backing for the new venture.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Before joining a16z, the tandem co-created the crypto custody infrastructure for Facebook's Novi (formerly Calibra) wallet. Calibra, introduced by Facebook in June 2019, was designed as a digital wallet to facilitate transactions using the proposed cryptocurrency Libra. The project faced significant backlash from regulators and policymakers, leading to the withdrawal of support from several founding members of the Libra Association. In December 2020, Facebook rebranded Calibra as Novi and the Libra Association changed its name to Diem Association, signaling a shift in focus.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The Diem Association redesigned the project into a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar and other major currencies, aiming to comply with regulatory requirements. Novi, as a digital wallet, supports Diem and other cryptocurrencies, providing users with a secure platform for digital asset transactions. Throughout Novi's development, security has been a top priority, with Nassim and Riyaz playing a significant role in building its crypto custody infrastructure.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Previously, a16z Crypto had onboarded Nassim and Riyaz to consult with projects in the a16z Crypto portfolio, helping scale the firm's operations. The pair ventured further into the crypto space at Anchorage, focusing on securing private keys within large distributed infrastructures. Institutional crypto custody is a competitive space, with various technologies available to manage cryptographic keys for hedge funds, asset managers, and banks.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Before their involvement with blockchain technologies, the duo met at Docker, where they worked on securing application provenance, authentication systems, and designing the secure OS used in Docker Desktop. Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of cloud applications by shaping containerized environments for cloud deployment. Containers are lightweight, portable units that allow developers to package an application along with its dependencies, such as libraries, configuration files, and runtime environment, making sure that an app runs consistently and predictably across different environments, regardless of the underlying infrastructure. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">With this experience, the two are now shifting their focus to building a new crypto custody firm, leveraging their expertise in blockchain security and engineering. Crypto custody is a crucial component of the blockchain ecosystem, offering secure storage and management of digital assets for institutional investors. With their solid background in crypto custody infrastructure development, Nassim and Riyaz are well-equipped to address the growing need for secure and reliable custody services in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape.</p>
