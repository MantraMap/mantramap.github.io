			            <description><![CDATA[XEC has surged the most from the top 100 digital assets, by adding 18% in a day. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After dipping to just over $30,000, bitcoin has reacted well and has spiked toward the coveted $31,000 line once more.</p>
<p>Most larger-cap altcoins are slightly in the red on a daily scale, aside from SOL and BCH, both of which have neared round-numbered milestones as well.</p>
<h2>BTC to Challenge $31K Again</h2>
<p>Last Friday turned out to be a highly unfavorable day for the BTC bulls as the asset slumped by $1,500 in minutes after the SEC issued a warning against the most recent filings for a spot Bitcoin ETF.</p>
<p>However, the cryptocurrency reacted well and recovered almost all losses by the time Saturday arrived. As it happens frequently during the weekends, this one was relatively calm, with BTC standing mostly at around $30,500.</p>
<p>Monday didn&#8217;t bring any more price fluctuations either, but the landscape <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-taps-31k-on-blackrocks-etf-refiling-aptos-jumps-10-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">changed</a> on early Tuesday when BTC pushed to $31,400. However, it failed there, and the subsequent <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/comp-mkr-aave-soar-triple-digits-weekly-btc-loses-31k-weekend-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">rejection</a> drove it south to $30,200 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the bulls seem to be back in charge now as they stopped bitcoin&#8217;s freefall and initiated another leg-up that has helped it touch $31,000 as of now.</p>
<p>As such, the asset&#8217;s market cap has reclaimed $600 billion once again, and its dominance over the alts has taken a breather and is close to 50%.</p>

Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>BCH on a Roll</h2>
<p>While BTC is trying its hand at taking down $31,000, several of the larger-cap alts are sitting quietly, mostly in the red. These include Ethereum, Binance Coin, Ripple, Cardano, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Polkadot, Polygon, and Shiba Inu, as all of them are down by up to 2% in a day.</p>
<p>Solana, on the other hand, has jumped by 3% and has neared $20. Bitcoin Cash has soared by 8% and sits close to $300. Recall that BCH <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-cash-explodes-33-to-14-month-high-solana-and-litecoin-soar-15-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">tapped</a> a 14-month high last week at over $320.</p>
<p>eCash has also been on a roll lately, having surged 18% in a day and over 60% in the past week.</p>
<p>In total, the crypto market cap has added just over $10 billion in a day and has gone back above $1.210 trillion on CMC.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Institutional investors are showing much more interest in Bitcoin derivatives and options contracts since BlackRock and several other firms filed for exchange-traded funds.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Professional traders are flocking back to Bitcoin funds in the wake of multiple applications for exchange-traded funds by leading asset managers.</p>
<p>As a result, open interest (OI) for options contracts has soared to $13.8 billion, according to blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the increase in demand for <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-btc-posts-2-consecutive-green-quarters-for-the-first-time-since-2021/" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a> options has pushed OI close to its all-time high of $15.1 billion, the firm added before commenting:</p>
<blockquote><p>“This suggests market investors are increasing their exposure to risk-defined derivative instruments.”</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">#Bitcoin</a> Options Contracts have experienced an increase in demand as Open Interest recently soared to a value of $13.8B, just $1.3B shy of the ATH of $15.1B.</p>
<p>This suggests market investors are increasing their exposure to risk-defined derivative instruments. <a href="https://t.co/vZyQQJtVvw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/vZyQQJtVvw</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Options Demand Surges</h2>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/for-the-first-time-bitcoin-options-open-interest-higher-than-futures-what-does-it-mean/" data-wpel-link="internal">Open interest</a> refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts that have not been settled. For each buyer of a futures or options contract, there must be a seller.</p>
<p>Options are similar to futures but do not have a fixed settlement date and have the ‘option’ to be renewed or extended.</p>
<p><a href="https://metrics.deribit.com/options/BTC" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">According</a> to Deribit, around $116 million in Bitcoin options are set to expire on July 6. However, this is a very small amount of options contracts compared to previous expiries. Around $1.7 billion options contracts are set to expire on July 28, which may have a bigger impact on markets.</p>
<p>It also noted that the put/call ratio for these contracts was 0.81. This means that there are slightly more calls than puts which is neutral but leaning to bullish.</p>
<p>The ratio is calculated by dividing the number of put (short) contracts by the number of call (long) contracts. Values lower than 1 are often considered bullish as more speculators are trading in long options contracts.</p>
<p>Bitcoin futures trading has also seen an uptick last month. According to data provided to the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission, the number of traders maintaining futures position of at least 25 BTC increased from a recent low of 94 at the end of May to 121 by the last week of June.</p>
<h2>Crypto Market Outlook</h2>
<p>Bitcoin derivatives may be in high demand, but spot markets are continuing to decline from their recent rally. Total capitalization is down 1.2% on the day to $1.23 trillion at the time of writing.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-price-analysis/" data-wpel-link="internal">BTC</a> has dropped 1.1% over the past 24 hours in a fall to $30,516 as it struggles to break heavy resistance. Meanwhile, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ethereum-price-analysis/" data-wpel-link="internal">ETH</a> has retreated a similar percentage to trade at $1,914 at the time of writing, according to CoinGecko.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The investigation launched by the CFTC in the wake of Celsius’ collapse has concluded, and a lawsuit may be in the wings.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three days after Celsius imploded on the 13th of July 2022, the CFTC, swiftly followed by the SEC, launched separate investigations into the crypto platform’s business practices.</p>
<p>The company was also investigated – and in some cases sued – separately by local <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/celsius-engaged-in-an-unregistered-securities-offering-alleged-vermonts-financial-regulator/" data-wpel-link="internal">authorities</a> in Vermont, New York, and elsewhere.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I&#8217;m suing the former CEO of cryptocurrency platform <a href="https://twitter.com/CelsiusNetwork?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@CelsiusNetwork</a> for defrauding investors out of billions of dollars.</p>
<p>Alex Mashinsky lied to people about the risks of investing in Celsius, hid its deteriorating financial condition, and failed to register in New York.</p>
<p>— NY AG James (@NewYorkStateAG) <a href="https://twitter.com/NewYorkStateAG/status/1611023481285578752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">January 5, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Charges brought against Celsius by the CFTC, however, would likely be federal.</p>
<h2>Celsius Misled Investors, Says Confidential CFTC Source</h2>
<p>The CFTC’s investigation has now concluded, and individuals within the organization have said that both Alex Mashinsky and his platform misled investors and ignored existing regulations, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-05/cftc-probe-concludes-crypto-lender-celsius-ex-ceo-mashinsky-broke-rules" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">according</a> to Bloomberg.</p>
<p>These allegations are aligned with those posited by NYAG Letitia James, who accused Mashinsky of deliberately making false claims regarding his firm’s financial situation to woo investors.</p>
<blockquote><p>“As the former CEO of Celsius, Alex Mashinsky promised to lead investors to financial freedom but led them down a path of financial ruin. The law is clear that making false and unsubstantiated promises and misleading investors is illegal. […] My office will stay vigilant and ensure that bad actors trying to take advantage of New York investors are held accountable.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In turn, Mashinsky retorted that the New York Attorney General “fundamentally misunderstood” both Celsius’ business model and the role he played as CEO.</p>
<p>However, the organization itself has so far refused to officially comment on the matter. The sources from within the organization also refrained from specifying which regulations Celsius and Mashinsky broke specifically, outside of failing to register with the relevant authorities.</p>
<h2>Lawsuit Possible by the End of July</h2>
<p>Now that the investigation has concluded, the CFTC will reportedly host an internal vote on what to do with the information they’ve uncovered.</p>
<p>If a majority of CFTC commissioners agree with the interpretation of the research teams’ findings, a federal lawsuit may be filed against Celsius and, very likely, against Mashinsky himself. According to the confidential source, the gavel may drop no later than the end of July, assuming nobody decides to play devil’s advocate within the Commission.</p>
<p>Should the case be brought before a federal court, it would be the latest in a series of over 85 cases filed by the CFTC concerning digital assets. So far, the agency has been the reason for over $4 billion in penalties and restitutions sourced from fraudulent crypto markets, said CFTC director Rostin Benham.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new Aave proposal took place to decide the fate of $3 million in the protocol&#8217;s treasury.</p>
<p>The holders of the Aave tokens will be voting on a governance proposal on whether 1,600 Ether, worth around $3 million, in the DeFi protocol treasury will be converted to wrapped staked ether (wstETH) and rocket pool ether (rETH).</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=261" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">proposal</a>, created on July 3rd, has received 252,152 affirmative votes out of a required 320,000 at the time of publication. Aave token holders have until July 7th to vote.</li>
<li>For the uninitiated, wrapped Staked Ether (WETH) and Rocket Pool Ether (rETH) are examples of staking derivatives that enable market participants to earn staking rewards.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Aave DAO currently holds 1,786.51 awETH (v2) and 104.548 units of ETH in the Collector Contract. The awETH deposit yield in Aave v2 earns 1.69%, relative to 3.8% with wstETH and 3.13% with rETH. This AIP converts all the unproductive ETH balance, along with aWETH (v2 and v3) into the same amounts of wstETH and rETH.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Aave&#8217;s native token, AAVE, has <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/aave-explodes-25-daily-eth-pushes-above-1-9k-market-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">recovered</a> significantly alongside the broader digital assets market over the past three weeks.</li>
<li>It was up by more than 22% over the past week alone and was currently trading at $74.95.</li>
<li>According to the latest <a href="https://defillama.com/protocol/aave?tvl=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">data</a> compiled by DefiLlama, Aave&#8217;s TVL increased by nearly 60% from $3.74 billion in January to the press time value of $5.98 billion.</li>
<li>While the recovery has been notable, Aave&#8217;a TVL was down by nearly 70% from its ATH of nearly $20 billion in October 2021.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[Crypto exchanges in South Africa could face enforcement action they fail to obtain a license with the country's financial regulator by the end of the year.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">South Africa&#8217;s financial regulator has asked exchanges operating in the country to obtain a license before the end of 2023.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Crypto firms who fail to adhere to the directive before the deadline could be fined or have their businesses closed down by authorities.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">New Licensing Regime in South Africa</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-04/south-africa-to-require-crypto-exchanges-licensing-by-year-end?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=crypto&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">required</a> crypto exchanges in South Africa to secure a license before the November 30 deadline.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to FSCA Commissioner Unathi Kamlana, about 20 firms have applied since the watchdog first opened the licensing process a few weeks ago, while expecting more companies to file an application before the deadline.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In October 2022, the FSCA <a href="https://www.fsca.co.za/Regulatory%20Frameworks/Temp/Policy%20Document%20supporting%20the%20Declaration%20of%20crypto%20assets%20as%20a%20financial%20product.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">declared</a> crypto a financial product after a declaration proposal in November 2022 and a consultation on the draft regulation. Also, the publication of the final declaration mentioned that crypto exchanges in South Africa must be licensed by the end of 2023. Defaulters could be fined 10 million rands ($536,387), face 10 years in prison, or suffer both consequences.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While the FSCA proposed a four-month window for crypto businesses to submit their license applications, some commentators believed the time frame was insufficient, with some comments suggesting six months and another two years. The financial watchdog, in response, extended the license application period to six months in the final declaration, stating that it was not necessary and unjustified.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">South Africa&#8217;s High-Profile Crypto Scams</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The South African regulator, meanwhile, maintains that the crypto asset industry is risky, with Kamlana stating that &#8220;it is an area where you can lose quite a bit of money, so you must think twice before exposing yourself to it.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The African country, which has seen an increased interest in the asset class, has also experienced some high-profile cryptocurrency scams causing investors losses worth billions of dollars. In June 2021, the founders of South African crypto investment platform Africrypt, the Cajee brothers, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/a-major-crypto-scam-in-south-africa-two-brothers-and-69000-btc-have-vanished-together/" data-wpel-link="internal">allegedly made away</a> with nearly 70,000 BTC (worth over $2 billion).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Also, Johannes Steynberg, CEO of the international multi-level marketing scheme Mirror Trading International (MTI), reportedly disappeared with 29,000 bitcoin in customer funds. Following his <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/man-behind-29000-bitcoin-ponzi-scam-is-arrested-in-brazil/" data-wpel-link="internal">arrest</a> in Brazil, a US court recently <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/south-african-ceo-ordered-to-pay-a-record-3-4-billion-penalty-in-cftc-bitcoin-fraud-case/" data-wpel-link="internal">ordered</a> Steynberg to pay a penalty worth $3.4 billion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Kamlana further said the FSCA introduced consumer protection measures which include awareness about crypto products and financial education.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to the FSCA Commissioner:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;There is potentially serious harm to financial customers when using crypto products, and therefore it makes sense for us to introduce the regulatory framework. Time will tell the effectiveness of our measures, and we will continue to work together with the industry to refine and make changes where and if necessary.”</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two teenage boys from Hamilton, Ontario, have been busted for allegedly stealing over $4 million worth of bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) from an American man through what authorities described as a &#8220;spear phishing attack.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/crypto-teens-charged-1.6896349" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">local reports</a>, Hamilton police started working with the United States Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and the Secret Service Electronic Crimes Task Force to investigate the boys in June 2023.</p>
<h2>A Spear Phishing Attack</h2>
<p>Const. Krista-Lee Ernst of the Hamilton police noted that the boys, both 17 years old, used a spear phishing attack to deceive their victim into giving them $4.2 million in crypto.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-giveaway-twitter-scam-caused-by-a-phone-spear-phishing-attack/" data-wpel-link="internal">A spear phishing attack</a> is a targeted form of phishing used by scammers to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, or other personal data. Unlike traditional phishing attacks that cast a wide net, spear phishing attacks are highly personalized and tailored to specific individuals or organizations.</p>
<p>In a spear phishing attack, the bad actor conducts thorough research to gather information about the target, such as their name, position, company, colleagues, or even personal details from social media platforms. With such information, the scammer can craft compelling and customized emails or messages that appear to be from a trusted source, such as a colleague, supervisor, or a reputable organization the target is associated with.</p>
<p>In the case of the Hamilton teens, the duo, known by their fake aliases &#8220;Felon&#8221; and &#8220;Gaze,&#8221; pretended to be members of the support team of the popular American crypto exchange Coinbase. They aimed to take over the man&#8217;s crypto account on the exchange.</p>
<h2>Over $13 Million Seized</h2>
<p>After successfully gaining control of the account, the boys were able to access the man&#8217;s digital assets stored on the platform.</p>
<p>According to the police, the teens spent some of the funds to purchase the Instagram username &#8220;@zombie,&#8221; a rare username in the gaming community. Police also seized at least $13.4 million worth of digital assets after they were caught.</p>
<p>Although authorities initially arrested both teens, only one was charged with theft of over $5,000 and possession of property or proceeds acquired through criminal means, while the other was released.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The inception of blockchain technology started a revolutionary wave of disruptive innovation across many industries, transforming the way we perceive, interact with, and conduct business. With its robust security, decentralization, and smart contract functionalities, blockchain&#8217;s reach goes beyond the conventional financial and supply chain sectors to many other industries — like real estate, healthcare, and, notably, betting.</p>
<p>Enter the world of Chancer, a new entrant that is leveraging the unparalleled potential of blockchain to catapult the betting industry into the future. The Chancer presale is now live, offering a golden opportunity for those who recognize the massive potential this innovative platform holds.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258561" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1.png" alt="Picture1" width="468" height="234" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1.png 468w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-300x150.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-50x25.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px" /></a></p>
<h2>Why is Blockchain so Important for Betting?</h2>
<p>The betting industry has often been criticized for its lack of transparency, questionable fairness, and the influence of a central authority, but with the advent of blockchain, these industry problems are being rectified. This technology, characterized by its transparent, secure, and decentralized nature, is an ideal fit for betting scenarios. It ensures fairness, reduces the potential for manipulation, and promises enhanced user trust — aspects that have been missing from traditional betting systems.</p>
<p>The Kelbie brothers, founders of Chancer, have astutely recognized these opportunities, and their project has arrived just as the blockchain revolution is gathering momentum, placing them in a prime position to reshape the betting industry. Chancer, with its innovative concept of a decentralized predictions market, is demonstrating the enormous transformative power of blockchain.</p>
<p>This presale phase represents an opportunity for investors and tech enthusiasts alike to join the blockchain revolution, specifically in the world of betting. As experts delve deeper into the nature of Chancer, they are discovering its unique approach to betting and its potential, showing why this platform is set to shake things up.</p>
<h2>What is Chancer?</h2>
<p><a href="https://chancer.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=cryptopotato" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Chancer</a> is an innovative, decentralized predictive markets app and is making waves in the fast-paced blockchain revolution. This platform is revolutionizing the world of crypto by introducing the concept of a decentralized predictions market to a global audience, and by doing so, Chancer is shaking up the betting industry and empowering users with the freedom to create their own betting markets.</p>
<p>In a departure from the traditional betting house model, Chancer allows its users to participate in and create custom betting scenarios. These scenarios can range from predictions on globally significant events, such as the World Cup or the US presidential elections, to smaller personal wagers within your social group. This unconventional and disruptive approach sets Chancer apart and paves the way for a fair and unbiased betting environment.</p>
<p>The peer-to-peer (P2P) nature of Chancer eliminates the need for a traditional bookmaker, creating an environment where all users have equal opportunities and, with plans to transition into a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), Chancer becomes even more enticing for investors, especially during the current presale phase.</p>
<h2>How Does Chancer Work?</h2>
<p>At the core of the Chancer platform is CHANCER, the utility token that drives all transactions within the ecosystem. Users place their bets using CHANCER tokens and when they win, their winnings are also paid out in CHANCER, exemplifying its user-friendly design with this streamlined process.</p>
<p>As the Chancer platform gains traction and attracts more users to its novel betting model, the demand for CHANCER tokens is expected to increase. This surge in demand during the platform&#8217;s expansion phase creates an environment ripe for potential token price growth, so investors who participate in the Chancer presale could see massive returns as user numbers start to increase.</p>
<p>The journey towards becoming a DAO aims to add incentives for CHANCER holders, as they will be granted voting rights in proportion to their token holdings, allowing them to influence the platform&#8217;s future through proposals and votes on key decisions. This additional benefit is designed to encourage the long-term holding of CHANCER tokens.</p>
<p>In the crowded arena of crypto investments, CHANCER presents a compelling case. The buzz surrounding the Chancer presale reflects the growing recognition of its potential.</p>
<h2>Can CHANCER Lead the Blockchain Betting Revolution?</h2>
<p>The Chancer project has made a compelling entry into the blockchain betting arena and,, with its innovative use of blockchain technology, Chancer has introduced an element of transparency and creativity that looks set to reshape the betting industry.</p>
<p>While the platform has demonstrated its potential, its ability to sustain momentum and adapt to an ever-evolving market will be crucial, but with such a skilled team in place, early users seem likely to have a fantastic journey ahead of them.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Addresses holding less than 1 BTC are stacking sats at a record pace relative to the asset’s USD price.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin (BTC)’s smallest holders are deploying money into the asset at a record pace this month, reflecting a sense of shared optimism across the Bitcoin market in 2023.</p>
<p>On-chain data shows that “shrimps” – Bitcoin addresses holding less than 1 BTC – haven’t accumulated this aggressively in nearly six years.</p>
<h2>Small Holders Stack Their Sats</h2>
<p>According to Lead Glassnode Analyst James Check on Twitter, shrimps are currently <a href="https://twitter.com/_Checkmatey_/status/1676498354359111681" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">accumulating</a> an average of 33,800 BTC per month. That’s more than the number of new BTC issued by the network each month, which is 27,000 BTC.</p>
<blockquote><p>“For every 1 new coin, Shrimp are taking 1.25 off the market,” wrote Check. “Crazy conviction on display.”</p></blockquote>
<p>https://twitter.com/_Checkmatey_/status/1676498354359111681</p>
<p>In BTC terms, the fastest accumulation phase for shrimps remains the post-FTX-panic period, when Bitcoin’s price dropped to a 4-year low of $15,500. However, in dollar terms, Check noted that Shrimps are buying Bitcoin at the fastest rate seen since the peak of the 2017 bull market.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Five years later, they are stacking harder, faster, and in a more sustained manner, despite all the bullshit,” he continued. “Bullish.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, Bitcoin “crabs” – entities holdings between 1 and 10 BTC – are gathering an additional 22,400 BTC per month, making for another 83% of the mined supply. In May 2023, the number of addresses holding over 1 BTC <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/nearly-1-million-blockchain-addresses-now-hold-over-1-bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">surpassed</a> 1 million for the first time.</p>
<p>Comparisons to mined supply are relevant for those who believe Bitcoin’s halving – an event that cuts Bitcoin’s supply issuance rate in half every four years – is chiefly responsible for the asset’s notorious 4-year price cycle.</p>
<p>The next halving occurs in April 2024 – though some analysts <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/how-much-money-does-it-take-to-moon-bitcoin-analysis/" data-wpel-link="internal">don’t believe</a> it will necessarily catalyze another bull market.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin’s Bullish Indicators</h2>
<p>In prior reports this year, Glassnode analysts have pointed to an “ongoing transfer of wealth from investors with high time preferences towards HODLers.” According to the firm, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-hodlers-increase-at-a-record-pace-santiment/" data-wpel-link="internal">over 50%</a> of all BTC in circulation hadn’t changed hands in over two years as of this April.</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s price may be reflecting some of these shifting undercurrents, having appreciated 83% this year, and <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-dominance-soars-to-2-year-high-as-btc-maintains-26k-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">reclaimed</a> crypto market dominance above 50%.</p>
<p>Analysts are granting the market <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/will-the-sec-approve-a-bitcoin-spot-etf-in-2023-lawyer-breaks-down-the-odds/" data-wpel-link="internal">significant odds</a> of getting a Bitcoin Spot ETF past the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this year, which is expected to welcome more money into the asset.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[While still supporting other cryptos, CZ said he has a personal passion for Bitcoin.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) explained on Wednesday why Binance spends time supporting cryptocurrencies and blockchains beyond those it chiefly develops.</p>
<p>While the executive remained optimistic about the BNB Chain ecosystem, he said that he personally is a “heavy promoter of Bitcoin (BTC).”</p>
<h2>Are Binance’s Blockchain Centralized?</h2>
<p>In an <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1YpKkgZnELjKj?s=20" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">AMA</a> hosted over Twitter on Wednesday, a questioner raised concerns that the “Binance Blockchain” isn’t being promoted by its namesake company and that many crypto users view it as a “shitcoin.”</p>
<p>CZ explained that Binance would prefer that its many child networks – including BNB Beacon Chain, BNB Smart Chain, and an upcoming “greenfield” chain – remain independent, and decentralized.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Anything associated with Binance is often accused, wrongly, of being too centralized,” he said. “We’re caught in between. We could give a lot more support, or we could let them run on their own.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The “decentralization” of Binance’s blockchains came under scrutiny last year after Binance Smart Chain (BSC) was hacked for $600 million in BNB. The network <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/binance-smart-chain-paused-following-600-million-bnb-hack-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">collaborated</a> with roughly a dozen service providers to freeze the blockchain and stop any more money from escaping at the time, thanking them for their “quick and attentive response.”</p>

<h2>Bitcoin as a Safe Haven</h2>
<p>Amid such scrutiny, CZ said Binance prefers letting such networks be &#8220;independent&#8221; and treating “all blockchains on an equal basis” from the perspective of its exchange business.</p>
<p>“We promote Ethereum. I promote Bitcoin very heavily myself,” said CZ, while still voicing support for BNB – Binance’s native exchange token.</p>
<p>Earlier in the discussion, the executive noted that “blockchain technology” is used worldwide for both fundraising and as a “safe haven asset” by a “dedicated group of people,” possibly numbering in the hundreds of millions. “Especially Bitcoin,” he added, “[and] some of the top crypto assets.”</p>
<p>Demand for Bitcoin surged in March withdrawal panic swept across the major regional banks in the United States, indicating some level of market recognition for Bitcoin as an insurance policy against macroeconomic failures. The asset’s correlation to stocks tapped a two-year low in June.</p>

<p>Last month, Binance <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/keep-building-binance-starts-running-bitcoin-lightning-network-nodes/" data-wpel-link="internal">confirmed</a> that it is setting up nodes to support Bitcoin’s layer 2 lightning network. The nodes will help facilitate cheaper and fast BTC withdrawals from the exchange.</p>
