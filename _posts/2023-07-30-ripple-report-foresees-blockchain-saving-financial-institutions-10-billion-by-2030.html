Approximately 97% are confident that blockchain technology will be instrumental in expediting payment processes over the upcoming three years This widely-held conviction underscores the positive outlook toward blockchain, indicating a readiness to welcome its disruptive capabilities. A Catalyst For Cost-Efficiency In Cross-Border Transactions? Furthermore, the report highlights the cost-saving potential of cryptocurrencies. More than half of the respondents agreed that cryptocurrencies could significantly reduce payment costs, both domestically and internationally. The report predicts that blockchain&#8217;s application in global transactions could save financial institutions an estimated $10 billion in cross-border payment costs by 2030, substantiated by findings from fintech analysis firm, Juniper Research. With the rapid growth of e-commerce and businesses looking to penetrate international markets, the report anticipates a surge in cross-border payments. It estimates global cross-border payment flows could reach roughly $156 trillion by 2030, buoyed by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5%. Despite the optimistic views, the survey revealed a divide in opinions regarding the timeline for widespread merchant adoption of digital currency payments. About 50% of the respondents were optimistic about significant merchant adoption within the next three years. However, predictions varied for the likelihood of adoption within the next year, with the Middle East and African regions exhibiting the most confidence and Asia-Pacific the least.
