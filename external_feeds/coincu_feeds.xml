<p>&#8220;Inflation is projected to come down significantly this year,&#8221; said the Bank Of Canada <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2023/01/fad-press-release-2023-01-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in its policy statement</a>. &#8220;If economic developments evolve broadly in line with the [bank&#8217;s] outlook, Governing Council expects to hold the policy rate at its current level while it assesses the impact of the cumulative interest rate increases.&#8221;</p>



<p>Bitcoin (BTC), which was down for the day and experienced a general sell-off in risky assets, didn&#8217;t respond much to the BoC&#8217;s dovish announcement, but this might be a bullish move. The Bank Of Canada began a series of aggressive rate hikes in 2022, similar to the <strong>U.S. Federal Reserve, in an effort to slow down rapidly rising inflation.</strong></p>



<p>The terrible bear market for bitcoin last year, which saw the price plummet from just shy <strong>of $50,000 to roughly $15,000 before closing 2022 around $16,500</strong>, was significantly influenced by this dramatically tighter monetary policy by the<strong> Fed, BoC, and other western central banks.</strong></p>



<p>Similar to the BoC, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the Fed meets the next week and is anticipated to raise interest<strong> rates by only 25 basis points (versus 50 basis points at the previous meeting and 75 prior to that)</strong>. If the FOMC pleasantly revealed that it also intended to suspend its rate hiking program, the crypto markets would be far less inclined to ignore that information.</p>

<p>According to an announcement from Spatial Labs, Blockchain Capital led the round, with current investment Marcy Venture Partners, the venture firm co-founded by rapper Jay-Z, also participating. <strong>Spatial Labs&#8217; total fundraising now exceeds $14 million, including a $4 million pre-seed deal last year.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Spatial Labs&#8217; funding took place amid a backdrop of deteriorating crypto markets</strong>. According to Iddris Sandu, the business&#8217;s 25-year-old founder and CEO, the startup began seeking funds in mid-2022 and finished the equity round by December.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/06/black-founders-still-raised-just-1-of-all-vc-funds-in-2022" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/06/black-founders-still-raised-just-1-of-all-vc-funds-in-2022" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crunchbase statistics</a>,<strong> just approximately 1% of venture capital financing went to firms with Black founders in 2022</strong>, making this deal remarkable as a rare piece of cash for a Black entrepreneur in the United States. Sandu believes he is the first Black founder under 30 to raise a seed round in the tens of millions of dollars.</p>



<p><strong>Spatial Labs intends to expand its workforce and produce new products</strong> with additional money. Sandu currently employs about 25 people, and he hopes to double that number by the end of the year.</p>

<p>Sandu, who was born in Ghana and reared in the United States, <strong>created Spatial Labs in 2020 with the goal of improving customer experiences with blockchain-enabled technologies</strong>. Spatial Labs creates software and hardware platforms that bring companies and customers together. </p>



<p>In May 2022, the company released its first product, <strong>LNQ (pronounced &#8220;link&#8221;). LNQ</strong> is a chip that authenticates things and creates &#8220;digital twins,&#8221; or virtual replicas of actual objects, using Polygon&#8217;s blockchain technology.</p>

<li><em>Elizabeth Warren said the SEC has fought to safeguard investors from crypto products and has blocked bitcoin exchange-traded funds from entering the market.</em></li>

<p>After former President Donald Trump&#8217;s regulators allowed it to explode, <strong>Gensler, who took over the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2021, has had to put the genie back in the bottle and bring the crypto ecosystem into regulatory compliance</strong>, the senator said Wednesday in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OnR2qHvmVA" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OnR2qHvmVA" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview </a>with the American Economic Liberties Project.</p>



<p><strong>The SEC has fought to safeguard investors from crypto products and has blocked bitcoin exchange-traded funds from entering the market</strong>, according to Warren, who has been a prominent opponent of the sector, notably the environmental effect of cryptocurrency mining. </p>



<p>She also lauded the commission&#8217;s enforcement operations against celebrity cryptocurrency supporters like <strong>Kim Kardashian</strong> and cryptocurrency exchanges like <strong>Coinbase</strong> (COIN) for suspected insider trading.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">And, most importantly, it appears that the commission is still ramping up. That&#8217;s why the industry is scared of a strong SEC. And that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s spending millions of dollars each year lobbying to escape SEC oversight.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">The SEC should double down and use its tools to enforce the rules, and where the SEC needs more cops on the beat, then Congress needs to step up with the resources and the new authorities that are needed to make sure the SEC can do its work at full strength in every corner of the crypto market.</p>

<p>According to Deribit Chief Legal, Compliance and Regulatory Officer <strong>David Dohmen</strong>, the exchange, which has had its headquarters in Panama since 2020, intends to create an office in <strong>Dubai</strong> with a workforce of 10 individuals made up of both new local hires and the company&#8217;s current skills. The transfer may happen as soon as this summer.</p>



<p>Some employees&#8217; places of employment will remain in <strong>Panama</strong>. <strong>95 individuals </strong>are presently employed worldwide by the main business of Deribit, a Dutch company, and its affiliated subsidiaries, which is approximately twice as many as in <strong>2012</strong>.</p>



<p>After the collapse of the now-defunct derivatives exchange <a href="https://news.coincu.com/161640-sam-bankman-fried-forfeited-700m/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX</a>, the company made the decision to apply for a license in Dubai as part of a larger effort to boost trust in its exchange. The company also intends to hire one of the top four auditing firms and to regularly provide pictures of its evidence of reserves.</p>

<p class="has-small-font-size">“We’ve had a number of clients who basically intimated to us that they would like to trade on a crypto exchange that’s actually regulated.

<p>According to <strong>Luuk</strong> <strong>Strijers</strong>, the chief commercial officer of Deribit, the company is currently attempting to hire a reputable auditor. Despite being damaged by the failure of the hedge fund <strong>Three Arrows Capital</strong>, the company was profitable in 2022, he claimed.</p>



<p>In order to attract additional clients to the exchange, <strong>Deribit</strong> plans to get broker licenses in nations including the <strong>UK, Brazil</strong>, and <strong>Singapore</strong> in the coming years, according to <strong>Dohmen</strong>.</p>



<p>For cryptocurrency companies looking for friendlier treatment from authorities during the market collapse, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/127875-dubai-hosts-events-for-global-tech/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dubai</a> has positioned itself as a forward-thinking center. The emirate has awarded licenses to several cryptocurrency exchanges, including <strong>Binance</strong>, <strong>Bybit</strong>, and <strong>Komainu</strong>.</p>



<p>As it struggles to recover from a recession in the housing market that has hurt its renowned real estate industry, the construction-focused city has been working to draw more cryptocurrency firms. The emirate <a href="https://news.coincu.com/110345-dubai-with-metaverse-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduced</a> a metaverse program during the summer with the goal of bringing <strong>40,000 virtual employees </strong>and more than <strong>1,000 blockchain</strong> and metaverse companies to the city by <strong>2030</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Grey</strong> said that a deal had been inked earlier in the week when speaking at <strong>Quantum</strong> <strong>Miami</strong>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“It’s a new play for us. We’re working hand-in-hand with them on what developer resources need to be allocated from their side for Sushi to leverage what they’ve built so that we can provide value, as a brand, back to them.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to Grey, <strong>Sei Network</strong>, a brand-new Layer 1 blockchain that focuses exclusively on decentralized trading apps, is focused on having an order book and matching engine in its consensus layer.</p>



<p>One of the biggest non-Ethereum-based blockchains, <strong>Sei</strong> is a part of the <a href="https://news.coincu.com/138446-cosmos-hub-opened-voting-cosmos-2-0-atom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cosmos</a> ecosystem and enables developers to create specialized chains for certain purposes. <strong>Sushiswap</strong> intends to build its ecosystem while collaborating with the protocol.</p>

<p><a href="https://news.coincu.com/161134-sushiswap-lays-out-2023-focused-dex-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sushiswap</a> will enter non-Ethereum ecosystems and a different area of decentralized finance as a result of the shift. The new exchange might have an influence on Sushiswap&#8217;s tokenomics strategy and create a new source of revenue for the protocol. The decentralized exchange <a href="https://news.coincu.com/162231-sushiswap-is-given-permission-return-6-2-m/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">passed</a> a governance proposal earlier this week to update its tokenomics in an effort to divert value back to its native token, <strong>SUSHI</strong>.</p>



<p>As part of its earlier bigger objectives to make the protocol viable and lucrative, Sushiswap will place a strong emphasis on DEX products this year. In particular, the firm&#8217;s objective is to become a market-leading DEX by enhancing its product stack and achieving feature parity to give a solid platform for innovation, such as biased LP routes via aggregation router and focused liquidity, which will be available in Q1 2023.</p>

<p>With more than <strong>213 million unique addresses</strong> and <strong>over 2.5 million token transfers w</strong>orth hundreds of millions of dollars every day, <strong>Polygon</strong> represents one of the most significant blockchain ecosystems. All of these transactions will soon be accessible for analysis through <strong>Arkham</strong>.</p>



<p>Along with <a href="https://news.coincu.com/162095-ethereums-shanghai-upgrade-programmers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a>, which it will offer support for in the first quarter, this is the second chain <strong>Arkham</strong> <strong>Intelligence</strong> will add support for. Because of Polygon&#8217;s affiliations with<strong> Disney, Starbucks</strong>, and <strong>Stripe</strong>, as well as its substantial user base,<strong> </strong>the company said it picked <strong>Polygon</strong> for its second integration.</p>

<p><strong>Arkham</strong> stated having several chains <strong>integrated into its platform &#8220;opens new possibilities for on-chain research&#8221;</strong> and that it expects to offer support for other blockchains in the future. For data analytics platforms to reach a larger audience, support for other blockchains is crucial.</p>



<p>Last year, <strong>Arkham</strong> <strong>Intelligence</strong> launched private beta testing for its platform. To airdrop its <strong>ARKM</strong> <strong>token</strong>, it presently permits whitelisted users to post referral links.</p>



<p>On-chain research is now more accessible thanks to Arkham&#8217;s integration of several chains into a single platform. Users will be able to track a single entity&#8217;s activity across many chains, providing a more thorough picture of their existence in the crypto space. </p>



<p>As the world of blockchain becomes more complicated, the company&#8217;s capacity to examine labeled entities, transaction-level data, aggregated analysis, flows of funds, counterparty networks, warnings for any specified behavior, and a data-enriched block explorer adds cohesiveness and clarity.</p>

<p>In an event titled<strong> Confronting the Crypto Challenge: Learning From a Meltdown,</strong> organized by the <strong>American Economic Liberties Project </strong>on Wednesday, <strong>Warren</strong> argued for more regulation of the crypto company. The gathering included the most eminent crypto opponents in Washington, D.C., from legal experts to progressive policy experts.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“For all their talk of innovation and financial inclusion, crypto industry giants — from FTX to Celsius to Voyager — are collapsing under the weight of their own fraud, deceit and gross mismanagement. And when they sink, they take a lot of honest investors down with them,” she said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The crash of <a href="https://news.coincu.com/161640-sam-bankman-fried-forfeited-700m/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX</a> in November set off a chain reaction that is now spreading across the highly unregulated and opaque crypto marketplaces. On Wednesday, <strong>Warren</strong> urged regulators, such as the <strong>Securities and Exchange Commission</strong> <strong>(SEC)</strong> and banking agencies, to strengthen their use of the instruments at their disposal. According to her, they must work to safeguard customers, inform investors, and pursue &#8220;meaningful consequences&#8221; for wrongdoers.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“The SEC has a long history of fighting exactly the battles that we now face.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The history of the SEC towards cryptocurrencies was highlighted, notably the efficiency of Chair <strong>Gary Gensler</strong>. Director of research of the American Economic Liberties Project, <strong>Matt</strong> <strong>Stoller</strong>, stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“There is a smear campaign against Gensler right now from the industry trying to blame Gensler for what the industry did.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Participants at the event pressed for the <a href="https://news.coincu.com/157936-federal-reserve-warns-banks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Federal Reserve</a> to launch its real-time payments system, which has had many delays. If such a system were to work, it would refute the claim made by the cryptocurrency sector that digital assets can speed up transactions.</p>

<p>At 1:49 p.m. EST, <strong>CirrusNFT</strong>, a Twitter user, first spotted the outflow. At 2:02 p.m., <strong>Rose</strong> personally acknowledged the breach on Twitter.

<p>Rose&#8217;s wallet&#8217;s OpenSea transaction history reveals that various NFTs, including<strong> Cool Cats, Squiggles</strong>, and <strong>OnChainMonkeys</strong>, were taken.</p>



<p>Rose&#8217;s NFTs appear to have been stolen by the <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xbe659b2fc06e6d54705acbbd1d931cf703043802#tokentxnsErc721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hacker&#8217;s address</a>. It is believed that Rose signed a fraudulent signature that gave the exploiter access to a substantial percentage of his NFT assets, causing his NFTs to be drained.</p>



<p>The exploiter took at least one Autoglyph, which has a floor price of <strong>345 ETH, 25 Art Blocks,</strong> commonly known as <strong>Chromie</strong> <strong>Squiggle</strong>, valued at least a total of <strong>332.5 ETH</strong>, and nine <strong>OnChainMonkey</strong> products, each worth at least <strong>7.2 ETH</strong>, according to an independent study by <strong>Arkham</strong>. Rose preserved a few NFTs by storing them in a different vault.</p>

<p><strong>Arran</strong> <strong>Schlosberg</strong>, the vice president of PROOF, claimed that <strong>Rose</strong> <strong>was phished into signing a malicious signature,</strong> which let the exploiter move over a significant amount of tokens, despite the fact that numerous independent on-chain evaluations had been shared:</p>

<p>On <strong>January 25</strong>, cryptocurrency analyst <strong>foobar</strong> provided further details on the technical aspect of the hack, saying that Rose gave his approval for a contract with the <strong>OpenSea</strong> marketplace that would relocate all of his NFTs whenever Rose completed transactions.</p>
