<p>Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of USDC stablecoin operator Circle, believes stablecoins could help the Chinese government internationalize the yuan more quickly than its central bank digital currency (CBDC) eCNY. Although there is no indication that Beijing is warming up to crypto, Allaire thinks that stablecoins typically pegged to fiat currency, could be a more immediate solution to promote the use of the RMB in trade and commerce worldwide. He cited an offshore yuan-pegged stablecoin as an example of how this might work.</p>



<p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has promised to roll out regulations on stablecoins by 2024, recognizing the potential impact that these products could have on financial markets. In tandem, the Securities and Futures Commission is also working on its complementary regulations. This marks the next front in Hong Kong&#8217;s bid to regulate crypto markets and become a global virtual asset hub.</p>



<p>Stablecoins are a unique breed of crypto assets, pegged to fiat currency, making them more stable than other cryptocurrencies. They can be used for a variety of purposes, including remittances, cross-border payments, and trading. It remains to be seen whether stablecoins will take over CBDCs in promoting the use of cryptocurrencies, but they are gaining traction in the global market for now.</p>



<p>Despite the potential benefits, there are still concerns over their regulation and risks. The HKMA&#8217;s move to regulate stablecoins is a step in the right direction toward addressing these issues. As the crypto market continues to evolve, it is important for regulators to keep pace with new developments and provide a framework for the responsible use of these assets.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The FCA crackdown against crypto ATMs in the UK has reached 34 sites inspected in 2022, with 26 machines operating unlawfully.</em></li>



<li><em>One member of the public lost Â£1,000 when a machine said the transaction was unsuccessful and no funds were returned.</em></li>



<li><em>The FCA warns that crypto ATMs in the UK are operating illegally and consumers will not be protected if they use one and something goes wrong, such as falling victim to a scam.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Financial Conduct Authority (<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.fca.org.uk/" rel="noreferrer noopener">FCA</a>) against crypto ATMs in the U.K. has been ongoing since March 2022. </strong></h5>

<p>As of May and June, another 18 sites were inspected, bringing the total number of inspections for the year to 34. The regulator has been working closely with the South West Regional Organized Crime Unit and the police forces of Greater London, Bedfordshire, and Hertfordshire to conduct these inspections.</p>



<p>According to the FCA, it has &#8220;disrupted&#8221; 26 machines operating unlawfully across the country. However, despite the crackdown and warnings issued by the FCA, some members of the public continue to use crypto ATMs. In one case, a person paid 1,000 British pounds ($1,290) into a crypto ATM, but no funds were returned even though the machine said the transaction was unsuccessful.</p>

<p>The public to be aware that any crypto ATMs in the country are operating illegally, and consumers will not be protected if they use one and something goes wrong. The FCA has issued various warnings since March 2022, urging people not to use these machines.</p>



<p>None of the more than 40 registered crypto companies in the U.K. is licensed to offer ATM services. Therefore, any crypto ATMs operating in the U.K. are doing so illegally, as the FCA has warned. According to data site Coin ATM Radar, there are 10 such locations in the country.</p>



<p>The FCA&#8217;s crackdown on these illegal crypto ATMs is crucial to protect consumers from scams and ensure that financial regulations are being followed. Furthermore, it&#8217;s important for members of the public to be informed and aware of the risks associated with using these machines, and to avoid using them altogether.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Bitcoin Ordinals gain traction and challenge Ethereum&#8217;s NFT dominance, setting record numbers of inscriptions.</em></li>



<li><em>Ordinals experience a surge in sales and active buyers, with significant growth in USD sales and a potential shift in dominance within the NFT sector.</em></li>



<li><em>Ethereum&#8217;s struggle to maintain traction is attributed to falling floor prices of top collections, while Bitcoin Ordinals continue to gain adoption despite controversies.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitcoin Ordinals, the NFTs created on the Bitcoin (BTC) network, are rapidly gaining momentum and closing in on their Ethereum (ETH) counterparts in terms of dominance. Since their inception in April 2023, Ordinals have been making waves within the Bitcoin community, setting record numbers of inscriptions and challenging Ethereum&#8217;s position in the NFT space.</strong></h5>

<p>Ordinals are unique digital assets inscribed on a satoshi, the smallest unit of Bitcoin. Their creation became possible through the Taproot upgrade, which was launched on the Bitcoin network in November 2021. This upgrade enabled data inscription on the Bitcoin network in a similar manner to creating NFTs on other blockchain platforms. The introduction of Ordinals has created a buzz in the Bitcoin community, leading to significant traction and growing interest among users.</p>



<p>According to data from NFT aggregator <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CryptoSlam</a>, collections such as $INSC BRC-20 NFTs, Uncategorized Ordinals, $SATS BRC-20 NFTs, and $BRC-20 NFTs have seen substantial trading volumes, surpassing popular Ethereum collections like Azuki, BAYC, and DeGods.</p>

<p>The number of new inscriptions on Ordinals reached over 250,000 on Monday, based on data tracked by the data analytics platform <a href="https://dune.com/dgtl_assets/bitcoin-ordinals-analysis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dune Analytics</a>. This represents a surge of more than 300% since the launch of the Bitcoin Request for Comment BRC-69 token standard on July 3. The BRC-69 token standard, the modified version of the BRC-20 standard, has significantly reduced the cost of inscriptions for Ordinals by over 90%.</p>

<p>In contrast, Ethereum&#8217;s daily volume experienced only a 3.8% increase during the same period. However, it is important to note that Ethereum&#8217;s sales volume still exceeds that of Bitcoin.</p>



<p>Ordinals have witnessed a remarkable surge in both sales and active buyers, achieving over 130% growth in USD sales and capturing close to 10% of the buyer market. Although Ethereum currently leads the NFT sector with total sales surpassing $15.65 million, the rapid rise of Bitcoin Ordinals suggests a potential shift in dominance.</p>

<p>This shift indicates that traders&#8217; interest in Bitcoin NFTs has surpassed that of Ethereum. One contributing factor to Ethereum&#8217;s struggle to gain traction is the falling floor prices of its top collections.</p>



<p>While Ethereum previously held the title of the king of NFT volume, primarily due to its mass adoption in 2021, collections on the Ethereum blockchain have faced challenges in maintaining a steady upward trajectory since the beginning of the year. It was during this same period that Bitcoin Ordinals emerged, backed by the Taproot network, steadily gaining adoption despite controversies surrounding its operation on the Bitcoin network.</p>



<p>As Bitcoin Ordinals continue to set new records and attract increased attention, it remains to be seen if they will dethrone Ethereum and reshape the landscape of the NFT sector.</p>

<p>This method generates Bitcoin non-fungible tokens (NFTs) through a process called inscribing, and has become increasingly popular. In fact, the number of new inscriptions has already risen to over 350,000 on Monday, according to data tracked by Glassnode, a blockchain analytics firm.</p>



<p>This increase in daily inscriptions represents a surge of over 250% since <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://bitcoin.org/en/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ordinals</a> launchpad Luminex unveiled the BRC-69 token standard on July 3. This modified version of the BRC-20 standard has reduced the cost of inscriptions for Ordinals by over 90%.</p>

<p>Luminex said in a Tweet thread that with BRC69, the costs of inscriptions for Ordinals collections can be reduced by over 90% through a 4-step process: (1) inscribe traits, (2) deploy collection, (3) compile collection, and (4) mint assets. The brilliance of BRC69 lies in its simplicity, as minters only need to inscribe a single line of text instead of a full image. This text allows the final image to be automatically rendered on all ordinals-frontends, using solely on-chain resources, thanks to recursive inscriptions.</p>



<p>While the number of new inscriptions has surged, the daily fees paid for inscriptions remain stagnant, according to data tracked by Dune Analytics. This trend suggests that the BRC-69 token standard has delivered on its promise.</p>

<p>Ordinals was launched in January, bringing the NFT and smart contracts narrative to the Bitcoin blockchain and spurring investor interest in tokens like STX, the native token of Bitcoin layer 2 Stacks Network.</p>



<p>The Ordinals boom can be divided into two waves, according to Glassnode. The first wave represents activity between early February and late April, when image-based inscriptions led the way. The second wave began in May, with high free-paying text-based inscriptions leading the way. This trend suggests that the Ordinals market is still evolving and that we can expect to see more exciting developments in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Key points</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, remains optimistic about Web3 development in Hong Kong and the efforts of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) to regulate stablecoins. </li>



<li>Hong Kong is actively working on regulations for stablecoins to become a global virtual asset hub. The HKMA plans to introduce stablecoin regulations by 2024, recognizing the impact these products could have on financial markets. </li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle,<a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3227171/head-crypto-firm-circle-accepts-ban-mainland-china-sees-role-yuan-backed-stablecoins?module=live&amp;pgtype=homepage" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3227171/head-crypto-firm-circle-accepts-ban-mainland-china-sees-role-yuan-backed-stablecoins?module=live&amp;pgtype=homepage" rel="noreferrer noopener"> remains positive </a>about Web3 development in Hong Kong and the regulation of stablecoins. Despite China&#8217;s skepticism towards cryptocurrencies, Allaire sees stablecoins as a potential solution to internationalize the yuan.</strong> </h5>

<p></p>



<p>Jeremy Allaire, the co-founder and CEO of Circle, a USDC stablecoin operator, is optimistic about Web3 development in Hong Kong and stablecoins&#8217; regulation by the local monetary authority, despite not being under any illusions about mainland China opening its markets to cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>While some officials from mainland China have expressed support for Hong Kong&#8217;s moves to court the crypto industry, there has been no indication that Beijing is warming up to crypto.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, stablecoins, which are typically pegged to fiat currency, could offer a more immediate solution for the Chinese government&#8217;s goal of internationalizing the yuan than the central bank digital currency (CBDC) eCNY.</p>



<p>Jeremy Allaire cited a stablecoin pegged to the offshore yuan (CNH) as an example of how this might work. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has promised to roll out regulations on stablecoins by 2024, noting the potential impact such products could have on financial markets.</p>



<p>The HKMA has also been researching a possible digital Hong Kong dollar. There have been some questions about the future role of stablecoins in a well-regulated environment once CBDCs are available. For Jeremy Allaire, CBDCs are complementary and private coins still have a role to play in innovation.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>South Korea&#8217;s government has introduced accounting guidelines for virtual assets to address confusion and establish clear standards.</em></li>



<li><em>Guidelines define the timing of revenue recognition and treatment of stolen assets.</em></li>



<li><em>Stakeholder feedback is sought before finalizing guidelines.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <em><a href="https://www.news1.kr/articles/?5104557" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">News1</a></em>, in response to the lack of clear accounting standards for virtual assets, South Korea&#8217;s government has <a href="https://www.news1.kr/articles/?5104557" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduced</a> accounting guidelines to provide clarity and resolve market uncertainty.</strong></h5>

<p>The <a href="https://coincu.com/200554-south-koreas-fsc-requires-disclose-holdings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Financial Services Commission</a> and the Financial Supervisory Service have collaboratively prepared these guidelines, ensuring compliance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) through a reasonable interpretation. The move aims to establish comprehensive supervisory guidelines for accounting standards related to various transactions and stages involving virtual assets.</p>



<p>One of the primary issues addressed by the guidelines is the timing of revenue recognition for companies issuing <a href="https://coincu.com/199125-south-korea-passed-important-crypto-act/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">virtual assets</a>. Previously, different criteria were applied by each issuing entity, leading to discrepancies and differing opinions between companies and auditors. The guidelines now specify that revenue from the sale of virtual assets will be recognized only after the company fulfills all obligations to virtual asset holders. </p>



<p>Until such obligations are fulfilled, the payments received will be accounted for as liabilities. The guidelines further emphasize the need for clear delineation of the issuing company&#8217;s obligations to avoid retroactive changes that may delay revenue recognition.</p>



<p>Additionally, the guidelines shed light on the treatment of stolen assets. If an asset is classified as a liability in the issuer&#8217;s financial statements and subsequently stolen through hacking, it must be unconditionally compensated. However, if it is considered a customer&#8217;s asset, the liability for damages exists, but there is no obligation to reimburse the stolen amount.</p>

<p>The guidelines also address the recognition of development costs associated with virtual assets and platforms. Unless clear grounds are provided to classify such costs as intangible assets according to the prescribed standards, they will be treated as expenses when incurred. The guidelines establish six stringent requirements for the recognition of development costs, which necessitate objective evidence for compliance. Meeting these requirements is expected to pose challenges for companies.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the guidelines consider the recognition of assets and liabilities based on economic control over virtual assets, taking into account international trends and the level of legal property rights protection for customers. Factors such as customers&#8217; ability to claim legal property rights and operators&#8217; rights to freely utilize entrusted virtual assets will determine whether they are recognized as assets or liabilities of the operator.</p>

<p><a href="https://coincu.com/201159-south-korean-regulator-cracks-coin-gate-scandal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South Korea</a>&#8216;s government plans to gather feedback from stakeholders, including listed companies, virtual asset operators, and accounting firms, over a two-month period. The feedback will be taken into account for finalizing the revision of the supervision guidelines and standards. The revised guidelines and standards are expected to be announced and implemented during October and November, following deliberation and resolution by the Accounting System Deliberation Committee and the Securities and Futures Commission. The Accounting Supervision Guidelines will take immediate effect upon publication.</p>



<p>These comprehensive guidelines aim to provide reliable and useful information, facilitating comparisons between companies and ensuring greater transparency in the accounting practices related to virtual assets.</p>

<p>He appeared on the <a href="http://www.tvdaily.co.kr/read.php3?aid=16889688241679081019" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="http://www.tvdaily.co.kr/read.php3?aid=16889688241679081019" rel="noreferrer noopener">E Channel TV</a> talk show &#8220;Love of a Lifetime&#8221; with his fiancee Lee Young-joo, where he shared his financial situation with the audience.</p>



<p>Lee revealed that Seo tends to suffer from sleeplessness due to his work, but recently he has been unable to sleep due to his investments in cryptocurrency. She expressed her concern and wished that he wouldn&#8217;t invest in it. Despite dating for 10 years, the couple are currently planning their wedding. Seo had hoped to raise over $240,000 in two years to buy a house for the both of them. However, things have not gone according to plan, and he has lost between $61,230 and $77,000 on his investments. Had his investment been successful, it would have been a great help to their wedding fund.</p>



<p>Seo Chul-goo debuted in 2018 and has appeared on numerous rap and pop-themed reality TV shows. The TV talk show &#8220;Love of a Lifetime&#8221; is hosted by Kim Gu-ra, one of South Korea&#8217;s top entertainers, and TV presenter Kim Min-jung. The show invites economic experts to advise celebrity couples on how best to accumulate wealth and safeguard their investments.</p>



<p>During the show, Seo was shown nervously looking at crypto charts on PC monitors. Despite his losses, Seo remains optimistic and is determined to learn from his mistakes, ensuring that he makes better investment decisions in the future.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[According to Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire in a recent interview with the South China Morning Post, Beijing should consider allowing for Chinese Yuan (CNY)-backed stablecoins if it wants to internationalize its currency. <p class="has-text-align-right"><a href="https://coincu.com/201586-circle-ceo-urges-china-embrace-yuan-stablecoins/" target="_blank">Read more...</a></p><p class="has-text-align-right"><a href="https://coincu.com"><strong>Coincu News</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Beijing should consider CNY-backed stablecoins to internationalize its currency. </em></li>



<li><em>Stablecoins may be a better path than CBDCs for RMB use in global trade. </em></li>



<li><em>IMF says opening capital markets and full currency convertibility are key for yuan challenge to the dollar.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire in a <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3227171/head-crypto-firm-circle-accepts-ban-mainland-china-sees-role-yuan-backed-stablecoins?module=live&amp;pgtype=homepage" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3227171/head-crypto-firm-circle-accepts-ban-mainland-china-sees-role-yuan-backed-stablecoins?module=live&amp;pgtype=homepage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent interview</a> with the South China Morning Post, Beijing should consider allowing for Chinese Yuan (CNY)-backed stablecoins if it wants to internationalize its currency. </strong></h5>

<p>Allaire believes that if the Chinese government wants the RMB to be used more freely in trade and commerce around the world, stablecoins might be the way to achieve this instead of central bank digital currency.</p>



<p>While Allaire thinks that stablecoins are a better option than CBDCs, he also believes that the two are complementary. Central banks should upgrade their own systems to move away from legacy technology and use more modern distributed ledger technology, according to Allaire. This would be great for many things, he said, but he sees private sector innovation on the public internet as very different from the work done by central banks.</p>



<p>However, it is unlikely that authorities in China would allow such a plan to come to fruition. Capital controls and a ban on the free convertibility of the yuan are integral to China&#8217;s economic policy. The IMF&#8217;s First Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath said in 2022 that China would need to open its capital markets and allow for full currency convertibility if it wanted to challenge the dollar.</p>

<p>Other stakeholders have noted that China would be more likely to keep these rules in place than allow for free convertibility and an actual challenge to dollar dominance. Brad Setser, a former senior advisor to the U.S. trade representative during the Biden administration, told Foreign Policy that he thinks there will be incremental moves to make greater use of the yuan to denominate China&#8217;s trade with commodity-exporting countries. He then believes that China will discover that it is difficult to fully go much further and to really radically change the structure of how it settles its trade.</p>

<p>Asset manager Vanguard Group has recently increased its investments in Bitcoin mining companies, marking a notable shift in the company&#8217;s stance towards cryptocurrencies.

<p>Riot Blockchain, the largest crypto miner in the United States, trades on the Nasdaq as RIOT, and its stock is currently trading for $15.72 per share. Just two years ago, Vanguard Group claimed that the long-term investment case for cryptocurrencies was &#8220;weak.&#8221; However, the recent investments demonstrate a significant shift in the company&#8217;s attitude towards cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>The growth in institutional interest in cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, is becoming increasingly evident. Last week, Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, the world&#8217;s largest asset manager with $9.5 trillion worth of assets under management, said that Bitcoin was an &#8220;international asset.&#8221; </p>



<p>BlackRock also applied to the SEC for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund last month and is the second-largest investor in Marathon Digital, with 8.6 million shares. A number of other major fund managers have also applied for a Bitcoin ETF, which has helped to send the price of the cryptocurrency to a year-high.</p>
