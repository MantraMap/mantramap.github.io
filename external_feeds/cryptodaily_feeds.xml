			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Minnesota police reported that the victim made 21 transactions to a LinkedIn seductress in hopes of big returns, losing $9million in total.&nbsp;</p>
Biggest Crypto Scam Recorded in Minnesota
<p>According to the report, a resident of Eden Prairie, MN, routinely invested large sums of money into a crypto scam project called &ldquo;Coinrule-web3&rdquo; during the period of six months, from December 21 to June 8, 2023. Apparently, the person who promised quick profits was a woman the man connected on LinkedIn. The adulteress has also asked him to abandon his wife and run away with his LinkedIn partner.</p>
<p>As it was revealed, the victim initially topped sums of $100,000 at a time, keeping it all in secret from his wife. Seeing growing profits of his investments on a fake website, the man continued making deposits to the scammer&rsquo;s bank account. However, when he wanted to withdraw his money, the woman from LinkedIn told him there was a $2.8 million fee for collecting the returns.</p>
<p>The man called his wife &ldquo;in a panic&rdquo; and asked her to withdraw all their remaining assets in order to pay the fee. The wife then learned that her husband had been draining their investment accounts for the sake of a crypto scam over the past six months. On the next day, June 15, she called the police and reported the incident.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Police quickly found out that the &ldquo;Coinrule-web3&rdquo; name is associated with numerous "cryptocurrency and romance scams." The total sum of money lost in this particular case make it the largest crypto scam seen in the whole state so far:&nbsp;</p>

<p>"No one in the office has heard of a crypto fraud case as big," John Stiles, spokesman for Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, commented on the case. "In fact, their eyes popped when I told them the amount."</p>

<p>Police officials have declined to share more details about the victim or the progress of the investigation.</p>
Social Media Crypto Scams Rise in the US
<p>The FBI has previously reported other crypto fraud cases similar to the one in Minnesota.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to an FBI statement of March, the scheme usually begins "when fraudsters contact victims on social media or dating application sites, portraying some sort of 'innocent' connection when in all actuality it's a heavily scripted, calculated first move of many to build rapport and gain trust. </p>
<p>Eventually, these conversations lead to discussions of investment opportunities, wherein victims are lured into investing cryptocurrency funds using fake website/apps that allow them to track their investment progress. The deception becomes apparent when victims attempt to cash out their investments, or when communication with the fraudster is terminated."</p>

<p>These reports could be proof of rising crypto scam activity related to social media in the US. To avoid becoming a victim of fraud, the FBI offers cautionary measures:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">pay close attention to website domain names;&nbsp;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">avoid using suspicious looking apps for investment;&nbsp;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">research a digital currency before buying it.</li>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The IRS decreed US crypto investors deriving income from staking services must include the fair market value of those rewards in the gross income the moment they gain control of those assets. </p>
<p>The US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has declared US cryptocurrency investors must include staking rewards as part of their gross income. According to the IRS&rsquo;s directive, taxpayers must include the fair market value of staking rewards as soon as they gain control of those assets.</p>
Staking Rewards Become Taxable
<p>The IRS&rsquo;s directive states that staking rewards in crypto become subject to income tax within the US the moment they are in the taxpayer&rsquo;s possession. It declares the instant an owner is awarded units of digital assets as incentives for validation, their fair market value must be included in the taxpayer&rsquo;s income in the tax year in which the staking rewards were obtained. The IRS specifies:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fair market value is determined as of the date and time the taxpayer gains dominion and control over the validation rewards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to the IRS, general tax principles apply to property transactions and crypto transactions. Thus, any reward obtained through staking must be included within an individual&rsquo;s gross income as it applies to rent, royalties, and compensation for goods and services.</p>
<p>Further, the IRS states taxpayers compensated for goods and services through cryptocurrencies, including crypto miners, must also include the market value of the assets as part of their taxable income. The agency explains:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If a cash-method taxpayer stakes cryptocurrency native to a proof-of-stake blockchain and receives additional units of cryptocurrency as rewards when validation occurs, the fair market value of the validation rewards received is included in the taxpayer&rsquo;s gross income in the taxable year in which the taxpayer gains dominion and control over the validation rewards.&rdquo;</p>

The Future of Staking in the US Remains Unclear
<p>Staking services have been the topic of controversy in the US over the past six months. Uncertainty over staking services started when the SEC sued crypto exchange Kraken over its staking business, and Kraken agreed to suspend the service and pay a $30 million fine.</p>
<p>Coinbase has pressed the SES for regulatory clarity surrounding the industry, specifically concerning staking. The exchange petitioned the securities agency to exclude staking from its definition of securities. Still, the SEC maintain staking services through intermediaries, such as in the case of Kraken, which meets the requirements of the Howey Test and qualifies as securities.</p>
<p>Despite ongoing requests to the SEC to clarify staking, the agency has not yet offered any guidance or regulation. In light of the regulatory uncertainty in the US, Coinbase announced it suspended its staking services in California, New Jersey, South Carolina, and Wisconsin following preliminary order by local state regulators.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Worldcoin, a new crypto project offering digital IDs via iris-scanning, has been suspended by the Kenyan government over privacy and security concerns.&nbsp;</p>
Kenyan Government Suspends Worldcoin&rsquo;s Activities
<p>Only 10 days after the official launch of Worldcoin, the project has already been suspended in one of the few countries where the company&rsquo;s iris-scanning device Orb was available.</p>
<p>Kenya was one of the first countries to open registration for World ID back in 2021. It is also reportedly one of the regions that got the highest number of sign ups. Initially, Worldcoin listed around 18 Orb-locations that would open in Kenya but in the end left only one &ndash; Kenyatta International Convention Centre.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of Kenyans flocked to the Orb to get their iris scanned and receive the World ID. They may have also been motivated to undergo the procedure by the 25 WLD (equivalent to around 7,000 shillings) Worldcoin promised to give everyone for the identity verification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, despite the platform's high demand in the country, the Kenyan government decided to suspend all Worldcoin&rsquo; activities on Wednesday, August 2. The Ministry of Interior and National Administration of Kenya reported that relevant agencies need to &ldquo;certify the absence of risks to the general public whatsoever&rdquo;.</p>

<p>"Relevant security, financial services and data protection agencies have commenced inquiries and investigations to establish the authenticity and legality of the aforesaid activities, and the safety and protection of the data being harvested, and how the harvesters intend to use the data,&rdquo; Kithure Kindiki, Kenya&rsquo;s Cabinet Secretary for the Ministry of Interior and National Administration, said in the statement.</p>

<p>Worldcoin officials haven&rsquo;t yet commented on the news.</p>
Worldcoin Continues to Face Backlash
<p>The controversial crypto project has been heavily criticized after its launch and received both applause and judgment. Even though only Kenya has officially suspended Worldcoin&rsquo;s services so far, the company has been under scrutiny from a number of other countries, especially in Europe. France and the UK have recently reported that their privacy watchdogs are investigating the project to verify the security of the data it collects.</p>
<p>On the day of the Worldcoin&rsquo;s launch, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has also published a long essay about Worldcoin in particular and the biometric proof of personhood in general. He listed four major risks with the project&rsquo;s system related to privacy of the collected data and accessibility of the Orb device.&nbsp;</p>
WLD Token Gains 7% in the Last 24 Hours
<p>The Worldcoin token has shown growth in the past week, gaining about 7% just in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. However, WLD still struggles to return to its $3.1 mark it reached on the day of its release. The token is hovering at $2.44 at the time of writing.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s5">Market analysts have forecasted another bull market, with meme coins expected to surge massively. In anticipation of gains, Shiba Inu sharks and dolphins are rapidly accumulating SHIB tokens. Pomerdoge (POMD), adding to the excitement in the meme coin landscape, is building a P2E gaming ecosystem. Top analysts are forecasting a massive surge for the POMD token.</p>

Shiba Inu Sharks and Dolphins Amass SHIB Tokens
<p class="s5">The cryptocurrency market is on the cusp of another bull market and Shiba Inu investors are getting ready. According to new data published by Santiment, they are now accumulating tokens projected to rise in the bull market.</p>
<p class="s5">The data shows that over the last eight weeks, Shiba Inu sharks and dolphins have bought $9 million worth of SHIB. Sharks and dolphins are wallets that hold between 10 million-100 billion SHIB tokens. The accumulation of SHIB tokens comes after the public release of a beta bridge in anticipation of the Shibarium launch.</p>
<p class="s5">Shibarium is Shiba Inu&rsquo;s most anticipated layer-2 scaling solution expected to improve network performance. The launch scheduled for August is expected to cause a SHIB rally. Now trading at $0.000008384, Shiba Inu is expected to bridge the $0.000010 resistance at the launch of Shibarium.</p>
Pomerdoge (POMD) Accumulation Spikes Ahead of Massive Rally 
<p class="s5">Another token Shiba Inu investors have been stacking up is Pomerdoge (POMD). The new play-to-earn token promises even bigger returns than Shiba Inu in 2023. Promising up to a 4,000% increase before the end of 2023, Pomerdoge has captured the attention of a lot of investors.</p>
<p class="s5">It combines the already popular meme coin sector with the fast-growing P2E sector. The goal is to create an immersive gaming ecosystem where gamers are rewarded for their accomplishments as well as their effort.</p>
<p class="s5">Gamers will create avatars in the ecosystem known as Pomerdoges. They will be able to customize and upgrade their Pomerdoges to increase their chances of winning in competitions. Pomerdoge will also allow gamers to interact amongst themselves outside the area for competitions.</p>
<p class="s5">The ecosystem will also feature a Pomerplace &ndash; a non-fungible token marketplace. Here, the gamers will be able to trade skins, in-game items, and other valuable assets. The combination of meme coins with entertainment is what has made POMD one of the most popular tokens still in presale.</p>
<p class="s5">Early participants of the presale will get access to an exclusive collection of 7,777 NFTs. Each of these NFTs will hold immense value and benefits. At the time of this writing, the POMD token trades at $0.007 in the first stage of its presale. The promised price rally would see the token trade as high as $0.28 by the end of this year.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s6">Tradecurve (TCRV) is considered one such rare project, with which you can mint millions in the crypto industry.Therefore, its ongoing presale is getting oversubscribed during each stage. On the other hand, Litecoin (LTC) and TRON (TRX) are swinging wildly, making their holders nervous.</p>
<p class="s6">The crypto market is intrinsically volatile, but you can get some enormous returns on your investment if you choose a stable, and growth-oriented project.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>
Litecoin&rsquo;s (LTC) Trade Volume Sinks
<p class="s6">Amid the current dwindling market, Litecoin (LTC) has not been able to put up a strong performance. As per the data from Tradingview, the trading volume on the Litecoin network has been declining.</p>
<p class="s6">Subsequently, the price of Litecoin has tumbled, with its exchange rate falling by 18% in the past week. Currently, Litecoin is being traded at $72.58. Experts say that Litecoin&rsquo;s market health has worsened since the SEC described LTC as a security.</p>
<p class="s6">Thus, the hype around Litecoin&rsquo;s upcoming halving event has waned. Although the Litecoin community hopes to see a price rebound ahead of the halving event scheduled in August, the fading hype around it may hurt LTC in the long run.</p>
TRON (TRX) And DWF Labs Join Hands
<p class="s6">TRON (TRX) has been suffering with selloff pressure for the past many days. Subsequently, Tron&rsquo;s value on exchanges has taken a toll. The trading price of TRON has nosedived by more than 10% in the past seven days.</p>
<p class="s6">At the time of writing, TRON is changing hands at $0.0695. Meanwhile, to sustain its network growth and prevent the price from falling further, TRON has entered into a strategic partnership with DWF Labs.</p>
<p class="s6">Through this collaboration, DWF Labs will act as a liquidity provider for TRON. However, experts believe that TRON will not be able to get any immediate relief with this partnership.</p>
Tradecurve Shows Bullish Path To Dwindling Market
<p class="s6">After the collapse of the FTX exchange, which wiped out $2 billion in customer funds, traders have become apprehensive about the credibility of centralized exchanges. The situation has worsened with the latest lawsuits filed against well-established platforms like Binance and Coinbase. Therefore, traders are jumping ships to register on the Tradecurve (TCRV) exchange.</p>
<p class="s6">It is a new decentralized trading platform, which is set to enter the top 3 crypto exchanges list. The platform enables people to trade various classes of assets on a single platform, without relying on fiat payments.</p>
<p class="s6">To assure traders of their anonymity and privacy, Tradecurve has not implemented any KYC procedure on the platform. This makes it one of the first such crypto exchanges, eclipsing other centralized platforms like Coinbase, where users are mandated to input their sensitive details. It has also implemented 2FA security, and DeFi capabilities to ensure the protection of traders.</p>
<p class="s6">The platform offers many benefits to its token holders, including exclusive deposit bonuses, discounts on transaction fees, and high leverage starting from 500:1. The platform&rsquo;s presale stage 5 is live, and a token is now available for $0.025. The project&rsquo;s market value has been pegged to grow by 80x in the next few months.</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) continued to experience elevated volatility early in the Asian session as the pair was lifted from the 28552.42 level and reached the 30033 area before moving back below the 29400 area.&nbsp; Stops were recently elected below the 29089.49 and 28775.19 levels, downside price objectives associated with selling pressure around the 29851.28 area.&nbsp; Additional Stops were elected below the 28999, 28874, and 28672 areas during the acute selloff, downside price objectives related to recent selling pressure around the 29526 and 29344 levels.&nbsp; Additional downside price objectives linked to recent selling pressure include the 28432, 27979, 27409, 27246, and 26501 levels.&nbsp; Below the market, additional downside price objectives include the 28213, 28137, 27757, 27430, 27338, 27312, 26348, and 26199 levels.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, the 28095.44 area represents the 23.6% retracement of the historic depreciating range from 69000 to 15460.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>A congressional committee in the United States is currently investigating asset management firm BlackRock for its role in facilitating investments into Chinese companies that the U.S. government has blacklisted.&nbsp;</p>
Retirement Funds Tied to Blacklisted Chinese Firms
<p>Lawmakers have expressed concern that Americans' retirement funds are unknowingly being funneled into Chinese firms flagged for security and human rights issues, and they believe BlackRock has been involved in this process. The House of Representatives Select Committee on the CCP has notified BlackRock about the investigations, with the intention of gathering facts to inform U.S. policies on capital flows to China. According to the committee, the massive influx of American capital into these Chinese entities further exacerbates national security threats and undermines American values.</p>
<p>The committee has claimed that the firm has facilitated the investment of over $429 million across five funds in such blacklisted Chinese companies. The committee has raised concerns over the scope of these investments, suggesting that the true scale may be much larger.</p>
BlackRock's Response
<p>In response to the allegations, BlackRock has denied any wrongdoing. The firm stated that it complies with all applicable U.S. government laws in its investments, both in China and markets around the world. The investment firm, which manages over $9 billion of assets, expressed its willingness to engage directly with the Select Committee regarding the issues raised.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A congressional committee in the United States is currently investigating asset management firm BlackRock for its role in facilitating investments into Chinese companies that the U.S. government has blacklisted.&nbsp;</p>
Retirement Funds Tied to Blacklisted Chinese Firms
<p>Lawmakers have expressed concern that Americans' retirement funds are unknowingly being funneled into Chinese firms flagged for security and human rights issues, and they believe BlackRock has been involved in this process. The House of Representatives Select Committee on the CCP has notified BlackRock about the investigations, with the intention of gathering facts to inform U.S. policies on capital flows to China. According to the committee, the massive influx of American capital into these Chinese entities further exacerbates national security threats and undermines American values.</p>
<p>The committee has claimed that the firm has facilitated the investment of over $429 million across five funds in such blacklisted Chinese companies. The committee has raised concerns over the scope of these investments, suggesting that the true scale may be much larger.</p>
BlackRock's Response
<p>In response to the allegations, BlackRock has denied any wrongdoing. The firm stated that it complies with all applicable U.S. government laws in its investments, both in China and markets around the world. The investment firm, which manages over $9 billion of assets, expressed its willingness to engage directly with the Select Committee regarding the issues raised.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>A currency swap with the PBoC together with a loan from the Development Bank of Latin America helps Argentine central bank to meet $3.7 billion obligation to IMF.</p>
IMF enslavement
<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) was established after the Bretton Woods agreement, and since then has provided loans to developing countries, however some have pointed out that the loans have served to export the dollar and enslave countries with repayments rather than help them to develop.</p>
<p>Argentina is one of the most indebted countries in the world, having defaulted many times in its torrid financial history. The latest default avoidance was made possible by the People&rsquo;s Bank of China stepping in and providing the means for Argentina to meet its IMF obligation by way of $1.7 billion in yuan currency swaps.</p>
<p>According to the South China Morning Post, the intervention of the PBoC and the Latin American Development Bank has only succeeded in buying time for Argentina. Ariel Gonzalez Levaggi of the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina was quoted by the SCMP as saying &ldquo;it does not provide a viable way out for Argentina.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, it does mean that for now Argentina does not have to dip into any of its dollar reserves, which wouldn&rsquo;t have been adequate with which to pay the debt and would have placed the country in an extremely precarious situation.</p>
Further encroachment into dollar hegemony
<p>This recent move by China is seen by many as an attempt to undermine the use of the US dollar for debt settlement, and another nail in the coffin of de-dollarisation. Alexandre Coelho of the International Political Science Association, and former legal advisor to the Bank of China said on the matter:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Although the renminbi has been part of the IMF currency basket since 2016, its use for debt settlement is not common. The path chosen by Argentina sets a precedent and may, in the future, be adopted by other emerging countries in a similar situation,&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the BRICS countries prepare for their summit later this month, and a potential announcement of a rumoured gold-backed currency to rival the dollar reserve currency, the US domination of global finances could certainly be slackening.&nbsp;</p>
Bitcoin - the last hope for world citizens
<p>In addition, the IMF&rsquo;s scathing view of El Salvador&rsquo;s adoption of Bitcoin as a joint legal currency with the dollar while at the same time exacting a promise from the Argentine central bank to steer clear of Bitcoin as a requirement for payment of its loan looks to be patronising and a form of bullying.</p>
<p>The global financial system is changing, and whether the good will of China is actually that, and not just a way of usurping monetary power from the US in order to achieve its own world domination remains to be seen.</p>
<p>This is probably the likely scenario, and therefore Bitcoin is still potentially the only way out of super power domination for the world&rsquo;s citizens. A currency/store of value such as Bitcoin, that has no government or politics backing it, remains an extremely attractive proposition.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s5">2023 has brought forth a promising array of young projects that are capturing the attention of enthusiasts and investors alike. These breakthrough initiatives encompass a diverse range of areas, offering innovative solutions to some of the most pressing challenges faced in the virtual space. From an innovative social media gamified approach and decentralized personal identification system to advanced infrastructure solutions for seamless interaction with the blockchain, these projects are paving the way for a more accessible, secure, and interconnected crypto ecosystem.</p>
<p class="s5">As the world continues to embrace the potential of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, these five projects stand out for their ambitious visions and disruptive approaches. With a shared commitment to pushing the boundaries of what's possible, they hold the potential to redefine how we engage with the digital realm and leverage the power of decentralized networks. In this exploration of the most noteworthy young projects in the crypto industry for 2023, we delve into the cutting-edge innovations that are shaping the future of finance, identity management, and decentralized applications.</p>
Cheelee
<p class="s5">Cheelee, a Web3 GameFi short video platform that rewards users for watching the feed, changes the way people make money on social media.</p>
<p class="s5">Cheelee uses the Attention Economy concept to give everyone a new way of earning an income and a living wage, regardless of age, occupation, or socioeconomic background, and has the potential to redefine the social media industry while helping solve the problem of job automation by AI.</p>

<p class="s5">"Cheelee is a game-changing Web3 GameFi short video platform that reshapes the landscape of social media platforms and rebalances the power which was earlier concentrated in the hands of platform owners, bloggers and advertisers. Our platform is not just about watching short videos; it's about empowering users to become more active in their virtual journey," CPO Cheelee Yuriy Kardonov explains.</p>

<p class="s5">To inspire new users to learn its money-making mechanisms, the app gives them a free pair of Starting Digital glasses. Users that upgrade these glasses can increase their initial investment by more than X2. Cheeleers manage to earn up to several thousand dollars monthly with this tool, as seen from their reports on the platform's socials.</p>
<p class="s5">Cheelee is going to blow up in 2023 with its governance token, $CHEEL, which has been steadily increasing in value and shows great promise because of its limited supply, high utility, and possible access to almost 5 billion social media users around the world. Cheeleeis already available on App Store and Google Play.</p>
WorldCoin
<p class="s5">Meet Worldcoin, a unique cryptocurrency project with a mission to verify people's identities online and combat the problem of bots and fake virtual profiles created by AI. Their special system, Proof-of-Personhood, works by scanning your eyes to ensure you are who you claim to be, preventing multiple accounts and stopping fraud.</p>

<p class="s5">"A very central one is, how can you prove that you are a real human (not a bot) and have not yet claimed your free share of the currency, without revealing personal information about yourself like your name or email. Making this work in a scalable and fraud-proof way is hard," explains Alex Blania, co-founder of Worldcoin and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the project.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="s5">Founded in 2019 by Sam Altman (CEO of OpenAI), Max Novendstern, and Alex Blania, and supported by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, Worldcoin uses a distribution method similar to universal basic income (UBI) to encourage users to join their network. They offer their cryptocurrency as a reward to users who get their iris scanned using Worldcoin's orb-shaped iris scanner.</p>
<p class="s5">Worldcoin has been highly successful in raising funds, starting with $25 million in October 2021 and an additional $100 million in just six months, boosting the token's value to an impressive $3 billion. And they didn't stop there, announcing another $115 million in funding in May 2023.</p>
<p class="s5">As of January 2023, Worldcoin celebrated reaching 1 million sign-ups, with more than 115,000 new users in December 2022 alone. Their user base is diverse, coming from various countries like Argentina, Chile, India, Kenya, Portugal, Spain, and Uganda. By July 2023, they expanded to over 2 million users, and their World App is rocking with over 500,000 monthly active users.</p>
Arkham Intelligence
<p class="s5">Introducing Arkham Intelligence, a company focused on blockchain intelligence. Their platform is designed to reveal information about the real-world entities and individuals connected to cryptocurrencies, giving valuable insights into the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The goal is to remove anonymity from the blockchain and shed light on the identities behind cryptocurrency transactions.</p>

<p class="s5">"Our industry has been plagued with bad actors who survive by hiding in the shadows. Crypto intelligence brings them into the light, and that&rsquo;s what our platform and our research have always done," Arkham CEO Miguel Morel tweeted.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="s5">In July 2023, Arkham Intelligence launched a bounty marketplace, enabling people to buy and sell on-chain cryptocurrency data. To facilitate these trades, they introduced the ARKM token as the main currency on the Arkham Intelligence exchange. Currently, as of July 2023, the ARKM token is being traded at $0.75 with a market cap of $113 million. For example, two savvy users of the Arkham platform recently earned a substantial reward of nearly $6,000 for successfully uncovering Do Kwon's wallet.</p>
<p class="s5">The initial request to track the wallets of the former head of Terraform Labs was placed on the on-chain data marketplace, Arkham Intel Exchange. Two online detectives took up the challenge and accomplished the bounty hunt with great success, providing evidence that several addresses indeed belong to the businessman. As a result, they were rewarded with 9519 ARKM tokens, equivalent to approximately $5971.</p>
Fetch.ai
<p class="s5">Fetch.ai is an open-source machine learning platform, decentralized and based on a distributed ledger. It offers secure access to AI for smart and autonomous services. They've also made Agentverse, a web3 virtual hub, letting users create autonomous agents easily, no matter their technical skills.</p>
<p class="s5">The platform's smart ledger combines blockchain with direct acrylic graph (DAG) tech. Transactions can be assigned to different routes, forming a fragmented network. New routes can be created if existing ones get overloaded. Fetch.ai uses UPoW (useful proof-of-work/proof-of-beneficial work), a mix of proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, and other mechanisms.</p>
<p class="s5">FET is the primary value exchange on Fetch.ai. It's essential for network exchanges, staking, and rewarding node operators. FET unlocks various operations on the network and acts as the main payment method. It's also needed to find, create, deploy, and train autonomous economic agents.</p>
<p class="s5">Fetch.ai's disruptive nature stems from its ability to challenge the status quo in machine learning, blockchain technology, and decentralized applications, offering new solutions and possibilities that can potentially reshape industries and user experiences.</p>
Arbitrum
<p class="s5">Arbitrum, developed by Offchain Labs in 2018, is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. Its purpose is to address the Ethereum network's limitations, like slow transaction speeds and high fees during busy times. By reducing work and data storage on Ethereum's mainnet(Layer 1 or L1), Arbitrum aims to decrease network congestion and transaction costs, enhancing the speed and scalability of Ethereum smart contracts.</p>

<p class="s5">"Our mission at Arbitrum is to scale Ethereum without compromising on security. Notice that we're focused on the result, not the tool. On the end, not the means," wrote Steven Goldfeder, co-founder and CEO of Offchain Labs.</p>

<p class="s5">Arbitrum enables users to perform transactions off the main network, which are later verified and grouped before being added to the main chain. This process helps ease congestion and lower gas fees on Ethereum, benefiting decentralized finance (DeFi) projects like Sushiswapand Aave, which utilize Arbitrum to offer efficient swaps with lower gas fees. The platform supports the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), allowing seamless integration with existing Ethereum tools and infrastructure for DeFi developers.</p>
<p class="s5">To gain exposure to the Arbitrum network, individuals can consider the governance token, ARB. Holders of ARB tokens can participate in the protocol's decision-making processes, including proposing and voting on upgrades or changes. Additionally, ARB tokens are used to pay for transaction fees on the Arbitrum network. Despite being launched in March 2023, the ARB token has already reached a market capitalization of over one billion dollars.</p>

Financial Performance in Q2 2023
<p>Andrew Kang, the Chief Financial Officer of MicroStrategy, emphasized the importance of their bitcoin holdings in light of favorable factors such as increasing institutional interest, progress on accounting transparency, and ongoing regulatory clarity for bitcoin.</p>
<p>MicroStrategy's gross profit for the second quarter of 2023 was $93.3 million, representing a gross margin of 77.5%. By reducing operating expenses by 88.2% from that of Q2 2022 and other significant changes in the company&rsquo;s loss and revenue structure, MicroStrategy was able to bring in its digital asset impairment losses to $24.1 million for Q2 2023, compared to the significantly higher amount of $917.8 million in Q2 2022.&nbsp;</p>
MicroStrategy's Vision and Strategies
<p>In its latest earnings report, MicroStrategy spoke about its two corporate strategies: first, to acquire and hold bitcoin as a dependable store of value, and second, to grow its enterprise analytics software business to promote its vision of Intelligence Everywhere. The company views Bitcoin as an attractive investment and has been committed to increasing its bitcoin holdings over time.</p>
<p>President and CEO Phong Le highlighted their new MicroStrategy ONE platform, saying,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our new MicroStrategy ONE platform is the most important product innovation in the history of our company because it represents a fundamental shift in our industry to harness the power of business intelligence and artificial intelligence together to upgrade the way organizations do business.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Utilizing AI with no preset prices to place orders at the optimal price is the point.</p>
<p>- AI's capabilities will shine through considering factors like information processing time.</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) trading specialist, "MensAi," is gaining attention for introducing a new paradigm in the trading field.</p>
<p>With the recent launch of the AI trading bot called "MensAi Bot," there is a growing</p>
<p>expectation that AI will completely replace traders in the securities and cryptocurrency markets.</p>
<p>MensAi is an automatic Ai trading bot that was first released on the global cryptocurrency exchange "OKX Exchange". Notably, it is based on raw data from OKX Exchange and has undergone AI training led by a group of experts from global corporations.</p>
<p>The program specializes in portfolio tracking, management, and trade performance analysis.</p>
<p>Its merit lies in its ability to autonomously select coins, expanding its capabilities beyond conventional trading bots. Furthermore, MensAi Bot's key feature is its expertise in machine learning AI for perpetual swaps, enabling it to perform both long and short trades. Its strength lies in conservative asset management, ensuring profitability while safeguarding investors' assets. As a result, it has been highly regarded as a valuable bot for novice investors.</p>
<p>MensAi Bot performs specialized functions based on the vast big data of the exchange, including backtesting and paper trading using indicators and tools.</p>
<p>MensAi emphasized the increasing role of AI in the virtual asset investment sector with the launch of MensAi Bot. As traditional trading bot functions, which were previously limited to use by a few financial institutions and experts, continue to advance, there has been a recent increase in the utilization by individual investors.</p>
<p>An official from MensAi stated,</p>

<p>"Unlike conventional programs that automatically buy and</p>
<p>sell at specific preset prices, AI has no predefined prices."</p>
<p>They added, "The key is for AI to capture real-time fluctuations in the stocks or coins that need to be traded and place orders when it determines the optimal price." In essence, AI-based trading involves no preset prices and continually monitors market fluctuations to maximize investor convenience by placing orders at the best price or profit potential.</p>

<p>MensAi highlighted that even beginners can benefit from the trading bot, which repeatedly executes buy and sell actions based on familiar and well-known indicators.</p>
<p>Representative indicators include MACD (Moving Average Convergence and Divergence),moving averages used for predicting stock prices, the golden cross known as a bullish signal, RSI (Relative Strength Index), and the volatility indicator, Bollinger Bands.</p>
<p>Additionally, MensAi backed its claims with actual performance cases, stating that AI trading bots outperformed conventional programs.</p>
<p>It asserted that, over the long term, the difference in profits can reach as high as 5 to 13</p>
<p>basis points (bps), which translates to significant amounts due to the large order volume in real performance.</p>
<p>Regarding the potential of AI, a MensAi representative stated,</p>

<p>"Ultimately, AI is highly likely</p>
<p>to surpass human capabilities in finding patterns in data and identifying trading opportunities.</p>
<p>However, while humans will still be needed for decision-making in new environments or</p>
<p>understanding the context of information, AI is already making a difference when considering</p>
<p>factors like information processing time."</p>
<p>They added, "Though individual trader performance may vary, comparing human and AI trading skills are incomparable. It's similar to the situation when cars were invented, but some people still continued using horse-drawn carriages."</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Image source: KX</p>
<p>Crypto venture firm KX says it&rsquo;s putting Thailand at the forefront of Web3 development with its latest investments in Magic and Transak. It says it invested in the startups earlier this year as part of a wider push to accelerate its vision around decentralized commerce and Web3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>KX, the venture building arm of Kasikorn Business Technology Group, aims to become a key player in Thailand&rsquo;s active Web3 scene, which has been aided by the huge popularity of cryptocurrency in the country. According to the 2022 Global Crypto Adoption Index by Chainalysis, Thailand is ranked 8th in the world in terms of crypto adoption and it has emerged as the home for a number of Web3 startups, thanks in part to its reputation as a hub for digital nomads.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The investments in Magic and Transak are strategic, as part of KX&rsquo;s plan to boost decentralized commerce in the region. Magic is an established crypto wallet-as-a-service provider that enables Web3 developers to create customized wallets, complete with onboarding tools and fiat on- and off-ramps. Meanwhile, Transak is a payment and onboarding infrastructure provider that makes it possible to acquire and sell crypto in a way that feels intuitive to Web2 users. It&rsquo;s notable that both startups are focused on technology that makes it simple to bring new users into Web3, as per KX&rsquo;s mission.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides investing in promising Web3 projects, KX has also developed its own crypto applications. It&rsquo;s the creator of one of the most popular NFT marketplaces in Thailand, known as Coral NFT, which makes it possible to buy digital assets with local currency. In addition, it has created an on-chain wealth management app called Bigfin.</p>

<p>KX Venture Director Paul Thanaarmates Arriyavat said the investments in Magic and Transak underscore its commitment to shaping the future of decentralized commerce. &ldquo;We are deeply invested in unlocking the true potential of the Web3 ecosystem, and by backing these trailblazing companies, we aim to nurture a digital landscape that is secure, compliant and accessible for all,&rdquo; he said.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>As Bitcoin approaches its own halving next year, Litecoin&rsquo;s has already arrived, as miner block rewards go from 12.5 to 6.25 LTC per block later on today.</p>
The silver to Bitcoin&rsquo;s gold
<p>When Litecoin creator Charlie Lee read an article in 2011 about this new form of payment that was being used on the Silk Road at the time he was immediately intrigued, and set about copying many aspects of the Bitcoin code in order to produce his own blockchain which he called Litecoin.</p>
<p>Litecoin, often called the silver to Bitcoin&rsquo;s gold, is still with us, and holders will celebrate its third halving event at around 15:08 UTC (16:08 BST). The mining rewards will be cut in half, leading to what founder Charlie Lee calls a &ldquo;disinflationary&rdquo; system.</p>
The Litecoin price history
<p>It can be argued that the Litecoin halving, although a disinflationary event, does not actually impact the price, at least not in the short term. At the time of the first Litecoin halving in August 2015 price remained flat, with the odd spike to the up or downside, all the way up until late March of 2017 when the first great hyperbolic rise in price began.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Litecoin went from $4 to around $370 by the end of the year. A bear market then ensued, which took the price all the way back down to $21.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Litecoin&rsquo;s second halving in August 2019 happened as the price was on the way down to a double bottom which finally arrived at $23 in early March 2020. From here another hyperbolic rise took place which coincided with Bitcoin&rsquo;s first double-top peak. Litecoin hit $413.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, whereas Bitcoin&rsquo;s second top went even higher, the second Litecoin spike came short of $300 before both cryptos began their descent into the next bear market.</p>
<p>This time, Litecoin looked to have bottomed at around $40. Since then the price has ground higher, turning the major resistance at $90 into support, and also the very critical 200-day moving average.</p>
<p>Just as Bitcoin is battling to turn its own major resistance at $30,000 into support, Litecoin needs to now hold where it is, making a higher low, and potentially going on to make a higher high in the coming bull market.</p>
<p>Litecoin certainly isn&rsquo;t Bitcoin, but it does share many of its characteristics, and this latest halving will reduce supply by half, making it a lot more attractive for those looking for what might be seen as a cheaper alternative to Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Litecoin certainly isn&rsquo;t Bitcoin, but it does share many of its characteristics, and this latest halving will reduce supply by half, making it a lot more attractive for those looking for what might be seen as a cheaper alternative to Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>A scammer managed to steal $20 million worth of Tether (USDT) on the 1st of August, using a zero transfer phishing attack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tether immediately swung into action, blocking the scammer&rsquo;s address and blacklisting them, all within an hour of the attack being orchestrated.&nbsp;</p>
Zero Transfer Attack&nbsp;
<p>Blockchain users have to always be on their guard when making on-chain transactions, primarily due to the threat of hackers and scammers. One such scammer managed to steal $20 million worth of Tether (USDT) by orchestrating a zero-transfer phishing attack. Most zero-transfer attacks operate using the same modus operandi. Hackers trick the user into sending a $0 transaction to a phishing address similar to an address the victim frequently transacts with or transfers funds to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users typically check only the first and last few digits of a wallet address and ignore reading the complete address. This is the loophole that hackers are able to use, outsmarting the intended victim with a phishing address that looks similar to the original address. Users that don&rsquo;t bother to check the whole address typically fall for such attacks. For example, if a user sends 100 coins to a particular address, the hacker could send 0 coins from the victim&rsquo;s wallet to a similar address controlled by the attacker.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The victim views the transaction in their transaction history and assumes that the address in question is the proper address and ends up sending the transaction to the phishing address instead.&nbsp;</p>
The Tether Attack&nbsp;
<p>Data from On-chain analytic firm PeckShield has shown that a scammer managed to grab $20 million worth of USDT using this type of attack. The intended address to which the victim wanted to send the funds was 0xa7B4BAC8f0f9692e56750aEFB5f6cB5516E90570. However, the scammer tricked the victim into sending the funds to another address, 0xa7Bf48749D2E4aA29e3209879956b9bAa9E90570, as shown by PeckShield in its analysis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data shows that the victim&rsquo;s wallet address initially received $10 million from a Binance account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was sent to another address before the scammer jumped into the middle of the transaction, sending a fake Zero USDT transfer from the victim&rsquo;s account to the phishing address in question. Following this, the victim inadvertently ended up sending 20 million USDT to the phishing address, thinking they were transferring it to the original address.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;#PeckShieldAlert A #ZeroTransfer scammer grabbed 20M $USDT from 0x4071...9Cbc. Intended Address: 0xa7B4BAC8f0f9692e56750aEFB5f6cB5516E90570 Phishing Address: 0xa7Bf48749D2E4aA29e3209879956b9bAa9E90570.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tether Swings Into Action&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tether was extremely proactive in dealing with the scammer, almost immediately freezing the stolen funds by putting the scammer&rsquo;s address on a blacklist. This was done barely an hour after the attack. Tether&rsquo;s quick response has raised plenty of eyebrows regarding the victim&rsquo;s identity, with on-chain sleuth ZachXBT tweeting his curiosity about the victim&rsquo;s identity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Curious who this would be if it were blacklisted within ~1 hr. Tether takes days to do that after obvious hacks but was acted here extremely quickly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to some members of the crypto community, the victim could be an influential individual or a very large firm. Zero transfer scams are becoming increasingly common in the crypto space over the past year. The first instance of a big zero transfer scam occurred in December 2022, with the ecosystem losing around $40 million to similar attacks since.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Curve Finance and CEO Michael Egorov have received support from prominent names in the crypto space, including Justin Sun and DCF God.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Curve had suffered a major exploit earlier in the week, leading to the protocol losing nearly $50 million to hackers.&nbsp;</p>
Chaos At Curve Finance&nbsp;
<p>Curve Finance suffered a major exploit earlier in the week, allowing hackers to siphon off nearly $50 million worth of crypto. This included CRV tokens worth $4.52 million, leading to a significant drop in the token&rsquo;s price. The exploit resulted from a reentrancy bug in Vyper, the programming language powering parts of the Curve ecosystem. The CRV token saw a decline of nearly 20% following the attack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The markets were further spooked after reports emerged that the founder of Curve Finance, Michael Egorov, had allegedly taken several loans, using nearly 47% of the total circulating supply of CRV. Reentrancy attacks have become relatively common in the DeFi space. In such an exploit, hackers trick smart contracts by making repeated calls to the protocol and stealing user assets. As a result, Upbit has suspended deposits and withdrawals of the CRV token, while other exchanges have warned users to exercise caution when dealing with investments related to CRV. Upbit had tweeted,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Today, certain vulnerabilities have been discovered in some of the stablecoin pools associated with Curve (CRV). As a result, CRV is currently experiencing significant volatility. We advise exercising caution when considering any investments related to CRV. To ensure the safety of digital asset transactions, we have temporarily suspended deposits and withdrawals for CRV.&rdquo;</p>

Curve And Egorov Find Support&nbsp;
<p>The plummeting CRV price significantly increased the risk of liquidating the loans Egorov took. However, prominent players from the crypto space have stepped in to assist Curve and Egorov. These include Power DeFi user DCF God, Tron Foundation CEO Justin Sun, and Jeffrey Huang, also known as Machi Big Brother. All have since stepped in and purchased CRV tokens from Egorov. As a result of this help, the principal value of Egorov&rsquo;s loan dropped from $63 million to $54 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tron founder Justin Sun tweeted that he was excited to assist Curve, demonstrating his support for the protocol by acquiring a number of CRV tokens. According to available on-chain data, Sun purchased around 5 million CRV tokens worth around $3 million. The tokens were purchased from a wallet called the Curve.fi Founder, and was completed through an over-the-counter transaction. Sun tweeted,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excited to assist Curve! As steadfast partners, we remain committed to providing support whenever needed. Our joint efforts will introduce an @stusdt pool on Curve, amplifying user benefits. Together, we aim to empower the community and forge a decentralized finance!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Other players that chipped in to assist Curve were Cream Finance, who sent Egorov $1 million in USDT and USDC stablecoins. Egorov also received $1.5 million worth of USDT from Jeffrey Huang (Machi Big Brother), according to data sourced from PeckShield. Egorov also transferred over 50 million CRV to other entities, including the Web3 investment firm DWF Labs and Power DeFi user DCF God. Going by these numbers, Egorov sold around 50 million CRV tokens at a price of around $0.4 per token, making the transactions worth close to $20 million.&nbsp;</p>
Major Implications For DeFi&nbsp;
<p>The Curve Finance exploit could have major implications for the larger DeFi ecosystem, with the CRV token&rsquo;s value suffering a significant decline, putting Egorov&rsquo;s $168 million lending position at risk of liquidation. If the position were to be liquidated, it could have a domino effect on the larger DeFi ecosystem. Egorov has a $70 million loan on Aave v2, for which he has used CRV as collateral. Additionally, he has also borrowed $17 worth of FRAX, putting $32 million worth of CRV as collateral, along with another $18 million loan from DeFi protocol Abracadabra.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Concerns about the concentration of CRV on Aave were flagged by Gauntlet, who recommended freezing the token on Aave.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The amount of CRV concentrated on Aave, relative to the circulating supply of CRV, is already high. Given the limitations of V2 mechanisms, including the possibility of circumventing an LTV of 0, the only way to truly prevent more risk of this position is to prevent borrowing of all assets on V2.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Other players that chipped in to assist Curve were Cream Finance, who sent Egorov $1 million in USDT and USDC stablecoins. Egorov also received $1.5 million worth of USDT from Jeffrey Huang (Machi Big Brother), according to data sourced from PeckShield. Egorov also transferred over 50 million CRV to other entities, including the Web3 investment firm DWF Labs and Power DeFi user DCF God. Going by these numbers, Egorov sold around 50 million CRV tokens at a price of around $0.4 per token, making the transactions worth close to $20 million.&nbsp;</p>
Major Implications For DeFi&nbsp;
<p>The Curve Finance exploit could have major implications for the larger DeFi ecosystem, with the CRV token&rsquo;s value suffering a significant decline, putting Egorov&rsquo;s $168 million lending position at risk of liquidation. If the position were to be liquidated, it could have a domino effect on the larger DeFi ecosystem. Egorov has a $70 million loan on Aave v2, for which he has used CRV as collateral. Additionally, he has also borrowed $17 worth of FRAX, putting $32 million worth of CRV as collateral, along with another $18 million loan from DeFi protocol Abracadabra.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Concerns about the concentration of CRV on Aave were flagged by Gauntlet, who recommended freezing the token on Aave.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The amount of CRV concentrated on Aave, relative to the circulating supply of CRV, is already high. Given the limitations of V2 mechanisms, including the possibility of circumventing an LTV of 0, the only way to truly prevent more risk of this position is to prevent borrowing of all assets on V2.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Bankrupt crypto platform, Voyager Digital Holdings Inc., may have been a victim of a hacking attack during the court-supervised process of liquidating assets to repay its customers, according to one of the company's lawyers.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">According to an initial report from Bloomberg, the incident occurred just as the firm reopened its platform, after months of court-led fundraising initiatives, to allow clients to retrieve any residual assets. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">During the 30-day window for withdrawal, customers managed to recover about $490 million in assets, accounting for nearly 80% of the available amount, Voyager's lawyer Darren Azman informed the presiding judge of the Chapter 11 case in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This potential breach has since been reported to law enforcement agencies and is under investigation by bankruptcy officials overseeing the company's liquidation process. Clientts have reportedly been targeted with scams aimed at gaining access to their digital wallets.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">According to Azman, customers were targeted by several scams attempting to infiltrate their digital wallets. These scams typically involved the creation of fraudulent websites, promising customers an increased payout if they linked their non-Voyager cryptocurrency wallets to a newly created account. Upon creating these new accounts, the scammers would proceed to deplete the linked non-Voyager wallets, Azman explained.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Presiding over the telephone-held court hearing, US Bankruptcy Judge Michael Wiles condemned the situation, stating:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"It&rsquo;s disgraceful. I don&rsquo;t know what to say. After everything these folks have been through."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Voyager is the first among a string of bankrupt cryptocurrency firms to commence the repayment of creditors and customers. In April, Binance.US nullified a deal to buy the cryptocurrency platform, which ultimately diminished what customers could recover.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Voyager officials previously projected that customers could recuperate about 36% of what they were owed, or more than 60% if the company prevailed in a court dispute with another bankrupt cryptocurrency firm, FTX Trading. Based on court documents, Voyager possessed about $630 million to settle $1.8 billion in account claims.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Launched sometime in 2018, Voyager rapidly expanded, peaking at 3.5 million users and holding approximately $6 billion worth of cryptocurrency assets, according to court records.</p>
