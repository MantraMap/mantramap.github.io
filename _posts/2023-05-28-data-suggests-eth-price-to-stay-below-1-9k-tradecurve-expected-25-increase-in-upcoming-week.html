<p>Recently, the Ethereum (ETH) price has fluctuated quite a bit. New data suggests its value could stay below $1,900 for a while. While this may come as disappointing news for some investors, it's essential to understand the various factors contributing to it. Today, we will look at those factors while also focusing on Tradecurve (TCRV), as its presale is expected to see another 25% increase in the next seven days.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Ethereum (ETH) remains pegged below $1,900</p>
<p>Ethereum (ETH) has been unable to break through the $1,900 level in the last two weeks. And if we look at the previous price jump, which occurred on May 6 as Ethereum reached $2,000, this fall seems concerning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investor interest has likely decreased because of the $8.80 average transaction price on the Ethereum network, but the global financial situation has also had an impact. On May 22, Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan, said it is hard to foresee how the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, which aims to reduce inflation, will turn out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, there aren't many active addresses interacting with Ethereum decentralized apps. The number of active addresses decreased by 12% in the past month for the top 12 decentralized apps operating on the Ethereum network, potentially due to investor dissatisfaction with the high transaction prices of Ethereum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This data shows us that Ethereum will likely stay below $1,900 for the foreseeable future as it trades hands at $1,783.11 with a market cap of $214B, down 1.83% in the last day alone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tradecurve (TCRV) presale value to soar soon&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Ethereum is struggling as it slowly loses investor appeal, the Tradecurve (TCRV) presale displays a stellar performance. It has already jumped by 20% from its starting price of $0.01, and more price hikes are expected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This project has enamored traders as it could disrupt the online trading market since it will allow all derivatives to be traded on a single account while using cryptocurrency as collateral.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Ethereum-based hybrid trading platform will have privacy and anonymity at the forefront as it will forgo the sign-up KYC requirements that traditional trading platforms such as eToro and Robinhood employ.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Traders from all over the globe may sign up for Tradecurve using an email only and just connecting a crypto wallet to the account - ensuring an utterly private trading environment where they can operate anonymously.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users may subscribe to the Tradecurve automated trading &amp; artificial intelligence (AI) bots with a proven track record that will help them on their trading path. Or, those just beginning may utilize the copy trading feature, which allows users to replicate what experienced traders are doing (for a subscription fee).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Obtaining discounts on these subscriptions can be done by purchasing the utility token of Tradecurve, TCRV, which now has a value of just $0.012. But the presale is now in Stage 2, and price increases occur frequently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next week, for instance, a 25% increase will appear as the value will jump to $0.015. Since demand is high, with millions of tokens sold already, experts predict that TCRV will see a 50x increase as the presale continues advancing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a projected raise of $20M during its presale, Tradecurve will have a grand launch as its utility token may get listed on Uniswap or a major Tier-1 CEX.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to this, a 100x increase can also be seen for TCRV after its launch. Those interested in backing this future top 3 global exchange can sign up for its presale below.&nbsp;</p>
