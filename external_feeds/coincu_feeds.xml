<p>The community has expressed frustration and concern, claiming that the updated system appears to be more sensitive to certain transactions, particularly those involving cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>Mox Bank recently implemented a system upgrade to enhance its security measures and improve overall efficiency. However, the changes seem to have caused unexpected issues for some users, particularly those involved in cryptocurrency transactions.</p>

<p>Numerous Mox Bank customers took to social media platforms and online forums to voice their grievances, reporting that their accounts had been unexpectedly blocked or frozen without any prior notice or explanation. Many of these users are active participants in the <a href="https://coincu.com/200024-hong-kong-considers-launching-hkdg/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coincu.com/200024-hong-kong-considers-launching-hkdg/" rel="noreferrer noopener">cryptocurrency market</a>, engaging in regular buying and selling activities.</p>



<p>Members of the affected community expressed frustration, arguing that they had not violated any terms or engaged in illegal activities. They pointed out that the new system appeared to be excessively sensitive to certain transactions, specifically those involving cryptocurrencies. Users claimed that even routine transactions triggered security alerts, resulting in their accounts being temporarily frozen.</p>

<li><em>Data shows that Web3 ventures in the first quarter of 2023 about $2.8 billion down 80% from the same period last year.</em></li>



<li><em>The figure is estimated at around $4 billion by the end of Q2 and may not be reached due to the <a href="https://coincu.com/199477-vcs-crypto-funding-in-june-hits-lowest-2-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">challenging market</a>.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/238681/web3-venture-funding-dropped-80-in-first-quarter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Block</a>, research data by K33 Research shows that Web3 ventures in the first quarter of 2023 fell 80% year-on-year to just $2.8 billion.</strong></h5>

<p>Anders Helseth, managing director at K33 Research, said that if you look at Web3 and crypto totals, venture capital investment in the first half of 2022 will be $15 billion. However, that figure is estimated at around $4 billion in the first and second quarters of this year and could fall further.</p>



<p>As previously reported, a study by analytics firm K33 Research showed that the number of jobs in the crypto industry has dropped by 10% over the past year (about 190,000 to 210,000).</p>



<p>Nearly 30% of the 190,000 crypto workers live in the US and Asia, and Australia together comprise around 35% of the global crypto workforce. India accounts for 20% of Asia&#8217;s jobs, more than China. Meanwhile, mainland Europe is home to 24% of the world&#8217;s crypto jobs, with the UK leading the region with 13,000.</p>



<p>According to The Block Pro, there was $33.2 billion in blockchain venture funding and 2,453 transactions in 2022.</p>

<p>According to many experts&#8217; predictions, 2023 will be an accumulation period, setting the stage for the next cycle. If history repeats, the market will likely bottom out in the first quarter of 2023 before entering an uptrend in mid-2023.</p>



<p>The market will likely see the strongest growth in 2024 &#8211; 2025 when risk appetite and speculation are strong again. In particular, the firm said the crypto and stock markets will continue to have a positive correlation. For Web3, the SocialFi model is likely a promising trend.</p>



<p>&#8220;The reduction in funding for Web3 is not an imminent threat to the web3 services being built in the coming years, but like all projects, the treasury must be fully charged before it runs out&#8221;. The K33 report states.</p>

<p>A recent research note from New York-based investment firm Berenberg Capital Markets has explained why it is bullish on MicroStrategy (MSTR) and has given a $430 price target.</p>



<p>Berenberg has highlighted that <a href="https://www.microstrategy.com/en" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.microstrategy.com/en" rel="noreferrer noopener">MicroStrategy</a> derives the bulk of its value from the 152,333 <a href="https://coincu.com/201403-grayscale-opposes-sec-approval/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coincu.com/201403-grayscale-opposes-sec-approval/" rel="noreferrer noopener">BTC</a> it held on its books as of June 28. With the BTC halving just a few years away, the analysts predict that a Bitcoin halving rally could see its shares gain significantly in price. According to Berenberg, previous halving cycles have seen the price of Bitcoin surge by a minimum of 682%. At the time of the first Bitcoin halving on November 28, 2012, the price of Bitcoin hovered around $12. However, 367 days later its price peaked at $1,164.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MicroStrategys-Bitcoin-1.webp"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MicroStrategys-Bitcoin-1-1024x576.webp" alt="MicroStrategys Bitcoin 1" class="wp-image-201500" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MicroStrategys-Bitcoin-1-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MicroStrategys-Bitcoin-1-300x169.webp 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MicroStrategys-Bitcoin-1-768x432.webp 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MicroStrategys-Bitcoin-1-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MicroStrategys-Bitcoin-1-750x422.webp 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MicroStrategys-Bitcoin-1-1140x641.webp 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MicroStrategys-Bitcoin-1.webp 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="MicroStrategy&#039;s Bitcoin Bet Pays Off: Berenberg Capital Report 7"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The upcoming halving is scheduled for April 26, 2024, and it will reduce the BTC issuance rate by 50%. This will significantly dampen the velocity at which new BTC enters the crypto market. Based on historical patterns, Berenberg expects that the pre-halving rally would begin about four months from now.</p>



<p>While BTC&#8217;s supply follows a predetermined path, the overall demand for BTC needs to be gauged before anyone can predict the potential magnitude of a future rally. To measure this, the research report looked to the recent surge in spot BTC ETF applications from some of the world&#8217;s largest and highest-profile asset managers as proof that institutional adoption of BTC is on the rise. Thus, the demand for BTC is expected to increase, contributing to a potential rally in the future.</p>

<p>The investor note also drew attention to the pro-Bitcoin remarks made by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink on July 5, where he sounded like &#8220;a high-conviction Bitcoin maximalist.&#8221; This indicates that even large institutional investors are starting to see the value in BTC.</p>



<p>The research report was written by equity analyst Mark Palmer along with associates Matthew Laflash and Hassan Saleem. Shares of MicroStrategy are currently trading for $408, having gained nearly 180% since the beginning of 2023, according to data from TradingView. Meanwhile, the price of BTC has increased 84% since the start of the year. In conclusion, the prospects for MicroStrategy and BTC appear to be very promising, and investors are eagerly watching for the next halving cycle to commence.</p>

<p><strong>Key Ponts:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>OpenSea enhances NFT trading with new OpenSea SDK functions and multichain support.</em></li>



<li><em>Users can retrieve NFTs by collection or contract and access detailed information on ownership and traits.</em></li>



<li><em>Expanded multichain compatibility enables developers to create orders on various chains, expanding trading opportunities.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>OpenSea, the leading NFT marketplace, has <a href="https://twitter.com/apiopensea/status/1678506505170223104" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the introduction of new OpenSea SDK functions and multichain support aimed at improving the overall trading experience for its users.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-603.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="614" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-603-1024x614.png" alt="OpenSea SDK Adds New Support For The Collection Or Contract Retrieval Of NFT" class="wp-image-201492" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-603-1024x614.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-603-300x180.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-603-768x461.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-603-1536x922.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-603-750x450.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-603-1140x684.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-603.png 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="OpenSea SDK Adds New Support For The Collection Or Contract Retrieval Of NFT 9"></a></figure></div>


<p>These updates include streamlined NFT retrieval, enhanced information availability, and expanded multichain order creation capabilities.</p>



<p>Retrieving NFTs from <a href="https://coincu.com/186451-opensea-pro-now-supports-pepe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenSea</a>&#8216;s vast collection has been made more efficient with the introduction of two new OpenSea SDK functions: &#8220;getNFTsByCollection&#8221; and &#8220;getNFTsByContract.&#8221; These functions provide users with swift responses, enabling them to retrieve specific NFTs based on the collection or contract they are associated with. Furthermore, these functions are now available on numerous additional chains, including Polygon and Sepolia, offering users a wider range of options for their NFT exploration.</p>



<p>For those seeking more detailed information on individual NFTs, OpenSea SDK now includes the &#8220;getNFT&#8221; function. This powerful feature enables users to access a wealth of information, such as the list of owners for ERC-1155 tokens, traits associated with the NFT, and even the rarity of the NFT itself. With this added functionality, users can gain deeper insights into the characteristics and value of the NFTs they encounter in the marketplace.</p>

<p>To further enhance the trading experience and cater to the growing demand for multichain compatibility, OpenSea SDK now allows developers to create orders on a broader array of supported chains.</p>



<p>Previously limited to Ethereum, the updated OpenSea SDK facilitates order creation on <a href="https://docs.opensea.io/reference/supported-chains" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">popular chains</a> such as Polygon, Klaytn, BNB Chain, and Arbitrum, among others. This expansion opens up new avenues for traders and collectors to engage in cross-chain transactions, fostering a more diverse and interconnected NFT ecosystem.</p>



<p>OpenSea continues to prioritize user satisfaction and engagement by introducing these latest advancements. The new OpenSea SDK functions, along with the expanded multichain support, reflect OpenSea&#8217;s commitment to empowering its community and offering seamless access to the world of digital assets and unique NFTs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Aave DAO is considering launching GHO stablecoin on Ethereum, introducing facilitators for enhanced functionality.</em></li>



<li><em>The proposal aims to expand the Aave ecosystem and generate revenue for the DAO through GHO borrowing.</em></li>



<li><em>Users can mint GHO against collateral, and the DAO governs interest rates and financial framework.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Aave DAO, the decentralized autonomous organization governing the Aave Protocol, is currently evaluating a proposal to introduce GHO, an Aave native stablecoin, on the Ethereum Mainnet. The proposal also suggests the implementation of two facilitators, namely the Aave V3 Ethereum Facilitator and the FlashMinter Facilitator, to enhance the functionality of GHO. If approved, this initiative would mark a significant milestone for the Aave ecosystem and the Aave DAO.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-599.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="573" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-599-1024x573.png" alt="Aave DAO Aims To Launch GHO On Ethereum Mainnet Through Aave V3" class="wp-image-201483" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-599-1024x573.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-599-300x168.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-599-768x430.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-599-1536x859.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-599-750x419.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-599-1140x638.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-599.png 1788w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Aave DAO Aims To Launch GHO On Ethereum Mainnet Through Aave V3 11"></a></figure></div>


<p>Following extensive community discussions, multiple phases of the Aave DAO governance process, and rigorous testing on Ethereum&#8217;s Goerli Testnet, the proposal aims to bring GHO to the Ethereum Mainnet alongside the Aave V3 Facilitator and FlashMinter Facilitator.</p>



<p>If the <a href="https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=268" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proposal</a> is approved, users of <a href="https://coincu.com/181775-aave-v3-temperature-check-vote/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aave V3</a> on Ethereum will have the ability to mint <a href="https://coincu.com/192940-aave-proposes-launching-gho-stablecoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GHO</a> against their collateral, ushering in a new era for the Aave ecosystem and the Aave DAO.</p>



<p>The introduction of GHO is expected to enhance stablecoin borrowing on the Aave Protocol, creating more competition and generating additional revenue for the Aave DAO. Notably, 100% of the interest payments made on GHO borrows will be directed to the DAO treasury.</p>



<p>Once GHO is launched, the Aave DAO will have the authority to adjust GHO&#8217;s interest rate through a decentralized governance process, ensuring the stablecoin&#8217;s financial framework remains managed by the DAO.</p>

<p>The concept of Facilitators is introduced with the introduction of GHO. These facilitators, such as protocols or entities, can generate and burn GHO tokens up to a specified bucket size. The proposal combines two previously approved Facilitators, the Aave V3 Ethereum Pool Facilitator and the FlashMinter, with their initial parameters for approval.</p>



<p>The Aave V3 Ethereum Pool Facilitator will enable depositors to borrow GHO against their collateral held in the V3 Ethereum Mainnet Pool. The proposed initial parameters for GHO in the Aave V3 Ethereum Pool include a borrow rate of 1.5%, a bucket capacity of 100 million GHO, and a 30% stkAAVE discount rate.</p>



<p>The FlashMinter Facilitator, subject to community approval, will provide users with the ability to FlashMint GHO, allowing for efficient arbitrage and bolstering GHO&#8217;s peg maintenance. The FlashMinter Facilitator&#8217;s initial bucket capacity will be set at 2 million GHO, with no fees paid to the facilitator initially.</p>



<p>The proposal encompasses various actions, including the deployment of the GHO ERC20 token and transferring control over the smart contract to the Aave DAO, listing GHO as a borrowable asset on the <a href="https://coincu.com/192587-aave-to-completely-remove-busd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aave Protocol</a>, enrolling the Aave V3 Ethereum Pool as the first Facilitator, deploying GhoFlashMinter and enrolling it as the second Facilitator, and configuring stkAAVE as the discount token for GHO&#8217;s borrow rate.</p>



<p>The Aave DAO is eagerly awaiting community input and approval to move forward with the launch of GHO, an initiative set to expand the Aave ecosystem and bolster the Aave DAO&#8217;s revenue streams.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>As soon as the token was successfully launched, Arkham was warned by users about revealing user information.</em></li>



<li><em>The project&#8217;s referral link contains a single line of code that can be easily reversed and revealed the invitee&#8217;s email.</em></li>



<li><em>Arkham has confirmed that the platform is only doing this for the convenience of tracking user referrals and airdrop rewards.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In several warnings that went viral on Twitter earlier today, the Arkham project&#8217;s referral link was having a bug that could potentially leak users&#8217; emails.</strong></h5>

</div></figure>



<p>Specifically, Arkham&#8217;s Referral Link contains a line of code that can be easily converted back and revealed the invitee&#8217;s email.</p>



<p>Attention is drawn to one of the recently announced platforms called <a href="https://twitter.com/ArkhamIntel/status/1678339355314900992" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arkham Intel Exchange</a> that allows users to buy and sell data of other crypto users, via smart contracts. Specifically, with this platform users can open an offer to buy information, and set a reward for it. Those who want to receive the reward will have to collect eligible on-chain information, such as data about an investor&#8217;s wallet or VC fund, or trace the stolen funds from their wallet.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s why it is rumored that the platform may have recorded its own user data, including wallet address association, device id, location, etc. They then mix that data with public data culled from public sources.</p>

<p>Arkham thinks this will address the current crypto users&#8217; need for blockchain information, as many individuals in the community have reached a high level of proficiency in on-chain tools, forming a marketplace &#8220;intel-to-earn&#8221;.</p>



<p>Currently, some argue that Arkham&#8217;s new platform is going against the decentralization of blockchain, which will pose a risk of infringing on the privacy of crypto users. In the opposite direction, many also question how Arkham ensures the accuracy of the information collected.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Dubai reprimands BitOasis, a top Middle Eastern crypto platform, for not meeting regulatory conditions.</em></li>



<li><em>BitOasis faces potential license revocation after failing to comply with mandated requirements.</em></li>



<li><em>Global crackdown on crypto companies intensifies as Dubai takes action, emphasizing the importance of regulatory compliance.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>BitOasis, one of the largest cryptocurrency platforms catering to customers in the Middle East, is facing reprimand from Dubai authorities for failing to meet the mandated conditions outlined by the local regulator.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-593.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="900" height="500" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-593.png" alt="Dubai&#039;s Crypto Giant BitOasis Faces Severe Reprimand" class="wp-image-201470" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-593.png 900w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-593-300x167.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-593-768x427.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-593-750x417.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" title="Dubai&#039;s Crypto Giant BitOasis Faces Severe Reprimand 15"></a></figure></div>


<p>The emirate&#8217;s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) issued a market alert on Monday, announcing its enforcement action against the crypto exchange.</p>



<p>According to the alert sent to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-10/crypto-exchange-bitoasis-faces-reprimand-from-dubai-regulators" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg News</a></em>, BitOasis is under review for its failure to satisfy the required conditions within the specified 30-60 day timeframes before engaging in any VARA-regulated market activities.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, the crypto exchange had obtained Dubai&#8217;s initial &#8220;minimum viable product operational licenses,&#8221; but the regulator now hints at potential actions, including the revocation of BitOasis&#8217; license to operate.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-594.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-594-1024x683.png" alt="Dubai&#039;s Crypto Giant BitOasis Faces Severe Reprimand" class="wp-image-201471" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-594-1024x683.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-594-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-594-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-594-750x500.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-594-1140x760.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-594.png 1350w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Dubai&#039;s Crypto Giant BitOasis Faces Severe Reprimand 16"></a></figure></div>


<p>Upon receiving the license, <a href="https://coincu.com/191934-bitoasis-exchange-reviews-buy-and-sell/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BitOasis</a> had planned to provide broker-dealer services for digital assets to qualified retail and institutional investors from its Dubai headquarters under VARA&#8217;s regulatory regime, as stated in the company&#8217;s previous statement. However, the exchange declined to comment on the VARA alert, while Dubai regulators have yet to respond to requests for comment.</p>



<p>This reprimand is the latest in a series of enforcement actions taken against cryptocurrency companies worldwide. In April, VARA issued a written reprimand to the co-founders of the now-bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, Kyle Davies, and Su Zhu, as well as to Mark Lamb, Sudhu Arumugam, and Leslie Lamb, in connection with the activities of digital-asset exchange <a href="https://coincu.com/191524-3ac-founders-opnx-announces-celsius-claims-trading-now-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OPNX</a>.</p>

<p>As Coincu <a href="https://coincu.com/190159-dubai-considers-new-crypto-law/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, Dubai&#8217;s finance regulator said that it intends to revise crypto restrictions that have been in operation in the city&#8217;s mall since November of last year. The guidelines may be published later this year. Several cryptocurrency firms prefer to execute a wide range of operations under one roof, which concerns Dubai authorities.</p>



<p>The global crackdown on crypto companies highlights the growing scrutiny faced by the industry and the regulatory efforts to ensure compliance and investor protection.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Moroccan individual prosecuted by the US DOJ for creating a fake OpenSea website and selling illegally acquired NFTs.</em></li>



<li><em>The person used spoofing tactics to trick victims into giving access to their crypto wallets.</em></li>



<li><em>Charges include stealing digital assets, including NFTs, from collections like Bored Ape Yacht Club, potentially leading to a long prison sentence if convicted.</em></li>

<p>According to a DOJ statement, Soufiane Oulahyane, 25, reportedly bought for advertising that ranked his spoof <a href="https://coincu.com/187802-new-nft-phishing-scam-opensea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenSea</a> website #1 in search engine results for &#8220;OpenSea,&#8221; and then enticed victims to give over the keys to their private crypto wallets.</p>



<p>The indictment, announced by the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, accuses Moroccan citizen Soufiane Oulahyane of running a website identical to the platform and getting unlawful access to digital assets and NFTs using a cybercrime tactic known as &#8220;spoofing.&#8221; The individual utilized the bogus OpenSea website to entice Manhattan NFT holders to join up and provide the seed phrase to his digital wallet, following which he transferred and sold bitcoins and a huge number of NFTs under his control. One of these NFTs is from the <a href="https://coincu.com/159867-bored-ape-yacht-club-launch-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bored Ape Yacht Club</a> collection.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;&#8216;Spoofing’ is one of the oldest tricks in the criminal playbook. Oulahyane adapted this old tool for use in a new and developing arena—the crypto space,&#8221; U.S. District Attorney for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams said in a statement.</p>

<p>Authorities accused him of stealing $450,000 in digital assets from a Manhattan resident and others in September 2021. Because of the victims&#8217; location, they have jurisdiction over the matter and have filed charges.</p>



<p>Oulahyane is now being held in Moroccan detention. He was charged with wire fraud, using an unlawful access device, aggravated identity theft, and altering transactions using an access device to obtain anything worth $1,000 or more. If proven guilty, Oulahyane may face decades in jail.</p>

<p>According to the announcement, MINA deposit support will open within 3 hours of posting the notice. However, MINA only supports deposits from the Mina network, and deposits through other networks, such as BSC, are not supported. For the first one-time MINA deposit, except for 1 MINA, the amount deposited is deposited out of the total amount deposited due to the characteristics of the MINA network and wallet address.</p>



<p>In order to provide a safe trading environment and accurate market information to members, orders under the following conditions are restricted after adding a new digital asset to the BTC market. The transaction support start time is 16:00 on July 11, 2023. The initial purchase order is limited to about 5 minutes when adding a new digital asset. </p>



<p>The sell orders for MINA are limited to -10% or less of the previous day&#8217;s closing price (0.00001494 BTC) on CoinMarketCap. When adding a new digital asset, the market price and pre-order are limited for about an hour.</p>



<p>As of July 11, 08:50 (KST), the price of the new digital asset confirmed on CoinMarketCap is 0.00001532 BTC. It is important to note this point and be mindful of losses due to rapid market price fluctuations in the initial stage of transaction support.</p>



<p>Mina is a layer-1 blockchain with a 22KB blockchain and zero-knowledge smart contracts (&#8220;zkApps&#8221;) written in TypeScript. The Mina Protocol uses zero-knowledge proofs to build an ideal blockchain architecture. Unlike early blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Mina&#8217;s blockchain always remains a constant size of about 22KB, which is the size of a few tweets. It is possible to verify the current consensus state of the protocol using one recursive, 22KB zero-knowledge proof. This means participants can quickly sync and verify the current consensus state of the network.</p>

<p><strong>Key points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Lending Blur&#8217;s NFT, Blend will add support for the Azuki Elementals and Elemental Beans NFT lines.</em></li>



<li><em>This allows all transactions (and farmers) to sell with 0% royalties leading to inefficiencies.</em></li>



<li><em>Blur and Azuki Elementals are both entangled in public criticism.</em></li>
</ul>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to official news, Blur, <a href="https://blur.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blend&#8217;s</a> NFT loan agreement will add support for the Azuki Elementals and Elemental Beans NFT lines.

<p>Users share that the 0.5% royalty fee will keep the market participants more honest, but with Blend, this fee is not lost, this makes the participants dump, leading to the remaining ones not receiving opportunity costs, ultimately inefficient and losing trades. That can worsen the current price reduction trend of new collections in Azuki&#8217;s ecosystem.</p>

<p>As previously updated, despite raising $38 million in just 15 minutes of opening, the anime-style irreplaceable token collection &#8220;still hasn&#8217;t hit the mark&#8221; envisioned for the sequel New Elementals NFT. However, some Azuki NFT owners have expressed disappointment that the new Elemental collection looks just like the previous one, causing the price to <a href="https://coincu.com/199468-azuki-nft-floor-price-dropped-54-last-7-days/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drop</a> significantly on June 28, 2023.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-586.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="470" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-586.png" alt="Blur&#039;s Lending Platform Blend Will Support 2 New Azuki NFT Lines" class="wp-image-201448" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-586.png 800w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-586-300x176.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-586-768x451.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-586-750x441.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" title="Blur&#039;s Lending Platform Blend Will Support 2 New Azuki NFT Lines 23"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Besides, the problems in the minting process also made the new collection Elementals this time undervalued. The floor price of Azuki also dropped by about 20% long after the publisher Chiru Labs announced the new collection Elementals.</p>



<p>Since this collapse has followed a series of other famous collections, such as CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club, Mutant Ape Yacht Club, Doodles, and Cool Cats, have been affected and drastically reduced in price. According to data from CoinGecko, these collections have dropped between 18-33% in the past 3 days (June 10-13).</p>



<p>The NFT market has fallen into chaos, causing the Blur NFT Marketplace to receive many accusations that this trading platform has caused the price of NFT to plummet recently.</p>



<p>The community points its axes at Blur as many whales use the platform to manipulate prices and farm airdrops on Blur. Some other opinions suggest that Azuki&#8217;s intense sell-offs are partly due to the lending platform developed by Blur itself.</p>
