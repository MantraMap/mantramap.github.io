<p class="md-end-block md-p">U.S. bankruptcy judge Brendan Shannon has approved cryptocurrency exchange Bittrex's request for a $7 million loan in Bitcoin (BTC) from its parent company, Aquila Holdings, according to a Reuters report on May 10. The loan aims to facilitate the smooth running of the company's bankruptcy process without disrupting its customers.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">According to a report from Reuters, Bittrex will be allowed to borrow 250 BTC, currently valued at $7 million. The exchange also plans to request an additional 450 BTC loan in a June hearing, which could bring the total value of the loans to $19 million if Bitcoin's price remains stable. Bittrex asserts that it can pay back all its customers in cryptocurrency, but the loan will help ensure the bankruptcy process proceeds without complications.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Judge Shannon agreed to the Bitcoin loan due to the cryptocurrency's unique features, such as low interest rates and built-in volatility protections. Bittrex will not be required to repay more than 110% of Bitcoin's current value when the loan is due.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The loan comes after Bittrex announced its decision to file for U.S. bankruptcy on May 8 without ceasing its global operations. The company cited regulatory challenges and reported its assets and liabilities to be between $500 million and $1 billion, with over 100,000 creditors. Bittrex's trading volume in the past 24 hours stands at $7.2 million.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The bankruptcy filing comes in the wake of the U.S. Securities and Exchanbge Commission (SEC) charging Bittrex for operating an unregistered securities exchange. As a result, Bittrex stopped accepting new deposits from U.S. customers and advised existing users to withdraw their crypto from the platform. The company's U.S. operations accounted for a minority of its overall user base, with affiliated exchanges in Liechtenstein and Bermuda representing about 77% of its 5.4 million users as of March 27, according to court documents.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Bittrex's attorney, Susheel Kirpalani, emphasized during the court hearing that the bankruptcy loan would ensure a seamless wind-down of the company while protecting customer assets. The loan, granted on an interim basis, allows Bittrex to borrow 250 Bitcoin from its non-bankrupt parent company Aquila Holdings. The total value of the proposed loan could reach $19.7 million, based on Bitcoin prices at the time of the bankruptcy filing.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Judge Shannon's approval of the loan, despite it being a "novel currency," was influenced by the favorable terms compared to other bankruptcy loans, including a relatively low 4% interest rate and built-in protections related to Bitcoin's price volatility. Bittrex intends to repay the loan in Bitcoin, with a provision that it will not be forced to pay more than 110% of Bitcoin's current value if it must acquire more Bitcoin to make loan repayments, as stated in the court documents.</p>
