<li>Bitcoin price is correcting losses from the $27,000 zone against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>The price is now trading near $28,500 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $29,250 on the 4-hour chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $29,250 resistance zone.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Bitcoin price is rising from $27,000 against the US Dollar. BTC might eye another increase if the bulls remain active above the $27,000 zone.</em></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price Analysis</h2>
<p>Bitcoin price started a fresh decline below the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-eyes-more-gains-above-31k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">$30,000 support zone</a>. There was a clear move below the $29,500 and $29,200 support levels. The pair even tested the $27,000 support zone.</p>
<p>It traded as low as $26,965 and recently started a fresh increase. There was a break above the $27,250 resistance zone. The price gained pace once it broke the $28,000 resistance zone and the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $31,050 swing high to the $26,695 low.</p>
<p>Bitcoin price is now trading near $28,500 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-rally-loses-steam-above-30k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $29,000 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $31,050 swing high to the $26,695 low.</p>
<p>There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $29,250 on the 4-hour chart of the BTC/USD pair. The next major resistance might be near the $29,450 zone.</p>
<p>A clear move above the trend line and $29,450 might send the price toward $30,000, above which the price might rise toward the $31,200 level. Any more gains might push the price toward the $32,500 zone. If there is no upside break, the price might start a fresh decline below the $28,000 level.</p>
<p>The first major support is near $27,200. The next key support is near the $27,000 level, below which the price might accelerate lower. In the stated case, the price could decline toward the $26,500 level.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier today, we <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/mike-cagney-on-what-makes-blockchain-special/" data-wpel-link="internal">published an article</a> about Mike Cagney, the cofounder of Sofi. He also runs the Provenance blockchain, and there’s big news surrounding the network in that it’s launching a new $50 million HASH development grant to establish <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/03/21/provenance-blockchain-foundation-announces-50-million-grant-program/?sh=7bd99631232c" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">core services and experiences</a> on the blockchain.</p>
<h2>Provenance Blockchain Has Big Plans for the Future</h2>
<p>The grant comes by way of a new partnership formed between Provenance and Apollo, an asset management firm that controls more than half a trillion in overall assets. Not long ago, John Zito – the senior partner and deputy CIO of credit at Apollo – commented on what both entities are planning for the future:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are excited to work with Mike and his team at Figure on [several] initiatives using Provenance blockchain technology specifically developed for our industry. This collaboration extends Apollo’s strategy of working with best-in-class fintech firms to seek the operational and cost benefits that blockchain and other technologies can bring to bear.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Provenance blockchain is presently utilized by more than 60 separate financial institutions and fintech enterprises. Right now, the network has close to $10 billion in asset value locked within its confines. CEO Morgan McKenney says it’s different from other layer-1 blockchains in that it purely tries to service regulated monetary platforms on a regular basis. He commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>As we add asset classes, we add other participants to the ecosystem. We have private funds live on-chain that bring accredited investors. We have a lot of lending, mortgage and HELOCs, which brings bank and credit union buyers, and mortgage providers white labeling their services through Figure Technologies. Infrastructure lending brings in insurance companies and pensions… The grant program is so important because it brings developers to support the asset lifecycle. Our team has deep financial services knowledge as well as an amazing engineering team that’s trying to develop the protocol in ways that are competitively advantaged… We are enabling the crowdsourcing of the future of finance.</p></blockquote>
<p>About nine years ago, CEO of JPMorgan Chase Jamie Dimon warned that the banks of the modern era were becoming too entwined with the world of growing tech companies. Many of these enterprises were too speculative and volatile to be given all the attention they were receiving, and he warned this would come back to bite the banking industry in the rear (which it clearly has given how many institutions from <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/as-more-banks-fell-bitcoin-rose-beyond-28k/" data-wpel-link="internal">Signature to Silvergate</a> have crashed and burned as of late). He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>When I go to Silicon Valley…they all want to eat our lunch. Every single one of them is going to try.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Banks and Tech&#8230; Not a Great Combo</h2>
<p>He reiterated his sentiment five years later, commenting:</p>
<blockquote><p>I tell our people, don’t guess, you know they’re there, you know they’re coming, you know they want to eat our lunch. Assume it.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fidelity Investments and Black Rock – two of the biggest investing companies in the world – are slowly expanding their reaches <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/03/21/14-trillion-earthquake-fidelity-and-blackrock-are-quietly-laying-the-groundwork-for-the-next-bitcoin-ethereum-and-crypto-price-bull-run/?sh=63a7ce4a6759" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">into the crypto and blockchain</a> spaces.</p>
<h2>Fidelity and Black Rock Are the New Crypto Leaders</h2>
<p>Fidelity has long been a crypto player, going <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/fidelity-is-still-taking-flak-for-its-crypto-offerings/" data-wpel-link="internal">so far as to last year</a>, when the space was enduring its biggest bear run in history, allow retirees and those with 401K funds to their names to use their hard-earned money to invest in digital assets like BTC and Ethereum. This move caught a lot of people off guard and even made certain individuals – such as democrat senator from Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren – very angry.</p>
<p>But this hasn’t stopped the company from moving forward. Fidelity has long commented that crypto is the wave of the future, and it’s not about to prevent people from getting involved early. It and Black Rock are now leading the charge for standard financial investment firms to grow alongside the arena. Larry Fink – the chief executive of Black Rock – explained in a letter to investors:</p>
<blockquote><p>At BlackRock we continue to explore the digital assets ecosystem, especially areas most relevant to our clients such as permissioned blockchains and tokenization of stocks and bonds. Very interesting developments are happening in the digital asset space.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin is already up more <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/as-more-banks-fell-bitcoin-rose-beyond-28k/" data-wpel-link="internal">than 50 percent from</a> where it ended 2022, and it’s reached a nine-month high. Last year was arguably the worst year for digital assets, with the space losing more than $2 trillion in valuation and currencies such as bitcoin dropping by more than 70 percent. The asset had reached a new all-time high of about $68,000 per unit in November of 2021, though about 12 months later, the currency had dropped into the $16K range. It was a sad and ugly sight to see.</p>
<p>Now, however, BTC – at the time of writing – has shot up to about $28K per unit. This isn’t where it was two Novembers ago, but it’s a step up from where it sat last December, that’s for sure, and many asset holders are starting to once again hold a strong belief that there’s more to crypto than meets the eye.</p>
<p>Next year, another bitcoin halving will be upon us, and some analysts are convinced that what we’re witnessing today could be attributed to the anticipation many investors and traders are beginning to feel about the event. It is well documented that prior to every halving, BTC incurs a solid price boost, and some believe this time around will be no exception.</p>
<h2>The Next Halving Is Coming</h2>
<p>Alex Thorn – Galaxy’s head of research – said in emailed comments:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’re about a year away from bitcoin’s next halving. Historically, these have been bullish events for the digital asset.</p></blockquote>
<p>The next halving is currently scheduled to happen a year from now (April of 2024).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mike Cagney has made a <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/savingandinvesting/future-of-finance-figure-s-cagney-says-blockchain-for-payments-nearing-tipping-point/ar-AA18HxQM" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">real name for himself</a> in the blockchains pace. He is the co-founder of Sofi and the current CEO of Figure. He’s also made public the Provenance blockchain, which has supported about $12 million in transactions at the time of writing.</p>
<h2>Mike Cagney on Blockchain</h2>
<p>In a recent interview, he talked about just how prominent <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/blockchain/" data-wpel-link="internal">blockchain</a> is. He also delved a bit into what his company does, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the most important roles that I play with Figure and supporting the Provenance ecosystem is just evangelizing the use cases for blockchain and trying to make them as tangible and accessible as possible. The most fundamental thing that we strive for is the idea that blockchain allows you to displace trust with truth, so it allows you to create native digital assets where I can look at those assets and know for certain their ownership composition and history, and it allows you to transact bilaterally so that you and I can transact without an intermediate.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cagney has always been positive when it comes to blockchain, and this is a narrative he’s carried with him since his early Sofi days. He mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>When I was at Sofi, I talked a lot about blockchain, but I didn&#8217;t really understand what it was and what the power of it was, so I just had an aha moment of this disintermediation construct, where I said, ‘Wait a minute, this is huge. This is probably one of the most transformative technologies that we’ll experience in our lifetime.’</p></blockquote>
<p>Addressing the lack of women working in blockchain and crypto, he mentioned the following about what is largely a male-dominated industry:</p>
<blockquote><p>We achieved a lot of great things at Sofi, and we learned a lot as well. We have taken those learnings with us in starting Figure, particularly around culture. One of the biggest changes we incorporated at Figure is hiring people for culture first. When you prioritize ability and skill set during recruitment, you can often leave culture as an afterthought. That then leads to an environment where bad behaviors are tolerated when they shouldn&#8217;t be, simply because they&#8217;re coming from top performers. Our president and head of lending are both women, and that diversity transcends through not just the executive team but also the organization, where we have higher representation of women in product and engineering than tech/fintech averages.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Joining Banks and Crypto Together</h2>
<p>He concluded with:</p>
<blockquote><p>When we built Provenance and made it public, we went to a bunch of banks early on, and my thesis was, ‘Hey, you could do a securitization on here and save, you know, roughly 90 basis points,’ and every bank universally said, ‘This is great. We love it. We&#8217;d like to be the 10th bank to do a securitization on here.’</p></blockquote>

<li>ADA price is trading in a bearish zone below the $0.42 support zone against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>The price is now trading below $0.40 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.3850 on the 4-hour chart (data feed via Coinbase).</li>
<li>The price could continue to move down if it stays below the $0.40 resistance zone.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Cardano price is struggling below $0.40 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-eyes-more-gains-above-31k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a>. ADA price could start a fresh increase if it clears the $0.385 and $0.400 resistance levels.</em></p>
<h2>Cardano Price Analysis</h2>
<p>In the past few days, Cardano price saw a fresh decline from the $0.465 zone against the US Dollar. The ADA/USD pair declined below the $0.425 and $0.420 support levels.</p>
<p>The price even declined below the $0.400 support and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/cardano-ada-price-analysis-rally-could-resume-above-0-45/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. It revisited the $0.3750 support zone. A low is formed near $0.3763 and the price is consolidating losses. It is now trading below $0.40 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</p>
<p>Besides, there is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.3850 on the 4-hour chart. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $0.3850 zone. The first major resistance is near the $0.400 level or the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.4625 swing high to the $0.3763 low.</p>
<p>A clear upside break above the $0.400 level might send the price toward the $0.415 resistance. Any more gains could start a steady increase toward the $0.420 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.4625 swing high to the $0.3763 low.</p>
<p>On the downside, immediate support is near the $0.375 level. The next major support is near the $0.365 level, below which the price may perhaps decline toward the $0.350 support level. Any more losses might call for a test of the $0.320 level.</p>

<li>Ethereum price is struggling to recover above the $1,900 resistance against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>ETH price is now trading below $1,900 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,850 on the 4-hour chart (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair could recover, but it is likely to face sellers near the $1,950 resistance zone.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Ethereum price is declining below $1,900 against the US Dollar. ETH/USD remains at a risk of more downsides below the $1,800 support zone.</em></p>
<h2>Ethereum Price Analysis</h2>
<p>This past week, Ethereum struggled to clear the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-eth-holds-key-uptrend-support-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">$2,050 resistance zone</a> against the US Dollar. ETH price attempted a few times to clear the $2,050 level but failed.</p>
<p>A swing high was formed near $2,142 and the price started a fresh decline. There was a drop below the $1,920 and $1,900 support levels. The pair even spiked below the $1,850 support. A low is formed near $1,805 and the price is now consolidating losses.</p>
<p>It is now trading below $1,900 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours). On the upside, the price is now facing resistance near the $1,850 level. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,850 on the 4-hours chart.</p>
<p>The 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,142 swing high to the $1,805 low is also above the trend line. The next major resistance is near the $1,950 level or the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-eth-rally-could-extend-above-2000/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>.</p>
<p>The next major resistance is near the $1,975 zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,142 swing high to the $1,805 low. A clear move above the $1,950 and $1,975 resistance levels might call for a fresh move to $2,050. Any more gains could even send the price toward the $2,140 resistance zone or even $2,250 in the near term.</p>
<p>On the downside, initial support is near the $1,800 level. The next major support is now near the $1,770 level. A break below the $1,770 support could push the price to $1,720. If the bulls fail to protect the $1,720 support, the price might decline toward $1,650.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2023/04/Ethereum-3.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-78052" src="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2023/04/Ethereum-3.png" alt="Ethereum Price" width="1834" height="845" /></a></p>
<p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSD/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="exclude">chart</a>, Ethereum price is trading below $1,900 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).

<h2>Technical indicators</h2>
<p>4 hours MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is now gaining momentum in the bearish zone.</p>
<p>4 hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For what appears to be the first time in about 24 months, many crypto heads and analysts are saying bitcoin – the world’s number one digital currency by market cap – <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/crypto-market-witnesses-odd-relationship-between-bitcoin-ether-volatility-metrics-1032178382" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">will be more volatile</a> in the coming future than its closest relative Ethereum, which has long been the number two crypto and bitcoin’s primary competitor.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Is on the Verge of Beating Ethereum in the Volatility Dept.</h2>
<p>The funny thing about a statement like this is that throughout its short history, Ethereum has always been more volatile than its daddy. This is largely because the asset came second and has a lot less experience in the space. It is also largely reflective of a secondary market which usually finds itself victimized by macroeconomic problems.</p>
<p>Still, per new technical analyses of both assets, it appears bitcoin is more likely to endure hardcore swings in the coming months than Ethereum. Jeff Anderson, chief banking officer at quantitative trading firm and liquidity provider Folkvang, commented in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin is in the spotlight again as cracks in [the] fractional reserve banking system cause distrust in fiat systems. Bitcoin dominance has ripped higher this month as the market scrambles for hard money and protection from impending fiat supply inflation.</p></blockquote>
<p>The discussion also comes at an odd time given how strong bitcoin has been over the last two months. BTC endured a very harsh 2022 given that in November of 2021, it reached a new all-time high of about $68,000 per unit, and just 12 months later, the currency had fallen into the mid-$16K range. That’s a loss of more than 70 percent in just a single year.</p>
<p>Sadly, many additional assets (including Ethereum) chose to follow in its footsteps and contribute further to the crashes of the space, thus causing the digital currency industry to lose more than $2 trillion in overall valuation. It was a sad and ugly sight to see.</p>
<p>However, at the time of writing, the US and Europe are enduring harsh <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/as-more-banks-fell-bitcoin-rose-beyond-28k/" data-wpel-link="internal">banking crises</a> that have caused several financial platforms (i.e., Silvergate Bank, Silicon Valley Bank, and Signature Bank) to crash and burn within a few weeks of each other. During this period, bitcoin is enjoying a nine-month high and is trading in the $28K range, up roughly $12K from where it ended 2022.</p>
<p>Patrick Chu – director of institutional sales and trading at over-the-counter crypto tech platform Paradigm – threw his two cents into the conversation, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>The negative spread is reflective of the two assets increasingly viewed as similar, yet different proxies of risk. Both markets are much deeper and liquid than the rest of the coins with established use cases.</p></blockquote>
<h2>What Will Happen After the Next Upgrade?</h2>
<p>Jeff Anderson finished with:</p>
<blockquote><p>I do think there is real value in owning ETH variance into the Shanghai upgrade. The event risk there is underpriced, and options appear cheap.</p></blockquote>

Despite everything that happened in 2022 and how bearish the market was, the space’s volatility and speculation has not put the owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team off from putting everything he has into bitcoin, the world’s number one digital currency by market cap.</p>
<h2>Mark Cuban Still Loves BTC</h2>
<p>In a recent interview with Bill Maher, a famed talk show host, Cuban claimed that owning gold was the wrong way to go despite its reputation for being a hedge fund over the years. He says that gold, in many ways, is nowhere near as safe as BTC given that when you purchase gold, you don’t really own the bar, and thus your status as a gold possessor is always in question. For this reason, he continues to push bitcoin and its alleged benefits. Cuban said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I want bitcoin to go down a lot further so I can buy some more.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maher claimed to be very “anti-bitcoin” in the discussion, and said that he’s a gold owner. Cuban quickly rebuked this by saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you have gold, you&#8217;re dumb… Gold is not a hedge against anything, right? What it is, [it’s] a store of value and you don&#8217;t own the physical gold, do you? Gold is a store of value and so is bitcoin.</p></blockquote>
<p>He further stated that during times of crises, gold will not protect your wealth or portfolio the way it’s been touted to all these years. He commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>You don&#8217;t own the gold bar, and if everything went to hell in a handbasket and you had a gold bar, you know what would happen? Someone would beat the f*ck out of you or kill you and take your gold bar.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin investing appears to be returning to form in recent months given the state of the current <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/as-more-banks-fell-bitcoin-rose-beyond-28k/" data-wpel-link="internal">banking system in the</a> United States. Three banks (Silvergate, Signature, and Silicon Valley) have all crumbled within a few short weeks of each other, and many traders have since shot back to speculative assets – such as BTC – out of fear that the centralized, standard monetary system they’ve all grown up with is suddenly losing its legs.</p>
<h2>So Many Banks Are Failing</h2>
<p>With BTC now on the rise as so many smaller banks fail, it makes sense that the digital asset is on the verge of making a serious comeback. After all, we cannot forget that BTC was a quick and out-of-the-blue answer to the 2008 financial crisis, so it makes sense that bitcoin would endure heavy spikes (it’s already at a nine-month high) when so many traditional financial enterprises are crashing and burning.</p>
<p>During 2022, BTC lost more than 70 percent from its all-time high of $68K per unit.</p>
