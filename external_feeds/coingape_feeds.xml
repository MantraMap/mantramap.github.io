In fact, the criticism Gensler faced during the hearing could act as a validation of long pending demand for regulatory clarity in the crypto market space. The lawmakers not only questioned the status quo but also sought Gensler&#8217;s opinion on the legal framework behind crypto assets.</p>

<p>Several Congressmen expressed the need for immediate resolution to the regulatory issues surrounding trade of cryptocurrencies in the United States. Hence, it is possible that Gensler could face more of such Congressional hearings in that pursuit. But whether such hearings will further delay outcome from the legal route in crypto related lawsuits remains to be seen.</p>
<h2>Ripple Lawsuit Summary Judgement Delay</h2>
<p>After the ruling in the Ripple Vs SEC lawsuit in March 2022, experts have been predicting that the Summary Judgement could be out any time before May 6, 2020, which marks a 60 days period. However, it is highly unpredictable as to when Judge Analisa Torres gives out the judgement, especially after the Gary Gensler Congressional hearing led to a widespread debate in the mainstream. XRP influencer Mr Huber <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/Leerzeit/status/1650517409499959305?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> there could be many more Congressional hearings of the SEC Chair before the Summary Judgement ruling.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think it is likely that there will be several more congressional hearings of Gensler and his successor before Torres even starts working on her Summary Judgement ruling.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Overall, the Congressional hearing&#8217;s impact on Court rulings cannot be overruled, in favor of Ripple and the 76,000 XRP holders.</p>

Generally, this trend is associated with a corresponding price surge for the asset. However, this could also be seen as the big whales trying to cash out at current price anticipating a bear run in days to come. Nevertheless, BTC price is still at the highest level in the last 12 months and hence the bear run case may also be justified.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) for long term Bitcoin holders shows high confidence in a price rise. On chain data <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/64466eec10b8f142c0af3263-Long-term-holder-sopr-suggests-that-we-are-in-a-recovery-phase" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggests</a> that BTC investors who have been holding since 5 months are currently in realized losses but what follows is a recovery period. Overall, this is a good sign for long term, despite potential for volatility in the short term.</p>
<h2>Dormant Bitcoin Whales Awaken</h2>
<p>Over the last one week, at least three big whale addresses made huge transfers, effectively activating the addresses after 10 years, in separate transactions. Such an address registered a transfer of 6,071 BTC after a long gap of 9.3 years. Similarly, two other whale addresses <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/whale_alert/status/1650456202432720899?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transferred</a> over 1,000 BTC separately, despite Bitcoin price maintaining sideways movement after consistent drop. In a latest, Whale Alert reported that:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A dormant address containing 1,000 BTC ($27,456,958) has just been activated after 12.0 years!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, several Ethereum (ETH) and XRP whale transactions were also registered around the same time.</p>

The most common outcome of this pattern is it triggers a significant downfall upon the breakdown of its support trendline. However, there are other criteria the traders must consider before entering the coin under the influence of this channel pattern.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In theory, the increasing gap between the channel’s trendline reflects the increasing indecisiveness and uncertainty among participants.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiple support level accumulated at $1 support indicates a higher possibility for an upcoming bullish reversal </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the MATIC is $318.5 Million, indicating a 15% loss.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/j/jyrS6o6X.png" alt="MATIC Price Prediction" width="1946" height="1104" />Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the recent sell-off in the crypto market, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/polygon/#:~:text=The%20live%20Polygon%20price%20today,in%20the%20last%2024%20hours.">MATIC price</a> has plunged back to the channel pattern’s support trendline. Moreover, along with the trendline at $1 psychological support, this level is also near the 50% Fibonacci retracement level and 100-day EMA slope.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These accumulated supports create a strong launchpad for coin buyers to sustain at a higher price. If buyers manage to hold above the rising trendline, the prices are likely to witness a bullish reversal and trigger a bull cycle within the pattern.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/new-upcoming-binance-listing/">15 New Cryptocurrencies In Upcoming Binance Listing For 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A possible target for this reversal could be the last swing high of $1.5, indicating a potential target of 50%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyhow the ongoing bullish rally will prolong until the pattern’s support trendline is intact, as a breakdown below it will invalidate the bullish thesis and signal the resumption of the prior downtrend.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicators</span></h2>
<p><b>Exponential Moving Average:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the recent downfall, the MATIC price dipped below the 20-and-50 <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMAs</a> after two months.</span></p>
<p><b>RSI: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The daily <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> nosedived below the midline indicating the rising negative sentiment among market participants.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">MATIC Coin Price Intraday Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $0.99</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend:  Bearish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Low</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance levels- $1.07 and $1.24</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support levels- $1 and $0.94</span></li>

Despite the fact that forecasts of sky-high valuations have been quite regular after previous rallies in Bitcoin&#8217;s price, there are a number of elements that are strongly motivating this particular prognosis, according to Standard Chartered&#8217;s head of digital assets research Geoff Kendrick. In November of 2020, a Citi analyst predicted that the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin">price of Bitcoin</a> may reach as high as $318,000 by the end of the year 2022. However, at $16,500, the flagship crypto asset was closed out for the year down roughly 65%. So the question is, will this too turn out to be another dud or finally come true?</p>
<h2>Bitcoin&#8217;s Bullish Factors</h2>
<p>The most recent crisis to hit the banking industry in the United States has lately sparked a price boom in Bitcoin and indirectly re-established its primary use case &#8220;as a decentralized, trustless, and scarce digital asset,&#8221; according to the bank. Additionally, Kendrick pointed out a number of other parameters which he thinks would fuel the price of Bitcoin which includes the fact that the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/federal-reserve-system/">Federal Reserve</a> would no longer be raising interest rates, the fact that the supply bitcoin would be halved again, and that regulatory benefits making into UK and USA would finally be realized.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: <a title="Do Kwon’s Latest Move Against U.S. SEC Could Be Game Changing, But Is It Enough?" href="https://coingape.com/do-kwo-latest-move-sec-game-changer/" rel="bookmark">Do Kwon’s Latest Move Against U.S. SEC Could Be Game Changing, But Is It Enough?</a></strong></em></p>
<p>According to Standard Chartered, the fact that the Federal Reserve of the United States is drawing closer to the conclusion of its cycle of interest rate hikes should be favorable for risk assets in general. Bitcoin, being the king of risk assets, tends to benefit from such a development. Moreover, its increasing connection to the Nasdaq stock market at the present time suggests that the leading cryptocurrency  should trade even better if risk assets were to improve more generally. However, Bitcoin&#8217;s ability to trade higher during bad periods for risk assets does not preclude it from doing so.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin&#8217;s Upcoming Halving</h2>
<p>The uniqueness of Bitcoin lies in its code. The coding behind the largest cryptocurrency by <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/market-capitalization/">market cap</a> is designed to ensure that the rate of supply expansion slows down over time. And it’s these in-built <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin-halving-2/">halving events</a> that have lent an impact on the price of Bitcoin previously. Because the source code is publicly available, simple calculations determine that the reward for a Bitcoin block is halved every 210,000 blocks, which is equivalent to around once in every four years.</p>
<p>When looking at historical information, we can see that the spot price of bitcoin has climbed by 1,263% between the 2016 and 2020 halvings.  If the current trends continue as they are, the price of bitcoin will reach $120,263 on the 23rd of March in 2024 which is in line with Kendrick&#8217;s Bitcoin price prediction.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-146123 size-full" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/25010308/S7xz2k0f_548d5ea6d7f39df10ce98d47614af67a569204f6af4e526df49d668bc8a95774.png" alt="Bitcoin price" width="1280" height="598" /></p>
<p>On Sunday , the price of Bitcoin dipped below $27,000 for a short period of time as the broader <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto market</a> continued its decline for five consecutive days. As things stand, Bitcoin’s price is currently exchanging hands at $27,348 which represents a drop of 0.43% over the past 24 hours in comparison to a loss of 7.47% recorded over the past seven days.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1200" height="800" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/01120714/Floki-Inu.jpg" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the Floki coin price witnessed a significant inflow and shows a 75% hike. This massive rise could be associated with the recent <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-news-support-for-floki-inu-meme-season-incoming/">listing announcement</a> of Floki in the California-based Binance exchange and also becoming the official partner of the Asian Badminton Championship 2023. This event could allow Floki to show its utility to numerous investors and present its brand in front of a massive crowd. Amid this rally, the coin price breached a crucial monthly resistance of $0.000042, offering an entry opportunity to potential buyers.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A daily candle closing at $0.000042 resistance will offer buyers a significant footing to prolong the bullish rally.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish breakout backed by tremendous high volume indicates the buyers’ conviction to achieve higher price levels</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the Floki coin is $116 Million, indicating a 903% gain.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past six weeks, the Floki coin price resonated in a fixed range spread from $0.000042 to $0.000027 level. In the daily time chart, this consolidation revealed the formation of a double bottom pattern. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pointing to this pattern’s core concept, the setup indicates strong sustainability for Floki&#8217;s price at $0.000027 base support which allows buyers to replenish bullish momentum. Moreover, the announcement of Floki to be an official partner of the Asian Badminton Championship 2023 has grabbed the attention of several investors fueling the ongoing intraday growth.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With today’s 75% price jump, the Floki price gave a decisive breakout from the $0.000042 neckline resistance of the double bottom pattern. Concerning the fast-moving price action, the new investors should form a candle closing above $0.000042 to confirm a breakout opportunity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the coming days, if the price shows sustainability above the breakout level, the buyers are likely to raise the coin’s market value 35% higher to hit $0.000057.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, the daily closing below $0.000042 may hint at the continuation of a sideways trend.</span></p>

This comes after the legal team representing Kwon alleged that the regulatory body lacked the legal jurisdiction to purse their lawsuit.</p>
<h2>Do Kwon&#8217;s Legal Tussle</h2>
<p>U.S. law enforcement accused Kwon of defrauding <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrency</a> investors in a 12-page indictment that was made public later last month. According to the lawsuit Kwon deceived &#8220;individuals about aspects of the Terra blockchain, including its technology and the extent to which it had been adopted by users.&#8221;</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: <a title="Ripple Moving Out Of U.S. After Coinbase CEO Drops Hint?" href="https://coingape.com/ripple-moving-out-of-u-s-after-coinbase-ceo-drops-hint/" rel="bookmark">Ripple Moving Out Of U.S. After Coinbase CEO Drops Hint?</a></strong></em></p>
<p>However, in response, Kwon&#8217;s attorneys <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66820843/29/securities-and-exchange-commission-v-terraform-labs-pte-ltd/" rel="nofollow">argued</a> that the SEC was unable to prove that it had personal jurisdiction over Kwon because the products referenced by the regulator were &#8220;available to the world and not directed at persons in the United States.&#8221; The allegations that have been hurled against them are categorically refuted throughout the 47-page report.</p>
<h2>Terra Calls UST A Currency</h2>
<p>In addition, the biggest ace in the hole is the <a href="https://coingape.com/terras-ust-peg-was-maintained-artificially-not-by-algorithm/">UST stablecoin</a>, which the Kwon legal team contends is a currency and not a security. As a result, the Kwon team concludes that the collapse of the Terra ecosystem falls outside of its jurisdiction. While the SEC argues that UST is a security because it could be used to buy LUNA, the Kwon team was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>The SEC has not previously asserted that something is a security merely because it can be used to buy something else the SEC calls a security.</p></blockquote>
<p>Although this has come as a shocker to the financial watchdog, it will still be an uphill task for Kwon&#8217;s lawyers to prove that UST is in fact a currency and not an unregistered crypto security as deemed by the regulators.</p>
<p>Kwon is still being investigated for criminal fraud by authorities in the United States, and in South Korea, as he&#8217;s currently accused of violating laws governing financial markets. Both nations have put forward requests to have the former executive extradited to their jurisdictions so that they can initiate rightful legal proceedings.</p>
<p>In the wake of this news, the price of LUNA gained by 3.11% in the past 1 hour in contrast to an increase of 2.07% recorded over the past 24 hours. It is currently exchanging hands at $1.38 at the time of writing.</p>

The proposal will not only abroad this new project, but enable other projects to build on the Terra Luna Classic blockchain.</p>
<p>Proposal 11477 “Increase MaxContractSize to upload code” submitted by TerraPoker to increase of key on Cosmos Wasm MaxContractSize to 819200 from 614400 is passed. This will allow the protocol to upload its contract on the chain and contribute to the LUNC burn campaign.</p>
<p>TerraPoker in a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/TP_TerraPoker/status/1650384169757999105" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">tweet</a> on April 24 appreciated the community for supporting the project to launch on the Terra Classic chain. The project will <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">provide the poker game with </span><span class="r-18u37iz">LUNC</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> soon and promises to burn 10% of the rake fees collected.</span></p>
<p>The adjustment in contract size will not only welcome Terra Poker into the Terra Classic ecosystem, but also allow other protocols to join and help developers build better solutions.</p>
<p>The proposal has received 60% of votes in favor, while 31% voted &#8220;No&#8221; and 8% voted &#8220;Abstain.&#8221; The current sentiment in the LUNC community suggests the proposal will increase utility on the chain and boost LUNC burn. Thus, major validators including Allnodes, LUNC DAO, TerraCVita, Interstake, and JESUSisLORD supported the project.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, validator <strong>Allnodes</strong> has <a href="https://coingape.com/lunc-news-allnodes-supports-terra-rebels-controversial-terra-classic-proposal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supported the controversial Proposal 11479</a> by the <strong>Terra Rebels</strong> developer group, passing the proposal to fund $37,593 worth of LUNC tokens for running Rebel Station Infrastructure for 3 months.</p>
<h2>Another Project on Terra Classic Burned 11.79 million LUNC</h2>
<p>While TerraPoker aims to burn millions of LUNC tokens, some projects such as Cremation Coin are already contributing large LUNC burns, with total net LUNC burn of over 344 million.</p>
<p>However, another project called <strong>GenesisX50</strong> has <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://finder.terra.money/classic/tx/AD3F617167E9A6289CB7CAF150132B613077B6633C4627599321A45C87EDF763" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">burned</a> <strong>11,799,000 LUNC</strong> in a single transaction. The project has now burned 13 million LUNC in total as part of its native GSX50 token burns.</p>
<p>Moreover, LUNC DAO has burned 1.44 LUNC tokens as part of the weekly burn plan. The validator has burned over 457 million LUNC in total.</p>

<h2>LUNC Price Remains Under Pressure</h2>
<p>South Korean District Court <a href="https://coingape.com/lunc-news-luna-is-not-a-security-declares-s-korean-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rejected the prosecutors&#8217; office claims</a> that Terra LUNA or Terra Classic LUNC are securities. Moreover, the court also dismissed the state’s appeal of confiscating Terraform Labs co-founder Daniel Shin.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to the Dubai-headquartered cryptocurrency exchange, KYC is a requirement for financial service providers that clients must fulfill.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Notably, the KYC process is in levels and the higher the level, the higher the offerings available to a user, especially for withdrawals.</span></p>
<h2><b>Enhanced Functionalities for Bybit Verified KYC Users</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Users who do not undergo the KYC process are limited to a withdrawal of about 20,000 Tether (USDT) or less daily. On the other hand, those who complete Lv.1, can access as much as 1 million USDT daily. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While the KYC Lv.2 users have a daily withdrawal limit of less than or equal to 2 million USDT. These withdrawal limits are basically for those on the non-VIP level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Therefore, those on the several VIP levels are entitled to higher daily withdrawal limits. It goes as high as 12 million USDT. As Bybit is seeing tremendous growth and in its <a href="https://coingape.com/bybit-launches-new-futures-contracts-to-expand-its-derivatives-offerings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">product offering</a>, so also is its need to become compliant in order to stay on the good side of the law.

<h2>Binance Lists Floki (FLOKI)</h2>
<p>On Monday, April 24, the California-based <a href="https://coingape.com/blog/binance-exchange-review/">Binance exchange</a> notified its millions of users about the upcoming Floki listing which would initially be paired with both USD and USDT support. The trading for the token is said to go live tomorrow, April 25, 2023 at 5 a.m. PDT / 8 a.m. EDT. However, according to the announcement, the deposit function for FLOKI tokens are currently enabled for users to fund their crypto accounts.</p>

<p>In the wake of this Binance news, the upcoming <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/meme-cryptocurrency/">meme cryptocurrency</a> &#8212; which is currently valued at $345 million &#8212; rose by nearly 6.1% in the past one hour while registering gains of roughly 25% in the past one hour. At the time of writing, the price of FLOKI is presently exchanging hands at $0.000035.</p>
<h2>Is A Meme Season Coming?</h2>
<p>As <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-adds-bitcoin-shiba-inu-dogecoin-stablecoins-to-liquid-swap/">reported</a> by CoinGape earlier today, Binance has created seven new liquidity pools for crypto including <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>, Shiba Inu, and <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/dogecoin">Dogecoin</a> in response to the growing demand for such cryptocurrencies. Moreover, emerging memecoins like Bone ShibaSwap (BONE), ArbDoge AI (AIDOGE) pumped more than 10% on news of a <a href="https://coingape.com/just-in-bone-shibaswap-bone-arbdoge-ai-aidoge-pump-10-on-okx-listing/">major exchange listing</a> today.</p>
<p>As a direct consequence of this, many in the crypto community are speculating of an impending memecoin rally where market participants anticipate higher retail engagement as an increasing number of exchanges provide support for these <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoins</a>. However, such price movements are heavily dependent on Bitcoin and a further decline from its current levels of $27K would turn out to be devastating for the larger <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/?utm_source=menubar">crypto market</a>.</p>

This famous trend reversal pattern is often spotted at the market bottom and offers early opportunities to go long. Amid the ongoing selling in the crypto market, the coin price is still shaping the third portion of the pattern, trying to sustain at higher chart levels. Here’s how this pattern may further influence the future trend of DOT prices.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Completion of the inverted head and shoulder pattern could drive the DOT price 80% higher than the current price</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A potential bearish crossover between the 20-and-50-day EMA may prolong the current correction phase</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 24-hour trading volume in the Polkadot coin is $165.5 Million, indicating a 49% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/d/DEkeRDD6.png" alt="Polkadot Price Prediction" width="1946" height="1104" />Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On April 18th, the Polkadot price turned down from the long-coming resistance trendline of an inverted head and shoulder and triggered a new correction phase. As a result, the coin price tumbled 16.9% to plunge to local support of $5.76-$5.66.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The negative sentiment in the market might have created this slight detour, but until the prices show sustainability above the $5.76 or $5.3 support, the bullish setup will remain intact. By the press time, the DOT price traded at the $5.9 mark but the lower price rejection candles observed in the last few days projects a higher possibility for price reversal.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/top-crypto-copy-trading-platforms/">Top Crypto Copy Trading Platforms For 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This potential reversal may push the price 12% higher to hit the aforementioned resistance trendline. Under the influence of this pattern, the buyers should eventually breach this dynamic resistance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an ideal bullish scenario, a breakout above the trendline may set the DOT price for an 80% rally to hit $10.8.</span></p>
<h2><b>Technical Analysis</b></h2>
<p><b>Bollinger Band:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the DOT price wavering at the lower band of the <a href="https://coingape.com/education/bollinger-band/">Bollinger band indicator</a> increases the possibility of a bullish reversal.</span></p>
<p><b>RSI:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The daily <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> took a sharp dive into the bearish territory indicating a negative sentiment in the market.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance levels- $6 and $6.6</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support levels- $5.6 and $5.3</span></li>

While the initiative is purely physical and involves improving road connectivity, the country&#8217;s digital infrastructure plans for cross border trade could change the face of international payments in the commercial space. This is because the initiative connects stakeholders from around 150 countries.</p>

<h2>Digital Yuan For China&#8217;s Belt And Road Initiative</h2>
<p>China&#8217;s logistics hubs just began promoting the digital Yuan (e-CNY) for usage in cross border trade, as per a report in the South China Morning Post. This could be huge as the Belt and Road initiative was in 2022 already covering 30% of the country&#8217;s import export global trade. Hence, this could be seen as potentially largest digital currency usage project so far globally. Earlier, CoinGape <a href="https://coingape.com/rbi-india-digital-rupee-launch-cities-cbdc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that India&#8217;s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), began implementing the digital rupee pilot for settlement of secondary market transactions.</p>
<p>Xuzhou, a well connected city in China&#8217;s Jiangsu, laid out a plan to promote the digital Yuan for trade purpose in 21 countries across Europe and Asia, besides taxes and utility services. The city&#8217;s authorities said the larger plan is to support the Belt and Road Initiative with e-CNY. Another city, Changshu, will pay government employees using digital Yuan.</p>
<p>However, this may not help the cause of <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto market</a> as the central bank digital currency (CBDC) projects operate outside the blockchain ecosystem. In fact, the CBDC market could potentially hamper cryptocurrency space both financially as well as in regulatory aspect.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1200" height="800" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/26113813/dogecoin1.jpg" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="dogecoin DOGE price crypto news" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" /><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://coingape.com/doge-price-prediction/">DOGE Price Prediction</a>: </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">April month has been a roller coaster ride for Dogecoin prices where it showed huge price swings but no commitment to a specific direction. Despite uncertain behavior, the coin price breached a long-coming resistance trendline on April 3rd offering an early sign for trend reversal. As of now, the buyers retest the breached trendline as a potential support to drive a sustained recovery rally.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A potential breakout above $0.08 will encourage the Dogecoin price to a 24% rally</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A breakdown below the support trendline will undermine the bullish thesis</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 24-hour trading volume in the Dogecoin coin is $1.16 Billion, indicating a 46% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/5/5WPLw5A0.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source-Tradingview </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the recent sell-off in the crypto market, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/dogecoin/">Dogecoin price</a> witnessed a 16.7% loss since last week&#8217;s high of $0.095 and plugged to the current market value of $0.079. As a result, the coin plummeted below the local support of $0.084-0.0793 but found immediate support at the aforementioned trendline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The daily chart showcasing lower price rejection candles at flipped trendline indicates buyers are obtaining strong support from this dynamic slope. On a contrary note, the recently breached $0.084 horizontal level may act as significant resistance causing the Dogecoin price to wobble in a narrow range.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/new-upcoming-binance-listing/">15 New Cryptocurrencies In Upcoming Binance Listing For 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If market sentiment improves and the DOGE price gives a daily candle closing above $0.084, the memecoin will get back on the recovery track. The potential breakout may lead the price to 24% higher to rechallenge the $0.1 psychological mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, a breakdown below the support trendline will encourage SHIB price for longer correction.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical indicators</span></h2>
<p><b>MACD: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The increasing gap between the falling <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a>(Blue) and signal(orange) line indicate aggressive selling pressure in the market.</span></p>
<p><b>EMAs: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">the daily <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMAs</a>(20, 50, 100, and 200) moving just above the coin price reflect the buyers will face multiple resistance in a recovery attempt.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dogecoin Price Intraday Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $0.079</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: High</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance levels- $0.08 and $0.085</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support levels- $0.071 and $0.0628</span></li>

Coinbase, the U.S. biggest <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/cryptocurrency-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto exchange</a>’s executive recently<a href="https://coingape.com/coinbase-ceo-meets-sec-amid-moving-offshore-reports/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> tipped off moving offshore</a>, however, several developments are hinting that Ripple Labs might also be considering leaving the U.S.</p>

<h2>Ripple Consider To Move Offshore?</h2>
<p>Ripple Labs and its executives are involved in the long running legal battle with the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/securities-and-exchange-commission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S SEC</a>. It is expected that a verdict in the XRP lawsuit will lead the crypto industry toward regulatory clarity around crypto assets. Meanwhile, <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://ripple.com/careers/all-jobs/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Ripple’s recent job postings</a> have left the crypto community confused.</p>
<p>As per Ripple’s Career posting page, the firm is offering around 66 roles in the firm. It is important to note that 46 postings are offered outside the United States. Meanwhile, 6 of the open roles offered in the U.S. are several kinds of internships. However, Ripple CEO Brad Galinghouse have earlier stated that they will move outside if they lose the legal battle against the SEC.</p>
<p>It is expected that the recent job posting might be a part of Ripple’s expansion as Garlinghouse and the team seems to be much more confident of winning the crucial XRP case after recent court verdicts.</p>

<p>U.S. watchdogs, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have recently picked up the pace by suing the crypto exchanges and lenders like Kraken, Bittrex and Gemini.</p>
<p>However, Brian Armstrong, Coinbase CEO is reportedly considering moving its head offices offshore. He stated that anything is on the table while in conversation with the ex UK Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne.</p>

<p>Traders immediately reacted to the recent announcement, causing Bone ShibaSwap (BONE) and AIDOGE prices to skyrocket by 10%.</p>
<h2>OKX Listing Bone ShibaSwap (BONE) and ArbDoge AI (AIDOGE)</h2>
<p>Crypto exchange OKX in a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/okx/status/1649376601971347456" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweet</a> on April 24 announced that the results of the special voting event for 5 meme token projects are out.

Users voted to list their favorite meme coin from ArbDoge AI (AIDOGE), BONE ShibaSwap (BONE), Bonk (BONK), Optimus AI (OPTI), and Pepe (PEPE).</p>
<p>The spot trading for BONE and AIDOGE will open tomorrow April 25 at 6:00 AM UTC. The crypto community reacted positively to the announcement by OKX. Other projects such as BONK, OPTI, and PEPE received few votes due to new projects and low trading volumes.</p>

<h2>Listed Meme Coins Rally</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/shibarium" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shibarium&#8217;s</a> gas token BONE rallied over 10% in a few hours, with the BONE price currently trading at $1.10. The 24-hour low and high are $1.008 and $1.115, respectively. Furthermore, the trading volume jumped over 50%, indicating an increase in interest among traders.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, ArbDoge AI (AIDOGE) is trading at $0.000000000312, up nearly 10% in the last 24 hours. The 24-hour low and high are $0.000000000268 and $0.000000000332, respectively. ArbDoge AI is not a project but an experiment in the Arbitrum ecosystem. Thus, investors should be cautious as trading in such crypto assets involves significant risk and may incur partial or full loss of invested capital.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/0/0jtZjOJU.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the weekly time frame chart, the Binance coin price shows the formation of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/symmetrical-triangle-pattern/">symmetrical triangle pattern.</a> Under the influence of this pattern, the asset price resonated between two converging trendlines showcasing a steady sideways trend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The coin price coiling narrow within the triangle is bound to break either of the given trendlines and trigger a direction rally. As of now, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/binance-coin/">BNB price</a> trades at $329.8 with an intraday loss of 0.27%. Amid the recent sell-off in the market, the coin price turned down from the overhead resistance trendline is likely to hit the lower one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until the lower trendline is intact, the BNB holders are safe from a massive downfall, however, a breakout above the resistance trendline is needed to start a new recovery rally.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solana </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(SOL)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/a/ApKR2Bw3.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On April 11th, the<a href="https://coingape.com/price/solana/"> Solana coin price</a> gave a massive breakout from a long-coming resistance trendline. After facing intense selling pressure at this dynamic resistance a breakout above was a sign of trend reversal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, with the increasing <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fud/">FUD</a> in the market, the Solana price shows a minor pullback and retests the breached trendline as potential support. If the coin price shows sustainability above the trendline, it would mean the market sentiment shifted from selling on rallies to buying in dips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the post-retest rally may drive the SOL price to a high of $37.75 mark.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Polkadot (DOT)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/k/kuffXP4J.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the weekly time frame chart, the Polkadot coin shows one of the famous trend reversal patterns called inverted head and shoulder. This pattern consists of a long swing low called the head and two minor swing longs called the shoulders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/polkadot/">DOT price</a> trades at $5.95 and shapes the right shoulder pattern of the pattern. Despite the rising selling pressure in the market, if the coin price manages to sustain above local support of $5.7, this pattern will encourage the altcoin to breach the overhead neckline resistance at $6.5</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In ideal bullish conditions, a breakout of the resistance trendline may drive the DOT price to a high of $10.8</span></p>

The <span class="css-1f5vusx">Binance Liquid Swap</span> allows users to either swap between different tokens or provide liquidity to Binance’s pools to earn rewards.</p>
<h2>Binance Launches Bitcoin, Shiba Inu, Dogecoin Liquidity Pools</h2>
<p>Crypto exchange Binance&#8217;s Liquid Swap service on April 24 <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-liquid-swap-adds-bel-usdt-btc-tusd-id-btc-id-usdt-shib-doge-syn-usdt-tusd-usdt-liquidity-pools-5fab5d8429464211a4fab3c188a37a28" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it has added seven new liquidity pools. The popular liquidity pools are BTC/TUSD, SHIB/DOGE, and TUSD/USDT. Others include BEL/USDT, ID/BTC, ID/USDT, and SYN/USDT.</p>
<p>While the liquidity pools allow users to trade instantly and pool tokens to earn rewards, adding liquidity into a liquid pool and becoming a liquidity provider is not risk-free. The market price of tokens can greatly fluctuate during volatile market conditions, causing the staking income to remain lower or incur losses.</p>
<p>Binance has recently <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-listing-multiple-crypto-with-tusd-linked-justin-sun/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inclined towards TrueUSD (TUSD) stablecoin</a> after Paxos stopped issuing Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin as a result of the U.S. regulatory crackdown against crypto. In fact, the <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-ends-zero-free-bitcoin-trading-after-btc-price-26k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto exchange removed zero-fee trading</a> for all crypto pairs except TUSD. This caused a <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-bitcoin-derivatives-trading-volume-declining-after-cftc-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">massive decline in BTC trading volumes</a> across several pairs and BTC/TUSD trading volume has increased marginally.</p>
<p>SHIB/DOGE liquidity pool allows users to swap tokens at market price. Both meme coins have witnessed increasing demand after the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/shibarium" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shibarium</a> Layer-2 blockchain beta release and <a href="https://coingape.com/just-in-elon-musk-declaring-new-ceo-pumps-dogecoin-floki-inu-shiba-inu-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elon Musk hinting at Dogecoin</a> integration into Twitter for payments.</p>
<p>Notably, a transaction fee will be charged when adding only one crypto asset to the liquidity pool.</p>

<h2>Crypto Prices Remain Under Pressure</h2>
<p>Crypto traders immediately respond to the latest announcement by Binance. Top crypto including Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu witnessed a marginal increase in prices.</p>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC price</a> remains under pressure and trading below $27,500, with a low of $27,169. The price is currently bouncing from the $27k level amid some buying by investors at the dip.</p>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/price/shiba-inu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SHIB price</a> currently trades at $0.0000103, down 11% in a week due to selloffs and low burn rate in the last few days. The community expects SHIB price to end the year at $0.01.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://coingape.com/price/dogecoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOGE price</a> also remains under pressure. The price currently trades at $0.0791, down 2% in the last 24 hours and 17% in a week. However, some believe this could be the last time a correction is witnessed before crypto prices recover.</p>
