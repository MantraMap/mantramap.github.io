<ul>
<li>Bitcoin supply has dropped over 10% across the United States in the last two years as adoption grows in other jurisdictions. </li>



<li>The Asian market remains the most significant gainer since 2021, with slightly over 11%, while Europe recorded modest growth. </li>



<li>Analysts point fingers at the growing uncertainty in United States digital asset regulation as a major factor in the decline.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Often warned by industry executives, the United States is losing its grip on digital assets more significantly in Bitcoin (BTC) although a much safer investor atmosphere could cause a turnaround.</p>



<p>New <a href="https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1666784344868806657?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">data</a> from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode show that the 2022 bear market affected the United States market more than other jurisdictions in terms of growth and adoption. Since mid-2022 the amount of Bitcoin traded by US firms has dropped by 11%, with most tricking into Asia.</p>



<p>“<em>A clear divergence is visible in the year-over-year BTC supply change based on geographical regions. The extreme dominance of US entities in 2020-21 has clearly reversed, with US supply dominance falling by 11% since mid-2022,” </em>Glassnode researchers noted.</p>



<p>The Asian market recorded a 9.9% increase throughout 2022 but still lags behind US high levels of Jan 2021. European markets have maintained their position recording a slight increase of 1.1% in BTC supply dominance.</p>



<p>“<em>European markets have been fairly neutral over the last year, whilst a significant increase in supply dominance is visible across Asian trading hours.”</em></p>



<p>Europe has become an attractive spot in driving crypto investments after it began drafting the Markets In Crypto Asset (MiCA) regulation. The regulation seeks to unify cryptocurrency regulation across the jurisdiction and clear uncertainty amongst other things in the region. Many commentators have tipped MiCA to be the “<em>turning point” </em>in crypto regulation and positioned Europe at the center of digital asset adoption.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-asia-steals-the-show"><strong>Asia steals the show</strong></h2>



<p>Several US crypto executives have berated the state of things in the sector following the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) enforcement-by-regulation approach. This year, Republican lawmakers also blasted the Commission’s Chairman Gary Gensler for his hostile stance against digital assets.</p>



<p>At a hearing in the House Financial Service Committee in April, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/gary-gensler-is-driving-crypto-to-china-republican-congressman-hit-sec-chair-with-fresh-allegations/">lawmakers</a> grilled Gensler for the lack of clarity in the sector with Rep Tom Emmer accusing him of driving investments to China. “<em>You’re pushing start-ups into the hands of the Chinese Communist Party,” </em>she said.</p>



<p>China is reportedly making plans to reconsider its harsh stance on digital assets as Hong Kong has allowed exchanges to offer trading services and is playing down plans for a state-owned exchange. The renewed push among exchanges for the Asian market also points to a larger interest in web3 and Bitcoin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Uniswap’s new upgrade has sparked a new controversy regarding its “open source” description, with developers saying “<em>it is not as advertised.”</em></li>



<li>The company released its fourth version on a Business Source License, giving room for critics due to its four-year open-source period.</li>



<li>Uniswap has responded to critics explaining that four years is not a long time to balance incentivizing innovation and giving out exclusive rights.</li>
</ul>



<p>This week, Uniswap’s developers noted that the new version of the decentralized exchange (DEX) will offer users limitless possibilities; while that may be true, some promises were not.</p>



<p>Prior to the launch of Uniswap’s V4, the management team made several promises from the increased utility of the exchange to its open-source nature which attracted the attention of developers. The promise of it being open-source has been called a “<em>misrepresentation” </em>by a cross-section of Ethereum’s community.</p>



<p>The V4 was released as a Business Source License (BSL), which means that its code is open to the public and can be copied, reproduced, and redistributed, but there’s a caveat. All these can only be done after four years when it converts to a General Purpose License (GPL).</p>



<p>Lefteris Karapetsas, an Ethereum developer and founder of Rotki, expressed his displeasure stating that “Uniswap decided to go with a Business Source License (BSL), continuing what they did with v3. The reason is they don’t understand open source,<em> and they believe their moat is their code which is wrong.” </em>He was the first to call out Uniswap on Twitter and urged them to use the proper terminology as this “<em>is insulting to actual open-source software.”</em></p>



<p>Another dev, Scott Lewis, <a href="https://twitter.com/scott_lew_is/status/1668740924489232384?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">pointed</a> out that Unisawap’s V4 is a four-year proprietary license adding that “<em>If anyone else misrepresented the truth like this, they would be torn to shreds. That’s the power of being powerful.”</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-uniswap-defend-their-false-claims"><strong>Uniswap defend their “<em>false” </em>claims</strong></h2>



<p>Hayden Adams the founder of Uniswap alongside his development team addressed the controversy on YouTube. The group noted that the four-year period is not as long time as it appears, and it strikes a healthy balance between “<em>incentivizing innovation and giving exclusive rights to the protocol, which has precedents in &#8216;normal&#8217; settings as well.”</em></p>



<p>Gabriel Shapiro describes it as a tax on innovation, explaining further that it would be difficult for young devs to navigate while building from scratch. </p>



<p>“<em>Anyone who&#8217;s looked at BSL code even once, and then later codes something similar, is at a risk of catching a copyright claim,” </em>he added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the criticisms meted out against Uniswap, many have hailed the V4 for rolling out a new smart contract termed “<em>hooks” </em>which lets developers expand liquidity pools increasing customizability.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Former SEC Director Says Judgment On Ripple vs SEC Lawsuit To Come Within Days — XRP Price To $10?</p>



<p>$1 XRP Price Looks Nigh</p>



<p>A long-time enforcement attorney-cum-regional director at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has predicted that Ripple’s long-standing tussle with the agency will conclude in days’ time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-the-end-near"><strong>Is The End Near?</strong></h2>



<p>The SEC-Ripple case, which has dragged on for over two years now, may be coming to an end very soon.</p>



<p>Marc Fagel, the former Regional Director of the SEC’s San Francisco Regional Office, <a href="https://twitter.com/Marc_Fagel/status/1669390377168805890">expects </a>a judge to issue her ruling in the XRP lawsuit in the coming days. Fagel was responding to an XRP enthusiast who suggested in a tweet that the SEC withdrawing its lawsuits before summary judgment potentially undermines the presiding judge. A follow-up tweet noted that a delay in the verdict would bolster the argument that public relations influenced the judge’s decision and that it would lead to more confusion.</p>



<p>While trying to avoid speculation, Fagel posited that a court decision could be expected within days. In his opinion, any further delay in the lawsuit would be due to the complexities of the case and not any hidden agendas.</p>



<p>The SEC <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">initiated </a>its precedent-setting suit against Ripple, CEO Brad Garlinghouse, and chairman Chris Larsen in the last quarter of 2020. The allegation: raising north of $1.2 billion from 2013 via the unlicensed sale of alleged security, XRP.</p>



<p>The XRP community was recently in uproar after the infamous William Hinman materials were <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-primed-for-massive-upsurge-as-sec-case-tilts-in-ripples-favor-amid-huge-reveal-of-hinman-docs/">released to the public</a>. Ripple’s counsel argued that Hinman’s speech in 2018 — where he reportedly said that Ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, was not a security — fostered confusion, leading market participants, including Ripple, to believe that XRP was not a security.</p>



<p>According to former SEC director Fagel, Ripple’s case is quite different from other enforcement actions recently launched by the securities watchdog. He opined that the judge would likely not address the Hinman documents or the secondary market trading matter. The emails, however, may be referenced in connection with a verdict on the individual defendants&#8217; liability.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Implications Of The Impending Ruling</strong></h2>



<p>Weighing in on the Twitter conversation, XRP holders’ attorney John Deaton recalled his earlier argument that the greatest mistake in the suit was charging individual execs with aiding and abetting, sparking a recklessness standard. Nevertheless, Deaton is confident that no reasonable jury can find the two Ripple executives reckless.</p>



<p>The high-stakes drama between the SEC and Ripple is likely to be the defining moment for the broader crypto industry, not just for XRP.  SEC chair Gary Gensler has frequently reiterated his belief that all cryptocurrencies — except for Bitcoin — are securities, signalling the Commission’s intent to scrutinize more crypto assets.</p>



<p>A Ripple defeat would hamper mainstream adoption, embolden the SEC to pursue similar cases, cause market turbulence, and an exodus of many ambitious crypto startups looking for friendlier jurisdictions away from the United States. Notably, Deaton, earlier this month <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-lawsuit-sec-has-a-3-chance-of-winning-says-lawyer-predicts-xrp-victory-surge-to-10-price/">predicted </a>a 3% chance of District Judge Analisa Torres ruling in favor of the SEC.</p>



<p>A Ripple victory, on the other hand, would boost confidence in crypto assets and usher in a new era of investments. If this happens, the price of Ripple’s XRP could rocket to as high as $10 in no time, per Deaton.</p>

<p>Intercontinental Exchange-owned Bakkt has delisted Solana, Polygon, and Cardano, adding to a growing list of crypto firms ending support for the tokens amid a wave of regulatory uncertainty in the United States.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bakkt-shakes-up-crypto-offerings-delists-ada-matic-sol"><strong>Bakkt Shakes Up Crypto Offerings, Delists ADA, MATIC, SOL</strong></h2>



<p>Regulatory pressures have led New York-based digital assets platform Bakkt to delist native tokens for prominent blockchains Solana, Polygon, and Cardano.</p>



<p>Bakkt’s general counsel and secretary Marc D&#8217;Annunzio <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/06/16/bakkt-delists-solana-polygon-cardano-regulatory-clarity/">told </a><em>Fortune </em>the firm was implementing changes “until there is further clarity on how to compliantly offer a more extensive list of coins.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The exchange Bakkt delisted ADA, MATIC, and SOL on the grounds of unclear supervision.  Bakkt delisted Algorand and Decentraland tokens amid the SEC lawsuit against Bittrex, and then voluntarily delisted 25 tokens in May.  Bakkt currently offers eight tokens including BTC, ETH,…</p>&mdash; Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1669684096526860289?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 16, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The delisting move comes after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed two lawsuits last week against cryptocurrency exchanges <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-suffers-double-whammy-as-sec-and-state-regulators-act-against-exchange-for-unregistered-securities/">Coinbase </a>and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">Binance</a>. The regulator alleged that SOL, MATIC, ADA, and other digital assets were unregistered securities in both filings.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Robinhood Started The Trend</strong></h2>



<p>Bakkt is at least the third company in recent days to axe tokens labelled as unregistered securities by the SEC. Popular trading app Robinhood <a href="https://zycrypto.com/robinhood-ceases-support-for-cardano-solana-and-polygon-after-sec-calls-them-securities/">cut support </a>for ADA, MATIC, and SOL on June 9. eToro followed suit on June 12, <a href="https://twitter.com/eToroUS/status/1668323758199955456">suspending </a>trading of Decentraland, Dash, Algorand, and Polygon for U.S. customers in light of the SEC’s recent legal action. This is not the first time eToro is delisting tokens in response to SEC-related pressure. In late 2020, the platform halted access to XRP shortly after the SEC <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">sued </a>Ripple. </p>



<p>That being said, Bakkt does not seem to be popular enough to impact investor sentiments or the market. The prices of ADA, SOL, and MATIC are up by 1.8%, 3.7%, and 1.1%, respectively, despite the company’s decision. </p>



<p>Still, Bakkt&#8217;s decision to halt support for major altcoins may influence other companies to follow suit.</p>

<p>The prospective entry of investment management firm <a href="https://zycrypto.com/blackrocks-new-bitcoin-trust-could-be-the-catalyst-for-central-banks-investing-in-btc-dcgs-barry-silbert/">BlackRock</a> into Crypto has fed market curiosity and enthusiasm. According to a report by Reuters, BlackRock intends to introduce a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) and has chosen Coinbase, a well-known cryptocurrency exchange, to serve as the digital asset&#8217;s custodian. The announcement has shocked the cryptocurrency market, boosting expectations and igniting debates about the potential effects of such a move.</p>



<p>The rumours about BlackRock&#8217;s Bitcoin ETF have led to a wave of speculative activity among investors and industry insiders. Even though the ETF&#8217;s specifics haven&#8217;t been confirmed, the news has sparked much interest and anticipation in the cryptocurrency industry. BlackRock&#8217;s entry into the market would be a significant turning point for cryptocurrencies, further establishing Bitcoin as a respectable asset class for investors.</p>



<p>According to Reuters, BlackRock has submitted a preliminary prospectus to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a spot Bitcoin ETF. As per the application, the ETF will make direct investments in Bitcoin rather than through futures contracts. Because Coinbase is a reputable and well-known company in the Crypto market, using them as the custodian for the coin lends credibility to the offering.</p>



<p>BlackRock&#8217;s engagement may draw institutional investors and open the door for a wider acceptance of cryptocurrencies, given that it already manages over $9 trillion in assets. Due to the ETF&#8217;s design and affiliation with a respectable financial company like BlackRock, traditional investors may be able to access Bitcoin through a controlled and regulated channel.</p>



<p>On the other hand, BlackRock&#8217;s application for a spot Bitcoin ETF might be an instance of perception distorting reality. Current difficulties and legal barriers that earlier proposals for similar ETFs have encountered are still very much present. Even though the filing is a big accomplishment in and of itself, the SEC&#8217;s approval of the ETF is by no means guaranteed. Due to market manipulation and investor protection worries, previous applications for <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-ruins-christmas-for-cryptocurrency-investors-with-yet-another-bitcoin-spot-etf-rejection/">Bitcoin ETFs were rejected</a>.</p>



<p>Investors are keenly following proceedings and anxiously expecting the SEC&#8217;s judgment due to the news from BlackRock, which has sparked a buzz in the cryptocurrency market. A BlackRock Bitcoin ETF, if approved, could draw large institutional capital inflows, possibly promoting broader development and general acceptance of cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>The prospective introduction of a Bitcoin ETF by BlackRock represents a significant step towards bridging the divide between traditional finance and the realm of digital assets as the Crypto market develops. If successful, this approach might significantly influence the course of cryptocurrencies and their absorption into the world financial system.</p>

<p>In a June 9, 2023 post on his website, Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin outlined the three major technical transitions that the Ethereum protocol must undergo to offer an open, global, and permissionless experience to the average user.</p>



<p>According to Buterin, the three simultaneous transitions for Ethereum are; the Layer 2 (L2) scaling transition, the wallet security transition, and the privacy transition. Buterin says that intense coordination requiring deep changes from applications and wallets is required to achieve these transitions.</p>



<p>Buterin points out that smart contract wallets make the keeping of one address more difficult since some L2 blockchains are not compatible with Ethereum Virtual Machines (EVM), yet privacy may require each user to have even more addresses. The EVM is software that executes smart contracts and updates Ethereum Network after a new block is added to the chain.</p>



<p>Buterin says that since many users&#8217; funds are stored in the same smart contract and hence at the same address, apps that rely on the assumption that address ownership is immutable will have to find alternative ways to achieve this goal.</p>



<p>For key recovery, Buterin proposes that instead of running the recovery procedure on each address separately, the wallet can include software to execute the recovery procedure across all of a user&#8217;s addresses at the same time.</p>



<p>However, considerations still need to be made on gas cost implications and privacy concerns over publicly linking all addresses by recovering them at the same time and hence proposes the use of an architecture that separates verification logic and asset holdings.</p>



<p>Buterin says that overcoming the above challenges requires lots of secondary infrastructure to be updated and wallets interacting with spending and encryption keys will have to be improved.</p>



<p>Buterin gives an example of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) that makes it a lot easier for regular users to minimize the possibility of using a wrong wallet address mistake considerably but is expensive. To enhance its use, Buterin says that ENS subdomains are now automatically verifiable on L2 blockchains.</p>



<p>Buterin says that although wallets are essential for securing assets, they also hold user data. Holding a single encryption key could resolve the protection of user data, however losing your encryption key, still results in loss of assets.</p>



<p>However, to avoid users having multiple recovery paths, Buterin proposes that wallets will likely need to manage both the recovery of assets and encryption keys.</p>



<p>Buterin further proposes that any chosen design should maintain decentralization while at the same time offering easy access to users’ assets using open and not proprietary solutions.</p>



<p>Buterin says that achieving the three technical transitions is crucial and Ethereum must rise to the challenge for improved user experience and to attain a sustainable future.</p>

<p>The last two weeks have been tough for the crypto industry in the US as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has sued Binance and Coinbase in a wave of regulatory crackdown.</p>



<p>This ripple effect affects other countries as local regulators started to take a tough stand against crypto. As a result, strategists say the industry may bow to pressure, and crypto exchanges will be registered with the SEC as the commission has always wanted.</p>



<p>However, the CEO of Blockstream, Adam Back, says the industry will survive the regulatory pressure mounted on it, and at the BTC Prague conference, Back expressed confidence that the crypto industry’s adaptability will enable it to come out of these trying times.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;The system is antifragile,&#8221; </em>Back said<em>. &#8220;Something is a problem? They&#8217;ll do something else or create an economic incentive for somebody. Some other company that had a different strategy will get a large amount of users,” </em>he added.</p>



<p>One reason he’s so confident is that the industry is driven by user demand, which is increasing. As a result, users will always find alternatives even if crypto exchanges close down in their locations.</p>



<p>The industry has always faced regulatory pressure, but not of this magnitude. Since Gary Gensler became the chairman of the SEC, the commission has gone all out to regulate the crypto industry, despite a lack of regulatory clarity.</p>



<p>Crypto exchanges worldwide are making changes to ensure compliance with the commission&#8217;s guidelines, including delisting some trading pairs of cryptocurrencies recently tagged as securities.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, crypto influencers and lobbyists have warned the commission not to overstep its boundaries in trying to enforce regulations in the industry. Several crypto establishments have expressed their opinions on the matter.</p>



<p>Hopefully, the process will lead to proper regulation by the legislature to give the industry clear guidance and direction to follow to ensure there are no breaches and that the industry thrives in the country.</p>

<p>On June 14, 2023, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the Federal Reserve (Fed) maintained interest rates at the 5-5.25% target range after ten consecutive rate hikes. The Fed said it would assess additional information and its implications for monetary policy. </p>



<p>According to the FOMC, although recent indicators suggested that economic activity continued to expand at a modest pace with robust job gains and a low unemployment rate, inflation remained elevated.</p>



<p>The FOMC said that it would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and is prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee&#8217;s goals of achieving maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2% over the longer run.</p>



<p>According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the May U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.1% in May 2023 after increasing 0.4% in April. Over the last 12 months, the all-items index increased by 4.0% before seasonal adjustment. Shelter and used cars and trucks contributed the most to the monthly increases.</p>



<p>In a June 15, 2023 press release, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) raised the three key ECB interest rates by 0.25%, effective June 21, 2023. The interest rate on the main refinancing operations, the marginal lending facility, and the deposit facility will increase to 4.00%, 4.25%, and 3.50%, respectively.</p>



<p>The ECB noted that though inflation has been coming down, it is projected to remain too high for long. In the press conference following the ECB&#8217;s interest rate decision, Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, said that energy, food, and the war in Ukraine all posed upside risks to inflation.</p>



<p>Lagarde further said that though energy and food price inflation had trended lower in May 2023, past increases in energy costs were pushing up prices across the economy. According to the ECB&#8217;s Governing Council, future interest rate decisions will return inflation to the 2% medium-term target.</p>



<p>Shortly after the US Fed’s interest rate announcement, Bitcoin and Ether traded below US$25k and US$1,700, respectively. Most other major altcoins also witnessed price declines following the Fed interest rate announcement. </p>



<p>Analysts have attributed the fall in crypto prices to the possibility of further Fed interest rate hikes later in the year. The next FOMC meeting is scheduled for July 25-26, 2023.</p>



<p>Following the ECB&#8217;s interest rate announcement, crypto prices have remained at relatively the same levels over the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>Prevalent blockchain platform <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-solana-polygon-prices-make-comeback-rally-as-foundations-fire-back-against-secs-security-label/">Cardano (ADA)</a> has generated a lot of curiosity as analysts have great hopes for its price performance by the end of 2023. Experts forecast significant milestones and tremendous upside potential for ADA, citing the platform&#8217;s solid foundations and expanding ecosystem. However, investors&#8217; worries over recent price swings have sparked discussions over what causes the market volatility for ADA.</p>



<p>Sebastian Purcell, CEO of 1.2 Capital Management, predicts that Cardano prices will rise since the recent drop in ADA&#8217;s price caused by SEC-related worries has abated and it is likely that concerned investors have liquidated their holdings. The analyst predicts that the Ripple case&#8217;s verdict will substantially impact the price of ADA. If Ripple wins, ADA might increase to a low $.50 range. Even during a future bull market, ADA might find achieving its prior all-time high challenging if the result is unfavourable. He emphasized the importance of monitoring the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/how-the-outcome-of-sec-v-ripple-case-could-shape-crypto-markets-as-xrp-army-eagerly-awaits-verdict/">Ripple case</a> since it may affect ADA performance.</p>



<p>Other analysts have different estimates ranging from $5 to $10, demonstrating the consensus among analysts that ADA will rise. These projections are based on Cardano&#8217;s growth in terms of user base, interoperability, and functionality. Due to its innovative approach to decentralized finance, Cardano is heralded as a possible game-changer in the crypto space.</p>



<p>Parallel to this, important Cardano metrics have sharply increased, indicating a bullish market. According to data from analytics firm Santiment, the number of active addresses, the volume of transactions, and social media involvement have increased yearly. This increase in important metrics shows how the Cardano ecosystem is generating more interest and engagement. User involvement and participation have increased due to the platform&#8217;s developments in decentralized applications (dApps) and emphasis on sustainability and scalability.</p>



<p>However, recent market changes have made Cardano&#8217;s price performance uncertain. According to CoinMarketCap, ADA experienced a significant 20% price decline in the last seven days, which alarmed holders. The drop prompted discussions regarding the likely causes of the fall. Some theorize that profit-taking and the general market mood have impacted the decrease in ADA&#8217;s price. Understanding that the choppy crypto market frequently experiences price changes and that a brief decline does not necessarily rule out Cardano&#8217;s long-term potential is essential.</p>



<p>While analysts continue to be upbeat about Cardano&#8217;s future development, investors must carefully weigh both advantages and disadvantages when assessing the long-term potential of ADA.</p>



<p>The uptick in key measures and the bullish price forecasts for 2023 are signs of rising engagement in the Cardano ecosystem. However, recent price swings serve as a reminder of the Crypto market&#8217;s inherent volatility. Crypto adherents will follow <a href="https://zycrypto.com/charles-hoskinson-reveals-exciting-vision-for-cardano-ada-this-summer/">Cardano&#8217;s development</a> as it strengthens its position and keeps innovating, and they will base their judgments on a thorough evaluation of the platform&#8217;s potential.</p>

<li>Block’s self-custody Bitcoin wallet, Bitkey, will integrate Coinbase and CashApp, making it seamless for users to trade their assets. </li>



<li>The company also plans to partner with Coinbase One to enable users to convert their assets to fiat later this year.</li>



<li>Jack Dorsey’s Bitcoin investments, from mining to self-custody, have been hailed as a shining light to be emulated by other BTC executives.</li>
</ul>



<p>The general public will be able to take part in the beta test of Bitkey in a few weeks according to Block, its parent company striking the excitement of users.</p>



<p>Jack Dorsey’s payment company Block has announced a special integration of CashApp and leading US digital asset exchange Coinbase on its self-custody wallet, Bitkey. This new feature will let users withdraw from their wallets in both Coinbase and CashApp directly from Bitkey. </p>



<p>The company noted that an open beta program will be available to the general public rather than former ones which were restricted to its staff. According to the announcement, users can test the hardware device alongside other software for free, a move that spiked its value by 4%.</p>



<p>“<em>You’ll be asked to try out the product with your bitcoin, and share your feedback with us via interviews and surveys, which will help us shape the product. You’ll get to keep your free Bitkey hardware device to continue using with future versions of the app,” </em>the announcement reads.</p>



<p>The hardware wallet would include both PIN code and biometric authentication for added safety. The company will also incorporate third-party exchanges to allow users to purchase Bitcoin through integrated apps. Bitkey explained that its recent partnerships are part of its effort to become empower 100 million users while driving up adoption.</p>



<p>“<em>Back in March, we explained how partners can contribute to Bitkey’s mission to empower the next 100 million people to truly own and manage their money with Bitcoin,” the blog post states. “These partnerships represent a key step towards helping customers have more control and ownership over their financial lives with Bitcoin self-custody.” </em>the company stated.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jack-dorsey-still-has-more-to-offer"><strong>Jack Dorsey still has more to offer</strong></h2>



<p>Jack Dorsey has remained bullish on Bitcoin over other digital assets over the years with contributions in payment solutions, mining, and hardware wallets. Dorsey pledged $5 million to Bitcoin developers this month through his relief fund Start Small.</p>



<p>Last year, the tech CEO also made rounds with his huge investment in renewable energy Bitcoin mines amid criticisms on the impact of Proof-of-work assets on the environment. Dorsey also unveiled plans for a high-end mining kit as well as a nano BTC mining chip. This year will come with the Bitkey wallet alongside several innovations.</p>



<p>Coinbase <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/announcing-a-global-partnership-with-blocks-bitkey-wallet">announced</a> that its partnership with Bitkey would include a “<em>joint offer” </em>with Coinbase which rolls out this year allowing users to convert their assets to fiat. Bitkey is expected to be launched later this year across many jurisdictions including the United States, UK, Brazil, Australia, etc.</p>

<ul>
<li>An ancient Bitcoin investor has made a whopping $1.2 million after moving dormant assets for the first time in 13 years.</li>



<li>Experts share their opinions on IT geeks and a few institutional investors who bought assets in the Satoshi era.</li>



<li>The falling price of BTC to its three-month low could be seen as a factor that occasioned the sale.</li>
</ul>



<p>This year has marked the resurrection of several Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoin whales due to gains recorded in the market after the turmoil of 2022, which saw most assets lose nearly 50% of their value.</p>



<p>A Bitcoin whale has sold 50 BTC, acquired in 2010 after 13 years of inactivity, making $1.2 million at present prices. According to blockchain data, the wallet <a href="https://explorer.btc.com/btc/address/13CFnFFn932HdxjP2sJYdijmcDPVvDVT2i">address</a> <em>13CFnFFn932HdxjP2sJYdijmcDPVvDVT2i</em> received the coins in June 2010, leaving many digital asset enthusiasts wondering why the decision was made to transfer the assets 13 years later in June.</p>



<p>Bitcoin whales are large-scale investors who are known for this hoarding behaviour as they mostly sell a significant portion of their stash after many years. As a result of their deep pockets, the activities of bigger whales can swing the direction of the markets, unlike small-scale retail investors.</p>



<p>It is still unclear if this whale was a corporate investor or an IT geek, as computer geeks dominated the BTC market at that time. A developer Kirill Kretov noted that it is quite possible for “<em>IT Geeks” </em>to hold the stash but added that “<em>some commercial entity acquired those wallets from individuals in some later years, preserving the status of those addresses in blockchain.”</em></p>



<p>The price of BTC is at $25,550, recovering from its recent slump below $25,000 for the first time in three months after the Feds hinted that there might be more interest rate hikes in the future.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-trend-continues-amid-shaky-prices"><strong>The trend continues amid shaky prices</strong></h2>



<p>This year has seen many old BTC <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ancient-bitcoin-wallet-comes-back-to-life-after-12-years-owner-rakes-millions-in-profits/">stashes</a> return into circulation after many years of inactivity. In April, two huge transactions were recorded as a 10-year-old stash was moved for about $7.8 million, and just days after, $11 million worth of assets were transferred. </p>



<p>In Sep 2021, a whopping $30 million in assets was moved after it was acquired for $8,195 nine years ago. Although the resurrection isn’t peculiar to this year, a growing number has come in recent months. The reason cited is the market recovery so far wiping off losses of 2022. Last year, BTC plummeted over 55%, touching new lows not posted in months.</p>



<p>Observers say the surge in the market has led to whales looking to pick up profits after years of hodling while others suggest that recent regulatory crises are another factor.</p>

<p>The decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, Sturdy Finance, lost 442 ETH (approximately $765,000 at the time of this publication) due to a security vulnerability exploited by some hackers.</p>



<p>The blockchain security company, <a href="https://twitter.com/peckshield/status/1668067645638299648">PeckShield</a>, alerted the DeFi protocol on Twitter about fraudulent transactions through which attackers manipulated prices on the platform.</p>



<p>&#8220;We are aware of the reported exploit of the Sturdy protocol. All markets have been paused; no additional funds are at risk, and no user actions are required at this time,&#8221; affirmed Sturdy Finance.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sturdy-finance-loses-765-000-in-eth"><strong>Sturdy Finance loses $765,000 in ETH</strong></h2>



<p>The DeFi platform confirmed that it was a victim of the attack and sent a message to its users, assuring them that the necessary measures have been taken to prevent further funds from being stolen from the protocol.</p>



<p>However, the hacker managed to steal over $765,000 in ETH, which was sent to a cryptocurrency mixer.</p>



<p>According to the security firm <a href="https://twitter.com/BlockSecTeam/status/1668084629654638592">BlockSec</a>, the attacker of Sturdy Finance exploited the read-only reentrancy in the protocol&#8217;s price balancer to manipulate the price of the BstETH-STABLE pair.</p>



<p>&#8220;This technique is commonly used by <a href="https://zycrypto.com/hackers-steal-23-million-in-ether-shiba-inu-and-other-tokens-from-singaporean-exchange-bitrue/">hackers</a> to withdraw funds from DeFi protocols,&#8221; says BlockSec.</p>



<p>It involves taking advantage of the ability to repeatedly call a function in a single transaction before the first function call has been completed. Thanks to this, hackers can withdraw more money than should be possible.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Sturdy Finance hack exposes the vulnerability of DeFi platforms</strong></h2>



<p>Attacks on DeFi platforms have increased over time, leading many to consider this ecosystem a paradise for <a href="https://zycrypto.com/north-korean-hackers-linked-to-45-of-3-8-billion-crypto-theft-in-2022-chainalysis-reports/">hackers</a>. The theft of $625 million from Ronin Bridge and the $197 million stolen from <a href="https://zycrypto.com/euler-finance-197-million-hack-bears-links-with-north-korea-but-it-could-all-be-one-big-misdirection/">Euler Finance</a> are just examples of the vulnerability of these platforms.</p>



<p>Due to financial transactions in DeFi occurring on the blockchain without intermediaries, there is an inherent risk. This lack of regulation and decentralization makes decentralized finance platforms vulnerable to attacks.</p>



<p>Despite these challenges, DeFi has continued to evolve and demonstrate impressive growth. However, it is necessary for security also to evolve to create a safer environment for users.</p>

<ul>
<li>Top assets lost value this week, with ADA shedding 22% and market leader BTC plunging to new lows not recorded in months. </li>



<li>The wider market was hit with deep losses wiping off $40 billion from the total market cap in 24 hours.</li>



<li>Observers say the market had a slow adverse reaction to the Fed&#8217;s uncertain stance on interest rate hike before the full impact on Thursday.</li>
</ul>



<p>Bitcoin (BTC) dipped below $25,000 for the first time in three months after the Feds signalled more interest rate hikes could be implemented.</p>



<p>The digital asset market was a sea of red as many coins posted weekly losses. Leading the losses in the top 20 by market capitalization was Polygon (MATIC), which plunged 24.1% and 8% in the past 24 hours. Solana (SOL) recorded a loss of 22.8% to trade at $14.54. </p>



<p>The past seven days have seen Cardano (ADA) lose slight gains it picked up this month. The community dubbed <em>ETH Killer </em>shed 22% of its value this week and 7% over the past 24 hours. XRP also saw a price correction after its community went into a frenzy following the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-demands-investigation-into-former-sec-director-hinman-and-his-controversial-speech/">revelation</a> of the Hinman documents. XRP exchanges hands at $0.475 after losing 5.44% in the past week. </p>



<p>Other altcoins posted huge losses, including Polkadot (DOT), BNB, Avalanche (AVAX) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), which recorded losses of 13.96%, 12.4%, 19.4%, and 17%, respectively. BTC bulls were left stunned after the asset dropped below the $25,000 mark for the first time in three months. At press time, BTC trades at $24,950, with several on-chain metrics pointing upwards for the asset. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-feds-keep-market-on-edge"><strong>Feds keep market on edge</strong></h2>



<p>At the release of the recent Consumer Protection Index (CPI), the entire market anticipated a renewed push for most assets as many predicted the Feds would end the 14-month hike in interest rates. Although interest rates were maintained after positive inflation data, the Feds noted that rates could still go up towards the end of the year.</p>



<p>A rate hike is detrimental to the market as it blunts investor excitement leading to a departure from risky assets. According to Josh Gilbert, an eToro market analyst.</p>



<p>“<em>Much of the positivity we’ve seen from risk assets this year, including Bitcoin, is built on the expectation that inflation will fall and interest rates will peak, and then begin to be cut. Inflation is moving in the right direction but the comments from Jerome Powell signify that rates could stay higher for longer, which would put Bitcoin on the back foot,” </em>he explained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The stock market also reacted similarly to cryptocurrencies following comments from the Feds as both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq dropped points.</p>

<p>Latest on-chain data shows the Ripple network is expanding as the number of new XRP addresses increases.</p>



<p>According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, these increases in addresses usually signal a potentially significant price growth.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/cuwa9LGQxoGDiSDABAaQ6P2zrC3ytnAdD_LAlZfP4eUYi9IDwgs4plhQeeKgQgWr20ihEioYpj3HWG2aApmQJPAnuTWw7_-NUlFwn3egazCFnULKOmG2g8nN04X7jU3FmcIThKzTMEbgCpQ3YASMuBg" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Network Growth (XRP). Source: Santiment</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-xrp-preparing-for-its-next-rally"><strong>Is XRP preparing for its next rally?</strong></h2>



<p>As <a href="https://zycrypto.com/a-new-boom-for-xrp-record-breaking-address-activity-indicates-upturn-ahead-to-1-xrp-price/">reported</a> by ZyCrypto, the surge in new addresses helped drive the price of XRP above the psychological resistance of $0.50, reaching a peak of $0.056 on Tuesday as the XRP Army continue to envison the $10 price point.</p>



<p>Although the increase in addresses could be a bullish signal suggesting the next XRP rally, it&#8217;s not a completely reliable indicator.</p>



<p>Investors focus on the outcome of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple, alleging that XRP is a Security. Recently, District Judge Annalisa Torres ordered the inclusion of former SEC director William Hinman&#8217;s speech in the case documents, where he stated that Ether is not a Security token.</p>



<p>The use of these documents is crucial for Ripple in the case, as it could help the company demonstrate that, like ETH, XRP is not a security token.</p>



<p>Additionally, a victory in the Ripple lawsuit could have significant implications for the price of XRP and the cryptocurrency market as a whole. According to several experts, Ripple and its token are undervalued, considering the company&#8217;s reserves exceed four times its market value. Furthermore, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-contemplates-ipo-as-sec-lawsuit-finally-nears-end-will-it-propel-xrp-to-10/">Ripple has expressed its desire to go public</a>, generating significant interest from institutional investors.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>XRP retreats 7.4%</strong></h2>



<p>Today, the price of XRP experienced a 5.4% retreat, according to CoinGecko data, following the recent <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">SEC lawsuit</a> against Binance.US, Binance International, and Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao. The lawsuit alleges that the exchange allowed North American users to use the international platform without regulatory permission to operate an unauthorized security token.</p>



<p>Furthermore, they were accused of using unauthorised user funds, transferring them to other international entities, thus evading federal laws.</p>



<p>However, despite the current decline of XRP, several indicators, such as moving averages, VPVP, and ADX, among others, continue to project a bullish trend on daily timeframes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/y4Usp67GHk8PYDgNKdZHdJvr75RaboxyhU9wEsPhZwcDCGogmJqrOdrFk2vlsgYeASGHUBwLxO7yVmttjkQNNgSomeMdYZEgXzY0qjqWY8q7O6Ybz-yYcgJ90yR7977eKy-8PPLXD2PpCSU4SsK95Uk" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Therefore, XRP needs to respect the support zone to maintain its bullish movement above $0.45. If it stays above that zone in the coming days, it could likely target the next resistance at $0.60 in the short term.</p>
