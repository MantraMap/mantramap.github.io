He clarified that the BRICS members will focus on de-dollarization and promoting the use of national currencies in international trade instead of the U.S. dollar.</strong></p>
<h2>BRICS to Focus on Reducing Dollar Reliance</h2>
<p>The topic of a common BRICS currency is not on the agenda to be discussed at the economic group’s upcoming leaders’ summit, South Africa’s diplomat in charge of BRICS relations, Anil Sooklal, reportedly said Thursday.</p>
<p>South Africa, being the current chair of the BRICS group, will be hosting the summit in Johannesburg on Aug. 22-24. Sooklal explained that the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) will discuss using national currencies and reducing reliance on the U.S. dollar. He was quoted by Reuters as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>There&#8217;s never been talk of a BRICS currency, it&#8217;s not on the agenda &#8230; What we have said and we continue to deepen is trading in local currencies and settlement in local currencies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Recently, Russian news outlet RT <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-bank-official-discusses-common-currency-as-reports-of-gold-backed-brics-currency-gain-attention/">claimed</a> that the BRICS nations will announce a gold-backed common currency at the August summit. However, Leslie Maasdorp, vice president and chief financial officer of the New Development Bank, also known as the BRICS Bank, stated that the economic bloc has no immediate plan to launch a currency to compete with the U.S. dollar. Noting the distinction between de-dollarization efforts and the creation of a common BRICS currency, he stressed: &#8220;The development of anything alternative is indeed a medium to long-term ambition.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brazil&#8217;s President <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brazils-president-lula-voices-support-for-brics-currency/">Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva</a> and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov have championed the concept of a common currency as the BRICS nations endeavor to counter Western dominance in global finance. This followed heavy financial sanctions the West placed on Russia after it invaded Ukraine. The U.S. and its allies have frozen about $300 billion in Russian central bank assets, prompting many countries to seek alternatives to the USD.</p>
<p>Regarding de-dollarization, Sooklal explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>BRICS started a process that has been expedited as a result of the conflict, as a result of unilateral sanctions … The days of a dollar-centric world is over, that’s a reality. We have a multipolar global trading system today.</p></blockquote>

<p>Earlier this month, India&#8217;s foreign minister emphasized that currencies would remain “very much a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indias-external-affairs-minister-shuns-brics-currency-talks-prioritizes-rupees-strength-instead/">national issue</a> for a long time to come.” Russia&#8217;s central bank governor also expressed similar sentiments, noting that a BRICS currency would necessitate the consent of multiple parties due to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russias-central-bank-brics-currency-requires-consent-of-many-parties-faces-implementation-challenges/">implementation challenges</a>. Furthermore, South Africa&#8217;s central bank governor highlighted that a common currency would require the establishment of a banking union, a fiscal union, and macroeconomic convergence.</p>
<p>Sooklal also revealed that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-interest-soars-40-countries-seek-membership-as-de-dollarization-efforts-grow/">more than 40 countries</a> are interested in joining the BRICS bloc, with 22 of them having already submitted formal applications. The diplomat believes that the BRICS group could expand to include more than 50 countries.</p>

<h2>SEC Disagrees With Ripple Ruling on Retail Investors</h2>
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stated in a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/kz87iqjgtodx4yygbpooc/SEC-RESPONSE-in-Opposition-to-MOTION-to-Dismiss.pdf?dl=0&rlkey=qaluz6iw3um27i5jnat6jx6mq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new filing</a> for its lawsuit against Terraform Labs and its co-founder Do Kwon that some decisions in the court ruling on the SEC v. Ripple case regarding <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> were wrong.</p>
<p>While noting that the Ripple ruling regarding institutional investors supports the SEC&#x2019;s claims, the securities watchdog stated: &#x201C;However, with respect to the programmatic and other sales, the SEC respectfully avers that Ripple conflicts with and adds baseless requirements to Howey and its progeny.&#x201D; The regulator added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Respectfully, those portions of Ripple were wrongly decided, and this court should not follow them. SEC staff is considering the various available avenues for further review and intends to recommend that the SEC seek such review.</p></blockquote>
<p>The SEC&#x2019;s filing was in response to a filing earlier this week from lawyers representing Terraform Labs and Kwon seeking to dismiss the regulator&#x2019;s lawsuit. In February, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Terraform Labs and Kwon, accusing them of engaging in a fraudulent scheme and selling unregistered securities, which resulted in the loss of at least $40 billion worth of market value.</p>
<p>The lawyers for Terraform Labs cited the Ripple <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ripples-chief-legal-officer-breaks-down-ruling-in-sec-lawsuit-says-as-a-matter-of-law-xrp-is-not-a-security/">ruling</a> as support for their motion to dismiss the lawsuit, stating that the Ripple decision &#x201C;confirms the legal insufficiency of the SEC&#x2019;s argument&#x201D; that certain tokens, including the failed stablecoin terrausd, were securities.</p>

<p>Following the Ripple ruling on <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler stated that the regulator is &#x201C;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-disappointed-with-xrp-ruling-on-retail-investors-chair-gensler-hints-at-more-crypto-industry-enforcement/">disappointed</a>&#x201D; with the ruling regarding retail investors.</p>
<p>While the crypto community celebrated the Ripple-<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> ruling, there were cautionary voices. Former SEC internet enforcement chief <a class="sc-hWhWUk dZhDeq" href="https://news.bitcoin.com/former-sec-official-warns-of-reversal-in-sec-v-ripple-ruling-on-xrp-says-the-decision-resides-on-shaky-ground/">John Reed Stark</a> and lawyer <a class="sc-hWhWUk dZhDeq" href="https://news.bitcoin.com/legal-expert-warns-victory-may-be-short-lived-for-ripple-and-xrp-says-judge-got-the-law-wrong/">Bryan Jacoutot</a> believe that the ruling rests on shaky ground, warning that the decision could be overturned.</p>
<p><em><strong>Do you think the Ripple ruling regarding <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> will be overturned? Let us know in the comments section below.</strong></em></p>

Bundle said users must withdraw or convert their digital assets to the stablecoin tether on or before Aug. 30.</strong></p>
<h2>Bundle Says Transition Period Is to Last 60 Days</h2>
<p>The Nigerian social payments platform, Bundle, said on July 20 that it was ceasing operations of its crypto exchange services and will now focus on the peer-to-peer platform known as Cashlink. In a statement, Bundle said the decision to shut down exchange services follows &#x201C;shareholders&#x2019; decision to restructure the business to focus on Cashlink.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Founded by Yele Bademosi, Bundle started operations in 2020 and at the time of the <a href="https://www.bundle.africa/post/we-are-saying-bye-to-our-exchange-services-and-here-is-why">announcement</a> the platform had 50,000 monthly active users and a monthly volume of $50 million. Cashlink, on the other hand, is reported to have recorded over 3 million transactions in under two years.</p>
<p>According to a Technext <a href="https://technext24.com/2023/07/21/bundle-africa-ceases-operations/">report</a> which quotes the CEO Emmanuel Babalola, the payments platform has adequately planned for a transition phase expected to last 60 days.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Irrespective of this early exit, Bundle Africa has made its mark on the African continent, providing our users with a best-in-class experience for crypto, making it easier and safer to access crypto services. Our users can withdraw their funds into any wallet. Over the next 60 days, we will provide our users and stakeholders with unparalleled support as we transition to Cashlink and other services,&#x201D; Babalola said.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>
<h2>Asset Deposits and Swaps Disabled</h2>
<p>As a result of this move, Bundle asked users of the platform to withdraw their digital assets to crypto exchanges of their choice.

The crypto community is abuzz with chatter, contemplating how these substantial decreases in block rewards will transpire over the ensuing two decades, and speculating on how miners will cope with the impending reductions. The following is a glimpse at the timeline of these subsidy transformations and a projection of the future rewards in the distant horizon.</strong></p>
<h2>From 50 to 1 Satoshi &#x2014; Decoding Bitcoin&#x2019;s Future Block Subsidy</h2>
<p>A fortnight ago, Bitcoin.com News <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoins-2024-halving-presents-new-challenges-a-deep-dive-into-the-future-of-mining-rewards/">explored</a> the looming Bitcoin halving and examined how bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) miners will need to rely on a blend of inflated <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> prices and transaction fees to withstand their revenue being cut in half. At present, we&#x2019;re left to scrutinize past block reward halvings and theorize about future ones, since the exact unfolding of events remains a mystery.</p>
<p>Yet, thanks to Bitcoin&#x2019;s structured and predictable design, the community has a fair estimate of the timing for each halving. Following the upcoming halving set for <a href="https://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com/dashboard/">April 2024</a>, the subsequent event in 2028 will further whittle down the reward to a scant 1.5625 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. The quadrennial span succeeding the 2028 halving will witness the final block rewards exceeding a single <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>.</p>
<p>The 2032 halving will dwindle the block reward subsidy from 1.5625 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> to a mere 0.78125. Post the 2028 halving, Bitcoin&#x2019;s annual inflation rate will <a href="https://charts.bitbo.io/inflation/">hover around 0.41%</a>, and by 2032, it will contract to 0.21%. Come 2036, the block reward will whittle down to less than half a coin, precisely 0.390625 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>.</p>
<p>In the subsequent four-year period following 2036, the reward will remain above a quarter coin, but by 2040, it will diminish to a lean 0.1953125 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. The block reward will hover above 0.1 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> for the ensuing four years, or 210,000 blocks, but will contract to 0.09765625 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> by 2044. Beyond 2044, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> will witness successive reward halvings in a host of years, extending from 2048 to 2136.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-598992 size-full" title="Charting Bitcoin's Predictable Course: A Comprehensive Review of the Next 29 Reward Halvings" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/5021.jpg" alt="Charting Bitcoin's Predictable Course: A Comprehensive Review of the Next 29 Reward Halvings" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/5021-300x169.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/5021-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/5021-768x432.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/5021-190x107.jpg 190w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/5021-380x214.jpg 380w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/5021-760x428.jpg 760w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/5021.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>By the time we reach 2136, the block reward will have diminished to a solitary satoshi or 0.00000001. In a closed economy, where Bitcoin&#x2019;s growth grinds to a halt, miners may grapple with significant challenges if adoption plateaus. This raises a pivotal question &#x2014; Once the block subsidy is reduced down to a lone satoshi in 2136, what will serve as the incentive for miners to continue fortifying the blockchain&#x2019;s security?</p>

<p>The prevailing theory posits that as Bitcoin garners broader acceptance and transaction demand surges, escalating transaction fees will offer an enticing incentive for miners, encouraging them to persevere in safeguarding the network despite dwindling block rewards.</p>
<p>To optimize their earnings, miners will most likely have to prioritize high-fee transactions. This sets up a finely balanced dynamic, and it&#x2019;s still uncertain how the network will adapt as block rewards progressively diminish. Every halving witnessed so far has placed miners under scrutiny, and each forthcoming halving will amplify the pressure on mining participants substantially.</p>

<h2>Top 10 Countries&#x2019; Real-Time Transactions Could Net Bitcoin Miners $89 Billion a Year</h2>
<p>Some argue that this theory relies significantly on the burgeoning adoption of <a href="https://www.bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf">peer-to-peer (P2P)</a> transactions, as a stagnant, closed-loop economy burdened with high fees could potentially buckle under its weight. Should adoption proliferate to billions of users within a globe inhabited by eight billion individuals, onchain fees, even if nominal, could offer miners a substantial reward.</p>
<p>For instance, the leading ten nations clocked a combined total of <a href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/charts/real-time-payment-transactions-by-country/">118.3 billion</a> real-time payment transactions in 2021, averaging a staggering 324.4 million transactions per day (tpd). If the Bitcoin blockchain could stretch its scaling capabilities to manage 324.4 million tpd with a <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-median_transaction_fee.html#3y">median fee</a> of $0.76 per transfer, miners could rake in a windfall of $246,544,000 daily.</p>
<p>As it stands, miners <a href="https://www.theblock.co/data/on-chain-metrics/bitcoin/bitcoin-miner-revenue-daily">accrued</a> approximately $27.67 million in revenue on July 20, 2023, from the daily block reward and fees on <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> transactions. The record high for daily mining revenue in the year was $35.35 million on May 12, 2023. Consequently, a hypothetical daily profit of $246 million from fees would far outstrip current miners&#x2019; earnings.</p>

Both Delta Police and Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Richmond have issued warnings after having dealt with multiple robberies involving prominent cryptocurrency investors over the past year.</strong></p>
<h2>Wealthy Crypto Investors Become Targets in Canada</h2>
<p>Over the last 12 months, numerous home invasions have targeted wealthy digital currency investors throughout Canada. A <a href="https://deltapolice.ca/media/police-issue-warning-high-value-cryptocurrency-investors-following-home-invasion-style">press release</a> from Delta Police headquarters reveals that both Delta and Richmond’s Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) have responded to several such incidents.</p>
<p>“It appears someone is targeting these victims for cryptocurrency, and we believe this public warning is necessary in the interest of public safety,” staff sergeant Gene Hsieh of the Richmond RCMP Major Crime Unit stated.</p>
<p>Authorities have chosen not to disclose specific details, including the number of crypto assets involved. However, they did mention that &#8220;large amounts&#8221; were at stake in these cases, and investigations are currently underway. One arrest has been made, but it remains unclear whether the individual is connected to the other home invasions. In each case, the perpetrator disguised themselves as an authoritative figure or delivery person to enter the victims&#8217; homes.</p>

<p>After breaking in, the suspects quickly extract information that allows them access to the victims&#8217; cryptocurrency accounts, according to law enforcement officials. “The suspects appear to know the victims are heavily invested in cryptocurrency, know where they live, and are robbing them in their own homes,” remarked staff sergeant Jill Long of Delta Police Investigative Services.</p>
<p>Canadian police advise against letting delivery personnel enter your home, suggesting instead to request they leave packages outside. Additionally, they recommend keeping valuables in a safety deposit box or with a financial institution. The authorities also caution against discussing personal wealth with strangers and discourage mentioning it in public or on social media platforms.</p>

However, the industry experts at Santiment predict a bullish upturn, indicating that the digital asset might claw its way back to the $2,000 territory in the coming month. In Santiment&#x2019;s view, ethereum is reveling in its &#x201C;under the radar&#x201D; status, and researchers suggest while ether&#x2019;s market performance has been lackluster, &#x201C;patience tends to reward.&#x201D;</strong></p>
<h2>&#x2018;Under the Radar,&#x2019; But Not For Long, Santiment Report Suggests</h2>
<p>Similar to <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> prices, <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH/">ethereum (ETH)</a> markets have been rangebound and have traded between the $1,830 mark and the $2,000 per unit range since the end of June. Furthermore, like <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> being stopped at the $31K mark, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> prices have also been pushed back after reaching $2,130 in April 2023.</p>

<p>On Saturday, July 22, 2023, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> has been trading for prices between $1,885 and $1,905 per unit and the price has lost 2.7% over the past seven days. In a <a href="https://insights.santiment.net/read/ethereum-enjoying-its-time-under-the-radar-7342?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=twitter_eth_enjoying_time_under_radar_insight_b_072023/&fpr=twitter">report</a> published on July 21, Santiment analysts suggest <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> could climb back above the $2K range by next month.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Ethereum is sitting rather quietly at $1,895 while <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> and Chainlink have been grabbing headlines as of late. Our latest insight takes a look at the under the radar metrics that could be very well hinting at an <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> return above $2,000 and beyond,&#x201D; Santiment said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1682255539785592834?s=20">tweet</a>.</p>
<p>Santiment points to the recent <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/xrps-rise-causes-ripple-of-gains-in-crypto-economy/">XRP price rise</a> and details that &#x201C;several backtests&#x201D; reveal that numerous altcoins do well when &#x201C;traders are distracted by the other shiny assets on the block at the time &#x2014; And right now, that shiny asset is <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a>.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Moreover, Santiment talked about a &#x201C;potential upcoming price bottom&#x201D; and noted that panic sales could &#x201C;come pouring in&#x201D; to justify buys. Santiment also discusses address activity and the fact that ether tokens are &#x201C;overwhelmingly being kept in self custody.&#x201D; Santiment states:</p>
<blockquote><p>With less than 7% of coins on exchanges, the likelihood of huge sell-offs occurring remains lower than usual. This should be considered one of the best long-term bodes of confidence for the asset that had a somewhat disappointing halving (as far as price is concerned) in September, 2022.</p></blockquote>
<p>Analysts at Santiment have noted an atypical calm within the Ethereum community. They suggest that this phenomenon often arises when the cryptocurrency sector&#x2019;s focus shifts to other leading assets like <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> and LINK. &#x201C;Patience tends to reward, and we see no reason why <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> can&#x2019;t make a move to get back above $2,000 sometime in August, or even before the new month hits,&#x201D; the Santiment analysts wrote in their conclusion.</p>
<p><em><strong>As we navigate these calm waters, how do you foresee Ethereum&#x2019;s trajectory? Do you share Santiment&#x2019;s confidence in an August rebound above $2,000? Share your thoughts and opinions about this subject in the comments section below.</strong></em></p>

The move came as the global crypto market cap mostly consolidated during Saturday&#x2019;s session. Stellar was another exception, as the token rebounded from yesterday&#x2019;s loss.</strong></p>
<h2>Tron (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/TRX" target="_blank">TRX</a>)</h2>
<p>Tron (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/TRX" target="_blank">TRX</a>) was a notable gainer to start the weekend, with the price surging to a 20-month high.</p>
<p>After dropping to a low of $0.08035 on Friday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/TRX" target="_blank">TRX</a>/USD rallied to an intraday peak of $0.09317 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>This was the highest point tron has hit since December 2021, and comes following a breakout of a ceiling at $0.08600.</p>

<p>This coincides with the relative strength index (RSI) moving past its own ceiling at 70.00. It is now tracking at 71.35.</p>
<p>Earlier gains have since faded, with the token now back below the aforementioned resistance level of $0.08600.</p>
<p>This appears to be a result of traders capturing profits.</p>

<h2>Stellar (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XLM" 312015  target="_blank">XLM</a>)</h2>
<p>In addition to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/TRX" target="_blank">TRX</a>, stellar was also largely in the green on Saturday, as the token rebounded from Friday&#x2019;s losses.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XLM" 312015  target="_blank">XLM</a>/USD rose to a high of $0.1674 to start the weekend, which comes a day after trading at a low of $0.1561.</p>
<p>This rally resulted in stellar breaking out of a recent resistance level of $0.1620, and edging closer to a 15-month high of $0.1959.</p>

<p>One of the reasons for today&#x2019;s climb was the RSI racing past its own ceiling at the 70.00 mark.</p>
<p>Price strength is now overbought, which could prompt bears to reenter the market in anticipation of a sell-off.</p>

The market has been volatile during the past week, as recent winners took profits, following the XRP-related bull run. Ethereum remained below $1,900 on Saturday.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) started the weekend trading close to the $30,000 level, as markets consolidated following recent price volatility.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD rose to an intraday high of $30,046.00, which comes following an earlier low of $29,746.12.</p>
<p>The move sees bitcoin climb back above a recent support point of $29,800, which has held mostly firm for the past week.</p>

<p>One of the reasons for the stabilized floor is due to the relative strength index (RSI), which is hovering close to a support of its own at 49.00.</p>
<p>Currently, price strength is tracking at 49.77, with the next visible resistance point at the 50.00 mark.</p>
<p>In order for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> to climb beyond the $30,000 mark, this ceiling on the RSI will first need to be broken.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum was also consolidating during today&#x2019;s session, as the cryptocurrency remained below $1,900.</p>
<p>Following a high of $1,905.39 on Friday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD slipped to a bottom of $1,885.30 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>Similar to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, ethereum&#x2019;s decline saw the cryptocurrency fall to a key support point of $1,880 to start the weekend.</p>

<p>This comes as price strength hovers around its own floor around the 50.00 zone, which has been in place since the start of the week.</p>
<p>Despite this, it still appears that the 10-day (red) moving average is trending higher, however this could begin to shift in the coming days.</p>

Alderoty criticized the stance taken by Gensler, stating that he &#x201C;misstates the law&#x201D; by declaring that tokens, standing alone, are investment contracts.</strong></p>&#13;
<h2>Ripple CLO Stuart Alderoty Blasts SEC Chair Gary Gensler&#x2019;s Statements on Tokens Being Securities</h2>&#13;
<p>Ripple CLO Stuart Alderoty recently complained about the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler&#x2019;s statements on crypto given in a congressional hearing before the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee held on July 19.</p>&#13;
<p>Alderoty referred to Gensler&#x2019;s repeated points signaling that cryptocurrency tokens constitute securities, <a href="https://twitter.com/s_alderoty/status/1681756950965497866?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stating</a>:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p>It&#x2019;s outrageous that in today&#x2019;s Senate hearing, Mr. Gensler again misstates the law (and the Howey test), suggesting that tokens, standing alone, are investment contracts. Is the SEC really going to continue to be allowed to peddle these falsehoods?</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>On July 13, Ripple obtained a landmark <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-judge-rules-xrp-not-necessarily-a-security-on-its-face-sending-xrp-supporters-into-celebration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ruling</a> determining that programmatic sales &#x2014; sales executed on exchanges &#x2014; of the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> token could not be considered securities. At that time, Alderoty <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ripples-chief-legal-officer-breaks-down-ruling-in-sec-lawsuit-says-as-a-matter-of-law-xrp-is-not-a-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">celebrated</a> the verdict declaring that &#x201C;as a matter of law,&#x201D; <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> was not a security.</p>&#13;
<p>Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has also <a href="https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1680005238017908736?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remarked</a> on the importance of this decision, stating that the ruling directly affected &#x201C;the SEC&#x2019;s claims that nearly all tokens are inherently securities&#x201D; and that the ruling was &#x201C;likely to set a positive precedent for other digital tokens in the U.S.&#x201D;</p>&#13;
&#13;
<h2>Gensler&#x2019;s Remarks</h2>&#13;
<p>In the congressional <a href="https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/hearings/review-of-the-fy-2024-budget-for-the-us-securities-and-exchange-commission" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hearing</a> where the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee reviewed the SEC&#x2019;s budget for the fiscal year 2024, Gensler remarked that &#x201C;generally speaking, there is some group of entrepreneurs behind those projects,&#x201D; hinting at the possibility of many cryptocurrency tokens being under the jurisdiction of the Securities Act.</p>&#13;
<p>Later in the hearing, when asked by Senator Richard Durbin about the best ways of protecting American consumers from cryptocurrency in the future, Gensler answered that the agency had a &#x201C;robust authority,&#x201D; detailing that &#x201C;very few&#x201D; of these cryptocurrencies were out of their jurisdiction.</p>&#13;
<p>Nonetheless, Gensler mentioned bitcoin as one of the assets that does not have the attributes of an investment contract under the securities laws and that it would fall under the jurisdiction of the SEC&#x2019;s sibling agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).</p>&#13;

Elvira Nabiullina, Governor of the CBR, declared the bank was exploring different possibilities of integration with other CBDC systems to complete cross-border payments and settlements.</strong></p>
<h2>Central Bank of Russia Discusses Digital Ruble Integration</h2>
<p>The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) is already advancing discussions on integrating its central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital ruble, with the digital currencies of other countries. The governor of the CBR, Elvira Nabiullina, stated that many countries were already developing their digital currencies and that the bank was currently discussing the integration procedures that the digital ruble might undergo to interact with these.</p>
<p>According to TASS, the Russian state-owned news agency, Nabiullina <a href="https://tass.com/economy/1649281" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> that these discussions were directed at using the digital ruble in cross-border digital payments, an option already built into the design of the CBDC.</p>
<p>She stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two options are feasible here: interaction between our platform and another country&#8217;s digital currency platform, and establishing a common settlement center to which digital currency platforms can connect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nabiullina detailed both options were being discussed with friendly countries, explaining that the mainstream adoption of the digital ruble might happen in 2025, the same <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/central-bank-of-russia-digital-ruble-could-be-launched-as-soon-as-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">timeframe</a> given by CBR First Deputy Chairman Olga Skorobogatova on July 6, even before the approval of the law that gave faculties to the CBR regarding the CBDC.</p>

<h2>Deploying the Digital Ruble</h2>
<p>The interest of the CBR in deploying the digital ruble to make it part of its cross-border payments system is not new, as the bank had outlined these uses back in <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bank-of-russia-outlines-payment-models-with-digital-ruble-other-cbdcs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January</a>. At the time, the two options mentioned by Nabiullina for digital ruble cross-border payments were already being developed. Subsequently, a pilot trial of consumer-to-business (C2B) operations with over a dozen financial institutions and banks was also announced.</p>
<p>A comprehensive pilot test is slated to start in August, as the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian Federal Assembly, recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russian-state-duma-passes-digital-ruble-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved</a> the Digital Ruble law, defining the framework for issuing this digital currency. The CBR had <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bank-of-russia-to-start-testing-digital-ruble-with-real-users-on-april-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expected</a> to start this trial in April, but the State Duma failed to approve the related regulations, resulting in a delay.</p>
<p>The CBR recently issued rules for the digital ruble&#8217;s operation and its platform, opening a consultation period for this ruleset that ended on July 19.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think about the digital ruble&#8217;s integration with other digital currencies in the cross-border payments arena? Tell us in the comments section below.</strong></p>
