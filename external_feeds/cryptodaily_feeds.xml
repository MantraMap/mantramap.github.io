			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Fantom (FTM) is implementing a unique strategy of compensating developers for generating gas fees to boost its network activity. This bold initiative underscores Fantom (FTM) commitment to fostering a vibrant and dynamic ecosystem. Meanwhile, the spotlight is also on Sparklo (SPRK), a digital investment platform that's readying itself for stellar gains. Set against an increasingly digital economy backdrop, both Fantom (FTM) and Sparklo (SPRK) offer unique value propositions poised to reshape the cryptocurrency landscape.</p>
<p>Sparklo (SPRK): Poised for Massive Gains in the Digital Investment Arena</p>
<p>Revolutionizing the domain of digital investments in precious metals, Sparklo is primed for a disruptive leap. Uniquely, Sparklo provides the ability to purchase portions of an NFT, with each segment tied to a physical asset. Moreover, they present the exciting opportunity to own an entire NFT, leading to the ownership of the corresponding precious metal.</p>
<p>Navigating through its second presale phase, Sparklo is a lucrative prospect for potential investors. Valued at an attractive $0.03, leading experts in the crypto field anticipate a significant rise in its value. Projections depict a huge 1,500% surge by the end of 2023, offering substantial returns.</p>
<p>Sparklo's sturdy smart contract has been awarded the Interfi network's seal of approval after a comprehensive audit. In a preemptive measure to prevent rugpull risks, Sparklo has committed to secure liquidity for a whole century. Given the extensive research and promising prospects, Sparklo presents itself as an enticing investment opportunity in 2023. The tokens are available for acquisition in the links below.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY SPARKLO TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Fantom (FTM) Innovative Approach: Remunerating Developers for Gas Fees Generated</p>
<p>Fantom (FTM), a prominent player in the blockchain space, has just announced a unique initiative, the "Gas Monetization Program." According to the May 31 announcement, the Fantom (FTM) Opera network team will now compensate developers for the gas fees produced by their applications. To be eligible for the program, apps must have conducted over 125,000 transactions and been live on the Fantom network for at least three months.</p>
<p>Six Web3 apps, including ParaSwap, Beethoven X, Stargate, LayerZero, WOOFi, and SpookySwap, have already been approved and are actively partaking in this program. However, it's not unrestricted access for all developers, as those with inefficient gas contracts may face competition and potential suspension from the program. With this new program, Fantom (FTM) hopes to create an alternative revenue source for developers, encouraging a sustainable ecosystem.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum and Bitcoin have long been regarded as two top giants battling for supremacy in the crypto ecosystem. However, according to a top trader, Ethereum might be having the upper hand soon. In other news, Tradecurve's presale stage 3 has recorded immense growth in the past few days.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ethereum (ETH) Set for a Breakout Against Bitcoin (BTC) - Top trader</p>
<p>An influential trader within the crypto community known as Bluntz has recently shared his optimistic outlook on Ethereum in relation to Bitcoin. With over 223,100 on Twitter, Bluntz suggests that the Ethereum/Bitcoin pair is on the brink of a potential breakout.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Year-to-date, Bitcoin has performed Ethereum, gaining 63% compared to the latter&rsquo;s 56%. However, Bluntz believes the trend could change in the coming weeks, with Ethereum performing better than Bitcoin in the bull market. According to his analysis, if this breakout occurs, Ethereum's value would increase against Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Displaying a chart on his tweet, Bluntz pointed out a falling wedge pattern on the ETH/BTC pair, which typically indicates a bullish trend. On the other hand, he expresses concerns about Bitcoin's performance against the USD, emphasizing the breach of a crucial support level. As a result, the trader advised investors to limit their exposure to Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tradecurve (TCRV) Presale Gains Massive Traction In Stage 3</p>
<p>While a top trader is bullish on the prospects of Ethereum, Tradecurve, a new trading platform that could send the likes of Binance and Huobi packing, has gained increased attention in its Stage 3 presale. The sale of millions of Tradecurve utility tokens has captivated the attention of experts in the crypto community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tradecurve, a hybrid, decentralized trading platform has caught the attention of many investors as it aims to address several challenges faced by traders when using traditional trading platforms, including security, limited trading options, high trading fees, transparency, and privacy. Tradecure will be the first platform where users can utilize digital assets as collateral, users can trade forex, stocks, cryptocurrencies, and commodities on Tradecurve through a single account.</p>
<p></p>
<p>One of the platform's notable advantages is its user-friendly accessibility, eliminating the need for the KYC process. Traders can create an account with just an email and a crypto wallet. This anonymous trading sets Tradecurve apart from established platforms like Binance and Kraken. Moreover, Tradecurve offers an array of features, including algorithmic trading that allows users to subscribe to automated AI bots, high leverage starting at 500:1, and copy trading where newbies can replicate the trades of experienced traders for a given fee.</p>
<p>Currently, Tradecurve's utility token, TCRV, is up for presale available at just $0.015 per token. There is also a 25% deposit bonus for every purchase. Smart investors are already stashing up TCRV tokens before the price skyrockets. Besides, market experts anticipate a 50x surge during the presale stage and a staggering 100x increase upon the launch of TCRV, followed by its listing on a prominent Tier-1 CEX (Centralized Exchange).&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The native cryptocurrency behind Gate.io, GateToken, has fallen in value as the exchange witnessed nearly $150 million in outflows. Rumors surround the exchange that it might have been affected by the Multichain incident, and that the CEO cannot be reached.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gate.io saw a boost in usage following the collapse of the FTX exchange, as cryptocurrency investors looked at alternatives to trade at, but it is clear that CEXs are not the right choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decentralized alternatives like Tradecurve are taking over and we can see that the demand is here as the utility token behind the platform, TCRV has surged in value by 50%.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Gate.io Records $150 Million in Withdrawals and Worries Investors</p>
<p>According to data from DeFi Lama, among the top 10 CEXs on a global scale, Gate, it has seen the highest levels of outflow, which have affected the value of GateToken. The outflows over a 7-day and 1-month period are also high. It is unclear why so much money has been going outside of Gate.io currently, but the movement has hit the value of the GateToken hard, where the cryptocurrency dipped in value by 17.1% in the past month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of July 2, 2023, GateToken trades at $4.36. Within the last two weeks, GateToken dropped by 10.3%. In the last 24 hours alone, GateToken saw a decrease in its value by 2.6%. Based on this, it is clear that GateToken has entered the red zone and it is heading toward a downward trend.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The $150 million in withdrawals have affected GateToken in a negative way, so investors are looking to diversify with alternatives. TCRV is the utility token behind Tradecurve that has gained a significant level of attention as a result.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tradecurve&rsquo;s utility token TCRV Spikes by 50%</p>

The platform enables users the ability to trade anything from cryptocurrencies to any other derivative product without the need to complete a KYC procedure while also maintaining their privacy through the platform's DeFi capabilities.</p>
<p>Tradecurve offers traders a wide range of trading tools, such as algorithmic trading opportunities with the usage of AI, negative balance protection, a VIP account service, and even educational resources through a dedicated Trading Academy with subscription-based social trading.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the tiny spreads, risk management tools, native support for desktop and mobile, and a simple user interface, anyone will be able to use and understand Tradecurve. The TCRV token has spiked 50% in value and now trades at just $0.015 during Stage 3 of its presale.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>We are thrilled to introduce $RON, an ERC20 token poised to revolutionize the intersection of digital culture and politics. With the upcoming 2024 Presidential race, $RON stands as the pioneering token that embraces technological advancements, community engagement, and a progressive approach to governance. With a vision of technological innovation, $RON aims to bridge the gap between politics and crypto, setting a new standard for political campaigning in the digital age.</p>
<p>The project's vision is to leverage the power of blockchain and cryptocurrency to assist Governor Ron DeSantis in winning the presidential race and becoming the 47th President of the United States. As a MEME token, $RON embodies the commitment of its supporters to bridge the gap between politics and crypto, championing a more inclusive and innovative future.</p>
<p>Since its launch, $RON has achieved remarkable milestones, underscoring its potential for growth and community engagement. In just three days, the token reached an all-time high of 10.5 million USD, while gaining over 1800 new holders. These achievements solidify $RON as a promising investment opportunity in the dynamic world of blockchain technology and decentralized finance.</p>
<p>One of the key driving forces behind $RON's momentum is the public endorsement of Governor Ron DeSantis by Elon Musk. This endorsement has sparked anticipation of attention-grabbing tweets about DeSantis, directing the public's interest toward the original $RON token. The project's Smart Contract, which foresees Governor DeSantis's victory, is immutable and verifiable on the Ethereum blockchain, adding a historic dimension to the meme project trajectory.</p>
<p>A recent tweet by the account @ERC20DeSantis has sparked interest among cryptocurrency enthusiasts and supporters of Ron DeSantis. The tweet, which includes a link to donate Ethereum to an ETH address "our-great-american-comeback.eth," urges individuals to contribute funds towards DeSantis's campaign.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Notably, the tweet sets a target of 1 million engagements before the collected donations will be allocated to Ron DeSantis's campaign. This initiative showcases the growing intersection of digital currencies and political fundraising, highlighting the evolving dynamics of engagement and support in the modern era.</p>

This alignment positions $RON at the forefront of innovative token projects, capturing the attention of crypto enthusiasts and supporters of Governor DeSantis alike.</p>
<p>Investors and supporters of $RON can be assured of its potential for growth and impact in the following ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Technological Innovation: $RON represents a groundbreaking blend of digital culture and politics, showcasing an innovative approach to campaign financing. The integration of blockchain technology and digital culture in the political landscape may set a future trend, making an early investment in $RON potentially rewarding.</li>

Its early achievements, including reaching an all-time high within three days and attracting a growing community of holders, highlight the token's potential for growth and success.</li>
<li>Community Engagement and Movement: Investing in $RON means joining a dedicated community of supporters rallying behind Governor Ron DeSantis. This strong sense of community is expected to fuel the token's growth and success. Additionally, if Governor DeSantis emerges victorious in the presidential race, early investors could witness a groundbreaking event, potentially enhancing the token's value and reputation.</li>

By combining the power of blockchain technology with the enthusiasm of crypto-enthusiast DeSantis supporters, $RON aims to bridge the gap between politics and crypto, paving the way for a more inclusive and progressive future.</p>

Their expertise in trading, NFTs, and Solidity ensures a strong foundation for the project's success. Additionally, the team is supported by a dedicated marketing group, the Brother Marketing team, which brings its skills and creativity to amplify the reach and impact of $RON.</p>
<p>While the primary focus of $RON is to support Governor Ron DeSantis's presidential campaign, there are plans to introduce various forms of utility to the token. Staking incentives, NFTs, and other WEB3/DeFi-related utilities are among the possibilities that may be explored in the dynamic and ever-evolving WEB3 space. The $RON team remains committed to adapting to market trends and seizing opportunities that add value to the token and its community.</p>
<p>$RON is poised to set a new standard in political campaigns and digital assets, leveraging the power of blockchain technology and the support of a passionate community. With its pioneering spirit, $RON is driving an ascending trajectory that sets the pace for years to come.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Republican lawmakers Patrick McHenry and Glen Thompson have introduced a draft bill proposing clear roles and delineation of authority between the SEC and CFTC regarding crypto.&nbsp;</p>
A Clearer Regulatory Plan&nbsp;
<p>The draft bill, released on Friday, provides crypto assets and exchanges a clearer regulatory plan, enabling the trading of digital assets on more conventional trading platforms. It also seeks to introduce a division of authority between the two top US financial regulators. The draft, published on the 2nd of June, 2023, proposes establishing a functional framework that provides regulatory clarity for cryptocurrency firms and exchanges operating in the United States.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Key House Republicans Unveil Crypto Market Structure Draft Bill The draft legislation was unveiled today by House Financial Services Committee Chairman @PatrickMcHenry and House Agriculture Committee Chairman @CongressmanGT.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bill would prohibit the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from denying digital asset trading platforms from registering as a regulated alternative trading system. It would also allow the firms in question to offer payment stablecoins and digital commodities. The bill cracks down on the much-criticized approach of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which does not offer any clear rules or roadmap for the crypto space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the bill&rsquo;s framework, specific digital assets could qualify as digital commodities if they were functional and considered decentralized assets. It would also require the SEC to provide a complete and detailed analysis of any objections against the classification of a firm as decentralized. The draft states,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Act also requires the SEC to modify its rules to allow broker-dealers to custody digital assets if they meet certain requirements. Additionally, the Act would require the SEC to write rules to modernize certain regulations for digital assets.&rdquo;</p>

Crypto Space Lauds Draft Bill&nbsp;
<p>The crypto space praised the bill and initiative. Paul Grewal, Chief Legal Officer at Coinbase, stated that the draft bill lays a strong foundation for regulatory jurisdictions and definitions. However, he added that the bill needed an in-depth review before being formally introduced. Coinbase has recently launched a pro-adoption ad campaign as it looks to attend a lobbying-focused event to be held in Washington DC, in July.</p>
<p>However, the bill was introduced by Republican lawmakers and lacks any input from the Democrats. Both Democrats and Republicans have, at times, shown a willingness to take a bipartisan approach to crypto regulation. It is not clear how the proposed legislation would perform in a highly divided Congress. The US House and Senate have recently passed legislation that would stop the government from going into default. The legislation raises the debt ceiling, with President Biden expected to sign the bill into law by the 2nd of June.&nbsp;</p>
SEC vs. Crypto&nbsp;
<p>Cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the United States have long been calling for regulatory clarity as they grapple with enforcement action from regulators. As a result, many are moving to shift operations outside the United States of America. Prominent exchanges such as Gemini and Coinbase have announced off-shore operations. Coinbase is also locked in a courtroom battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission after it received a Wells notice earlier in the year. A Wells notice is a warning of impending enforcement action.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The market trends in the crypto industry have yet again sprung up new development that is forcing the hands of investors. As it stands, Sparklo has continued its meteoric rise in price and reputation among crypto investors because of the project's outstanding potential. However, the market price of coins like Near Protocol (NEAR) and XRP (XRP) has continued to struggle in the crypto market.</p>
<p class="s7">Investors are joyful as Sparklo (SPRK) keeps its consistent growth</p>
<p>The stability that the Sparklo project has shown in the past weeks is bringing smiles to early investors of the token. More investors have joined the Sparklo project in a bid to position themselves for potential moon-bound growth. Sparklo is an innovative blockchain-based investment platform that allows users to invest in profitable solid treasures like Gold, Silver and Platinum. Investors can also passively trade these assets using fractionalized NFTs as digital placeholders.</p>
<p>It is safe to say that the Sparklo token (SPRK) is one of the hottest tokens in the crypto market at the moment. Crypto experts have already projected a 1,000% rise in price value for the token before the end of Q4 of 2023. Currently, the SPRK token goes at the price of only $0.030 per token. Investors that purchase the SPRK token now will be given a 100% bonus for their purchase which will end in the next 48 hours. This means you have limited time to benefit from this bonus. Experienced investors will recognize that now is the best time to invest in the SPRK tokens for significant gains in the near future.</p>
<p>The safety and security of the Sparklo project have been vetted and approved through the Interfi Network. Moreso, BlockAudit Report Team has verified the project's KYC certification. The SPRK token will be locked for 100 years to avoid an event of a rug pull. Do not hesitate to invest in the Sparklo project, as we believe in the promising potential of the token. Click the link below to invest.</p>

<p class="s7">Near Protocol (NEAR) sees a crab-like price movement</p>
<p>Near Protocol (NEAR) is a community-driven cloud computing protocol that operates on the layer 1 blockchain to enhance the overall activities on the blockchain. Within the last 24 hours, Near Protocol (NEAR) saw an insignificant -0.18% loss in price value. This development pegs the price of the Near Protocol (NEAR) token at $1.56 at the time of writing. The trading volume of Near Protocol (NEAR) went down by -20.31% and currently stands at $40,745,164.</p>
<p>In the last few days, the Near Protocol (NEAR) price has not seen any upward price movement. The Near Protocol (NEAR) price chart shows that the coin is struggling to overcome the bear market. Despite all these, crypto experts still think that the price of Near Protocol (NEAR) will surge in the coming days despite the current price trajectory and the stats suggesting the contrary. Near Protocol (NEAR) coin holders have already joined the ongoing Sparklo project, which has proven to be a more viable investment option.</p>
<p class="s7">XRP (XRP) declines in price value amid fresh token released from escrow</p>
<p>XRP (XRP) is a decentralized open-source ledger that executes transactions in the blockchain network at a low-cost price alongside speed and scalability. In a fresh development, XRP (XRP) now has an additional 1 billion tokens added to its circulating supply in another monthly token released by the network. This development was executed through the escrow system which has 55 billion XRP (XRP) tokens locked in from December 17, 2021. These tokens have since then been released at 1 billion per month. However, the escrow system has seen divided opinions among experts as to whether it affects the price of the XRP (XRP) token negatively.</p>
<p>XRP (XRP) in the last 24 hours lost &nbsp;1.08% in price value. As a result, the price of XRP (XRP) is $0.50 at present time. The coin has made significant progress in the last few days and has gained over 5%. However, with the last 24 hours' price of XRP (XRP) not showing signs of a rally, the XRP (XRP) investors have moved over to the trending Sparklo project, where significant gains will be made. The Sparklo project is already giving a bonus for token purchase, which makes it one of the best crypto projects for now. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The XRP network activity saw record-breaking levels, and Solana's co-founder sees potential for the blockchain to become the "Apple of Crypto," indicating a bullish outlook for the value of both of these altcoins.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the latest hybrid exchange platforms, Tradecurve, also made waves in the blockchain community as its utility token, TCRV, spiked by 25%. We will go over the performance of each cryptocurrency to see how far they can climb in value by the end of 2023.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>The Future Potential of the XRP Cryptocurrency</p>
<p>While a vast majority of the cryptocurrency market saw a slowed down post-Memorial Day weekend, XRP has carried on towards a bullish direction, as its network has been recording massive spikes in address activity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The XRP network reached its second and third-largest spike in history during the past week, indicating that a major bullish rally can occur in the future, especially for the price of the XRP token, based on information shared by the blockchain analytics firm known as Santiment.</p>
<p>On May 27, 490,000 addresses interacted with the network, followed by another spike on May 28. As of May 30, 2023, the XRP cryptocurrency trades at $0.501280. During the past two weeks, its value spiked by 18.8%. In the last 24 hours alone, XRP has been up 4.2%. Based on analysts, the price of the XRP cryptocurrency can surge to its maximum point of $0.98 by the end of the year.</p>
<p></p>
<p>How Solana Might Increase in Value Moving Forward</p>
<p>Solana, the Layer-1 blockchain that originally launched in 2020, has seen some exciting news, as Raj Gokal, a co-founder of the network, told TechCrunch that "Solana has the potential to be the Apple of crypto." Apple has focused on user experience and performance, and as a result, Gokal said, "It all started with one relentless focus on a simple interaction that had to work perfectly."</p>
<p>The focus on Solana's core engineering and ecosystem is to create a network that feels like the regular internet, even though it is an entirely new financial internet. Solana might also try to compete with Apple by launching its own Android smartphone known as Saga.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the value of the Solana cryptocurrency, as of May 30, 2023, SOL trades at $21.27. In the last seven days, Solana increased in value by 7.2%, and in the last 24 hours alone, the cryptocurrency saw an increase in its value by 2.7%.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Why Tradecurve and Its Utility Token TCRV Has Appealed to Investors</p>
<p>Tradecurve is defined as a hybrid trading platform that completely avoids the need for KYC and lengthy registration procedures and instead lets users just deposit crypto and use it as collateral when trading.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This provides them with a complete level of anonymity, and better yet, the application allows trading not just crypto, but many other financial products, from CFDs to forex, indices, commodities, options, ETFs, and bonds.</p>
<p>Moreover, the team will also implement Proof of Reserves (PoR) and will launch a dedicated trading academy. Tradecurve features high leverage starting at 500:1, a VIP account service, negative balance protection, and algorithmic trading with AI.</p>
<p>As of May 30, 2023, the TCRV utility token is at Stage 3 of its presale, where it is offered at $0.015. Its next price target is $0.018, a value it will reach at the start of the Stage 4 presale.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This indicates that the cryptocurrency can increase by 20% initially, but analysts are bullish about its future and think it can climb 100x at launch, as 10,112,808 tokens have already been sold, indicating a high demand for the altcoin.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Better After Testing 26526:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 3 June 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) attempted to resume some upward traction early in the Asian session as the pair moved back above the 27000 figure after trading as low as the 26508 area, a relative low just below a downside price objective around the 26526.73 level that is associated with selling pressure around the 28057.23 area.&nbsp; Traders then lifted BTC/USD to the 27275.20 area during a rebound before some volatility returned and the pair depreciated to the 26976 area.&nbsp; Large Stops were recently elected below the 27477.07 area during the recent depreciation, representing the 38.2% retracement of the recent appreciating range from 25864.35 to 28473.93.&nbsp; Downside price objectives linked to the 28057.23 and 27875 levels include the 26335 and 25675 areas.&nbsp; Stops are cited below the 26422 level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTC/USD depreciated approximately 7.1% in May and has appreciated approximately 64.3% year-to-date.&nbsp; Additional downside price objectives include the 25474, 25442, 24705, 24440, 23208, and 22769 levels.&nbsp; Following recent price activity, areas of technical resistance and potential selling pressure include the 29048, 29143, and 29813 levels.&nbsp; Upside retracement levels in recent depreciating ranges include the 28700, 28741, 28868, 29243, 29299, and 29284 levels.&nbsp; Above the market, upside price objectives include the 30420.74, 31237.11, 31477.37, 32501.23, 32556.73, 32989.19, 34583.96, 34658.69, 35222.66, 37765.28, and 38403.97 levels.&nbsp; &nbsp;Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 200-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;below the&nbsp;100-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 27006.77 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 26980.83.</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;25604.51/ 24440.41/ 22769.39 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Central Bank of UAE (CBUAE) has set forth comprehensive guidelines for digital asset KYC, to be implemented next month.&nbsp;</p>
Transparent crypto regulation
<p>The new guidelines will require financial institutions to conduct thorough due diligence exercises alongside identity verification checks before approving any digital asset transactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crypto businesses worldwide are doing their best to comply with current regulatory changes happening in various jurisdictions worldwide. It&rsquo;s for this reason that many seek regions with crystal clear regulations and standardised guidelines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The UAE, known for its transparency in crypto regulation, has become an attractive haven for these businesses as it now gradually positions itself as a candidate for the next global crypto hub.&nbsp;</p>
A new regulatory framework
<p>The new regulatory framework provided by the CBUAE contains custom-tailored solutions targeting risks attached to virtual assets and virtual asset service providers purposely designed to enhance supervisory and regulatory frameworks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"These crucially important efforts are essential elements towards safeguarding our financial and monetary system's integrity along with stability, following Financial Action Task Force standards,"&nbsp;</p>

<p>reiterated Governor Khaled Mohamed Balama.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a comprehensive 44-page document outlining explicit definitions of virtual assets alongside their service providers&rsquo; business models, the documentation emphasises the strict legal obligations placed on licensed financial institutions through provision of effective tools tailored to enable them to navigate across the rapidly evolving virtual asset industry landscape.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To further demonstrate its commitment towards providing optimal safety together with superior well-regulated environments for cryptocurrencies including NFTs among other digital assets; Dubai established a dedicated regulator - Securities &amp; Commodities Authority (SCA) which oversees operations within the country's digital asset sector while at the same time streamlining its licensing processes by providing clarity regarding operational procedures except for companies operating within certain economic free zones.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Stablecoin Tether has fought through the challenging stablecoin market and propelled its market cap to reach an all-time high of $83.2 billion.&nbsp;</p>
USDT Hits ATH
<p>According to data from multiple sources, stablecoin issuer Tether&rsquo;s USDT has emerged from the gloom and doom of a declining stablecoin market to hit a record-breaking market cap of $83.2 billion. The stablecoin hit its all-time high on Thursday, taking it just over its peak from a year ago, and now commands 7.5% of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. This signifies a growing demand for USDT, especially in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Despite regulatory concerns and increased competition, Tether has continued to dominate the stablecoin landscape, cementing its position as the largest stablecoin by market capitalization.</p>
Increased Scrutiny On Stablecoin Market&nbsp;
<p>The stablecoin market especially suffered monumentally after the dramatic implosion of the Terra/LUNA ecosystem in May 2022. It was exacerbated by the increased scrutiny from regulators and central banks around the world that wanted to prevent a repeat of the catastrophic event.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Circle-issued USDC, which is the second largest stablecoin, was also hit badly by the downfall of its banking partner Silicon Valley Bank in March. Even the one-time $20 billion market cap Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin also saw its struggles when issuer Paxos was forced by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to stop minting new tokens.</p>
USDT Comes Through With Peg Stability
<p>Although USDT, too, struggled in the challenging market environment, losing around $18 billion of its market cap, it was able to regain the lost market capitalization and hit a new record high at $83.2 billion. While stablecoins have faced scrutiny from regulators and central banks around the world, Tether has managed to thrive amidst the challenging environment. Its ability to maintain a stable value pegged to the US dollar has attracted investors seeking a reliable digital asset that mitigates volatility often associated with cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>In fact, as a report from digital asset researcher Kaiko notes,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tether&rsquo;s rise suggests peg stability is far more important for most stablecoin holders than issuer transparency.&rdquo;</p>

Success And Controversy
<p>The surge in Tether's market cap can be attributed to several factors. First, the increasing adoption of digital assets by mainstream financial institutions has bolstered demand for stablecoins as a means of facilitating transactions and providing liquidity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, Tether's market cap growth is indicative of its expanding user base. DeFi platforms also rely on stablecoins like Tether to facilitate lending, borrowing, and yield farming activities, further contributing to its rising market cap.</p>
<p>Despite its success, Tether has not been without controversy. The stablecoin has faced allegations of lacking transparency and adequate backing for its reserves. However, Tether has consistently maintained that its reserves are fully backed by assets, predominantly cash, and short-term debt instruments.</p>

<p>Despite its success, Tether has not been without controversy. The stablecoin has faced allegations of lacking transparency and adequate backing for its reserves. However, Tether has consistently maintained that its reserves are fully backed by assets, predominantly cash, and short-term debt instruments.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin is trading over 1% higher on Friday and certain cryptocurrencies have broken trend before the US unemployment figure is released later today.</p>
Worse jobless figure expected
<p>With Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell intimating that he is ok with the economy going into recession and &ldquo;things breaking&rdquo;, as long as inflation can be beaten, it does look as if the US is entering a risk off period for quite some time.</p>
<p>One of the main figures that the Fed looks at before deciding whether the economy needs yet another interest rate hike is the jobless count. The forecast here is for a rise to 3.5% from the previous figure of 3.4%.</p>
<p>However, even amidst this gloomy period Bitcoin is still looking like it has entered its bull market and current times are perhaps good ones for accumulating ahead of a possible descent into recession next year.</p>
Bitcoin wakes up positive
<p>Bitcoin woke up this morning in a positive mood and is moving higher again in its sideways range from around $25,800 to $27,670. Current price is at just over $27,000.&nbsp;</p>
Ethereum to steal the show
<p>Be that as it may, ethereum looks as though it is making its move in order to steal the show from bitcoin. Ethereum has broken the downwards trendline with bitcoin that has been in force since early January this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ethereum dominance has also broken higher and has returned to the levels also seen in early January, but far more importantly these are the same levels from May 21, and even as far back as September 17. A solid and continuous accumulation above this level can potentially see ethereum on route to a flippening of bitcoin.</p>
Altcoins running
<p>Many of the altcoins are running strongly right now. Arbitrum, the ethereum layer 2 solution, is up around 8% at time of going to press. Andrew Kang, a large holder, is rumoured to have leveraged his position to buy more.</p>
<p>Injective Protocol is an altcoin that just runs and runs. It is currently up 10.5% on the day. Ocean, one of the AI-related plays is up 7.4% today having climbed 27.7% just since May 29.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lido, the largest of the liquid staking tokens, another really hot niche, is up 7.3% currently.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Uniswap DAO has voted against a proposal to turn on protocol fees for liquidity providers. The poll saw 45% opposed to turning on proposal fees, while support for two fee plans was divided.&nbsp;</p>
A Divided Community&nbsp;
<p>The community vote ran neck and neck and concluded at 1.05 PM ET on Thursday, with extremely close results and a divided community. Looking closely at the poll, 45% of the votes expressed complete opposition to the proposal to turn on fees. 42% of the votes supported the proposal to charge 1/5 of the pool fee across Uniswap V3 pools, while the remaining 12% voted in favor of charging 1/10 of the pool fee, and 0.04 voted in favor of charging 1/6 of the pool fees.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uniswap fee switch vote neck and neck in the final hours. Fun fact, I don&rsquo;t think any UNI vote that&rsquo;s passed on snapshot has been turned down once proposed on-chain.&rdquo;</p>

Divided Support
<p>However, it is worth noting that the proposal failed to pass despite 54% of the votes cast favored charging liquidity providers protocol fees. However, those supporting protocol fees were sharply divided regarding how much liquidity providers must be charged, as seen in the breakup of the voting preferences. This meant that while support for charging a fee collectively surpassed the opposition to implementing a fee (55% vs. 45%), no category exceeded the support for the &ldquo;no fee&rdquo; votes. 56 million UNI tokens were used to cast the votes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another factor that potentially swung the votes towards those that voted against implementing a fee was a handful of wallets that voted against protocol fees at the last minute. A closer look at the history of the wallets in question revealed that the addresses linked to the wallet were only recently created and had nearly zero transaction history prior to the vote. Chris Blec, a DeFi researcher, commented on the results stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The whales that dominate Uniswap governance (a16z, Hayden, etc.) refuse to activate the fee switch because they don&rsquo;t want to create a legal liability. The irony is that they&rsquo;re still creating legal liability by using their massive voting power to kill every fee switch proposal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The result will not prevent further votes by the community on the proposal. While support is high, opposition to the fee is also significant.&nbsp;</p>
Should The Fee Be Implemented?&nbsp;
<p>The initial proposal behind introducing protocol fees stated that the fee would demonstrate Uniswap&rsquo;s revenue-generating capabilities. The protocol stated that the fee would also indicate that liquidity providers are operating professionally and earning enough revenue to not require any sort of rebates. Governance members expressed some support for the proposal, but many noted that the decision to implement fees could carry legal and regulatory implications, with regulators potentially considering a fee-generating Uniswap as a security. Furthermore, the proposal could require the payment of income tax as well. The current proposal indicated that it would not impact fees paid by most Uniswap users and would collect fees directly from liquidity providers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proposal was put forward on the 10th of May by GFX Labs, the Uniswap Governance Delegate. The protocol&rsquo;s current fee structure offers several rebates to liquidity providers, who made over $77 million in fees during the month of March alone. While putting forward the proposal, its author, Getty Hill, stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Uniswap can monetize and bring in all these dollars by building a really great open-source protocol that gets usage, then that will incentivize other folks to do this too. I&rsquo;m hopeful that this kind of changes some of those industry norms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Uniswap can monetize and bring in all these dollars by building a really great open-source protocol that gets usage, then that will incentivize other folks to do this too. I&rsquo;m hopeful that this kind of changes some of those industry norms.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Circle has announced that it will be launching the USDC stablecoin natively on Arbitrum on the 8th of June, 2023.</p>
<p>According to the company, the move will replace the bridged version of the stablecoin from Ethereum, which is currently in circulation.&nbsp;</p>
Native To Arbitrum&nbsp;
<p>With the announcement by Circle, USDC will be native to Arbitrum and will be the official version of the stablecoin recognized across the Arbitrum ecosystem. It will also eventually replace the bridged version of the stablecoin from Ethereum. In its statement, Circle stated that Arbitrum would rename the Ethereum-bridged version of the USDC stablecoin as USDC.e ahead of the launch of the native USDC on the 8th of June, 2023. The company added that it would also conduct an outreach to other apps in the ecosystem to make the same changes in their documentation and application UI.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;USDC issued by Circle will be native to Arbitrum and will be considered the official version of USDC for the Arbitrum ecosystem. Over time, native USDC liquidity will grow and replace the currently circulating &lsquo;bridged USDC&rsquo; liquidity that comes from Ethereum.&rdquo;</p>

Benefits Of The Native USDC&nbsp;
<p>Circle highlighted several benefits of the native USDC launching on the highly popular Arbitrum layer-2 network. According to the company, the biggest advantage would be bringing Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) to Arbitrum. This would eliminate bridge withdrawal delays. Other benefits highlighted by Circle include upgradable smart contracts and the possibility of introducing institutional on and off-ramps, along with other improvements.&nbsp;Upgradable smart contracts would allow Circle to conduct future enhancements to the contract.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Circle also talked about liquidity migration in its statement, asserting that Arbitrum would collaborate with all ecosystem apps to ensure a smooth transition of liquidity from bridged USDC to native USDC. The Arbitrum Bridge will not undergo any immediate changes during the transition period. It will continue operating normally and bridge USDC to and from Ethereum.&nbsp;</p>
What The Future Holds&nbsp;
<p>Moving forward, Circle hopes to bring CCTP to Arbitrum following the launch of the native USDC stablecoin, which would allow the stablecoin to move natively to and from Ethereum and other chains within minutes, eliminating withdrawal delays. The announcement comes a month after Circle had announced the mainnet availability of the Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP). Circle has also announced plans to expand the Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol to other chains in late 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back in April, Circle&rsquo;s Vice President of Product, Joao Reginatto, explained that the Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol would give USDC native interoperability across the Web3 ecosystem. He further added that it would help the protocol address issues related to capital inefficiency and liquidity in decentralized finance (DeFi).&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With CCTP, developers can simplify the user experience, and their users can trust that they are always transacting with a highly liquid, safe, and fungible asset in native USDC. This milestone makes USDC a natively multi-chain digital dollar.&rdquo;</p>
