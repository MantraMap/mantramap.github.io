            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Shiba Inu ($SHIB) price is rebounding, with the token rising over the last week.</p>
<p>Following two bearish daily closes in a row, $SHIB is now exhibiting upwards momentum, prompting traders to reconsider their sentiment toward the token.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, fellow meme coins Wall Street Memes ($WSM) and Thug Life ($THUG) are also making waves as their respective presale phases continue to gather momentum.</p>
<h2>Shiba Inu on Cusp of Rally as Trader Optimism Spikes</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, $SHIB is trading around the $0.00000757 level, rebounding aggressively from the nearby support level at $0.00000735.</p>
<p>This rebound has provided the fuel needed for a possible rally, boosting investor optimism in $SHIB.</p>
<p>Price has also respected the rising trendline on the 4H time frame, which has been in play since June 28.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-7.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-259096" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-7.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="288" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-7.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-7-300x144.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-7-50x24.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>$SHIB has rejected this trendline three times in the past fortnight – indicating a firm support base for upward movement.</p>
<p>These recurring rejections indicate that crypto investors are &#8220;buying the dip,&#8221; hinting that Shiba Inu could have the potential for sustained momentum if it continues to hold above this crucial trendline.</p>
<p>Further adding to the bullish hypothesis, price is attempting to break through the 20-day and 50-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) on the 4H chart, which would signal a dramatic shift in market sentiment.</p>
<p>This sentiment shift may already be occurring – <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/shiba-inu" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CoinGecko community analysis</a> states that more than 66% of users are “feeling good” about $SHIB today.</p>
<h2>$SHIB Price Boosted By Token Burns &amp; Shibarium Excitement</h2>
<p>Several factors are playing into Shiba Inu’s resilience and impressive price rebound.</p>
<p>Firstly, as noted by the <a href="https://twitter.com/shibburn/status/1676818308169859073?s=20" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Shibburn</a> Twitter account, over 64.8 million $SHIB tokens were burned in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>This represents a 362% increase from the previous day – indicating a significant reduction in supply that may be contributing to the bullish price movements.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-7.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-259094" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-7.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="327" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-7.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-7-300x163.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-7-50x27.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Secondly, the main Shiba Inu News Twitter account, which boasts over 331,000 followers, <a href="https://twitter.com/ShibalnuNews/status/1676560229738205185?s=20" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> that the lead $SHIB developer Shytoshi Kusama is dropping hints that the long-awaited Shibarium network will launch next month.</p>
<p>Shibarium is a Layer-2 blockchain network being built for the Shiba Inu ecosystem on top of the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>This network promises to offer faster and cheaper $SHIB transactions, along with improved scalability – helping the Shiba Inu ecosystem grow and thrive.</p>
<p>Overall, the ongoing token burns and exciting Shibarium developments paint a promising picture for $SHIB in the short-to-medium term.</p>
<h2>Which Other Meme Coins Look Primed for Growth?</h2>
<p>As Shiba Inu gears up for a bullish phase, other meme coins are also presenting interesting growth opportunities.</p>
<p>Wall Street Memes and Thug Life are two such coins, both experiencing huge momentum in their respective presale phases.</p>
<h2>Wall Street Memes Could Be the Next Meme Coin King After Raising $12.8m</h2>
<p><a href="https://bs_54c27399.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=shiba-inu-coin-price-rebounds-as-traders-become-bullish-with-wall-street-memes-thug-life-also-rising" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Memes ($WSM)</a> has been gaining significant attention as it capitalizes on the cultural impact of internet memes within the crypto community.</p>
<p>The concept behind Wall Street Memes revolves around merging the world of finance with meme culture, which has proven to be a winning combination in recent years.</p>
<p>During the project’s ongoing presale phase, Wall Street Memes has managed to raise $12.8 million, showcasing the strong interest of early adopters.</p>
<p>The token’s appealing tokenomics, which sees large portions of the supply dedicated to marketing and community rewards, adds to its allure and highlights the developers’ focus on long-term sustainability.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-4.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-259091" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-4.jpg" alt="Picture4" width="602" height="301" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-4.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-4-300x150.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-4-50x25.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>This approach has been a huge hit with early investors, given that the Wall Street Memes <a href="https://t.me/wallst_memes" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Telegram channel</a> has grown to over 11,000 members.</p>
<p>Moreover, high-profile influencers are beginning to take note. Crypto Mario, who has nearly 500,000 subscribers, released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swsO411v3OM&amp;ab_channel=CryptoMario" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">video</a> claiming that $WSM could be the &#8220;next leader of meme coins.&#8221;</p>
<p>Endorsements like this have undoubtedly helped increase the buzz around Wall Street Memes, which has now reached fever pitch.</p>
<p>With the ongoing presale now in Stage 21 out of 30, over two-thirds of the token allocation has already been snapped up – meaning investors only have a limited time left to acquire $WSM at a discounted rate before its exchange listings.</p>
<p><a href="https://bs_54c27399.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=shiba-inu-coin-price-rebounds-as-traders-become-bullish-with-wall-street-memes-thug-life-also-rising" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><strong>Visit Wall Street Memes Presale</strong></a></p>
<h2>Thug Life Rides Meme Coin Wave with Ambitious Roadmap &amp; Nears $500,000 Milestone</h2>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.care/b_thuglife_33357?referrer=shiba-inu-coin-price-rebounds-as-traders-become-bullish-with-wall-street-memes-thug-life-also-rising" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Thug Life ($THUG)</a> is another meme coin currently making waves in the crypto scene.</p>
<p>Inspired by the popular “Thug Life” meme, the $THUG token has managed to capture the interest of retail traders worldwide.</p>
<p>The token’s ongoing presale has been highly successful, with over $480,000 raised in just one week.</p>
<p>Thug Life&#8217;s presale is unique in the sense that 70% of the token supply is reserved for early investors.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture5.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-259090" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture5.jpg" alt="Picture5" width="602" height="380" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture5.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture5-300x189.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture5-50x32.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>This strategy ensures that the community, not the developers, controls most of the token supply.</p>
<p>Adding to the excitement is Thug Life’s branding, which features the globally recognized persona of Snoop Dogg.</p>
<p>While there is no direct connection between Snoop and Thug Life, the fact that the well-known rapper is familiar with the crypto market suggests that there may be opportunities for future collaborations.</p>
<p>With Thug Life’s roadmap already laying out plans for CEX listings, token burns, and a $100 million market cap, the project looks set for success in the months ahead.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin charted a new 13-month high at precisely $31,500 earlier today but was sharply rejected at that point and pushed down hard by $1,500.</p>
<p>This has resulted in a lot of pain for over-leveraged long traders, as the total value of liquidations has shot up to over $140 million in a day.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>CryptoPotato</em> <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-cash-jumps-8-daily-bitcoin-challenges-31k-again-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">reported</a> earlier today BTC&#8217;s voyage to $31,000, which actually resulted in the asset breaking above that level and tapping $31,500 (on Bitstamp) for the first time in over a year.</li>
<li>This notable price surge comes amid growing interest in the asset, especially after BlackRock, and several other financial giants, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/not-just-blackrock-these-companies-have-also-filed-for-spot-bitcoin-etf-in-the-us/" data-wpel-link="internal">filed</a> to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF.</li>
<li>However, the tides quickly changed in the following hours as BTC was not only unable to continue upwards or remain at that level but was sharply driven south.</li>
<li>In a matter of an hour, the cryptocurrency plummeted by over $1,500 and slipped to just under $30,000.</li>
<li>Several altcoins have suffered as well, with ETH dropping below $1,900, while ADA, MATIC, AVAX, and DOGE have slumped by 3%.</li>
<li>Litecoin, on the other hand, has dumped by almost 6% in a day and has nosedived beneath $100. BCH and LEO remain among the few larger-cap alts still in the green.</li>
<li>This enhanced volatility has resulted in over $140 million worth of liquidations, <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">according</a> to CoinGlass. Somewhat expectedly, over 93% of all 46,000 wrecked traders have had long positions.</li>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PRESS RELEASE &#8211; Los Angeles, California, July 6th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p>DeSo, the leading layer-1 blockchain for decentralizing social media, has issued a groundbreaking challenge: a $1 million bounty for visionary founders capable of building a decentralized competitor to Reddit using its infinite-state blockchain. This unprecedented opportunity arises amid escalating discontent with centralized social media platforms, which monopolize content and data.</p>
<p>Reddit recently sparked controversy within its community following a decision to limit API access. This move provoked a series of 48-hour subreddit blackouts in protest. This price hike for their API has forced existing third-party developers to shut down as maintaining their applications becomes impossible.</p>
<p>As Reddit prepares to go public, it is paving the way for fresh products and its in-house developer platform. Reddit CEO Steve Huffman revealed an interest in capitalizing on the platform&#8217;s wealth of data: “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” he commented. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”</p>
<p><div class="embed"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WeaX3Wj6Tpg?showinfo=0"></iframe></div></p>
<p>This controversy and others highlight the ongoing problems with centralized social media platforms. It&#8217;s not just Reddit; the landscape of web2 social media is changing. Over the past weekend, <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1675214274627530754?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1675214274627530754%7Ctwgr%5E710eb89f7542583e9dfbe2e54ddcce2fe5db35ed%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Ftwitter-outage-prompts-response-from-elon-musk%2F" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Elon Musk </a>temporarily restricted the number of posts Twitter users can read per day, inciting significant backlash:</p>
<blockquote><p>“To address extreme levels of data scraping &amp; system manipulation, we’ve applied the following temporary limits: Verified accounts are limited to reading 6000 posts/day, Unverified accounts to 600 posts/day, and New unverified accounts to 300/day”.</p></blockquote>
<p>Against this backdrop, <a href="https://www.deso.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">DeSo</a> is rising as a viable challenger.</p>
<p>Positioned at the forefront of social media disruption, DeSo offers up to $1M to support builders ready to architect an on-chain alternative to Reddit. This opportunity facilitates the creation of a user-led, creator-owned decentralized platform, one where you own your content as securely as you own your Bitcoin.</p>
<blockquote><p>DeSo&#8217;s founder, Nader Al-Naji, reflected on the recent dissatisfaction with Reddit: &#8220;These protests represent a broader societal shift. They are indicative of a new paradigm in how creators and users interact with social media. As trust in mainstream media and corporations falters, people are gravitating towards platforms that grant them autonomy over their content and social graph, much like owning Bitcoin does with money.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>The DeSo Way</h2>
<p>Imagine an on-chain Reddit where users hold full control over their content and cannot be censored or banned at the protocol level. This concept introduces the idea of &#8216;community as an asset,&#8217; where users and moderators can directly own and monetize their content, transitioning from mere respect and clout to tangible rewards.</p>
<p>This is only possible on the DeSo blockchain, which offers novel monetization features, including creator coins, NFTs, tokens, tipping, etc. With DeSo, your identity, profiles, content, and social graph are 100% on-chain, fostering a censorship-resistant layer where the community can moderate at scale instead of a centralized gatekeeper.</p>
<p>This is a call to arms for ambitious founders and builders who want to make lasting changes to social media the DeSo way.</p>
<h2>Investment and Applicant Criteria</h2>
<p>DeSo is prepared to invest up to $1M to fund a Reddit competitor built on its platform. Ideal candidates are seasoned founders with robust technical expertise and a proven history of building consumer products from the ground up.</p>
<p>Candidates should thoroughly understand DeSo&#8217;s vision for a decentralized Reddit and have strategies for user acquisition and engagement in a crypto-native way.</p>
<p>An enticing pitch demonstrating early signs of positive user feedback and usage is also expected. All applications should be submitted on <a href="https://openfund.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Openfund.com</a> to enable detailed evaluation.</p>
<p>For comprehensive instructions on how to apply and more information about how to apply, please read our original proposal and our formal announcement.</p>
<p>Once fully comprehended the opportunity at hand, please submit your proposal with all relevant links<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc-KH29Tcbrt5KuMwLYnRbQWmyqbfoXqldFgjUJQQJiqLrNQg/viewform" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external"> here.</a></p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PRESS RELEASE &#8211; DUBAI, DUBAI, July 6th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p>The options trading market gets another boost thanks to yet another collaboration between the cryptocurrency derivatives exchange BIT and the duo of Darley Technologies and DWF Labs.</p>
<p>Just recently, BIT rolled out options tied to Cardano&#8217;s <a href="https://www.bit.com/usd-options?type=ADA" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">ADA</a> token in collaboration with strategic partner Darley Technologies and market maker DWF Labs. Today, LADYS Options marks a significant milestone in the industry as the world&#8217;s first Meme-coin Options brought to the market for both institutional and retail traders.</p>
<p>Options might be seen as an intimidating instrument for new traders or existing spot traders. This type of derivative gives the trader the right to buy or sell an underlying asset at a certain price on or before a specific date. The core functionalities of options are binary: the right to buy the asset is a call option, and the right to sell it is a put option.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our intention is to simplify access to options trading for all traders, providing an interface that is simple to understand and instruments that are in line with what communities are passionate about. Meme-coins are an excellent way to engage people to learn options trading&#8221; said Andrei Grachev, the Managing Partner of DWF Labs.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We are proud to announce the listing of LADYS options as the world&#8217;s first meme-coin options, made possible through the support of our esteemed partners, Darley Technologies and DWF Labs.&#8221; Said Justin Buitendan, the Global Head of Institutional Sales of BIT, &#8220;Meme coins have experienced rapid growth, and we are thrilled to provide our clients with an additional avenue to enhance their trading strategies. LADYS options mark the starting point of an exciting journey, and there are more exciting opportunities on the horizon.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The incredible popularity of the LADYS token, as well as the sudden sprout of related projects, made it the perfect candidate for the first Meme-coin Option to be traded, thanks to the alliance between BIT, DWF Labs, and Darley Technologies.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The venture capital fund Hashed Emergent will host a multi-chain Web3 conference in Bangalore, India, at the beginning of December this year. The event, dubbed &#8220;India Blockchain Week (IBW),&#8221; will touch upon the country&#8217;s increasing role in the cryptocurrency industry.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Indians have shown interest in digital assets lately (especially during the COVID-19 pandemic), whereas some leading crypto-related companies have decided to expand their presence in the Asian nation.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The First Such Event in India</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to a document seen by </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">CryptoPotato</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, the upcoming &#8220;India Blockchain Week&#8221; will be the first Web3 event with pan-industry agenda in India. It will last from December 4 until December 10 and include hackathons and parties.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The marketing agency &#8211; MarketAcross &#8211; will join the conference as the global media lead. The entity has played a similar role in other events, including Korea Blockchain Week, Paris Blockchain Week, WebX, and IVS Kyoto.</span></p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;We&#8217;re excited to bring the first world-class, pan-industry, and multi-chain web3 conference to India, finally giving it the attention it has always deserved.</p>
<p>Bangalore ranks among the most prolific startup hubs worldwide, and Indian startups in web3 have made a considerable impact on the industry, spearheaded by multiple hugely successful protocols and products. We believe that IBW will quickly become one of the most interesting and diverse gathering places for the crypto industry.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Simon Kim, CEO of Hashed, views India as &#8220;a tech innovation hub&#8221; that &#8220;has penetrated the crypto realm with a highly qualified pool of skilled talent and will lead a new wave of the blockchain industry.&#8221; He raised hopes that the conference could emerge as the main blockchain event in the county and position the nation on the global Web3 map.</p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Indians Flock to Crypto</span></h2>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cardano ($ADA) finds its recent momentum slowing down, with the token’s price dropping 5% in the past two days.</p>
<p>After a period of sustained positivity, it appears that the bears have regained control – leading many to speculate that $ADA may be on the precipice of another downtrend.</p>
<p>In contrast, new Web3 platform Launchpad XYZ ($LPX) continues to turn heads in the market and has succeeded in raising over $1.1 million through its ongoing presale.</p>
<h2>Cardano Stumbles as Bullish Momentum Comes to an End</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, the $ADA price is hovering around $0.286, following two bearish daily closes in a row.</p>
<p>Price has rejected the resistance zone at $0.300, which was also tapped at the end of June.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for $ADA bulls, price has broken below the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) – a commonly-used proxy for a token’s short-term trend.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-5.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-259008" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-5.jpg" alt="Picture1" width="602" height="288" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-5.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-5-300x144.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-5-50x24.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>This break below the 20-day EMA signals that bearish pressure could now start mounting on Cardano.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cardano/onchain-analysis/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CoinMarketCap</a> data, a whopping 88% of $ADA holders are out of the money at the current price – an indicator that the market conditions are causing unease among Cardano investors.</p>
<p>Not only that, but <a href="https://app.intotheblock.com/coin/ADA?pid=coingecko&amp;utm_source=coingecko_widget" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">IntoTheBlock</a> reveals that the number of large $ADA transactions has decreased by 24%, further evidencing the lack of interest from the crypto community.</p>
<h2>Regulatory Uncertainty Adds to $ADA’s Woes</h2>
<p>The recent price drop signifies that $ADA bulls are opting to take profits rather than wait for an extended uptrend.</p>
<p>Regulatory events in the US have pushed Cardano into murky waters after the SEC categorized $ADA (along with several other cryptos) as securities last month.</p>
<p>Following this, major platforms like Revolut, Robinhood, and eToro have announced plans to delist the token – adding further pressure to $ADA’s position in the market.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-6.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-259010" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-6.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="401" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-6.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-6-50x33.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>This decision to delist $ADA indicates a wave of caution from trading platforms, even though most in the crypto community contest the “security” label that the SEC has placed on Cardano.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the uncertainty surrounding the token has impacted its price, evidenced by its inability to sustain positive momentum for more than a few days.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this paints a complex picture for the future of $ADA, indicating that caution could be the watchword for crypto investors in the short term.</p>
<h2>Which New Cryptos Look Primed for Significant Growth?</h2>
<p>While the regulatory climate is placing constraints on Cardano, there are still opportunities for new and promising projects to emerge.</p>
<p>One such project that has been turning heads is Launchpad XYZ, which is demonstrating remarkable growth potential during its ongoing presale.</p>
<h2>Launchpad XYZ Revolutionizes Web3 Accessibility &amp; Raises $1.1m</h2>
<p><a href="https://bs_596f215c.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=cardano-price-momentum-stalls-while-launchpad-xyz-raises-1-1m" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Launchpad XYZ ($LPX)</a> is an exciting entrant to the Web3 space and is committed to making the complex investing landscape accessible to all users – regardless of their market experience.</p>
<p>This user-friendly hub offers a dynamic interface for trading and investing in various Web3 assets, including cryptocurrencies and NFTs.</p>
<p>Launchpad XYZ&#8217;s listings are backed by real-time insights and market analysis, making it simple for investors to discover promising Web3 projects – as the website states, users can &#8220;find the next $PEPE before it explodes.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-6.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-259011" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-6.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="351" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-6.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-6-300x175.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-6-50x29.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Not only that, but Launchpad XYZ has a dedication to education. Per the <a href="https://launchpad.xyz/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">whitepaper</a>, users can access resources that help clarify complex Web3 concepts, like DeFi and the metaverse.</p>
<p>Launchpad XYZ will also have a play-to-earn (P2E) gaming hub and a metaverse experience library, allowing users to access these immersive worlds without using multiple third-party platforms.</p>
<p>All of these features are fuelled by $LPX, Launchpad XYZ&#8217;s native token, which can also be staked to access premium perks – like trading fee discounts and beta P2E game invites.</p>
<p>The Launchpad XYZ presale is still ongoing, having raised an impressive $1.1 million thus far.</p>
<p>Early investors can purchase $LPX through the presale for just $0.0445 – a 26% discount on the planned exchange listing price.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The narrowing GBTC discount resulted from the renewed hope for a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Grayscale Bitcoin Trust&#8217;s (GBTC) share price discount has dropped below 27% for the first time in more than 14 months. The milestone has sparked optimism among investors and crypto enthusiasts, signaling a positive trend for the popular investment vehicle.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/Grayscale" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">data</a> from monitoring resource CoinGlass, the GBTC negative premium is currently at -26.76%. The last time the shares traded at this level was in May 2022 during the Terra LUNA saga, which sent the entire crypto industry into chaos.</p>
<h2>GBTC Discount Drops Below 27%</h2>
<p>GBTC, owned and operated by the world&#8217;s largest digital asset manager Grayscale Investments, has long been recognized as a prominent investment option for investors seeking exposure to bitcoin without directly owning the crypto asset. The trust holds a substantial amount of BTC, allowing investors to gain indirect exposure to the leading digital asset.</p>
<p>Over the past year, GBTC has struggled and experienced periods of trading at a significant discount to its underlying BTC holdings. The negative premium, a measure of the difference between the net asset value (NAV) of GBTC shares and the market price, has been a source of concern for investors and has often been attributed to the trust&#8217;s structure and unique characteristics.</p>
<p>The GBTC discount can be attributed to several factors, such as the crypto credit crunch in 2021, the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/gbtc-discount-narrows-by-over-42-as-grayscale-sec-face-off-inches-closer/" data-wpel-link="internal">rejection</a> of Grayscale&#8217;s Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) application, and the financial <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/cameron-winklevoss-issues-3-day-ultimatum-to-dcgs-barry-silbert-threatens-lawsuit/" data-wpel-link="internal">struggles</a> of its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG). In December last year, these events caused the GBTC discount to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/grayscale-ethereum-trust-discount-sinks-to-60-gbtc-down-to-45/" data-wpel-link="internal">reach a record high</a> of nearly 50%.</p>
<p>However, the recent narrowing of the discount below 27% marks a significant positive development for GBTC and its investors. The reduction indicates that the market is valuing GBTC shares more closely in line with the underlying BTC holdings, which has bolstered investor confidence and optimism.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s Behind GBTC&#8217;s Narrowing Discount?</h2>
<p>The narrowing discount likely resulted from the renewed hope for a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States. In mid-June, the world&#8217;s largest asset manager BlackRock <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-taps-31k-on-blackrocks-etf-refiling-aptos-jumps-10-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">resubmitted</a> its application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch such a product.</p>
<p>Shortly after the filing, other firms, including WisdomTree and Invesco, were <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/not-just-blackrock-these-companies-have-also-filed-for-spot-bitcoin-etf-in-the-us/" data-wpel-link="internal">inspired</a> to submit new applications for a spot Bitcoin ETF. Although the SEC said the recent filings were not &#8220;sufficiently clear and comprehensive,&#8221; the applications made investors bullish.</p>
<p>The discount on GBTC was 41.7% before BlackRock&#8217;s application and has been consistently decreasing.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Fink likened crypto to "digitizing gold" and outlined bitcoin as an "international asset" that could serve as a hedge against inflation.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Larry Fink &#8211; Chief Executive Officer of BlackRock &#8211; raised hopes that his company&#8217;s recent filing to launch a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the USA could make investing in the primary cryptocurrency less expensive and &#8220;democratize crypto.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The American regulators have not approved such a product yet. However, BlackRock&#8217;s outstanding record with the SEC made some believe it could become the first company with such a green light.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Praising Crypto (Bitcoin)</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In a recent </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6330640643112" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">interview</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> for Fox Business, Fink noted that BTC transactions are still quite expensive. As such, one of BlackRock&#8217;s efforts in the field is to remove that burden for investors:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;What we&#8217;re trying to do with crypto is make it more democratized and make it much cheaper for investors. It costs a lot of money right now to transact Bitcoin. We hope our regulators look at these filings as a way to democratize crypto.&#8221;<br />
</span></p></blockquote>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><span style="color: #2b2b2b; font-size: 16px;" data-preserver-spaces="true">Recall that the world&#8217;s largest asset manager splashed the waters in mid-June when it </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" style="font-size: 16px;" href="https://cryptopotato.com/blackrock-files-bitcoin-spot-etf-application-taps-coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">filed</span></a><span style="color: #2b2b2b; font-size: 16px;" data-preserver-spaces="true"> to introduce a spot BTC ETF in the US.

</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, the Commission initially considered the effort &#8220;inadequate,&#8221; forcing BlackRock to refile, naming Coinbase as a &#8220;surveillance partner.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Fink also joined the list of prominent individuals who think the asset class is akin to digital gold. More specifically, he claimed that people could distribute some of their wealth in BTC instead of in the precious metal as a hedge against inflation and protection against the devaluation of many national currencies.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Bitcoin is an international asset. It&#8217;s not based on anyone&#8217;s currency, and so it can represent an asset that people can play as an alternative,&#8221; he added.</span></p></blockquote>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">From a Critic to a Proponent</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Unlike his current view on the crypto industry, Fink was nowhere near that supportive of it in the past, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/13/blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-calls-bitcoin-an-index-of-money-laundering.html#close" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">calling</a> </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitcoin an &#8220;index of money laundering&#8221; in 2017:</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He opined in 2020 that the development of the digital asset sector could undermine the dominance of the US dollar as the world&#8217;s reserve currency. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Fink softened his stance last year, </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/former-crypto-sceptic-larry-fink-says-blackrock-is-studying-digital-assets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">revealing</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that BlackRock has started &#8220;studying digital currencies, stablecoins, and the underlying technologies to understand how they can help us serve our clients.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In his most recent interview for Fox Business, he explained that his initial backlash toward the industry was because &#8220;it was heavily used for, let&#8217;s say, illicit activities.&#8221;</span></p>
