Noting that the stock market is going up because President Joe Biden raised the debt ceiling, he emphasized that he still prefers gold, silver, and bitcoin.</strong></p>
<h2>Robert Kiyosaki’s Latest Economic Warnings</h2>
<p>The author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, is back with more warnings about the U.S. economy. Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries.</p>
<p>Kiyosaki slammed the Wall Street Journal in a tweet on Sunday for claiming that the U.S. economy is strong. He explained that the stock market is up because President Joe Biden signed into law the agreement to raise the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/treasury-secretary-yellen-insists-us-could-default-on-june-1-goldman-sachs-estimates-real-deadline-is-a-week-later/">debt ceiling</a>. Emphasizing that “America is broke,” he emphasized that he still prefers gold, silver, and bitcoin.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-600606 aligncenter" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/america-broke-tweet.jpg" alt="" width="927" height="311" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/america-broke-tweet-300x101.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/america-broke-tweet-768x258.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/america-broke-tweet.jpg 927w" sizes="(max-width: 927px) 100vw, 927px" /></p>
<p>On July 14, Kiyosaki similarly explained that the stock market is “taking off” because the U.S. government has “removed” the debt ceiling. He cautioned that it means the national debt will rise with the stock market.</p>
<p>The renowned author has repeatedly conveyed his belief that the Biden administration and the Federal Reserve are <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-warns-fed-rate-hikes-will-destroy-us-economy-says-invest-in-real-money-bitcoin/">destroying the U.S. economy</a> and the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/rich-dad-poor-dads-robert-kiyosaki-fed-treasury-destroying-dollar-advises-saving-bitcoin/">value of the U.S. dollar</a>.</p>

<p>Moreover, Kiyosaki predicted in June that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-warns-more-banks-are-about-to-fail/">more banks are about to fail</a>. He stated that regional banks in the U.S. are <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-says-regional-banks-are-being-wiped-out-calls-fed-criminal/">being wiped out</a> because of Fed policies.</p>
<p>This year has witnessed a series of bank failures in the U.S. Last week, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/another-us-bank-collapses-heartland-tri-state-bank-closed-by-regulator/">Heartland Tri-State Bank</a> collapsed. Prior to that, on March 10, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/first-citizens-bank-acquires-silicon-valley-bank-costing-fdic-deposit-insurance-fund-an-estimated-20b/">Silicon Valley Bank</a> was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, followed by the closure of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/signature-bank-closure-has-nothing-to-do-with-crypto-says-regulator/">Signature Bank</a> by the New York State Department of Financial Services on March 12. Additionally, on May 1, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-chase-assumes-control-of-first-republic-bank-following-seizure-by-california-regulators/">First Republic Bank</a> met a similar fate and was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation. Furthermore, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/silvergate-bank-announces-voluntary-liquidation-as-crypto-industry-woes-persist/">Silvergate Bank</a> made an announcement of voluntary liquidation.</p>

<h2>Ron DeSantis’ Promises on Bitcoin, Crypto, Central Bank Digital Currency</h2>
<p>Florida Governor and U.S. presidential candidate Ron DeSantis made several promises regarding bitcoin and cryptocurrency during his speech Monday at a campaign rally in New Hampshire.</p>
<p>“We are going to let Americans invest in things like bitcoin and cryptocurrency. No one&#8217;s forcing you to do it. If you want to do it you can do it,” DeSantis emphasized, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>Biden&#8217;s war on bitcoin and cryptocurrency will come to an end when I become president.</p></blockquote>
<p>DeSantis also reiterated his <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/done-dead-desantis-to-nix-central-bank-digital-currency-on-day-1/">promise</a> to stop the Fed from launching a central bank digital currency (CBDC). &#8220;We also will reject the Federal Reserve&#8217;s attempt to impose a central bank digital currency on the American people,” the presidential hopeful emphasized, elaborating:</p>
<blockquote><p>As president, on day one, CBDC goes into the trash can. We&#8217;re not going to allow it.</p></blockquote>

<p>Noting that the Fed wants to &#8220;go to a cashless society,&#8221; DeSantis opined: &#8220;They want to eliminate cryptocurrency and they want all the transactions to go through this central bank digital currency.&#8221; He noted that he recently signed legislation in Florida where &#8220;we don&#8217;t recognize central bank digital currency.&#8221; The Florida governor has repeatedly said that &#8220;CBDC is a<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/done-dead-desantis-to-nix-central-bank-digital-currency-on-day-1/"> massive threat to American liberty</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>DeSantis has also promised to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/florida-governor-ron-desantis-joins-us-presidential-race-promises-to-protect-bitcoin/">protect the right to use bitcoin</a>. He said in May: &#8220;You have every right to do bitcoin, the only reason bureaucrats in DC don&#8217;t like bitcoin is that they can&#8217;t control it. As president, we&#8217;ll protect your right to use bitcoin.&#8221;</p>

The document, prepared by BDO, a network of accounting and consulting services, found Tether has increased its reserves by $850 million during this period, with its overall excess reserves reaching $3.3 billion.</strong></p>&#13;
<h2>Tether Attestation Reveals Excess Reserves Reached $3.3 Billion in Q2</h2>&#13;
<p>Tether, the company that issues the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a> stablecoin, the largest of its kind in the cryptocurrency market, has released an attestation of its financial standings, revealing the composition of its reserves as of June 30.</p>&#13;
<p>The <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/vyse88cgwfbl/63oJePOHqIvrcnXWMPZ1M0/4cfaf2e7cdf80c30b17fdc70faaf741f/ESO.03.01_Std_ISAE_3000R_Opinion_30-06-2023_BDO_Tether_CRR.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">document</a>, prepared by BDO, an international network of accounting and consulting firms, determined that the company increased its reserves by $850 million in Q2. The document also found that Tether&#x2019;s excess reserves, defined as the &#x201C;company&#x2019;s own profits &#x2013; not distributed to shareholders and which the company has decided to keep on top of the 100% reserves that Tether maintains to back all the outstanding tokens,&#x201D; reached $3.3 billion.</p>&#13;
<p>According to Tether, the company&#x2019;s financial situation &#x201C;demonstrates the importance of taking the right risk management decisions and care for its community, keeping almost an additional 4% of assets within its reserves.&#x201D;</p>&#13;
&#13;
<h2>T-Bills and Other Investments</h2>&#13;
<p>The Tether consolidation reserves report also showed that the company has an exposure of almost $56 billion to U.S. Treasury bills with an average maturity of less than 90 days. Also, Tether has an indirect exposure to these treasuries via money market funds of $8.1 billion, while close to $9 billion are part of a group of treasuries given to Tether as collateral for reverse repurchase agreements.</p>&#13;
<p>Notably, the company also holds $1.67 billion in bitcoins and $5.5 billion in &#x201C;secured loans,&#x201D; defined by Tether as being &#x201C;over-collateralized by liquid assets subject to margin call and liquidation mechanisms.&#x201D;</p>&#13;
<p>Paolo Ardoino, CTO of Tether, praised the company&#x2019;s actions with this disclosure. In a press release, Ardoino <a href="https://tether.to/en/tether-excess-reserves-increase-by-850m-to-reach-3-3b-as-leading-stablecoin-reveals-72-5b-overall-exposure-in-us-t-bills-and-unveils-energy-related-investments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p>Transparency is not just a buzzword for us; it is the cornerstone of our philosophy.

This figure marks an estimated increase of $60.8 million from the previous month.</strong></p>
<h2>July&#8217;s Bitcoin Mining Landscape: Top Pools Capture 65.65% of Global Hashrate</h2>
<p>On July 31, 2023, the Bitcoin hashrate was smoothly navigating at a rate of 386.89 exahash per second (EH/s), with the past 2,016 blocks reflecting an average of approximately 377.7 EH/s. The month of July was marked by two pivotal <a href="https://btc.com/stats/diff">difficulty retargets</a>: the first of these adjustments occurred on July 11, increasing by 6.45% and elevating the total to 53.91 trillion.</p>
<p>Then, roughly two weeks later on July 26, or precisely 2,016 blocks subsequent to the previous change, the difficulty experienced a decrease of 2.94% at block height 800,352. This reduction has set the current difficulty level to 52.33 trillion, a figure that is expected to remain stable until on or around August 9, 2023.</p>
<p>Over the past month, bitcoin miners amassed $844.56 million through block rewards and fees, with fees alone constituting $18.81 million of this sum. This revenue marks a notable escalation, as it&#8217;s $60.8 million above the $783.76 million that miners garnered in June. The mining activity of July resulted in a total of <a href="https://archive.ph/YuvVG#selection-907.0-907.3">4,366 blocks</a>, with Foundry USA leading the way, discovering 1,266 blocks and thereby seizing 29% of the global hashrate.</p>
<p>Following closely, Antpool, the second-largest mining pool, discovered 992 blocks, while F2pool accounted for 608 blocks. Together, these mining pool juggernauts – Foundry, Antpool, and F2pool – have controlled a 65.65% share of the global hashrate over the last 30 days.</p>
<p>The scenario for bitcoin mining in January 2023 bears a resemblance to the present, with miners uncovering <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230131043339/https://btc.com/stats/pool?pool_mode=month">4,598 blocks</a> during that month. At the time, Foundry discovered 1,472 blocks, followed by Antpool&#8217;s successful find of 902 blocks. F2Pool trailed in third place, extracting approximately 663 blocks. Together, these powerhouses — Foundry, Antpool, and F2pool — controlled a substantial 66.05% share of the hashrate for January 2023.</p>
<p>Rewinding the clock almost seven years, the landscape was markedly different. From September 3 to October 3, 2016, mining was less consolidated, with <a href="https://archive.li/klL9n#selection-639.0-639.5">4,555 blocks</a> mined. During that period, the top three mining pools (F2pool, Antpool, and BTCC) only managed to capture 45.49% of the total hashrate, reflecting a more dispersed mining environment.</p>

At this time, the proposed FTX reorganization plan is targeting a comprehensive settlement between FTX and its creditors, encompassing both customers and associated FTX companies.</strong></p>
<h2>FTX Targets Recovery With Offshore Exchange Plan, New Trust Amid Bankruptcy</h2>
<p>On July 31, 2023, FTX&#8217;s current CEO, John J. Ray III, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ftx-debtors-file-initial-plan-of-reorganization-and-term-sheet-301889872.html">said</a> the team filed the reorganization plan early in the bankruptcy process to get feedback from creditors. FTX wants to work with creditors in the third quarter of 2023 to amend the plan and file a disclosure statement in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Ray thanked the FTX team for reaching this milestone amidst continuing efforts to maximize recoveries for customers and creditors. He also thanked the independent Board of Directors for providing governance and leadership during the bankruptcy process.</p>
<p>The proposed FTX reorganization plan shows that there&#8217;s deliberation about launching an “offshore exchange company.” If enacted, creditors could obtain equity or specific tokens that are associated with a newly launched offshore crypto exchange firm.</p>
<p>Debtors have the option of not going forward with an offshore exchange company plan if they believe it would delay the effectiveness of the bankruptcy proceedings. Debtors can object if there are “regulatory concerns” or the plan fails to “yield material incremental value to holders of Dotcom Customer Entitlements.”</p>
<p>As part of its bankruptcy reorganization plan, FTX is also considering setting up a new trust company called &#8220;FTX Ventures Trust.&#8221; This trust would hold FTX&#8217;s investments in private startup companies and digital tokens that FTX does not plan to sell right after exiting bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The purpose of the trust would be to manage these long-term investments and distribute cash from them over time. FTX has not yet decided if the trust would be owned by FTX&#8217;s bankrupt estate or traded separately after bankruptcy. The goal is to find a way to maximize the value of these illiquid investments that cannot be easily sold by FTX&#8217;s administrators after bankruptcy.</p>
<p>FTX&#8217;s native cryptocurrency, FTT, surged in value after the proposed plan was published on July 31, 2023, rising from $1.35 to a high of $1.52. However, its price fell back to $1.37 on Tuesday, August 1.</p>

<h2>Cascading Effect: Bitcoin&#x2019;s Fall Under $29K Sparks $92 Million in Liquidations</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
The crypto economy, along with a significant number of digital assets, faced a decline on the first day of August. The total value of the crypto market fell by 1.4% within the previous 24 hours, landing at $1.17 trillion as of Tuesday morning (11:00 a.m. Eastern Time).&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The day&#x2019;s largest losers included PLS and HEX, two tokens tied to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-files-lawsuit-against-richard-heart-and-companies-hex-pulsechain-and-pulsex/">Richard Heart&#x2019;s projects</a>. In addition, COMP, AAVE, SNX, GMX, and APE <a href="https://cryptobubbles.net/">sustained losses</a> ranging from 4.87% to 11.35% over the last day.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) dropped 1.61% against the US dollar, while ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) fell by 1.72%. With its network&#x2019;s impending halving event in less than 24 hours, litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>) managed to ward off losses and maintained a 0.73% increase as of 11 a.m. on Tuesday.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Nevertheless, like bitcoin and various other cryptocurrencies, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> prices slipped throughout the late hours on July 31. According to coinglass.com data, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> derivatives traders encountered $2.63 million in liquidations, with $1.88 million in long positions.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />

Overall, the global market cap was mostly in the red, dropping by 1.44% as of writing. Stellar fell to a one-week low, following a four-day losing streak of its own.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Solana (SOL)</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Solana slipped for a third consecutive session on Tuesday, as the token dropped to a one-week low.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
SOL/USD hit a bottom of $23.16 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, which comes a day after price peaked at $24.38.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Tuesday&#x2019;s low is the weakest point solana has hit since July 25, when the token traded under the $23.00 level.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
One of the catalysts of this decline appears to be the relative strength index (RSI) falling below a support point at 51.00&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 48.84, with the next visible price floor at 45.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
There is a strong chance that SOL bears could push the token towards $20.00, should bearish momentum intensify.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>Stellar (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XLM" 312015  target="_blank">XLM</a>)</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Stellar (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XLM" 312015  target="_blank">XLM</a>) was another notable token to drop on the first day of the new month, edging lower for a fourth straight day.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Following a high of $0.1558 to start the week, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XLM" 312015  target="_blank">XLM</a>/USD retreated to a low of $0.1465 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
This is the lowest point that stellar has hit since last Wednesday, and comes as bears made an attempt to collide with a floor at $0.1445.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Like with solana, today&#x2019;s sell-off in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XLM" 312015  target="_blank">XLM</a> was as a result of the RSI breaking out of a floor at the 59.00 zone.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Currently, price strength is tracking at 57.11, with the 10-day (red) moving average starting to point downward, following an extended uptrend.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
A destination of $0.1250 might be a long-term target, especially in the event of a breakout below $0.1445.&#13;<br />

<h2 dir="ltr">IRS Clarifies Cryptocurrency Staking Income, Leaves Questions Unanswered</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Under <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rr-23-14.pdf">fresh tax directives</a> from the IRS, staking rewards in cryptocurrency become taxable income within the United States immediately upon their acquisition by the taxpayer. The instant an owner is granted units of digital assets as incentives for validation, the fair market value of these rewards is to be incorporated into the taxpayer&#8217;s gross income during the taxable year in which the individual secures the staking rewards.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The fair market value is determined as of the date and time the taxpayer gains dominion and control over the validation rewards,” the IRS discloses. The revenue directive was penned by Alina Lewandowski of the Office of Associate Chief Counsel, and notably, the IRS&#8217;s guidance omits any mention of exceptions regarding the inclusion of staking rewards in gross income.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The IRS&#8217;s fresh tax rules regarding staking have ignited lively debates across social media platforms, with many contending that the ruling leaves gaps and unanswered questions. Tax specialist Jason Schwartz <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoTaxGuyETH/status/1686118864642281473?s=20">expressed</a> that the guidance prompts &#8220;several serious questions.&#8221; Specifically, the new IRS directives remain silent on issues such as slashing penalties and whether or not they may be counted as losses.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Additionally, the guidance conspicuously avoids discussing withholding for foreigners, leading Schwartz to <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoTaxGuyETH/status/1686119047518191616?s=20">pose the inquiry</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Does delegating to a U.S. node result in withholding for a foreigner?</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Schwartz <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoTaxGuyETH/status/1686119341194977280?s=20">delved into</a> the distinction between traditional staking and liquid staking, stating, “Most taxpayers take the view that U.S. tax law doesn&#8217;t ‘look through’ nonrebasing LSTs like rETH and wstETH.” He continued: “If they&#8217;re right, U.S. taxpayers who buy LSTs can turn current ordinary income into deferred capital gains. Is that the right policy result?” the tax expert inquired.</p>
<p>The latest revelation from the IRS coincides with a period when U.S. regulators are <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-argues-its-staking-services-are-not-securities-criticizes-sec-regulatory-approach/">intensifying</a> their efforts against staking services on a wide scale. Additionally, the IRS recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-judge-orders-kraken-to-release-customer-data-to-irs-in-cryptocurrency-tax-probe/">secured a victory</a> against Kraken, compelling the cryptocurrency exchange to furnish the tax agency with transaction details on accounts that engaged in trades worth $20,000 or more during the tax years spanning 2016 to 2020.</p>

Ethereum fell to a five-week low.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) slipped below the $29,000 level on Tuesday, as a result of a strengthening U.S. dollar.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Following a high of $29,463.87 to start the week, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD dropped to a bottom of $28,801.28 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
This is the lowest point that bitcoin has hit since June 21, when the price was at a low of $28,271.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Looking at the chart, today&#x2019;s move took place following a breakout of the 41.00 level on the relative strength index (RSI).&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As of writing, the index is tracking at 39.29, with the next visible point of support at the 35.00 zone.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Should it reach this level, there is a good chance that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> will be below $28,300.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) was also in the red to start the month, as the cryptocurrency dropped to a multi-week low.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD retreated to an intraday low of $1,818.41 on Tuesday, after Monday&#x2019;s peak at the $1,872.17 level.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As a result of this decline, ethereum fell for a third straight session, hitting its weakest point since June 28.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Similar to bitcoin, today&#x2019;s sell-off came as the RSI fell below a floor at 43.00. It is now at a reading of 41.96.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Overall, it appears that bears are targeting the $1,795 level, which was last hit on June 21.&#13;<br />

This comes shortly after similar investigations by Kenya&#8217;s Office of the Data Protection Commissioner (ODPC) and France&#8217;s National Commission for Informatics and Liberty (CNIL), who also announced probes into the Worldcoin project for like-minded apprehensions.</strong></p>
<h2>Three International Jurisdictions Investigate Worldcoin&#8217;s Data Collection Methods</h2>
<p>Various jurisdictions&#8217; data regulators are diligently examining Worldcoin, a digital currency venture that utilizes iris-scanning biometric technology. The project&#8217;s native cryptocurrency, worldcoin (WLD), <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/examining-worldcoins-concentrated-supply-at-token-launch/">premiered</a> last week. According to Openai CEO Sam Altman, a co-founder of Worldcoin, individuals signed up at a significant pace of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/worldcoin-adoption-said-to-be-accelerating-sam-altman-states-one-person-getting-verified-every-8-seconds/">every eight seconds</a> on July 26, 2023. Nonetheless, by week&#8217;s end, France&#8217;s oversight agency, the National Commission on Informatics and Liberty (CNIL), <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-french-privacy-regulator-probes-worldcoins-biometric-data-practices/">raised concerns</a> about Worldcoin&#8217;s data-gathering methods.</p>
<p>“The legality of this [data] collection seems questionable,” CNIL remarked to Reuters the previous week.</p>

<p>Subsequent to the French report, Kenya&#8217;s foremost data authority, the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner (ODPC), <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/kenyan-data-regulator-issues-warning-as-residents-rush-to-get-worldcoins-free-money/">echoed similar misgivings</a> about Worldcoin&#8217;s practices. Presently, Bavaria&#8217;s State Office for Data Protection Supervision (DPS) has joined the ranks of worried entities, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/german-data-watchdog-probing-worldcoin-crypto-project-official-says-2023-07-31/">declaring</a> an investigation into Worldcoin as described in a Reuters article released on Monday. Bavaria&#8217;s DPS pointed out that it has examined Worldcoin since November 2022 due to its processing of &#8220;sensitive data at a very large scale.”</p>
<p>&#8220;These technologies are at first sight neither established nor well analysed for the specific core purpose of the processing in the field of transferring financial information,&#8221; Michael Will, the state regulator&#8217;s president, explained to Reuters through email correspondence.</p>
<p>The news organization contacted the Worldcoin Foundation but had not yet obtained a response regarding the issue. Upon reporting on the French data regulator, the Worldcoin Foundation claimed to have a “robust privacy program.” Moreover, the foundation indicated that it was cooperating with regulators in all jurisdictions, including Bavarian authorities. Currently, the Worldcoin project is operating <a href="https://dataconomy.com/2023/07/31/here-are-all-of-the-worldcoin-orb-locations/">119 Orbs in 18 different countries</a> around the world and has been expanding since it launched.</p>
