<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Vivek Ramaswamy, the second US Presidential candidate to officially accept Bitcoin donations for the 2024 elections.</em></li>



<li><em>Eligible US citizens can donate up to $6,600. Donors will receive a non-fungible token (NFT) as a reward.</em></li>



<li><em>In February, lawmakers in Kansas introduced a bill proposing a cap of $100 for crypto political donations, subject to certain conditions.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Vivek Ramaswamy recently made headlines when he became the second Presidential candidate in the United States to accept Bitcoin donations for the upcoming 2024 elections. </strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/FwmQnhsWYAEIHxv.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/FwmQnhsWYAEIHxv-1024x768.jpg" alt="Vivek Ramaswamy Paves The Way for Bitcoin In US Politics!" class="wp-image-188799" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/FwmQnhsWYAEIHxv-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/FwmQnhsWYAEIHxv-300x225.jpg 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/FwmQnhsWYAEIHxv-768x576.jpg 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/FwmQnhsWYAEIHxv-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/FwmQnhsWYAEIHxv-750x563.jpg 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/FwmQnhsWYAEIHxv-1140x855.jpg 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/FwmQnhsWYAEIHxv.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Breaking News: Vivek Ramaswamy Paves The Way For Bitcoin In US Politics! 2"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In a public statement, he urged supporters to donate just $1 towards his campaign, indicating that he was accepting Bitcoin donations. Ramaswamy&#8217;s revelation came just two days after Robert F. Kennedy Jr. became the first presidential candidate in United States history to accept campaign donations in Bitcoin.</p>



<p>Ramaswamy&#8217;s decision to accept Bitcoin donations is significant, as it reflects a growing interest in cryptocurrency and a desire to make the 2024 election a referendum on fiat currency. During his announcement, Ramaswamy even flashed a QR code while on stage, which when scanned, would redirect users to a payment gateway that offers various payment options for donations, including BTC and Satoshi (sats) — the smallest denomination of Bitcoin.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just announced we’re officially accepting <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#Bitcoin</a> donations. <br>Give $1. <br>Let’s make the 2024 election a referendum on fiat currency. <a href="https://t.co/KrHJdomtCh" target="_blank">https://t.co/KrHJdomtCh</a> <a href="https://t.co/OkVmoBmTFz" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/OkVmoBmTFz</a></p>&mdash; Vivek Ramaswamy (@VivekGRamaswamy) <a href="https://twitter.com/VivekGRamaswamy/status/1660016950632652801?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 20, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that eligible U.S. citizens and permanent residents can donate up to $6,600 for the campaign, which is not deductible as charitable contributions for federal income tax purposes. In addition, donors will be awarded with a non-fungible token (NFT) as the donation page mentions, &#8220;After donating, come back to claim your NFT.&#8221; This is a unique way to reward supporters and create a sense of community around the campaign.</p>



<p>Interestingly, lawmakers in the Kansas House of Representatives recently introduced a bill proposing a cap of $100 when it comes to crypto political donations. If this bill were to pass, any donations under $100 would need to be immediately converted to U.S. dollars, not used for expenditures, and not held onto by the receiver.</p>



<p>Ramaswamy&#8217;s decision to accept Bitcoin donations is a bold move that reflects a changing political landscape. It will be interesting to see how other candidates respond to this move and whether it will have any impact on the outcome of the 2024 election.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Turkcorp, a major hedge fund and management company, has announced the opening of a new cryptocurrency exchange in Ankara, Turkey.</em></li>



<li><em>Turkex, the new exchange, will provide a dependable and secure platform for buying and selling a range of cryptocurrencies at the lowest feasible costs.</em></li>



<li><em>The exchange is slated to be live in the coming weeks, and early adopters may signal their interest by registering early.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Hedge fund Turkcorp <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/05/20/2672869/0/en/TURKCORP-launches-new-crypto-exchange-Turkex-to-give-investors-more-options-across-the-MENA-area.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that it would launch a new cryptocurrency exchange Turkex in Ankara, Turkey.</strong></h5>

<p>In addition to offering crypto trading, the new exchange also supports real-time market data, charting tools, and multiple order execution methods. The crypto exchange will launch in the next few weeks, and early adopters can sign up early.</p>



<p>Turkex&#8217;s debut comes as demand for cryptocurrency trading in the area grows and conventional investment channels such as equities and real estate undergo a decline.</p>



<p>Türküm&#8217;s founder, who is thought to be worth $40 million, stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Turkcorp is excited to be at the forefront of this rapidly evolving industry that can rightfully be termed as the future of finance. We have been consulting with clients for a while now and, after conducting our due diligence, have designed the exchange to meet the needs of both novice and experienced traders. We believe this will provide a much-needed platform for secure cryptocurrency trading in Turkey, Europe, and the MENA region.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Turkcorp&#8217;s expertise in finance and technology will be used to provide a trader-focused platform that helps them by providing strong liquidity, fair trade pricing, and minimal trading costs.</p>



<p>The corporation has already committed considerable amounts to the new exchange&#8217;s development and marketing. To build a world-class trading experience, they have employed elite professionals that understand UI and UX.</p>



<p>Turkey is also one of the nations that want to boost its economy using anti-inflationary methods such as cryptocurrency. According to GWI Research, Turkey saw the biggest rise in crypto ownership, with 27.1% from July-September 2021 to July-September 2022.</p>

<p>An attacker successfully gave 1.2 million votes to a fraudulent proposal on May 20 at 3:25 ET. Assuming that the proposition garnered over 700,000 valid votes, the attacker gained complete control over Tornado Cash.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">On 2023/05/20 at 07:25:11 UTC, Tornado Cash governance effectively ceased to exist. Through a malicious proposal, an attacker granted themselves 1,200,000 votes. As this is more than the ~700,000 legitimate votes, they now have full control.<a href="https://t.co/nY87XmrYgT" target="_blank">https://t.co/nY87XmrYgT</a> <a href="https://t.co/h9qjc3xRqz" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/h9qjc3xRqz</a></p>&mdash; @samczsun.com (@samczsun) <a href="https://twitter.com/samczsun/status/1660012956632104960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 20, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The information was given by @samczsun of research-driven technology investment company Paradigm, who disclosed that while presenting the fraudulent proposal, the attacker claimed that it employed reasoning similar to a proposal previously approved by the community. This time, though, the suggestion had an extra purpose.</p>



<p>As @samczsun describes, this malicious recommendation is identical to prior regular ideas, except for the addition of a distinct line of code-named emergencyStop. After the proposal has been accepted by the voters, the attackers will use this emergencyStop function, which will result in a fresh logic update for the proposal that creates additional bogus votes.</p>



<p>With complete control over Tornado Cash governance, the attacker may remove all locked votes, drain all tokens in the governance contract, and brick the router. According to @samczsun, the attacker simply sold it 10,000 votes as TORN all at the time of writing.</p>



<p>The Tornado Cash attacker got 483,000 TORn from the Tornado Cash governance vault and 6,000 TORN into Bitrue before selling 379,300 TORN on the network for 375 ETH. There are 97,700 TORNs that have yet to be sold or transferred.</p>



<p>The hack serves as a caution to cryptocurrency investors to thoroughly review proposal descriptions and arguments. Tornado Cash&#8217;s active community member, Tornadosaurus-Hex or Mr. Tornadosaurus Hex, acknowledged that all money in governance is possibly compromised and asked that all members remove any funds held in Governance.</p>



<p>The team is presently looking for Solidity developers who can assist in saving the protocol from extinction. They also indicated that they need interaction with Binance, which has more tokens than the attacker.</p>



<p>Binance said that it would temporarily cease accepting TORN deposits owing to a governance assault on the Tornado Cash protocol.</p>

<p>VRF offers an easy-to-use subscription management software for gaining access to a safe source of randomness, enabling smart contract writers to create the next generation of provably fair and scalable NFT and gaming apps.</p>



<p>This will provide developers with access to a well-known random number generator (RNG). On May 22, the Arbitrum Foundation and Chainlink will offer a VRF workshop.</p>



<p>According to the official press release, Chainlink VRF has joined the Arbitrum One platform. Arbitrum and Chainlink will gain from the launch since it will provide them access to new decentralized apps (dApps) and smart contracts created by developers.</p>



<p>Chainlink VRF continues to be the most widely used RNG (random number generator) in the cryptocurrency sector. It enables smart contract developers to create scalable, fair, and secure applications like as gambling and NFT. Moreover, Arbitrum One allows developers to create dApps at a cheap cost and with great throughput.</p>



<p>Johann Eid of Chainlink Labs remarked on Arbitrum&#8217;s merits in relieving Ethereum transaction congestion while maintaining security. He thinks that by improving VRF, Arbitrum&#8217;s remarkable speed will enable many new use cases.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Ethereum Layer 2s like Arbitrum play a fundamental role in offloading transaction congestion from Ethereum without sacrificing the security needed to ensure the healthy growth of the blockchain industry. We&#8217;re excited about the use cases that can now be unlocked by optimizing Chainlink VRF to benefit from the incredible speed enabled by Arbitrum.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Arbitrum One&#8217;s Chainlink VRF is a win-win scenario for both the Arbitrum and Chainlink communities. The VRF has completed over 15.8 million request transactions and is now providing verified randomization to over 6,300 distinct smart contracts across different blockchains.</p>



<p>Chainlink and Arbitrum have joined to assist developers in creating complex DApps that trigger crucial smart contract functionality. Arbitrum One&#8217;s Chainlink Automation automates important smart contract tasks in a decentralized way.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Ben.eth might face charges of deceiving investors, racketeering, fraud, and wire fraud, according to the letter. The PSYOP presale garnered more than $7 million, and the lawyer seeks $21 million in damages if the class action case is launched. In a settlement, Kanovitz has requested that investors get ETH.</p>



<p>Ben.eth has identified media celebrity Andrew Tate as a prospective buyer for the PSYOP meme currency. Earlier, YouTuber Ben &#8220;Bitboy&#8221; Armstrong was connected to the BEN meme currency after purchasing and then selling all of his token holdings.</p>



<p>Others are claiming to be suing Ben.eth and have shown interest in joining the current class action lawsuit. Ben.eth, on the other hand, makes jokes about the lawsuit and concentrates on airdrops.</p>

<p>After the success of his initial meme currency launch, BEN, investors were anxious to join in on ben.eth&#8217;s next meme coin initiative.</p>



<p>BEN rewarded its early investors with a more than 5,000% one-day rise on May 8th, triggered by an endorsement from crypto influencer Ben Armstrong, who finally took over the project from ben.eth for an unknown sum.</p>



<p>Despite Ben.eth&#8217;s presale raising some severe red flags, the success of the unconventional PSYOP presale demonstrates increased investor zeal to get in early on what may be the next trendy meme currency.</p>



<p>On-chain investigator ZachXBT has also released evidence of deceiving investors and raising 10,000 ETH via the PSYOP presale. ZachXBT has been revealing various meme currencies as individuals are being tricked into trading throughout the memecoin season.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>OKX announced the listing of Orders (ORDI) on its spot trading markets.</em></li>



<li><em>ORDI deposits on the exchange will be available on May 20, 2023, at 7:00 a.m. UTC.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ordinals (ORDI), a meme token on the BRC-20 network, has been <a href="https://www.okx.com/help-center/okx-will-list-ordinals-ordi-for-spot-trading" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added</a> to <a href="https://news.coincu.com/187859-okx-wallet-brc-20-trading/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OKX</a>&#8216;s spot trading platforms.</strong></h5>

<p>Ordinals is a system that enables users to generate records using text, photos, audio, and video on Bitcoin&#8217;s smallest unit, the satoshi. In the Bitcoin network, these data may be utilized to generate NFTs and tokens.</p>



<p>According to the OKX statement, ORDI deposits will be available on May 20, 2023 at 7:00 a.m. UTC. Spot trading for the ORDI/USDT pair will commence if the ORDI token investment satisfies the exchange&#8217;s standards. The total supply and circulating supply of ORDI are both 21 million, which corresponds to the maximum amount of Bitcoins.</p>



<p>OKX CEO Star also tweeted on the ORDI listing, stating that the OKX exchange would soon list ORDI and start deposits and withdrawals. He also said that the BRC-20 token wallet and marketplace would be available on the web3 wallet starting next week.</p>



<p>Ordinals is a meme token in the BRC-20 network, a layer-2 Bitcoin solution that allows smart contracts and decentralized apps. Many BTC advocates, however, say that they choke the BTC network and are worthless.</p>

<p>In a short amount of time, a considerable number of BRC-20 tokens have been created, many of which are meme tokens. Also, the Dogecoin network has a similar arrangement dubbed DRC-20, which has helped the DOGE network to shatter records in terms of transaction volume.</p>



<p>Yesterday, the crypto exchange Gate.io also <a href="https://news.coincu.com/188705-gateio-ordi-withdrawal-high-fees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the availability of ORDI withdrawals, but the community objected since the transaction cost was too expensive. On May 19, the exchange allowed the BRC-20 ORDI Token withdrawal, although it was widely criticized by the community since the withdrawal cost was as high as 65 ORDI, which Gate subsequently decreased to 5.58 ORDI.</p>

<li><em>Their collaboration is a deliberate choice that will allow them to harness their combined experience.</em></li>



<li><em>The goal is to democratize access to Web3 products.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>UniPass, a non-custodial crypto smart contract wallet, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/account-labs-emerges-from-unipass-and-keystone-merger-forging-ahead-in-web3-account-abstraction-301829206.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> in its press release that it would combine with cryptocurrency hardware wallet Keystone to become Account Labs.</strong></h5>

<p>Keystone founder Liu Lixin will be named CEO of Account Labs, while Unipass founder Zhi Xian will be named COO (COO). Account Labs will concentrate on creating and exploring account abstraction (AA) solutions in the future.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We are on the cusp of a Web3 Account Abstraction revolution. Together, we&#8217;ll drive rapid transformation, making the transition from Web2 to Web3 effortless for users. Our goal is to ensure everyone can securely and smoothly manage a decentralized account. We welcome partners to join us in advancing the Web3 account domain,&#8221; said Xian.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Account Labs combines UniPass and Keystone&#8217;s vast expertise in cryptography research, software engineering, product design, and security protection. Their collaborative efforts will center on identifying synergies in the Account abstraction industry and fostering technical innovation. </p>



<p>The mission is to provide next-generation Web3 Account Abstraction solutions that make decentralized account ownership and administration a seamless experience for consumers, ultimately boosting blockchain technology adoption.</p>



<p>The original investors in Keystone and UniPass have also expressed significant support for this combination. Amber Group, Atom Capital, BAI Capital, BODL Ventures, DWEB3 Capital, Folius Ventures, Galxe, HashGlobal, HashKey Capital, Jerry Huang, Mable Jiang, Mask Network, MixMarvel DAO Ventures, NGC Ventures, Permanent Ventures, Qiming Ventures, SNZ Holding, Xinjun Liang, and Youbi Capital are among them.</p>



<p>According to Unipass, most current crypto wallets function as an &#8216;Externally-Owned Account&#8217; (EOA), yet if a user loses a private key or seed phrase, permanent asset loss is unavoidable.</p>



<p>Account abstraction, on the other hand, may more effectively enlarge the programming space of Web3 accounts. It is the same as Ethereum if EOA is Bitcoin. As a result, account abstraction, which is novel to the blockchain industry, revolutionizes the way Web3 accounts interact. It&#8217;s a novel approach to attracting people.</p>



<p>Account abstraction, a concept initially proposed by Ethereum inventor Vitalik Buterin in 2015, solves the usability and security issues associated with decentralized accounts. With this acquisition, Account Labs will be the sole industry player working at the convergence of usability and security.</p>



<p>UniPass&#8217; renowned technological techniques have received recognition and application across a wide range of applications, successfully facilitating access for Web3 users. They develop a full decentralized account ecosystem by using complex cryptographic technologies like zero-knowledge proofs and DKIM protocols.</p>

<li><em>Éric Larchevêque, co-founder of Ledger and CEO from 2014 to 2019, went on to convey his thoughts on the wallet&#8217;s new function.</em></li>



<li><em>Last week, the controversial crypto business was chastised for introducing a service that allowed them authority over seed phrase storage.</em></li>



<li><em>To him, the whole collapse is a huge public relations disaster, not a technical one.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The crypto community reacted angrily to the debut of Ledger Recover, a service that lets users of the hardware wallet back up their secret recovery phrases.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-994.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-994-1024x683.png" alt="Former Ledger CEO Says New Function Is A PR Failure" class="wp-image-188748" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-994-1024x683.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-994-300x200.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-994-768x512.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-994-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-994-2048x1365.png 2048w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-994-750x500.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-994-1140x760.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Former Ledger CEO Says New Function Is A PR Failure 26"></a></figure></div>


<p>Ledger co-founder and former CEO Éric Larchevêque, who worked at the company<em> </em>from 2014 to 2019, saw the criticism directed at the wallet as a pure PR failure, not a technological one.</p>



<p>A company upgrade included a subscription-based function named &#8220;Recover.&#8221; In addition, the problematic feature gave the firm access to client seed phrases and required Verification credentials. This contradicts Ledger&#8217;s core reason d&#8217;être, which is privacy and security.</p>



<p>Larchevêque <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/13ldgcl/my_personal_view_on_the_pr_disaster_from_a_ledger/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“I’m devastated to come on this subreddit, that I created nine years ago, to see images of Ledger devices burning, insults and lot and lot of anger. I’m honestly to the verge of tears.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>His first action as a co-founder was to apologize for how the launch was handled. He did, however, defend the technique, stating:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“To me, all this meltdown is a total PR failure, but absolutely not a technical one.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He said that the Recover update has no effect on the security concept of the hardware wallet. He went on to say:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“My mistake as a CEO during my tenure was probably not be relentless enough about explaining the security model, but at some point you just give up as people don&#8217;t care at all. Until they care again, like now.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The ex-CEO claimed that the only thing that had changed was the general user&#8217;s perception of trustlessness and that the firmware&#8217;s Recover code was not malicious:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Ledger is still safe, there is no backdoor, the Ledger Recover is not a conspiracy, no one will ever force anyone to use Recover.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to him, the FUD and controversy that erupted in the aftermath of the update did not help things. The security model is the same as it was before customers were aware of Ledger Recover. Trusting Ledger by sharding the seed phrase is analogous to trusting the wallet with transaction signing, according to Larchevêque. In response to a user&#8217;s suggestion to have two distinct firmware versions to eliminate backdoor issues, he said that it wouldn&#8217;t alter anything and would be disappointing for him personally.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not the first time <a href="https://news.coincu.com/188438-ledger-defends-its-stand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ledger</a> has been involved in a contentious public relations debacle. That is also not the first time that corporate leaders have defended their products at the cost of their consumers.</p>



<p>It was chastised in April for advertising a necklace as part of the Ledger Nano X OnChain crypto wallet. The company entirely ignored the fact that wearing a hardware wallet around your neck violates every security standard in the book.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Strike has announced that it is now accessible for download to over 3 billion people globally, with dozens of additional nations added.</em></li>



<li><em>The company&#8217;s CEO, Jack Mallers, made the news on Friday at the Bitcoin 2023 conference in Miami Beach, Florida.</em></li>



<li><em>Mallers said that the decision to shift its headquarters to El Salvador was made in reaction to rising anti-crypto regulatory attitudes in the United States.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Strike, a Bitcoin payment company founded in Chicago, has <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230519005354/en/Strike-launches-global-money-app-to-3-billion-people-in-over-65-countries" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extended</a> its services to 65 countries while also shifting its worldwide headquarters to El Salvador.</strong></h5>

<p>Wallet users in India, South Korea, Sri Lanka, and other countries will be able to send payments to one another in both USD and BTC as a result of the worldwide expansion.</p>



<p>Bhutan, Brazil, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Kenya, New Zealand, Paraguay, and Uganda were among the 47 supported nations mentioned during Mallers&#8217; presentation, in addition to previously announced additions such as Argentina, Nigeria, Kenya, and Ghana. Formerly, the mobile app was only available in the United States, El Salvador, and Argentina.</p>



<p>The growth effort, according to Jack Mallers, CEO and founder of Zap, Strike&#8217;s parent company, intends to confront the clouded world of crypto exchanges and secret, unregistered licensing regimes and 1,000 distinct currencies. Mallers said to <em><a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/05/19/strike-expands-bitcoin-payments-to-65-countries-moves-global-headquarters-to-el-salvador/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortune</a></em> the decision to shift its offices to El Salvador was made in reaction to rising anti-crypto regulatory attitudes in the United States.</p>



<p>On the one hand, rules preclude Strike from operating in New York. El Salvador, on the other hand, enacted crypto-inclusive rules in order to promote technology innovation in the area.</p>



<p>At a time when the US crypto sector is facing legal uncertainty, and the Securities and Exchange Commission is prosecuting businesses for issuing unregistered securities, Mallers says Strike&#8217;s Bitcoin-first strategy is validated.</p>



<p>Mallers highlighted at Bitcoin 2023 in Miami that the company&#8217;s growth efforts were largely aimed at individuals who required improved payment methods and technology the most.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“It’s a lot of the global south. The global south has a lot to do with Bitcoin – they have a lot to say for where the world is going.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to the corporation, the expansion will extend its entire addressable market to over 3 billion people.</p>



<p>The Strike app offers worldwide payment and cross-border money transfer services using Bitcoin and Lightning, a secondary network enabling cheaper and quicker Bitcoin transactions. The program now has a fresh new user experience and allows users to save money in Bitcoin (BTC) and Tether (USDT).</p>
