Binance Australia said while it works to find an alternative, users can still &#8220;buy and sell crypto using credit or debit cards.&#8221; Scott Collary, an executive at the service provider, claimed that &#8220;scammers are increasingly using overseas exchanges.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Binance Australia Seeks an Alternative Third-Party Payment Service Provider</h2>
<p>Crypto exchange Binance Australia announced on May 18 that it had &#8220;temporarily&#8221; suspended Australian dollar services after its payment service provider Westpac abruptly discontinued support for the platform. As a consequence, the crypto exchange said it is now &#8220;unable to facilitate PayID AUD deposits for Binance users.&#8221; The exchange warned users that the action taken by the third-party payment service will also likely impact bank transfer withdrawals.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fellow Binancians,</p>
<p>We regret to inform you that with immediate effect we are unable to facilitate PayID AUD deposits for Binance users due to a decision made by our third party payment service provider. We understand from our third party payment service provider that Bank…</p>
<p>&mdash; Binance Australia (@Binance_AUS) <a href="https://twitter.com/Binance_AUS/status/1659018600496373760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 18, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>However, in its May 18 <a href="https://twitter.com/Binance_AUS/status/1659018600496373760">tweet</a>, Binance Australia did not explain why it has been banned or offer a hint of when the temporary suspension of the service is likely to be lifted. Instead, the tweet said the crypto exchange is working to find an alternative. The tweet also advised Binance Australia users to switch to its peer-to-peer marketplace.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are working hard to find an alternative provider to continue offering AUD deposits and withdrawals to our users. Notably, you can still buy and sell crypto using credit or debit cards and our Binance P2P marketplace will also continue to operate as usual. Rest assured that your funds are safe through the Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU), an insurance fund that offers protection to Binance users and their funds in the event of extreme situations,&#8221; the crypto exchange said in a tweet.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h2>Crypto Exchanges Failing to Deal With Scammers</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, reports from local media have said Binance Australia was among several other crypto exchanges that have been cut off by Westpac, which announced a series of so-called scam protection measures on the same day. Explaining why his firm made the drastic decision of banning crypto exchanges, Scott Collary, the group executive of customer services and technology at Westpac, <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/world-s-biggest-crypto-exchange-halts-withdrawals-for-australian-users-20230518-p5d9g1.html">reportedly</a> said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Digital exchanges have a legitimate role to play in the financial ecosystem. But since the rise of digital currency, we’ve noticed that scammers are increasingly using overseas exchanges.</p></blockquote>
<p>Collary also claimed that customers of Westpac usually discover they have been scammed when the funds have already left the country. At that point, recovering the stolen funds will be &#8220;extremely difficult.&#8221;</p>
<p>While an unnamed spokesperson for Australian Payments Plus, which oversees the operation of Pay ID, is quoted confirming the decision, they nonetheless denied any involvement in the matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a matter for this organisation and its third-party payment service provider,&#8221; the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Westpac’s decision to ban Binance Australia is the latest in a series of setbacks to befall the crypto exchange in Australia. In early April, a <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/binance-loses-australian-financial-services-licence-after-asic-warning-20230406-p5cyq2.html">report</a> in the Sydney Morning Herald said the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) had canceled the license of Binance Australia’s local entity known as Oztures Trading. The report added that the Australian watchdog had been conducting &#8220;a targeted review&#8221; of the crypto exchange’s financial services business in the country.</p>

<h2>Pilot Program for e-HKD Begins</h2>
<p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced Thursday “the commencement of the e-HKD Pilot Programme.” The central banking institution revealed that 16 firms from the financial, payment, and technology sectors have been selected to participate in the first round of e-HKD pilots for 2023. The HKMA detailed:</p>
<blockquote><p>The pilots will take deep dives into potential use cases in six categories, including full-fledged payments, programmable payments, offline payments, tokenized deposits, settlement of Web3 transactions, and settlement of tokenized assets.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The HKMA will conduct a series of pilots in close collaboration with various stakeholders to examine the use cases, as well as implementation and design issues relating to e-HKD,” the monetary authority described, adding that it aims to share key learnings with the public at Hong Kong Fintech Week 2023 in November.</p>
<p>The companies participating in the pilot program include Alipay Financial Services, Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Fubon Bank, Ripple Labs, Standard Chartered Bank, Hang Seng Bank, HSBC, Visa, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Mastercard Asia/Pacific, and Boston Consulting Group.</p>
<p>Eddie Yue, HKMA&#8217;s chief executive, commented: “While the HKMA has not yet made a decision on whether and when to introduce e-HKD, we are excited to kick-start the e-HKD Pilot Programme, which serves as a tremendous opportunity for the HKMA to collaborate with the industry in exploring innovative use cases and maximizing our readiness for a potential e-HKD.”</p>

<p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority published its policy stance on e-HKD in September last year as part of its &#8220;Fintech 2025&#8221; strategy. Two rounds of market consultation were conducted: one on high-level technical design and one on key policy and design issues. A total of 75 responses were received during the consultation period.</p>
<p>The HKMA explained at the time that it will adopt a three-rail approach. Rail 1 establishes the technological and legal foundations for the e-HKD, Rail 2 explores use cases and conducts pilots, and Rail 3 focuses on launching e-HKD based on the outcomes of the previous phases.</p>
<p>“The e-HKD Pilot Programme is a key component of Rail 2 under the HKMA’s three-rail approach in paving the way for the possible implementation of a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC), i.e. e-HKD, in the future,” the HKMA noted in Thursday&#8217;s announcement.</p>

<h2>Venezuela Shifting Away From USD in Trade</h2>
<p>The president of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, said on his weekly “Con Maduro +” program earlier this week that Venezuela will shift away from using the U.S. dollar in trade. Commending <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/imf-says-zimbabwe-gold-backed-digital-currency-a-potential-threat-to-financial-stability/">Zimbabwe</a> for its initiative to issue gold-backed digital currency, he said (as translated from Spanish by Google):</p>
<blockquote><p>Many alternative initiatives to the dollar are emerging in the world. We could say that we are beginning to experience a sustained accelerated process of de-dollarization of the commercial world — of world trade.</p></blockquote>
<p>He added that it would be good for Venezuela to study these initiatives, emphasizing that the process of de-dollarization globally is &#8220;inevitable.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Venezuelan president, who previously expressed support for Latin America to have one <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/venezuelan-president-nicolas-maduro-signals-support-for-single-currency-in-latam-calls-for-crypto-inclusion/">single currency</a>, proceeded to describe that as the world moves &#8220;further toward equilibrium,&#8221; becoming &#8220;more multipolar&#8221; and &#8220;more pluricentric,&#8221; &#8220;a basket of currencies will appear for trade, for financial functioning.”</p>
<p>He then condemned “the political use” of the dollar as the world’s reserve currency and its associated financial system by the U.S. to sanction countries, naming China, Russia, India, Iran, Turkey, Venezuela, and Cuba in particular. Maduro opined:</p>
<blockquote><p>The world comes to a point where it gets tired, and also new economic powers are emerging … There could be a basket of currencies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maduro then highlighted Zimbabwe&#8217;s gold-backed digital currency initiative as a step towards &#8220;necessary and fair&#8221; de-dollarization efforts. He also mentioned de-dollarization initiatives by the BRICS economic bloc, mentioning the group&#8217;s New Development Bank (NDB). The BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) are also working to create a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-nations-working-on-creating-new-currency-to-be-discussed-at-next-leaders-summit/">common currency</a> that will help them reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar.</p>

<p>Noting that the BRICS leaders plan to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-leaders-set-to-discuss-common-currency-to-challenge-us-dollar-dominance-in-upcoming-summit/">discuss</a> a proposal for a common BRICS currency at their upcoming leaders’ summit in August, Maduro stressed that if a BRICS currency emerges, a new world is &#8220;necessary.&#8221; He emphasized that Venezuela needs to position itself for the new world, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is the path of Venezuela and the path of a free economy where currencies are not used to punish countries and impose sanctions.</p></blockquote>
<p>The official Twitter account for Maduro also tweeted Wednesday: &#8220;The de-dollarization of world trade is inevitable, we are living it. Gone will be the old world of criminal sanctions and economic manipulations, with the interest of punishing the people. The rebirth of a new world is today, where freedom, justice, and respect prevail!&#8221;</p>
<p>A growing number of countries other than the BRICS nations are pushing to use local currencies instead of the USD. Ten Southeast Asian countries, members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/10-southeast-asian-nations-challenge-dollar-dominance-with-push-for-local-currencies/">agreed</a> to “encourage the use of local currencies for economic and financial transactions.” Multiple people have warned that a successful BRICS currency will erode the U.S. dollar&#8217;s dominance, including a former <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-currency-will-erode-us-dollars-dominance-former-white-house-economist-warns/">White House economist</a>.</p>

While smaller than in the United States, the impact of the monetary policy tightening on the Old Continent is likely to grow further, the regulator expects.</strong></p>
<h2>Housing Investment in Europe Declining Amid ECB’s Rate Increases</h2>
<p>The series of rate hikes announced by the European Central Bank (ECB) is already depressing housing spending across the eurozone, the monetary authority has established in a <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/economic-bulletin/focus/2023/html/ecb.ebbox202303_01~97644cdc95.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a>, the results of which were published on its website on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The findings come after in early May the ECB <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ecb-raises-interest-rates-by-25bps-amid-too-high-inflation-no-pause-lagarde-says/">raised</a> its key interest rates by 25 basis points (bps), slowing the pace from previous increases. The bank has raised them by a total of 375 bps since last July, Reuters noted in a report.</p>
<p>The impact of the rate hikes on home purchases in Europe is likely to increase in the future, although it will remain smaller than that in the United States, according to the research, which also covers the American housing market.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-588742 size-full" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/euus.jpg" alt="Rate Hikes Affecting Housing Markets in Eurozone, United States, ECB Study Shows" width="744" height="382" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/euus-300x154.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/euus.jpg 744w" sizes="(max-width: 744px) 100vw, 744px" /></p>
<p>“While housing investment is one of the most interest rate-sensitive components of economic activity, it is generally much less volatile in the euro area than in the United States,” the ECB commented in an economic bulletin article presenting the study.</p>
<p>The European regulator estimates that “a temporary monetary policy shock that increases the short-term interest rate by 1 percentage point on impact leads, all else being equal, to a decline in housing investment in the euro area of around 5% after about three years … However, in the United States, the same shock has a greater impact on housing investment, leading to a drop of around 8%.”</p>

<p>Housing investment in the euro zone began to decline in the second quarter of 2022 and fell by a cumulative 4% by the end of the year. The decline in the U.S. started in Q2 of 2021 and since then housing spending has dropped by around 21%.</p>
<p>On May 3, the U.S. Federal Reserve <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-reserve-raises-interest-rate-by-25bps-insists-us-banking-system-is-sound-and-resilient/">increased</a> interest rates by 25 bps, stating that some additional raises may be appropriate to return inflation to 2%. Following the latest rate hike in Europe, ECB officials, including President Christine Lagarde and most recently Vice President Luis de Guindos, have indicated that amid stubborn inflation it’s still early for a pause in the tightening in the eurozone as well.</p>

The cryptocurrency&#x2019;s value has risen by more than 13% in the past week, although it has dipped more than 4% within the last 24 hours. Additionally, the Litecoin network is expected to halve its block reward in fewer than 77 days.</strong></p>
<h2>Litecoin Activity Soars With Ordinal Inscriptions Driving Transaction Boom</h2>
<p>This week, Litecoin has experienced a significant volume of transactions, mirroring the recent activity on the Dogecoin network. This heightened activity is primarily attributed to the substantial influx of Ordinal inscriptions, with Litecoin <a href="https://litecoin.earlyordies.com">registering</a> over <a href="https://litecoin.earlyordies.com/inscription/fa39046bfddd62a554f94f7054bf7e985456f0eddb9c9486772b159c890c8affi0">2.58 million</a> inscriptions to date. The growing number of inscriptions has significantly driven <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>&#x2019;s daily transaction volume this week.</p>

<p>On May 6, 2023, the number of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> daily transactions surpassed 400,000. By May 10, four days later, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> had processed over 584,000 transactions as <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/litecoin-transactions.html#3y">documented</a> by bitinfocharts.com. Just five days afterward, on May 15, Litecoin miners verified slightly above 500,000 transactions. Since February 22, 2023&#x2014;when <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> recorded just over <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/litecoin-network-adopts-ordinal-inscriptions-following-bitcoins-lead/">13,000 Ordinal inscriptions</a>&#x2014;the figure has soared by an impressive 198,694% within a span of 85 days.</p>

<p>In contrast to its recent decline of over 4% against the U.S. dollar, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> has registered a weekly growth rate of 13%. Ranked as the world&#x2019;s twelfth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Litecoin&#x2019;s Ordinal inscriptions have been circulating longer compared to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/drc20-tokens-take-dogecoin-community-by-storm-driving-record-breaking-daily-transactions-on-the-network/">Dogecoin DRC20s</a> or &#x201C;Doginals.&#x201D; Recently, Dogecoin saw its transaction numbers escalate significantly&#x2014;reaching an all-time high of approximately <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/dogecoin-transactions.html#3y">1.12 million DOGE transactions</a> on May 17.</p>
<p>On or around <a href="https://explorer.viawallet.com/halving">August 3, 2023</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> is projected to halve its block reward&#x2014;from its current 12.5 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> to 6.24 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>. In line with this shift, Litecoin will become the next proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain to halve its reward allocation, preceding Bitcoin Cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>), Bitcoinsv (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BSV" target="_blank">BSV</a>), and Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>).</p>

The legal action stems from the exchange’s ambitious FTX Stocks project, which was being pursued alongside the acquisition agreement with Embed, a stock clearing service.</strong></p>
<h2>Legal Battle Ensues as FTX Executives Accuse Former CEOs of Fraud in Relation to FTX Stocks Venture</h2>
<p>Representatives for FTX Limited and the subsidiaries Alameda Research and West Realm Shires (WRS) are suing three former FTX executives over a deal the company now believes is “worthless.” Prior to FTX’s bankruptcy protection filing, Bankman-Fried, Singh, and Wang allegedly purchased a stock clearing firm and FINRA-licensed broker-dealer called Embed. The deal was made so FTX could launch a service called FTX Stocks but the product never became reality.</p>
<p>FTX lawyers say the trio leveraged $248,010,467.02 of misappropriated FTX Group shares to settle the deal. The deal was finalized in “mere weeks” before the Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition date on November 11, 2022. “[Bankman-Fried, Singh, and Wang,] among others, took advantage of the FTX Group’s lack of controls and recordkeeping to perpetrate a massive fraud—lavishly spending the FTX Group’s assets on, among other things, private homes and jets, political and ‘charitable’ contributions, and various investments,” the lawyers said. “The acquisition of Embed was one such transaction.”</p>
<p>Allegedly, the entirety of the financing for the Embed acquisition was sourced from Alameda. Under the guidance of the FTX Insiders (Bankman-Fried, Singh, and Wang), the lawyers insist that Alameda covertly and unlawfully redirected and relocated assets that rightfully belonged to FTX.com, the primary global cryptocurrency exchange managed by the FTX Group, for the purpose of funding the FTX Insiders&#8217; personal endeavors. The alleged misappropriation of funds resulted in the FTX Insiders deceiving FTX.com&#8217;s creditors, which encompassed both customers and investors.</p>
<p>The lawusit further claims:</p>
<blockquote><p>They performed almost no due diligence on Embed and accepted the significant terms proposed by [Michael] Giles, Embed’s founder, CEO, and sole representative during the negotiation, who personally received approximately $157 million in connection with the acquisition. As a consequence, WRS paid far more than fair or reasonably equivalent value for Embed, and awarded Giles an extravagant and unwarranted retention bonus as an incentive to complete the acquisition quickly.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a bid to expedite the negotiation process, FTX Insiders not only agreed to a hefty price tag of $220 million for Embed but also included a provision in both the April 15, 2022 Memorandum of Terms and the June 10, 2022 Agreement and Plan of Merger that entailed a staggering $55 million retention bonus for the firm’s CEO, representing a quarter of Embed&#8217;s alleged value.</p>

<p>Ostensibly, the purpose of this substantial payment was to retain Giles as the CEO until the completion of the acquisition, even though FTX lawyers stress that he held no obligation to continue in that position beyond that point. This peculiar arrangement did not escape the notice of Embed&#8217;s remaining shareholders, FTX lawyers disclosed. A representative from Propel Venture Partners, the second-largest shareholder of Embed, allegedly expressed to Giles that he had “ha[d] never seen so much of a deal this size go to a founder … just unusual proportions.”</p>

The bitcoin mining machines will be hosted in data centers situated in Texas and Nebraska. The chosen sites for this endeavor are U.S. Bitcoin Corp’s Charlie, Delta, and Echo locations. </strong></p>
<h2>U.S. Bitcoin Corp Partners with Industry Leaders to Deploy 150,000 Bitcoin Miners in Texas and Nebraska</h2>
<p>Despite the challenges faced during the crypto winter of 2022, a significant surge in bitcoin mining operations is now underway. On May 18, U.S. Bitcoin Corp (USBTC) unveiled its ambitious plan to unleash a formidable army of 150,000 mining machines. The latest deployment will be executed in collaboration with five prominent bitcoin mining operations: Marathon Digital, Foundry USA, Sphere 3D, Decimal Group, and Teslawatt.</p>
<p>USBTC sealed a multi-year deal to host their machines at the company’s Charlie, Delta, and Echo locations. The Charlie facility, nestled in Kearney, Nebraska, will be one of the hosting sites, while the Delta site is located in Granbury, Texas. Notably, the Echo mining site in Upton County, Texas, co-located with a wind farm, is a shared facility with joint ownership between USBTC and Nextera Energy (NEE). This partnership with NEE was solidified in December 2022 when USBTC acquired its stake from Compute North.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our most recent partnerships with major hosting customers showcase our commitment to collaborative growth and innovation,&#8221; Asher Genoot, the president of USBTC said in a statement. &#8220;We continue to expand operations across sites both fully owned by USBTC and operated in partnership with pioneering site owners like Generate Capital and Nextera Energy.”</p>
<p>Genoot added:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are committed to driving the future of sustainable and efficient bitcoin mining infrastructure and our ability to secure major hosting contracts at these sites is a testament to this vision and our operating capabilities.</p></blockquote>
<p>Following in the footsteps of others in the industry, USBTC joins a wave of mining companies deploying machines on a global scale. Notably, Cleanspark made headlines by acquiring 65,000 bitcoin miners from Bitmain, with the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cleanspark-boosts-bitcoin-mining-capacity-with-acquisition-of-20000-bitmain-rigs/">transactions</a> occurring on <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cleanspark-purchases-45000-bitcoin-mining-devices-adding-6-3-eh-s-to-current-fleet/">two separate occasions</a> in 2023.</p>

<p>Another significant move came from Stronghold Digital, who forged a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/stronghold-digital-partners-with-canaan-subsidiary-to-boost-bitcoin-mining-capacity-by-400-ph-s/">strategic partnership</a> with a subsidiary of the mining rig manufacturer Canaan. Stronghold’s collaboration aims to unleash the power of 400 petahash per second (PH/s) through the deployment of Avalon-made ASIC machines.</p>

<h2><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a></h2>
<p>Xrp, formerly ripple, was once again a big mover in cryptocurrency markets, climbing by as much as 5% on Thursday.</p>
<p>Following a low of $0.4389 on Wednesday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>/USD rose to a peak of $0.4713 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>As a result of this surge, the token moved to its strongest point since April 30, when price was above $0.4800.</p>

<p>From the chart, it appears that this latest rise comes as the relative strength index (RSI) moved beyond a key resistance level at 55.00.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, price strength is at the 55.71 mark, with the next visible ceiling at the 61.00 point.</p>
<p>If bulls were to take the RSI to this point, there is a good chance that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> could recapture the $0.4800 level.</p>

<h2>Cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a>)</h2>
<p>In addition to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>, cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a>) also rose significantly, hitting an 11-day high in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a>/USD jumped to an intraday high of $0.3798 earlier today, which follows on from Wednesday&#x2019;s low at $0.3658.</p>
<p>This has resulted in the token climbing for a third consecutive day, reaching its strongest level since May 7.</p>

<p>Overall, cardano is up by as much as 7% in the past week, this coming as the 10-day (red) moving average begins to gain momentum.</p>
<p>Should the trend line continue to climb in its current direction, a crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart is highly likely.</p>
<p>For this to happen the RSI will need to break out of a ceiling at 47.00.</p>

According to the SEC, the crypto asset filecoin qualifies as a security under federal securities laws. Consequently, the securities regulator has requested that Grayscale withdraw the registration statement for its Filecoin Trust</strong>.</p>
<h2>SEC Labels Filecoin a Security</h2>
<p>In 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made significant determinations regarding the classification of various crypto assets. The regulatory body identified several crypto assets, such as <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/DASH" 312026  target="_blank">DASH</a>, ALGO, LUNA, UST, and OMG, as securities or investments based on their definition.</p>
<p>Notably, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/DASH" 312026  target="_blank">DASH</a>, ALGO, and OMG were explicitly mentioned in the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-deems-dash-algo-and-omg-unregistered-securities-in-bittrex-lawsuit/">lawsuit</a> targeting Bittrex. Bringing the focus to filecoin (FIL), the latest development arises from Grayscale&#x2019;s <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/05/17/2671509/0/en/Grayscale-Investments-Shares-Update-Regarding-Grayscale-Filecoin-Trust-Registration-Statement-on-Form-10.html">update</a> on the registration statement for the Grayscale Filecoin Trust.</p>
<p>Grayscale revealed that they recently received a &#x201C;comment letter from the SEC staff&#x201D; on May 16, stating that the underlying asset FIL in their trust is legally classified as a security. In response, the digital asset manager has been asked by the SEC to withdraw the registration statement for the Filecoin Trust.</p>
<p>However, Grayscale strongly disagrees with the SEC&#x2019;s viewpoint and remains determined to challenge the decision through litigation. &#x201C;Grayscale does not believe that FIL is a security under the federal securities laws and intends to respond promptly to the SEC staff with an explanation of the legal basis for Grayscale&#x2019;s position,&#x201D; the company said.</p>

<p>Filecoin (FIL) is a decentralized storage network designed by Protocol Labs, and the computer scientist Juan Benet, who is well known for his creation of IPFS. The mainnet for Filecoin was introduced in October 2020, and the following year in March 2021, Grayscale introduced the Grayscale Filecoin Trust.</p>
<p>In the update, Grayscale acknowledges that the SEC&#x2019;s response to their position remains uncertain, and the company may face a crucial decision: either &#x201C;register under the Investment Company Act of 1940 or, alternatively, seek dissolution of the trust.&#x201D;</p>
<p><em><strong>Will Grayscale Investments&#x2019; dispute with the SEC over Filecoin&#x2019;s security classification and other cases like these set a precedent for the future regulation of digital assets? Share your thoughts about this subject in the comments section below.</strong></em></p>
