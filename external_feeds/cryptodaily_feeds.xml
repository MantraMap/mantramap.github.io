			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s4">Since the unprecedented rise of Bitcoin and accompanying cryptocurrencies, we've witnessed the rise of various trends, meme coins of the most renowned. Ideally, meme coins are depicted by animated or comical memes with support from millions of enthusiasts globally. While hundreds of meme coins exist, approximately 340, per CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin Pepe is the latest coin in the market.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s4">Bitcoin Pepe is an internet meme featuring Pepe the Frog, an internet character surrounded by or holding Bitcoin or other crypto-related symbols. Over the years, this popular meme character has become a sign of support for Bitcoin and altcoins. And a verbal commitment to keep holding cryptocurrencies as part of a long-term investment strategy.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s9">Pepe the Frog and Bitcoin&mdash;the Connection&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s4">Created by cartoonist Matt Furi, Pepe was part of Matt&rsquo;s 2015 Boy&rsquo;s Club comic. The meme&rsquo;s popularity grew exponentially, especially on MySpace, 4Chan, and Gala Online. Now, while Pepe has existed since way before Bitcoin&rsquo;s revolutionary launch in 2009, the connection could be traced back to the origin of &ldquo;HODL,&rdquo; the popular crypto term for holding cryptocurrencies as long-term investments.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s4">A misspelling of the word &ldquo;hold&rdquo; on a Bitcoin forum created the term &ldquo;HODL&rdquo; and has become an integral part of Pepe and Bitcoin&rsquo;s existence. Pepe became a constant feature of most Bitcoin-themed memes and has become what we know it to be today&mdash;an unwritten representation of support for holding Bitcoin and altcoins. Pepe and Bitcoin&rsquo;s connection has led to a notable overlap as these separate yet intertwined cultures share similar values and beliefs.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s4">Like Bitcoin, Pepe has been caught up in controversies and hate, especially by the far-right corner. However, Pepe&rsquo;s connection to Bitcoin remains devoid of political sentiment and merely focuses on an irreverent view of traditional finance. Additionally, it highlights the influence of internet culture and emerging technologies. As well as how both can revamp, on a grander scale, cultural discourse.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s4">The commingling of Pepe the Frog and Bitcoin led to the creation and subsequent launch of Bitcoin Pepe&mdash;a revolutionary meme coin built on the premise of holding cryptocurrencies to earn multiple rewards.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s9">The $BTCPEP Token&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s4">Bitcoin Pepe allows its token&mdash;$BTCPEP&mdash;and NFT holders to earn BTC. Community members are rewarded in the form of BTC for holding on to $BTCPEP. It doesn't end there; Bitcoin Pepe also introduces upgradeable NFTs featuring Pepe the Frog in different positions, holding the Bitcoin logo.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s4">Bitcoin Pepe has a total supply of 222 billion $BTCPEP tokens. And according to the team, 60% of that was sent to a liquidity pool, locked and burnt. 10% will be paid for centralized exchange listings, bridges, and LPs. The remainder 30%, on the other hand, is locked separately and linearly vested over 12 months and will serve staking and rewarding purposes for its ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s9">The Project Roadmap&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s4">The Bitcoin Pepe team has released an ambitious yet realistic roadmap, split into four phases. Centralized exchange listing, token airdrop, collaborations, partnerships, and the highly anticipated BitcoinPepe NFT drop are part of the second phase of the roadmap.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s4">The launch of the dynamic Bitcoin Pepe ecosystem, staking and earning of $BTCPEP, NFT staking, Bitcoin Pepe merchandise, tools, and additional exchange listings are also a part of the third and final phase of the project roadmap. Through a series of marketing campaigns, the team hopes to reach and exceed 50,000 $BTCPEP holders at the end of the fourth and final phase of the project plan.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>PacWest Bancorp price is on the receiving end of a 24% loss today. Bitcoin is down 2%. Which of these is most likely to make a comeback?</p>
PacWest - dead man walking
<p>For PacWest Bancorp the writing is very much already inscribed on the wall. Down 83% since the end of February this year, we are just awaiting the last rites and for the fat lady to sing.</p>
<p>Deposits declined nearly 10% over the previous week, and the bleeding can only continue for so long before the shrivelled corpse of PacWest becomes the next casualty for the banks.</p>
<p>If the bank were to come back like Lazarus from the dead, the question would have to be asked &ldquo;who would think to put their cash into this bank&rdquo;? Of course, the answer would be &ldquo;nobody&rdquo;.</p>
What stops this banking crisis?
<p>Money markets return a better percentage than banks, and in this current environment they are certainly a lot safer. The banking crisis that is taking place now is going to be one that will be infernally difficult for central banks to put the lid back on.</p>
<p>When confidence goes in a bank it is only a matter of time. Back in the day, the banking system cracks could have been papered over. Yes, the odd bank might have failed but there were plenty of others, and the debt wasn&rsquo;t so ridiculously large.</p>
<p>However, the Global Financial Crisis of 2007/8 took the system to the limit, and the Federal Reserve had to pour currency back into the banks, and only just managed to stave off a potential globally systemic meltdown.</p>
<p>This time, the debt is exponentially worse and there are literally thousands of banks sitting on assets that are worth less than their liabilities.</p>
<p>Five banks are already gone. Credit Suisse was sold to UBS but had it not been, it could only have lasted a few more days before crashing into the dust, and sparking off a contagion which would likely have brought the whole industry down.</p>
Bitcoin stricken but otherwise healthy
<p>Amid this banking carnage Bitcoin is having some issues of its own. It really looks like it is going to head back down to the $25,000 support level at least.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be that as it may, this is likely a blip in Bitcoin&rsquo;s incredible trajectory. Going back to the $25k or $20k supports is a healthy correction before Bitcoin starts its latest bull run in earnest.</p>
<p>For such a scarce asset, which is outside of a crumbling financial system, the price is likely to head skywards. What will happen to the rest of the crypto ecosystem is a moot point. But for the average investor, Bitcoin at least is a flight to safety from what could be the most devastating financial crash in history.</p>
<p>It remains for the Federal Reserve, and the world&rsquo;s other premier central banks to do what they can to lift the traditional financial system out of a mire that is of their own making.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Cryptocurrencies have caught everyone by surprise since the arrival of the original cryptocurrency back in 2009. Nobody could see it coming, the revolution that has already gripped Millennials and Generation Z.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the world of cryptocurrencies, the rise of meme coins has been nothing short of remarkable. With their humorous origins, meme coins have captured the attention of crypto enthusiasts and investors alike.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now, a new player has emerged in the meme coin world, one that is already making waves in the market. Big Eyes Coin (BIG), a cat-themed meme coin built on the Ethereum blockchain, has outperformed established cryptocurrencies like Polkadot and Stellar during its presale phase, sending shockwaves through the crypto community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this article, we will explore the story of Big Eyes Coin, how it has risen to prominence so quickly, and what it means for the future of the meme coin market.</p>
<p>Stellar (XLM): A Stellar Show All the Way!</p>
<p>Stellar is a decentralized protocol with open-source code that facilitates the storage and transmission of cryptocurrencies. It enables cross-border transactions with a minimal fee between any currency pairs.</p>
<p>The Stellar blockchain was launched in 2014, utilizing the Federated Byzantine Agreement algorithm to enable faster and more economical transactions.</p>
<p>In 2017, Stellar gained significant attention after announcing its collaboration with IBM to establish multiple currency corridors for nations in the South Pacific.</p>
<p>The primary token on the Stellar blockchain is Stellar Lumens (XLM), which serves as the transaction fee.</p>
<p>Early in 2021, the value of the Stellar Lumens token grew more than five times to reach $0.73. However, it failed to surpass its all-time high value of $0.93 reached in 2018.</p>
<p>At present, the value of the Stellar Lumens token stands at $0.093, which is 48% lower than it was a year ago.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Polkadot (DOT): Smoother Transactions Made Possible</p>
<p>Polkadot is a blockchain protocol that has been developed to facilitate cross-chain communication and data sharing between different blockchains. The architecture of the network is composed of a series of interconnected para chains, each of which can be customized to serve specific use cases and operate independently of one another. The Relay Chain acts as a security layer and a governance mechanism for the network, enabling the para chains to communicate with each other seamlessly.</p>
<p>To ensure the accuracy and security of the network, Polkadot employs a consensus algorithm known as nominated proof-of-stake (PoS). This algorithm was inspired by the Ouroboros protocol and allows DOT holders to participate in the validation and agreement of transactions on the network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the native cryptocurrency of the Polkadot blockchain, DOT is used for various purposes including transaction fees, and governance. DOT tokens are also utilized in the consensus mechanism to incentivize network participants and ensure the stability and security of the blockchain.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, DOT was trading at $5.88 which is 64% lower than it was a year ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin (BIG): The New Kitty on the Block</p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin is a new cat-themed cryptocurrency built on the Ethereum Blockchain. BIG functions as the native currency within the Big Eyes Coin ecosystem. The presale of the BIG token commenced in August 2022, and since then, it has successfully completed 12 stages and entered the 13th stage. The presale has raised more than $34.5 million thus far.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>At the initiation of the presale in 2022, the value of one Big Eyes Coin unit was priced at $0.0001, which has shot up to $0.00053 in stage 13, marking a significant increase of 430% from its initial price. The project team is now targeting to set the launch price at $0.0006 upon completion of its presale in June.</p>
<p>To promote the presale, the Big Eyes Coin team has launched loot boxes at varying affordable prices, with the potential to win up to one million dollars worth of BIG tokens. Furthermore, those purchasing BIG tokens and loot boxes using the code END 300 can also avail of a 300% bonus.</p>
<p>As the presale draws closer to its conclusion on June 3rd, the team behind the cat-themed meme coin has announced that the BIG tokens will be launched on the Uniswap crypto exchange from June 15th onwards.</p>
<p>Conclusion&nbsp;</p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin has quickly become a significant contender in the realm of meme coins, surpassing well-established cryptocurrencies such as Polkadot and Stellar. The success of its presale, which has garnered over $34.5 million, has propelled the value of a single unit to $0.00053, representing a remarkable 430% increase from its initial price. Hence, the future of the meme coin market appears promising, with Big Eyes Coin spearheading the way.</p>

Big Eyes Coin (BIG), a cat-themed meme coin built on the Ethereum blockchain, has outperformed established cryptocurrencies like Polkadot and Stellar during its presale phase, sending shockwaves through the crypto community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this article, we will explore the story of Big Eyes Coin, how it has risen to prominence so quickly, and what it means for the future of the meme coin market.</p>
<p>Stellar (XLM): A Stellar Show All the Way!</p>
<p>Stellar is a decentralized protocol with open-source code that facilitates the storage and transmission of cryptocurrencies. It enables cross-border transactions with a minimal fee between any currency pairs.</p>
<p>The Stellar blockchain was launched in 2014, utilizing the Federated Byzantine Agreement algorithm to enable faster and more economical transactions.</p>
<p>In 2017, Stellar gained significant attention after announcing its collaboration with IBM to establish multiple currency corridors for nations in the South Pacific.</p>
<p>The primary token on the Stellar blockchain is Stellar Lumens (XLM), which serves as the transaction fee.</p>
<p>Early in 2021, the value of the Stellar Lumens token grew more than five times to reach $0.73. However, it failed to surpass its all-time high value of $0.93 reached in 2018.</p>
<p>At present, the value of the Stellar Lumens token stands at $0.093, which is 48% lower than it was a year ago.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Polkadot (DOT): Smoother Transactions Made Possible</p>
<p>Polkadot is a blockchain protocol that has been developed to facilitate cross-chain communication and data sharing between different blockchains. The architecture of the network is composed of a series of interconnected para chains, each of which can be customized to serve specific use cases and operate independently of one another. The Relay Chain acts as a security layer and a governance mechanism for the network, enabling the para chains to communicate with each other seamlessly.</p>
<p>To ensure the accuracy and security of the network, Polkadot employs a consensus algorithm known as nominated proof-of-stake (PoS). This algorithm was inspired by the Ouroboros protocol and allows DOT holders to participate in the validation and agreement of transactions on the network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the native cryptocurrency of the Polkadot blockchain, DOT is used for various purposes including transaction fees, and governance. DOT tokens are also utilized in the consensus mechanism to incentivize network participants and ensure the stability and security of the blockchain.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, DOT was trading at $5.88 which is 64% lower than it was a year ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin (BIG): The New Kitty on the Block</p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin is a new cat-themed cryptocurrency built on the Ethereum Blockchain. BIG functions as the native currency within the Big Eyes Coin ecosystem. The presale of the BIG token commenced in August 2022, and since then, it has successfully completed 12 stages and entered the 13th stage. The presale has raised more than $34.5 million thus far.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>At the initiation of the presale in 2022, the value of one Big Eyes Coin unit was priced at $0.0001, which has shot up to $0.00053 in stage 13, marking a significant increase of 430% from its initial price. The project team is now targeting to set the launch price at $0.0006 upon completion of its presale in June.</p>
<p>To promote the presale, the Big Eyes Coin team has launched loot boxes at varying affordable prices, with the potential to win up to one million dollars worth of BIG tokens. Furthermore, those purchasing BIG tokens and loot boxes using the code END 300 can also avail of a 300% bonus.</p>
<p>As the presale draws closer to its conclusion on June 3rd, the team behind the cat-themed meme coin has announced that the BIG tokens will be launched on the Uniswap crypto exchange from June 15th onwards.</p>
<p>Conclusion&nbsp;</p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin has quickly become a significant contender in the realm of meme coins, surpassing well-established cryptocurrencies such as Polkadot and Stellar. The success of its presale, which has garnered over $34.5 million, has propelled the value of a single unit to $0.00053, representing a remarkable 430% increase from its initial price. Hence, the future of the meme coin market appears promising, with Big Eyes Coin spearheading the way.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s5">There are over 27,700 cryptocurrencies for investors and traders to pick from, and as such, it can be difficult to make a decision as to exactly what they want to make an investment in.</p>
<p class="s5">However, by following the overall market narrative, they can have a much higher level of understanding of what direction the overall market is heading towards.</p>
<p class="s5">As such, with the recent decrease in the value of Polkadot (DOT) and Solana (SOL), investors and traders have turned towards the Sparko presale, and today, we will go over why this might be the case. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY SPARKLO TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s9">Polkadot (DOT) Sees 15.5% Decrease Despite Ecosystem Growth</p>
<p class="s5">Polkadot (DOT) announced its latest Polkadot Roundup with all of the highlights from a week of sustained activity and development.</p>
<p class="s5">Additionally, in June, two Polkadot (DOT) events were announced to take place in Prague, including Polkadot Prague and NFTs In Prague.</p>
<p class="s5">It is clear that the Polkadot (DOT) ecosystem is in full swing. However, its value has still been in decline. As of May 2, 2023, Polkadot (DOT) traded at $5.66. In the last 30 days, Polkadot (DOT) decreased value by 10.9%, and in the last two weeks, the crypto decreased by 15.5%, worrying investors. </p>
<p class="s9">Solana (SOL) Sees a Significant 11.2% Decrease</p>
<p class="s5">Solana (SOL) made waves in April when it introduced the Helium Network to the ecosystem, which finished its migration to the blockchain.</p>
<p class="s5">Additionally, Superteam announced that the Solana (SOL) Ecosystem Call came back. Superteam Germany also showcased the Sega smartphone at the event in Berlin.</p>
<p class="s5">As for the value of the Solana (SOL) cryptocurrency, as of May 2, 2023, it traded at $21.82. In the last two weeks, Solana (SOL) decreased by 11.2%. In the last 24 hours alone, the Solana (SOL) cryptocurrency has decreased by 2.1%.</p>
<p class="s9">Sparklo (SPRK) Gains Presale Momentum</p>
<p class="s5">Sparklo will be an innovative platform for alternative investments that enables anyone an opportunity to dive into the precious metals industry and make fractionalized NFT investments within silver, gold, and platinum.</p>
<p class="s5">Every time someone aims to utilize Sparklo and wants to make an investment, a non-fungible token (NFT) gets minted that represents a precious metal, such as a gold, silver, or platinum bar.</p>
<p class="s5">Then, these NFTs are fractionalized, which means that investors can either buy the full NFT or just buy a fraction of it.</p>
<p class="s5">As a cryptocurrency protocol, Sparklo will be the first platform to enable this type of functionality.</p>
<p class="s5">Throughout its level, one presale, the SPRK token trades at $0.017, and analysts predict a 40x jump in value upon launch.</p>
<p class="s5">We believe that this is an excellent opportunity for investors to get into the potential blue-chip crypto, which has significant growth for potential. As for its security, it has already been audited by InterFi Network. The liquidity on top of Sparklo will also be locked for 100 years.</p>

<p class="s5">We believe that this is an excellent opportunity for investors to get into the potential blue-chip crypto, which has significant growth for potential. As for its security, it has already been audited by InterFi Network. The liquidity on top of Sparklo will also be locked for 100 years.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s7">Yachtify (YCHT) is making waves in the crypto market, positioning itself as a more robust investment alternative to well-known tokens like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Cosmos (ATOM). With an innovative approach and a clear vision for the future, YCHT offers investors a solid opportunity for growth and long-term potential. </p>
<p class="s7">In contrast to the meme-driven nature of Shiba Inu (SHIB) and the challenges faced by Cosmos (ATOM) in an increasingly competitive market, Yachtify (YCHT) aims to provide tangible value and real-world use cases, ensuring a smoother journey for investors navigating the unpredictable waters of the crypto world.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY YACHTIFY TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s11">Yachtify (YCHT): An Unprecedented Investment Opportunity in the Yacht Industry</p>
<p class="s7">Yachtify (YCHT) represents a groundbreaking investment opportunity by offering a unique platform for fractional yacht ownership. The project aims to make the yacht market accessible to many investors, enabling anyone to earn passive income via investing in and owning fractions of boats. Yachtify is going to revolutionize the maritime industry by allowing users to buy, sell, and rent real-world yachts using its native token, $YCHT. $YCHT is currently available at an attractive pricing of just $0.10 and a generous 30% bonus during the ongoing presale.</p>
<p class="s7">The Yachtify Protocol opens the exclusive world of yacht ownership, once reserved for the wealthy, to cryptocurrency users. Each non-fungible token (NFT) represents a real-world yacht and can be fractionalized, enabling community members to buy a stake for as little as $100. High net worth individuals and charter businesses can then lease or purchase these private yachts, generating income or capital growth for investors. With Yachtify, investors can participate in a recession-proof maritime industry featuring multiple streams of income.</p>
<p class="s7">The Yachtify team has undergone a thorough KYC process, with the founder verified through an identity check. The project has been audited by SolidProof, ensuring that liquidity will be locked for life, and team tokens will be locked for 3 years. This level of security and transparency makes Yachtify a highly promising investment opportunity for those looking to capitalize on the booming yacht rental and charter industry.</p>
<p class="s11">Shiba Inu (SHIB) Holders Seek Better Opportunities: Is the Meme Coin Losing Steam?</p>
<p class="s7">In the constantly evolving world of cryptocurrencies, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has enjoyed a meteoric rise as a popular meme coin. However, with no tangible utility compared to rivals like Tamadoge, it seems the golden days of Shiba Inu may be waning. Currently, SHIB finds itself in a similar situation to Tamadoge (TAMA), with both coins experiencing a staggering 90% drop from their all-time highs.</p>
<p class="s7">While analysts predict a potential 50x surge for Shiba Inu during the next bull run, investors are growing increasingly restless. In the interim, many have begun exploring less speculative tokens that offer more than just hype. Shiba Inu's lack of real utility has raised concerns among investors, as the coin appears to be primarily propelled by market sentiment rather than tangible value.</p>
<p class="s7">Compounding these concerns, Shiba Inu's current price hovers around $0.000009, with its 24-hour trading volume plummeting by over 25% at the time of writing. As SHIB holders search for better gains, it remains to be seen if the once-prominent meme coin can regain its former glory or if it will be left behind in favor of more promising opportunities.</p>
<p class="s11">Is Cosmos (ATOM) Losing Its Edge as the Promised Blockchain 3.0?</p>
<p class="s7">Once heralded as Blockchain 3.0, Cosmos (ATOM) aimed to revolutionize the crypto landscape by connecting multiple blockchains and enabling seamless interoperability. However, with several other cryptocurrency projects, such as Ethereum's ERC-20 and Binance's BEP20, already providing similar functionality, Cosmos' unique value proposition appears to be waning. Investors are taking notice, as on-chain data reveals a gradual shift in capital allocation away from ATOM.</p>
<p class="s7">Compounding Cosmos' challenges, the recent rejection of its tokenomics proposal for ATOM 2.0 has left many investors disillusioned. The failure of the proposed framework, voted down by the Cosmos community, has dealt a significant blow to the project's prospects, raising questions about its future in an increasingly competitive blockchain ecosystem. As the pressure mounts, Cosmos (ATOM) must find a way to reassert its value and regain investor confidence or risk being overshadowed by more innovative and adaptable projects.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Globally, the crypto market constantly changes, and it doesn't come as a surprise. This is why investors are on the lookout for other ways to safeguard their investments and the potential cryptos to add to their growing portfolios. </p>
<p>As the crypto market matures, savvy investors are watching four cryptos with high potential for growth and massive returns. This article examines these cryptos and why having them in your portfolio is a great idea. </p>
<p class="s8">Scoop These Four Cryptos Before They Moon</p>
1. Conflux (CFX): The Blockchain Protocol That Empowers Decentralized Applications 
2. Cosmos Hub (ATOM): The Interconnected Blockchain Ecosystem Changing the Game
3. Lido DAO (LDO): The Liquid Staking Solution with a Promising Future
4. Uwerx (WERX): The Game-Changer for Freelancers Seeking a Reliable and Cost-Effective Platform 
<p class="s8">Cosmos Hub (ATOM): The Interconnected Blockchain Ecosystem Changing the Game</p>
<p>Cosmos Hub (ATOM) is an ecosystem of independent blockchains that are interconnected and built using multiple application components. This one-of-a-kind approach has developed the Interchain-Blockchain Communication protocol, which allows communication between these blockchains. </p>
<p>The Lambda upgrade and Replicated security live on the Cosmos Hub (ATOM) network have improved the chances of this crypto having a positive run. We predict that Cosmos Hub (ATOM)'s value will range between $14.83 and $22.24 by the end of Q4 2023. </p>
<p class="s8">Lido DAO (LDO): The Liquid Staking Solution with a Promising Future</p>
<p>Lido DAO (LDO) was designed to revolutionize staking by providing more use cases without compromising passive income. With Lido DAO (LDO), users can stake their funds and still have them remain liquid. </p>
<p>The introduction of Lido DAO (LDO)'s largest update Lido V2 and the much anticipatedEthereum Shanghai upgrade has caused a surge in Lido Dao (LDO)'s investors. Our current Lido DAO (LDO) Token price prediction suggests that the token's value is set to increase by 7.20% and reach $2.35 by Q2 2023. </p>
<p class="s8">Conflux (CFX): The Blockchain Protocol That Empowers Decentralized Applications</p>
<p>When you think about blockchain protocols that can help decentralized applications become faster and more efficient, Conflux (CFX) comes to mind. Currently, Conflux (CFX) is priced at $ 0.270403. </p>
<p>XCMG's partnership with Conflux (CFX) and Zen Spark Technology is setting new standards in the Web3 and blockchain market. As a result, our current prediction for Conflux (CFX)'s price suggests that its value may experience a dip of -18.09% and settle at $0.280531 by Q2 2023. But it'll eventually rise in the long run reaching $0.53045. </p>
<p class="s8">Uwerx (WERX): The Game-Changer for Freelancers Seeking a Reliable and Cost-Effective Platform </p>
<p>Uwerx will be a game-changer in crypto investments and the gig economy. Its innovative security measures are designed to protect investors from the risks of fraud, scams, and rug pulls. One of the unique features of Uwerx is that the project&rsquo;s team will renounce contract ownership after taxes are reduced to zero, instilling confidence in investors and providing them with a secure platform to invest their funds.</p>
<p>Uwerx will be committed to providing transparency and security, making it an ideal platform for freelancers seeking a reliable and cost-effective way to conduct their business. Compared to traditional freelance platforms that charge high service fees of up to 20%, Uwerx will only charge a fraction of that, at just 1%. </p>
<p>The Uwerx project has already received validation from reputable auditing firms, InterFiNetwork and Solidproof, further affirming its potential. The ongoing WERX token presale is another indicator of the project's bright future, with an initial price of $0.005 encouraging investors to purchase the coins before prices rise.</p>
<p>Uwerx plans a 25-year liquidity lock to ensure long-term stability after the presale ends. This measure will provide a steady price for the WERX token, making it an attractive investment for new and experienced investors.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, Uwerx is poised for significant growth. We predict that the WERX tokens will rise. By Q3-Q4 2023, the WERX token will be valued at $1.09 and $2.56 by Q1-Q2 2024. </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;&lt;Join Uwerx Presale Now &gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p class="s8">Final Verdict </p>
<p>Uwerx stands out as a promising investment option among other cryptocurrencies like Cosmos Hub (ATOM), Conflux (CFX), and Lido DAO (LDO). With its focus on security and long-term stability, Uwerx will offer investors a unique opportunity to reap substantial returns. The WERX token's stability and soon-to-be renounced contract ownership make it a standout option in the market. Especially with the 20% presale bonus currently ongoing.</p>

One of the unique features of Uwerx is that the project&rsquo;s team will renounce contract ownership after taxes are reduced to zero, instilling confidence in investors and providing them with a secure platform to invest their funds.</p>
<p>Uwerx will be committed to providing transparency and security, making it an ideal platform for freelancers seeking a reliable and cost-effective way to conduct their business. Compared to traditional freelance platforms that charge high service fees of up to 20%, Uwerx will only charge a fraction of that, at just 1%. </p>
<p>The Uwerx project has already received validation from reputable auditing firms, InterFiNetwork and Solidproof, further affirming its potential. The ongoing WERX token presale is another indicator of the project's bright future, with an initial price of $0.005 encouraging investors to purchase the coins before prices rise.</p>
<p>Uwerx plans a 25-year liquidity lock to ensure long-term stability after the presale ends. This measure will provide a steady price for the WERX token, making it an attractive investment for new and experienced investors.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, Uwerx is poised for significant growth. We predict that the WERX tokens will rise. By Q3-Q4 2023, the WERX token will be valued at $1.09 and $2.56 by Q1-Q2 2024. </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;&lt;Join Uwerx Presale Now &gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p class="s8">Final Verdict </p>
<p>Uwerx stands out as a promising investment option among other cryptocurrencies like Cosmos Hub (ATOM), Conflux (CFX), and Lido DAO (LDO). With its focus on security and long-term stability, Uwerx will offer investors a unique opportunity to reap substantial returns. The WERX token's stability and soon-to-be renounced contract ownership make it a standout option in the market. Especially with the 20% presale bonus currently ongoing.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has now zeroed in on the prominent Bitcoin mining company, Marathon Digital, over alleged violations of securities laws.&nbsp;</p>
Marathon Subpoenaed By SEC
<p>In a recent press release, the Bitcoin mining company Marathon Digital Holdings revealed that it had been subpoenaed by the SEC as a part of its ongoing investigation of the Montana Data Center involving the potential violations of securities laws.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marathon Digital, which is the second largest publicly traded Bitcoin miner in the US, was subpoenaed by the SEC to produce documents and information related to the company's operations. Marathon has stated that it intends to cooperate fully with the SEC's investigation.&nbsp;</p>
Marathon&rsquo;s Regulatory Troubles
<p>The company filed its quarterly earnings report on Wednesday, wherein it also shared the news of the subpoena.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Company received an additional subpoena from the SEC on April 10, 2023, relating to, among other things, transactions with related parties. We understand that the SEC may be investigating whether or not there may have been any violations of the federal securities law. We are cooperating with the SEC.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is not the first time Marathon has come under scrutiny from regulators. The company and its executives were subpoenaed back in September 2021, through which the SEC tried to gain access to the documents pertaining to the company&rsquo;s Montana-based facility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, around a couple of months back, the country was also in the news for internal accounting issues, which resulted in them reissuing several financial statements.</p>
CEO Calls Out &ldquo;Energy Concerns&rdquo;&nbsp;
<p>The SEC's investigation of Marathon comes at a time of increasing scrutiny of the cryptocurrency industry by regulators around the world. Last month, the SEC warned investors about the risks of investing in cryptocurrencies, including the possibility of fraud and market manipulation. The agency has also taken action against a number of cryptocurrency companies in recent years, including Ripple Labs, Coinme BitConnect, and Coinbase.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many regulators and government bodies have shown concerns over the high carbon footprint and energy demands of mining operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, Marathon&rsquo;s CEO Fred Theil recently questioned these perspectives claiming that industrial emissions are of significantly greater concern for their environmental impact.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He tweeted,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why focus on the environmental impact of the energy used by bitcoin mining when the heavy industry is responsible for around 22 percent of global CO2 emissions&hellip;After targeting bitcoin miners, will the administration propose an energy tax on generative AI data centers to protect the environment and jobs?&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Even after the positive CPI print of yesterday, Bitcoin is still looking depressed. With the market waiting for something to happen, Bitcoin might just surprise.</p>
<p>There is still a lot of fear in the crypto markets. FUD is all around in the mainstream media. Regulations are closing in and the US is still seemingly hell bent on closing crypto down.</p>
Bitcoin rally still on?
<p>However, bitcoin is still holding the current support at around $27,000, having dipped under $26,800 already this week. The downwards wicks are still getting bought up signifying that there is still a lot of interest in this bitcoin rally.</p>
<p>Should the price do the unexpected and rise, breaking through the downward trend line from April 10, there are a lot of short positions sat at around $30,000 to $31,000 and these could be squeezed out, leading to a rapid move to the higher $36k + region.</p>
Protect your purchasing power
<p>As mentioned already, there is a lot of FUD around crypto and this does include Bitcoin to some extent given the higher taxes that Biden wants to impose on crypto mining in the US.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, of all the cryptocurrencies Bitcoin is the most decentralised and the most unstoppable. We&rsquo;ve seen what happened when China banned crypto transactions completely - mining operations just relocated overseas, and now Chinese bitcoin mining has risen again to produce the second most hash power globally.</p>
<p>The banking crisis is not going away any time soon, and can potentially get far worse yet. The US economy is possibly heading for a severe melt down later this year and into 2024, and the Russia/Ukraine war still rages on.</p>
<p>People will need a way of protecting their purchasing power as the dollar and all other fiat currencies suffer more and more debasement as central banks do the only thing they still can, which is print more currency.</p>
Bitcoin bull run is still to come
<p>The mainstream media will continue to publish crypto scam this and crypto scam that, and a lot of this will be true. However, what the mainstream media will not tell you is that Bitcoin, and a few of the wildly innovative technologies in crypto, are likely to transform the financial landscape as we know it.</p>
<p>Bitcoin will enter its bull run in the next year or so, and a few of the best cryptocurrency projects may well join it.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The White House revealed on Tuesday that almost half of North Korea&rsquo;s missile program is funded by stolen crypto and cyberattacks. </p>
<p>CNN reports a White House official revealed earlier this week that about half of North Korea&rsquo;s missile project is funded through stolen cryptocurrencies and cyberattacks.</p>
<p>Anne Neuberger, deputy national security adviser for cyber and merging technology, explained the information was procured during a sweeping US federal government effort to understand &ldquo;how a country like [North Korea] is so darn creative in this space.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neuberger spoke at an event hosted by the non-profit Special Competitive Studies Project.</p>
<p>Neuberger further said the Biden administration is &ldquo;putting a lot of time and thought&rdquo; into working with US intelligence agencies to identify North Korean operatives. Treasury is hard at work tracing stolen crypto.</p>
North Korean Hackers Account for One-Third of Stolen Crypto
<p>North Korean cybercriminals have been revealed to be responsible for one-third of cryptocurrency losses. The infamous Lazarus Group has been linked to numerous high-profile hacks and thefts of digital assets and was responsible for the $100 million hack of Harmony Protocol&rsquo;s Horizon Bridge.</p>
<p>North Korea reportedly stole over $1 billion from the crypto sector through the activities of the Lazarus Group.</p>
<p>Reports from the United Nations and private firms indicate that hacking provides a key source of revenue for the Kim Jong Un-led dictatorship. Although rarely spoken about, US officials have long suspected that some stolen assets have funded Pyongyang&rsquo;s weapons development program.</p>
<p>Previous reports detailed that the US was increasingly worried about North Korea&rsquo;s efforts to fund its nuclear weapons program through digital assets.</p>
<p>In an attempt to curtail North Korea&rsquo;s efforts, the US treasury imposed sanctions on virtual currency mixer Tornado Cash for its alleged role in helping hackers launder proceeds from cybercrimes. Hackers have, however, resorted to new mixing services such as &ldquo;Sinbad&rdquo; to launder cryptocurrencies.</p>

North Korean Hackers Account for One-Third of Stolen Crypto
<p>North Korean cybercriminals have been revealed to be responsible for one-third of cryptocurrency losses. The infamous Lazarus Group has been linked to numerous high-profile hacks and thefts of digital assets and was responsible for the $100 million hack of Harmony Protocol&rsquo;s Horizon Bridge.</p>
<p>North Korea reportedly stole over $1 billion from the crypto sector through the activities of the Lazarus Group.</p>
<p>Reports from the United Nations and private firms indicate that hacking provides a key source of revenue for the Kim Jong Un-led dictatorship. Although rarely spoken about, US officials have long suspected that some stolen assets have funded Pyongyang&rsquo;s weapons development program.</p>
<p>Previous reports detailed that the US was increasingly worried about North Korea&rsquo;s efforts to fund its nuclear weapons program through digital assets.</p>
<p>In an attempt to curtail North Korea&rsquo;s efforts, the US treasury imposed sanctions on virtual currency mixer Tornado Cash for its alleged role in helping hackers launder proceeds from cybercrimes. Hackers have, however, resorted to new mixing services such as &ldquo;Sinbad&rdquo; to launder cryptocurrencies.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Uniswap decentralized exchange community is deliberating on a proposal to switch on Liquidity Pool Fees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The plan to switch on Liquidity Pool Fees would see money being funneled into Uniswap&rsquo;s treasury and token holders.&nbsp;</p>
A Critical Revenue-Generating Proposal&nbsp;
<p>The proposal under consideration would see fees switched on for many of Uniswap&rsquo;s liquidity pools. It is the latest development in a long-standing debate around Uniswap&rsquo;s broader finances and protocol fees. If the proposal is passed, then implementing fees on the pools would allow Uniswap to top up its treasury and give rewards to token holders of the protocol&rsquo;s native UNI token.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The protocol&rsquo;s decision to monetize its platform by switching on fees for a significant number of its V3 liquidity pools and all of its V2 pools could set a precedent for the larger decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Uniswap holds nearly 70% of the DeFi market share. The proposal&rsquo;s author, Getty Hill, stated that Uniswap could help monetize and bring in dollars and help build an excellent open-source protocol. Hill added,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Uniswap can monetize and bring in all these dollars by building a really great open-source protocol that gets usage, then that will incentivize other folks to do this too. I&rsquo;m hopeful that this kind of changes some of those industry norms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uniswap V2 has around $1.2 billion in total value locked and averaged around $367 million in daily trading volume on Ethereum over the past week, according to data from DefiLlama. Uniswap V3 is deployed on Curve, Balancer, SushiSwap, and a number of other networks. Uniswap V3 has around $2.9 billion in total value locked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, discussions are ongoing about how Uniswap would collect the fees and which initiatives the fees collected would fund. Hill has stated that community members would discuss and iron out the details before the proposal is put to a formal vote. This is not the first time Uniswap community members have called upon the protocol to activate fee switches on Uniswap liquidity pools. Last year, a similar proposal became a significant bone of contention within the Uniswap community. Ultimately, the proposal failed to garner enough traction and eventually fell through. Critics of the proposal had voiced concerns that such a move could have significant tax implications for Uniswap and its community.&nbsp;</p>
UNI Price Rises Amidst Proposal Anticipation&nbsp;
<p>As a result of the anticipation surrounding the proposal to switch on liquidity pool fees, the UNI token has significantly outperformed other cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). The token&rsquo;s value rose by nearly 3% over the past 24 hours, with trading volume rising by 45%. This suggested significant investor interest in the UNI token, as demonstrated by the growing value of the token.&nbsp;</p>
Uniswap On BNB Chain&nbsp;
<p>2023 has also seen Uniswap officially launch its services on the BNB Chain. The move was expected to significantly impact BNB Chain&rsquo;s trading traffic, thanks to Uniswap being the largest decentralized exchange by trading volume. Uniswap protocol users can also benefit from low transaction fees prevalent on BNB Chain. Director of Growth at BNB Chain, Alvin Kan, noted,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With BNB Chain&rsquo;s thriving and dedicated community, scalability, and accessibility, it is a launchpad for all things web3, where protocols looking to reach larger audiences can grow. We are delighted to see Uniswap&rsquo;s continued commitment to delivering value to its users and building for the future of decentralization.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>As he has for cryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin, Elon Musk sent the value of Milady Maker NFTs soaring after sharing a gif of the NFT on his Twitter handle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result of the tweet, Milady Maker NFTs rallied, posting an increase of 57% in a single day.&nbsp;</p>
Floor Price Surges&nbsp;
<p>The Twitter CEO shared a gif of the NFT which stated, &ldquo;There is no meme, I love you.&rdquo; As a result, the NFT collection surged, reaching the top trending spot on the OpenSea NFT marketplace. The tweet shared by Musk has been viewed millions of times and resulted in tens of thousands of interactions. Not only did the tweet send the Milady NFT community into a flurry of excitement, but it also sent the NFT prices through the roof.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to data sourced from NFT Floor Price, the entry-level price for the Milady Maker NFt collection on secondary markets rose from 3.75 ETH ($6920) to 5.25 ETH. This represented a rise of 57% in 24 hours. The price also briefly hit its all-time high, rising to 7.3 ETH before dropping back down to around 5.6 ETH. OpenSea also reported a market-wide surge in sales, with the collection selling over 600 NFTs, worth around $6.9 million, in an hour. This made it one of the best-selling projects on the platform.&nbsp;</p>
Controversy&rsquo;s Child&nbsp;
<p>Milady Maker NFTs are a collection of profile-pic NFTs. The collection is comprised of 9823 NFTs that feature wide-eyed, childlike faces. However, the project has been quite controversial since its inception. The price of the NFTs dropped significantly in May 2022 after creator Charlotte Fang acknowledged that she was behind a pseudonymous Twitter account that shared abusive and racist tweets. At the time, Fang stated that she had taken a step back and was stepping down from the team. Fang stated on her Twitter account,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;OK, full disclosure: I was Miya. And it&rsquo;s toxic baggage that&rsquo;s hurting the Milady community &amp; poisoning the vibe. I apologize about trying to hide the past account&mdash;Miya has nothing to do with Milady Maker &amp; should stay that way, so I&rsquo;ll be stepping down from the team from here. My real views hold no room for hate, and I detest abusers &amp; groomers&mdash;trolling about it was juvenile, but in reality, I&rsquo;ve never harmed a fly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Milady NFTs have also become a wartime meme among some NFT traders and crypto industry insiders. These users have begun using the Milady Maker artwork quite often on social media amidst increased scrutiny of the crypto space and crypto companies by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).&nbsp;</p>
Musk Launches AI For Crypto&nbsp;
<p>Besides pumping prices of NFT collections, Musk has also overseen the launch of X.AI, an advanced AI model specializing in crypto and blockchain. X.AI announced its official launch on the 3rd of May, 2023. X.AI GPT is an AI system that is based on machine learning and natural language processing, which helps it understand the context and generate text for crypto use cases. The CEO of X.AI, Martin Winward, stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are excited to introduce X AI GPT to the blockchain community. This AI model has been trained on massive datasets to gain a deep understanding of cryptocurrencies, DeFi, NFTs, and the metaverse. Developers and businesses can now leverage the power of AI to elevate their crypto products and services.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">The United States Department of Treasury and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) have filed 45 claims worth $44 billion against bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX and its subsidiaries.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The claims were filed under &ldquo;administrative priority,&rdquo; enabling the IRS to supersede the claims of unsecured creditors during bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The IRS assessed $20.4 billion in partnership taxes and payroll taxes against FTX's sister company Alameda Research LLC. The agency also filed claims of $7.9 billion, $7.5 billion, and $2.0 billion against Alameda Research Holdings.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">While Alameda Research was headquartered in Hong Kong, its founders and key personnel, including Sam Bankman-Fried and Caroline Ellison, are U.S. nationals. As such, they are liable for taxes on their worldwide income irrespective of their place of residence or how much time they spend in the U.S. each year.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In a previous coverage from CryptoDaily, a new proposal for the IRS' tax framework for crypto losses was forwarded, further complicating the situation for FTX. The framework would make it more difficult for investors to deduct their crypto losses, which could discourage investment in the crypto industry.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The framework is also complex and could be difficult for taxpayers to comply with. This could lead to increased tax audits and penaklties for taxpayers who make mistakes. Thus far, the IRS's proposed framework for crypto losses is a negative development for the crypto industry.

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">The United States Department of Treasury and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) have filed 45 claims worth $44 billion against bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX and its subsidiaries.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The claims were filed under &ldquo;administrative priority,&rdquo; enabling the IRS to supersede the claims of unsecured creditors during bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The IRS assessed $20.4 billion in partnership taxes and payroll taxes against FTX's sister company Alameda Research LLC. The agency also filed claims of $7.9 billion, $7.5 billion, and $2.0 billion against Alameda Research Holdings.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">While Alameda Research was headquartered in Hong Kong, its founders and key personnel, including Sam Bankman-Fried and Caroline Ellison, are U.S. nationals. As such, they are liable for taxes on their worldwide income irrespective of their place of residence or how much time they spend in the U.S. each year.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In a previous coverage from CryptoDaily, a new proposal for the IRS' tax framework for crypto losses was forwarded, further complicating the situation for FTX. The framework would make it more difficult for investors to deduct their crypto losses, which could discourage investment in the crypto industry.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The framework is also complex and could be difficult for taxpayers to comply with. This could lead to increased tax audits and penaklties for taxpayers who make mistakes. Thus far, the IRS's proposed framework for crypto losses is a negative development for the crypto industry. The framework could make it more difficult for investors to invest in crypto and could lead to increased tax audits and penalties.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The IRS's claims against FTX and its subsidiaries could also have a chilling effect on the crypto industry, with investors and businesses becoming less likely to participate in the crypto industry if they are concerned about being audited by the IRS, discouraging newer players.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Peace Inside Live, a Web3 mental health collective, has launched an NFT collection to promote the joy of missing out (JOMO) over the fear of missing out (FOMO). The collection, called the JOMO Effect, features a series of digital art pieces that represent various aspects of mental health and well-being.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Primary sale profits from the NFTs will be donated to five mental health charities, such as the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. Over 40 creators contributed digital art to the collection, which is available for minting on the Magic Eden marketplace via Polygon for 24 MATIC (around $21) as an open-edition for 24 hours. The "Joy List" or allow list, opened for three hours before the public mint at a price of 20 MATIC (roughly $18).</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">By participating in this initiative, collectors can access various resources and benefits like Chopra's Soul of Leadership course, Peace Inside Live's mindfulness materials, and discounts for Unstoppable Domains.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"We believe that the Web3 space can be a powerful tool for promoting mental health," said Shira Lazar, Emmy nominated host and co-founder of Peace Inside Live. "By focusing on JOMO, we can help people to find balance, take breaks, and focus on their own well-being."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">The launch of the JOMO Effect NFT collection is a timely response to the increasing focus on mental health in society. Efforts like these can help foster a healthier and more balanced approach to the digital world.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Web3 space is a rapidly growing and evolving ecosystem. With its potential to disrupt many industries, it's also equally important to consider the toll that Web3 could have on mental health. This writer, for instance, has struggled with the same issues on a personal level. In an effort to maintain journalistic integrity in the Web3 space, this writer has not held any amount in crypto beyond the what they are compensated for.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">One of the potential challenges of Web3 is the fear of missing out (FOMO). In the Web3 space, there is always something new and exciting happening. It can be easy to feel like you are missing out if you are not constantly connected and updated. This can lead to anxiety, stress, and even depression over financial opportunities missed.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"We hope that the JOMO Effect NFT collection will spark conversations about mental health in the Web3 space," said Lazar. "We believe that by integrating mental health into the core foundation of the industry, we can bring about a disruptive change."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">The JOMO Effect NFT collection is a positive step towards addressing the potential mental health challenges of Web3. By focusing on the joy of missing out (JOMO), the collection encourages individuals to find balance, take breaks, and focus on their mental well-being.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Here are some additional tips for promoting mental health in the Web3 space:</p>
<ul class="ul-list" data-mark="-">
<li class="md-list-item">
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Set boundaries. It is important to set boundaries between your work and your personal life. This means taking breaks, disconnecting from social media, and spending time with loved ones.</p>
</li>
<li class="md-list-item">
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Take care of yourself. Make sure to eat healthy, exercise regularly, and get enough sleep. These are all important for your physical and mental health.</p>
</li>
<li class="md-list-item">
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Seek help if you need it. If you are struggling with your mental health, please reach out for help.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Flare Network, a Ripple-supported Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) protocol, has announced its partnership with Google Cloud. The collaboration integrates Flare's API Portal with the Google Cloud Marketplace, making it accessible to anyone with a Google Cloud account.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Flare Network, a Layer 1 blockchain protocol designed to offer developers decentralized access to high-integrity data from other chains and the internet, has taken a significant step forward by integrating its API Portal with the Google Cloud Marketplace. This move marks the introduction of some of the first blockchain APIs on the platform, providing developers with easy access to blockchain transactions and up-to-date state data from Flare's nodes and Connected Chain nodes.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">#Flare has integrated its @APIPortal on @googlecloud Marketplace, launching some of the first #blockchain APIs on the platform. Developers can use the Marketplace to easily access nodes of the top blockchains, including BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP &amp; FLR.https://t.co/c3dFq6R0Oh</p>
&mdash; Flare ☀️ (@FlareNetworks) May 3, 2023

<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The integration expands Google Cloud Marketplace's built-in support for blockchain APIs, now encompassing Algorand, Binance&rsquo;s BNB Smart Chain, Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum, Flare, Litecoin, Songbird, and XRP. Future blockchain APIs added to Flare's API Portal will also be accessible to Google Cloud developers.By leveraging blockvchain APIs, developers can create applications that perform transactions and query on-chain data relating to the chain's latest state without the need to run their own node for each blockchain they want to interact with. This feature is particularly useful when developing cross-chain applications that require data from multiople sources. Major exchanges and wallets utilize the API Portal as a safeguard for their infrastructure.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The integration enables Google Cloud users to easily access all of Flare's current APIs through their existing Google Cloud account. Furthermore, expenses on Flare APIs through Google Cloud Marketplace can count towards a customer's committed spend on Google Cloud. Flare's VP of Engineering, Josh Edwards, highlighted the importance of the integration, stating that it reduces barriers to Web3 participation and enables developers to experiment with blockchain technology without incurring high hardware costs and maintenance.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">James Tromans, Head of Web3 Engineering at Google Cloud, expressed excitement about supporting and promoting Web3 partners in their ecosystem, citing Flare's high-performance APIs integration into the Marketplace. Flare's EVM-based Layer 1 aims to enhance the utility of blockchain by offering decentralized access to high-integrity data from other chains and Web2 sources. Every blockchain connected by Flare's data and interoperability infrastructure will ultimately be added to Google Cloud, granting developers access to the top 100 chains.</p>
