<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>The custodian will hold customers&#8217; assets and mirror user deposits on crypto exchanges.</li><li>Zodia dubbed the new service &#8220;Interchange&#8221;, per reports on Wednesday.</li><li>The crypto custodial company announced the offering at a time when crypto custody concerns remained a trending topic following FTX&#8217;s crash. </li></ul>



<p>Zodia, a crypto company that offers digital asset custody services, announced a service touted as a solution to cryptocurrency exchange insolvency. The new service dubbed “Interchange” will mirror client deposits on crypto trading platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This means that the crypto custodian will allow users to deposit their tokens with the platform. <a href="https://www.zodia.io/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.zodia.io/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Zodia</a> will then mirror client assets 1:1 on their preferred crypto exchanges. In theory, Zodia said Interchange will allow crypto participants to avoid investment losses and maintain access to their crypto even if centralized exchanges like FTX collapse. </p>



<h2>FTX Collapse Incentvizes Rethink On Crypto Custody From Zodia And Others</h2>



<p>Indeed, the crypto storage company unveiled the service in the wake of FTX’s collapse. Sam Bankman-Fried froze users from withdrawing their funds after Alameda’s balance sheet was leaked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The leak revealed that the two entities led by SBF were comingled, confirming fears harbored by FTX users and crypto participants alike. FTX eventually filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Delaware. Bankman-Fried also stepped down as CEO but has supposedly remained in the Bahamas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SBF, once a cryptocurrency tycoon, was the subject of probes, questions, and a congressional inquiry at press time. Congressperson Maxine Waters invited SBF to appear before a Financial services Senate committee and testify to events surrounding FTX&#8217;s collapse, although Bankman-Fried turned down the request to the chagrin on the crypto community.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Rep. Waters, and the House Committee on Financial Services:<br><br>Once I have finished learning and reviewing what happened, I would feel like it was my duty to appear before the committee and explain.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure that will happen by the 13th.  But when it does, I will testify. <a href="https://t.co/c0P8yKlyQt" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/c0P8yKlyQt</a></p>&mdash; SBF (@SBF_FTX) <a href="https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1599511560384225281?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">December 4, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Crypto custody resurfaced as a major topic of discourse within the crypto community, as signaled by tweets from prominent crypto proponents like Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, Kraken founder Jesse Powell, and Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Companies also responded to crypto user needs in the wake of FTX’s failure. Ledger, a crypto wallet maker backed by FTX and SBF, <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ledger-hardware-wallet-amid-ftx-debacle/">unveiled</a> their latest hardware wallet on Tuesday. Hardware wallets provide users with a self-custody option for their crypto, allowing customers to manage their tokens themselves and control their own private keys.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hardware wallet proponents rallied around a popular cry after FTX locked users out of their assets &#8211; “Not your keys, not your coins”. </p>

<ul><li>The funds in SushiSwap’s treasury can only sustain it for another 1.5 years.</li><li>The decentralized exchange is currently burning through $5 million a year.&nbsp;</li><li>CEO Jared Grey has proposed to divert all fees to the exchange’s treasury for one year.</li><li>A new tokenomics proposal is in the pipeline.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Decentralized exchange (DEX) SushiSwap has seen an alarming depletion in its treasury. Mounting expenditures paired with uncertainty in the crypto market pose a threat to the decentralized exchange’s operation. Jared Grey, the CEO or “Head Chef” of SushiSwap has spent the past two months analyzing the exchange’s finances. The&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sushiswap-approves-restructuring-proposal/" rel="noreferrer noopener">DEX</a>&nbsp;used to operate with an annual runway of $9 million. That figure has been brought down to $5 million, but that still translates to a runway of just 1.5 years. Grey has come out with a controversial remedy for this situation.</p>



<h2><strong>Proposal to divert all of SushiSwap’s fees to the treasury</strong></h2>



<p>The Head Chef has&nbsp;<a href="https://forum.sushi.com/t/reinstated-increase-kanpai-treasury-allocation-to-100/11475" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">proposed</a>&nbsp;that the Kanpai i.e. the portion of the fees that are sent to the exchange’s treasury, be increased to 100%. This would effectively divert all fees from the exchange to the treasury at the expense of Sushi stakers. This diversion of funds would last for a year or until the DEX implements new tokenomics. The SushiSwap chief has indicated that new tokenomics are currently in the works and may come into effect between Q2 and Q3 of 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>An additional benefit of Kanpai’s solution to the Treasury is the diversification of assets, which limits the need for market selling Sushi, which is a net positive for all stakeholders.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Speaking on the native token SUSHI, Grey revealed that it is currently near full distribution of its supply, ruling out the possibility to use it to fund SushiSwap’s expenses. According to data from&nbsp;<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/sushiswap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CoinMarketCap</a>, the token is currently trading at $1.25. The price has taken a significant hit of 9.5% since the CEO’s proposal came out. Head Chef Jared Grey had posted the same&nbsp;<a href="https://forum.sushi.com/t/withdrawn-kanpai-treasury-increase-to-100-for-1-year/11267" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">proposal</a>&nbsp;back in October, but it was withdrawn shortly after. It was reinstated following a thorough analysis of the DEX’s finances.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>Apple iPod creator Tony Fadell worked on the design for Ledger&#8217;s new hardware wallet.</li><li>The so-called Ledger Stax wallet will feature an e-ink display for users to view NFTs and crypto transactions directly on the device.</li><li>Stax&#8217;s release was announced amid increased interest in self-custody solutions following FTX&#8217;s crash.</li></ul>



<p>Ledger, a popular crypto hardware wallet company, teamed up with Tony Fadell for its Stax self-custody solution expected in Q1 2023. Fadell is credited for designing Apple’s iPod device.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The wallet maker’s CEO and chairman Pascal Gauthier expanded on the approach taken by the company for its Stax hardware wallet. CTO Charles Guillemet affirmed that the aim was to achieve mass adoption with a device that features accessibility and self-custody security for crypto users. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>When we designed Ledger Stax, our biggest requirement from a security standpoint was to fulfill those 3 security properties while improving user experience. What we did was reuse our Ledger Nano security architecture, then we improved the trusted display property.</p><cite>&#8211; Charles Guillemet, CTO.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Fadell designed the Stax hardware wallet with an e-ink display wrapped around the body of the device. Sources said users will be able to view their NFTs and transaction history from the interactive display.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the inside, there are built-in magnets to allow users to hold multiple devices securely together. Stax’s size is roughly the same as a regular credit card and features a USB-type C port. Ledger will offer its Stax wallet for $279 come 2023.</p>

<h2>Ledger’s Key Timing</h2>



<p>The company designs hardware wallets &#8211; crypto wallet solutions that allow users to directly manage their digital tokens and private keys. Following FTX’s crash in November, advocacy for self-custody among crypto participants and proponents alike increased.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Notably, FTX was an investor in the hardware wallet maker before the centralized crypto exchange went belly up. Ledger was however not exposed to the bankrupt platform and was not <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-bankrupt-sam-bankman-fried-resigns/">included</a> in the Chapter 11 filing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ian Rogers, chief experience officer at the wallet maker, told CoinDesk that sales increased as the FTX spiraled down. “We were ready,” Roger said, disclosing that the company set a new record for product sales on November 14, three days after FTX filed for bankruptcy in Delaware on November 11. </p>

<h2>Celsius Filed For Bankruptcy</h2>



<p>The once-premium crypto lender <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/celsius-network-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy/">filed</a> for bankruptcy after Terra imploded and shaved off over $40 billion from the markets. In the following weeks and months, so-called centralized entities like Celsius, BlockFi, Three Arrows Capital, and Voyager Digital all fell into ruin. </p>



<p>Following the chapter 11 filing, CEO Alex Mashinsky resigned in September amid rumors of malpractice at the company. An early October court filing revealed 14,000 pages of Celsius user transaction history, including Mashinsky’s trades as well as other top-ranking executives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The filing showed that Mashinsky, CTO Nuke Goldstein, and former CSO Daniel Leon all <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/celsius-users-doxxed-bankruptcy-filing/">withdrew </a>millions from the company’s custody accounts sometime between May and June 2022, around the time of Terra’s failure. </p>

<p>London-based crypto lender Nexo has announced that it will begin shutting down its operations in the United States. The lender will phase out its products and services from the country over the next few months.</p>



<h2><strong>Nexo is leaving due to a lack of regulatory clarity</strong></h2>



<p>According to the <a href="https://nexo.io/blog/nexo-announces-gradual-departure-from-the-united-states" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release</a> put out by the lender, the lack of regulatory clarity is one of the core reasons that prompted this drastic move. The inconsistent approach from state and federal regulators has only made things worse. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Our decision comes after more than 18 months of good-faith dialogue with US state and federal regulators which has come to a dead end.”</p></blockquote>



<p>The press release further revealed that in an attempt to please the regulators, Nexo had off-boarded clients from the states of New York and Vermont between 2021 and 2022. Additionally, the crypto lender suspended new registrations for all US clients for our Earn Interest Product. From 6 December onwards, the Earn Interest Product ban will be extended to 8 additional states, namely Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Wisconsin, California, and Washington.</p>



<p>Other efforts to get on the good side of U.S. regulators include registering token sales with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), delisting XRP following the SEC’s&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ive-always-felt-good-about-our-legal-arguments-and-i-even-feel-better-now-stuart-alderoty-on-securing-hinman-docs-in-ripple-vs-sec-case/" rel="noreferrer noopener">lawsuit</a>&nbsp;against Ripple Labs, and exiting the New York and Vermont crypto market at the request of officials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the above-mentioned efforts undertaken by Nexo, negotiations with U.S. regulators have fallen apart. The lender has indicated that there is a power struggle among regulatory agencies at the state and federal levels which has led to inconsistent decisions. The lack of clarity has also led to legal trouble for the firm as it faces enforcement actions by State regulators from <a href="https://dfpi.ca.gov/2022/09/26/dfpi-joins-other-state-securities-regulators-to-bring-actions-against-another-crypto-interest-account-provider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">California</a>, Kentucky, New York, Maryland, Oklahoma, South Carolina, <a href="https://dfi.wa.gov/sites/default/files/securities/enforcement-actions/S-21-3225-22-SOC01.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Washington</a>, and <a href="https://dfr.vermont.gov/sites/finreg/files/regbul/dfr-order-22-022-s-nexo.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Vermont</a>. These include cease and desist orders as well as a statement of charges. </p>



<p>Nexo has clarified that arrangements have been made with the company’s payment specialists so that all withdrawals can be processed in real-time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>Maple&#8217;s Monday statement said that Orthogonal Trading defaulted on eight loans worth around $36 million.</li><li>The loans were tied to two pools operated by Mavens M11 credit.</li><li>Maple founder Sid Powell expressed shock and disappointment due to the incident.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>DeFi lending protocol Maple Finance <a href="https://maple.finance/news/maple-severs-all-ties-with-orthogonal-trading/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://maple.finance/news/maple-severs-all-ties-with-orthogonal-trading/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">severed</a> ties with trading outfit Orthogonal Trading after the latter defaulted on eight loans worth $36 million. The lending protocol released a statement on Monday to inform the community of the decision.</p>



<p>According to the official announcement, Orthogonal’s loan accounted for 30% of all active loans on Maple’s crypto lending platform. The defaulted loans affected two liquidity pools &#8211; M11 USDC pool and M11 WETH pool.</p>



<p>Around $31 million of the defaulted loans were borrowed from the M11 USDC pool, per reports. A spokesperson for the <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/crypto-hacks-drained-1-billion-defi-2022/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/crypto-hacks-drained-1-billion-defi-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DeFi</a> lender told The Block that the incident could affect approximately 80% of the investors left in the pool. The loans taken from the M11 WETH pool were worth around $5 million.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Orthogonal Trading was a key member of Maple’s ecosystem prior to Monday&#8217;s incident. The firm’s trading division offered loans to the platform’s users and operated a USDC lending pool with over $850 million in loans at press time.</p>



<h2>Maple Finance Founder disappointed&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Monday’s statement said the “decision to cut the relationship with the Orthogonal Credit team is not taken lightly”. Sid Powell, founder of Maple Finance, also expressed shock and disappointment at the development.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Maple will not work with bad actors or with firms that misrepresent their financials or business operations. We are shocked and disappointed in the behavior of others and this is not a representation of how we do business. </p></blockquote>

<p></p>



<p>We have witnessed one of the most intense months in the crypto industry, with FTX&#8217;s fallout and other key players that followed, such as Genesis, Voyager, and BlockFi. Fear, uncertainty, and doubt are at high levels within media outlets as Bitcoin is once again declared dead, and the BTC price dropped to levels as low as $15,700.</p>



<p>&#8220;Crypto is now dead: FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange, collapsed last week, proving a lot of cool guys horribly wrong,&#8221;. <a href="https://twitter.com/chetan_bhagat/status/1592381582144593922/photo/1" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/chetan_bhagat/status/1592381582144593922/photo/1" rel="nofollow noopener">Tweets</a> like this were all over social media when one of the largest crypto exchanges, FTX, <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-letter-ftx-employees/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-letter-ftx-employees/">collapsed</a>, taking many prominent players with them.</p>



<p>But amid all this uncertainty, long-term Bitcoin holders remain undeterred, and in fact, the pattern is as such that they are currently increasing their long-term Bitcoin holdings.</p>



<p>According to the GlassNodes chart, Bitcoin Hold Waves, this November marked an all-time high of BTC long-term holders, who are now at 66% percentage on the chart. The long-term holders, 3yr to 10 yr, have been holding at a rate like never before, as the percentage of their holdings keeps increasing.</p>



<p></p>

<p>FTX&#8217;s fallout did not move the BTC markets as much as expected, and this could be due to the low-conviction holders already selling and leaving the crypto industry. It is yet to be confirmed whether this is the bottom of the markets; however, it appears that &#8220;bad news&#8221; is not necessarily affecting BTC price as dramatically as before. This could be because there are no low-conviction sellers in the market currently.</p>



<p>This is not to say that sellers won&#8217;t be there in a further fallout due to other factors such as miner capitulation, taxes and inflation.</p>



<h2>Bitcoin Miners Due Capitulation?</h2>



<p>According to <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/quicktake/63831e88be1d61477fefe63a-Miners-are-going-to-capitulate-again" data-type="URL" data-id="https://cryptoquant.com/quicktake/63831e88be1d61477fefe63a-Miners-are-going-to-capitulate-again" rel="nofollow noopener">CryptoQuant</a> analyst Kripto Mevsimi, a further miner capitulation is due to reappear. Mevsimi posted his last capitulation analysis on 6th of June 2022, when the price of BTC was $31,500 and within 1 to 2 days, the price became $18,000. According to him, hte same setup is now forming on the hash ribbon metric.</p>

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;So right now bitcoin difficulty is really high for miners so that means; costs are getting higher and doing business in this kind of environment is getting harder,&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why miners do not work in full force. If they have efficient- new generation mining machines, they put them into work but that&#8217;s all. Inflation is high and people feels effect of living costs, bitcoin price is declining, mining cost and difficulty is getting higher. Tough environment for miners.&#8221; wrote Kripto Mevsimi in his most recent blog post.</p>



<p>Kripto Mevsimi confirms that a change in mining difficulty could potentially help the situation.</p>



<p>According to data from BTC.com, mining difficulty is set to drop at 7.08% at the time of writing.</p>

<p>Sam Bankman-Fried, the ex-CEO of now-bankrupt exchange FTX and FTX.US, is said to have donated &#8220;dark money&#8221; to the democratic party. Elon Musk took to Twitter to say that he believes the undisclosed number of democratic party donations probably reached over $1B, whereas only $40M were disclosed.</p>

<p>In a recent interview with crypto journalist Tiffany Fung, SBF stated that he donated to both parties equally.&#8221;I donated to both parties. I donated about the same amount to both parties,&#8221; Bankman-Fried tells Tiffany Fung on a phone interview.</p>

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;All my Republican donations were dark,&#8221; he said, referring to political donations that are not publicly disclosed. &#8220;The reason was not for regulatory reasons; it&#8217;s because reporters freak the fuck out if you donate to Republicans. They&#8217;re all super liberal, and I didn&#8217;t want to have that fight.&#8221;</p>



<p>As SBF admits that some of the donations were not publicly disclosed, it seems likely that more non-publicly disclosed donations to the democratic party.</p>



<p>Undisclosed donations have been made possible by the supreme court&#8217;s decision in the Citizen United case, which allows donors to donate anonymously. Since this decision, more than $1bn have poured into federal elections since 2010.</p>



<p>Elon Musk is very vocal on Twitter regarding the SBF case and the FTX bankruptcy scandal. On 13th of November Musk tweeted to hint that SBF is a major donor on the democratic party therefore he believes there will be no investigation by the SEC towards the exchange.</p>



<p>Republican Senator Ted Cruz also called FTX &#8220;a Bernie Maddof style fraud that cost investors Billions&#8221;.</p>

<p>On December 1st Senate held a hearing to discuss and urge lawmakers to act quicky in installing a regulatory framework for digital assets.The hearing was hosted by the Senate Agriculture Comittee and did not include the main person at the center of this scandal, CEO Sam-Bankman Fried. The person invited to testify was Rostin Banham, the Chairman of Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), agency that regulates the derivate markets. Benham called on immediate oversight of most crypto markets and &#8220;comprehensive market regulation.&#8221;</p>



<p>Benham&#8217;s testimony is controversial as he had a very close working relationship with Bankman-Fried over the last year. The Bill advocated in the hearing was the same one that Bankman-Fried encouraged himself earlier this year which has been questionable.</p>



<p>Denis Keheller, the president of advocacy group Better Markets argued over the influence SBG would have had on the CFTC. It is unclear how much access influence Sam-Bankman Fried may have bought at the agency.</p>



<p>“When something like this happens, typically you have an overreaction of elected officials of the need to crack down on the industry,” he says. “Instead, this hearing is to push a bill that was endorsed and pushed by FTX.”</p>
