<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) remained on the defensive early in the Asian session as the pair tested the 30000 figure following a fresh round of selling pressure that grew stronger around the 30368.03 area.&nbsp; &nbsp;Following recent selling pressure, areas of potential technical support and buying pressure include the 29863, 29427, 28886, 28804, 28182, 28096, and 27306 areas.&nbsp; Buying pressure recently intensified just above the 30198.14 area and 29863.96 area, retracement levels associated with buying pressure that rallied around the 26165.98 and 24750 areas.&nbsp; &nbsp;The pair&rsquo;s recent print around the 31443.67 area was a twelve-month high and test of an upside price objective associated with buying pressure that strengthened around the 26637.41 area.&nbsp; &nbsp;Stops were also recently elected above the 30127.80 area during the appreciation, an upside price objective associated with historical buying pressure that emerged around the 15460 and 19568.52 areas.</p>
