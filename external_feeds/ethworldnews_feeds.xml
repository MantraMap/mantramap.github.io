<ul><li>Voyager Digital has won the bankruptcy court’s approval to start repaying its creditors and customers.&nbsp;</li><li>The bankrupt crypto lender’s customers will only be able to recover 35% of the amount they’re owed.&nbsp;</li><li>The repayment to customers may go up depending on the outcome of third-party claim disputes.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York has approved Voyager Digital’s Chapter 11 plan to wind down its operations and distribute its remaining assets to customers. The latest development comes as much-needed good news for the crypto lender’s customers who have been stranded since the firm filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July last year.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Additional Repayment To Customers Contingent On Voyager’s Outstanding Claim Disputes</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-17/voyager-cleared-to-liquidate-start-repaying-customers-crypto#xj4y7vzkg" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, Manhattan bankruptcy Judge Michael Wiles approved Voyager’s Chapter 11 procedures which laid out its plans to execute liquidation and repayment to creditors. The procedures, which were <a href="https://cases.stretto.com/public/x193/11753/PLEADINGS/1175305052380000000083.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">filed</a> earlier this month, informed the court how the bankrupt crypto lender planned to manage its remaining assets worth over $1.3 billion. The amount represents about 76% of the aggregate value of customer claims against Voyager’s bankruptcy estate. Voyager’s customers are owed over $1.7 billion as per bankruptcy filings. </p>



<p>However, the customers will only receive 35.72% of their claim amount. According to the bankrupt crypto lender, the remaining amount will be held back until all outstanding claims disputes with third parties are settled. As per the initial creditor recovery calculation, $445 million will be held back on account of the preference claims associated with the bankrupt crypto exchange FTX and its sister firm Alameda Research. Voyager plans to retain another $135.6 million for its litigation reserve and to pay for the wind-down costs. An additional $49.9 million will be held back for administrative and priority tax claims. Adding another $74.1 million related to miscellaneous holdbacks, the subtotal of holdbacks comes to $704.6 million.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Voyager has stated that the customers may receive more than 35% of their claim amount, depending on the outcome of preference claim disputes related to FTX and Alameda Research. The customers may see additional <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/voyager-digital-to-repay-creditors-coming-weeks/">repayment</a> given that the Voyager bankruptcy estate is also a creditor in the Three Arrows Capital liquidation. All subsequent recoveries will be made in either cash or crypto at the Plan Administrator’s discretion.</p>

<ul><li>A parliamentary committee in the UK wants unbacked crypto assets to be regulated as gambling rather than financial activity.&nbsp;</li><li>The Treasury Committee’s latest report compelled the government to treat crypto assets like BTC and ETH as gambling instruments.</li><li>The committee highlighted the risk to retail investors from the volatility associated with crypto trading.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Lawmakers in the United Kingdom want unbacked crypto assets to be held to the same standards as gambling instruments. The House of Commons Treasury Committee published a report earlier today which compelled the government to <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bahamas-stricter-crypto-regulations-ftx/">regulate</a> crypto trading and related investments as gambling. </p>



<h2><strong>Crypto Including BTC &amp; ETH To Be Regulated As Gambling</strong></h2>



<p>According to the 28-page <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5803/cmselect/cmtreasy/615/report.html" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a> that was put together by lawmakers from multiple parties, mainstream crypto assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum should be regulated as gambling. The lawmakers argued that the potential use of such cryptocurrencies by fraudsters and money launderers poses a significant risk to consumers and the economy. The report compelled the UK government to recognize and regulate unbacked cryptocurrencies as gambling instruments. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>With no intrinsic value, huge price volatility and no discernible social good, consumer trading of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin more closely resembles gambling than a financial service, and should be regulated as such.” </p><cite>Harriett Baldwin, member of Parliament and Chair of the Treasury Committee </cite></blockquote>



<p>The lawmakers behind the report argued that the volatility associated with the trading of unbacked crypto assets categorized it as sports betting rather than investing. To that end, the government has been recommended to not consider crypto trading a financial activity. The report comes amid the government’s plans to develop comprehensive regulations for the crypto industry. The lawmakers have warned that regulating retail crypto trading will create a “halo effect”, prompting retail investors to perceive crypto trading as safer than it is.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Treasury Committee’s report took into account the events that transpired in the crypto industry in 2022. The string of bankruptcies and scandals cost crypto investors billions of pounds and highlighted the risks associated with crypto assets. However, the report acknowledged that crypto’s underlying blockchain technology may be of use to the country’s financial sector.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>The SEC’s motion to keep the infamous Hinman documents sealed has been denied by the court.&nbsp;</li><li>District judge Analisa Torres’ latest ruling comes in the closely watched legal battle between the SEC and Ripple.&nbsp;</li><li>The Hinman documents contain details of a former top-ranking SEC official who stated that Ether was not a security.&nbsp;</li><li>The documents are a critical part of Ripple’s defense in the lawsuit filed by the SEC.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>In a major win for Ripple, Judge Analisa Torres of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York has denied the Securities and Exchange Commission’s motion to seal the infamous Hinman documents. The latest <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/xdx73gwan6ybtlq/Order%20Denying%20Motion%20to%20Seal%20Hinman%20Documents.pdf?dl=0" rel="nofollow noopener">ruling</a> comes almost five months after Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn initially ordered the <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-continue-enforcement-action-coinbase/">SEC</a> to hand over the Hinman documents to Ripple as part of the discovery process. </p>



<h2><strong>Major Win For Ripple In Legal Battle With The SEC</strong></h2>



<p>James K. Filan, a lawyer who has become popular in the crypto community, took to <a href="https://twitter.com/FilanLaw/status/1658586752121024512" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a> earlier today to share the latest development in the SEC’s controversial lawsuit against Ripple. District Judge Analisa Torres upheld the previous ruling by Judge Netburn and ruled that the securities regulator cannot seal the Hinman documents since they were relevant to the judicial process. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Sealing these documents would not be related to preserving &#8216;openness and candor&#8217; within the agency, nor would such an interest be substantial enough to outweigh the strong presumption of public access.&#8221; </p><cite>District Judge Analisa Torres</cite></blockquote>



<p>The Hinman documents contain internal communications and statements made by William Hinman, the SEC’s former Director of Corporation Finance. The ex-SEC official stated in 2018 that Ether was not a security. The documents also contain the SEC staff’s preliminary views and legal analysis of XRP. The documents provide an insight into the SEC’s initial stance on XRP, making them a critical part of Ripple’s defense in the lawsuit filed by the securities regulator in December 2020. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Another win for transparency! Unredacted Hinman emails to be publicly available soon &#8211; stay tuned as the lawyers work through the mechanics to make that happen. <a href="https://t.co/o6puPypRHd" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/o6puPypRHd</a> <a href="https://t.co/qmaLVeQaP8" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/qmaLVeQaP8</a></p>&mdash; Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) <a href="https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1658621618741186560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">May 16, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The order issued by Judge Torres allowed the SEC to redact the personal information of people named in the documents. The judge also approved several redactions proposed by Ripple in its documents. However, several redactions related to XRP were denied by the judge. News of the latest ruling led to a 4% surge in XRP’s price.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/justin-sun-apologize-binance-cz-sui-tusd/">Justin Sun</a>, the crypto entrepreneur who acquired crypto exchange Huobi Global last year, has called out a relative of Huobi’s founder for driving down the price of the exchange’s native HT tokens by repeatedly dumping them in the market. The HT tokens in question were reportedly given to the concerned relative for free during the initial token airdrop. </p>



<h2><strong>Huobi Founder Asks Justin Sun To Provide Evidence </strong></h2>



<p>Justin Sun took to <a href="https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1658413236360998913" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a> earlier today to publicly accuse Li Wei, the brother of Huobi founder Li Lin, of market dumping large amounts of zero-cost HT tokens. Sun revealed that when HT was initially distributed, Li Wei received millions of HT tokens for free. Wei has reportedly been selling his pile of HT through Huobi over the past few months and cashing out the profit. The impact of the dumping on HT’s price has prompted the decentralized autonomous organization behind HT to take cognizance of the questionable trades and step in to rectify the matter. </p>



<p>The Tron founder informed the Huobi community on Twitter that in the interest of HT investors, the Huobi Global Advisory Committee and the HT DAO community have decided to recover and destroy the HT tokens obtained by Li Wei at zero cost. The burning of said tokens will be announced in the HT community soon. Huobi founder Li Lei reportedly responded to Sun’s allegations by asking for evidence of the transactions made by his brother. Lei reportedly pledged 10x compensation to the exchange if the allegations are proven.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>As a platform that has been established for ten years, Huobi will never condone this behavior on the way back to the top three, and will never let anyone who really buys HT in the spot market be disappointed! We must be responsible to the end!”</p><cite>Justin Sun</cite></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">After all, Li Wei has not made any substantial contributions to our community.

</div></figure>



<p>Justin Sun revealed that the advisory council and the HT DAO plan to negotiate the return of the zero-cost HT tokens from Li Wei. The recovered token will subsequently be destroyed. Sun added that the HT DAO community will ask Wei to return the profit he made from previous sales of HT tokens. These funds would be used to acquire and burn more HT tokens.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Ledger’s latest update touted as an “additional safety net” received backlash from customers and crypto Twitter commentators.</li><li>The company’s response on social media left users unconvinced and seemingly did little to address security concerns&nbsp;regarding private keys and a new attack vector that the recovery firmware could unearth.</li><li>Ledger Recover will allow users to opt-in for a monthly subscription to back up their seed phrase with another seed phrase stored at three custodians, two of which are third-party.</li></ul>



<p>Crypto Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/Ledger/status/1658458737957322753" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/Ledger/status/1658458737957322753" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">brimmed</a> with opposition to Ledger&#8217;s latest firmware feature that will back up customers&#8217; seed phrase if they choose to opt-in to a monthly subscription for custody services. </p>



<p>Ledger Recover was <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/crypto-users-ledger-seed-phrase-recovery/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/crypto-users-ledger-seed-phrase-recovery/" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> on May 16 much to the sock of customers thanks to a supposed turnaround on the company&#8217;s so-called dedication to security. The firmware update will give wallet users the option to back up their seed phrase with three custodians, a feature meant as a safeguard should any user lose their private keys.</p>



<h2>Ledger Defends Recover Subscription</h2>



<p>The hardware wallet maker clarified &#8211; after heavy community backlash &#8211; that the seed phrase sent to custodians is generated as an additional private key of sorts. A Twitter thread was released explaining the mechanics, although the post seems to have raised more questions than answers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Individually, these encrypted fragments are completely useless.

</div></figure>



<p>Ledger Recover encrypts a version of your private key, splits it into three parts, and sends each part or shard to one of three custodians if a customer chooses to subscribe. The feature is currently only available on the company&#8217;s Nano X wallet. Although, customers raised concerns that an update could expose their seed phrase to anyone but themselves, a thing that was previously thought impossible on any Ledger device. </p>

</div></figure>



<p>Security expert and Polygon Labs CISO Mudit Gupta noted that private keys could be reconstructed using 2/3 of the shards, a problem that leaves wallet users open to a new attack vector. </p>



<p>Other users on Twitter completely rejected the update and asked the wallet maker to bin the idea or release a separate wallet product line for the recovery feature.</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>27 member states in the EU&#8217;s council wholly supported the bloc&#8217;s Markets in Crypto Assets regulation or MiCA during a vote on May 16.</li><li>European Union ministers also backed new crypto tax laws mandating that operators disclose users&#8217; holdings to relevant agencies as lawmakers hope to mitigate tax evasion.</li><li>Today&#8217;s vote brings MiCA&#8217;s implementation one step closer, with the crypto policies expected to officially activate around mid-2024.</li></ul>



<p>27 member states in the European Union&#8217;s council <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/general-secretariat/corporate-policies/transparency/open-data/voting-results/?meeting=3948" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/general-secretariat/corporate-policies/transparency/open-data/voting-results/?meeting=3948" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wholly supported</a> the bloc&#8217;s Markets in Crypto Assets regulation or MiCA during a vote on May 16. The unanimous vote signals one of the final steps before MiCA passes into law and officially regulates crypto operators across Europe.</p>



<p>Today&#8217;s vote unsurprisingly passed after growing support for the bill among EU ministers and lawmakers alike. The bill had to garner support and pass official votes from two sides of the bloc &#8211; the EU&#8217;s council and parliament which already backed the bill during a vote in April. </p>



<p>Indeed, the bloc&#8217;s crypto rules won a 13-1 landslide after 517 EU policymakers <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/mica-wins-vote-crypto-licensing-europe/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/mica-wins-vote-crypto-licensing-europe/" rel="noreferrer noopener">voted</a> &#8220;Yes&#8221; in favor of the watershed crypto rules.</p>



<p>The EU will now publish MiCA in its Official Journal following support from both parliamentary negotiators and EU council members. However, it will take 12-18 months for the policies to take full effect and begin standardizing the EU&#8217;s crypto market. Operators will be afforded this time to comply with the policies or risk being booted out of Europe.</p>



<h2>Crypto Tax And AML Checks Agreed On After MiCA Vote</h2>



<p>The bloc&#8217;s members also made headway on new crypto tax laws and anti-money laundering systems. Crypto operators will be required to disclose customer holdings to tax agencies and new AML measures were agreed on to &#8220;prevent the misuse of the crypto industry for the purposes of money laundering and financing of terrorism&#8221;.</p>



<p>Sweden&#8217;s Finance Minister stressed that regulating the crypto-assets sector is in the best interest of Europeans who invested in these assets and the operators who offer them.</p>



<p>Today&#8217;s vote means that the EU will become the first major jurisdiction in the world to implement crypto rules and install a standard licensing policy. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Ledger&#8217;s latest firmware update will allow users to split their seed phrase into shards and backup this sensitive information with three custodians including the company itself.</li><li>Users will have to pay a monthly subscription fee and provide a copy of their passport/national identity card to sign up for this service.</li><li>The crypto community expressed concerns that this update could jeopardize wallet security by exposing private keys to third parties.</li><li>Crypto proponents also cited Ledger&#8217;s previous data breach from 2020.</li></ul>



<p>Crypto wallet maker Ledger announced a new recovery service that will allow users to back up their seed phrase with third-party custodians as the company moves to slot in an extra safety net for users. </p>



<p>Crypto holders and proponents reacted to the firmware update with skepticism, mainly arguing that the service could jeopardize wallet security and incentive crypto scammers. </p>



<h2>Ledger Recovery</h2>



<p>The firmware update called &#8216;Ledger Recovery&#8217; will give customers the option to split their seed phrase into shards and back up this recovery phrase with three custodians &#8211; the wallet marker itself, crypto custody firm Coincover, and code escrow company EscrowTech.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>If somebody loses their recovery phrase, two of the three shards can be combined—pending an ID check—to regain access to the locked funds. Essentially, Ledger Recover is an additional safety net; for the price of $9.99 a month, it takes the jeopardy out of crypto’s version of stuffing dollars under the mattress. It’ll be available in the UK, EU, US, and Canada and come to other territories later in the year.</p><cite>&#8211; From Ledger&#8217;s firmware update note</cite></blockquote>



<p>Nano X, one of the company&#8217;s crypto hardware wallet products, is currently the only wallet compatible with the service. Users will have to pay a monthly subscription fee and provide a copy of their passport/national identity card to sign up for this service &#8211; a major point of contention for users. </p>



<p>The wallet maker has not yet published the firmware release notes, leaving the update&#8217;s implementation up for speculation till further notice.</p>



<h2>Community Uproar</h2>



<p>Some proponents were left unimpressed by the company&#8217;s decision. The main concerns were seemingly around requiring customers to provide an ID/passport, essentially doxxing users to third parties, and encouraging customers to back up their seed phrase online. </p>



<p>One Reddit user <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/13im3bc/wtf_ledger_this_is_a_disaster_waiting_to_happen/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/13im3bc/wtf_ledger_this_is_a_disaster_waiting_to_happen/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">pointed</a> out that distributing seed phrases to outside parties creates several points of failure and increases the risks of data leaks. The company previously suffered a massive exploit in July 2020 and the hacker <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2021/12/28/after-ledger-hack-who-can-you-trust-for-bitcoin-storage/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2021/12/28/after-ledger-hack-who-can-you-trust-for-bitcoin-storage/" rel="noreferrer noopener">dumped</a> personal information on over 270,000 customers on the internet, including their phone numbers and home addresses.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Update on the July data breach: despite the leak, your crypto assets are safe.<br>If truly and sincerely regrettable, this breach only concerns e-commerce related information. It has no link nor impact on our hardware wallets, the apps or your funds.<a href="https://t.co/K0M65DQCOl" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/K0M65DQCOl</a></p>&mdash; Pascal Gauthier @Ledger (@_pgauthier) <a href="https://twitter.com/_pgauthier/status/1341084660953194497?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">December 21, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Self-custody remains a hot-button topic in crypto, even more so after the failure of FTX crypto exchange. While some argue that <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ledger-hardware-wallet-amid-ftx-debacle/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ledger-hardware-wallet-amid-ftx-debacle/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ledger</a>&#8216;s latest recovery service puts users at risk, others insist that the option could help mitigate lost seed phrases and other self-custody risks. </p>

<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has responded to the petition for writ of mandamus filed by American crypto giant <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-launches-global-advisory-council/">Coinbase</a> last month. The petition was filed to compel the SEC to provide a yes or no answer to a previous request from Coinbase which urged the securities regulator to use its rulemaking process to provide guidance for the crypto industry. </p>



<h2><strong>SEC: Gary Gensler’s Public Statements Don’t Reflect Commission’s Stance</strong></h2>



<p>Paul Grewal, the Chief Legal Officer of Coinbase, took to Twitter earlier today to share the latest development in the intensifying legal battle between the crypto exchange and the SEC. Grewal revealed that the regulator’s response to its request for rulemaking for the crypto industry was a “resounding maybe.”. The SEC’s filing marked the first time it had formally explained its views on crypto regulation before the court. </p>

The securities regulator also called out the exchange for seeking the court’s help to compel it to act on the recently filed petition, citing that there were no statutes or regulations which required the Commission to act according to a specific timeline. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>That Coinbase would like its policy preferences addressed immediately does not entitle it to extraordinary relief ordering the Commission to act on a rulemaking petition that has been pending for well under a year.”</p><cite>Securities and Exchange Commission</cite></blockquote>



<p>According to Paul Grewal, the SEC has <a href="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1658271342863716352" rel="nofollow noopener">acknowledged</a> that it will continue to use enforcement actions as a substitute for rulemaking for the foreseeable future. However, the SEC has clarified that the information gathered from such enforcement actions could inform the Commission’s consideration of its regulatory approach for crypto assets. The SEC also advised the public to not consider public comments made by Chairman Gary Gensler as formal guidance or policy statements for the crypto industry.</p>

<ul><li>Court filings by the U.S. SEC claim that Jump Trading entered a secret deal with Do Kwon in 2021.&nbsp;</li><li>Jump Trading allegedly propped up Terraform Labs’ TerraUSD stablecoin a year before it collapsed.&nbsp;</li><li>The deal allowed TerraUSD to regain its dollar peg in 2021 in exchange for a discount on Luna purchases by Jump.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Chicago-based Jump Trading is once again in the crosshairs of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as recent court filings by the securities regulator highlight a secret deal between the high-frequency trading firm and the now defunct Terraform Labs involving the latter’s TerraUSD stablecoin.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Jump Trading Made Over $1 Billion After Secret Deal With Do Kwon</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/jump-trading-did-secret-deal-to-prop-up-terrausd-stablecoin-sec-says-11335951" rel="noopener">Wall Street Journal</a>, recent court filings made by the SEC as part of its ongoing fraud lawsuit against Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon confirmed that Jump Trading was the unnamed U.S. trading firm that was listed in the initial <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2023/comp-pr2023-32.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">complaint</a>. The complaint alleged that when the TerraUSD stablecoin lost its peg to the US Dollar in May 2021, Kwon and Terraform Labs entered into a secret deal with Jump Trading to prop up its price. As per said deal, Jump purchased large amounts of TerraUSD which drove up the stablecoin’s price and helped it regain its peg.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In exchange for helping restore TerraUSD’s peg, Terraform Labs allowed Jump to buy its Luna token at 30, 40, and 50 cents over the next three years. The agreed-upon price allowed Jump Trading to scoop up Luna tokens at a massive discount, which ultimately netted more than $1 billion for the trading firm. <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/jump-trading-sec-unnamed-firm-terra/">Reports</a> of Jump&#8217;s involvement with Terraform Labs’ started circulating earlier this year after the SEC filed charges against Do Kwon and his crypto firm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jump Trading’s role in helping TerraUSD regain its dollar pegs contradicts the claims made by Do Kwon about the stablecoin’s self-healing capability. The SEC has accused Kwon of making misleading statements about the capabilities of the stablecoin’s underlying algorithm while keeping investors in the dark about secret deals that actually propped up TerraUSD. As of now, Jump Trading has not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with the stablecoin or Terraform Labs’ collapse in May last year.</p>

<ul><li>BlockFi has planned to liquidate its crypto lending platform after determining that its the best course of action for creditors.</li><li>The bankrupt crypto lender’s decision comes after multiple unsuccessful attempts to sell the business.&nbsp;</li><li>The firm’s inability to secure a value-maximizing offer was blamed on the recent regulatory scrutiny of crypto entities.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>New Jersey-based <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/blockfi-custodial-account-300-million/">BlockFi</a> has announced its plans to liquidate its cryptocurrency lending platform following several unsuccessful attempts to sell the business. The bankrupt crypto lender has concluded that selling the lending business is the best course of action for its creditors and customers who have been stranded since November last year. </p>



<h2><strong>BlockFi’s Claims Against FTX &amp; Alameda Will Make a $1 Billion Difference</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/blockfi-moves-to-liquidate-its-crypto-lending-platform-ccd50083" rel="noopener">Wall Street Journal</a>, BlockFi has determined that selling the crypto lending platform will not generate enough value for the bankrupt firm’s creditors and customers. The firm laid out its reorganization plan in a recent <a href="https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/blockfi/Home-DocketInfo" rel="nofollow noopener">filing</a> made with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey. As per the court filing, the Chapter 11 reorganization plan has been sent to the bankrupt crypto lender’s creditors and over 100,000 retail customers for a vote. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We believe that our Plan is the fastest way for clients to receive the highest recovery of digital assets and conclude the Chapter 11 cases as quickly as possible.”</p><cite>Statement from BlockFi</cite></blockquote>



<p>BlockFi’s decision to initiate the self-liquidation transaction comes after back and forth with multiple potential buyers regarding a sale since January this year. The crypto lender found that a sale wouldn’t generate meaningful value for the creditors and that directly distributing assets after liquidation would extract more value for said creditors. The bankrupt crypto lender also cited the recent regulatory scrutiny of crypto entities as one of the reasons for not being able to secure a value-maximizing offer from prospective buyers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The amount that will be distributed to BlockFi’s creditors will depend on the outcome of pending litigation against its counterparties. The crypto lender has nearly $355 million frozen on the bankrupt crypto exchange FTX and an outstanding $671 million loan to FTX’s sister firm Alameda Research. The outcome of the lawsuits involving FTX and other counterparties, including Three Arrows Capital and crypto miner Core Scientific, will make a difference of over $1 billion in BlockFi’s recoveries and the subsequent repayment to its creditors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
