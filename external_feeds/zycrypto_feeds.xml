<p>Worldcoin, a cryptocurrency established by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, attracted some attention <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sam-altmans-crypto-project-worldcoin-targets-2-billion-users-with-worldwide-launch/">during its launch</a> this week. According to a report by Reuters, the UK&#8217;s privacy authority, the Information Commission Office (ICO), is looking into the launch stating that it has taken notice of the Worldcoin launch in the UK and will be conducting more research.</p>



<p>Additionally, it emphasized that organizations are required to conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment before processing any data that could be potentially harmful to the public, such as special category biometric data.</p>



<p>The Information Commission Office (ICO) is an independent organization that oversees data protection in the United Kingdom. It is tasked with protecting information rights and ensuring compliance with data protection legislation such as the Data Protection Act (DPA) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>



<p>The Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office can and has handed out hefty fines like the £20m ($25m) it fined British Airways for breaching data protection laws and processing the personal information of 400,000 customers without proper security procedures.</p>



<p>Worldcoin, the crypto project initiated by Open AI CEO Sam Altman, allows users to provide retina scans to receive digital identification and free cryptocurrency through their service. Worldcoin was launched on July 24 after an initial 2 million people joined the project in the beta phase.</p>



<p>However, it has received criticism, notably <a href="https://zycrypto.com/vitalik-buterin-raises-alarm-over-worldcoin-as-binance-and-other-crypto-exchanges-list-newly-launched-token/">from individuals like Vitalik Buterin</a>, who expressed concerns about the potential privacy implications of sharing personal information by scanning a person’s iris. Buterin makes the case that iris scanning can unintentionally reveal more information than is intended.</p>



<p>The Ethereum founder argues that anyone may check the Worldcoin database to determine if a World ID holder is in the system by scanning their iris and comparing the results.</p>



<p>Buterin is also concerned about the difficulty of obtaining an &#8220;Orb&#8221; device; as such World IDs won&#8217;t be available to everyone but mainly people living in larger cities.</p>



<p>Worldcoin said in a statement to CNBC that they would <em>“comply with all laws and regulations governing the processing of personal data in the markets where Worldcoin is available, including the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and the UK Data Protection Act. From its inception, Worldcoin was designed to protect individual privacy.” </em></p>



<p>According to Worldcoin, the project has built a solid privacy program and deployed a privacy-centric design. They said they had carried out an exhaustive Data Protection Impact Assessment and were immediately addressing requests from people to delete their data.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Worldcoin is trading at $2.19 according to data from CoinGecko, a long way off from the $3.30 it had reached after its launch just days ago.</p>

<p>In a recent interview with Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, he expressed immense satisfaction over the recent <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">partial victory in the court</a>. He called Judge Torres&#8217; decision a significant triumph for both Ripple and the crypto industry in the United States. The decision made public on July 13th, represented a turning point in the continuing lawsuit brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2020 against Ripple.</p>



<p>The main aim of the court&#8217;s decision was to make it clear that a digital token like XRP is not, by definition, an investment contract. Alderoty emphasized that evaluating the circumstances of the token&#8217;s sale and the relationship between the seller and the buyer is essential. He noted that a digital token does not represent a right, title, or interest in the company it is bought from, making it distinct from traditional stocks.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ripple-s-outlook-and-future-steps"><strong>Ripple&#8217;s Outlook and Future Steps</strong></h2>



<p>Despite the SEC&#8217;s potential plan to appeal the ruling, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-verdict-sec-appeal-could-actually-amplify-ripples-landmark-victory-clo-asserts/">Ripple remains unwavering</a> in its resolve to fight for its legal victory. Alderoty expressed confidence that a Court of Appeal would not only affirm the ruling but could strengthen it further.</p>



<p>Regarding the following steps, Alderoty outlined some unresolved issues concerning sales to institutional buyers. The court is yet to determine whether Ripple&#8217;s executives played any role in aiding and abetting those sales. However, the recent ruling&#8217;s findings and legal opinions remain unchanged and establish the law of the land, according to Alderoty.</p>



<p>Throughout the interview, Alderoty highlighted the importance of a comprehensive regulatory framework for the crypto industry in the United States. He stated that the SEC&#8217;s approach of labelling everything as a security is misguided and leads to uncertainty in the market. Instead, he emphasized the need for rational and understandable regulations that protect consumers, foster innovation, and ensure market integrity.</p>



<p>Alderoty pointed out that the lack of a clear and supportive regulatory environment has pushed Ripple to establish offices in various countries, including Singapore, the UK, Dubai, Brazil, and Ireland. He asserted that the U.S. must work on a comprehensive policy solution to prevent further lagging behind other countries in adopting crypto-friendly regulations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-looking-ahead-the-impact-of-the-court-s-ruling"><strong>Looking Ahead: The Impact of the Court&#8217;s Ruling</strong></h2>



<p>The court&#8217;s decision gave Ripple cause to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/u-s-banks-could-be-exploring-xrp-for-cross-border-payments-following-ripples-legal-victory/">celebrate its triumph</a> and has wider ramifications for the U.S. crypto market. Alderoty thinks the decision makes it very apparent that an asset, such as a digital token, cannot be immediately regarded as a contract for investment. Instead, attention should be paid to who are the parties involved in the trade and the actual manner in which an asset is traded.</p>



<p>Alderoty suggested that this ruling may resonate well in other cases, such as the ongoing Coinbase and Binance cases, as it firmly establishes that the SEC&#8217;s jurisdiction extends only to securities. He stressed that while retail purchasers of digital assets deserve protection, there are alternative mechanisms to provide such safeguards without making everything a security.</p>



<p>When asked about the primary regulator for the crypto industry, Alderoty acknowledged the complexity of the question. Rather than focusing on who holds power, he urged for a shift towards finding the best regulatory framework that ensures market integrity, consumer protection, and a conducive environment for crypto innovation.</p>

<p>The development team behind <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-ecosystem-developments-are-blowing-up-as-shib-whales-activity-soar-ahead-of-shibarium-launch/">Shiba Inu</a> has announced a major advancement in the SHIB ecosystem. A bridge between the soon-to-be-launched Shiba Inu-based layer-2 solution Shibarium and Ethereum is now live for public testing.</p>



<p>This addition to the Shibarium network was first announced in April and has since progressed from being partially functional to being available for public use.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-revolutionary-shibarium-bridge-is-now-online-for-testing"><strong>Revolutionary Shibarium Bridge Is Now Online For Testing</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/LucieSHIB/status/1684252125704880131">According to</a> SHIB marketing specialist Lucie, the bridge between Shibarium and Ethereum has been launched in beta for public testing.</p>



<p>The Shibarium bridge, which uses both Plasma and proof-of-stake technology, will initially support testnet ETH and is expected to take up to 30 minutes for each transfer. The bridge is also envisioned to serve as a solution for scaling, an indispensable aspect for any blockchain network striving to handle huge transaction volumes without compromising speed or efficiency.</p>



<p><em>“Moving between two large-scale blockchain networks requires a secure and robust cross-chain bridge, and Shibarium has achieved this by utilizing both Plasma and PoS security to create a trustless and bi-directional transaction environment between Shibarium and Ethereum.”</em></p>



<p>As it is currently in Beta, Lucie has warned investors against using real tokens on the cross-chain bridge. Lucie also reminded users to always exercise caution and verify authenticity before connecting their crypto wallets to any website to avoid getting scammed and losing all their real digital assets.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-shiba-inu-price-major-boom-ahead"><strong>Shiba Inu Price: Major Boom Ahead?</strong></h2>



<p>Lucie <a href="https://twitter.com/LucieSHIB/status/1674723004012544002">highlighted </a>the advantages of Shibarium last month, including its effect on the project’s gas fee token Bone ShibaSwap (BONE), as well as the SHIB token. The slashed gas fees on Shibarium could propel the prices of these tokens as demand and potential value increase.</p>



<p>Unlike another popular meme coin Dogecoin, which runs on its blockchain, Shiba Inu is an ERC-20 token built atop Ethereum. This implies the Dogecoin killer is also subject to the Ethereum network’s development decisions.</p>



<p>With a market cap of over $4.8 billion, Shiba Inu is currently the world’s 14th biggest cryptocurrency. The SHIB price is expected to blast off after <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-monster-move-draws-near-amid-imminent-launch-of-shibarium-in-august/">Shibarium goes live</a> on the mainnet as the layer-2 network will transform the meme coin into a comprehensive ecosystem. Shiba Inu bulls anticipate the day SHIB will see a meteoric rise to the elusive $0.001 mark and eventually topple Dogecoin.</p>

<p>Digital asset manager Grayscale’s lawyers have urged the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to give the green light to all spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications together.</p>



<p>The legal counsel made the call through a comment letter <a href="https://grayscale.com/grayscales-latest-gbtc-comment-letter/">submitted </a>on Thursday. This comes at a time when the company is locked in a lawsuit against the regulator over the rejection of its spot Bitcoin ETF application.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-grayscale-calls-for-spot-etf-approval"><strong>Grayscale Calls For Spot ETF Approval</strong></h2>



<p>Grayscale has argued that the SEC should give the regulatory blessing to all spot Bitcoin ETF applications at the same time if it approves any.</p>



<p>“The SEC’s actions related to bitcoin ETFs should be done in a fair and orderly manner,” Grayscale’s Chief Legal Officer Craig Salm posited in a statement. “As a disclosure-based regulator, the SEC should not pick winners and losers.”</p>



<p>The SEC is currently examining applications for spot ETFs from prominent fund managers, including <a href="https://zycrypto.com/approval-incoming-sec-officially-acknowledges-blackrocks-spot-bitcoin-etf-application/">BlackRock</a>, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/11-1-trillion-giant-fidelity-renews-push-for-spot-bitcoin-etf/">Fidelity</a>, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ark-invest-gains-edge-in-spot-bitcoin-etf-race-with-epic-surveillance-sharing-maneuver/">Ark Invest</a>, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bullish-btc-signal-sec-formally-accepts-valkyrie-spot-bitcoin-etf-filing-for-review/">Valkyrie</a>, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-etfs-in-motion-an-analysis-of-open-spot-btc-etf-applications-in-the-market/">WisdomTree</a>, and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/vaneck-takes-another-shot-at-introducing-spot-bitcoin-etf/">VanEck</a>. The regulator has basically struck down all applications for more than a decade over concerns of potential fraud and manipulation.</p>



<p>It has also previously rejected a proposal from Grayscale to convert its flagship GBTC fund into a spot Bitcoin ETF but has approved a number of futures-based Bitcoin ETFs. The investment firm has <a href="https://zycrypto.com/grayscale-flips-the-script-and-sues-the-sec-after-spot-bitcoin-etf-plan-rejection/">taken the SEC to court</a> over repeated refusals to list a spot Bitcoin ETF, saying the regulator was acting arbitrarily by failing to apply consistent treatment to similar investment vehicles.</p>



<p><em>“The SEC is already in a position to approve spot BTC ETFs based on its previous approval of Bitcoin futures ETFs. BTC’s spot and futures markets are inextricably linked (as evidenced by third-party studies showing 99% correlation),” Salm postulated.</em></p>



<p>Grayscale indicated it is more than willing to work with regulators to get its spot ETF greenlighted. “We will also take any action necessary to convert GBTC to an ETF.”</p>



<p>Salm added that if it’s converted to an ETF, it will return billions in value to investors, noting there’s “simply no reason” the SEC should keep GBTC investors from a spot Bitcoin ETF.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-surveillance-sharing-agreements-with-coinbase-might-not-meet-sec-s-standards"><strong>Surveillance-Sharing Agreements With Coinbase Might Not Meet SEC’s Standards</strong></h2>



<p>BlackRock, ARK Invest, and other asset managers have since modified their applications to address the SEC’s concerns. These firms now have Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the United States, as their surveillance-sharing partner.</p>



<p>Grayscale, however, poured cold water on the so-called surveillance-sharing agreements with Coinbase, arguing that it&#8217;s “not a new idea” and may not satisfy the SEC’s requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“Without disputing the usefulness of information obtainable under a surveillance-sharing agreement with a spot bitcoin trading venue, we believe the Commission’s prior decisions have already determined that such an agreement with a venue lacking compulsory investigative authority and oversight by a comprehensive market regulator does not satisfy Section 6(b)(5) in the absence of a surveillance-sharing agreement with a market of significant size that, like the CME bitcoin futures market, the Commission deems sufficiently ‘regulated.’”</em></p>



<p>Whether the SEC’s ultimate approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF is prompted by a court order or “evolution in their position on the matter,” Salm asserted it should be done “in a way that’s fair for all investors and issuers.”</p>

<p>The Shiba Inu (SHIB) community is abuzz with excitement after the team behind the project launched an official YouTube channel for the upcoming layer two protocol Shibarium.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, “LUCIE”, a key member of the network&#8217;s marketing team, wrote on Twitter “, <em>We are cooking something”,</em> encouraging members to subscribe to the new channel. Notably, since the announcement on Monday, the channel has grown from around 500 subscribers to almost 2,500 at press time.</p>



<p>The channel features five brief videos illustrating concepts such as “Shibarium Basic Information” and “Shibarium Technology L2 with $BONE as gas fee token”. A fourth video even offers a more comprehensive insight into the workings of Shibarium. While not much has been revealed about the channel, the community is stoked at the development, indicating potential insights into the upcoming Shibarium launch.</p>



<p>This cryptic announcement aligns with previous promises made by Shytoshi Kusama, the lead developer of Shiba Inu, who unveiled the Summer of Shibarium, assuring the community of strategic releases and updates in the pipeline. These initiatives are paving the way for the highly anticipated mainnet <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-monster-move-draws-near-amid-imminent-launch-of-shibarium-in-august/">launch of Shibarium</a>, scheduled to take place during the upcoming Blockchain Futurist Conference in August.</p>



<p>Notably, Lucie&#8217;s previous assurance that numerous projects will join the Shiba Inu ecosystem upon the L2 scaling solution&#8217;s integration into the mainnet has further fueled optimism among the community. These upcoming developments are expected to expand the project&#8217;s ecosystem beyond its current tokens, encompassing SHIB, BONE, and LEASH.</p>



<p>However, despite the positive sentiments and upcoming developments, SHIB&#8217;s price has not witnessed a significant rally lately. Since breaking crucial support at $0.000008 earlier last month, the second-largest meme coin by market capitalization has been trading in a consolidation. At the time of reporting, SHIB was trading at $0.000007801, up 1.06% in the past 24 hours and 1.48% in the past week.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, despite the present market conditions, experts in the field are optimistic about the potential impact of Shibarium&#8217;s mainnet launch on SHIB and other ecosystem tokens, including BONE and LEASH. Notably, a newly launched metric by onchain data analysis firm IntoTheBlock shows SHIB is becoming more popular, especially to newcomers, with the growth leaping from 25% in mid-April to just over 60% this week.</p>



<p>SHIB whales have also been making moves ahead of the Shibarium launch. On Tuesday, several whales moved close to 50 billion SHIB between exchanges and wallets, with a single entity transferring almost just over 2.4 trillion SHIB (worth 18 million) in one transaction recently. While these types of transfers often cause anxiety among market participants due to the possibility of a dump, SHIB has remained fairly stable, signalling they are accumulating more or just holding, according to popular crypto analyst Austin Hilton.</p>



<p>With <a href="https://zycrypto.com/0-001-shib-price-beckons-as-shiba-inu-ecosystem-flares-with-massive-activity-ahead-of-shibarium-launch/">Shibarium&#8217;s mainnet launch drawing nearer</a>, Shibarium&#8217;s YouTube channel is set to serve as a vital platform for sharing information about upcoming developments.</p>

<p>After Elon Musk changed Twitter’s official name to X Holdings Corp in April, he decided that finally, the time had come to go all in and change the app’s name itself. In a productive weekend, Musk who had bought Twitter for $44bn in October 2022, announced that the X logo would go ahead.</p>



<p><em>“And soon we shall bid adieu to the Twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds.” Musk said.</em></p>



<p>Twitter’s advertisement money has been declining since Musk took over and he has since voiced plans for a complete revamp of the popular social media site into an everything app, including payments.</p>



<p>Twitter CEO, Linda Yaccarino confirmed the re-branding, stating “X will be the platform that can deliver, well … everything [a] global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities”.</p>



<p>Musk explained the move, saying that Twitter did not have the right ethos and therefore a reboot of the whole platform was needed.</p>



<p>Musk stated in an interview that X could eventually include &#8220;half of the global financial system&#8221; by providing banking, payment, and other financial services. The potential of X has been compared to WeChat and other apps in China. Since buying Twitter for $44 billion in October 2022, Musk has pushed for the network to provide financial services.</p>



<p>This has led to some speculations as to how Musk and Yaccarino plan to accomplish financial services inclusion. As the name “X” suggests a connection to XRP or XLM, some have raised hopes that either one or perhaps both of these cryptocurrencies may be integrated into the platform.</p>



<p>XRP, which won clarity in a landmark decision by Judge Torres less than two weeks ago, is now the only cryptocurrency to have regulatory clarity. However, others believe that it will be <a href="https://zycrypto.com/dogecoin-jumps-past-cardano-amid-hopes-twitters-x-rebrand-will-introduce-a-doge-payment-option/">Dogecoin that will be used as payment on X</a>.</p>



<p>Incidentally, it was only last April that Musk temporarily changed the then-Twitter logo and replaced it with the Dogecoin symbol, which at that time caused the meme-coin to rise by 20%.</p>



<p>Well-known Real-Vision CEO and Investor Raoul Pal said <em>“Two things I’ve said when Elon bought &#8220;X&#8221;: Elon bought it for the AI, and the free speech angle is to give it an unbiased model. He needs the AI to train the Optimus robot. He will use crypto to be able to make global payments for creators etc. My guess is he uses Doge.”</em></p>



<p>Elon Musk has long been known for his affection for what he calls the “people’s crypto” and has caused price surges of Dogecoin in the past. While Dogecoin has rallied by 19% since the re-branding of Twitter into X, it remains to be seen how the story unfolds and whether X will incorporate Dogecoin or any other cryptocurrency into its new payment rails.</p>

<p>A recent court verdict that Ripple’s XRP is not a security has drawn the ire of U.S. Congressman and crypto skeptic Brad Sherman.</p>



<p>Sherman, who is no stranger to controversy among crypto circles, called the ruling “ridiculous”.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rep-sherman-labels-ripple-court-verdict-ridiculous"><strong>Rep Sherman Labels Ripple Court Verdict “Ridiculous”</strong></h2>



<p>A U.S. lawmaker has criticized the Ripple court decision, a stance that will ruffle the feathers of XRP enthusiasts.</p>



<p>On July 13, 2023, Judge Analisa Torres of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">ordered </a>that XRP should not be considered a security when sold on retail digital asset exchanges in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) case against Ripple. However, the Judge said the institutional sale of the XRP token did violate federal securities laws.</p>



<p>While the digital asset industry welcomed the partial victory, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) is not a fan of the landmark judgment. The California-based accountant turned politician said during a congressional hearing on Wednesday that XRP is always a security. This is contrary to the court’s interpretation of XRP’s complex nature as both a crypto asset and a technology for real-time, economical remittances.</p>



<p>Sherman, who currently serves as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Investor Protection and Capital Markets, also shared his view on the uses of cryptocurrencies, claiming that they mostly serve bad actors seeking to evade taxes or commit fraudulent activities. The Congressman further cautioned against the illegal uses of cryptocurrency, stressing concerns regarding human trafficking and sanction violations.</p>



<p>In Sherman’s view, the word &#8220;cryptocurrency&#8221; indicates hidden money, which becomes second-fiddle to even the Uruguayan peso once its hidden element is eliminated.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sherman-tackles-crypto"><strong>Sherman Tackles Crypto</strong></h2>



<p>This isn’t the first time Brad Sherman has taken a hard line on crypto.</p>



<p>The Congressman, who once said that all Bitcoin does is allow “a few dozen men in my district to sit in their pajamas on their couch all day and tell their wives they are going to be millionaires,&#8221; has previously drawn public criticism for some of his more audacious statements about crypto assets.</p>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/BradSherman/status/1669076493861888002">Speaking </a>to <em>CNBC </em>recently, Sherman was questioned on whether the current regulatory enforcement actions suggested the end of cryptocurrencies in America. &#8220;I hope so, don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; was his concise answer.</p>



<p>In the Wednesday Congressional hearing, Sherman also likened the pseudonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto to Charles Ponzi, the notorious Italian swindler famous for the Ponzi scheme.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the SEC is mulling <a href="https://zycrypto.com/potential-sec-appeal-in-ripple-lawsuit-not-a-blow-to-xrp-legal-expert-reveals-why/">launching an appeal </a>of the split-decision XRP ruling in the courts as it believes it was flawed.</p>

<p>Singapore’s High Court has ruled that crypto assets are considered property and can be held on trust in a case involving Seychelles-headquartered exchange Bybit and a former contractor. This marks a notable step in the legal classification of digital assets in Singapore.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-singapore-declares-crypto-is-property"><strong>Singapore Declares Crypto Is Property</strong></h2>



<p>Judge Philip Jeyaretnam of the High Court of Singapore ruled on Tuesday that cryptocurrency is a form of property.</p>



<p>The judge dismissed any differences between crypto, fiat money, or shells, noting that all those objects, physical or not, derive their value from mutual faith in them. Crypto assets, despite their lack of physical presence, were deemed “things in action,” a term in British common law describing a type of property over which personal rights are capable of being enforced in court.</p>



<p>“We identify what is going on as a particular digital token, somewhat like how we give a name to a river even though the water contained within its banks is constantly changing,” he observed.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-genesis-of-the-case"><strong>Genesis Of The Case</strong></h2>



<p>The judgment was made in a case involving the Bybit cryptocurrency exchange and a former employee who allegedly breached her employment contract by transferring more than 4.2 million Tether (USDT) to her personal addresses. It was believed that Ms. Ho went on a spending spree after receiving the funds, purchasing a freehold penthouse apartment with her husband, a brand-new car, and multiple Louis Vuitton products.</p>



<p>Like any other thing in action, USDT is capable of being held on trust,” Judge Jeyaretnam ruled.</p>



<p>The judge further dismissed the common belief that crypto assets have no “real” value, concluding that value is “a judgment made by an aggregate of human minds.”</p>



<p>Judge Jeyaretnam referenced the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/singapore-financial-regulator-seeks-stakeholder-input-on-proposals-for-digital-payments/">consultation paper</a> by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) in her decision. The paper outlined potential requirements for segregation and custody of digital payment tokens, declaring that if digital assets can be practically identified and segregated, they could be legally held on trust.</p>



<p>The ruling also cites Order 22 of Singapore’s Rules of Court 2021, which includes crypto or other digital currency, cash, debt, a cash balance at a bank, bonds, shares, and other securities, in the definition of “movable property”.</p>



<p>The court has now ordered Ho, who accused a non-present cousin “Jason Teo” of gaining unauthorized access to her work laptop and controlling the relevant addresses, to return the assets to Bybit.</p>

<p>Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr has not shied away from controversy nor discussing views that might not be aligned with mainstream narratives. One such topic: Bitcoin (BTC).</p>



<p>Kennedy has admitted he is a Bitcoin bag holder, contradicting his earlier denial during a Miami conference. He claimed he took the money from his Monsanto case check and acquired 2 Bitcoins for each of his 7 children.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rfk-jr-purchased-bitcoin-for-his-kids"><strong>RFK Jr. Purchased Bitcoin For His Kids</strong></h2>



<p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has finally confirmed owning Bitcoin.</p>



<p>The presidential candidate made the confirmation during a Twitter Spaces conversation with Scott Melker, a popular trader and podcast host known as “The Wolf of All Streets. Kennedy spoke in depth about how investments in crypto assets have the ability to pull the poor out of poverty.</p>



<p>In his opinion, Bitcoin lets small investors have an inflation-proof currency that is censorship-resistant and gives them freedom, unlike holding fiat currencies which are at the mercy of the system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Robert, whose family is political royalty, then dropped the bombshell. The 69-year-old said he had “decided to put my money where my mouth is and bought two bitcoin for each of my seven children” right after the Miami Bitcoin conference held in May this year.</p>



<p>Kennedy <a href="https://zycrypto.com/pro-crypto-presidential-candidate-robert-kennedy-jr-lauds-bitcoin-throws-shade-at-oppressive-cbdcs/">made history</a> in May 2023 by becoming the first presidential candidate to announce that his campaign would accept donations in Bitcoin. However, he told revelers in Miami that he did not have any exposure to the classic cryptocurrency and that his endorsement of the asset was not investment advice. Nonetheless, a financial <a href="https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/editorialfiles/2023/07/07/Candidate_Report_RFK_Jr.pdf">document </a>obtained by <em>CNBC </em>showed that Kennedy held up to $250,000 worth of Bitcoin.</p>



<p>RFK Jr. recently <a href="https://zycrypto.com/crypto-booster-robert-f-kennedy-jr-promises-to-use-bitcoin-to-stabilize-us-dollar-if-he-becomes-president/">announced a bold plan to back the U.S. dollar with Bitcoin </a>and exempt BTC from capital gains tax. The nephew of former president John F. Kennedy is among a cadre of pro-crypto hopefuls that spans Republican Senator <a href="https://zycrypto.com/u-s-senator-ted-cruz-bought-as-much-as-50000-bitcoin-during-the-latest-crypto-market-meltdown/">Ted Cruz</a> and other presidential candidates like Florida governor <a href="https://zycrypto.com/no-cbdc-in-florida-asserts-pro-crypto-governor/">Ron DeSantis</a>.</p>

<p>Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market have held steady following the Federal Reserve’s announcement today that the central bank has hiked its benchmark interest rates by 25 basis points, bringing them to their highest level since 2001.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-25-5-50-range"><strong>5.25%-5.50% Range</strong></h2>



<p>The U.S. Federal Reserve is pushing on its war against inflation.</p>



<p>The central bank announced today during the Federal Open Market Committee that it would be raising federal interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point.</p>



<p>The move, which aligned with market expectations, raises rates to a range of 5.25%-5.50%. This is the highest the federal funds rate has been in 22 years. In so doing, the bank increases the cost of borrowing, which strengthens the dollar&#8217;s value.</p>



<p>Today’s rate hike is a resumption of tightener monetary conditions by the Federal Reserve, which at its last meeting in June had halted what had then been a 15-month cycle of successive rate hikes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rate-hike-offers-bitcoin-bulls-little-fuel"><strong>Rate Hike Offers Bitcoin Bulls Little Fuel</strong></h2>



<p>Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value, was at the time of writing trading for $29,512 — a 0.9% increase over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data. It’s now down 57.09% from its all-time high of $69,044.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ether, the second biggest crypto asset, was up 0.7% over the same timeframe, trading hands for $1,882.87. ETH is down 61.38% from its peak of $4,878, while many other altcoins have fared much worse over the past year.</p>



<p>At his post-meeting press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell revealed that the central bank was still committed to bringing down inflation — which currently hovers at 3% — to 2%. Notably, inflation in the U.S. stood at over 9% a year ago.</p>



<p>&#8220;We’ve covered a lot of ground, and the full effects of our tightening are yet to be felt,&#8221; Powell noted. &#8220;Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2%.&#8221;</p>



<p>Chair Powell further indicated no decisions regarding the pace of future rate hikes or pauses had been made. He added that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) would “assess the need for further tightening” on a “meeting by meeting” basis and further said he doesn&#8217;t expect inflation to drop to 2% until 2025.</p>

<p>OG meme coin Dogecoin has overtaken Cardano in terms of market capitalization as investors scoop up DOGE in hopes of the token playing a bigger role on Twitter, which rebranded as “everything app” X on July 24.</p>



<p>At the time of publication, DOGE was up around 2.5% in the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko, changing hands for $0.0789. And in the past week, it&#8217;s up 13.8%, making it the best-performing coin among the top 10 cryptocurrencies. Cardano (ADA), on the other hand, has lost 4.5% over the last seven days, with its market cap falling below Dogecoin&#8217;s.</p>



<p>Cryptic tweets from Twitter owner Elon Musk fueled the Dogecoin upsurge. On Tuesday, Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1683877911315599360">tweeted </a>a promo of the social media giant’s new logo — which was originally shared by a Dogecoin designer — and also added the Dogecoin ticker logo to the location field in his Twitter bio.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Anyone else notice the Dogecoin (Ɖ) symbol in Elon Musks location <a href="https://t.co/Y1OGT42hD2">pic.twitter.com/Y1OGT42hD2</a></p>&mdash; Morgan (@Helloimmorgan) <a href="https://twitter.com/Helloimmorgan/status/1683607928169742336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 24, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Musk adding Dogecoin’s symbol to his bio reignited rumours DOGE may soon be used for payments on X, given the eccentric billionaire’s infatuation with the meme coin.</p>



<p>Such speculations aren’t completely unfounded. Last April, Musk <a href="https://zycrypto.com/elon-musks-proposal-to-add-dogecoin-payments-for-twitter-blue-puts-a-meteoric-rally-into-play-for-doge/">hinted </a>at making dogecoin a payment mechanism for Twitter Blue, the site’s subscription service with premium features. His EV maker Tesla already <a href="https://zycrypto.com/tesla-boots-bitcoin-but-retains-once-joke-crypto-dogecoin-as-a-means-of-payment/">accepts DOGE payments</a> for merch purchases. Musk also teased Dogecoin payments for his other enterprises, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/with-spacex-poised-to-accept-dogecoin-payments-for-merch-soon-will-doge-get-its-glory-back/">SpaceX </a>and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/elon-musk-drops-major-signal-about-spacexs-starlink-accepting-dogecoin-payments-after-tesla/">Starlink</a>. </p>



<p>If Dogecoin is indeed integrated into X’s payment infrastructure, the cryptocurrency could see a bull breather and possibly surge to new record highs.</p>



<p>But Musk’s fondness for Dogecoin has attracted some negative attention. In June last year, a group of beleaguered Dogecoin investors <a href="https://zycrypto.com/dogefather-elon-musk-slapped-with-mammoth-258-billion-lawsuit-for-allegedly-pumping-dogecoin/">lodged a $258 billion class action suit</a> against Musk, Tesla, and SpaceX. The complaint accuses the self-proclaimed Dogefather of operating a pyramid scheme to pump Dogecoin’s price “more than 36,000% over two years and then letting it crash”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Musk’s lawyers have <a href="https://zycrypto.com/elon-musk-tesla-want-258-billion-dogecoin-case-dismissed/">requested </a>a United States judge to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing that it&#8217;s a “fanciful work of fiction”.</p>

<p>Dogecoin whales have made a significant splash in the crypto market in recent weeks, acquiring $225 million worth of DOGE coins, according to data from the on-chain analytics platform IntoTheBlock.</p>



<p>Crypto analyst Ali Martinez brought attention to this astounding purchase on Tuesday, stating that these whales bought around 3 billion DOGE in the last three weeks alone.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2oki2oWciUsA_WGY2eylDhQxKxkGGBe1bkiv35STuIoGNCF_ae09_yQ-4cgEahKCzspghu4bTODi8yM7fjYLzijEVRPH8PG01YBjwbiDOhvZZOrX7Xz7n0Gb6BQuYXue26PkE9buDrsqVuDX0Res1Q" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The surge in Dogecoin acquisitions comes amidst a bullish price outlook, driven further by influential figures such as Elon Musk. The billionaire tech entrepreneur has been a vocal supporter of Dogecoin, often causing notable price fluctuations with his tweets. Musk&#8217;s recent strategic move on Twitter has amplified the buzz around Dogecoin.</p>



<p>On Monday, he revamped Twitter&#8217;s logo, replacing the iconic blue bird with an &#8220;X&#8221; symbol. Musk updated his Twitter bio to display the Dogecoin symbol alongside this change, further cementing his backing of the meme-inspired cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>This move did not go unnoticed in the crypto community, leading to speculation about the potential integration of Dogecoin into the Twitter platform. Given Musk&#8217;s history of publicly endorsing DOGE, many believe his actions hint at the possibility of utilizing Dogecoin as a tipping currency for the app. As a result, investors rushed to capitalize on the positive sentiment, resulting in an immediate 9% surge in Dogecoin&#8217;s price.</p>



<p>Musk&#8217;s interest in cryptocurrencies is no secret. After acquiring Twitter for a staggering $44 billion last year, he merged it into his privately-held corporation, X Corp. In October 2022, Musk expressed his vision of creating an &#8220;everything app&#8221; with the acquisition, and now, his recent Twitter bio update has only fueled speculation of potential <a href="https://zycrypto.com/tesla-boots-bitcoin-but-retains-once-joke-crypto-dogecoin-as-a-means-of-payment/">Dogecoin integration</a>.</p>



<p>Cryptocurrency analysts have also been observing these developments closely. Popular crypto analyst Kaleo “@Cryptokaleo” weighed in, suggesting that Musk&#8217;s inclusion of Dogecoin in his bio alongside the X rebranding may not be a mere coincidence. The pundit believed that Musk might reveal his plans for integrating DOGE into the X app in the coming days or weeks. </p>



<p>Kaleo also emphasized the importance of being patient with DOGE, noting that the charts continue to indicate positive trends even after a minor correction.</p>



<p><em>“In the meantime, Dogecoin cools off a bit and catches up with the blood we’re seeing across the rest of the market. Why? People are impatient and they want immediate results. Rumours and hope only holds up for so long in a bear market. So, I think it’s a pretty solid move to continue to accumulate on any dips we get from here. The charts continue to look great and should even after a minor correction. Just gotta be a little patient,”</em> wrote Kaleo.</p>



<p>At press time, DOGE was trading at 0.079, up just over 2% in the past 24 hours. In the past 48 hours, the top meme cryptocurrency has toppled Cardano to become the seven largest coin by market capitalization.</p>

<p>Stuart Alderoty, legal chief at Ripple, has dismissed concerns about a likely appeal by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to the historic XRP ruling earlier this month. Alderoty said the company is prepared in the event of an appeal by the SEC. In fact, he believes such a move could see the company further consolidate its win over the watchdog.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ripple-legal-team-not-backing-down"><strong>Ripple Legal Team Not Backing Down</strong></h2>



<p>The SEC recently <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-prepares-to-challenge-ripple-court-victory-heres-what-this-could-mean-for-xrp/">suggested </a>that it was mulling an appeal of the Ripple ruling, as per a filing in the ongoing legal brawl against Terraform Labs and its founder, Do Kwon.</p>



<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/25/ripple-sec-ruling-xrp/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHMyPy3fSfi6xX_qhmJRWm4FS9DTNFf-LVivQ7bwS2fjTRbjm7aOhDIOdqB2E22TLA6Y5_uuHVFjMv8ShxkyGpoCCt6_FBNvM4CA64M7I0NwXUATJnQ34-3dqXmjw-TgBtI7Sm9Q0c9PJiER6HBeQbqYc2Nn_lAmd9sJYv2Tq8cO">Speaking </a>on the TechCrunch podcast on Wednesday, Ripple’s chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty maintained that XRP is not an investment contract and that the Ripple legal team would not back down from an appeal initiated in the court by the SEC.</p>



<p>“We think the judge got that right, and we think that was a faithful application of the law, and I think a court of appeals will not only affirm that but maybe even amplify that to even a greater extent.”</p>



<p>Federal district judge Analisa Torres <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">ruled </a>on July 13 that XRP, the token that powers Ripple’s payments network, is “not necessarily a security on its face”, except for instances when it was offered to hedge funds and other institutional buyers. This was largely considered a glorious triumph for Ripple and the crypto industry at large.</p>



<p>Last week, the SEC expressed its displeasure with the verdict and hinted that it would later challenge it. “SEC staff is considering the various avenues that are available for further review and intends to recommend that the SEC seek such review,” the agency’s lawyers noted.</p>



<p>Alderoty further forecasted that the SEC would begin losing ongoing cases where it attempts to contend that crypto assets are securities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Our case and the decision rendered by our judge [Torres] will comfort other judges that the SEC is just misguided.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although Ripple’s win in court lifted a regulatory cloud that had hung over the project for years, Alderoty noted that the coast is still not clear regarding where crypto stands in the eyes of U.S. law. The CLO also criticized the SEC’s regulation-by-enforcement approach that has effectively stifled crypto in America.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We still need a rational, comprehensive, and understandable regulatory framework for crypto in the U.S.,” Alderoty posited. “Because of the SEC’s refusal to faithfully apply the law […] the U.S. has been visibly falling behind the rest of the world.”</p>



<p>The price of XRP sits above $0.70 as of this writing, according to data from <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/xrp">CoinGecko</a>, marking a 0.4% increase over the last 24 hours.</p>

<p>At the start of the week, Twitter ditched the bird logo for X in a rebrand that has sent the community buzzing, but amid the chatter, Dogecoin (DOGE) has ridden the wave to go on a strong rally.</p>



<p>Within hours of the rebrand, DOGE climbed by 8% to trade at $0.0771 after weeks of seemingly inactivity. The rally puts DOGE as the seventh largest virtual currency, with a market capitalization of $10.8 billion above Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL).</p>



<p>The meme coin began its rally after Twitter’s owner Elon Musk added Dogecoin’s logo to his bio minutes after the rebrand. The move triggered a wave of speculation among community members that DOGE will play a significant role in the newly rebranded micro-blogging site and possibly go up to the much-coveted $1 price.</p>



<p>It is widely expected that DOGE will serve as the primary means of payment in the new “everything app” X, a sentiment shared across the digital asset community since Musk took over the platform. Given the success of the Bitcoin (BTC) tipping feature, Dogecoin’s community is rippling with enthusiasm that a similar feature will be rolled out on the platform leveraging the meme coin.</p>



<p>In the weeks leading up to the rebrand, Dogecoin whales have steadily bolstered their holdings. Data from IntoTheBlock indicates that whales snagged up 3 billion DOGE worth $225 million, laying the foundation for a future surge for the token.</p>



<p>Musk has been nursing ambitions to transform Twitter into a super app in the same mould as the Chinese social media platform WeChat. Musk enlisted the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/doge-floki-go-ballistic-after-elon-musk-teases-new-twitter-ceo/">services</a> of Linda Yaccarino in May to serve as the platform’s CEO to bring his vision to reality, making X the default app for mobile users.</p>



<p><em>“If you’re China, you kind of live on WeChat, it does everything,”</em> said Musk.<em> “It’s sort of like Twitter, plus PayPal, plus a whole bunch of other things. And all rolled into one.”</em></p>



<p>Musk is no stranger to jarring changes since taking over the reins at Twitter with the Tesla CEO increasing the number of premium users on the app, cracking down on bots, and laying off a chunk of employees.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-not-the-only-one-riding-the-wave">Not the only one riding the wave</h2>



<p>DOGE is not the only virtual currency riding the wave of Twitter’s rebrand to embark on a rally. A cross-section of XRP’s community interpreted the X rebrand as a nod to their “<a href="https://zycrypto.com/potential-sec-appeal-in-ripple-lawsuit-not-a-blow-to-xrp-legal-expert-reveals-why/">victory</a>” over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>



<p>Barely hours after the rebrand, virtual currency investors sunk funds into an unrelated X token, sending prices up by over 2,000%. X, the native token of the X NFT marketplace, surged on the backs of the rebrand, with speculators hoping to make a quick buck.</p>



<p>Other assets failed to latch onto the wave, with BTC falling below the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/is-bitcoin-eyeing-new-highs-by-holding-the-30-5k-zone/">$30,000</a> mark and SOL slumping by over 10%. Ethereum (ETH) and Polygon (MATIC) recorded their fair share of losses in what experts speculate to be a long week for the ecosystem.</p>
