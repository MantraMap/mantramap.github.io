<li>The pair must clear $17.00 and $17.78 to continue higher in the near term.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Solana price is trading above $16.00 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-bulls-in-control-above-29500/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a>. SOL could start a strong increase if it clears the $17.78 resistance.</em></p>
<h2>Solana (SOL) Price Analysis</h2>
<p>SOL price started a decent recovery wave above the $15 pivot level. The price formed a base and was able to climb above the $15.50 and $16.00 levels.</p>
<p>There was a clear move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the key drop from the $22.32 swing high to the $13.20 low. The bulls were even able to pump the price above the $16.50 resistance zone. However, the bears were active near the $17.78 resistance.</p>
<p>The price struggled to surpass the 50% Fib retracement level of the key drop from the $22.32 swing high to the $13.20 low. SOL is now trading below $16.50 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/solana-sol-price-analysis-bulls-aim-recovery-to-18-50/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>.</p>
<p>On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $17.00 level. The next major resistance is near the $17.78 zone. Any more gains might send SOL price towards the $18.50 resistance zone, above which the price could accelerate higher. The next major resistance sits near the $20.00 level.</p>
<p>On the downside, initial support is near the $16.20 level. There is also a major bullish trend line forming with support near $16.20 on the 4-hour chart of the SOL/USD pair.</p>
<p>The next major support is near the $15.30 level. A downside break below the $15.30 support level might push the price toward the $14.20 support. Any more losses might open the doors for more losses toward the $13.20 low in the coming sessions.</p>
<div id="attachment_78981" style="width: 1835px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2023/06/SOL-1.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-78981" class="size-full wp-image-78981" src="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2023/06/SOL-1.png" alt="Solana (SOL) Price" width="1835" height="845" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-78981" class="wp-caption-text">Solana (SOL) Price</p></div>
<p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SOLUSD/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">chart</a>, Solana price is clearly trading just below $16.50 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours). Overall, the price must clear $17.00 and $17.78 to continue higher in the near term.</p>
<h2>Technical Indicators</h2>
<p>4 hours MACD – The MACD is now losing momentum in the bullish zone.</p>
<p>4 hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is now below the 50 level.</p>
<p>Key Support Levels – $16.20 and $15.30.</p>

<p><em>Bitcoin price is showing positive signs above $29,000 against the US Dollar. BTC might correct lower but dips could be limited below the $29,500 zone.</em></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price Analysis</h2>
<p>Bitcoin price started a decent increase above the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-bulls-aim-fresh-uptrend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">$27,000 resistance zone</a>. The price gained and cleared many hurdles near the $27,500 and $28,000 levels.</p>
<p>There was a clear move above the $28,500 level and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours). The price even rallied above the $30,000 resistance zone. However, the bears were active near the $31,450 zone. A high was formed near $31,443 and the price is now consolidating gains.</p>
<p>The price traded below $30,500 but is still above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $24,751 swing low to the $31,443 high. The price is now trading well above $28,500 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</p>
<p>Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $31,000 level. The first major resistance is near the $31,450 level, above which the price could rise toward the $32,200 zone.</p>
<p>Any more gains might send the price toward the $33,200 zone. If there is no upside break, the price might start a downside correction below $30,000.</p>
<p>The next key support is near the $29,850 level. There is also a major bullish trend line forming with support near $29,800 on the 4-hour chart of the BTC/USD pair.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Peter Wall – the former CEO of bitcoin mining firm Argo Blockchain – <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sustainable-bitcoin-protocol-welcomes-peter-135900027.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">has a new job</a>. He’s stepped aboard the train of Sustainable Bitcoin Protocol (SBP) and will serve as the company’s new senior advisor.</p>
<h2>Peter Wall and SBP&#8230; The Perfect Match?</h2>
<p>The goal is to ensure SBP has the appeal necessary to enter the hearts of institutional investors. It’s often been said in the digital currency arena that without institutions backing up crypto and blockchain, the industry is never going to reach the level of legitimacy so many traders and investors feel is necessary for it. Thus, it doesn’t matter how many retailers get involved. Without institutions, crypto won’t get far.</p>
<p>SBP CEO Brad van Voorhees expressed his enthusiasm about Wall coming onboard. In a recent interview, he stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are honored and excited to have Peter Wall join our team as a senior advisor. His expertise in the bitcoin mining sector, combined with his talent for storytelling, will be invaluable to our mission. We deeply respect Peter&#8217;s understanding of the pain points and challenges within the industry and believe that he will help us improve the way we articulate the mission of SBP and support miners.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wall was also very happy about being able to work with such a prominent company, explaining in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin has a unique opportunity to become one of the world&#8217;s most sustainable asset classes within the climate investing space, and I&#8217;m thrilled to join the SBP team in helping it reach that potential. Together, we will work to educate the global community on the environmental and social benefits of embracing bitcoin as a climate investing asset.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wall spent the first ten years of his career working as a journalist. From there, however, he became a prominent entrepreneur. Following this little stint, he joined the ranks of Argo Blockchain as the firm’s vice president of operations before eventually moving up the corporate ladder to serve as the enterprise’s CEO, a role he held for three years.</p>
<p>Wall is responsible for leading the company through a period of heavy growth. The company was listed on the Nasdaq (<a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-spikes-following-public-debut-of-coinbase/" data-wpel-link="internal">clearly the predecessor to Coinbase</a>) and raised more than $200 million while also ensuring its tactics and protocols were appropriate for the environment.</p>
<h2>Making Sure BTC is Right for the Environment</h2>
<p>Wall will use his expertise to not only garner more institutional support, but to also push the idea that bitcoin is the preferred asset of impact investors. He clearly believes in bitcoin and everything it stands for, and he wants the values of SBP and bitcoin to always align.</p>
<p>Sustainable Bitcoin Protocol is also very interested in pushing investments in the renewable energy sector, which it believes will give the bitcoin scene more life and strength in the eyes of the public.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not everyone loves bitcoin. In fact, there are those out there – like Warren Buffett or his <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/charlie-munger-is-still-one-of-btcs-biggest-haters/" data-wpel-link="internal">sidekick Charlie Munger</a> – that hate it with passion, and now, it looks like top economist Steve Hanke is joining the ranks of <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/bitcoin-is-a-bubble-with-no-inherent-value-and-is-terribly-overpriced-top-economist-steve-hanke-says/ar-AA1bdgaJ" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">BTC’s biggest opposers</a>.</p>
<h2>Steve Hanke Isn&#8217;t a BTC Fan</h2>
<p>In a recent interview, Hanke stated that bitcoin was a “bubble.” He said that it held no intrinsic value, that it was overpriced, and that it wasn’t likely to go anywhere in the future. In other words, those who buy it are stupid and are throwing their money into the trash can. Hanke commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin is a bubble. It has no inherent value and is terribly overpriced. Buying bitcoin is a fool’s game.</p></blockquote>
<p>While bitcoin indeed has a strong legion of fans, the world’s number one digital currency by market capitalization has had a hard time of things over the past year or so. In 2022, the asset lost more than 70 percent of its value and wound up taking a huge dip into the mid-$16K range by the end of the year. This was a big change from the new all-time high it achieved in November of 2021 (during that time, the currency hit a price of $68,000 per unit).</p>
<p>In any case, there was a lot of speculation of just how stable bitcoin truly was, as for the past several years, the asset had been touted as a hedge against inflation and all kinds of other things. These narratives were ultimately challenged in ways nobody thought possible given the currency fell so much during times of record inflation (it peaked last June and moved beyond nine percent).</p>
<p>With all this in mind, it seemed like bitcoin and many of its altcoin cousins were losing their mojos, but now that we’ve entered 2023, the currency and its brethren are experiencing rises here and there that have ultimately seen them enter phases of healing. Bitcoin recently hit a <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-rose-to-30k-in-mid-april-analysts-discuss-why/" data-wpel-link="internal">price of $30K</a>, and while the currency has dropped down again somewhat since then, the price was a walloping change from where it stood last year.</p>
<p>BTC has been subjected to some rather odd circumstances over the past few weeks given how much the financial space appears to be at war with itself. On the one hand, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/analysts-provide-their-thoughts-on-latest-bitcoin-rally/" data-wpel-link="internal">you have banks falling</a> left and right. Institutions like First Republic, Signature, and Silicon Valley Bank have crashed and burned, thus paving the way for bitcoin’s recovery.</p>
<h2>So Many Twists and Turns</h2>
<p>At the same time, organizations like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have done all they can to bring down major crypto players like <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/is-the-sec-trying-to-kill-crypto-for-good/" data-wpel-link="internal">Kraken</a> and <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-receives-wells-notice-from-the-sec/" data-wpel-link="internal">Coinbase</a>. This, naturally, has been weary for the asset.</p>
<p>Hanke is a former economic advisor to President Ronald Reagan, who served in the 1980s.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The idea that bitcoin was always a hedge against inflation has been rather prominent amongst crypto fans for the past few years. Now, according to Paul Tudor Jones – a bitcoin bull and billionaire hedge fund manager – it sounds like this idea <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/05/16/bitcoin-and-crypto-have-a-real-problem-paul-tudor-jones/?sh=2bd005494935" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">may have reached its peak</a> and is coming to an end.</p>
<h2>Paul Tudor Jones: BTC&#8217;s Inflationary Hedge Days Are Ending</h2>
<p>Many have long believed that buying bitcoin would somehow ensure their wealth and keep their portfolios steady should economic strife take hold. With assets like USD and other fiat currencies losing their value, the belief was that bitcoin could potentially work against inflation and other dollar-crushing maneuvers and keep one’s money pit nice and secure.</p>
<p>But Tudor Jones recently commented in an interview that he thinks the Fed is going to put a stop to the endless rate hikes we’ve seen the organization instill over the past year or so. With this on the horizon, one must assume that inflation will come to an end in the United States, and even if it doesn’t, it won’t be as harsh a problem as it has been over the past year. If this is the case, the days of buying bitcoin as an inflation hedge may be over. Jones commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>If inflation is truly done a bit, if that story’s been played, then you have to wonder… We were buying gold and bitcoin for the inflation hedges. That game may be over.</p></blockquote>
<p>Inflation has been striking the U.S. from all sides for well over a year. It hit a peak at more than nine percent in June last year. Thanks to weak leaders like Joe Biden, who has been in the habit of instilling poor economic policies and signing his name to a multitude of trillion-dollar spending bills, the country has been having to deal with rising food prices, gas prices, and just about everything else.</p>
<p>This has ultimately led the Fed to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/is-the-fed-bitcoins-worst-enemy-right-now/" data-wpel-link="internal">raise interest rates</a> as a means of fighting the ongoing inflation. However, this tactic hasn’t really done much except destroy crypto prices (remember 2022, anyone?) and prevent people from gaining access to the American dream. With rates being what they are, most people can no longer afford homes, cars, or other big items.</p>
<h2>I&#8217;m Still Holding Mine</h2>
<p>But while Jones is confident the initial goals of BTC holders will change, he’s still very much for keeping the asset as part of your portfolio. He stated that he’ll always allocate at least some small part of his wealth to BTC, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>From the beginning, I’ve always said I want to have a small allocation to it because it’s the only thing humans can’t adjust the supply in, so I’m sticking with it, and I’m going to always stick with it as a small diversification in my portfolio.</p></blockquote>

<p><em>Cardano price is holding the $0.265 support against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-bulls-aim-fresh-uptrend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a>. ADA price could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $0.305 resistance.</em></p>
<h2>Cardano Price Analysis</h2>
<p>This past week, Cardano price saw a decent upward move from the $0.240 support against the US Dollar. The ADA/USD pair was able to climb above the $0.265 and $0.280 resistance levels.</p>
<p>However, the bears were active near the $0.300 zone. A high is formed near $0.305 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a move below the $0.288 level. The price dipped below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.2300 swing low to the $0.3050 high.</p>
<p>ADA is now trading near $0.282 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/cardano-ada-price-analysis-recovery-possible-above-this-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support near $0.270 on the 4-hour chart.</p>
<p>On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $0.295 zone. The next major resistance is near the $0.305 level. A clear move above the $0.305 resistance might start a steady increase. In the stated case, the price may perhaps rise toward the $0.325 resistance or even $0.345.</p>
<p>On the downside, immediate support is near the $0.272 level. The next major support is near the $0.265 level. A clear move below the $0.265 level might send the price toward the $0.248 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.2300 swing low to the $0.3050 high. Any more losses might send the price toward the $0.240 support, below which the bears could aim for a test of $0.230.</p>

<p><em>Ethereum price is rising above the $1,850 level against the US Dollar. ETH/USD could rise further if it clears the $1,920 resistance zone.</em></p>
<h2>Ethereum Price Analysis</h2>
<p>In the past few days, Ethereum saw a <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-eth-could-recover-to-1900/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">decent increase</a> above the $1,800 level against the US Dollar. ETH price was able to gain pace for a move above the $1,850 level and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</p>
<p>The bulls even pushed the price above the $1,880 resistance zone. A high was formed near $1,936 before the bears appeared. There was a minor downside correction below the $1,900 level. The price dipped below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $1,620 swing low to the $1,936 high.</p>
<p>Ether’s price is now trading above $1,850 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-eth-consolidates-below-key-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>.

<p>Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $1,900 level. The next major resistance is near the $1,920 zone. A clear move above the $1,920 level could send the price toward $2,000. Any more gains could even send the price toward the $2,120 resistance zone or $2,200 in the near term.</p>
<p>On the downside, initial support is near the $1,840 level and the trend line. The next major support is now near the $1,800 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $1,620 swing low to the $1,936 high.</p>
<p>A break below the $1,800 support could push the price to $1,740. Any more losses could lead the price towards $1,650.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Paul Grewal – the chief legal executive of Coinbase, arguably the biggest and most popular crypto exchange in the U.S. – has <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/coinbases-chief-legal-officer-humbles-himself-before-pepe-coin-horde-after-newsletter-provides-incomplete-history-of-meme/ar-AA1b4eLQ" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">made a public apology</a> to the creators of a new meme token called $pepe for claiming the image associated with the token has largely been tied to alt-right hate groups.</p>
<h2>Coinbase Issues Public Apology</h2>
<p>$pepe features the image that has come to be known as Pepe the Frog, an odd and somewhat misshapen picture of an amphibious creature with big lips, big eyes, and a strange little smile on his face. No doubt you’ve seen this image at some point in your life, though over the past few years, the image has largely been associated with QAnon and other conservative organizations, which has led some to believe it’s somehow utilized by hate groups and similar platforms.</p>
<p>Coinbase is certainly one of the companies to believe that as just a few weeks ago, the top trading platform issued a newsletter claiming so. However, the firm is now taking a lot of flak for its lack of eloquence and for allegedly not including any reference to a story in which the image’s initial creator, a man named Matt Furie (who created the picture back in 2010), is working hard to take the image back and ensure it isn’t used by any other organizations that can be labeled political in any way.</p>
<p>Grewal has since issued an apology, saying the newsletter was premature and didn’t try hard enough to include all the appropriate information regarding both the image and the token it’s now associated with. Coinbase said in the statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>[The newsletter] did not provide the whole picture of the history of the meme, and we apologize to the community.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the currency has certainly found a strong audience – the $pepe meme token has seen its market cap explode in recent weeks – many platforms are refusing to list it, <a href="https://techreport.com/crypto-news/pepe-suffers-price-decline-as-coinbase-denies-listing-a-look-at-5-coins-that-could-be-the-next-pepe/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Coinbase included</a>. Also, not long ago, Gemini – a competing exchange in New York founded by the Winklevoss Twins of “The Social Network” fame – <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-is-finding-new-support-thanks-to-meme-tokens/" data-wpel-link="internal">issued a statement accompanying</a> the $pepe asset warning traders of the alleged risks that potentially come with using or investing in it.</p>
<h2>Be Aware!</h2>
<p>The warning read:</p>
<blockquote><p>$pepe is a new meme token. $pepe has no defined utility. Its value may be derived only from the continued willingness of market participants to demand and trade the token, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value should participants choose to no longer demand or trade $pepe. The token may also be subject to extreme price volatility if large, concentrated holdings of $pepe are liquidated in a short period of time.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other news, Coinbase has hired former <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-jones-05-12-2023/card/coinbase-gearing-up-for-battle-with-sec-hires-former-sen-toomey-other-ex-lawmakers-O0W5YDOz3BSzsqTiyG2G?mod=Searchresults_pos3&amp;page=1" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">senator Pat Toomey as an</a> advisor.</p>

<p>Positive signs are emerging for bitcoin on technical charts. The world’s number one digital currency by market cap is holding <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/bitcoin-holds-above-200-week-average-as-dollar-index-rallies-most-since-february-1032327294" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">a key support level</a> that could insinuate bullish trends will again emerge for the asset in the coming weeks and months.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Gains Traction</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a> fell by nearly six percent in mid-May. However, the asset – at the time of writing – has since risen by more than one percent and is trading in the low $27K range. Some believe this is because bitcoin has been largely tied to USD as of late, a sudden and interesting change for the world’s top digital currency. With the dip the dollar has taken in value, this could be why BTC has endured a small slip.</p>
<p>Alex Kuptsikevich – senior market analyst at FX Pro – said in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>By defending this key average, the bulls have convinced the market of the sustainability of the long-term bullish trend.</p></blockquote>
<p>He further stated that there are many cautious buyers in the mix as of late, and if they’re going to come back to the trading scene, bitcoin will need to reach a price of at least $28,500.</p>
<p>Others, by contrast, are a little more positive in their sentiment towards BTC and say that as the dollar continues to heal itself and rise through the price ranks, bitcoin will as well. Ilan Solot – co-head of digital assets at Marex – explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think the dollar is due for a bounce as markets take back some Fed easing implied in the futures curve. My fundamental FX framework: currencies are driven by real growth differentials and political considerations over longer cycles, but in the short term, it’s all about playing relative central bank policy (changes in nominal rates). Depending on how violent the dollar upswing gets, it could cause some short-term damage to assets like commodities and crypto.</p></blockquote>
<p>His words were seconded by analysts at Swiss Block Insights, who mentioned in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>The DXY could hit anywhere from 104 to 107 considering it crossed over the 102 level since mid-March… This month-long structure will eventually break, and both assets will experience price discovery. Bitcoin to the upside, and DXY to the downside.</p></blockquote>
<h2>More Wallets Holding onto Coins</h2>
<p>Solot further pointed out that there are many long-term wallets that have held coins for at least a six-month period prior to press time. Many of these wallets have accumulated new assets, suggesting they feel the digital currency space is going to endure more bullish trends in the coming future and likely experience greater price explosions.</p>
<p>2023, for the most part, has been quite different from 2022, which is arguably the worst year on record for BTC and crypto. The previous 12 months saw the world’s main crypto asset lose more than 70 percent of its value.</p>
