<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/wise-stock-jumps-deposits/">Wise Stock Jumps 18% on Customer Deposits and Higher Interest Rates</a></p>
<p>British fintech online money transfer firm <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/transferwise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wise</a>’s (LON: WISE) stock jumped almost 18% on Tuesday in reaction to a rise in company profits. In a recent statement, the London-based fintech noted that its profit before tax tripled to £146.5 million ($186.5 million). The company also reported that its earnings per share tripled to 11.53 pence.</p>
<p>According to data from MarketWatch, Wise stock has gained 6.58% in the last five days and 16.64% in a month. Since January, WISE rose 11.09%, and a whopping 97.6% in the past year. As of 1:49 pm BST, WISE was trading at £624.40 after climbing nearly 19% on the day. The company’s previous close was £525.40.</p>
<p>Wise has recorded a 34% increase in customer growth, with a total of 10 million as of March 31, 2023. Also, the company’s volume hit £104.5 billion after climbing 37%. For revenue, Wise hit £846.1 million, rising 51% from the £559.9 million the year before. Wise’s total income, buoyed by a spike in customer deposits, jumped 73% year-over-year (YoY), cresting at £964.2 million.</p>
<p>Generally, much of Wise’s profits came from rising interest rates initiated by the Bank of England (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/bank-of-england/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BoE</a>). Last week, the BoE <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/uk-raises-interest-13th-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased interest rates</a> for the 13th consecutive time, adding 50 basis points. The Monetary Policy Committee voted 7-2 in favor of the addition, increasing the BoE’s base rate to 5%.</p>
<p>The apex bank has been consistently increasing interest rates to fight rising inflation. In May, the annual consumer price index (CPI) rose 8.7%, higher than the 8.4% expected by economists.</p>
<h2>Wise Records Stock Spike Despite Headwinds</h2>
<p>The jump in Wise stock is a silver lining amid the company’s issues. Last year, the Abu Dhabi Global Market’s Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/fintech-firm-wise-fined-360000-by-abu-dhabi-regulator-2022-08-30/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fined</a> Wise $360,000 for violating anti-money laundering (AML) laws.</p>
<p>In a statement, the FSRA said Wise Nuqud, a local Wise subsidiary, did not create and operate an AML framework enough to comply with the agency’s requirements. Although the FSRA said it did not find any actual money laundering instances, it identified inadequacy and failures in setting up guideline systems and controls.</p>
<p>UK tax authorities added to Wise’s problems last year after accusing CEO and co-founder Kristo Kaarmann of tax evasion. Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs fined the CEO £365,651, nearly $495,000 at the time, for filing his personal tax returns late for the 2017/2018 tax year. A company spokesman confirmed that Kaarmann had paid the fine and added required late filing penalties.</p>
<p>In a recent conversation with BBC Radio, Kaarmann seemed to downplay the incident. According to him:</p>
<blockquote><p>“It has really not much to do with the business that we’re running. It was a personal mistake. I was really late with my taxes a long time ago and I paid the fines.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Nonetheless, Kaarmann said the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is investigating the incident. The outcome of the FCA’s investigation may affect his position as CEO if found guilty.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/boe-britons-digital-pound-cbdc/">BoE Reassures Britons Digital Pound Will Be Privacy-Centric CBDC</a></p>
<p>The Bank of England (BoE) has made extensive research on the best format for developing a digital pound to supplement the fiat system.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/boe-britons-digital-pound-cbdc/">BoE Reassures Britons Digital Pound Will Be Privacy-Centric CBDC</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/boe-britons-digital-pound-cbdc/">BoE Reassures Britons Digital Pound Will Be Privacy-Centric CBDC</a></p>
<p>The Bank of England (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/bank-of-england/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BoE</a>) is working on re-establishing the pound as the preferred global reserve currency through a Central Bank Digital Currency (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBDC</a>). The rise of the digital economy post-Covid-19 global pandemic through the cryptocurrency market has most governments thinking about moving to decentralized ledger technologies (DLTs). Moreover, the use of the digital economy is not only sustainable but also scalable to international markets. Consequently, the forex market will significantly benefit from fast verifiable digital currencies and so will the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<h2>BoE on Digital Pound Key Selling Features</h2>
<p>Over the last few years, the Bank of England has collaborated with different entities in the research of an excellent Central Bank Digital Currency. For instance, in February 2022, the Bank of England and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) agreed to collaborate on a twelve-month research project on CBDC. The Bank of England has also conducted several consultations with the public on how to develop and roll out the CBDC.</p>
<p>As a result, the BoE noted that the digital sterling or more popularly called the Britcoin will primarily focus on user privacy. According to  Tom Mutton, director of fintech at the Bank of England, the bank may look to other technologies beyond blockchain in developing its CBDC. However, Mutton noted that the Bank will give user data security huge attention in order to ensure the government does not become a tracking agent for the users.</p>
<p>“There will be no data shared with the Bank of England, we will know what transactions have happened but we will have no data on the individual who did it. While the wallet provider would have the user data but won’t have access to their transaction data,” Mutton noted.</p>
<p>Reportedly, the Bank of England is comparing the efficiency of using blockchain technology over traditional conventional ledgers in developing the CBDC that is compatible with the private sector.</p>
<p>“We want to be compatible with distributed-ledger business models in the private sector, but we were not convinced that distributed ledgers offered more efficiency over conventional ledgers,” he <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/digital-pound-will-be-pseudonymous-with-a-focus-on-privacy-boe-cbdc-chief" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">added</a>.</p>
<p>Currently, the Bank of England and the Treasury Department are waiting for feedback from the stakeholders which is open until June 30.</p>
<h2>Market Outlook</h2>
<p>The Bank of England is racing against time to avoid losing its aesthetic attraction to other global currencies like the Chinese Yuan that have already rolled out in the digital format. The launch of the digital pound comes amid a high-interest rate of about 5 percent despite the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) trying to bring down inflation to 2 percent.</p>
<p>With the UK operating freely from the shackles of the European Union, its future economic growth prospects are pegged to the relationship the country signs post-Brexit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/swiss-national-bank-wholesale-cbdc/">Swiss National Bank to Launch Wholesale CBDC (wCBDC) Pilot Soon</a></p>
<p>The Swiss National Bank (SNB) is set to create a digital currency known as a wholesale central bank digital currency (wCBDC). According to a Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/snb-launch-digital-currency-pilot-chairman-2023-06-26/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a>, the announcement was made by the head of SNB, Thomas Jordan, during a Point Zero conference in Zurich yesterday, 26 June.</p>
<h2>wCBDC by Swiss National Bank</h2>
<p>The wCBDC will be issued on the SIX digital exchange, the largest stock exchange in Switzerland, as part of a pilot program. Jordan said the project would begin soon and is scheduled to run for a limited time. The goal is to understand how the wCBDC performs in practical transactions with market participants.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not just an experiment. It will be real money equivalent to bank reserves, and the objective is to test real transactions with market participants,&#8221; said the SNB Chairman.</p>
<p>The move by the SNB reflects an increasing trend among central banks to explore and develop digital currencies. These virtual assets are gaining popularity due to their potential to streamline financial processes and improve cross-border payments. Switzerland, known for its financial innovation, aims to leverage this technology to enhance its financial economy.</p>
<p>The Swiss bank began the wCBDC campaign last year. In January, the bank announced the integration of the digital asset into five commercial banks, including Citi, Credit Suisse, and Goldman Sachs, as part of the second phase of its Project Helvetia.</p>
<p>SNB incorporated the wCBDC into the banks&#8217; existing back-office systems and processes.</p>
<p>Aside from Switzerland, other countries such as the United Kingdom, Russia, Japan, India, and even China are <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bank-of-england-boe-cbdc-test/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exploring</a> the use of central bank-issued virtual assets for cross-border payments.</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) also recently released a blueprint for CBDC creation in compliance with regulatory requirements. The IMF plans to<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/imf-global-cbdc-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> develop</a> a global platform where users can interact with CBDC.</p>
<h2>SNB Remains Cautious of Public CBDC</h2>
<p>Despite its plans to explore wCBDC, SNB has remained cautious when it comes to the implementation of public or retail <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">central bank digital currencies</a> (CBDCs), in contrast to its involvement with wholesale CBDCs.</p>
<p>The SNB Chairman has expressed concerns regarding the potential risks that retail CBDCs might introduce to the financial system, mainly due to the challenges associated with control and oversight.</p>
<p>Jordan acknowledged that the bank does not completely rule out the future introduction of retail CBDCs. However, he emphasized the current prudence exercised by the bank in approaching this area of digital currency.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not exclude that we will never introduce retail [CBDCs], but nevertheless, we are a little bit prudent at the moment,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The decision to prioritize wholesale CBDCs, which involve tokenized securities, showcases the SNB&#8217;s commitment to thoroughly assess and manage any associated risks before considering the introduction of retail CBDCs.  By focusing on this approach, the SNB aims to gain a comprehensive understanding of the potential benefits and challenges of digital currencies while safeguarding the stability of Switzerland&#8217;s financial system.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/whatsapp-business-200m-active-users/">WhatsApp Business Announces 200M Active Users and Launches Personalized Customer Messages </a></p>
<p>Meta Platforms-owned WhatsApp Business, a version of the instant messaging app built for small businesses, now has over 200 million users. According to Meta CEO <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/mark-zuckerberg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark Zuckerberg</a>, this is a 4x jump from three years ago. In 2020, 2 years after its launch, WhatsApp Business <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/whatsapp-business-now-with-50m-maus-adds-qr-code-and-catalog-sharing/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a> a monthly active user (MAU) count of 50 million.</p>
<p>Meta is now touting the advantages of business messaging as the company records a decrease in advertising. The social media and tech giant has lost some of its core advertising business to a dwindling economy and a general reduction in spending power.</p>
<p>In 2021, the Facebook company <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/facebook-name-meta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rebranded to Meta Platforms</a> to shift its focus to the metaverse. At the time, the company explained that it planned to make the metaverse a reality for users to find other people, grow their communities and advance businesses. However, Meta Platforms is <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/meta-zuckerberg-whatsapp-sales-metaverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shifting its focus</a> from the metaverse to apps. Speaking at a company-wide meeting shortly after announcing it would fire 11,000 workers, Zuckerberg said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“&#8230;The reality is that business messaging is probably going to be the next major pillar of our business as we work to monetize WhatsApp and Messenger more.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Expected WhatsApp Business Features for Users</h2>
<p>Meta Platforms is still working very hard to develop a metaverse and is investing several billion into the endeavor. To make up for the large investment, the company is focusing on generating revenue from other channels, including WhatsApp. Meta is now introducing more features to ramp up income from WhatsApp Business.</p>
<p>For instance, users on WhatsApp Business can now create “click-to-WhatsApp” ads right from the app instead of via a Facebook account. Zuckerberg mentioned last year during Meta’s earnings call for Q3 that these ads recorded an 80% year-on-year (YoY) growth, exceeding the $1.5 billion annual revenue run rate.</p>
<p>In addition to the in-app ad, WhatsApp Business plans to generate revenue from message automation. The paid feature would allow users to automate the delivery of personalized messages to customers. WhatsApp Business users will be able to create customer lists and automate different personalized messages for each list. Business owners may use this feature to offer a promo or discount code to one or more lists, and not their entire customer base.</p>
<h2>WhatsApp Payments</h2>
<p>WhatsApp is introducing in-app features that allow customers to pay businesses directly. In April, WhatsApp launched end-to-end payments in Brazil, with Zuckerberg <a href="https://web.facebook.com/zuck/posts/pfbid02j4zdLXXJ4yEcqXXkPLH394z4PgdbbBGCpsVp83vzY3aTPnR3dR4KxBXcpQoNH1Tnl?_rdc=1&amp;_rdr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirming</a> that anyone can “pay local businesses right in a WhatsApp chat”. In an official announcement, Meta described the feature as a “game-changer” that allows people to complete transactions without opening another app or visiting a website.</p>
<p>Previously, peer-to-peer payments were available to WhatsApp users in Brazil. However, regulatory requirements did not allow Meta to expand the feature for merchant purchases. Merchants had to use a third-party service to generate a payment link and then forward the same via WhatsApp. Now, in-app payments make the process of buying, selling, and paying, a lot more seamless.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/riot-platforms-33280-bitcoin-miners/">Riot Platforms to Onboard 33,280 Bitcoin Miners Ahead of 2024 Halving</a></p>
<p>Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: RIOT), a leading player in the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> (BTC) mining industry has announced a significant development in its quest to expand its mining capabilities.</p>
<p>The company stated in a <a href="https://www.riotplatforms.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/155/riot-purchases-7-6-ehs-of-next-generation-miners-from" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> that it has entered into a long-term purchase agreement with MicroBT Electronics Technology Co., LTD, a well-known manufacturer of Bitcoin miners. This strategic partnership aims to enhance Riot&#8217;s mining capacity by securing an initial order of 33,280 next-generation Bitcoin miners from MicroBT.</p>
<p>The total consideration for the initial order amounts to $162.9 million, excluding taxes, fees, and adjustments. This equates to an approximate cost of $21.50 per terahash (TH), a competitive price for the mining equipment.</p>
<p>This strategic move comes in anticipation of the 2024 <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitcoin-halving-2024-1-year-away/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">halving event</a>, which is expected to bring significant changes to the Bitcoin mining landscape. With this expansion, Riot Platforms aims to solidify its position as a major player in the crypto mining industry and maximize its mining capabilities for the future.</p>
<p>Riot stated that the miners ordered from MicroBT will be produced in the United States specifically for Riot&#8217;s Corsicana Facility. This move <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/riot-2022-report-growth-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aligns</a> with Riot&#8217;s strategy of expanding its mining operations within the country. With MicroBT manufacturing the newly acquired miners at a facility in Pittsburgh, PA, this collaboration establishes a robust domestic supply chain for Bitcoin miners, which is a significant milestone for the industry.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Riot noted that the deployment process is expected to take some time due to the significant number of miners involved. According to the agreement, the delivery of the new miners is set to commence in December 2023.</p>
<p>Riot Platforms anticipates completing the full deployment of the 33,280 miners by mid-2024. This time frame allows for careful installation, configuration, and optimization of the mining equipment to ensure optimal performance.</p>
<h2>Significance of Riot Platform&#8217;s Acquisition for the Halving Event</h2>
<p>Riot Platforms’ recent acquisition of Bitcoin miners from MicroBT holds significant importance in the context of the upcoming halving event in 2024. This is because the halving event, which occurs every four years, reduces block rewards for miners, affecting the economics of Bitcoin mining.</p>
<p>However, upon the completion of the deployment, Riot’s self-mining hash rate capacity is projected to increase to 20.1 EH/s (exahashes per second). Increasing the self-mining hash rate capacity is a strategic move by Riot Platforms.</p>
<p>As block rewards decrease, maintaining a competitive hash rate becomes crucial for mining profitability. By expanding its mining fleet and hash rate capacity, Riot Platforms aims to offset the effects of the halving, ensuring continued profitability and operational efficiency.</p>
<p>This significant boost in hash rate capacity positions the company as a major player in the Bitcoin mining industry, solidifying its role in validating transactions and contributing to the overall security and efficiency of the Bitcoin network.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/baidu-ernie-3-5-chatgpt-gpt-4/">Baidu Says Ernie 3.5 Outdid ChatGPT and GPT-4 in Key Metrics</a></p>
<p>Competition in the AI market heats up as China&#8217;s Baidu <a href="http://research.baidu.com/Blog/index-view?id=185" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> its AI model Ernie 3.5 beats the popular OpenAI&#8217;s ChatGPT AND GPT-4 on key tests. The Chinese internet company <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/baidu-chatgpt-ernie-bot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> the Ernie bot at an event in March. At the time of the announcement, CEO Robin Li said that the new product was imperfect and would continue to improve as people use it and give feedback. Within an hour after revealing the Ernie bot, Baidu stated that about 30,000 corporate clients joined the waitlist to access the chatbot.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Baidu has been publicly testing Ernie Bot since it was unveiled in March. The chatbot, built on the Chinese search engine&#8217;s foundational AI model called Ernie, is trained on extensive data. On the other hand, ChatGPT, which Baidu said Ernie 3.5 outperformed, is based on OpenAI&#8217;s GPT 3.5 model. It also added its AI model beats OpenAI&#8217;s latest and more advanced model, GPT-4. It noted that Ernie 3.5 performed better than OpenAI&#8217;s product in Chinese language tests.</p>
<h2>Baidu Claims Ernie 3.5 Is Better than ChatGPT in Multiple Key Area</h2>
<p>The Chinese company made the claim while citing a <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/QVdkmofRSTgjQ7UOFX7s1g" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a> by China Science Daily. According to the report, a &#8220;Few-Shot evaluation&#8221; reveals that Ernie 3.5 outperformed ChatGPT in multiple test sets. The three evaluation benchmarks are AGIEval, C-Eval, and MMLU. Microsoft Research the AGIEval evaluation benchmark to examine the model&#8217;s performance level in the &#8220;human-oriented&#8221; standardized test. The focus is on 20 official, public, and distinct qualifying exams, such as SAT exam in the US and college entrance examinations in China. More include Bar exams, American GMAT, GME, and so on. In addition, Berkeley University, Columbia University, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and the University of Chicago jointly release MMLU. The large-scale multi-task language understanding test measures the models&#8217; English interdisciplinary professional ability. This test covers different educational areas like social sciences, humanities, science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), and more.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the c-Eval evaluation is a Chinese basic model evaluation containing 13,948 multiple-choice questions covering 53 subjects. The evaluation benchmark was created and released by the joint effort of Tsinghua University, the University of Edinburgh, and Shanghai Jiaotong University.</p>
<p>The result of the AGIEval and C-Eval tests shows that Ernie 3.5 achieved higher scores than other large models, including ChatGPT, and surpassed GPT-4. Also, the Baidu AI model also outdid ChatGPT&#8217;s 40.27 points and GPT -4&#8217;s 56.96 points. Ernie 3.5 scored a whopping 64.37 points, making the first position. For the Chinese c-Eval evaluation, Ernie 3.5 outstripped ChatGPT. While the Chinese AI model scored the highest at 71.93 points, ChatGPT measured 51.70 points, and GPT-4 got 68.57 points. In addition, Baidu mentioned more results that showed that Ernie 3.5 has &#8220;outstanding Chinese ability&#8221; and outperformed ChatGPT and GPT-4.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/fireblocks-cloud-crypto-custody/">Fireblocks Expands Cloud Support for Crypto Custody</a></p>

<p>Blockchain security service provider, Fireblocks, has expanded its cloud service for crypto custody and settlement. According to the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fireblocks-expands-support-for-banking--financial-institutions-with-new-hsm-public--private-cloud-capabilities-301863908.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announcement</a>, the service will now include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform, Alibaba Cloud, Thales, and Securosys.</p>
<h2>Cloud Computing Meets Crypto Security</h2>
<p>Fireblocks&#8217; platform uses a combination of security technologies to protect private keys and transactions from cyberattacks, internal fraud and human error. Last year, the company became the first to <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/fireblocks-first-ccss-certificate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">receive</a> the Cryptocurrency Security Standard (CCSS) certification since its inception in 2014. The certificate provided objective proof of the company’s adherence to the highest security standards in the crypto industry.</p>
<p>By expanding its cloud support, Fireblocks’ customers can now enjoy the advantages of cloud computing, such as scalability, flexibility, and saving costs. They can do this without compromising on security and compliance for their digital assets.</p>
<p>According to Fireblocks&#8217; CEO and co-founder Michael Shaulov, cloud support will allow Fireblocks to serve a wider range of customers from different sectors. &#8220;By expanding our cloud support, we are enabling our customers to choose the best option for their business needs, whether it&#8217;s SaaS, private cloud or on-premises,&#8221; Shaulov said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are also opening up new opportunities for innovation and collaboration in the crypto ecosystem,&#8221; he concluded.</p>
<h2>Crypto Custody and Settlement Market Heats Up</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, Fireblocks’ cloud support comes at a time when more and more institutional investors and corporations are joining the crypto space. This creates a huge demand for crypto custody and settlement solutions that are secure and scalable. A <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-global-crypto-adoption-index/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Chainalysis report</a> shows that institutional transactions made up 61% of the crypto market in the first half of 2023, up from 39% in 2020</p>
<p>With more institutional investors and corporations entering the crypto space, there has been a rise in demand for enterprise-grade solutions that can handle large volumes.</p>
<p>Fireblocks already serves some of the biggest names in the crypto and financial industries, such as Binance, Coinbase, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ftx-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a>, Galaxy Digital, Gemini, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/kraken/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kraken</a>, Revolut, ANZ Bank, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/bny-mellon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BNY Mellon</a>, BNP Paribas, and Robinhood. Its platform supports a wide range of tokens, protocols, and exchanges &#8211; about 500, 50, and 300 respectively. With its expanded cloud support, Fireblocks aims to do even more for the crypto community.</p>

<p>Mizuho Bank said that it will use the AI tool in the bank's brokerage unit. The Japanese banking giant will conduct an "ideathon" next month and brainstorm various ways to experiment with the technology. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/mizuho-45000-employees-test-openai/">Japanese Financial Giant Mizuho to Let 45000 Employees Test Out OpenAI</a></p>
<p>On Tuesday, June 27, Japan&#8217;s third-largest banking institution <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/mizuho/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mizuho</a> declared that it will allow all of its 45,000 employees in Japan to use Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI from this week.</p>
<p>This will make the Mizuho Group the first financial company in Japan to use generative AI. Niu Dujungang, head of the company’s digitalization, said that access to Azure OpenAI services will be first available to the loan business department.</p>
<p>He also added that several employees already have hands-on experience using OpenAI&#8217;s <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/everything-you-need-to-know-about-chatgpt-ai-chatbot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChatGPT</a> application in their daily lives. Additionally, employees at Mizuho Bank have been quite optimistic about the application and believe that it would bring disruptive innovation.</p>
<p>One of the proposed uses of the AI tool will be to serve as a “one-stop reference point for the bank’s vast trove of internal rules, processes, and other manuals”.</p>
<p>The current stand undertaken by Mizuho Bank is quite a contrast to what banks in North America have been doing. Several banks in America have been seeking to impose restrictions on the use of AI tools. Mizuho Bank stated that they are aware of the risks of using AI, however, they believe that the guidelines will help mitigate these potential issues.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-24/citigroup-goldman-sachs-join-chatgpt-crackdown-fn-reports" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, Wall Street banks, including Bank of America, Citigroup, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/goldman-sachs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Goldman Sachs</a>, and Wells Fargo, are imposing restrictions on the use of ChatGPT. This move is aimed at proactively safeguarding against any potential unintended effects. However, Mizuho, a bank in Japan, is embracing OpenAI&#8217;s tool, although Japan&#8217;s privacy watchdog has issued a warning regarding its use.</p>
<h2>Mizuho Bank to Make Employees Aware of AI</h2>
<p>Niu Dujungang stated that the bank will hold an idea marathon in the next month of July in order to encourage employees to try the new technology. Currently, Mizuho Bank is using generative AI in order to provide references and suggestions for employees to review complex internal rules, procedures and more.</p>
<p>Toshitake Ushiwatari, general manager of Mizuho Bank&#8217;s digital planning department, <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2023/06/27/business/corporate-business/mizuho-ai-access/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s like poking a beehive. They think it will completely re-set the world, triggering disruptive innovation.”</p></blockquote>
<p>He acknowledged the potential risks associated with generative AI and mentioned that the bank will provide guidelines to employees regarding information management, intellectual property, and ethics when implementing this technology. However, Ushiwatari emphasized that despite the risks, generative AI has the power to benefit society, and the bank cannot ignore its potential. He stated, &#8220;This is a necessary step for us; otherwise, we will fall behind.&#8221;<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/robinhood-cut-staff-layoffs/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/robinhood-cut-staff-layoffs/">Robinhood to Cut 7% of Its Staff after Two Rounds of Layoffs</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/robinhood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robinhood</a> plans to lay off some part of its staff as it seeks to reduce the cost of operations due to the reduction in demand it is experiencing. Many current workers were employed to fill various needed roles during the Covid era. During that time, there was a huge demand for cryptocurrency trading and other Robinhood services, which led to a significant increase in the company&#8217;s monthly users.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, many people were able to devote their time to trading, and they also had more money since they were not going out and spending as much as they normally would. Additionally, many benefited from the government&#8217;s stimulus checks. The increase in users necessitated an increase in the company&#8217;s workforce.  As a result, between 2020 and 2021, the number of employees at the company increased from 700 to around 3,800.</p>
<p>Despite having a large customer base during the pandemic, the California-based company has struggled to retain many, resulting in a significant decline in monthly active users.</p>
<p>According to Cointelegraph, a company spokesperson neither confirmed nor denied the news in a comment to the media agency. The spokesperson <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/robinhood-layoff-seven-percent-staff-report" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We&#8217;re ensuring operational excellence in how we work together on an ongoing basis. In some cases, this may mean teams make changes based on volume, workload, org design, and more.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Robinhood Had Two Rounds of Layoffs in 2022</h2>
<p>This is not the first time Robinhood is laying off staff. If executed, this will be the brokerage firm&#8217;s third layoff within one year. In April 2022, it laid off 9% of its workers. The CEO, Vlad Tenev, stated that the layoff was necessary for efficiency and to increase the company&#8217;s velocity. He mentioned that there were many roles with overlapping duties, as well as other issues the company needed to address.</p>
<p>In August of the same year, the stock trading company laid off 23% of its staff, primarily those involved in marketing and program management. Tenev, when discussing the second layoff in 2022, mentioned that the first round of layoffs did not go far enough and that the company needed to reduce costs amid inflation.</p>
<p>It is evident that most of the recent layoffs at Robinhood have been a consequence of the hiring spree that took place between 2020 and 2021. The surge in demand for crypto, shares, and other Robinhood services subsided as people had to return to their workplaces, resulting in a drastic reduction in the number of service users. The last two rounds of layoffs affected more than 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>This news comes at a time when the company has just <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/robinhood-acquire-x1-95m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> X1 Inc, a financial technology firm, for approximately $95 million. This move aims to diversify the company&#8217;s income streams as it seeks to make up for the issues in its primary business.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/saudi-aramco-oil-demand-china/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

<p>Saudi-owned oil and gas firm <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/saudi-aramco/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saudi Aramco</a> has a strong outlook on oil for the rest of the year as it anticipates healthy demand from India and China. Saudi Aramco predicts strong demand from both countries regardless of an economic retraction expected in global markets.</p>
<p>Speaking at the Energy Asia conference in Kuala Lumpur, Aramco CEO Amin Nasser said oil market fundamentals “remain generally sound” for 2023. He maintained this expectation, notwithstanding several signs of economic decline in China and India.</p>
<p>“Despite the recession risks in several OECD countries, the economies of developing countries, especially China and India, are driving oil demand growth of more than 2 million barrels per day this year,” said he.</p>
<p>In May, China’s exports <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/07/chinas-exports-plunge-by-7point5percent-in-may-far-more-than-expected.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">fell</a> to $283.5 billion, according to customs data, representing a heavy 7.5% year-on-year (YoY) decrease. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a mild 0.4% drop. In addition, customs data also showed that China’s exports to the European Union (EU) in the same period fell by 4.9%. Furthermore, the dollar value of exports from January to May plunged by 15.1%.</p>
<p>Last week, investment banking and management giant <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/goldman-sachs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Goldman Sachs</a> reduced its growth outlook for China’s 2023 gross domestic product (GDP) from 6% to 5.4%. Goldman also reduced the outlook for 2024 from 4.6% to 4.5%. In addition to Goldman, several other financial services giants had cut their outlook on China’s growth. Reduced outlooks came from Bank of America, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/jpmorgan-chase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JPMorgan</a>, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/standard-chartered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Standard Chartered</a>, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ubs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UBS</a>, and Nomura.</p>
<h2>Aramco to Expect Rise in India’s Oil Demand Along With China’s</h2>
<p>Saudi Aramco’s expectation of solid oil demand corroborates a forecast published by the International Energy Agency (IEA). In a recently-released medium-term market report, the IEA predicts that global oil demand will hit 2.4 million barrels per day this year. The agency also said China is responsible for 60% of the increase.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the IEA’s report also indicates that demand from India is “equally robust”. According to the agency, May figures in India show the country’s demand for diesel and gasoline broke records.</p>
<h2>Oil Consumption to Peak Before 2030</h2>
<p>Although Aramco and IEA predictions for oil demand are bullish for the year, the outlook differs for the decade. According to the IEA, global oil demand will nearly halt by 2028. The agency believes the world’s current shift to clean energy, including the continued adoption of electric vehicles, will affect oil demand.</p>
<p>The IEA added that China’s ability to maintain its pre-COVID momentum would affect the global outlook. Based on the IEA’s prediction, China’s consumption will peak this year after rebounding to 1.5 million barrels per day. However, consumption could fall to 290,000 per day YoY from next year until 2028.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the IEA’s outlook for supply is healthy. The agency estimates that global supply capacity will hit 111 million barrels per day by 2028, rising by 5.9 million barrels per day. The increase will create an extra 4.1 million barrels per day, especially in the UAE and Saudi Arabia.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-house-chatgpt-privacy/" rel="prev">next</a></p>
