										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>According to a Dec. 23 report by <a href="https://tass.com/economy/1555219">local news outlet Tass</a>, Russia&#8217;s cryptocurrency mining bill, which would legalize crypto mining and the sale of mined crypto, could be adopted by January.<br /><br />On November 17, 2022, the <a href="https://static.consultant.ru/obj/file/doc/pr_fz_181122_585.pdf">bill</a> was introduced in the State Duma, Russia&#8217;s lower house of parliament. At the time, Anatoly Aksakov, Chairman of the State Duma&#8217;s Financial Market Committee, <a href="https://www.pnp.ru/economics/aksakov-anonsiroval-vnesenie-v-gosdumu-zakonoproekta-o-mayninge-v-blizhayshee-vremya.html">predicted</a> that the law would pass all three parliamentary readings in December.<br /><br />As per Aksakov, the bill&#8217;s passage was postponed because of concerns that it may open the door for a capital flight out of Russia.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“…according to the critics of the bill, it could create channels for capital flight from our country. Ostensibly, it will be the activity of buying cryptocurrency, but in fact, the main objective will be capital flight from our country.“</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aksakov acknowledged that the risks of capital flight are real, and he will work with the opponents to change the legislation.<br /><br />If the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-mining-operations-stopped-by-sbi-holdings-in-russia/">crypto mining bill</a> in Russia is approved, Russians would be able to mine cryptocurrencies lawfully. The measure would also enable Russian miners to sell the cryptocurrency they have mined on international marketplaces.<br /><br />The proposal would also permit Russian miners to trade cryptocurrency they have produced within the nation under an <em>&#8220;experimental legal regime,&#8221;</em> according to a Nov. 18 article from<a href="https://interfax.com/newsroom/top-stories/85091/"> Interfax</a>. Cryptocurrency payments were made illegal in the country in July.<br /><br />It should be mentioned that the Russian Federation&#8217;s Central Bank stated earlier this month that it theoretically supports the law. <a href="https://www.interfax.ru/russia/875737">Interfax reported</a> on December 7 that the monetary authority is opposed to enabling Russians to sell cryptocurrency they have produced domestically. The central bank believes that miners should only be allowed to sell their crypto to non-residents and on international markets.<br /><br />With the postponement, Aksakov is optimistic that the mining measure may be updated to adequately address critics&#8217; concerns and will be ready for passage in January 2023. However, he warned that if an agreement with the critics is not reached by next month, the bill&#8217;s passage could be delayed much further.<br /><br />Russia developed a <a href="https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/5572328">draft framework</a> in September to allow the use of cryptocurrencies in cross-border transactions. According to <a href="https://tass.com/economy/1552829">TASS</a>, the Russian central bank wants to test the use of cryptocurrency to settle foreign transactions within the regulatory sandbox environment on December 19.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/here-is-what-historical-data-presents-for-bitcoin-in-december-ftx-japan-to-allow-withdrawal-of-funds/">Bitcoin</a>&#8216;s circulating supply off exchanges is currently at 18.19 million coins, the highest quantity ever seen. The present data reflects an increasing trend of BTC withdrawals from centralized exchanges, which increased dramatically following the FTX crash last month. In comparison, just 1.16 million BTC tokens are now available on exchanges.<br /><br />Santiment, a cryptocurrency analytics firm, has brought the development to the public&#8217;s attention. According to Santiment statistics, BTC supply on exchanges has consistently reached all-time highs in recent months, with the current supply of 18.19 million tokens being the most recent ATH.<br /><br />Contrarily, BTC supply has been steadily falling on exchanges, and the most recent value of 1.16 million is the lowest since November 2018. This underlines a significant outflow of BTC from exchanges, which accelerated after the FTX meltdown as investors&#8217; faith in centralized exchanges decreased. Self-custody is getting more popular among investors.<br /><br /><a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1605755263083896832">Santiment</a> disclosed on Thursday through a tweet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Illustrated is the 10-year long-term view of Bitcoin’s funds moving on and off exchanges. The amount of coins in self custody continues creating a new AllTimeHigh, now at 18.2M $BTC. Meanwhile, coins on exchanges is at just 1.2M $BTC, a 4-year low&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Bitcoin On-Chain Indicators Remain Positive</h2>
<p>The mass removal of BTC from exchanges is also a bullish sign, as investors frequently deposit assets and maintain them on exchanges when they intend to sell them. Taking one&#8217;s assets off exchanges, on the other hand, frequently shows a desire to keep them for an extended time.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the CryptoQuant <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/asset/btc/chart/exchange-flows/exchange-reserve?exchange=all_exchange&amp;window=DAY&amp;sma=0&amp;ema=0&amp;priceScale=log&amp;metricScale=linear&amp;chartStyle=line">BTC Exchange Reserve</a> indicator is encouraging, as a decline in exchange reserves signals a reduction in selling pressure. The metric supports the Santiment data even more.<br /><br />Additionally, despite the current drop, the majority of BTC on-chain indicators show optimistic trends. The <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/asset/btc/chart/network-indicator/binary-cdd?window=DAY&amp;sma=0&amp;ema=0&amp;priceScale=log&amp;metricScale=linear&amp;chartStyle=column">Binary CDD</a> shows little movement among long-term holders. In addition, investors are selling at a loss, which could point to a market bottom in a bear market, according to the <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/asset/btc/chart/market-indicator/adjusted-sopr-asopr?window=DAY&amp;sma=0&amp;ema=0&amp;priceScale=log&amp;metricScale=log&amp;chartStyle=line">Adjusted SOPR</a> (aSOPR) metric.<br /><br />The CEO of the trading business Factor LLC, Peter Brandt, a seasoned trader, recently sent a cryptic message that may have foretold a BTC collapse below $10K before a rally to $120K. As of the time of publication, BTC is trading at $16,836, up 1% over the previous day.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/binance-labs-launches-8-new-blockchain-projects-via-its-incubator-program/">Binance Labs</a>, the investing arm of crypto exchange Binance, purportedly achieved a historical return on investment of up to 2,100%.<br /><br />According to the most recent <a href="https://www.binance.com/zh-CN/blog/community/%E7%9B%B4%E9%9D%A2fud%EF%BD%9C%E5%AF%B9%E4%BA%8E%E8%BF%91%E6%9C%9F%E5%AA%92%E4%BD%93%E5%8F%8A%E7%A4%BE%E5%8C%BA%E8%B4%A8%E7%96%91%E7%9A%84%E5%9B%9E%E5%BA%94-6174048639837904159">blog post</a>, the total assets under administration have now reached $7.5 billion. The site also informed consumers that its <em>“financial status is very healthy”</em> and that it has enough capital reserves to cover day-to-day operations and weather any difficult cycles.<br /><br />Binance claims that all assets held by users on its platform are supported 1:1. Furthermore, clients can withdraw money at any time, dispelling rumors about insufficient reserves for users to do so.<br /><br />Also, it declared that it will not pilfer such assets for any transactions or investments, a dig at FTX, whose founders are accused of misappropriating user cash. The exchange further stated that it has no obligations and is not on the creditors&#8217; list of any recently bankrupt company.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A few negative cases do not represent the entire industry. Many people started to doubt and attack the encryption industry as a whole through a few negative cases, which shows that the development of the entire industry still has a long way to go.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Following the demise of <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ftx-token-trading-volume-jumps-1060-as-price-rises-on-ftx-revival-proposal-supported-by-sam-bankman-fried/">FTX</a>, the crypto industry&#8217;s latest obsession has been completing proof-of-reserve attestations. As a result, Binance launched a Merkle tree-based Bitcoin and Ethereum system. Other platforms, including OKX, Crypto.com, and ByBit, have followed a similar approach in response to increased investor demand for transparency from centralized exchanges around the world.<br /><br />As of November 22nd, global audit company Mazars certified that Binance had enough bitcoins and wrapped bitcoins (WBTC) to cover all user balances on the site. Several industry experts, however, pointed out that the report focused more on telling the public about the backed assets than the indicated reserves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Jair Bolsonaro, <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/brazils-historic-crypto-bill-to-appear-before-senate/">Brazil</a>&#8216;s leaving president, has signed legislation that would make the use of cryptocurrency as a payment method legal in the country. <br /><br />The president who is slated to leave office on December 31, adopted a crypto regulatory measure just passed by the country&#8217;s Chamber of Deputies and Senate on Thursday. The new law creates a crime of fraud involving virtual assets, which carries a penalty of four to six years in prison as well as a fine. The bill also established a license for <em>&#8220;virtual service providers,&#8221;</em> which will be required of digital asset enterprises such as exchanges and trading intermediaries. Bloomberg was the first to report the news.<br /><br />According to the bill&#8217;s content, Brazilians will not be able to utilize cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin as legal tender, as they may in El Salvador. However, the recently passed bill includes numerous digital currencies in the list of acceptable payment methods in the country. The administration of Bolsonaro also does not specify which deferral agency will be in charge of overseeing Bitcoin payments. <br /><br /><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/digital-assets-trader-alex-saunders-says-some-top-assets-are-ghost-chains-recommends-top-10-altcoins/">Digital assets</a> are considered securities in Brazil, as they are in the United States, and thus fall under the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The measure also includes regulations devised in response to the collapse of FTX, such as requiring crypto exchanges to explicitly differentiate between user and business assets.<br /><br />Companies have 180 days to adjust to the new regulations proposed in the bill after it is approved on Thursday. Bolsonaro will be succeeded as president on January 1, 2023, by Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who will take over from him. Bolsonaro won&#8217;t be in office to witness the implementation of the new crypto law.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/stellar-xlm-holds-on-to-120-gains-bitcoin-and-altcoins-recovery-kicks-off-but-its-time-to-pay-attention/">Stellar (XLM)</a> has rebounded marginally in the last 24 hours. At the time of publication, XLM was trading at $0.075, up 1.60% in the previous 24 hours. Uphold, a digital money platform with millions of users has announced the integration of Stellar (XLM) to allow users to deposit and withdraw to their private external wallets on the XLM network. The year has seen the launch of Soroban, Stellar’s new smart contract platform, which is currently in preview release.

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/xlm-price-analysis-stellar-climbs-22-as-its-smart-contract-platform-launches-robinhood-adds-xlm-to-crypto-offerings/">XLM/USD</a> extended its drop to a new 2022 low of $0.0725 during the week, closing not much higher than the level. The week started slowly, as usual, with the market still fixated on issues affecting the crypto market. The crypto pair is in a weak negative trend below its main moving averages of 50 and 200, with the spot falling to levels not seen since December 2020.<br /><br />The breakdown of the low level of 0.0725 may extend the slump from the $0.1295 November high. A rebound higher could pave the way for a retest of the $0.0990 level. As long as the support level of $0.0725 is maintained, this is a privileged circumstance for XLM/USD bulls to recover recent losses. However, XLM/USD might encounter a rugged resistance area in the $0.1150 region.</p>

<p>The XLM/USD has been fighting to recover from the lower end of the four-hour chart and is currently trading at $0.0755. The Relative Strength Index is trending at its midline, indicating that the market is seeking full recovery and that a further rebound is possible. A further decline might be elusive at this time.<br /><br />The pair&#8217;s next level of resistance is at $0.0800, which might limit its price movement, with further movement beyond this level, the pair might move towards the $0.0990 level predicted. The $0.0725 low provides some support, followed by $0.0700 levels, the next swing low if a move lower occurs. The cushion is bigger at the 1.1602 level.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the United States said on Thursday that it is looking into audit firms that work for cryptocurrency companies.<br /><br />According to the<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-heightening-scrutiny-of-auditors-crypto-work-11671681693"> Wall Street Journal (WSJ)</a>, the SEC will boost its scrutiny of audit firms that produce audit reports for crypto companies. The regulatory authority noted that it must take this measure due to worries that investors are receiving false reassurance from audit reports and risking exposure to cryptocurrencies. As the fallout from FTX&#8217;s bankruptcy spreads, more crypto businesses have been forced to produce reports on the health of their reserves.<br /><br />Several <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/crypto-exchanges-prepares-ahead-of-expected-bitcoin-cash-fork-on-the-15th-of-november/">crypto exchanges</a> advocated releasing proof-of-reserves to reassure clients that their assets were safe and to demonstrate that the company is financially healthy and steady.<br /><br />Acting SEC Chief Accountant Paul Munter told the WSJ:<br /><br /><em>We’re warning investors to be very wary of some of the claims that are being made by crypto companies.</em><br /><br />The SEC maintains its anti-crypto stance and has steadily intensified its monitoring of enterprises dealing in digital assets as the market grows. As bitcoin firms are now required to disclose the health of their finances, the SEC has decided to scrutinize how cryptocurrency firms present audit firm reports. Banks and auditing firms have been hesitant to cooperate with cryptocurrency firms because regulatory pressure surrounding cryptocurrencies remains ambiguous.<br /><br /><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bybit-introduces-merkle-tree-verified-proof-of-reserves/">Mazars</a>, a French corporation, just temporarily suspended its auditing services to Binance, Crypto.com, and KuCoin. Mazars even removed the link to Binance&#8217;s proof-of-reserve assessment from its website after discovering that the exchange&#8217;s Bitcoin reserves were overcollateralized.<br /><br />Bloomberg was the first to disclose that Mazars had terminated its services to the aforementioned crypto businesses, and that other auditing firms, including FTX&#8217;s auditor Armanino, had also stopped working with crypto exchanges like OKX and Gate.io.<br /><br />As a result, the SEC is issuing warnings to audit firms working on crypto audits, believing that crypto exchanges are utilizing audit firms&#8217; proof-of-reserve reports to their advantage. The SEC sees a risk in this because it contains insufficient financial information to determine whether a corporation has enough assets to cover its liabilities.<br /><br />The SEC&#8217;s chair, Gary Gensler, cautioned that investors are still exposed to the dangers associated with the crypto market unless these firms comply with time-tested securities regulations. Gensler was responding to the SEC&#8217;s fraud accusations against former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison and FTX co-founder Gary Wang. Gensler also stated that the government will continue to employ all available measures to bring the bitcoin business into compliance.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/elon-musk-pays-visit-to-twitters-headquarters-ahead-of-takeover/">Twitter</a> announced a new feature called &#8220;Cashtags&#8221; on Thursday, which includes price charts for major cryptocurrencies and stock assets. Elon Musk, the new owner of Twitter and a tech millionaire, offered a feature built exclusively for the financial industry, with a particular advantage for traders, financial specialists, investors, and organizations. <br /><br />$Cashtags allows users to view graphs, charts, and other data from stocks, cryptocurrencies, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) within a tweet.<br /><br />According to the official Twitter Business account:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you Tweet the symbol of a major stock, ETF, or cryptocurrency with a $ in front of it (like $BTC), people on Twitter see a clickable link that takes them to search results. Starting today, these search results will include the pricing graphs for major symbols.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It went on to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can also search for symbols directly, without clicking on a link within a Tweet. Most symbols with and without the $ sign will work in search (QQQ or $QQQ).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Users can enable the new option by clicking on<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-and-altcoins-tumble-more-declines-to-expect-what-analysts-and-on-chain-data-say-on-the-health-of-the-crypto-markets/"> $BTC and $ETH</a>, or by searching for any crypto asset. Users can access the wallet provider by clicking on the &#8216;View on Robinhood&#8217; link. The addition of a link to Robinhood may indicate a potential relationship between the two companies, although no official announcement has been made.<br /><br />Elon Musk congratulated the Twitter team and stated that this is<em> &#8220;only one of many product improvements coming to financial Twitter!&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Musk has previously stated that his crypto holdings consist of only Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin (DOGE), and Doge holders have been eagerly expecting the announcement of a payments connection since his takeover of Twitter. However, the digital tycoon announced his resignation as Twitter&#8217;s CEO, and Dogecoin has inevitably responded unfavorably in the market after outperforming the market in November, not long after Tesla CEO Elon Musk acquired Twitter for $44 billion in October.<br /><br />In September, a complaint was also filed alleging Musk of running a pyramid scheme to fund DOGE.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ada-price-analysis-key-levels-to-watch-amid-present-volatility-cardanos-sundaeswap-announces-new-milestone/">Cardano’s ADA</a> is currently down 3% in the last 24 hours at $0.25 as the crypto market seeks a positive catalyst for its recovery. The Cardano Foundation has taken to Twitter to share the highlights of the about-to-be-concluded year 2022. According to the graphic posted, the number of transactions reached 56.9 million, up 139% from 2021. At the same time, the overall number of wallets grew by 47% to 3.80 million, while the number of delegated wallets increased by 27% to 1.24 million. According to GitHub data, Cardano ranks among the top three chains in terms of daily development activity. According to the latest statistics provided by IOG, 1,151 projects are in various stages of development on the Cardano blockchain. So far, 111 projects have been launched. The number of Plutus scripts is 4445, which marks a 394% increase since the year 2021, while native tokens are now over 7.3 million, marking a 192% increase since 2021. Minting policies are up 69% year on year to 66,950.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $0.650, $0.500, $0.300<br />Support Levels: $0.250, $0.150, $0.100</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ada-price-analysis-cardano-price-dips-network-adds-70000-new-holders-within-a-month/">ADA/USD</a> is trading in a weak downtrend beneath the technical daily moving averages of 50 and 200 as the pair remains under pressure near its yearly low. The price is trading a little below the 2021 lows.<br /><br />Prolonged recovery from $0.250 (low) towards the $0.300 level could pave the way for a retest of further lows around the $0.200 level. At the moment, the ADA trend is bearish, with the resistance level of $0.300 holding in the event of a strong rebound.</p>
<h4>ADA/USD 4-Hour Chart: Bearish</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1436" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63631 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-4-Hour-Dec-22.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-4-Hour-Dec-22.png 1436w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-4-Hour-Dec-22-300x144.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-4-Hour-Dec-22-1024x491.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-4-Hour-Dec-22-768x368.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-4-Hour-Dec-22-750x359.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-4-Hour-Dec-22-1140x546.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1436px) 100vw, 1436px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">ADA/USD 4-Hour Chart</span></em></h6>
<p>On the 4-hour chart, ADA/USD risk is weighted to the downside as the pair develops below the firmly bearish 50 and 200 moving averages. With negative levels, technical indications have swung to the downside. The RSI, on the other hand, has not yet entered the oversold area, allowing for more selling.<br /><br />A break below the $0.250 horizontal support level might result in a larger loss, with investors looking for a move toward the $0.200 level. The price should hold at this position because this is a strong area of support. If the consolidation breaks down, the bears will be seeking a move toward the $0.150 area.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/moneygram-app-now-includes-crypto-trading-tools-for-bitcoin-ether-and-litecoin/">MoneyGram</a>, a former Ripple partner, and Frente Corretora, a current partner, have collaborated to launch a new <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/moneygram-launches-moneygram-online-mgo-website-in-brazil-301707173.html">remittance service</a> in Brazil with no fees for consumers. MoneyGram Online (MGO), a new service, allows customers to send money from Brazil to any country in the world in near real-time. Account deposit, mobile wallet, and cash pick-up from retail locations are among the services offered by the organization.<br /><br />MoneyGram Chairman and CEO Alex Holmes remarked:</p>
<p><em>“We’re confident that this launch will enable us to capture growth from new customer segments, deepen relationships with established customers, and create tremendous value for years to come.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/brazilian-congress-makes-move-to-regulate-cryptocurrency-payments/">Brazil</a> is becoming a more active user of cryptocurrencies and digital assets. Latin American remittances abroad have increased significantly in recent years, according to the World Bank.<br /><br />Furthermore, according to Accenture&#8217;s 2022 Global Consumer Payments Research, Latin America is only second to Asia Pacific in terms of the adoption of next-generation payment platforms.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Brazil ranks ninth in terms of cryptocurrency users. According to Bloomberg, 32.3 million Brazilians, or 19% of the population, use cryptocurrency.<br /><br />Furthermore, in the SEC v. Ripple action, a recent motion accepted MoneyGram and &#8220;third party A&#8217;s&#8221; request to redact documents filed in conjunction with Daubert filings. This was done to protect Ripple&#8217;s confidential business ventures as well as the lawful privacy interests of third parties.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/coinbase-reveals-over-33000000000-worth-of-bitcoin-in-its-reserves/">Coinbase</a> is one of the oldest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. It debuted in 2012 and has a dedicated fan base. The exchange was also among the first to welcome a large number of cryptocurrency enthusiasts.</p>
<p>The exchange just announced on one of its <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbase-secures-regulatory-approval-and-welcomes-new-country-director-in">blogs</a> that it has obtained a license to operate in Ireland.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Coinbase is delighted to announce that we have successfully registered with the Central Bank of Ireland as a Virtual Asset Service Provider, and to introduce Cormac Dinan as our new Country Director for Ireland.“</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the information, Coinbase has now secured an Irish virtual asset service provider license. The exchange will now be able to offer its services and goods to individuals in Ireland as a result of the license.<br /><br />Cormac Dinan was also named as the company&#8217;s new country director, according to the release. Dinan, who has more than 20 years of experience, will oversee the exchange&#8217;s activities in the country.<br /><br />According to the VASP, the exchange will be subject to the Criminal Justice Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Act of 2010.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to strengthening Ireland’s operations and helping the sector’s continued growth. <em>&#8220;Creating an environment which champions innovation while strengthening trust in crypto is something I am really eager to progress,&#8221;</em> said Cormac Dinan.<br /><br />Coinbase Europe Limited and Coinbase Custody International Limited are covered by the VASP. Since 2018, the exchange has also been operational in Ireland. The exchange can now offer its services across the country thanks to its recent registration with the Central Bank of Ireland.</p>
