<p>Curve Finance founder Michael Egorov has bought himself some breathing space after some backers, including Tron founder Justin Sun, stepped in to help after the decentralized protocol suffered a $47 million hack over the weekend.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-concerns-over-egorov-s-huge-loan-position"><strong>Concerns Over Egorov’s Huge Loan Position</strong></h2>



<p>Justin Sun and others have lined up to weather a bad debt crisis that could have potentially triggered a decentralized finance (DeFi) implosion.</p>



<p>To recap: The founder of Curve Finance Michael Egorov took around $100 million in loans across various lending protocols, which were backed by 47% of the circulating supply of Curve DAO (CRV).</p>



<p>The revelation about Egorov’s teetering financial situation came as Curve Finance was reeling from a hack. The DeFi exchange suffered an exploit on Sunday due to a vulnerability related to the Vyper contract-oriented programming language. Attackers <a href="https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1685794015915229184">siphoned </a>cryptocurrencies worth $47 million, including 7.19 million CRV tokens, worth approximately $4.52 million. This put considerable downward pressure on the price of CRV, putting Egorov’s multi-million-dollar lending position at a greater risk of liquidation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">2/ On <a href="https://twitter.com/AaveAave?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AaveAave</a>, Egorov has $305m CRV backing a 63.2m USDT loan.<br><br>At a liquidation threshold of 55%, his position is eligible for liquidation at 0.3767 CRV/USDT.<br><br>This would only require a ~33% drop in CRV price for this to occur. He is also paying ~4% APY for this loan. <a href="https://t.co/fbTgsF3xEg">pic.twitter.com/fbTgsF3xEg</a></p>&mdash; Delphi Digital (@Delphi_Digital) <a href="https://twitter.com/Delphi_Digital/status/1686187960939495424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 1, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The principal value of Egorov’s loan on Aave has, however, decreased from $63.3 million to $54.1 million thanks to a slew of wealthy participants. One is Justin Sun of Tron who acquired roughly 5 million CRV from Egorov for $2.3 million in an over-the-counter deal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sun noted in a Tuesday tweet that he was “excited to assist Curve”. “As steadfast partners, we remain committed to providing support whenever needed.”</p>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1686330181609496577">Data </a>from PeckShield indicates that other participants took the chance to snap up CRV tokens for cheap through OTC transactions after Sun’s purchases. Notably, Egorov sold 3.75 million CRV to NFT owner Jeffrey Huang aka Machi Big Brother, and later 2.5 million CRV tokens to Cream Finance.</p>



<p>On-chain data tracking website Lookonchain <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1686331352483082240">notes </a>that Egorov has sold a total of 39.25 million CRV for $0.4 per token and received around 15.8 million USDT in return.</p>

<p>A former official at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has cautioned that the legal predicament for Ripple Labs is about to get worse after a recent high-stakes court decision.</p>



<p>John Reed Stark cited the recent judgment made by the Southern District of New York District Judge, Jed Rakoff, which denied Terraform Labs&#8217; motion to dismiss the securities fraud lawsuit lodged against it by the SEC.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ripple-ruling-in-trouble"><strong>Ripple Ruling In Trouble?</strong></h2>



<p>The position of Ripple’s XRP in the market as a crypto and not a security token has once again come into question following Judge Jed Rakoff’s recent ruling.</p>



<p>The ruling indicates that the SEC can proceed with its case against Terraform Labs and its founder, Do Kwon, rejecting defense arguments that the U.S. regulator lacked jurisdiction and that Terraform&#8217;s algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD did not qualify as an unregistered security.</p>



<p>Critically, Rakoff refused to extend reasoning from a July court decision in favor of Ripple to the Terraform case.</p>



<p>In the Ripple lawsuit, a different judge — Judge Analisa Torres — determined that Ripple&#8217;s XRP sales to retail investors <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">did not break federal securities laws</a> because those buyers bought on secondary markets. But Rakoff stated that this &#8220;distinction between purchasers&#8221; does not apply under the Howey test that specifies whether crypto assets are securities.</p>



<p>Former SEC Chair of the Office of Internet Enforcement, John Reed Stark, <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnReedStark/status/1686150412317888512">suggested </a>that Judge Rakoff&#8217;s decision represents a significant victory for the SEC and could have severe repercussions on the ongoing Ripple case as the agency could potentially leverage this precedent to appeal against the landmark XRP ruling.</p>

In doing so, Judge Rakoff specifically rejected the distinction made in the Ripple case between public… <a href="https://t.co/JZZ8vukfFt">pic.twitter.com/JZZ8vukfFt</a></p>&mdash; John Reed Stark (@JohnReedStark) <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnReedStark/status/1686150412317888512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 31, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ripple-legal-chief-federal-judge-s-ruling-has-no-impact-on-xrp"><strong>Ripple Legal Chief: Federal Judge’s Ruling Has No Impact On XRP</strong></h2>



<p>Ripple’s chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty swiftly took to X to give the XRP community the much-needed assurance following the comments by the former SEC official.</p>



<p>Alderoty <a href="https://twitter.com/s_alderoty/status/1686161058770403328">noted </a>that the Terraform Labs decision has no bearing on Ripple’s ruling that XRP is not a security. He argued that the Terra case is only just commencing and the presiding judge has to accept everything the SEC avers as true. In contrast, Ripple’s judgment came after a full factual record created over two years was presented to the court.</p>



<p>Ripple’s chief technology officer David Schwartz also shared his opinion, <a href="https://twitter.com/JoelKatz/status/1686167529025150976">positing </a>that the decision in Terraform’s case was based on the “unusual properties” of that particular case and not on how crypto assets normally work.</p>



<p>Both Alderoty and Schwartz emphasized that although Judge Rakoff rejected the Ripple verdict, the heart of the disagreement revolved around the specific facts of each lawsuit and not a sweeping judgment on crypto assets.</p>

<p>On July 31, federal judge Jed Rakoff denied Terraform Labs&#8217; motion to dismiss the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit against their company and founder, Do Kwon. He refused to apply the logic from the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-verdict-ripple-chief-legal-officer-confident-in-another-win-should-sec-choose-to-appeal/">recent ruling in favor of Ripple Labs</a>, which determined that Ripple&#8217;s XRP sales did not violate federal securities laws because the sales were made to institutional investors and not to the general public.</p>



<p>The judge ruled that, according to the Howey legal test, it doesn&#8217;t matter how Terraform Labs initially sold their UST and LUNA cryptocurrencies (whether to wholesale or retail investors, in primary or secondary markets). What matters is whether those sales constituted the offering of securities that should have been properly registered with the SEC under U.S. securities laws.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that under the Howey test, if a cryptocurrency involves investing money in a common enterprise with the expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others, it is considered a security.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Remember when every influencer became a lawyer during the Ripple case and I was the only one who said it didn&#39;t make any sense?<br><br>Today, a fellow New York Judge issued an Order in the Terraform case explicitly attacking the Ripple decision and how it misinterprets the Howie test.… <a href="https://t.co/NGodxqm23z">pic.twitter.com/NGodxqm23z</a></p>&mdash; DiamondCruiser.eth (@Diamond_Cruiser) <a href="https://twitter.com/Diamond_Cruiser/status/1686352982982750208?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 1, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-judge-rakoff-rejected-terraform-labs-arguments-against-the-sec">Judge Rakoff rejected Terraform Labs&#8217; arguments against the SEC</h2>



<p>The judge dismissed&nbsp; Terraform Labs&#8217; claim that the SEC needed explicit congressional authorization to regulate stablecoins. He also considered that the SEC provided enough evidence that the company had allegedly fabricated adoption data of their cryptocurrencies to fraudulently promote them.</p>



<p>Rakoff stated that although the cryptocurrency industry holds some global significance, it is still &#8220;far from being a &#8216;part of the U.S. economy&#8217; with &#8216;substantial economic and political importance'&#8221;.</p>



<p>On February 16, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Terraform Labs and its founder, Do Kwon, for alleged securities fraud. The SEC accused Terraform of selling the stablecoin TerraUSD without properly registering it as a security and misleadingly promoting it to the public.</p>



<p>Additionally, they accused Do Kwon, who is currently out on a $430,000 bond, of allegedly orchestrating a billion-dollar fraud through the sale of TerraClassicUSD (USTC) and its connected cryptocurrency, Terra Luna Classic (LUNC), formerly known as Terra (LUNA) and TerraUSD (UST).</p>



<p>The SEC seeks restitution of illegally obtained investor funds from Terraform Labs and the imposition of civil penalties.</p>



<p>Although Judge Rakoff&#8217;s decision might be seen as a significant victory for the SEC in their campaign against the cryptocurrency industry, the lawsuit could still be dismissed on appeal or if a mutual agreement is reached.</p>



<p>Therefore, it is still too early for the thousands or millions of investors who lost their money due to the colossal fall of Terra to claim victory and rest easy. While regulators are assisting in recovering the lost funds, so far that money remains missing, and it is very difficult for it to be fully recovered. The complex legal and financial situation surrounding the collapse of Terra means it could take years to completely resolve it.</p>

<p>Bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network may finally see an end to its prolonged court battle with disgruntled customers after the company entered into a settlement agreement to address pending claims related to fraud allegations.</p>



<p>Based on a recent court document, a comprehensive settlement was reached with customers, addressing approximately 30,000 pending claims, totalling $78.2 billion. However, the main challenge for distributing these settlements by year-end is reconciling the claims, some of which involve fraud and misrepresentation issues.</p>



<p>If approved, account holders who choose not to opt out of the settlement will receive a 5% increase in their Account Holder Claims (excluding Custody Claims) as compensation for alleged damages resulting from the debtors&#8217; misconduct under the former management team. The Settlement will also address the class claim and other account holder claims; the document disclosed.</p>



<p>And while the court document is still in the proposal stage awaiting further developments, a crucial decision on the approval of the settlements is expected on August 10, followed by a confirmation hearing on Celsius&#8217; reorganization plan in October. Notably, if these legal processes proceed positively, customers may start receiving disbursements of cryptocurrencies and other assets before the year&#8217;s end.</p>



<p>Celsius Network&#8217;s journey into bankruptcy started approximately a year ago when it suspended all customer withdrawals following the implosion of FTX, making it one of the most notable crypto implosions to date. During its peak, the crypto lender boasted an impressive $30 billion in assets. However, by the time it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on July 13, 2022, its assets had plummeted to approximately $4.7 billion worth of crypto assets.</p>



<p>Since filing for bankruptcy, Celsius Network has been entangled in a complex situation, as some customers have sought damages, alleging misconduct by former management. In contrast, Celsius&#8217; lawyers have contended that customers are only entitled to their initial deposits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Adding to Celsius Network&#8217;s legal woes, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently filed a lawsuit against the company and its former CEO, Alex Mashinsky, for alleged fraudulent and unregistered sales, misleading investors, and price manipulation of a native token. On July 13, Mashinsky was reportedly <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ex-celsius-ceo-alex-mashinsky-arrested-as-sec-cftc-ftc-file-lawsuits-against-insolvent-crypto-lender/">arrested</a> in New York with the US Department of Justice (DOJ) accusing the businessman of orchestrating a &#8220;years-long scheme to mislead customers.&#8221;</p>



<p>In a statement, however,  the DOJ said that it would not prosecute Celsius in its capacity, as the company had taken responsibility for its involvement in the alleged fraudulent scheme and was actively cooperating with the authorities.</p>



<p>That said, the court approval for settlements and reorganization approaches, both the cryptocurrency community and Celsius Network&#8217;s customers are closely monitoring the developments. The resolution of these legal challenges will likely shape the company&#8217;s future trajectory and its efforts to rebuild trust and stability within the industry.</p>

<p>Apple has come under the spotlight over its App Store policies and potential constraints on emerging technologies.</p>



<p>On Friday, July 28, two lawmakers, Rep. Gus Bilirakis from Florida and Rep. Jan Schakowsky from Illinois, sent a bipartisan <a href="https://bilirakis.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/bilirakis.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/23.07.28-apple-app-store-blockchain-letter_0.pdf">letter</a> to Apple CEO Tim Cook expressing concerns about Apple&#8217;s App Store policies and how they may be restricting the growth of emerging technologies like blockchains, NFTs, and other distributed ledger technologies.</p>



<p>In the letter, the two, who are also high-ranking members of the Innovation, Data, and Commerce Subcommittee, sought information and documents from Apple to better understand the impact of these policies on American technological leadership.</p>



<p>This letter follows a previous inquiry from the lawmakers to Apple in November 2022, which focused on security vulnerabilities and foreign surveillance related to Chinese-originating apps, including TikTok. Although Apple has previously argued that its strict guidelines enhance security, lawmakers were concerned that these rules might be used to stifle competition and innovation.</p>



<p>“<em>While Apple has argued these limitations increase security by creating a walled garden, many are concerned that Apple has used the app store as a weapon against competitors</em>,”&nbsp;the two lawmakers said in a joint note. “<em>It is essential that Congress fully understand the App Store Guidelines and the extent to which these guidelines limit innovation and impact American technological leadership.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>However, the concerns raised in the letter specifically targeted instances where Apple&#8217;s policies have allegedly hindered blockchain and NFT-related apps from fully utilizing their potential.</p>



<p><em>“It appears that Apple has used its App Store guidelines to increase its own profits and reduce the utility of apps in blockchains, NFTs, and other blockchain-related technology,”</em> read the letter.</p>



<p>Notably, last December, Coinbase <a href="https://twitter.com/CoinbaseWallet/status/1598354819735031809">accused</a> Apple of demanding a 30% cut of gas fees associated with NFT transfers, claiming that such a requirement was not feasible within Apple&#8217;s in-app purchase system. Companies like Axie Infinity also faced challenges obtaining App Store approval for their blockchain-based apps, leading them to release limited versions that excluded core NFT mechanics.</p>



<p>To clarify these matters, the two lawmakers requested information from Apple about its app review processes, vetting of foreign ownership, and the potential for using the &#8220;secure element&#8221; in smartphones to support blockchain innovation and user data security.</p>



<p>That said, the lawmakers outlined eighteen questions they want to be answered by the technology company, including whether it plans to build apps using blockchain or related technologies, its app review processes and in-app purchase policies, among others. Apple is expected to respond by August 14th, 2023.</p>

<p>In a bid to provide regulatory clarity and foster innovation within the US cryptocurrency and blockchain industry, Representative Tom Emmer has reintroduced the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act (BCRA) for consideration by the financial services committee.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This bipartisan bill addresses the classification of blockchain-related entities as money transmitters. This long-standing issue has hindered progress and created confusion in the evolving digital asset space.</p>



<p>First introduced in 2018 by Emmer, the BCRA has undergone successive reintroductions, with Wednesday’s presentation marking its fifth consecutive Emmer-led effort, following a previous attempt in March of this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the bill&#8217;s reintroduction, Rep. Emmer emphasized the importance of regulatory certainty for the cryptocurrency and blockchain sector, recognizing the potential for the United States to lead in this innovative field.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;<em>The Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act is going to be marked up in the financial services committee today,&#8221;</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/GOPMajorityWhip/status/1684222538019139586">said</a> Rep. Emmer. &#8220;<em>Crypto and blockchain technology provide an important opportunity for our country to lead in the digital asset space. Today we&#8217;ve got an important opportunity to make progress towards providing regulatory certainty that benefits consumers and fosters innovation right here at home.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>In the financial services committee, &#8220;marked up&#8221; means reviewing, amending, and potentially voting on a bill before it goes to the full chamber for consideration. Committee members propose changes to the bill&#8217;s content during this process, refining it and addressing concerns. If the committee approves, the bill advances to the next stage of legislative review or Congress.</p>



<p>The primary focus of the BCRA is to address the ambiguous classification of blockchain entities as money transmitters, as the current state-by-state framework has created discrepancies and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/congressman-tom-emmer-more-concerned-now-that-secs-crypto-strategy-isnt-working/">stifled innovation</a> within the industry. Rep. Emmer stressed that the bill would bring much-needed clarity by differentiating blockchain developers and service providers who do not hold consumer funds from traditional money transmitters.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;A clear and consistent regulatory landscape will ensure we don&#8217;t drive this transformative technology overseas or drive American consumers to bad actors,&#8221; </em>Rep. Emmer added. &#8220;<em>This bill will allow blockchain innovation to thrive right here in the US, and I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues and the committee to get over the finish line.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>The BCRA&#8217;s reintroduction comes at a crucial time when the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry is experiencing rapid growth and increased interest from businesses, investors, and consumers in the US. However, due to the lack of a clear regulatory framework for the sector, firms have been threatening to move elsewhere, with some exchanges like Kraken, Coinbase and Binance US facing challenges with regulators.</p>



<p>That said, as the bill moves through the legislative process, the prospect of regulatory certainty is expected to attract more companies and entrepreneurs to invest in the US, fostering a favourable environment for innovation and reinforcing the country&#8217;s position as a global leader in the digital asset space.</p>

<p>According to the Bitcoin technical charts, a notable change has been spotted in the market. Since the start of the year, there has been a significant change in the structure of Bitcoin’s trading volume.</p>



<p>CryptoQuant, a leading on-chain data platform, took to Twitter to update the market on the new development and highlighted the potential changes that could be recorded in the long term.</p>



<p>The report revealed that the changes spotted might pioneer a new era of low volatility in the cryptocurrency market. This could further result in a turning point for cryptocurrency investors and traders.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptoquant_com/status/1685809330170503169?s=46&amp;t=qzsvHvtDB3yjTaoaylh-2g">data</a> from CryptoQuant reveals that there has been a sharp drop in the Spot vs Derivatives volume ratio. From January 11th till the present, the Spot vs Derivatives volume ratio has moved from 35% to 6%.</p>



<p>This marks a 29% drop within a 7 months time frame. Only 6% of the total Bitcoin trading volume is on the spot market. According to the report, the pattern suggests that investors are unwilling to sell their Bitcoins.</p>



<p>Despite the constant fluctuation in Bitcoin’s price, long-term holders seem committed to playing the long game, as they have collectively held back from partaking in active BTC sales since the year began.</p>



<p>As CryptoQuant explained;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>Bitcoin, like digital gold, is considered a valuable asset, and investors prefer to hold onto it for an extended period rather than sell it. This is seen in the BTC: Binary CDD chart. Since the start of the year, there have been no active sales among the cohort of LTHs.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the total Simple Moving Average (SMA-7d) trading volume of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-bull-cycle-still-intact-as-long-term-holders-demonstrate-low-selling-pressure/">Bitcoin</a> across all cryptocurrency exchanges has dropped from 2.5 million BTC in March to less than 600 thousand BTC in July. This marks a decline of more than 75% over five months.</p>



<p>This could also be a sole reflection of the maturation process of the cryptocurrency market. This could mean the market is becoming more stable and predictable and moving away from its previous volatile state. However, if the trend continues long-term, it could lead to significant changes in the Bitcoin market.</p>



<p>“<em>A decrease in spot volume may lead to a reduction in liquidity, which, in turn, could increase demand and the price of Bitcoin. The market currently lacks a new wave of optimism. The question is, where will it come from?” </em>Cryptoquant stated.</p>

<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has initiated a lawsuit against Richard Schueler, better known in the crypto world as Richard Heart, for unregistered offerings of three tokens: HEX, PulseChain, and PulseX. The SEC alleges that he raised over $1 billion through the unregistered offerings starting in 2019.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sec-sues-hex-founder-another-violation-of-securities-laws"><strong>SEC Sues Hex Founder; Another Violation Of Securities Laws</strong></h2>



<p>The founder of crypto project Hex has been sued by the U.S. SEC for violation of federal securities laws.</p>



<p>According to a July 31 complaint <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-143#:~:text=The%20Securities%20and%20Exchange%20Commission,in%20crypto%20assets%20from%20investors">filed </a>by the SEC in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Richard Heart raised around $1 billion via “the unregistered offer and sale of crypto asset securities”, which included HEX, PulseChain (PLS), and PulseX (PSLX).&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Heart began marketing Hex in 2018, claiming it was the first high-yield &#8216;blockchain certificate of deposit,&#8217; and began promoting Hex tokens as an investment designed to make people &#8216;rich,'&#8221; the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit read.</p>



<p>The American securities watchdog alleged that Heart defrauded investors both in the U.S. and abroad, and used the funds for luxurious personal goods. For instance, the SEC claims Heart misappropriated approximately $12.1 million of PulseChain investor funds to purchase luxury items like a 555-carat diamond, expensive watches, and high-end automobiles.</p>



<p>Heart bragged that Hex was “built to be the highest appreciating asset that has ever existed in the history of man.&#8221; The complaint also mentions frequent quotes from Heart’s YouTube live streams, including one in 2019 when he declared: &#8220;If you want to get rich, [Hex is] built for that.&#8221; He further posited that stated that Hex “was built to outperform Ethereum and Bitcoin and all other cryptocurrencies.'&#8221;</p>



<p>The SEC further points out that Heart touted PulseX through his public statements, forecasting that appreciation of “10,000x in two years is well within the realm of possibility.&#8221;</p>



<p>Nonetheless, the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit notes that Hex, PulseCoin, and PulseX have all seen massive price depreciation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“At present, PLS and PLSX are practically worthless, and Hex’s value has dropped about 98.4% below its all-time high,&#8221; the filing states.</p>



<p>The SEC said it was seeking permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against Heart and the projects. Heart, who was born in the U.S. but currently lives in Finland, was subject to a civil summons demanding he or his attorneys respond to the SEC lawsuit within 21 days or risk default judgment.</p>



<p>That being said, the suit is a continuation of the agency’s regulation-by-enforcement approach in the United States. The federal regulator is currently embroiled in lawsuits against prominent digital asset exchanges <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-suffers-double-whammy-as-sec-and-state-regulators-act-against-exchange-for-unregistered-securities/">Coinbase </a>and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">Binance</a>, among other industry leaders, for similar allegations of unregistered securities offerings.</p>

<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had asked Coinbase to cease trading in all cryptocurrencies except bitcoin (BTC) before taking legal action against America’s biggest crypto exchange last month. This is according to a <em>Financial Times</em> <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1f873dd5-df8f-4cfc-bb21-ef83ed11fb4d">report </a>citing CEO Brian Armstrong.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-armstrong-sec-directive-to-halt-trading-for-all-cryptocurrencies-except-bitcoin-would-end-crypto"><strong>Armstrong: SEC Directive To Halt Trading For All Cryptocurrencies Except Bitcoin Would End Crypto</strong></h2>



<p>Coinbase chief Brian Armstrong has disclosed that the SEC pressured the company to delist all crypto assets apart from Bitcoin.</p>



<p><em>“They came back to us, and they said [. . .] we believe every asset other than bitcoin is a security,” said Armstrong. “And, we said, well how are you coming to that conclusion, because that’s not our interpretation of the law. And they said, we’re not going to explain it to you, you need to delist every asset other than Bitcoin.”</em></p>



<p>It’s a similar view held by the SEC chairperson Gary Gensler, who <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-chair-gary-gensler-indirectly-declares-ether-is-a-security/">asserted </a>in a February interview that “everything other than Bitcoin” is a security under the commission’s purview.</p>



<p>As per Armstrong, if his company had complied with the request, it would have led to a bad precedent and might have prompted the regulator to crack down on most crypto businesses in the U.S. operating under similar conditions.</p>



<p><em>“We really didn’t have a choice at that point; delisting every asset other than Bitcoin, which by the way is not what the law says, would have essentially meant the end of the crypto industry in the US,” said Armstrong. “It kind of made it an easy choice [. . .] let’s go to court and find out what the court says.”</em></p>



<p>The SEC reportedly told the <em>Financial Times </em>that its enforcement division did not make any formal requests for the exchange to delist crypto assets.</p>



<p>In a June 6 suit, the SEC <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-suffers-double-whammy-as-sec-and-state-regulators-act-against-exchange-for-unregistered-securities/">alleged </a>that Coinbase was operating without registering as an exchange. The Wall Street regulator also claimed that the exchange’s staking service offered at least 13 cryptocurrencies that are actually securities, including tokens such as Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), and The Sandbox (SAND).&nbsp;</p>



<p>A day earlier, the SEC <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">filed </a>a similar complaint against Binance. The agency also alleged that Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao and the cryptocurrency exchange misused and commingled customers&#8217; funds.</p>



<p>The regulatory environment for cryptos in the U.S. remains murky despite Ripple<a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/"> scoring a partial victory </a>in a case against the SEC, with the judge ruling that Ripple&#8217;s XRP token is not a security.</p>



<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the SEC have both <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-ether-slump-as-cftc-sues-binance-and-cz-over-willful-violation-of-u-s-laws/">lodged</a> enforcement actions against industry leaders, contributing to the increasing regulatory uncertainty.</p>

<p>In a major development for the crypto community, Shibarium Beta Bridge has been <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-run-towards-0-001-shib-price-in-play-as-ethereum-to-shibarium-bridge-goes-live-in-beta/">launched for public testing</a>, bringing Shibarium mainnet closer to launch.</p>



<p>The news, which was announced late Wednesday by LUCIE, Shiba Inu&#8217;s top marketing strategist, has been generating a wave of excitement among cryptocurrency enthusiasts as the revolutionary layer 2 solution inches closer.</p>



<p>“<em>Shibarium Beta Bridge has gone live for public testing! Be among the first to try out this revolutionary cross-chain solution,”</em> wrote LUCIE on the X platform, formerly Twitter.</p>



<p>LUCIE, however, urged users to be cautious and verify authenticity before connecting their wallets to any website, emphasizing that they should not use their real assets during the testing phase. Instead, only faucets, which distribute small amounts of cryptocurrencies as rewards for easy tasks, should be used during testing.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-monster-move-draws-near-amid-imminent-launch-of-shibarium-in-august/">Shibarium</a> interface displayed in the images shared by the pundit reveals that the layer two protocol will allow staking, enabling users to send and receive crypto assets on the Shibarium network. The protocol also includes a bridge that facilitates deposits and withdrawals between different networks. Additionally, users can test moving their assets from the Ethereum blockchain to Shibarium during the beta testing phase, although the process may take 20-30 minutes.</p>



<p>Reports from users who jumped into testing within an hour of the announcement indicated a successful and positive experience. Many testers expressed excitement and satisfaction with the Shibarium bridge, citing its security and ease of use.</p>



<p>&#8220;<em>The Shibarium bridge test is amazingly good, safe and easy to use, between Shibarium and Ethereum. It&#8217;s unbelievably great, especially the security, congratulations to the whole team and UnificationUND,&#8221;</em> wrote one Shib enthusiast &#8220;Cryptolight.&#8221;</p>



<p>The team behind Shibarium has been <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-core-dev-teases-shibarium-launch-timeline-amid-super-bullish-strategy-for-shib/">dropping hints</a> about the imminent mainnet launch of the layer 2 solution for the Shiba Inu network, further fueling anticipation in the crypto community.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, the team launched a YouTube channel for Shibarium and released a video highlighting some of the upcoming network&#8217;s benefits, including increased security, transparency, and improved decentralization for the ecosystem.</p>



<p>The video also sheds light on using the Shibarium bridge for cross-network deposits and withdrawals, as well as the ability to stake holdings and earn rewards on the network. Additionally, it revealed that the Ethereum (ETH) network and Shibarium would mint the same number of tokens, ensuring a seamless transition between the two networks.</p>



<p>However, despite the growing excitement, the exact launch date for Shibarium&#8217;s mainnet remains unknown. While speculation points to the upcoming Blockchain Futurist Conference in Toronto in August as a possible launch platform, the team has not made any official announcements yet.</p>

<p>Popular blockchain platform <a href="https://zycrypto.com/tag/cardano">Cardano</a> has achieved a remarkable milestone which sets it apart from other blockchains. Cardano has demonstrated resilience and reliability with an unprecedented uptime of over 2,130 days, translating to an impressive 5.83 years.</p>



<p>While some networks suffer from occasional to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/the-apple-of-crypto-solana-sol-aims-for-crypto-crown-undeterred-by-network-outages/">frequent outages</a>, Cardano stands out with its perfect track record of zero downtime since its launch in 2017. This makes Cardano one of the most stable blockchain networks in the market, giving users constant, frictionless access to its services.</p>



<p>One of the key factors contributing to Cardano&#8217;s longevity and flawless performance is its design philosophy. Built to last, Cardano&#8217;s infrastructure is one of the few well-researched and peer-reviewed, which its founder Charles Hoskinson has always highlighted as one of its major strengths. Some have in the past criticized the approach, and it has meant that Cardano makes slower progress, albeit being steady.</p>



<p>The constant uptime and resilience of Cardano seem to win over people and increase user engagement. As of last Friday, the network recorded over 72,000 daily transactions, indicating a solid interest in Cardano&#8217;s capabilities.</p>



<p>With 3,182 active stake pools and nearly 23 billion ADA (Cardano&#8217;s native cryptocurrency) staked, community participation in the network remains vital. Stake pools play a critical role in the Cardano ecosystem, contributing to its decentralization and ensuring the security and efficiency of the blockchain. The substantial amount of ADA staked reflects the community&#8217;s confidence in the platform and its potential for long-term growth.</p>



<p>Charles Hoskinson made an interesting statement amid ongoing discussions among blockchain entrepreneurs over staking. Hoskinson said he stakes all of his ADA, illustrating his strong belief in the platform&#8217;s future.</p>



<p>In contrast, Ethereum&#8217;s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, recently shared his reservations about staking all his ETH holdings due to concerns about security implications. He said: <em>“If you stake your ETH, the keys that access it have to be public on some system that is unwind.”</em></p>



<p>Reacting to Buterin&#8217;s statement, Hoskinson expressed his surprise and disbelief, stating, “I had to listen to this a few times. I’m just at a loss for words,” Hoskinson said.</p>



<p>His dedication to the network&#8217;s success underscores the commitment of the Cardano team to deliver a cutting-edge platform that prioritizes security and user experience.</p>



<p>With a growing community and attracting more developers to the platform, Cardano will continue to improve and strengthen its network. As the crypto industry evolves, it will be interesting to see if Cardano can remain at the forefront of innovation and keep its spot in the top ten of crypto while adding more real-world use cases.</p>

<p>Stuart Alderoty, the Chief Legal Officer of Ripple Labs, has expressed strong confidence in the Court of Appeal, reaffirming the District Court&#8217;s ruling that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">XRP is not a security</a> if the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decides to challenge the decision.</p>



<p>Speaking during TechCrunch&#8217;s Chain Reaction podcast Tuesday, the lawyer discussed the significance of the recent court ruling by New York District Judge Analisa Torres on July 13. In the landmark decision, the judge declared that the XRP token does not fall under the category of securities when sold to the general public. However, she also stipulated that it can be deemed a security in the context of past sales to institutional clients.</p>



<p>The case outcome was hailed as a significant &#8220;win&#8221; by both Ripple Labs and the crypto community, offering a sense of regulatory direction for the much-debated digital asset.</p>



<p>Notably, while the verdict brought relief to Ripple, Alderoty asserted that the search for complete regulatory clarity is far from over.&nbsp; He further noted that despite the SEC&#8217;s persistence in claiming that the initial decision was &#8220;wrongly decided,&#8221; Ripple Labs remains resolute and ready to face any potential appeals.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“We don’t shy away from an appeal and I think the judge got that right and we think that was a faithful application of the law and I think a court of appeal will not only affirm that but maybe even amplify that to even a greater extent.”</em> Said Alderoty.</p>



<p>The possibility of the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/potential-sec-appeal-in-ripple-lawsuit-not-a-blow-to-xrp-legal-expert-reveals-why/">SEC appealing</a> the XRP decision was hinted at last week in legal documents from a separate case involving Terraform Labs. These documents mentioned the agency&#8217;s intention to explore alternative avenues for further review, indicating the possibility of further legal action regarding the classification of XRP.</p>



<p>That said, with the implications of this legal battle extending beyond Ripple&#8217;s immediate interests, industry experts have been sharing their perspectives on the possibility of an appeal, emphasizing the need for regulatory certainty to foster innovation in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space.</p>



<p>According to pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton, however, the SEC is likely to abandon the appeal route owing to differences between senior members of the agency, with some arguing against appealing, citing XRP&#8217;s uniqueness, while others advocate appealing to influence other judges. </p>



<p>“<em>Some will say don’t appeal, and the SEC can argue “facts and circumstances” and that XRP is a unique story, one not shared by other tokens,</em> “Deaton said on Tuesday. On the other hand, “<em>not appealing could signal acceptance of the Torres ruling,” </em>he added.</p>

<p>In a recent interview with CNBC, Rebecca Rettig, the Chief Legal Officer at Polygon Labs, revealed exciting developments for Polygon 2.0 that are bound to shake up the blockchain space. <a href="https://zycrypto.com/polygon-2-0-community-members-propose-new-and-improved-governance-framework/">Polygon 2.0</a> aims to integrate various chains, including ZK-EVM and other forward-thinking technologies that Polygon Labs developed to create a unified platform for the entire blockchain industry. This advancement is expected to pave the way for a blockchain-based internet and establish a value layer for the digital world.</p>



<p>Rettig talked about Polygon’s “value prop”, which was recently launched and has attracted interest from various industries, including policymakers, governments, and the general public. Value Prop is an open-source database showcasing blockchain use cases and innovations worldwide. Rettig said many had told her there was an &#8220;aha moment&#8221; when they realised that blockchain-based applications are already happening daily. Major brands like Starbucks, Disney, Sports Illustrated, and Ticketmaster are already integrating blockchain-based internet applications into their operations.</p>



<p>The value prop is an interactive resource with over 430 featured applications across various sectors, such as finance, healthcare, AI, and social media. Users can explore different use cases, including surprising applications like a blockchain-based solution for the California DMV. Notably, the platform has recently introduced &#8220;Impact Locale,&#8221; which showcases how certain blockchain applications are making positive social impacts worldwide.</p>



<p>Polygon Labs is also working on exciting updates for the value prop, incorporating video testimonials from developers explaining why blockchain technology is essential for their projects. In addition, people from all backgrounds will describe how blockchain-based apps have contributed to their lives. This effort intends to show that blockchain can be a force for good by highlighting real-world application cases.</p>



<p>Ms Rettig touched on regulatory questions and expressed her satisfaction with the recent Ripple court decision, which distinguished between securities and transactions in securities. Judge Torres had determined that XRP, as a software token, is not a security. The ruling highlights the importance of comprehensive legislation to manage the crypto asset market in the United States. Rettig said she believes that Congress must work on a broad-scale regulatory framework incorporating agencies such as the SEC and CFTC in ensuring clarity and consistency in the young but growing crypto market.</p>



<p>Rettig said: <em>“And I do think a comprehensive regime can be put together for the crypto asset markets in the United States that will bring the US in line with major other jurisdictions in the world such as the EU and Japan and the UK.”</em></p>



<p>As Polygon 2.0 continues its development and the value prop gains traction as a valuable educational resource, Polygon Labs seems to be in a good position to drive blockchain technology forward and empower the world with innovative solutions already reshaping various industries.</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC) continues to display a robust <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bullish-btc-signal-sec-formally-accepts-valkyrie-spot-bitcoin-etf-filing-for-review/">bullish outlook</a>, with long-term holders demonstrating a notable absence of selling pressure.</p>



<p>On July 26, Ki Young Ju, the CEO of crypto data analysis firm CryptoQuant, took to X to share insights on BTC&#8217;s current market behaviour, reaffirming the ongoing bullish sentiment.</p>



<p>According to Ki Young Ju, approximately 71% of the realized capitalization of Bitcoin remained unmoved for over six months. This data indicates that long-term holders are not rushing to sell their BTC holdings, contributing to the reduced selling pressure in the market. While low selling pressure doesn&#8217;t guarantee an immediate price increase, he noted that it does suggest that BTC is less likely to be at its cyclic top, providing a positive sign for investors and enthusiasts alike.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FO9nlrbC3bWZfkfqYSDsqX9M1UGhcAIZ2rKmeFaZz6sSHTJUUb5j0Dm0vnk9QGLsribF_pGVN7DaBsz1WSl9pdTvLZfyr_ZrEnT6iWiEunkZnNArGHkFKSuueosWCb8FIlEXfwKopGxvxPDHPofBmw" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Young&#8217;s findings align with those of on-chain analysis firm Glassnode, which recently reported that the Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Supply had achieved a new all-time high of 14.52 million BTC, equivalent to 75% of the circulating supply.<em> “This suggests HODLing is the preferred market dynamic amongst mature investors,”</em> Glassnode wrote on July 24.</p>



<p>Notably, data by the firm shows that long-term holders, or addresses that hold coins for 155 days or more, currently control roughly three-quarters of the total bitcoin in circulation (19.43BTC).</p>



<p>Elsewhere, another analyst at Cryptoquant, “IT Tech”, has recently offered valuable input on BTC&#8217;s behaviour during bull and bear markets. On Monday, the pundit highlighted the Long Term Holder SOPR (SMA 30) metric, emphasizing the significance of &#8220;level 1&#8221; as a key indicator in distinguishing between the two market phases. According to him, in a bear market, level 1 (Circled in yellow) acts as resistance, while in a bull market, it transforms into solid support.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/sw6Dq97oCqOsJ8Z8687S9ehVhdgon1DnSa9ToFDwUYuaLO6WQo1yjmqrvlD7nhec-hUCO-Mo3esX8W0ZydnR0OdG1P3-8DeMQXKb3sa_q24ZxglAvFzcl317uXPD_9r5y8W8Ls3k1PWzI2oqX91cMA" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Historic data from 2016 and 2020 showed that after crossing and holding level 1, Bitcoin entered the early bull market phase. The one exception was the period between 2019 and 2020, marred by the black swan event. The 30 SMA has since moved above the level, signalling the early phases of a bull market.</p>



<p>Despite positive indicators, Bitcoin&#8217;s price remains just below $30,000, with the U.S. Federal Reserve&#8217;s upcoming decision on a 25-basis point rate increase creating market uncertainty. Last month the price attempted to push higher following numerous ETF applications led by BlackRock fueling hopes of institutional investments before falling back into the current range.
