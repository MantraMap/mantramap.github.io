<p>Crypto.com promotes its very experienced and successful COO to president. Eric Anziani will now carry out both roles.</p>
<p>Eric Anziani, who is currently the Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Crypto.com, has been promoted to President of the company. In this expanded role, Anziani will continue to oversee operations and lead strategy, product, sales, international expansion, data, research, and blockchain integration.&nbsp;</p>
A key roll
<p>Anziani has been with Crypto.com since 2018 and has helped the company secure licences in various locations, grow its user base to over 70 million people, build its product and NFT offerings, advance Web3 innovation, and establish partnerships with prominent brands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anziani has extensive experience in the tech industry, having worked for Goldman Sachs, McKinsey, PayPal, and Global Fashion Group in various locations around the world.</p>
<p>Kris Marszalek, CEO of Crypto.com, said of the promotion:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eric is a leader and strategic thinker who has helped guide the Company&rsquo;s vision and solidified Crypto.com as a world-class platform built on security, compliance, and trust. Eric&rsquo;s expanded role will allow him full visibility of growth opportunities for the company and the ability to continue building and innovating to position Crypto.com for continued success.&rdquo;</p>

Advertising issues
<p>The UK's advertising regulator recently ruled against Crypto.com and Turtle United for promoting NFTs (non-fungible tokens) without clearly outlining the risks of investing in them or adequately disclosing transaction fees.&nbsp;</p>
Exchanges seek to prove financial stability
<p>This decision comes as crypto exchanges are trying to demonstrate their financial stability following the failure of FTX. On December 9th, FTX released a proof-of-reserves study conducted by Mazars, but the auditing firm later announced that it would no longer offer its services to the crypto industry.</p>
