At the second Eurasian Economic Forum, Putin explained that building this decentralized system would allow for a depoliticized global economic arena, contributing to withstand crises derived from major events.</strong></p>
<h2>Putin States a Decentralized Finance System Will Benefit the Global Economy</h2>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has remarked on the importance of building a decentralized financial system for the global economy. As part of a speech during the second Eurasian Economic Forum, Putin explained the several benefits that a decentralized system would bring to the world economy. He <a href="https://tass.com/economy/1622511" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course, the stability of all global finances will largely depend on this decentralization. The more de-centralized it is the better for the global economy. It will be less dependent on crisis developments in the countries that still have such an advantage as global reserve currencies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such decentralization of the financial system would bring better preparation for events like an eventual default of the U.S. debt, or a dramatic increase of inflation in the country, which would affect other countries using the U.S. dollar as a reserve and for international settlements.</p>
<p>In addition, Putin added that this decentralization will allow the depoliticization of the global economic arena, allowing for easier developments in the area.</p>

<h2>Payments Decentralization</h2>
<p>Part of this new decentralized global financial system that is being created has to do with the de-dollarization of payment channels around the world, and the switch to national currencies.</p>
<p>In this topic, the Russian Federation has been completing efforts to reduce the share of the U.S. dollar used for its international settlements, shifting to the use of the Chinese yuan and other national currencies with <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russia-and-china-carry-out-most-settlements-in-yuan-and-ruble-russian-pm-mikhail-mishustin-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">China</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russia-and-iran-phasing-out-us-dollar-in-bilateral-trade-settlements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iran</a>, due to the unilateral sanctions that the U.S. government enacted against it, freezing billions of dollars in the process.</p>
<p>However, Putin noted that other countries are also moving in this direction, stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many other fast-developing economies in the world are also shifting to the use of national currencies in foreign trade settlements, including China, India, Latin American countries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-nations-working-on-creating-new-currency-to-be-discussed-at-next-leaders-summit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">possible</a> issuance of a common currency for the BRICS bloc of countries, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/brics-working-on-new-global-reserve-currency-and-alternative-mechanism-for-intl-payments-vladimir-putin/articleshow/92407851.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> to be in discussion by Putin during the BRICS business forum last year, would also serve in this direction, allowing for the future development of alternative payment methods outside of the U.S. dollar and established traditional payment channel controls.</p>

Nation members could secure loans based on their energy-exporting capabilities, which would be liquid, and similar to the Special Drawing Rights (SDR) asset.</strong></p>
<h2>Roscongress Proposes BRICS Bank to Act as IMF Alternative</h2>
<p>Ronscongress Foundation, one of the more proficient Russian think tanks, has presented the idea of profiling the New Development Bank, also known as the BRICS bank, as a potential counterpart for traditional world financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>
<p>In its latest <a href="https://roscongress.org/materials/dekolonizatsiya-energotorgovli-ot-dollara-k-natsvalyutam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> about the de-dollarization of energy markets, Rosscongress profiles the New Development Bank as a credit institution among BRICS bloc members, having access to loans depending on its energy-exporting capabilities. The report states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Energy-exporting countries could borrow these funds for the projects they need, allowing them to increase trade in their national currencies despite trade imbalances. The New Development Bank could serve as a platform for securing such energy loans.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, these &#8220;energy loans,&#8221; similar to the IMF&#8217;s Special Drawing Rights (SDR), an international reserve asset, would be liquid and convertible due to their multicurrency nature. The future inclusion of more nations to the BRICS bloc would increase the volume of trade of these tools, the report suggests.</p>

<h2>A Shift to an Alternative Financial System</h2>
<p>The proposal is being discussed in Russian circles, with experts pondering it as a natural alternative to the current U.S. dollar-dominated financial system, which has allowed the enactment of unilateral sanctions against countries like China and Russia with economic sanctions. This is the opinion of Sergey Chevrychkin, a Russian financial analyst, who believes the world will flee to these alternatives due to fear of also facing these unilateral measures.</p>
<p>Chevrychkin <a href="https://iz.ru/1517209/2023-05-23/analitik-otcenil-ideiu-sdelat-novyi-bank-razvitiia-alternativoi-mvf-dlia-stran-briks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe that in the long run, these measures will destroy faith in the transnational protection of property rights and weaponize the global financial system.</p>

<p>Chevrychkin states that the future growth of the economies in the BRICS bloc, which is poised to surpass the aggregate share of the Group of the Seven (G7) countries in world economic growth by 2028, guarantees the establishment of a global financial institution for its nation countries.</p>
<p>The establishment of a BRICS bloc-wide currency would be another factor that would accelerate this shift. The issuance of such a currency will be <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-leaders-set-to-discuss-common-currency-to-challenge-us-dollar-dominance-in-upcoming-summit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussed</a> in the next BRICS summit to be held in South Africa in August.</p>

According to Circle, several decentralized finance (defi) protocols and projects are supporting the new AVAX-issued EUROC asset.</strong></p>
<h2>Circle&#8217;s EUROC Stablecoin Finds New Home on Avalanche Blockchain</h2>
<p>About 11 months ago, <a href="https://www.circle.com/en/">Circle</a> <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/circle-launches-second-major-stablecoin-backed-11-by-the-euro/">launched</a> the euro stablecoin called euro coin (EUROC) as its second major fiat-pegged token, following usd coin (USDC). The EUROC stablecoin was initially launched on the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC20 token. Currently, there are approximately 47.11 million EUROC in circulation, according to <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x1aBaEA1f7C830bD89Acc67eC4af516284b1bC33c">statistics</a> from etherscan.io. The euro-backed stablecoin issued by Circle is held by 1,381 unique Ethereum-based addresses.</p>
<p>On Twitter, Circle <a href="https://twitter.com/circle/status/1661720157138419713?s=20">announced</a> that EUROC will now be hosted natively on the proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain <a href="https://www.avax.network">Avalanche (AVAX)</a>. “It is official, [EUROC] is now multi-chain and live on [Avalanche] today,” Circle tweeted. “Developers can build on top of [eurocoin] on Avalanche to deliver faster, more efficient solutions for users to send, spend, save, lend, and borrow with a fully reserved, euro-backed stablecoin,” the company added.</p>
<p>Circle further <a href="https://twitter.com/circle/status/1661721745810653185?s=20">noted</a> that EUROC already has support from key defi applications and protocols like Curve Finance, Cable Finance, Trader Joe, Pangolin Dex, Benqi, and others. In a <a href="https://www.circle.com/blog/avalanche-euroc-expanding-access-to-the-euro">blog post</a> published on Thursday, Circle said that it also offers &#8220;access to Avalanche EUROC liquidity for qualified businesses with a Circle Account.&#8221;</p>
<p>Circle&#8217;s latest move follows the market capitalization of the firm&#8217;s stablecoin usd coin (USDC) dropping from a high of $55.9 billion on June 22, 2022, to the current $29.07 billion. The data shows that over the last 11 months, USDC&#8217;s market cap dropped by 47.99%. In comparison, EUROC is much smaller and holds the 410th position out of more than 10,000 crypto assets listed on Coingecko.com. EUROC&#8217;s market valuation accounts for 0.004% of the entire $1.15 trillion crypto market economy, while USDC represents 2.519%.</p>

Putin also rejected predictions about the “total collapse” of the Russian economy.</strong></p>
<h2>Russia &#8216;Actively&#8217; Cooperating With BRICS, SCO, ASEAN</h2>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke at the plenary session of the Eurasian Economic Forum on Wednesday. Among the topics he discussed were the state of Russia’s economy, the effects of Western sanctions, and cooperation with major international organizations, including the BRICS bloc and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (<a href="http://eng.sectsco.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SCO</a>). The BRICS group comprises Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.</p>
<p>&#8220;I consider the theme of the forum &#8216;Eurasian integration in a multipolar world,'&#8221; Putin described the annual forum of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU). The Russian president said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We see that really profound, fundamental changes are taking place in the global arena. More and more states are taking a course towards strengthening national sovereignty, pursuing independent domestic and foreign policies, and adhering to their own development model.</p></blockquote>
<p>Noting that these countries support the creation of a new, more just international economic order, Putin detailed that they are committed to constructively influencing global affairs and expanding the network of partnerships that are based on “mutual benefit, respect and consideration of each other&#8217;s interests.”</p>
<p>He added that countries that do not think and act this way are only exacerbating the downward trend of their own development, stating that they are shooting themselves in the foot. Emphasizing the importance of solidarity among countries globally, Putin said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We actively cooperate with major international associations such as BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization [SCO], the Association of Southeast Asian Nations [ASEAN], the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC], and multilateral organizations in Latin America and Africa.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Putin Insists Russian Economy Will Not Collapse</h2>
<p>Putin also discussed predictions regarding the potential collapse of the Russian economy. The Wall Street Journal, for example, published an article in March claiming that &#8220;Russia&#8217;s economy is starting to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/russias-economy-is-starting-to-come-undone-431a2878">come undone</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Russian leader opined: “The numbers speak for themselves: despite the large-scale crisis in the global economy and trade, considerable geopolitical risks and uncertainties, the total GDP of the Eurasian Union states for 2022 decreased, but decreased by 1.6 percent.&#8221; He added that some experts &#8220;predicted a completely different scenario, a collapse scenario.” Putin stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nothing like this is happening and has not happened and clearly will not happen again.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Let me remind you that both our experts and international experts for Russia already show GDP growth. At first, they talked about 0.7 percent. Let me remind you that in the leading economies of the European Union experts show a minus for the current year. At first, we were talking about plus 0.7%, now they say plus 1.5%, and maybe up to two percent. And that says a lot,” he detailed.</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) raised Russia&#8217;s GDP forecast in April to growth of 0.7% from 0.3% but lowered its 2024 forecast to 1.3% from 2.1%. The IMF expects labor shortages and the exodus of Western companies to harm Russia&#8217;s economy.</p>

The IMF chief does not expect the U.S. to default on its debt obligations.</strong></p>
<h2>US Dollar’s Reserve Currency Status Not at Risk, According to IMF</h2>
<p>The managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Kristalina Georgieva, expressed her confidence Wednesday at the Qatar Economic Forum in Doha, organized by Bloomberg, that the U.S. dollar will maintain its world&#8217;s reserve currency status.</p>
<p>Georgieva explained that despite growing de-dollarization discussions by various countries to decrease their dependence on the USD:</p>
<blockquote><p>We don&#8217;t expect a rapid shift in (dollar) reserves because the reason the dollar is a reserve currency is because of the strength of the U.S. economy and the depth of its capital markets … Don&#8217;t kiss your dollars goodbye just yet.</p></blockquote>
<p>A growing number of countries are ramping up their de-dollarization efforts. The BRICS economic bloc is pushing for the use of national currencies, instead of the USD, and is discussing creating a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-nations-working-on-creating-new-currency-to-be-discussed-at-next-leaders-summit/">common currency</a> that will help member nations reduce reliance on the US dollar. The BRICS comprises Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.</p>
<p>The proposal of a common currency is expected to be discussed by the BRICS leaders at their <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-leaders-set-to-discuss-common-currency-to-challenge-us-dollar-dominance-in-upcoming-summit/">upcoming summit</a>. In addition, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/10-southeast-asian-nations-challenge-dollar-dominance-with-push-for-local-currencies/">10 Southeast Asian countries</a>, members of ASEAN, also recently agreed to encourage the use of national currencies. This week, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/9-asian-countries-discuss-de-dollarization-measures-in-meeting-hosted-by-iran/">nine Asian countries</a> discussed de-dollarization measures in Tehran.</p>
<h2>US Default Unlikely, Says IMF Chief</h2>
<p>Commenting on the U.S. debt crisis, the IMF managing director said she is confident the United States would avoid a default.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/treasury-secretary-yellen-warns-us-could-default-on-its-debt-by-june-1/">Janet Yellen</a> has warned repeatedly that the Treasury may not be able to pay all of the government&#8217;s bills as early as June 1 “if Congress does not raise or suspend the debt limit before that time.” The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) similarly predicted that a U.S. default could occur in the first two weeks of June. Meanwhile, global investment bank <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/treasury-secretary-yellen-insists-us-could-default-on-june-1-goldman-sachs-estimates-real-deadline-is-a-week-later/">Goldman Sachs</a> said that the “real deadline” for a U.S. default is more like June 8-9.</p>
<p>Georgieva opined:</p>
<blockquote><p>History tells us that the U.S. would wrestle with this notion of default &#8230; but come the 11th hour it gets resolved and I have confidence we will see that play again.</p></blockquote>
<p>The IMF, however, recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/imf-warns-of-very-serious-repercussions-if-us-defaults-on-debt-obligations/">warned</a> of “very serious repercussions” on both the American and global economies if the U.S. defaults on its debt obligations.</p>

Officials of Maduro&#8217;s government appealed to the London Court of Appeals that the destitution of Juan Guaido, the former interim president, could affect the considerations London makes on access to the gold.</strong></p>
<h2>Venezuela Seeks to Regain Control of Its Gold Stash in UK</h2>
<p>Venezuela is again appealing the decision of the U.K. High Court on the ownership and management of more than $1.8 billion in gold that is currently held in the vaults of the Bank of England. This judicial battle has been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/banks-refusal-to-release-1-2b-of-venezuelan-gold-strengthens-the-case-for-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ongoing</a> since January 2019, when the U.K. High Court declined to transfer the gold to the government of Nicolas Maduro, on the basis of the U.K. government&#8217;s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-recognises-juan-guaido-as-interim-president-of-venezuela" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recognition</a> of then interim president Juan Guaido.</p>
<p>Guaido was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/disputed-venezuelan-gold-worth-1-8b-in-bank-of-england-vaults-remains-uncertain-after-dissolution-of-interim-government/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deposed</a> from his position as interim president in December 2022, when the Legislative Assembly, elected back in 2015, voted to disintegrate the interim government and establish a board to protect Venezuelan assets abroad.</p>
<p>This dissolution is key for the appeal presented by Richard Lissack, attorney of the Central Bank of Venezuela&#8217;s board managed by Maduro, who <a href="https://efectococuyo.com/politica/bcv-de-maduro-pide-tener-en-cuenta-destitucion-de-guaido-en-recurso-del-oro-venezolano-en-londres/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alleged</a> the London court should reconsider its posture due to the new political reality in Venezuela.</p>
<p>To Lissack, the &#8220;One Voice&#8221; doctrine, that determined the recognition of Guaido over Maduro, does not apply now that his government has been dissolved. Now, in his view, the government must recognize the decisions that Venezuelan courts enacted, disregarding the validity of the interim ad-hoc board of the Central Bank of Venezuela.</p>

<h2>Opposition and More Lawsuits</h2>
<p>Andrew Fulton, attorney of the &#8220;ad-hoc&#8221; board of the Central Bank of Venezuela, stated that these new developments don&#8217;t affect the outcome of the earlier decision of the court, given that Guaido was recognized as interim president of Venezuela when it took place.</p>
<p>A letter was <a href="https://twitter.com/planwac/status/1661002444992573442/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presented</a> that certifies that the U.K. government recognized and respected the disbandment of Guaido&#8217;s interim government on January 5, effectively changing the consideration of the U.K. government towards Guaido. On this, Fulton <a href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/spa/venezuela-oro_concluye-el-recurso-de-maduro-al-fallo-judicial-que-daba-a-la-oposici%C3%B3n-acceso-al-oro/48537976" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The members of Guaido&#8217;s board were appointed by executive acts of the then-recognized interim president, and such acts remain valid (in England) unless and until they are repudiated by a new president or government.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The U.K. court will dictate its decision in the coming weeks, as Maduro&#8217;s government is already preparing to introduce a new lawsuit to decide which party should have access to the gold after the Guaido government&#8217;s dissolution.</p>

Since then, Lido&#x2019;s market dominance has significantly increased over the last 12 months to its current 26.18% share.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Lido&#x2019;s Market Share in Liquid Staking <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> Derivatives Stands at 73%</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
The liquid staking protocol Lido Finance holds a prominent position in the world of DeFi. As of May 25, 2023, there is <a href="https://defillama.com">$46.6 billion locked</a> into defi applications and protocols, with Lido&#x2019;s total value locked (TVL) representing 26.18% of that amount. At the time of writing, 11:45 a.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, Lido&#x2019;s TVL stands at approximately $12.2 billion, according to metrics from defillama.com.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
According to Lido&#x2019;s <a href="https://lido.fi">website</a>, the current value locked in the protocol is $12.27 billion, with $12.11 billion representing ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>). The remaining portion of value held in Lido originates from networks such as Polkadot, Solana, Polygon, and Kusama. Lido&#x2019;s dominance of 26.18% is significantly greater than last year when the TVL in DeFi amounted to $111.11 billion.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220524145414/https://defillama.com/">Back then</a>, Lido&#x2019;s TVL amounted to $8.28 billion, accounting for 7.45% of the total value locked in DeFi on that day. A year ago, MakerDAO held the position as the most dominant DeFi protocol in terms of TVL, with 8.87% of the DeFi economy&#x2019;s value and $9.86 billion locked. Lido&#x2019;s dominance began to gain momentum <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230101205522/https://defillama.com/">at the start of 2023</a>, a time when the TVL in DeFi was merely $38.72 billion.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Archived data indicates that when the TVL in DeFi reached $38.72 billion, Lido&#x2019;s dominance stood at 15.24%. During that period, Lido&#x2019;s TVL amounted to only $5.9 billion. According to statistics from defillama.com, Lido commands a market share of 73.26% in liquid staking <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> derivatives, representing 9,128,624 locked ether. Out of the total 9.12 million ether, current statistics show that Lido holds 6,687,554 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
During the past 30 days, Lido <a href="https://defillama.com/lsd">experienced</a> an 8.91% change, whereas competitors in the liquid staking <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> derivative space such as Rocket Pool and Frax Ether saw double-digit gains. Rocket Pool recorded an increase of 32.18%, while Frax witnessed a rise of 42.25% over the past month. Coinbase&#x2019;s liquid staking <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> derivative stands as the second largest, with 1,128,662 ether locked, but it has experienced a reduction of 1.47% over the same period.&#13;<br />

DeSantis will confront the reigning president Joe Biden in addition to the existing presidential candidates: Donald Trump, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Nikki Haley, and Vivek Ramaswamy.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>DeSantis Reveals Presidential Aspirations</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Florida&#x2019;s incumbent Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, has set his sights on the presidency, announcing his candidacy for the next U.S. election. Challenging the current Democratic leader, Joe Biden, DeSantis <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1661498079386931206?s=20">revealed</a> his political ambitions during a Twitter Spaces event alongside <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/elon-musk-discusses-creating-ai-giant-to-challenge-google-microsoft-suggests-twitter-and-tesla-could-play-a-role/">Elon Musk</a>. Taking to Twitter, DeSantis further <a href="https://twitter.com/RonDeSantis/status/1661491799393964034?t=JoJrUROG7sJt3AfR8XSyMg&s=19">emphasized</a> his intentions, declaring, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m running for president to lead our great American comeback.&#x201D; The Florida governor also shared a video that says:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>Our border is a disaster. Crime infests our cities. The federal government makes it harder for families to make ends meet. And the president flounders.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#13;<br />
Unsurprisingly, DeSantis&#x2019; decision to unveil his presidential aspirations alongside Elon Musk on Twitter Spaces drew its fair share of criticism. To make matters worse, technical hiccups and sudden livestream disruptions plagued the event, rendering parts of the announcement nearly unbearable to endure. Addressing Musk, the determined candidate asserted, &#x201C;American decline is not inevitable, it is a choice, we should choose a new direction &#x2014; a path that will lead to American revitalization.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The Republican&#x2019;s Twitter event with Musk follows the footsteps of Democratic contender Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Republican hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy, both <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/clash-of-presidential-contenders-bitcoin-gains-prominence-as-2024-us-election-approaches/">announcing</a> their acceptance of bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) for campaign contributions. While DeSantis currently does not accept bitcoin, he has expressed positive sentiments toward the technology, setting him apart from Biden and Trump. In fact, he has voiced his support for implementing a Florida-based system that harnesses the potential of cryptocurrency assets for paying state fees on two separate occasions.&#13;<br />

At the end of December 2021, DeSantis <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/florida-governor-ron-desantis-proposes-creating-a-cryptocurrency-payment-system-for-state-fees/">introduced</a> his &#x201C;Freedom First Budget,&#x201D; outlining plans to establish a dedicated department in Florida for handling state fees using cryptocurrency assets. By March 2022, DeSantis provided an update, expressing his team&#x2019;s efforts in exploring avenues to enable businesses to settle their tax obligations with bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>). At that time, DeSantis <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/florida-governor-ron-desantis-says-state-is-figuring-out-ways-to-allow-businesses-to-pay-taxes-in-bitcoin/">asserted</a>:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>There&#x2019;s a difference between a decentralized digital cryptocurrency like bitcoin and what some are talking about doing at the federal level to convert U.S. dollars into basically a digital currency.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Another Four Years of Biden Could End up Killing Bitcoin, Says DeSantis</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
In addition to his comments about bitcoin, the governor of Florida has taken a bold stance by <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/governor-ron-desantis-signs-bill-prohibiting-use-of-central-bank-digital-currencies-in-florida/">prohibiting</a> the use of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) within the state. Defending this decision, DeSantis highlighted the potential risks associated with CBDCs, emphasizing concerns about invasions of privacy and centralized control over individuals&#x2019; financial transactions. The legislation enacting Florida&#x2019;s CBDC ban is set to go into effect on July 1, 2023, as outlined in the legislation&#x2019;s summary. <span style="font-weight: 400;">During the Twitter Spaces conversation, DeSantis said that he would fight against a CBDC on the national level if he was president.</span>&#13;<br />

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">DeSantis promised to protect people&#x2019;s rights to use bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) and he believes another four years of Biden will hurt the leading crypto asset. &#x201C;Bitcoin represents a threat to them,&#x201D; DeSantis said. &#x201C;They&#x2019;re trying to regulate it out of existence. The current regime they have it out for bitcoin. And if it continues for another four years, they&#x2019;ll probably end up killing it.&#x201D; The politician from Florida continued by asserting that America was veering off course and heading down a misguided path.</span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#x201C;We know our country&#x2019;s going in the wrong direction. We see it with our own eyes. And we feel it in our bones. Our president, while he lacks vigor, flounders in the face of our nation&#x2019;s challenges and he takes his cues from the woke mob,&#x201D; DeSantis said during the Twitter Spaces event.</span>&#13;<br />
