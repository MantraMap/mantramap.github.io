			  <description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every day, the crypto market springs up a new trend, and every day, investors seek means of navigating the market for profit. While coins like Bitcoin (BTC) have become huge and established, there are other coins showing promise of achieving the heights of established tokens.</p>
<p>Today, Rocket Pool (RPL) and Axie Infinity (AXS) are losing the faith of investors as their price value continues to go down in numbers. However, that cannot be said for Sparklo (SPRK) which is currently in its presale phase and gathering momentum as more investors look at investing in the project.</p>
<p>Rocket Pool (RPL) Experience Sharp Downward Trend in 24 Hours</p>
<p>The last 24 hours have seen Rocket Pool (RPL) lose -3.2% in its price value. This recent development is contrary to Rocket Pool's (RPL) rallying price in recent weeks. Standing at a current price of $46.38, Rocket Pool (RPL) is in a healthy run barring the downturn of the last 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rocket Pool (RPL) has experienced a +2.71% increase in price value in the last week and a 10.73% increase in the last 30 days. However, it is yet to be seen whether the latest downturn could signify the beginning of a bearish run.</p>
<p>Rocket Pool (RPL) has recently deployed an Atlas upgrade which lowered the amount of collateral required for Ethereum staking. This upgrade saw a rally in price. However, it looks like the effect of the upgrade has died down at the moment.</p>
<p>The market cap of Rocket Pool (RPL) stands at $896.51M and a trading volume of $8.13M in the last 24 hours. The circulation supply is 19.33M.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY SPARKLO TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Axie Infinity (AXS) Continues to Witness Dwindling Price Action</p>
<p>In the past year, Axie Infinity (AXS) has maintained a constant loss in the price of the token. While the last 24 hours have seen Axie Infinity (AXS) lose -1.9% of its price value, the trend is a long-established one as it has lost -3.6% in the last 7 days, -18.7% in the last 14 days and -11.0% in the last 30 days.</p>
<p>Standing at a current price of $7.59, Axie Infinity (AXS) has also witnessed dwindling statistics outside the market as the number of gamers that play the Axie Infinity game has gone down. Sources from Asia reported that Axie gamers in the Philippines are abandoning the Axie Infinity (AXS) game as they no longer make as much profit as they once did.</p>
<p>The market cap of Axie Infinity (AXS) is $877.924M while the trading volume of the last 24 hours is $29.996M. The circulating supply is 115.661M.</p>
<p>Sparklo (SPRK) Thrives as More Investors Troop in to Invest in the Project</p>
<p>Sparklo has continued to entice crypto investors as word spreads of the potential that the Sparklo project harbors. Still in its presale phase, Sparklo will be the first investment platform that allows investors to invest in real-world assets like Silver, Gold, and Platinum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Sparklo project will be an innovative blockchain investment platform with the potential to be the next blue-chip cryptocurrency in the industry. At just a price of only $0.017 per SPRK token, investors can jump on the presale phase before the price surges to an all-time high.</p>
<p>As most experienced investors know, investing in projects early is where significant gains are made. What's more, investors stand to get a 30% bonus once they purchase the token from now till the 5th of May.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means that investors will be getting 1300 SPRK when they purchase 1000 SPRK. That's why you need to take advantage of the ongoing bonus and purchase the coin now. After the 5th, the bonus won't be given again to those that buy the coin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe investing in Sparklo is an investment with room for growth and profit. Find out more details by following the information below.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s 2023, and investors are still reeling from last year&rsquo;s downward slide in the crypto market. The new focus is finding a crypto asset that can turn fortunes around very quickly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For this reason, Toncoin and OKB Exchange investors are taking a closer look at the much-talked-about newcomer, Tradecurve (TCRV), which is already showing all the good signs in its first phase of the presale.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tradecurve (TCRV) Sets the Precedent for Presales</p>
<p>Tradecurve is a trading exchange that has set itself apart from other exchanges. Tradecurve allows its users to seamlessly trade stocks, commodities, forex, and crypto from just one account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best part is, unlike most of the other exchanges, Tradecurve does away with all the tiring KYC requirements and lets users get in on the action without hassle. To open an account, customers simply submit an email address, connect their DeFi wallet and can begin trading instantly.</p>
<p>Tradecurve users will benefit from fast deposits, withdrawals, and order execution, the exchange realizes that time is essential for your success.</p>
<p>The biggest benefit of using the Tradecurve ecosystem is its low trading fees, Tradecurve users can rest assured that transaction fees won&rsquo;t affect their profits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the overwhelmingly positive prediction its native $TCRV token has garnered from experts, investors are purchasing the presale in record numbers with experts believing $TCRV could 50x in value once the presale has competed.</p>
<p>Toncoin (TON): The Crypto Shining Star That is Soon to Be Outshone</p>
<p>Toncoin (TON) is a third-generation blockchain based on the proof of stake model. It currently trades on six crypto exchanges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Toncoin (TON) was conceptualized by the same minds that birthed the Telegram Messenger, the Durov brothers. Some of Toncoin (TON)'s prominent strengths are its speedy transactions and low fees. Just like Tradecurve. Even in 2022, when the crypto market took a big hit, Toncoin (TON) steadied its ship pretty quickly and, to date, remains a darling of its investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Toncoin (TON) is top ten among crypto assets in terms of performance, even ahead of the big players like Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, the coin has slipped heavily from its all-time high and suffered low liquidity. Soon, analysts predict it will be no match for rising stars like Tradecurve.</p>
<p></p>
<p>OKB Exchange Should Brace Up for a Formidable Rival</p>
<p>OKB Exchange is one of the biggest survivors of the harsh crypto terrain of 2022. Still standing strong, the token retains immense love and support in the community. But analysts think that it should be wary of the newcomer, Tradecurve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Issued by the Blockchain Foundation, OKB Exchange (OKB) was founded in Hong Kong and launched in 2018. OKB Exchange users and holders benefit from mouth-watering interests in their stakes, plus a 25% discount on trading fees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>OKB exchange token trades on four crypto exchanges and is the second-highest crypto performer in the market. Its inflation rate and liquidity are impressive, plus its price has seen a 171% surge in the past year, beating Bitcoin and Ethereum hands down in the process. However, experts believe it should be wary of the Tradecurve wave.</p>
<p>Tradecurve is Set to Cause a Major Upset</p>
<p>Tradecurve is in its presale stage. Its current presale price is $0.01, for investors looking to get involved the best time to invest is now before it rises to its projected $0.048 closing presale price. Analysts predict that the coin will be 50x before the end of its presale and 100x by the time it launches.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The crypto market can be unpredictable. Regardless, investors are still on the lookout for new promising coins. Uwerx is one such cryptocurrency that has generated buzz in recent weeks as its presale keeps blowing up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uwerx is currently on the verge of selling out its third presale phase. The interest that Uwerx is generating is attributed mainly to its features and uses. In this article, we'll examine the features of Uwerx and why it's gaining momentum over Avalanche (AVAX) and Polygon (MATIC).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Avalanche (AVAX): Providing Effective DeFi Solutions</p>
<p>Avalanche (AVAX) is one of the fastest blockchain networks with robust capabilities. Some of its features include built-in support for decentralized finance (DeFi) apps, compatibility with other blockchains, and smart contract functionality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Avalanche (AVAX) currently trades at $14.84 with a trading volume of $109,659,557. Analysts predict a favorable price increase by Q4 2023 up to $25 as Avalanche (AVAX) has drawn the attention of investors and traders due to its technical prowess.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even though Avalanche (AVAX) tends to continue making waves in the blockchain industry, Uwerx is likely to surpass it by more than 6,000%thanks to its combination of security, utility, and strong market appeal.</p>
<p>Polygon (MATIC): Experience one of the Largest Blockchain Scaling Technology&nbsp;</p>
<p>Polygon (MATIC) is one of the most widely adopted cryptocurrency platforms. Companies like Disney and Starbucks are just a few of the well-known companies that have acknowledged the value that Polygon (MATIC) offers.</p>
<p>Polygon (MATIC) sells for $0.83, and analysts predict it&rsquo;ll reach $1.25 by Q3 2024 as its popularity and adoption grows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As fascinating as it sounds, the outlook is far from that of Uwerx. Its current presale feats have made this quite vivid, as its first and second phases sold out within 17 and 8 days after launching.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uwerx (WERX): Bringing a New Dimension to the Gig Economy&nbsp;</p>
<p>The gig industry is about to experience the biggest revolution ever. Platforms like Upwork, Freelancers.com, and Toptal have led the freelancing sector for several years. These platforms have generated billions in revenue without addressing the concerns of freelancers and clients. With Uwerx, all of these will come to an end.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uwerx is an upcoming freelancing platform based on the Polygon blockchain network. A significant advantage of Uwerx is that it'll utilize blockchain technology to provide users with the utmost transparency and security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, Uwerx will charge a substantially lower fee of 1% compared to the 20% fee charged by conventional platforms. There'll be several incentives and performance bonuses to win too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To erase doubts, Uwerx has passed audits by InterFi Network and SolidProof and is listed on CoinSniper. By August 1st, Uwerx will be listed on Uniswap. Also, the project's contract will be renounced when the taxes reduce to zero and just before Uwerx launches on centralized exchanges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why Uwerx (WERX) Presale is Selling Out Fast</p>
<p>The WERX token presale is in the third phase, and many tokens have been sold out. Each WERX token is worth $0.012; a 20% bonus is available on every purchase. The presale price will increase to $0.0225 by the 10th of May at 18:00 UTC. In addition, WERX tokens will be placed on a liquidity lock for 25 years shortly after the presale ends.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investors who need a means of storing their tokens will have the Uwerx Vault at their disposal. The Uwerx Vault will function similarly to the staking mechanism, and investors can store their tokens for varying durations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The optimized five-token allocations have undergone modifications to help the project adjust to the market&rsquo;s volatility. The presale access will be granted to 57% of WERX's total supply, up from the previous 45%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investors will be able to purchase additional tokens as a result of this adjustment. Also, the incentives for partnerships have also been decreased from 7.5% to 3% after the feedback from companies was analyzed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, the user performance incentive has been decreased from 15% to 6.5% in order to prevent long-term negative selling pressure. The joining incentive, which was originally 4.5%, has been increased to 6.5% in order to boost participation and activity. The marketing reserve and the liquidity reserve, however, both continue to be 10%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The token allocation for the stage four presale has been increased to 77.5 million tokens from the previous 60 million tokens. Also, a fifth presale phase has also been added, with 72.5 million tokens allocated to it. The hard-cap presale for Uwerx is anticipated to finish on July 31 as scheduled.</p>
<p>An alpha platform will be released during the third presale phase, and exciting features will be unveiled as the roadmap progresses. With over 3,500 users, the Uwerx platform is fast growing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As fascinating as it sounds, the outlook is far from that of Uwerx. Its current presale feats have made this quite vivid, as its first and second phases sold out within 17 and 8 days after launching.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uwerx (WERX): Bringing a New Dimension to the Gig Economy&nbsp;</p>
<p>The gig industry is about to experience the biggest revolution ever. Platforms like Upwork, Freelancers.com, and Toptal have led the freelancing sector for several years. These platforms have generated billions in revenue without addressing the concerns of freelancers and clients. With Uwerx, all of these will come to an end.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uwerx is an upcoming freelancing platform based on the Polygon blockchain network. A significant advantage of Uwerx is that it'll utilize blockchain technology to provide users with the utmost transparency and security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, Uwerx will charge a substantially lower fee of 1% compared to the 20% fee charged by conventional platforms. There'll be several incentives and performance bonuses to win too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To erase doubts, Uwerx has passed audits by InterFi Network and SolidProof and is listed on CoinSniper. By August 1st, Uwerx will be listed on Uniswap. Also, the project's contract will be renounced when the taxes reduce to zero and just before Uwerx launches on centralized exchanges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why Uwerx (WERX) Presale is Selling Out Fast</p>
<p>The WERX token presale is in the third phase, and many tokens have been sold out. Each WERX token is worth $0.012; a 20% bonus is available on every purchase. The presale price will increase to $0.0225 by the 10th of May at 18:00 UTC. In addition, WERX tokens will be placed on a liquidity lock for 25 years shortly after the presale ends.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investors who need a means of storing their tokens will have the Uwerx Vault at their disposal. The Uwerx Vault will function similarly to the staking mechanism, and investors can store their tokens for varying durations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The optimized five-token allocations have undergone modifications to help the project adjust to the market&rsquo;s volatility. The presale access will be granted to 57% of WERX's total supply, up from the previous 45%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investors will be able to purchase additional tokens as a result of this adjustment. Also, the incentives for partnerships have also been decreased from 7.5% to 3% after the feedback from companies was analyzed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, the user performance incentive has been decreased from 15% to 6.5% in order to prevent long-term negative selling pressure. The joining incentive, which was originally 4.5%, has been increased to 6.5% in order to boost participation and activity. The marketing reserve and the liquidity reserve, however, both continue to be 10%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The token allocation for the stage four presale has been increased to 77.5 million tokens from the previous 60 million tokens. Also, a fifth presale phase has also been added, with 72.5 million tokens allocated to it. The hard-cap presale for Uwerx is anticipated to finish on July 31 as scheduled.</p>
<p>An alpha platform will be released during the third presale phase, and exciting features will be unveiled as the roadmap progresses. With over 3,500 users, the Uwerx platform is fast growing.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The newest crypto trend watches new currencies like Enjin Coin (ENJ) come to the market and skyrocket, only to crash and be forgotten shortly later. Only a few fortified currencies can maintain the tenacity they launched with and still manage to hold their fort despite the market's volatility. Market experts suggest that crypto newcomer, Yachtify, is one such coin that will enjoy relative stability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yachtify (YCHT): Yachtify (YCHT) Gains Ground, Investors Swarm</p>
<p>Crypto newcomer, Yachtify, is increasingly gaining ground in the crypto space, with investors swarming to join its budding community. Its innovative approach to offering fractional yacht ownership to investors is attracting crypto enthusiasts to the scene, as it will enable them to have stakes in the recession-proof maritime industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the longest time, the ownership of luxury boats like jet skis and sunseeker yachts was exclusively for the extremely wealthy. Yachtify seeks to shatter that class barrier and offer its investment model to individuals across all wealth backgrounds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, with Yachtify, any cryptocurrency user can buy, sell, and rent yachts from anywhere in the world with affordable $100 stakes.</p>
<p>Yachtify enables investors to purchase fractional NFTs that represent a physical yacht for as low as $100. These yachts are heavily insured and are stored in maximum-security seaports worldwide. It also allows current yacht owners to raise funds by enabling them to list a minimum of 25% of their private yachts for fractional sales.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Yachtify team has undergone a Know Your Customer (KYC) assessment, so community members are confident in their investment. The founder was recently verified through an identity check, and SolidProof strictly audited the currency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The current presale value of Yachtify sits at just $0.10, and as any experienced investor will tell you, now is the time to get into a solid project with such impressive prospects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Early investment is one of the only ways to guarantee a tremendous profit, which is why you should follow this link before prices hit the roof:</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY YACHTIFY TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Market Experts Convinced that Enjin Coin Has Fallen Off</p>
<p>Enjin Coin (ENJ) is one of the few coins tied to a gaming platform. Unfortunately, it has been faring badly in the market as its value keeps declining.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Market experts predict that Enjin Coin (ENJ) will trip over and possibly crash, especially as new coins like Yachtify with stronger features capture the market. Unfortunately, the recent price trend of Enjin Coin (ENJ) is proving the predictions correct, as it is currently facing its 7-day all-time low of about $0.3636.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enjin Coin (ENJ) has little going on regarding a unique use case, and all its features are offered and enjoyed by more stable currencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Projects like Enjin Coin (ENJ) are flooding the market and causing investors significant losses while offering little to no value. Unlike these coins, Yachtify offers investors high yield and stability as it seeks to merge crypto's potential and the historically exclusive recession-proof maritime industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We highly recommend checking out and investing in Yachtify, the innovative crypto newcomer.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Have you missed out incredible meme coin gains from Dogecoin AND Shiba Inu?</p>
<p>Before you start beating yourself up for not having the foresight to see their potential, or for not having a time machine, remember that investing in cryptocurrencies is a risky game. The incredible gains of Dogecoin (DOGE)&nbsp; and Shiba Inu (SHIB) were fueled by a unique set of circumstances and the unpredictable nature of the market. It's important to approach cryptocurrency investments with caution, do thorough research, and understand the risks involved.</p>
<p>While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu's prices have experienced volatility, and past gains are no guarantee of future success, the impact it has had on the crypto world is undeniable. It has shown that even a seemingly whimsical meme coin can captivate the imagination of millions and provide extraordinary opportunities for those who dare to take a chance. In this article, we&rsquo;ll look at the past performances of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, and look at a new pup on the block that has the makings to be Dogecoin and Shiba Inu&rsquo;s successor: DogeMiyagi (MIYAGI).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dogecoin: The Life-Altering Gains You Could've Had If You Invested In Meme Coins</p>
<p>Established as a lighthearted joke in 2013, Dogecoin (DOGE) quickly gained popularity thanks to its adorable Shiba Inu mascot and the power of internet memes. And Elon Musk. But little did anyone know that this playful cryptocurrency had the potential to create life-altering wealth for some fortunate investors.</p>
<p>In May 2015, Dogecoin could be purchased for a mere $0.0001247. Fast forward to May 2021, when Dogecoin reached its peak with everyone aboard the hype train. At that time, the price of Dogecoin skyrocketed to an astonishing $0.6358. If you had invested $100 in Dogecoin back in May 2015, and you had held on until its peak in May 2021, that humble $100 investment would have inflated 509,764%!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just a little bit more than the returns you get on your savings accounts.</p>
<p>Shiba Inu: From Meme Coins to a Millionaire!</p>
<p>If you thought Dogecoin was the only meme coin that had the power to change lives, think again. Shiba Inu (SHIB), the canine-themed cryptocurrency that took the crypto world by storm, has its own tale of astronomical gains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cast your mind back to March 2021, when the price of 1 Shiba Inu token could be acquired for a minuscule $0.00000002. Fast forward to October 2021, when the frenzy around Shiba Inu reached its peak. The price per token skyrocketed to an incredible $0.00007924. The price surge is an astounding gain of over 396100%! Yes, you read that right. It's the stuff of crypto dreams.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Meme Coins, Missed Opportunities and DogeMiyagi</p>
<p>DogeMiyagi (MIYAGI) is not your ordinary cryptocurrency. It is a 100% community-driven project with plans to evolve into a fully-fledged Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO).&nbsp;</p>
<p>With its vibrant and supportive community, DogeMiyagi is all about overcoming adversity, showing resilience, and having a good time while doing it. It offers a space where like-minded individuals can come together to support each other, trade DogeMiyagi NFTs, engage in crypto discussions, and meme to their hearts' content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Built on the Ethereum blockchain, DogeMiyagi embraces the power of a green and sustainable future. Utilising the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, it is 99.9% more efficient than the energy-intensive Bitcoin. This not only makes DogeMiyagi more environmentally friendly but also positions it as a forward-thinking cryptocurrency with a conscience.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Additionally, being built on Ethereum comes with a myriad of advantages, including the ability to leverage the vast ecosystem of decentralised applications (DApps) for products such as The Killer Swap Machine, powered by Uniswap. It allows for seamless trading of the $MIYAGI token with other ERC-20 tokens and Ethereum. It's user-friendly and connects with MetaMask, making it accessible to crypto enthusiasts of all levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And let's not forget the DogeMiyagi NFTs! These artistic wonders not only pay homage to martial arts, doges, and Mr. Miyagi but also grant exclusive access to a unique domain and ecosystem. Get ready to unlock freebies and immerse yourself in the vibrant DogeMiyagi community.</p>
<p>With such a solid foundation, DogeMiyagi has all the makings to follow in the footsteps of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, becoming the next sensation in the meme coin realm. Don't let history repeat itself &ndash; join the DogeMiyagi dojo and embrace the potential for wild gains and delightful adventures in the crypto world!</p>
<p>So, as we reminisce about the life-altering gains one could have had with Dogecoin, Shiba Inu let it serve as a reminder that the world of cryptocurrencies is full of surprises. Who knows? The next hidden gem to blow up could be the humble DogeMiyagi. Stay vigilant, keep your paws on the pulse of the crypto market, and you might just be the next lucky investor to experience a life-altering financial journey.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The big development in cryptocurrency in 2023 seems increasingly likely to be the trajectory of Big Eyes Coin (BIG). As it closes out an impressive presale with one final special offer for investors not wanting to miss out, it&rsquo;s outlined a six-month roadmap charting its course to the crypto stars as it looks to become the biggest meme coin of them all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this article, we will look at all the reasons to be excited about Big Eyes Coin and also discuss how it compares to Floki Inu (FLOKI) and ApeCoin (APE).</p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin&rsquo;s Six-Month Roadmap Gives a Lot to be Excited About</p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin is making waves in the crypto world as it approaches the conclusion of its presale on June 3rd. The cat-themed meme coin has already generated an impressive $35 million in sales, leaving its rivals in awe. Offering a generous 300% bonus on all purchases with the code END300 until the end of its presale, Big Eyes Coin has utilised innovative methods to create and develop a strong community of investors.</p>
<p>The coin's success is due in part to its savvy use of social media, which has helped foster an inclusive atmosphere and promote its presale. Big Eyes Coin has employed a variety of strategies to boost earnings, such as offering loot boxes and time-limited bonus deals with bonus codes.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Big Eyes Coin has already outlined its plans for the future with a six&ndash;month roadmap to becoming a major force in the meme coin market, allowing it to challenge bigger and more established coins. To kick things off, the coin will be listed on Uniswap's (UNI) DEX on June 15th, with a potential CEX launch on Binance BNB (BNB) also in the works.</p>
<p>Over the next half-year, Big Eyes Coin has plans to list on several other exchanges including Gate.io, Bitget, BKEX, LBank, Deepcoin, and more. These listings will provide greater accessibility and exposure to the coin, attracting new investors and bolstering its position in the market.</p>
<p></p>
<p>By pursuing a multi-pronged approach to listing, Big Eyes Coin is positioning itself for long-term success in the meme coin market. The coin's development team is confident that these strategic moves will allow it to compete with other popular meme coins and capture a significant share of the market.</p>
<p>As part of its roadmap, on August 29th, it will launch its Big Casino, a gaming platform where users can win using BIG tokens. This exciting development is expected to further fuel demand for the coin, which is already being touted as a potential market leader once it goes live.</p>
<p>As a young project with impressive presale numbers, Big Eyes Coin is poised to make a big impact in the world of meme coins. Its unique approach to community building and innovative use of social media makes it a compelling choice for investors looking to capitalise on the latest fintech trends.</p>
<p>How Will It Compare to ApeCoin?</p>
<p>ApeCoin is a decentralised cryptocurrency that aims to provide a safe and secure platform for its users and has implemented several features whilst operating on the Ethereum network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its community is known for being very active and supportive with its team providing regular updates and engaging with its users. ApeCoin&rsquo;s ecosystem is widely regarded; its NFTs have been very successful and it has a reward system that innovatively encourages users to hold their tokens which can fuel demand for the APE currency.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Floki Inu is Powered by Its Incredible Community</p>
<p>If there is a coin that BIG can learn from it&rsquo;s Floki Inu. As a fellow community-driven meme coin, it&rsquo;s grown in popularity recently. It operates on the Ethereum network and has a fascinating ecosystem that includes a diverse range of fascinating features.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ecosystem comprises its Valhalla Play 2 Earn metaverse, its hub for DeFi projects known as FlokiFi, an NFT and merchandise marketplace called Flokiplaces. In addition, it includes its University of Floki which offers a richly detailed crypto education platform. There is reportedly a total circulation of 8.9 trillion FLOKI tokens with a maximum supply of 20 trillion and a market capitalization of $335 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the forefront of Floki Inu&rsquo;s sharp ascent is its ardent community known as the Floki Vikings.&nbsp;</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The big development in cryptocurrency in 2023 seems increasingly likely to be the trajectory of Big Eyes Coin (BIG). As it closes out an impressive presale with one final special offer for investors not wanting to miss out, it&rsquo;s outlined a six-month roadmap charting its course to the crypto stars as it looks to become the biggest meme coin of them all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this article, we will look at all the reasons to be excited about Big Eyes Coin and also discuss how it compares to Floki Inu (FLOKI) and ApeCoin (APE).</p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin&rsquo;s Six-Month Roadmap Gives a Lot to be Excited About</p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin is making waves in the crypto world as it approaches the conclusion of its presale on June 3rd. The cat-themed meme coin has already generated an impressive $35 million in sales, leaving its rivals in awe. Offering a generous 300% bonus on all purchases with the code END300 until the end of its presale, Big Eyes Coin has utilised innovative methods to create and develop a strong community of investors.</p>
<p>The coin's success is due in part to its savvy use of social media, which has helped foster an inclusive atmosphere and promote its presale. Big Eyes Coin has employed a variety of strategies to boost earnings, such as offering loot boxes and time-limited bonus deals with bonus codes.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Big Eyes Coin has already outlined its plans for the future with a six&ndash;month roadmap to becoming a major force in the meme coin market, allowing it to challenge bigger and more established coins. To kick things off, the coin will be listed on Uniswap's (UNI) DEX on June 15th, with a potential CEX launch on Binance BNB (BNB) also in the works.</p>
<p>Over the next half-year, Big Eyes Coin has plans to list on several other exchanges including Gate.io, Bitget, BKEX, LBank, Deepcoin, and more. These listings will provide greater accessibility and exposure to the coin, attracting new investors and bolstering its position in the market.</p>
<p></p>
<p>By pursuing a multi-pronged approach to listing, Big Eyes Coin is positioning itself for long-term success in the meme coin market. The coin's development team is confident that these strategic moves will allow it to compete with other popular meme coins and capture a significant share of the market.</p>
<p>As part of its roadmap, on August 29th, it will launch its Big Casino, a gaming platform where users can win using BIG tokens. This exciting development is expected to further fuel demand for the coin, which is already being touted as a potential market leader once it goes live.</p>
<p>As a young project with impressive presale numbers, Big Eyes Coin is poised to make a big impact in the world of meme coins. Its unique approach to community building and innovative use of social media makes it a compelling choice for investors looking to capitalise on the latest fintech trends.</p>
<p>How Will It Compare to ApeCoin?</p>
<p>ApeCoin is a decentralised cryptocurrency that aims to provide a safe and secure platform for its users and has implemented several features whilst operating on the Ethereum network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its community is known for being very active and supportive with its team providing regular updates and engaging with its users. ApeCoin&rsquo;s ecosystem is widely regarded; its NFTs have been very successful and it has a reward system that innovatively encourages users to hold their tokens which can fuel demand for the APE currency.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Floki Inu is Powered by Its Incredible Community</p>
<p>If there is a coin that BIG can learn from it&rsquo;s Floki Inu. As a fellow community-driven meme coin, it&rsquo;s grown in popularity recently. It operates on the Ethereum network and has a fascinating ecosystem that includes a diverse range of fascinating features.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ecosystem comprises its Valhalla Play 2 Earn metaverse, its hub for DeFi projects known as FlokiFi, an NFT and merchandise marketplace called Flokiplaces. In addition, it includes its University of Floki which offers a richly detailed crypto education platform. There is reportedly a total circulation of 8.9 trillion FLOKI tokens with a maximum supply of 20 trillion and a market capitalization of $335 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the forefront of Floki Inu&rsquo;s sharp ascent is its ardent community known as the Floki Vikings.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Developments and innovations never cease to excite investors in the crypto landscape. Coinbase&rsquo;s potential move to the UAE has dominated crypto news this week, as the CEO explores a clearer regulatory landscape. Meanwhile, DogeMiyagi (MIYAGI) has emerged with strong potential to become a top new crypto coin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coinbase Explores UAE as a Strategic Hub</p>
<p>Coinbase is one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges, and has been eyeing the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as a potential strategic hub. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and key executives from the exchange recently visited the UAE&rsquo;s Minister of Economy to discuss opening a new hub in the country. This move comes at a time when the crypto market is recovering from a dip and making significant gains. Armstrong and Coinbase executives have been working with regulators including Abu Dhabi Global Market and Dubai&rsquo;s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority to discuss expanding into the region.</p>
<p>While Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, has expressed concerns about the lack of clarity in US crypto regulations, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has been actively creating favorable conditions for cryptocurrency firms. In particular, Dubai has implemented a comprehensive legal framework for cryptocurrencies and established the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority. These progressive steps taken by the UAE make it an appealing destination not only for Coinbase but also for other companies operating in the crypto industry.</p>
<p></p>
<p>DogeMiyagi: The New Doge in the Crypto Community</p>
<p>DogeMiyagi is an exciting new meme coin project that has just entered presale. One of its key goals is to teach the industry valuable lessons on becoming stronger and better. While meme coins have often been deemed worthless, DogeMiyagi seeks to change this perception. It aims to be 100% secure and 100% community-driven, providing a trustworthy, utility driven coin while also being enjoyable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project is built on the Ethereum network giving users enhanced security and scalability. The coin is set to launch on Uniswap, a user-friendly decentralized exchange, which will enable effortless trading of $MIYAGI with various ERC20 tokens and Ethereum. Furthermore, DogeMiyagi has plans to expand into the web3 ecosystem by launching NFTs. This move aims to further solidify its presence in the crypto world and engage users in a new dimension of digital assets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DogeMiyagi will also foster a unique sense of community. With a DAO (decentralised autonomous organisation), the community will have complete control over the project, and have a part in key decisions through karate do &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and karate do &ldquo;no&rdquo; votes. By offering a stable and practical alternative to popular meme coins such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, DogeMiyagi is gaining significant attention.</p>
<p>The crypto landscape is constantly evolving, and Coinbase&rsquo;s plans to explore the UAE as a new strategic hub signifies the global significance of crypto. UAE&rsquo;s acceptance of crypto and precedent for crypto regulation could help the industry to thrive.</p>
<p>As a new meme coin, DogeMiyagi has emerged at the forefront of crypto innovation, capturing the attention of the crypto community with its unique approach and combining meme culture with token utility. DogeMiyagi is prepared to become a powerhouse in the meme coin arena, with a strong and sustainable ecosystem for investors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The realm of cryptocurrency is diverse and vast, with a plethora of coins in circulation. Meme coins are a particular type that has gained massive popularity and investment in recent times. One such meme coin is Big Eyes Coin, which stands out in the market due to its environmental focus.

With all these exciting developments, it's no surprise that Big Eyes Coin has become a buzzword in the world of cryptocurrency. Its unique approach to environmentalism, coupled with its innovative features, make it a promising investment option for those who want to make a positive impact while also making a profit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Exciting things to come for Big Eyes Coin. Over the six months, they will be listed on exchanges such as Gate.io, Bitget, BKEX, LBank, Deepcoin and many more! Stick around for these next six months to not miss the launch of these excellent exchanges.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>They say that when the crypto market hibernates, serious projects constructing the infrastructure of the industry are able to focus on building, without the background noise of hyped up tokens and bandwagons. Think of it like staying late in the office to catch up&mdash;no phone calls, nudging coworkers, or small talk. Just deep work.</p>
<p>So it seems there are more than a few serious projects in Web3 gaming. The industry was able to raise $4.5 billion in venture capital last year despite harsh market conditions. Web3 gaming still, however, needs solutions to an overall developer shortage and an abundance of flawed UX that effectively holds back its efforts to create crossover appeal with traditional gamers. Furthermore, many critics point the finger at the lack of sustainable models and solid content-creator strategies as reasons for Web3 not being able to be a reliable gaming ecosystem.</p>
<p>Leading blockchain startup Spielworks aims to fill these blindspots by launching Wombat X, a Web3 gaming accelerator to empower Web3 gaming projects to enhance their gaming experience and grow their audiences. The Wombat X accelerator enables innovative Web3 games to register and to bootstrap Spielworks&rsquo;s Wombat audience, one of the biggest Web3 gaming platforms. With more than 3 million sign-ups and 65,000 daily users, the Wombat ecosystem incorporates a multi-chain noncustodial Wombat Wallet, crypto rewards platform Womplay featuring 40 AA and AAA supported titles, and Top 20 NFT staking game Wombat Dungeon Master counting 1.5 million staked NFTs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Highlighting the list of partners in the accelerator are Cronos, the first EVM-compatible Layer-1 network built on Cosmos SDK supported by Crypto.com and more than 400 developers and partners, and Newcoin, a Web3 infrastructure integrating economic, social, and cultural exchanges into an intuitive flow, solving network fragmentation problems.</p>
<p>Spielworks CEO and Co-Founder Adrian Krion said of Wombat X: &ldquo;Web3 gaming is in a beta stage currently and there is a pressing need to establish best practices around game development to ensure the industry&rsquo;s long-term sustainability. By working with a wide range of promising Web3 gaming projects and startups, Wombat X aims to facilitate a more mature ecosystem. Our unique program provides a diverse educational curriculum while exposing our participants to Spielworks&rsquo; Wombat platform, the biggest Web3 gaming platform. Needless to say, we and all our partners can&rsquo;t wait to launch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With Wombat&rsquo;s massive audience and Cronos&rsquo;s established Web3 ecosystem, each game will receive invaluable exposure to its gaming audience for free, coaching and fast-tracking in Cronos&rsquo;s own grant program. For Newcoin, its Web3 graph infrastructure emphasizing high-end fashion and creators makes it a natural fit for Wombat X&rsquo;s focus on gaming to enhance the user experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To apply for Wombat X, applicants must meet these requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>A playable demo release</li>
<li>Integration with Wombat as preferred login option</li>
<li>Integration with Cronos or one of Wombat&rsquo;s supported blockchains (Wax, Polygon, BNB Chain, Ethereum, EOS, and more)</li>
<li>A share of 0.3 percent of your token supply for Wombat&rsquo;s audience</li>
<li>Integration with Wombat&rsquo;s Tracking software development kit (SDK)</li>
</ul>
<p>Other early participants in the Wombat X accelerator program include Web3 development studio Avicenne, open-source platform EOS Network Foundation, Web3 gaming analytics platform Lifty, and gaming infrastructure platform Beamable.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Image source: YARD Hub</p>

<p>&ldquo;...People need to be gently introduced to Web3 and guided around its abilities and power. In this sense, phygital and Web 2.5 are reasonable steps on the way to full-scale adoption.&rdquo;, he said</p>

<p>The Web3 industry has continued to make significant progress. More brands are trooping into this bright future, and many projects are being created, launched, or established. One such Web3 project already established is YARD Hub.</p>
<p>YARD Hub is a Web3 venture studio that facilitates the simultaneous creation of various Web3 startups. It further turns other entrepreneurs' or companies&rsquo; ideas into ventures by providing funds for these projects. As a venture studio, YARD Hub can quickly develop and test a product to see if it fits the market needs. It then scales this product if it passes the test and discards it if it does not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although YARD Hub is only two years down the line, it has already significantly impacted the Web3 industry. It has contributed immensely to creating, developing, and establishing successful Web3 ventures like DeepMine, Petobots, and CryptoAlma.</p>
<p>Well, the success of YARD Hub is tied to the brain and genius behind such a unique project, and he is no other than Yarosla Shakula. Yaroslav is a Web3 evangelist and serial entrepreneur who started his entrepreneurship journey very young. His passion for Web3 led to the creation of YARD Hub, where he hopes to contribute to the growth and revolution of the Web3 industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He has participated in award-winning projects, launched multi-million dollar ventures, and has continued to show interest in collaborations or partnerships with individuals or companies with ideas to push the industry further.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yaroslav&rsquo;s wisdom and immense contribution cannot be overemphasized. To further learn from him, we sat down with him and had some mindblowing conversations on the future of Web3, AI in Web3, the new Web2.5, and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hey Yaroslav, it&rsquo;s a pleasure to have you here. Please tell us more about yourself and what your journey to becoming a serial entrepreneur has been like.</p>
<p>I was born and grew up in Ukraine, where I completed my education as an interpreter and worked on copywriting for global brands. My journey into entrepreneurship encompassed ventures in affiliate marketing, AI, and e-commerce, but Web3 eventually captured my primary interest. Driven by a passion for discovering fresh concepts and developing products around them, I founded YARD Hub &mdash; a Web3-focused venture studio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have always believed in a Web3-powered future, and your passion for the industry led to the creation and establishment of YARD Hub. Please shed more light on what YARD Hub&nbsp; is all about, the work done there, and how it contributes to the growth of the Web3 industry.</p>
<p>As a Web3 venture studio, we simultaneously cultivate multiple Web3 startups with the assistance of our dedicated in-house team of entrepreneurs. The advantage of being a venture studio lies in our ability to rapidly develop, test, and either scale or discard projects based on their product-market fit. Currently, we have ventures in various Web3 domains, including two blockchain gaming projects &mdash; DeepMine and Petobots; the learn-to-earn educational platform CryptoAlma; an NFT-based car rental service; and a white-label crypto wallet solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a venture studio, YARD Hub&nbsp; focuses on helping startups launch their Web3 projects as well as granting users access to the best products in the industry. Could you further talk about the roles of venture studios in building the Web3 space and how it differs from accelerators and incubators even though they all have similar models?</p>
<p>I define a venture studio as an organization fully dedicated to systematically creating new ventures from scratch. Unlike accelerators or incubators, venture studios do not accept startups or external projects. Venture studios draw business ideas from their own network of resources and assign internal teams to develop them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it: most startups are likely to fail, while startups launched by venture studios are 30% more efficient. Venture studios help streamline the process of startup creation and mitigate the causes of key startup failures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Web3 space, venture studios and their portfolio projects are a safer bet for VCs to join Web3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Web3 industry has surged in the past few years and has been massively adopted by brands like Starbucks, Nike, and Porsche. However, these brands have yet to determine the best ways to adopt this technology to satisfy their customers&rsquo; needs and ensure a good experience. What do you think is the best way for them to go about this? Do you also think they should embrace DAOs? And why?</p>
<p>Big consumer brands have started to engage more actively with Web3 indeed, but it&rsquo;s not that there&rsquo;s some bulletproof &ldquo;best way&rdquo; to go Web3.</p>
<p>Nike and Adidas chose to consistently build their VR and metaverse experiences over several years, along with growing their Web3 communities, while Porsche decided not to go for a full-scale Web3 marketing campaign. This is not to say their NFT collection failed, I personally own several of their NFTs, but what I mean is different brands stick to different approaches to using Web3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Creating customer DAOs seems a really viable option for consumer brands in building their community the Web3 way. I believe Web3 will be about customers directly shaping brands' future. Brands will incentivize customers with tokens and NFT rewards, effectively categorizing their clientele based on loyalty and engagement. Customers will play an active role in determining the appearance and nature of upcoming products. This collaborative approach fulfills the aspirations of both brands and consumers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a recent jump from NFTs to Web2.5 or what most call Phygital, and brands like Nike and Porsche are already exploring this route to increase customers&rsquo; engagement and meet their needs. What are your thoughts on it, and do you think it will overshadow NFTs?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think phygital and Web 2.5 are some sort of intermediary stops on the way to Web3. Web3 involves a few new concepts, and people need to get seamlessly onboarded to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The emergence of Web3 is kind of similar to what we had with the internet around 1997: everyone&rsquo;s heard of that, and quite a number of people have tried using it, but years will pass before it becomes a totally common thing. Same with Web3: mass adoption won&rsquo;t happen overnight, but big brands embracing all this make a nice start.</p>
<p>When people start using NFTs first without knowing these are blockchain transactions (i.e., Starbucks loyalty program), small steps like this contribute to Web3 adoption.</p>
<p>People need to be gently introduced to Web3 and guided around its abilities and power. In this sense, as I said, phygital and Web 2.5 are reasonable steps on the way to full-scale adoption.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The increased AI hype has led to an attention shift from Web3. Do you think AI will last a long time, and in what ways do you think Web3 will integrate AI to increase the industry&rsquo;s capacities further?</p>
<p>What has recently been called AI, in fact, relates to machine learning and large language models (LLMs). Web3, in its turn, is often confused with crypto, which is not correct.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Web3 is an interface that allows users to interact with data and other parties through blockchain and decentralized apps, and as such, it might include AI but doesn&rsquo;t necessarily imply it. Web3 puts a huge focus on the input, support, and engagement from the community to help foster a sense of ownership and investment in the success of the project. From a set of clients, the community transforms into a &ldquo;customer parliament&rdquo; that can directly shape brands' future.</p>
<p>In YARD Hub, we focus on creating projects that have a very particular Web3 angle as we believe in the future driven by the mass adoption of Web3. We surely use ChatGPT in our everyday tasks, just like other builders. But Web3 and AI are two different areas of technology, and their mutual integration isn&rsquo;t a must. Both technologies are big enough to influence our everyday life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;...People need to be gently introduced to Web3 and guided around its abilities and power. In this sense, phygital and Web 2.5 are reasonable steps on the way to full-scale adoption.&rdquo;, he said</p>

<p>The Web3 industry has continued to make significant progress. More brands are trooping into this bright future, and many projects are being created, launched, or established. One such Web3 project already established is YARD Hub.</p>
<p>YARD Hub is a Web3 venture studio that facilitates the simultaneous creation of various Web3 startups. It further turns other entrepreneurs' or companies&rsquo; ideas into ventures by providing funds for these projects. As a venture studio, YARD Hub can quickly develop and test a product to see if it fits the market needs. It then scales this product if it passes the test and discards it if it does not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although YARD Hub is only two years down the line, it has already significantly impacted the Web3 industry. It has contributed immensely to creating, developing, and establishing successful Web3 ventures like DeepMine, Petobots, and CryptoAlma.</p>
<p>Well, the success of YARD Hub is tied to the brain and genius behind such a unique project, and he is no other than Yarosla Shakula. Yaroslav is a Web3 evangelist and serial entrepreneur who started his entrepreneurship journey very young. His passion for Web3 led to the creation of YARD Hub, where he hopes to contribute to the growth and revolution of the Web3 industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He has participated in award-winning projects, launched multi-million dollar ventures, and has continued to show interest in collaborations or partnerships with individuals or companies with ideas to push the industry further.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yaroslav&rsquo;s wisdom and immense contribution cannot be overemphasized. To further learn from him, we sat down with him and had some mindblowing conversations on the future of Web3, AI in Web3, the new Web2.5, and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hey Yaroslav, it&rsquo;s a pleasure to have you here. Please tell us more about yourself and what your journey to becoming a serial entrepreneur has been like.</p>
<p>I was born and grew up in Ukraine, where I completed my education as an interpreter and worked on copywriting for global brands. My journey into entrepreneurship encompassed ventures in affiliate marketing, AI, and e-commerce, but Web3 eventually captured my primary interest. Driven by a passion for discovering fresh concepts and developing products around them, I founded YARD Hub &mdash; a Web3-focused venture studio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have always believed in a Web3-powered future, and your passion for the industry led to the creation and establishment of YARD Hub. Please shed more light on what YARD Hub&nbsp; is all about, the work done there, and how it contributes to the growth of the Web3 industry.</p>
<p>As a Web3 venture studio, we simultaneously cultivate multiple Web3 startups with the assistance of our dedicated in-house team of entrepreneurs. The advantage of being a venture studio lies in our ability to rapidly develop, test, and either scale or discard projects based on their product-market fit. Currently, we have ventures in various Web3 domains, including two blockchain gaming projects &mdash; DeepMine and Petobots; the learn-to-earn educational platform CryptoAlma; an NFT-based car rental service; and a white-label crypto wallet solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a venture studio, YARD Hub&nbsp; focuses on helping startups launch their Web3 projects as well as granting users access to the best products in the industry. Could you further talk about the roles of venture studios in building the Web3 space and how it differs from accelerators and incubators even though they all have similar models?</p>
<p>I define a venture studio as an organization fully dedicated to systematically creating new ventures from scratch. Unlike accelerators or incubators, venture studios do not accept startups or external projects. Venture studios draw business ideas from their own network of resources and assign internal teams to develop them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it: most startups are likely to fail, while startups launched by venture studios are 30% more efficient. Venture studios help streamline the process of startup creation and mitigate the causes of key startup failures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Web3 space, venture studios and their portfolio projects are a safer bet for VCs to join Web3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Web3 industry has surged in the past few years and has been massively adopted by brands like Starbucks, Nike, and Porsche. However, these brands have yet to determine the best ways to adopt this technology to satisfy their customers&rsquo; needs and ensure a good experience. What do you think is the best way for them to go about this? Do you also think they should embrace DAOs? And why?</p>
<p>Big consumer brands have started to engage more actively with Web3 indeed, but it&rsquo;s not that there&rsquo;s some bulletproof &ldquo;best way&rdquo; to go Web3.</p>
<p>Nike and Adidas chose to consistently build their VR and metaverse experiences over several years, along with growing their Web3 communities, while Porsche decided not to go for a full-scale Web3 marketing campaign. This is not to say their NFT collection failed, I personally own several of their NFTs, but what I mean is different brands stick to different approaches to using Web3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Creating customer DAOs seems a really viable option for consumer brands in building their community the Web3 way. I believe Web3 will be about customers directly shaping brands' future. Brands will incentivize customers with tokens and NFT rewards, effectively categorizing their clientele based on loyalty and engagement. Customers will play an active role in determining the appearance and nature of upcoming products. This collaborative approach fulfills the aspirations of both brands and consumers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a recent jump from NFTs to Web2.5 or what most call Phygital, and brands like Nike and Porsche are already exploring this route to increase customers&rsquo; engagement and meet their needs. What are your thoughts on it, and do you think it will overshadow NFTs?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think phygital and Web 2.5 are some sort of intermediary stops on the way to Web3. Web3 involves a few new concepts, and people need to get seamlessly onboarded to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The emergence of Web3 is kind of similar to what we had with the internet around 1997: everyone&rsquo;s heard of that, and quite a number of people have tried using it, but years will pass before it becomes a totally common thing. Same with Web3: mass adoption won&rsquo;t happen overnight, but big brands embracing all this make a nice start.</p>
<p>When people start using NFTs first without knowing these are blockchain transactions (i.e., Starbucks loyalty program), small steps like this contribute to Web3 adoption.</p>
<p>People need to be gently introduced to Web3 and guided around its abilities and power. In this sense, as I said, phygital and Web 2.5 are reasonable steps on the way to full-scale adoption.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The increased AI hype has led to an attention shift from Web3. Do you think AI will last a long time, and in what ways do you think Web3 will integrate AI to increase the industry&rsquo;s capacities further?</p>
<p>What has recently been called AI, in fact, relates to machine learning and large language models (LLMs). Web3, in its turn, is often confused with crypto, which is not correct.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Web3 is an interface that allows users to interact with data and other parties through blockchain and decentralized apps, and as such, it might include AI but doesn&rsquo;t necessarily imply it.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s3">It's not uncommon for a cryptocurrency to face bearish trends for lengthy periods with little hope for recovery, thereby causing substantial losses to investors. Unfortunately, this is the current situation for the Axie Infinity (AXS) community. The disheartening trend is pushing investors to more stable crypto projects like the crypto newcomer, Yachtify.</p>
<p class="s3">Yachtify (YCHT) Takes the Lead in the Crypto Scene</p>
<p class="s3">Yachtify, a crypto new player, is projected to lead the crypto space in the coming seasons. Market trends are endorsing projections even before the currency's launch, and investors are swarming into the community, making solid investments with the potential to start earning a stable income. </p>
<p class="s3">Yachtify, a new coin with the potential to become a blue chip cryptocurrency, is designed to enable individuals worldwide to profit off the economy-proof maritime industry. </p>
<p class="s3">It is the first cryptocurrency investment project to allow investors to buy, sell and rent luxury boats so that investors can own shares in anything from a jet ski to a sunseeker. This model will enable the everyday crypto user to own, sell, and trade yacht shares, discarding the stereotype that delegates the market to extremely wealthy individuals.</p>
<p class="s3">Furthermore, Yachtify would allow investors to purchase fractional NFTs that represent real-life yachts with the Yachtify token ($YCHT). These yachts are strictly insured and secured in maximum-security seaports worldwide. </p>
<p class="s3">That's not all, though; current yacht owners can join the Yachtify community and raise funds by selling a minimum of 25% of their private yachts. All yachts will be sold or leased to high-net-worth persons, and the revenue will be disbursed to community members proportionally to their investments.</p>
<p class="s3">The Yachtify network and founder have been audited and verified by the SolidProof network. Yachtify will lock liquidity for life and freeze community tokens for three years, so it is completely for investors. </p>
<p class="s3">When dealing with a high-potential coin, it is always best to get invested early, and with a presale value of just $0.10, Yachtify is a no-brainer.</p>
<p class="s3">This is an incredible opportunity to get into an unbelievably stable cryptocurrency investment at an excellent price. Follow this link before the price becomes untouchable!</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY YACHTIFY TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s3">Axie Infinity (AXS): Future Wavers as Axie Infinity (AXS) Goes to Zero</p>
<p class="s3">Axie Infinity (AXS) is a blockchain cryptocurrency that is based on an online game. </p>
<p class="s3">It was developed by a Vietnamese gaming studio, Sky Mavis, and is run on the Ethereum network. It utilizes a play-to-earn feature that allows players to purchase, breed, and compete with creatures known as Axies in exchange for crypto tokens. </p>
<p class="s3">Cryptocurrency investors were still nursing losses as of April 23rd's unlocking of its Blockchain-based play-to-earn project's tokens worth millions of dollars. At the time, AXS's price was about $7.44, down about 12% that week alone. Market trends predict that Axie Infinity (AXS) will still drop. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="s3">Token unlocks are generally considered a bearish catalyst, mainly because holders benefiting from the unlock can sell their coins, thereby adding to the supply in the market. This may trigger more holders to sell their coins and cause a dip, which would be even more drastic for the Axie Infinity (AXS). </p>
<p class="s3">While there may be hopes that Axie Infinity (AXS) may rise again and find stability, investing in coins with stable prospects is best. Yachtify presents an attractive opportunity for investors to get in early on a solid project and earn massive revenue. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The world of cryptocurrencies keeps evolving with the emergence of cryptocurrencies with different use cases. There's been the development of NFTs, meme coins, stablecoins, and utility tokens, amongst others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uwerx, still in development, is a project with a different and unique focus. Traditional freelancing platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and others have existed for years without competition. Uwerx is coming up to offer better services and uses than conventional platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this article, we'll explore the features of Uwerx and why it's capturing the attention of investors worldwide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uwerx (WERX): Bringing Real-World Value to the Freelancing Industry&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uwerx is a fascinating project that promises to provide users with tangible and real use cases, unlike meme cryptocurrencies that lack real utility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some problems facing traditional freelancing platforms include a need for more trust, copyright violations, and third-party involvement. So, Uwerx will address the freelancing industry's several challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a clear vision and focused team, Uwerx will create a decentralized platform for the gig industry. Clients will be able to connect with professional freelancers seamlessly. And with an added layer of security, Uwerx will provide the first trustworthy blockchain-based freelancing platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, Uwerx will offer additional features like dispute resolution, signup bonuses, and performance incentives. There's no doubt that Uwerx will mark the beginning of a bright future for the freelancing world.</p>
<p>How is Uwerx (WERX) a Stand-Out Project?&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the vital features of Uwerx is its low transaction fees. Conventional platforms like Upwork and Fiverr charge about 20% and the high transaction fee concerns freelancers. The good news is, Uwerx is bringing a revolutionization and will only charge 1% on every transaction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another stand-out feature is its adoption of blockchain technology. Uwerx will provide secure and transparent transactions between freelancers and clients by leveraging blockchain technology. There'll be a reduced risk of fraud and copyright infringement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The developers will renounce contract ownership before Uwerx launches on centralized crypto exchanges and when all taxes reduce to zero. Before its listing on CoinSniper, Uwerx had undergone audits by InterFi Network and SolidProof.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, Uwerx launched its Vault on 28th April, and it'll operate similarly to the staking mechanism. The Uwerx Vault will permit users to store their tokens for variable durations, and they'll also receive incentives as determined by some factors on the Uwerx platform.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Uwerx is already making an impact on the market. Its first and second presale phases sold out in 17 and 8 days. Uwerx's developers will put the WERX tokens on a liquidity lock for 25 years immediately after the presale as a sign of dedication to the project.</p>
<p>Currently, the fourth presale phase is on, and each WERX token is selling for $0.012, and for every purchase, users will receive a bonus of 20%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uwerx has announced that presale access will be given to 57% of the entire supply of WERX, an increase from the prior 45%. As a result of this modification, investors will be able to buy more tokens. After examining the feedback from businesses, the incentives for partnerships were also reduced from 7.5% to 3%.</p>
<p>Additionally, to avoid long-term negative selling pressure, the user performance incentive has been reduced from 15% to 6.5%. And to enhance involvement and activity, the joining incentive, which was originally 4.5%, has been raised to 6.5%. However, both the marketing reserve and the liquidity reserve remain at 10%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The initial 60 million token allotment for the stage four presale has been increased to 77.5 million tokens. There is now a fifth presale round, with 72.5 million tokens reserved. It is anticipated that the hard-cap presale for Uwerx will end on July 31 as planned. This means investors have more time to purchase as many tokens as they desire.</p>
<p>The Uwerx platform has also amassed over 3,500 users. Join the expanding community of Uwerx and watch out for more exciting news using the links below:&nbsp;</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world of cryptocurrencies keeps evolving with the emergence of cryptocurrencies with different use cases. There's been the development of NFTs, meme coins, stablecoins, and utility tokens, amongst others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uwerx, still in development, is a project with a different and unique focus. Traditional freelancing platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and others have existed for years without competition. Uwerx is coming up to offer better services and uses than conventional platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this article, we'll explore the features of Uwerx and why it's capturing the attention of investors worldwide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uwerx (WERX): Bringing Real-World Value to the Freelancing Industry&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uwerx is a fascinating project that promises to provide users with tangible and real use cases, unlike meme cryptocurrencies that lack real utility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some problems facing traditional freelancing platforms include a need for more trust, copyright violations, and third-party involvement. So, Uwerx will address the freelancing industry's several challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a clear vision and focused team, Uwerx will create a decentralized platform for the gig industry. Clients will be able to connect with professional freelancers seamlessly. And with an added layer of security, Uwerx will provide the first trustworthy blockchain-based freelancing platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, Uwerx will offer additional features like dispute resolution, signup bonuses, and performance incentives. There's no doubt that Uwerx will mark the beginning of a bright future for the freelancing world.</p>
<p>How is Uwerx (WERX) a Stand-Out Project?&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the vital features of Uwerx is its low transaction fees. Conventional platforms like Upwork and Fiverr charge about 20% and the high transaction fee concerns freelancers. The good news is, Uwerx is bringing a revolutionization and will only charge 1% on every transaction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another stand-out feature is its adoption of blockchain technology. Uwerx will provide secure and transparent transactions between freelancers and clients by leveraging blockchain technology. There'll be a reduced risk of fraud and copyright infringement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The developers will renounce contract ownership before Uwerx launches on centralized crypto exchanges and when all taxes reduce to zero. Before its listing on CoinSniper, Uwerx had undergone audits by InterFi Network and SolidProof.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, Uwerx launched its Vault on 28th April, and it'll operate similarly to the staking mechanism. The Uwerx Vault will permit users to store their tokens for variable durations, and they'll also receive incentives as determined by some factors on the Uwerx platform.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Cryptocurrency market trends are now showing upward trends as the market is slowly getting back in shape. Investors are making moves and filling their portfolios with the right coin which will likely appreciate as the bull run commences. </p>
<p>Although some coins like Polkadot (DOT) and Pancakeswap (CAKE) are not having it easy in the current cryptocurrency market, Sparklo has become largely untroubled even in bearish moments. Sparklo has shown the most promise with analysts predicting a staggering 4,000% increase in value before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="s7">Pancakeswap (CAKE) plummets amidst bullish call</p>
<p>In the wake of cryptocurrencies' bullish trend, Pancakeswap (CAKE) has suffered a dip in price in recent weeks. Pancakeswap which a few months ago strengthened its position in the DeFi world after its partnership with Fewcha wallet as the native swap function has seen its value dip by almost 24.4% in the last 7 days according to Coingecko.</p>
<p>Pancakeswap (CAKE) price is $2.5 but experts have predicted that the price will shoot up as the bull run commences with a potential to reach $3.59 before the end of 2023. Although a proposed change to Pancakeswap tokenomics may give it a lifeline, investors should do their own research to take a strong position on Pancakeswap (CAKE).</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY SPARKLO TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s7">Concern as Polkadot (DOT) Suffers a Dip</p>
<p>The 51% increase in Polkadot (DOT) market cap in the first quarter of 2023 has not reflected in the coin market price as it suffers a dip in fortune. While most cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) posted impressive gains, Polkadot (DOT) has plummeted further with &nbsp;a 5.6% decline in value in the past three months. </p>
<p>Over the last 7 days, the dip has risen to 11% with a price value of $5.915. Although experts are predicting an upsurge in fortune, with a potential Polkadot (DOT) to reach $15 in 2023. Investors may have to take caution to see how events unfold.</p>
<p class="s7">Sparklo (SPRK) Revolutionizing Cryptocurrency as Presale Continues </p>
<p>Early adopters of Sparklo have been counting their gains as the value of Sparklo rises. Within a week, the coin has risen from $0.015 presale value to $0.017. Sparklo which prides itself as a platform that tokenizes physical assets such as gold, silver and platinum is currently enjoying an upshoot in the market with analysts predicting a whopping 4,000% increase soon. </p>
<p>With liquidity that will be locked for 100 years, Sparklo provides an opportunity to have in-store shops where physical gold, silver and platinum will be connected to the crypto market. This will allow investors to buy the physical assets using their minted NFTs. They can also use the minted NFTs to trade on the Sparklo platform with a little $0.01 charge as a transaction fee.</p>
<p>Sparklo is likely to be a game changer and the first of its kind in the cryptocurrency market. It is set to take a big leap in the near future.</p>
<p>With the current price of $0.017, this is a good time for investors to take advantage of this project. Sparklo is offering a 30% bonus to investors who purchase the coin from now till 5th May. What it means is that if you buy 10000 SPRK now, you will get 13000 in return. And this ends in a few days. So, take advantage of this opportunity and build your crypto portfolio now.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Arbitrum has been experiencing high levels of volatility, after the recent rally lost momentum, and the coin is now trading at a 20% loss on the two weekly.&nbsp; XRP is also down by 20%, this time over the 30 day chart, as the SEC vs XRP case drags on.&nbsp; Tradecurve, a new decentralized trading platform, in the first stage of presale, is out to challenge the big centralized exchanges, offering unparalleled access to financial products in a truly anonymous way.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Arbitrum&rsquo;s airdrop affects ARB&rsquo;s price</p>
<p>Arbitrum is yet another layer 2 based on Ethereum, and many are bullish on the blockchain due to its speed and low fee transactions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Stargate finance was the most used DApp on Arbitrum over the last 30 days, overtaking Uniswap, and suggesting that many people are bridging their funds in or out of Arbitrum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data from Defilama suggests that more money is going into Arbitrum, since the total value locked (TVL) has more than doubled since the start of the year. GMX and Uniswap account for about half of Arbitrum&rsquo;s TVL. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Arbitrum recently airdropped ARB tokens to early adopters, and so selling pressure from this may account for the recent volatility, drop in ARB price and also the increase in TVL.</p>
<p></p>
<p>SEC vs XRP continues their seemingly never ending war</p>
<p>About a month ago, XRP&rsquo;s lawyers were feeling confident that the SEC v XRP case would soon be wrapped up and settled in Ripple&rsquo;s favor, due to findings leaked from the case.&nbsp; The crypto community echoed the bullish sentiment and new people bought into the coin. &nbsp;</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Arbitrum has been experiencing high levels of volatility, after the recent rally lost momentum, and the coin is now trading at a 20% loss on the two weekly.&nbsp; XRP is also down by 20%, this time over the 30 day chart, as the SEC vs XRP case drags on.&nbsp; Tradecurve, a new decentralized trading platform, in the first stage of presale, is out to challenge the big centralized exchanges, offering unparalleled access to financial products in a truly anonymous way.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Arbitrum&rsquo;s airdrop affects ARB&rsquo;s price</p>
<p>Arbitrum is yet another layer 2 based on Ethereum, and many are bullish on the blockchain due to its speed and low fee transactions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Stargate finance was the most used DApp on Arbitrum over the last 30 days, overtaking Uniswap, and suggesting that many people are bridging their funds in or out of Arbitrum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data from Defilama suggests that more money is going into Arbitrum, since the total value locked (TVL) has more than doubled since the start of the year. GMX and Uniswap account for about half of Arbitrum&rsquo;s TVL. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Arbitrum recently airdropped ARB tokens to early adopters, and so selling pressure from this may account for the recent volatility, drop in ARB price and also the increase in TVL.</p>
<p></p>
<p>SEC vs XRP continues their seemingly never ending war</p>
<p>About a month ago, XRP&rsquo;s lawyers were feeling confident that the SEC v XRP case would soon be wrapped up and settled in Ripple&rsquo;s favor, due to findings leaked from the case.&nbsp; The crypto community echoed the bullish sentiment and new people bought into the coin. &nbsp;</p>
<p>While presumably most, if not all, of the crypto world would like to see XRP win this case, it should be remembered that SEC have never lost yet.&nbsp; Perhaps in a wish to maintain that record, the SEC seem to be deliberately delaying the XRP case, and so far costing Ripple over $200 million in legal fees. &nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Coinbase, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has come under fire from the PepeCoin meme coin community after an email to its customers described the popular meme as a "hate symbol" associated with alt-right groups. This has led to outrage and calls for an apology, as well as users deleting their Coinbase accounts and switching to other exchanges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ape Brigade (APES) is all set to launch its brand new DeFi meme coin, which has gained attention for its unique features.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coinbase Lashes Out at PEPE</p>
<p>Coinbase is facing backlash from the PepeCoin community after an email was sent to customers describing the meme as a "hate symbol" co-opted by alt-right groups. The email cited a 2016 decision by the Anti-Defamation League to place PEPE in its database of online hate symbols. Fans and holders of the meme coin were outraged, calling for an apology and even deleting their Coinbase accounts. The hashtag #deletecoinbase has been trending on Twitter with more than 14,000 tweets in the last two hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the backlash, Coinbase has not indicated whether it intends to list the PEPE token on its exchange. On the other hand, Gemini CEO Cameron Winkelvoss listened to the call, and the Winklevoss-owned crypto exchange listed the meme coin for trading on May 9 with a more open-ended description of the token.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PEPE's price fell 2.6% in the hours following news of Coinbase's description, and it is currently trading for $0.00000184, down 10.4% in the last 24 hours. Since Binance listed the token for trading on May 5, Pepe-holding members of Crypto Twitter have been asking leaders from various cryptocurrency exchanges to list the token.</p>
<p>Ape Brigade All Set to Launch!</p>
<p>Ape Brigade (APES), a new DeFi meme coin, is poised to enter the market with a range of innovative offerings. Despite being a new player, APES has already announced several unique features that make it stand out from the competition. For instance, the coin will lock 20% of its supply in a liquidity pool, ensuring that holders benefit when demand for the token increases.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>APES is also a technologically advanced ERC-20 token with an NFT Space in development. However, the most exciting feature is the incentivized staking system, which rewards APES stakers based on the amount and duration of their stake. All you need to do is patiently stake as many APES, and you have a chance to win rewards!</p>
<p>Ape Brigade's initiative to support and raise awareness about rescue efforts for wild animals, particularly apes, is perhaps its most compelling feature. A significant 10% of the total supply will go to charitable organizations that rescue apes and wildlife. All the unique offerings the project has in store for its community and the crypto industry as a whole is a clear indication that APES is a meme coin not to be taken lightly.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>30 days. That&rsquo;s how much longer we have until one of the biggest presales in the past 3 years comes to an end. If you pay attention to the bull market and meme coin corner of the crypto world at all, you&rsquo;ve likely heard of the project that is expected by many to become the next big thing, Big Eyes Coin (BIG). And if you haven&rsquo;t, you found this article at exactly the right time! It seems as though meme coin season is upon us again and the next Dogecoin Killer could be right around the corner, though this time the ones leading the new wave won&rsquo;t be dogs; it&rsquo;ll be a cat and a pair of frogs instead! As weird as that sounds, you&rsquo;ll understand exactly what that means as long as you keep reading!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jump Right into The Croak-pto Game With Pepe and Kermit</p>
<p>The story here is quite similar to the origins of the meme coin as a whole. Just as Dogecoin (DOGE) took its inspiration from the extremely popular Doge meme almost 10 years ago, these two crypto projects take their inspiration from a meme that could potentially be the quintessential meme that represents internet culture today. Pepe The Frog. Regardless of which social media platforms and websites you frequently use, you have 100% seen the Pepe meme and all its iterations. It&rsquo;s impossible to get away from. With that in mind, it&rsquo;s no wonder that the new age of meme coins would follow the same steps as their predecessor with their meme inspiration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PEPE (PEPE), of course named directly after said meme, has been on the receiving hand of exceptional growth and success since its debut in April, not even a complete month ago. Its momentum is incredible, spiking by 2,100% and reaching a $502 million market cap in such a short space of time. Pepe is already being compared to Dogecoin thanks to this, giving it the position of a real successor in many&rsquo;s eyes. It&rsquo;s even similar to it in that there is no real &ldquo;point&rdquo; to the token beyond being a fun alternative to other altcoins, though this has seemingly worked in PEPE&rsquo;s favour. That isn&rsquo;t to say all the new age meme coins are entirely focused on fun with no real utility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kermit takes its imagery from the most famous puppet in the world, Kermit the frog, it&rsquo;s undeniable that Pepe&rsquo;s meme power played a major role both in its reaction and success. Much like Pepe, Kermit launched just last month and has quickly built a following within the crypto community and it&rsquo;s not hard to see why. Beyond the interest it builds through the global influence of both the aforementioned muppet and meme, Kermit is actually a project with real value. It has no taxes, its LP has been burnt and its contract has been renounced, all working together to create a coin with high security and even higher return potential. There is one thing that Kermit missed out on though, something that could&rsquo;ve created an even stronger community to support it, which is a presale. Luckily, Big Eyes makes up for that.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Big Eyes, Big News, Big Plans</p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin (BIG), which has raised an incredible $35 million during its presale, has been making waves in the cryptocurrency community and is likely to continue making more with the announcement of the presale coming to an end 30 days from now on June 3rd. As the launch date approaches, the team promises to make more intriguing announcements that will make the project more alluring. Something we&rsquo;re already aware of that buyers have to look forward to is the Big Eyes NFT release! The NFT collection known as the Sushi Crew will include many fun and entertaining digital assets that are sure to capture the attention of every meme coin and NFT enthusiast around, including ones that feature the big eyed cat mascot and its hijinks. Not only are they exciting items to hold, but they will each have individual and exceptional attributes that will make them incredibly collectible and stand out. NFT&rsquo;s go hand in hand with the concept of meme coins, which makes Big Eyes&rsquo; focus on creating not only a collection but also a marketplace to trade them on a great step in pushing meme coins to the forefront once again! Though the presale will be coming to an end in a month, there is still one final thing that investors can get out of it! The final bonus code END300 gives users 300% extra tokens when used, so use it while you still can!</p>
