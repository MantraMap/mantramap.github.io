<ul>
<li>Transaction fees on Ethereum dropped 69% from April as the meme coin frenzy slowed down.</li>



<li>Experts say the reduced gas fees could be a positive boost for the overall network strength, increasing actual network utility. </li>



<li>A cross-section of users bemoans the use of meme coins to clog networks which results in high gas fees to the detriment of the community. </li>
</ul>



<p>The Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) networks suffered several congestion levels in May occasioned by meme coins and BTC Ordinals, respectively.</p>



<p>Gas fees on Ethereum have plummeted sharply by 69% over the last 30 days as a result of declining meme coin trading volumes. Transaction fees reached a 12-month high, hitting 140 gwei per activity. One gwei is equal to one billionth of one ETH. </p>



<p>PEPE was central to the surge as gas fees spiked by 50% since the launch of the token. Other meme coins like Aped (APED) and Bobo Coin (BOBO) also added to the surge and became more significant when they dominated the top 10 gas-burning altcoins. According to Santiment, PEPE, APED, etc. joined the usual dominant altcoins ETH, Wrapped Ethereum (WETH), and USDT. </p>



<p>Presently, the median gas fees cost about $7, which is approximately 24 gwei according to Dune analytics. The sharp decline in gas fees follows the fall of PEPE, which is down 70% from its all-time high within 30 days. PEPE has also fallen 14% in the past 24 hours since the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Binance for listing unregistered securities.</p>



<p>Experts have expressed optimism following the in transaction fees, adding that affordable fees lead to a stronger utility around a network. A cross-section of users is opposed to meme coins on their preferred network calling it “<em>anti utility” </em>and an easy way to lose one’s value. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-btc-ordinals-put-bitcoin-down-the-same-path"><strong>BTC Ordinals put Bitcoin down the same path</strong></h2>



<p>With Bitcoin also receiving its fair share, May was the month of increased gas fees across networks. Last month, BTC Ordinals hit 10 million inscriptions, spiking transaction volumes on the network to new highs.</p>



<p>As a result, network fees surged up to $20 per transaction leading to mass complaints and a temporary <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoins-surging-transaction-fees-viewed-as-direct-attack-by-a-cross-section-of-the-community/">halt</a> of withdrawals by leading crypto exchange, Binance. At the time of Binance’s announcement, there were more than 420,000 transactions in the mempool.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ordinals recorded about 2.5 million inscriptions across the week, during which the network suffered congestion, with some users calling it an “<em>attack” </em>on the network.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Metropolitan Museum of Arts is set to return all the funds it received from FTX after an agreement with debtors.</li>



<li>Over 180 United States politicians received funding from FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried, with only 19 fully returning the funds or showing keen interest in doing so.</li>



<li>In a related development, digital asset firms and influencers exercise “<em>double caution” </em>as their sieve through endorsement deals. </li>
</ul>



<p>According to court documents, a total of $93 million was handed out by FTX in donations between March 2020 and November 2022, creating a dilemma for recipients.</p>



<p>The Metropolitan Museum of Art has confirmed its intention to return donations received from FTX to its debtors. The New York-based museum stated in a filing to the United States Bankruptcy Court in Delaware that after discussions the agreement to return came in “good faith, arm’s length negotiations” with debtors.</p>



<p>“<em>The Met wishes to return the Donations to the FTX Debtors, and the FTX Debtors and the Met have engaged in good faith, arm’s length negotiations concerning the return of the Donations,” </em>the filing states.</p>



<p>The Met has received a total of $550,000 across two installments from FTX facilitated by West Realm Shires Services, the firm behind the daily operations of FTX. The first payment ($300,000) was received in March 2022 while the second ($250,000) came two months later in May.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since its collapse in November, the management of FTX has been tasked with getting back funds that were donated by Sam Bankman-Fried while it was a going concern. In the United States alone, about 180 politicians have been linked to receiving funds from FTX while only 19 have either returned or shown keen interest to do so as debtors remain stranded.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-returns-keep-flowing-in">Returns keep flowing in</h2>



<p>Court documents show that FTX handed out $93 million in <a href="https://zycrypto.com/give-it-back-ftx-debtors-demand-return-of-93-million-donations-from-us-politicians/">donations</a> to several agencies and individuals. The biggest beneficiary remains the “Protect our Future PAC”, which received $27 million, according to reports from Market Watch. </p>



<p>Since the fall of the exchange, politicians and organizations have continued returning funds to debtors. The Alignment Research Center has said that it will return the $1.25 million received from the company stating that the funds “<em>money morally belongs to FTX customers or creditors” and was a “particularly straightforward decision.”</em></p>



<p>The University of Toronto has set plans in motion to return $500,000 it received from FTX. Similarly, ProPublica would also return the $1.6 million it received. So far, new CEO John Ray has recovered about $6.2 billion in assets.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>As the SEC continues its onslaught on the sector, Proof-of-Work assets appear to be exempted, leaving Proof-of-Stake counterparts at the mercy of regulators.</li>



<li>Experts cite the centralization of assets and staking as factors in determining which assets get the stick from regulators.</li>



<li>Proof-of-Work may be safe from the financial market regulators, but climate concerns remain a hurdle.</li>
</ul>



<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has intensified its efforts in regulating digital assets in what many have described as a “<em>lopsided process</em>” against several assets.</p>



<p>On June 5, the SEC <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">filed</a> charges against Binance and Coinbase for allegedly offering trading services to unregistered securities, improper registration on the part of Binance US and Coinbase staking services. The big question on the minds of observers has been, “<em>How did the SEC determine which assets are securities?”</em></p>



<p>The SEC and other United States regulators have failed to conclusively answer that question leading to a lack of clarity and uncertainty in regulatory policies. Following the lawsuits, some analysts have shared their views on what they believe to be the Commission’s logic.</p>



<p>Steven Lubka, the Managing Director of Swan Bitcoin, opines that Proof-of-Work (PoW) assets are not flagged by regulators because a central body does not issue them.</p>



<p>“<em>I think PoW coins are largely avoided because there is no central issuer. Generally speaking, PoW is an open mechanism and lacks a central issuer, unlike PoS coins,” </em>he explained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To others, staking is integral to the decision as users lock up assets in anticipation of a reward given by a “<em>central body.” </em>Vineeth Bhuvanagiri, the Chief Executive of Emurgu, taking a swipe at Gary Gensler feels that the decision is based on the popularity of a coin. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-proof-of-work-dodges-bullet-but-is-still-within-range"><strong>Proof-of-Work dodges bullet but is still within range</strong></h2>



<p>From legal filings against Coinbase, the Commission focused on Proof-of-Stake (PoS) assets like Filecoin (FIL), Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), Solana (SOL), etc, excluding PoW networks. Gary Gensler has also stated in the past that Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency he can refer to as a commodity because of its structure.</p>



<p>Despite these, the PoW community should not feel too comfortable because the energy consumption of their favourite assets has been a concern for many governments. In 2021, China <a href="https://zycrypto.com/after-banning-cryptocurrencies-china-set-to-release-a-blockchain-national-standard-in-2022/">clamped</a> down on miners citing environmental concerns as cities fell below their climate quota.</p>



<p>According to the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index, electricity spent on mining Bitcoin globally is at similar levels to Argentina’s electricity usage. This has led to activists clamouring for policy changes that could affect these assets even more than financial regulators. Last month, the White House proposed a 30% tax on crypto mining, stressing their negative community impact.</p>

<p>In a recent piece titled &#8220;Regulation by Enforcement in the Digital Asset Industry: A Lagging Response to Stale Facts”, Karen Ubell, Mitzi Chang, and Adam Bruce of the Goodwin law firm shed light on the ineffectiveness of regulation by enforcement in the digital asset industry. The experts particularly argued that the focus on enforcement actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had done little to clarify regulatory expectations concerning current facts and market practices.</p>



<p><em>“SEC’s enforcement approach with respect to the digital asset industry now resembles carpet-bombing efforts rather than strategic or targeted actions intended to signal principled policy positions, as was more typical of the SEC under its prior leadership,”</em> they said.</p>



<p>According to the experts, while enforcement actions are essential in sanctioning fraudulent actors and protecting investors, their utility as a means of conveying prospective regulatory expectations is limited.&nbsp;Moreover, they argued that enforcement actions and litigation are inherently backwards-looking, often addressing factual scenarios and market trends that are no longer prevalent in the industry.</p>



<p>They highlighted the ongoing SEC vs Ripple case as an example of the limited utility of enforcement in conveying regulatory expectations. In their view, the facts alleged by the SEC in the case align with early ICO boom characteristics. At the same time, the current market practices around protocol and digital asset launches have evolved significantly. The legal experts thus argued that the outcome of the Ripple litigation would likely have limited implications for the blockchain and digital asset industry.</p>



<p><em>“The application of the laws implicated by protocol and digital asset launches-including the Securities Act of 1933 and its interpretation in&nbsp;Howey&nbsp;and its progeny-is always highly dependent on the facts and circumstances surrounding the offer and sale of the alleged security. Thus, while the outcome of the XRP litigation will undoubtedly be of significance for Ripple and XRP holders, the implications for modern launch plans and digital asset distribution models with materially different facts are likely to be limited,” </em>they added.</p>



<p>However, advising the SEC, the lawyers emphasized two primary tools for implementing mandates and regulating markets. The first is making rules and guidelines that look ahead and provide expectations for the future while the second tool is enforcement actions that apply existing rules and regulations through taking action against those who break the rules that already exist.</p>



<p>That said, with many viewing <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-attorney-is-ready-to-go-to-bat-for-binance-coinbase-users-in-fight-against-sec/">SEC&#8217;s enforcement actions</a> as disorderly and unclear in terms of policy signals, a court decision in the Ripple case could offer precise guidance regarding regulatory expectations for the digital asset industry.</p>

<ul>
<li>Bitcoin has plunged 4.1% in the past seven days trading at $25,644 way below the $27,000 resistance level. </li>



<li>Investors worry over the debt ceiling negotiations and regulatory uncertainty in the United States as BTC hit a 30-month low.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Total value locked across DeFi protocols sheds 3.65% in 24 hours as slow exit continues amid wider market concerns. </li>
</ul>



<p>The digital assets market has recorded bullish signals this year but the recent outlook suggests it may be heading towards the first bad month of 2023.</p>



<p>Digital assets continue their week-long poor form with Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (, ETH), and other top 10 assets falling below prominent positions. Market leader BTC hit a 30-day low yesterday at $25,511, dropping 5% across 24 hours.</p>



<p>While several pundits described BTC as being on the cusp of pushing through the $28,000 resistance on its rebound, the asset rather declined to 10-week lows. ETH which traded <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ether-hits-11-month-high-as-shapella-gains-add-up-despite-over-1-million-eth-withdrawals/">above</a> $2,100 post Shapella has hit a 7-day low at $1,740 making a short-term vote unlikely amid present market conditions.</p>



<p>Assets in the top 15 by market cap have all recorded weekly losses except Tron which gained 8.63%. The reason for these widespread losses ranges from fears about the United States debt ceiling, regulatory uncertainty and investors largely moving away from riskier assets. Some analysts have stated that these fears surrounding the market are overstated with some indicators showing positives.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-debt-ceiling-causing-panic">Debt ceiling causing panic&nbsp;</h2>



<p>This issue is two-way traffic. Several commentators believe that the US <a href="https://zycrypto.com/joe-biden-slams-wealthy-crypto-traders-what-you-need-to-know-on-the-presidents-anti-bitcoin-stance/">defaulting</a> on its debt for the first time could result in massive inflows to Bitcoin. No matter the reason posed, there will be liquidity problems straining investors creating another debacle for the market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>BTC and the S&amp;P 500 remain correlated with many banks predicting a sharp recession in the US this year. Investor sentiment remains low according to data compiled by the U.S. Bank.</p>



<p>“<em>Our U.S. Health Check is at levels consistent with historical recessions as the Federal Reserve continues tightening monetary policy to combat elevated inflation,” </em>the report stated. </p>

<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has gone after two of the world’s biggest crypto exchanges this week, filing suits against Binance and Coinbase and making grave allegations about both firms (y i k e s!).</p>



<p>In the wake of the back-to-back enforcement actions, XRP holder’s attorney John E. Deaton has announced he is prepared to also represent the customers of these two exchange giants by submitting an amicus curiae brief in a bid to safeguard their interests in the ongoing cases.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-deaton-considers-amicus-status-for-binance-and-coinbase-customers"><strong>Deaton Considers Amicus Status For Binance And Coinbase Customers</strong></h2>



<p>John E. Deaton, the lawyer representing over 75,000 XRP holders, feels the SEC is not working in the best interests of the users of Coinbase and Binance as it claims.</p>



<p>As such, he is calling on customers of these two exchanges to come together and see if they can have their voices heard by participating in the lawsuits as amicus or friends of the court.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1666987520809218048">series of tweets </a>recently, Deaton posited that he did not back Ripple as a firm, and he will also not be taking any position on whether Binance and Coinbase violated securities laws, as the SEC alleges. The CryptoLaw founder noted that the SEC determined that Coinbase’s initial public offering (IPO) was in the public interest before approving it over two years ago, and doing a complete U-turn now only proves that the securities watchdog is not acting in favour of the exchange’s customers.</p>



<p>Deaton said he expects the two digital asset exchanges to defend themselves, not the users. “As I said to the Judge in the Ripple case, I expect Ripple to look out for Ripple and not individual #XRPHolders. The same applies to Coinbase and Binance. But the SEC is NOT acting in the best interests of retail crypto holders and that is for sure. The SEC has an agenda,” he postulated.</p>



<p>While the lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance have not entered the court phase yet, there’s a high possibility that these cases won’t be decided or settled for many years — if the SEC’s three-year-old case against Ripple is any indication. Hence, Deaton is taking action by collecting the details of Coinbase and Binance&#8217;s users who want to be represented. The XRP lawyer assured that the customers who fill out their names and emails in the Google form he shared will remain anonymous unless the courts demand the information.</p>



<p>That being said, it&#8217;s believed that the judges assigned to the Coinbase and Binance lawsuits will be paying close attention to whether XRP is a security. This means the outcome of the Ripple suit could influence the cases against the two exchanges.</p>

<p>Prominent trading platform Robinhood is cutting support for three coins implicated in the SEC lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase. The firm will no longer support Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), and Solana (SOL) after June 27, 2023.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-robinhood-axes-sec-designated-crypto-securities"><strong>Robinhood Axes SEC-Designated Crypto Securities</strong></h2>



<p>Robinhood has announced to its millions of customers that it has decided to delist tokens that were identified as securities in recent legal proceedings initiated against crypto exchange giants Binance and Coinbase by the SEC.</p>



<p>“We regularly review the crypto we offer on Robinhood,&#8221; the company said in a<a href="https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/cardano-polygon-solana-update/"> blog post</a>. &#8220;Based on our latest review, we’ve decided to end support for Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), and Solana (SOL) on June 27th, 2023, at 6:59 PM ET.&#8221;</p>



<p>Holders should withdraw or transfer these tokens on the app before the deadline. Afterwards, the company will automatically sell the coins left in holders’ accounts at market value and credit the amount into the users&#8217; Robinhood buying power. Notably, this decision only affects SOL, MATIC, and ADA, and not other tokens supported by the platform.</p>



<p>The prices of the three coins remained largely unchanged following the delisting, with ADA plummeting 4.69%, SOL falling 1.22%, and MATIC dropping 1.68%.</p>



<p>The move by Robinhood comes days after the SEC sued both <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">Binance </a>and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-suffers-double-whammy-as-sec-and-state-regulators-act-against-exchange-for-unregistered-securities/">Coinbase </a>for a myriad of alleged securities laws violations. The SEC’s recent aggressive actions against crypto exchanges highlight the agency’s intent to police the industry through enforcement in the absence of a clear regulatory framework.</p>



<p>While testifying before the House Agriculture Committee on Tuesday, Robinhood Markets&#8217; chief compliance lawyer Dan Gallagher said the company was keenly reviewing the SEC’s complaints against the two exchanges. </p>



<p>The fintech trading app listed Solana and Polygon in April 2022, with Cardano’s addition coming in September 2022. Developers behind ADA, Input Output Global (IOG), have publicly <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-devs-vigorously-dispute-secs-classification-of-ada-as-a-security-as-robinhood-mulls-delisting-coin/">disputed </a>the SEC’s classification of the token as unregistered securities.</p>

<p>Australia-based attorney, Bill Morgan, has highlighted three upcoming events that are set to happen on the same day: June 13. Morgan thinks the said date will prove “monumental” for the crypto sector.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-important-events-to-watch-out-for-on-june-13"><strong>Important Events To Watch Out For On June 13</strong></h2>



<p>Pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan observed that Binance is expected to file its response to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-us-says-customer-funds-are-safe-as-sec-requests-restraining-order-to-freeze-assets/">injunction </a>for a temporary restraining order to freeze corporate assets, including cryptocurrencies, held by Binance.US.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The regulator and Binance.US are due back in court on June 13 regarding the matter — the same day the American entity of the global crypto exchange Binance says it will halt the use of fiat and transition to a crypto-only exchange.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, news broke that the SEC is <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-responds-to-secs-complaint-pledges-vigorous-defense-amid-overwhelming-industry-support/">suing </a>Binance, the CEO of the world’s largest crypto exchange, Changpeng Zhao (aka CZ), alleging the sale of unregistered securities, commingling of customer funds and that CZ was &#8220;secretly&#8221; controlling Binance.US. The SEC also launched a lawsuit <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-suffers-double-whammy-as-sec-and-state-regulators-act-against-exchange-for-unregistered-securities/">against rival U.S.-based exchange Coinbase</a> a day later.</p>



<p>And to boost its emergency motion seeking the freezing of Binance.US’s assets, the SEC also claimed that BAM Trading Services — the operator of Binance.US — and Binance deposited billions of dollars into one account that belonged to Merit Peak, of which Zhao is the beneficial owner.</p>



<p>Curiously, June 13 is also the day the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/groundbreaking-ripple-win-in-xrp-case-looking-likely-as-court-rejects-secs-request-to-keep-hinman-docs-hidden/">long-awaited Hinman emails</a> are set to be unsealed and the same day the House Financial Service Committee will discuss the future of digital assets. Many believe the committee hearing will mark another possible move toward a bipartisan negotiation on the law that could be the easiest way to take a first step toward U.S. regulation of cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was trading 0.78% higher at $26,727 at the time of writing.</p>



<p>Tuesday the 13<sup>th</sup> is likely the most important day of the week and could be trend-setting for the crypto market. It remains to be seen whether the monumental day turns out to be crypto’s best.</p>

<p>Even amid a regulatory upheaval, Cathie Wood of Ark Invest is sticking to one of the loftiest forecasts yet: that the price of Bitcoin will exceed $1 million by the end of the decade. The noted investor-cum-longtime bull for the crypto industry believes Bitcoin is a perfect hedge against inflation and counterparty risk. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-wood-still-expects-btc-to-close-decade-at-1m"><strong>Wood Still Expects BTC To Close Decade At $1M</strong></h2>



<p>Cathie Wood has once again doubled down on her $1 million Bitcoin price prediction.</p>



<p>Wood said in a Thursday <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII&amp;ab_channel=BloombergTelevision">interview </a>with <em>Bloomberg </em>that the “uncertainty and volatility” in the global economies have only increased her confidence in the flagship cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>For Wood, Bitcoin is an “antidote” to counterparty risks and a hedge against inflation. Because of this fundamental soundness, the investor says, bitcoin will hit $1 million by 2030. </p>



<p>In May 2021, Wood made her first bold price prediction during an interview on <em>Bloomberg</em>, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/amid-crypto-market-armageddon-ark-invests-cathie-wood-still-thinks-bitcoin-can-go-to-500000/">forecasting Bitcoin would go to $500,000 by 2026</a>. In early 2022, she upped the ante to $1 million by 2030.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Wood Says Coinbase Will Come Out Winner In SEC Suit</strong></h2>



<p>Wood has also been quite bullish on Coinbase in recent months. Speaking about the legal showdown at Binance and Coinbase amid SEC’s ongoing onslaught against the crypto industry, the Ark Invest CEO and CIO said that the two heavyweight crypto exchanges are “not at all in the same bucket”. </p>



<p>The SEC filed two major suits and an application for a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-us-says-customer-funds-are-safe-as-sec-requests-restraining-order-to-freeze-assets/">temporary restraining order</a> over two days against Binance and Coinbase, respectively the world’s and America’s biggest crypto exchanges. Despite the suits against the firms coming in quick succession, Wood emphasized that the Binance complaint was far more serious. She posited that “we have the competition for Coinbase disappearing, so that’s a good thing longer term for Coinbase.”</p>



<p>Wood further observed that it was “unfortunate” the SEC sued Coinbase the day after taking action against Binance and that SEC chair Gary Gensler was just “trying to implicate Coinbase in the same way he was implicating Binance.”  </p>



<p>Wood’s Ark Invest has scooped up huge amounts of Coinbase stock. On Tuesday, ARK purchased 419,324 shares of Coinbase worth about $22 million shortly after the SEC announced its complaint against the only publicly traded crypto exchange.</p>

<ul>
<li>Solana and XRP soared by 4% and 11%, respectively, in the last seven days performing above other top coins.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The uptick comes as XRP daily addresses surge near its record high and news of&nbsp; Ripple contemplating going public makes the rounds.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Solana’s NFTs lose ground to BRC tokens, but its outlook is bullish despite the NFT downturn.</li>
</ul>



<p>The digital asset market has regained lost ground recovering from four-week lows with slight gains recorded in Bitcoin (BTC) amid thriving altcoins.</p>



<p>XRP was the biggest gainer in the crypto market this past week, surging 11% following positive reports from its case with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and growth in its number of active users. XRP recorded a spike in network activity as the number of unique addresses increased to 490,000.</p>



<p>XRP also recorded a 45% Daily Active Address (DAA) spike in March, setting the tone for bullish traders expecting a similar rally following the recent data. Furthermore, talks of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-contemplates-ipo-as-sec-lawsuit-finally-nears-end-will-it-propel-xrp-to-10/?amp">Ripple going public</a> after its case with the SEC also sprung up around crypto circles last week, with bulls setting eyes on $10.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Solana (SOL) showed strong signs at the start of the year before slowing down last month. SOL is up 4% in the past seven days as traders believe it can break past $24. Hovering below $20, SOL will need a 12% boost to overcome that resistance. The 24-hour trading volume for SOL stands at $303 million, a 59% gain from its previous averages, signifying growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Market leader Bitcoin recorded slight gains amid soaring altcoin and eventually retested $28,000 before plunging below $27,000. The leading altcoin, Ethereum (ETH), moved past $1,900 within the week but currently exchanges hands at $1,844.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-solana-s-nft-tanks-again"><strong>Solana’s NFT tanks…. again</strong></h2>



<p>Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have been at the top of Solana’s growth attracting countless users and investors to the project. Previously, NFT activities on the platform have displaced&nbsp;Ethereum, with several pundits tipping Solana’s NFTs over top Ethereum releases.</p>



<p>The good days may be over for Solana as present figures remain a shadow of their former glory. In May, NFT sales plunged by nearly 50% to $44 million, and its overall activity declined by 12%. The slow growth in Solana marked a sharp spike in Bitcoin Ordinals.</p>



<p>The Bitcoin-based NFTs soared 475% in the last 30 days, with over 10 million <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ordinals-attract-ethereum-devs-to-bitcoin-as-projects-mass-adoption-skyrockets/">inscriptions</a> since its launch. Ordinal sales volume stands at $194 million in May from $32 million in April. While controversy surrounds Ordinals, it has displaced the community dubbed “<em>kings of NFTs.”&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>ARK Invest, Cathie Wood&#8217;s investment firm, acquired additional shares of the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, valued at over $21 million, despite ongoing accusations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>



<p>ARK Invest&#8217;s decision comes one day after the SEC <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-suffers-double-whammy-as-sec-and-state-regulators-act-against-exchange-for-unregistered-securities/">sued</a> Coinbase, accusing it of operating as a national securities exchange and an unregistered broker.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ark-invest-buys-21m-of-coinbase-shares-amidst-sec-accusations"><strong>ARK Invest buys $21M of Coinbase shares amidst SEC accusations</strong></h2>



<p>Cathie Wood and her investment firm demonstrated their confidence in Coinbase through a multimillion-dollar purchase, expecting long-term profits. Despite the SEC lawsuit, Coinbase remains the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States.</p>



<p>While many investors panicked over the SEC lawsuit, several ARK Invest ETFs took advantage of the stock price drop to make substantial purchases. The Ark Innovation ETF acquired 329,773 shares, the Next Generation Internet ETF acquired 53,885 shares, and the Ark Fintech Innovation ETF acquired 35,666 shares.</p>



<p>With the recent purchase of over 419,000 Coinbase shares, Ark Invest now holds a total of more than 11.4 million shares, valued at approximately $609 million based on the press time price of $51.6.</p>



<p>Although the decision to buy Coinbase shares at this time may seem risky, given the current regulatory environment and bearish market, Wood has shown that she has rarely been wrong in her investments, becoming one of Wall Street&#8217;s most respected gurus.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Coinbase demands clarity from SEC on crypto asset regulation</strong></h2>



<p>This is not the first time Coinbase has been <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-v-sec-chamber-of-digital-commerce-weighs-in-argues-regulator-is-causing-substantial-economic-harm/">targeted by the SEC</a>. In 2022, regulators issued an enforcement action notice to the exchange, citing alleged securities law violations.</p>



<p>However, Coinbase immediately responded to the SEC&#8217;s accusations, stating that they lacked arguments and demanding greater clarity from a U.S. court on how the exchange should apply securities laws to digital assets. The court ordered the SEC to respond to the complaint within 30 days, but they have not complied with the orders thus far.</p>



<p>On May 7th, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals requested the SEC to respond within seven days to Coinbase&#8217;s complaints and clarify their rules on which assets should be considered securities and how they should be regulated.</p>



<p>Paul Grewal, Coinbase&#8217;s Chief Legal Officer, commented on Twitter that the Court of Appeals learned about the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit on the same day as the exchange, stating that regulators should not be proceeding with litigation against the crypto industry.</p>



<p>Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, recently <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-risks-losing-global-technology-leadership-role-to-china-due-to-restrictive-crypto-policies-coinbase-ceo/">indicated</a> that if the SEC continues to attack crypto companies without providing clear regulation, it will drive them away from the country, as happened with some exchanges like Bittrex.</p>

<p>A long-dormant Bitcoin whale has resurfaced after 10 years, amassing an astounding profit of around $38 million.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The transaction was reported by on-chain analysis firm LookIntoChain on Twitter, providing a glimpse into the intriguing world of cryptocurrency whales. As per the Thursday tweet, the dormant whale, who had remained inactive for over a decade, <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/1E6nViR5Xv1wyNXg87SamvtLJ5TyXuksLC">initiated</a> a transfer of 1,432.93 BTC, equivalent to $37.8 million, to a new address labelled &#8220;bc1psv.&#8221;</p>



<p>The impressive nature of this transaction lies not only in the substantial profit but also in the lengthy period of inactivity. According to the tweet, the whale received these 1,432.92 BTC on April 9, 2013, when the price of Bitcoin was a mere $195.4.</p>



<p>This event adds to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-whales-someone-just-moved-257-worth-of-bitcoin-from-a-dormant-address/">similar instances</a> where long-dormant whales resurface and make substantial moves within the cryptocurrency market. In April, another dormant whale transferred 400 BTC, valued at nearly $11 million, after a sleep of nearly 12 years. In February of this year, an old Bitcoin address that had remained untouched for 11 years initiated a transaction, moving $9.6 million worth of the cryptocurrency. Mid last month, another whale holding 311 bitcoins since June 2011 woke up, transferring the coins to a new Segwit address</p>



<p>The emergence of these whales after extended periods of dormancy raises questions about their motivations and overall strategy. While some experts believe these movements signify profit-taking or strategic portfolio reallocations, others suggest that these whales may seek to drive the market, capitalizing on opportunities to acquire undervalued coins.</p>



<p>Regardless of their intentions, these events emphasize the significance of long-term investment strategies in cryptocurrency, with substantial profits often realized by those who patiently hold their assets.</p>



<p>Notably, cryptocurrency whales, particularly those who have held Bitcoin for extended periods, have been among the most successful investors in the market. Bitcoin&#8217;s remarkable growth of over 29,000,000 percent in the past 10 years is a testament to the potential returns garnered by those who have demonstrated a long-term investment approach. Moreover, research indicates that inexperienced retail investors who engage in short-term trading tend to fare less favourably than those who adopt a patient, long-term perspective.</p>



<p>That said, as the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, it is anticipated that similar instances of dormant whale awakening will continue to emerge, shaping the history of Bitcoin and fueling curiosity and interest in crypto.</p>

<p>Cardano blockchain builder Input Output Global (IOG) has rejected the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) claims that ADA is a security. The SEC had argued in lawsuits levied against two of the world’s biggest crypto brands this week that Cardano’s native token ADA and several other coins qualify as securities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-under-no-circumstances-is-ada-a-security-iog"><strong>“Under No Circumstances Is ADA A Security”: IOG</strong></h2>



<p>Input Output Global has responded to SEC’s recent claim that ADA is an unregistered security.</p>



<p>In a June 7 <a href="https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2023/06/07/iog-response-to-the-recent-sec-filings/">statement</a>, the Cardano developers refuted the SEC’s assertion, positing that “under no circumstances is ADA a security under U.S. securities laws. It never has been.”</p>



<p>IOG pointed out the lack of understanding of decentralized blockchains and stressed the importance of formulating responsible legislation in collaboration with regulators. The statement further notes that the regulation-by-enforcement approach employed by the SEC does not provide the clarity that the cryptocurrency industry is entitled to. IOG advocates for regulation that recognizes blockchain’s unique traits and the key role it can play in the modern world.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>SEC Lawsuits And Possible Robinhood Delisting&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The SEC <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-suffers-double-whammy-as-sec-and-state-regulators-act-against-exchange-for-unregistered-securities/">sued </a>Coinbase on Tuesday, just one day after the securities watchdog sued Binance for unregistered securities offerings. A core pillar of the SEC’s charges against Binance and BAM Trading — the operator of Binance.US — is that the two commingled customers’ funds. In fact, the SEC has filed a new court document alleging that Binance and Binance.US redirected more than $12 billion worth of customer assets to firms controlled by Binance CEO Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao between 2019 and 2021.</p>



<p>The SEC claims America’s largest digital asset exchange Coinbase operated for years as an unlicensed securities exchange and “elevated its interest in increasing its profits over investors’ interests.”</p>



<p>In these two lawsuits, the SEC publicly declared which cryptocurrencies are in its sights. The regulator considers the following to be securities: Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), Filecoin (FIL) and Sandbox (SAND), among several others. If these tokens were to be officially categorized as securities under federal laws, this could have profound ramifications for investors and crypto exchanges, likely altering the outlook of the crypto industry in the U.S.</p>



<p>Amid these growing regulatory concerns, online trading brokerage Robinhood has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-06/robinhood-reviews-crypto-offerings-after-regulatory-crackdown">revealed </a>it may soon cease offering trading services for several cryptocurrencies implicated in the SEC lawsuit, including ADA, to comply with U.S. securities laws. The potential removal of ADA from Robinhood’s trading platform comes less than a year after the company announced support for the peer-reviewed Proof of Stake (PoS) cryptocurrency. Robinhood <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-trading-for-over-20-million-robinhood-users-is-a-mind-blowing-ada-moonshot-incoming/">listed </a>ADA in September 2022 as part of a broader expansion of the company’s cryptocurrency offerings that year.</p>

<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s recent price movements have presented a mix of positive indications and challenges, resulting in a cautious sense of optimism among investors regarding its future.</p>



<p>Throughout the previous week, Bitcoin had comfortably sustained a position above $27,000. However, the allegations against Binance and Coinbase have reignited concerns about the industry&#8217;s integrity and raised questions about regulators&#8217; intentions to tighten their control over the crypto sector.</p>



<p>The top cryptocurrency experienced a flash crash on Monday, plummeting to around $25,500 in response to the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">lawsuit</a> against Binance for allegedly violating securities laws. However, Bitcoin showcased its resilience by swiftly rebounding, and on Tuesday, it surged to a price of $27,390, with traders seemingly disregarding SEC’s move.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="647" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-11-1024x647.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81905" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-11-1024x647.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-11-300x190.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-11-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-11-1536x971.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-11-2048x1294.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTCUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Earlier today, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode shed light on the market&#8217;s reaction to the mounting regulatory pressures. Notably, despite significant volatility triggered by the intensifying regulatory scrutiny from US authorities, Glassnode revealed that the recorded realized losses on-chain remained relatively low at $112 million.</p>



<p>“<em>This remains -$3.05B (-96.5%) smaller than the largest recorded capitulation event, suggesting an increased degree of resilience amongst market participants,” </em>tweeted the firm.</p>



<p>Cryptohell, an analyst from Cryptoquant, highlighted impressive long-term holder reactions amidst the negative news surrounding Binance. In a tweet, the analyst examined two indicators, Exchange Inflow &#8211; Spent Output Age Bands and Exchange Inflow &#8211; Spent Output Value Bands, to identify the investors responsible for the short-term correction in Bitcoin&#8217;s price.</p>



<p>As per his analysis, long-term holders with a holding period of over one year did not engage in significant sell-offs. Instead, holders with 3-6 months holding periods, day traders, and weekly swing traders were identified as the current sellers.</p>



<p>The pundit concluded that long-term holders continue to retain their Bitcoin supply, leading to speculation that they may be preparing for the anticipated halving event in 2024.</p>



<p>That said, despite Tuesday’s resurgence, Bitcoin&#8217;s woes seem to have worsened, with the SEC reportedly asking a court to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-us-says-customer-funds-are-safe-as-sec-requests-restraining-order-to-freeze-assets/">freeze the assets of Binance US</a> temporarily. This led to Bitcoin witnessing a further drop Wednesday, with crypto analyst “Material Indicators” tweeting, <em>&#8220;Yesterday went as predicted. Today, FUD continues to stimulate PA across the market.”</em></p>



<p>The pundit then shared his analysis, stating that Bitcoin is currently retesting the 200-Week Moving Average (MA). However, bid liquidity appears to be relatively low at this level. According to him, should the 200-Week MA fail to hold, he predicted another retest of the 50-Month MA, where both liquidity and sentiment exhibit greater strength.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="556" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-10-1024x556.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81904" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-10-1024x556.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-10-300x163.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-10-768x417.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-10-1536x833.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-10.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Notably, Bitcoin has already formed a double bottom pattern at the 50-Month MA, which is visible in the hourly timeframes. If a triple bottom were to emerge, it would signal a bullish trend, according to Material Indicators.</p>



<p>However, the expert cautioned that a sudden price drop to $25,000 could potentially clear the path towards a bearish market sentiment, urging traders to “plan for the possibilities.&#8221;</p>



<p>At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $26,384, down 0.27% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. </p>
