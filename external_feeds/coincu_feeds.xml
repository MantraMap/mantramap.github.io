Source: Opensea</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>This boom is largely attributed to financial services giant BlackRock&#8217;s filing for a spot Bitcoin ETF with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on June 15.</p>



<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has rejected any application to establish a spot Bitcoin ETF. However, in the case of Blackrock, this time, the SEC approval rate for a Bitcoin ETF application is relatively high because of its careful preparation. Blackrock&#8217;s ETF application could serve as a key event in crypto 2023 and possibly beyond.</p>



<p>This event not only helps to keep the &#8220;rock&#8221; themes trending on NFT collections, but it also provides a great deal of optimism for companies that also offer wealth management services in the traditionally dynamic market to enter the promising Bitcoin market.</p>



<p>In less than a week, a series of large funds such as Fidelity, Citadel, Charles Schwab, Deutsche Bank, MasterCard, WisdomTree,… have all applied to open a spot Bitcoin ETF with the SEC and have caused <a href="https://news.coincu.com/196664-bitcoin-29000-spot-bitcoin-etf-application/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BTC price</a> to increase continuously since $26,000 to $30,200 in just 2 days, BTC price is up more than 20% this week.</p>

<p>On May 16, the company applied for a BTC futures ETF called the Valkyrie Bitcoin Futures Leveraged Strategic ETF (BTFD). The BTFD will be a fund rather than a trust, as with the company&#8217;s proposed BTC spot ETF.</p>



<p>Unlike the Bitcoin futures ETF, which is based on a contract executed at the future price of BTC, the Bitcoin spot ETF will be based on the current Bitcoin price and thereby reflect the current market capitalization of BTC.</p>



<p>BlackRock applied to list a BTC spot ETF on Nasdaq as a trust on June 15. WisdomTree and Invesco filed a similar application on June 20. There are also unconfirmed reports that Fidelity will file. BTC spot ETF application.</p>



<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has rejected any application to establish a spot Bitcoin ETF. However, in the case of Blackrock, this time, the SEC approval rate for a Bitcoin ETF application is relatively high because of its careful preparation.</p>



<p>The race to get a spot Bitcoin ETF license created such a strong cheer that the Bitcoin price <a href="https://news.coincu.com/196664-bitcoin-29000-spot-bitcoin-etf-application/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">skyrocketed</a> from $26,000 to $30,500 in less than a week. Currently, bitcoin is recording at $30,200, up 6.77% over the past 24 hours.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Circle announced that repurchase agreements for US Treasuries would continue to be part of the reserve fund.</em></li>



<li><em>BlackRock is the major asset manager of the stablecoin issuer.</em></li>



<li><em>Since last month, Circle has adjusted the USDC reserve asset structure to protect the stablecoin from a potential US default.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Circle Internet Financial, a stablecoin issuer, has begun buying US Treasury bonds as part of its USDC reserve assets. During last month&#8217;s US debt ceiling strike, the company sold all US Treasury bonds.</strong></h5>



<p>CFO Jeremy Fox-Geen said on a conference call Wednesday that the Circle Reserve Fund (USDXX), managed by asset management giant BlackRock, has begun &#8220;directly holding US Treasury bonds&#8221;. Fox-Geen added that the fund would also keep repurchase agreements (repos) as part of its USDC reserves.</p>

<p>Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire <a href="https://news.coincu.com/186653-circle-usdc-reserve-avoid-us-default-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> in a statement to Politico on May 10 that his stablecoin company no longer holds long-term US Treasury bonds. Specifically, the company will not hold Treasuries maturing after June 2023. Allaire explained the company&#8217;s reasoning by stating that it did not want to be exposed to the possibility of a US government default.</p>



<p>Since June, the reserve has moved all assets into a tripartite repo involving critical banks in the system, including Goldman Sachs, BNP Paribas, Bank of America, and Royal Bank of Canada.</p>

<p>Tether&#8217;s USDT and Circle&#8217;s USDC are the two largest stablecoins in circulation. In it, Circle backs its USDC stablecoin with various assets, including cash, cash equivalents, and Treasuries. According to data from January, about 65% of USDC reserves are made up of Treasury bills, meaning a significant amount of its reserves could be affected by default.</p>



<p>According to BlackRock&#8217;s website, Circle has added $2.2 billion in US Treasuries to the fund since June 20, while repurchase agreements account for about 90% of the fund&#8217;s reserve assets. Fox-Geen said the company also has $3.5 billion in bank deposits, of which &#8220;mostly, more than 90%&#8221; is deposited in BNY Mellon.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>MakerDAO has just completed the purchase of an additional $700 million in US Treasury bonds.</em></li>



<li><em>After buying $500 million of bonds in October 2022, the total current holding of the project is up to $1.2 billion.</em></li>



<li><em>The DAO investing in bonds is a way to gain exposure to many low-risk financial instruments.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The issuer of stablecoins and decentralized finance protocol MakerDAO purchased another $700 million in US Treasury bonds, bringing the platform&#8217;s DAI stablecoin reserve to $1.2 billion, according to a press statement.</strong></h5>

<p>The acquisition was the next stage in Maker&#8217;s approach, defined by creator Rune Christensen&#8217;s &#8220;Endgame Plan,&#8221; to diversify the assets underpinning the $4.5 billion dollar-pegged stablecoin by boosting the role of conventional financial assets in reserve, such as government bonds.</p>



<p>With the acquisition of a $500 million bond in October 2022, the organization&#8217;s total bond holdings currently stand at $1.2 billion. MakerDAO purchased the bonds to expand its exposure to low-risk, liquid conventional assets.</p>

<p>According to a statement, the acquisition was executed on behalf of MakerDAO by the digital asset management Monetalis Clydesdale Vault, which was formed from the DeFi lender Monetalis Group. Monetalis Group CEO Allan Pedersen stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;MakerDAO is a pioneer and leader in the DeFi space and has built up a large volume of funds in its peg-stability-module, which ensures the stability of the DAI stablecoin.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The platform is being restructured, which involves dividing its structure into smaller, autonomous parts known as SubDAOs and investing in yield-generating, real-world assets to improve protocol income at a time when demand for crypto financing is low.</p>



<p>MKR, following the news, spiked more than 5% at $770 but quickly fell back to the $747 price zone.</p>

<p>In March, MakerDAO increased its debt limit from $500 million to $1.25 billion. Moreover, MakerDAO suggested raising the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) to 3.33% on May 26, which, if approved, may increase the stablecoin&#8217;s market capitalization by boosting demand for DAI holdings.</p>



<p>MakerDAO voting members also supported withdrawing $500 million in Paxos Dollar (USDP) and $390 million in Gemini Dollar (GUSD) from the reserve to pursue higher-yielding assets.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Fed Chairman Jerome Powell expressed a position that inflation is well above the Fed&#8217;s long-term target of 2%.</em></li>



<li><em>According to Powell, the Fed has raised its policy rate by about 5% since the beginning of last year, and it will take time to have a full effect on inflation.</em></li>



<li><em>Bitcoin posted significant intraday gains following the above news.</em></li>

<p>In a semiannual monetary policy report issued before the report to the House Financial Services Committee, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year. Nonetheless, inflation pressures continue to run high, and the process of getting inflation back down to 2% has a long way to go.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Powell&#8217;s hearings before the House and Senate came just days after the US central bank&#8217;s rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) chose to keep interest rates constant after a year of 10 straight rises. Since March 2022, the Fed has hiked rates ten times, but inflation remains considerably over the central bank&#8217;s 2% objective.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Nearly all FOMC participants expect that it will be appropriate to raise interest rates somewhat further by the end of the year,&#8221; he said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Coupled with his remarks on monetary policy, Powell said that policymakers are aware of the need for careful budgetary and regulatory controls over a banking sector that faced instability earlier this year.</p>

<p>Powell, on the other hand, promised legislators on Wednesday that the Fed&#8217;s policy measures would adapt as inflation decreases. Moreover, although the Fed has increased its policy rate by nearly 5% since the beginning of last year, the entire impact on inflation will take time.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Now we’re moderating that pace, much as you might do if you were to be driving 75 miles an hour on a highway, then 50 miles an hour on a local highway, then as you get closer to your destination, you try to find that destination you slow down even further,” he said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>His planned appearance before Congress to discuss the Fed&#8217;s semiannual report on monetary policy provides legislators with an opportunity to question the bank&#8217;s most senior official at a time when interest rates are high and economic growth is faltering.</p>



<p>According to the Fed Chairman, the country&#8217;s economy is encountering headwinds as consumer and business credit borrowing conditions tighten. According to some, this circumstance may have an impact on economic activity, employment, and inflation.</p>



<p>Once the Federal Reserve chose to suspend interest rate rises, stock and cryptocurrency investors became hungry. Bitcoin has surpassed $30,000 for the first time since April, boosted by crypto projects involving large players in the conventional banking industry.</p>

<p>The biggest digital asset surged by more than 8% in a single day. Smaller currencies like Ether, Cardano, and Solana saw increases as well.</p>



<p>Crypto investors have found solace in the launch of EDX Markets, a digital asset exchange supported by Citadel Securities, Fidelity Digital Assets, and Charles Schwab Inc. Separately, BlackRock Inc. and WisdomTree Inc. have both filed for spot US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Binance coin price in the weekly chart</strong></h2>



<p>Last week&#8217;s candle successfully tested the $210-$220 support zone, but the selling pressure was not strong enough to break through this support area. However, buying power at this level was not strong enough to return to the $270 level (the previous week&#8217;s average price).</p>



<p>This week’s candle has already retested the price level at $238, which is last week&#8217;s average price. From a technical analysis perspective, the price will move towards retesting the $270 level, checking the demand-supply once again at this level.</p>

<p>The weekly candle shows that it is in a downtrend as there is a Marubozu candle bearish, breaking the uptrend line and pushing the price down to the intersection of EMA 21 and 50. The trend here is downward! However, from the demand-supply perspective, there will be some weekly candle rebound to retest the $270 price level!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Binance coin price in the daily chart</strong></h2>



<p>At the time of writing, the daily candle has a very strong selling pressure, with a substantial price reaction near EMA 50 (at the $254 price level). The daily candle is still following the primary trend of the weekly candle (downtrend) but is still in the process of pumping up to retest the $270 price level.</p>



<p>This indicates a potential reversal shortly, although it remains to be seen whether the buying power at the $270 level will be strong enough to sustain an upward trend. Traders and investors should closely monitor the price movement and take appropriate actions based on their risk tolerance and investment goals.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Binance coin price in the H4 chart</strong></h2>



<p>The H4 chart shows that Binance coin is likely to experience a bullish trend in the short term. The breaking of the wedge pattern and the retesting of the upper edge of the wedge by a few H4 candles are positive signs for the Binance coin price. Moreover, the H4 candle is entirely above the intersection of EMA 21 and 50, indicating a bullish trend.</p>



<p>In addition, the Ichimoku cloud has turned green, another positive sign for the recovery of the Binance coin price at the $270 level. The Ichimoku cloud is a popular technical indicator that provides support and resistance levels, trend direction, and momentum. When the cloud turns green, it indicates that the trend has turned bullish.</p>

</figure>



<p>Therefore, based on the technical analysis of the H4 chart, it is likely that Binance coin will experience a bullish trend in the short term. However, it is important to keep in mind that technical analysis is not always correct and that other factors, such as market sentiment and news events, can also influence the price of the coin. Therefore, it is essential to keep a close eye on the market and adjust your trading strategy accordingly.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In summary </strong></h2>



<p>Although the daily candle is currently showing a significant amount of selling pressure, technical analysis suggests that the price of Binance coin will move towards retesting the $270 level, with some weekly candle rebound to support this level. Furthermore, the upward trend on the H4 timeframe and the Ichimoku cloud turning green provide additional support for <a href="https://news.coincu.com/194572-will-binance-coin-be-able-to-withstand-fud/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/194572-will-binance-coin-be-able-to-withstand-fud/">recovering the Binance coin</a> price at this level.</p>

<p>At a June 21 hearing, Powell was asked by Congressman Maxine Waters if stablecoin issuers should be registered and regulated by the Federal Reserve. The Fed Chair said that payment stablecoins are a &#8220;form of money&#8221; and that central banks should regulate them.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We do see payment stablecoins as a form of money, and in all advanced economies, the ultimate source of credibility in money is the central bank. We believe that it would be appropriate to have a quite robust federal role in what happens in stablecoins going forward, and leaving us with a weak role and allowing a lot of private money creation at the state level would be a mistake,&#8221; said Powell.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Powell also said that the Fed&#8217;s staff has been participating in discussions with legislators from both parties about the crypto legislation that committee members have been working on. He seemed suspicious about state permission and preemption for stablecoin issuers, which are presently part of a Republican-led plan due for committee consideration.</p>

<p>Maxine Waters also criticized her Republican colleagues&#8217; idea to enable state authorities to authorize stablecoin issuance.</p>



<p>According to Waters, the plan takes state preemption to an unprecedented degree. She emphasized that a stablecoin approved in one jurisdiction may be sold in another, regardless of whether other state authorities have approved it.</p>



<p>While Republicans may get the measure through committee and the House of Representatives on a party-line vote, it needs Democratic backing to become law. Democrats control the Senate, and President Joe Biden would be reluctant to approve legislation that his own party opposes.</p>

<p>Powell did not go into specifics on the Fed&#8217;s stance on regulating stablecoins, but his final remark suggests that the central bank does not support private enterprises that issue stablecoins. In the next months, Lawmakers may seek new federal laws to put stablecoins under the supervision of the central bank.</p>

<p>As of the time of writing, the king of crypto is trading around $29,800, indicating a notable price rally in recent days. This surge follows a similar achievement in April, and the cryptocurrency has witnessed gains of nearly 22% over the past 30 days. These impressive developments in Bitcoin&#8217;s value coincide with significant moves in the traditional finance sector, as several industry giants have sought to establish Bitcoin-related investment offerings.</p>



<p>Prominent players in the traditional finance industry, including BlackRock, Invesco, and WisdomTree, have recently filed applications for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This move reflects a growing institutional interest in the cryptocurrency space and demonstrates a recognition of Bitcoin&#8217;s potential as a legitimate investment asset. </p>



<p>Additionally, the launch of the EDX crypto exchange further supports this trend. Backed by major traditional finance entities such as Fidelity Digital Assets, Charles Schwab, and Citadel Securities, EDX offers a range of tokens including Bitcoin, Ether, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin.</p>

Bitcoin Cash (BHC) has experienced a significant surge of 25% following the news of these institutional moves. This underscores the interconnected nature of the cryptocurrency market and the potential spillover effects between different digital assets.</p>

<p>The purchase of these assets will guarantee that CleanSpark has more than enough infrastructure to fulfill its goal of 16 EH/s of electricity by the end of 2023, according to Bradford.</p>



<p>Their recent major acquisition was 45,000 new Bitmain Antminer S19 XPs for $144.9 million in April.</p>



<p>CleanSpark mines Bitcoin utilizing low-carbon energy sources that represent for more than 90% of its energy mix, and it maintains a balanced capital management approach by selling a part of its generated bitcoins to reinvest in growth. The company exceeded its year-end forecast in 2022, doubling its hashrate and earning one of the greatest hashrate realization rates among its peers during the bad crypto market, thanks to this approach and the Company&#8217;s patented mining algorithm.</p>



<p>Bitcoin is currently approaching the $30,000 level, bringing excitement to investors. However, the upcoming halving that leads to a reduction in the blockchain reward while the operating costs remain the same is a challenge for Bitcoin miners.</p>
