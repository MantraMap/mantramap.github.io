Coinbase noted that creating the Advisory Council is a step in the right direction for the company. It would help the exchange to maintain a flawless operation process while rebuilding its strategies in the US and globally.  Coinbase is currently in a legal face-off with the SEC. So, engaging a new council is part of its preparatory strategies. Coinbase Prepares To Fight With The SEC Notably, the US SEC has toughened its regulatory stance in the crypto industry and is now closely watching most crypto-related firms. In one of its enforcement actions, the SEC issued a Wells Notice to Coinbase in March, warning the company of a possible lawsuit over alleged breaches of securities.  Reacting to the notice, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong noted that the regulator is focusing its accusations on staking and asset listing. He recalled that the SEC had reviewed the exchange’s operations and approved its license in the past. Armstrong stated that they requested a reasonable explanation from the SEC. According to the CEO, the firm intended to use the reply for rulemaking to maintain the right regulatory requirements for crypto assets. However, the SEC gave no response to the exchange&#8217;s request. Further, Paul Grewal, the Chief Legal Officer of Coinbase, expressed disappointment over the SEC’s preference for lawsuits to constructive dialoguing.  He noted that despite all their efforts to work with the SEC, the regulator gave them no feedback. Grewal stated that Coinbase would defend the rule of law if the SEC initiated a legal battle. -Featured image: Pexels, Chart: TradingView
