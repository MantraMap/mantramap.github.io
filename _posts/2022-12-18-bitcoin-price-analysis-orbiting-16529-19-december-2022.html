<p>BTC/USD Orbits 16529:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 19 December 2022</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) remained on the defensive early in the Asian session as the pair remained vulnerable around the 17000 figure after trading as low as the 16529.53 level, an area that represented a test of the 61.8% retracement of the appreciating range from 15460 to 18385.36. &nbsp;Technical demand emerged around the 16650.14 level during the pullback, a test of the 50% retracement of the recent appreciating range from 16529.53 to 16775.52.&nbsp;&nbsp; Stops were recently elected below the 16849.58 area during the ongoing depreciation, a downside price objective related to selling pressure that intensified below the 17525 area.&nbsp; Strong selling pressure around the 18385 and 17525 areas could result in tests of additional downside price objectives around the 16375, 15900, 15313, and 14364 levels.&nbsp; If BTC/USD is able to reclaim some upside momentum, additional technically significant upside retracement levels include the 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, the 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Below these areas, technically significant levels include the 14613, 14500.15, 13369, 10432.73, 10727, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 200-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and below the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
