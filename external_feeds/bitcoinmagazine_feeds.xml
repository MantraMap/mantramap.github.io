The organization sets out on a mission to spearhead policies that foster responsible energy practices, enhance grid resilience, maintain the competitive edge of the United States, and ensure national security.</p><p>“Policymaking efforts regarding digital assets have centered around financial services,”&nbsp;said&nbsp;Founder and President of the Digital Energy Council, Tom Mapes.&nbsp;“The focus on how both the digital asset mining and energy industries can collaborate and work together to bolster energy infrastructure, increase resilience, and support energy sustainability and efficiency has been lost in policy conversations, yet is critical during this pivotal moment of energy modernization.”</p><p>The DEC envisions itself as a hub for facilitating productive discourse among its members, policymakers, and regulators. A significant facet of the DEC's agenda is to dispel misconceptions around the bipartisan themes of digital asset mining, U.S. energy security, sustainability, and grid modernization.&nbsp;In addition to these goals, the council's efforts aim to cultivate economic development in often overlooked communities, including rural areas, by forging high-paying employment opportunities in non-traditional markets.</p><p>Pioneering efforts to engage policymakers have already been initiated, with notable figures like U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski,&nbsp;who spearheaded the inaugural hearing on digital asset mining's implications for energy supply in 2018,&nbsp;being among the first to collaborate.&nbsp;</p><p>“In 2018 as the Chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources, I held the first hearing to explore digital asset mining and the applications and potential impacts on our nation’s energy supply,” said Senator Murkowski. “In the past five years this industry has grown exponentially throughout the United States, and I have seen this technology already bring new opportunities to rural states like Alaska. I look forward to working with the Digital Energy Council to develop best practices for collaboration throughout Alaska and the United States.”</p><p>US Senator from Wyoming, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/senator-lummis">Cynthia Lummis</a>, also commented on the news, stating: “Financial innovation will unleash new prosperity and opportunity for the next generation of Americans, and crypto asset mining is an important part of this future. Innovative mining technologies will allow us to harness underutilized energy sources and drive jobs in rural America, while generating provably scarce wealth. All Americans should be paying attention to the important work being done by crypto asset miners.”</p><p>The Digital Energy Council aims to bring together thought leaders and industry pioneers to champion a future where responsible energy practices and digital asset mining synergize for the greater benefit of the nation's growth, security, and prosperity.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjAwMTAzNzc0MDA4NjQ5MDgw/dec-1.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Blockstream Launches ‘BASIC Note’ To Capitalize On Anticipated ASIC Market Recovery]]></title><description><![CDATA[Blockstream teams up with STOKR to create an investment offering via the Liquid network that aims to purchase low-priced ASICs to resell during the bull market.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/blockstream-banks-on-asic-market-recovery-with-basic-note</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/blockstream-banks-on-asic-market-recovery-with-basic-note</guid><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin Miners]]></category><category><![CDATA[Asics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Liquid]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Blockstream]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Craig Deutsch]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 15 Aug 2023 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTc5Mjk3ODEwMjM0NjE1NDQ3/blockstream-releases-first-enterprise-grade-product-on-liquid.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Blockstream, a top-tier Bitcoin infrastructure firm, has joined forces with STOKR, a trailblazing digital platform for alternative assets based in Luxembourg. Their collaboration has birthed a new investment offering: The Blockstream ASIC (BASIC) Note.</p><p>During the latest bitcoin bull market, prices for bitcoin mining machines, otherwise known as ASICs, witnessed a significant surge. This was followed by a major crash, bottoming in December 2022. The value of ASICs tend to have a pattern: They seem to be undervalued during bear markets, while enjoying outperformance during bull runs. This pattern points to a potential profit shift when measured in bitcoin terms.</p><p>This new BASIC investment vehicle is seeking to raise $5 million through the sale of its Series 1 BASIC Notes, priced at $115,000 each. The aim? To acquire ASICs in bulk now, store them and then strategically sell them as the market rebounds, especially keeping the upcoming Bitcoin halving event in April-May 2024 in mind.</p><p>Considering the resounding success of the Blockstream Mining Note (BMN), which attracted $50 million from global investors through eight rounds between 2021 and 2022, the BASIC Note's introduction has already garnered considerable market attention. This investment tool is designed to focus on a bitcoin-centric return strategy and fees are only charged when the product outperforms bitcoin.</p><p>Interestingly, the investment product will be pitched as an EU-compliant digital security on the Liquid Network. </p><p>The rationale behind the BASIC structure includes:</p><ul><li><strong>Market Forecasting</strong>: There’s a predicted surge in the bitcoin price, potentially from late 2023 to 2024. This is expected to couple with an increase in ASIC prices.</li><li><strong>Supply/Demand Dynamics</strong>: With the imminent Bitcoin “halving” event on the horizon, miners are likely to update their machinery, pushing demand for modern, energy-efficient devices.</li><li><strong>Liquidity and Access</strong>: As capital gradually becomes more available, miners will likely have better access to resources in order to procure ASICs.</li></ul><p>Blockstream CEO and Co-founder Dr. Adam Back remarked, “Since our founding in 2014, Blockstream has continuously been a leader in Bitcoin mining, from providing world-class mining infrastructure to delivering innovative investment vehicles like the Blockstream Mining Note. The BASIC Note arrives at an opportune time in the market, presenting a unique and carefully timed investment opportunity for any bitcoin-focused portfolio.”</p><p>Arnab Naskar, STOKR’s Co-founder, envisions digital securities transforming capital markets and believes that products like the BASIC Note will play a significant role in bridging traditional finance with Bitcoin.</p><p>It’s worth noting that the BASIC Note won't be accessible in every jurisdiction. Each Series will feature its own distinct set of BASIC Notes, issued via the Liquid Network.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTc5Mjk3ODEwMjM0NjE1NDQ3/blockstream-releases-first-enterprise-grade-product-on-liquid.jpg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Europe's First Spot Bitcoin ETF Now Listed On Euronext Amsterdam  ]]></title><description><![CDATA[Less than a week after the SEC delayed its decision on a spot Bitcoin ETF approval, Europe launches its first.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/europes-first-spot-bitcoin-etf-now-listed-on-euronext-amsterdam</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/europes-first-spot-bitcoin-etf-now-listed-on-euronext-amsterdam</guid><category><![CDATA[Jacobi Asset Management]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Euronext Amsterdam]]></category><category><![CDATA[Markets]]></category><category><![CDATA[BCOIN]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Nik Hoffman]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 15 Aug 2023 12:05:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjAwMDA2NDgzNjA0MTUzNzIw/f3qbdjrweaaojk5.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over a year after it's initial planned launch, Jacobi Asset Management has now officially <a href="https://jacobiam.com/news/press-release-15th-august-2023/">launched</a> Europe's first spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) on <a href="https://live.euronext.com/en/product/equities/GG00BMTPK874-XAMS">Euronext Amsterdam</a>.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1691412244091789312"></a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>Operating under the ticker BCOIN, the ETF is regulated by the Guernsey Financial Services Commission (GFSC), with Fidelity Digital Assets providing custodial services, while Flow Traders&nbsp;operate as market makers&nbsp;while Jane Street and DRW operate as Authorized Participants.

From Alexander Hamilton's<a href="https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/full-text"> “Federalist Papers</a>” to President Andrew Jackson's fierce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_War">battle against the Second Bank of the United States</a> and the ultimate creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, the allure of consolidating financial power has shaped the nation's monetary landscape. </p><p>However, amid the fervor for a centralized monetary authority, there is a cautionary note: Be wary of the erosion of financial privacy. The concentration of financial control leads to less individual sovereignty, as the watchful eyes of authority encroach on the sanctity of personal wealth. As this centralized leviathan grows in the face of diminishing individual autonomy, a disturbing truth emerges: financial privacy is shrinking in the shadow of a monolithic force that demands unquestioning compliance.</p><p>Bitcoin exists today in defiance of that centralized monetary control, after more than a century of central bank tyranny. The subsequent entrenchment of legal tender laws bestowed upon the government the sole authority to determine what money is and what it is not. As Austrian economist Carl Menger has <a href="https://cdn.mises.org/On%20the%20Origins%20of%20Money_5.pdf">pointed out</a>: </p><p>“Money is not an invention of the state. It is not the product of a legislative act. Even the sanction of political authority is not necessary for its existence.” </p><p>Therefore, the enactment of legal tender laws is in sharp contrast to any rational economic thought. Satoshi Nakamoto understood this and created a transparent monetary system for free-market actors to adopt, while taking away the power of central banks to create money. The government's monopoly over the issuance of currency is the foundation of its capacity to inflate the money supply. In addition, legal tender laws are the basis for attacking superior alternative monetary systems, such as Bitcoin, while simultaneously eroding financial privacy.</p><h2>Fighting An Expansion Of Authority</h2><p>The <a href="https://www.btctimes.com/news/coin-centers-case-dismissal-threatens-bitcoin-privacy">recent dismissal</a> of Coin Center’s <a href="https://www.coincenter.org/coin-center-has-filed-a-court-challenge-against-the-treasury-dept-over-unconstitutional-financial-surveillance/">challenge</a> to the expansion of <a href="https://www.coincenter.org/congress-takes-its-war-on-cash-to-digital-assets/">Section 6050I</a> of the tax code, which was part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Investment_and_Jobs_Act">Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) passed in 2021</a>, serves as a chilling example of the incremental outlawing of financial privacy. Section 6050I requires the reporting of cash or cash equivalents that exceed $10,000 and the amendment in the IIJA expanded this provision to include bitcoin and cryptocurrency businesses, traders and investors in the U.S. An immediate problem with treating digital assets as cash contradicts the IRS's determination that they <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf">are property</a>, not cash, for tax purposes. </p><p>That’s not all; in addition to meeting these reporting requirements, recipients of bitcoin or other cryptocurrency payments must also divulge personal details of the senders, such as their names, dates of birth and social security numbers. Furthermore, recipients are also required to maintain records of all of their transactions as well as the personal details of all senders for a period of five years. The privacy infringements of these provisions are glaringly obvious as they expand warrantless surveillance while turning everyone making these transactions into unofficial law enforcement agents. Without a successful appeal, the enforcement of this law commences on January 1, 2024.</p><h2>The Death Of Decentralization</h2><p>While <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoiners-must-do-more-to-warn-of-cbdc-dangers">the alarm has been sounded</a> on how central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are the death knell for financial privacy, this provision enables the powers that be to create blacklists of Bitcoiners and potentially target them individually for “tax violations” or in other ways that are unimaginable today. </p><p>A day prior to the dismissal of Coin Center’s challenge, U.S. Senators Jack Reed, Mike Rounds, Mark Warner and Mitt Romney unveiled the <a href="https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/bipartisan-us-senators-unveil-crypto-anti-money-laundering-bill-to-stop-illicit-transfers">Crypto Asset National Security Enhancement And Enforcement Act In The Senate (CANSEE)</a>, which aims to combat abuse of cryptocurrency protocols by criminals and enemies. While this bill may seem reasonable at first glance, it would make it infeasible to develop decentralized protocols in the U.S., while additionally posing a threat to financial privacy. <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/2355/text?s=3&r=1">Under the bill</a>, penalties would be extended to those who publish applications for digital asset transactions and who have “the power, directly or indirectly, to direct a change in the computer code or other terms governing the operation of the protocol, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury,” and this could include open-source software contributors. Furthermore the bill would also extend all of the <a href="https://www.occ.treas.gov/topics/supervision-and-examination/bsa/index-bsa.html">Bank Secrecy Act </a>obligations that now apply to financial institutions like cryptocurrency exchanges to those same persons. </p><p>In short, the bill would effectively ban the publication of open-source code for decentralized cryptocurrency protocols while giving the secretary of the U.S. Treasury virtually-unbounded discretion to decide who qualifies as someone who “controls” those protocols, as well as granting exemptions to centralized protocols that comply with regulations. This would give the government unprecedented control over the development and use of decentralized protocols. </p><p>Not only is this concentration of power concerning, but the bill evidently overlooks the fact that decentralized protocols like Bitcoin are designed to function peer to peer and in a non-intermediated way. Decentralization is one of the key pillars that distinguishes Bitcoin from everything else. This bill, in its current form, is an attempt to stifle innovation in the Bitcoin ecosystem by attacking decentralization.</p><p>Without decentralization, a major bulwark in preserving financial privacy will have been removed. While these laws do not affect the underlying code or architecture of Bitcoin, they could potentially slow down its adoption, while giving the government time to roll out a CBDC that would be marketed to the general public as a "digital asset you can trust." As a result, most people would unknowingly trade freedom for convenience.</p><h2>Trading Freedom For Convenience</h2><p>This potential is most evident in the Federal Reserve's newly-launched digital payment system, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHLnV9wu-5A">FedNow</a>, which enables instant transactions by default. </p><p><a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20230720a.htm">According to</a> Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, “The Federal Reserve built the FedNow Service to help make everyday payments over the coming years faster and more convenient.”<em> </em>As heartwarming as that sounds, FedNow is another step toward increased centralized control of the financial system as it lays the foundation necessary for the rollout of a CBDC. </p><p>It’s important to note that FedNow <em>is not</em> a CBDC, however it’s one of the key pieces of infrastructure in the gradual transition to a digital dollar. Once the complete digitalization of the fiat system is complete, extensive financial surveillance, data mining and control over individuals' financial choices will be the norm. As always, the standard "carrot and stick" approach is being used to encourage people to adopt this new system, with convenience being the carrot and, later on, jail time being the stick.</p><p>Unlike Bitcoin, FedNow is permissioned, grants the Fed the power to monitor as well as reverse or ban transactions and isn’t global. In other words, it’s the same as the current monetary system but with less freedom and privacy. The recent unilateral <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/07/18/nigel-farage-coutts-bank-account-closed-align-with-values/">shut down</a> of British politician Nigel Farage’s bank account serves as a cautionary tale of how reduced financial privacy can quickly morph into financial censorship for having differing political views. Therein lies the danger of permissioned digital financial infrastructure; its use depends on the benevolence of whoever controls it. The moment you are deemed to be “persona non grata” like Farage, you are immediately cut off from the financial system. If successful, FedNow will be the backbone for the American social credit system. The silver lining in all this is that the authoritarians are helping to make the case for permissionless and censorship resistant money like Bitcoin even stronger.</p><h2>Lurking In The Shadows</h2><p>In addition to predatory legislation and Orwellian CBDCs, blockchain surveillance companies, such as Chainalysis, are another threat to our financial privacy that lurks in the shadows. In addition to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/09/21/leaked-slides-show-how-chainalysis-flags-crypto-suspects-for-cops/">collecting the internet protocol (IP) addresses</a> of visitors to a <a href="http://walletexplorer.com/">block explorer </a>that it owns, Chainalysis also runs several Bitcoin nodes in a bid to mine as much data as possible that can be used to deanonymize Bitcoin users. While these methods are ultimately probabilistic at best, Chainalysis enjoys a <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/western-canada/">cozy relationship</a> with <a href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/investigation-fraud-and-risk/cryptocurrency-financial-crime/">law enforcement agencies</a>, which means that its “black box analysis” can be used to secure convictions. The case of Roman Sterlingov immediately comes to mind.</p><p>Sterlingov was <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/bitcoin-fog-dark-web-cryptocurrency-arrest/">arrested</a> in 2021 on charges of operating Bitcoin Fog, a Bitcoin mixing service. The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) alleges that he laundered a staggering $336 million through the mixer. According to an<a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/59856080/5/united-states-v-sterlingov/"> arrest warrant</a>, Sterlingov faces three charges: unlicensed money transmission, money laundering and money transmission without a license. Sterlingov's defense team, led by <a href="https://twitter.com/TorEkelandPLLC">Tor Ekeland</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mikehassard">Mike Hassard</a>, vehemently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8neTHW3BdU&pp=ygUfcm9tYW4gc3RlcmxpbmdvdiAgYml0Y29pbiBtaWFtaQ%3D%3D">maintains his innocence</a>, questioning the reliability of the blockchain analysis techniques employed to link him to the case and raising concerns about a possible conflict of interest involving Chainalysis. His defense further contends that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_limitations">statute of limitations</a> has lapsed on the charges against him, citing that the alleged activities took place back in 2011. </p><p>Elizabeth Bisbee, the director of investigative solutions at Chainalysis, made the following statement in <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/59988850/149/1/united-states-v-sterlingov/">an affidavit</a> intended to provide more information on Chainalysis' clustering methodology and error rate:</p><blockquote><p>“Historically, Chainalysis has not gathered and recorded in a central location false positives/false negatives because there is design to be more conservative in the clustering of addresses. In response to the Court’s inquiry, Chainalysis is looking into the potential of trying to collect and record any potential false positives and margin of error, but such a collection does not currently exist.”</p></blockquote><p>In a nutshell, this means that Chainalysis has not kept a record of the errors it makes when doing its blockchain analysis and is completely unaware of its false-positive rate. This calls into question the accuracy of its methods and, while the court has asked it to consider tracking any potential errors, it currently does not have a system in place to do so. This implies that Chainalysis' blockchain surveillance methods could potentially lead to erroneous conclusions, the extent of which are unknown at this stage. This point was also confirmed by Coinbase, a competitor of Chainalysis, in a<a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/part-1-blockchain-analytics-is-more-of-an-art-than-science"> blog post</a> describing blockchain analytics as “more an art than a science” with a high propensity for bias due to the quality and availability of evidence.</p><p>In the same statement, Bisbee added:</p><blockquote><p>“Chainalysis clustering methodologies have not been peer-reviewed in the sense that an academic paper would get peer-reviewed with data and methodology(ies) reviewed in a separate study by other scientists. However, every single clustering heuristic in the system has been reviewed by numerous Chainlaysis data scientists, intelligence analysts, and investigators that specialize in blockchain analytics. Chainalysis clustering algorithms are based on deep scientific research in cryptography, blockchains, distributed systems, and computer science.”</p></blockquote><p>Chainalysis is simply saying, “trust me bro” as its clustering methodologies have not been externally peer reviewed, thus raising more questions about the transparency and impartiality of its techniques. Without independent verification, it's hard to validate Chainalysis' clustering methods which have become essential tools in cybercriminal investigations. In short, the company claims its black-box methodology is based on solid scientific principles, but considering the fact that Sterlingov has already served over two years in prison and could get a 50-year sentence if convicted, more convincing evidence is required to substantiate this claim.</p><p>Given these circumstances, it would be reasonable to expect there to be corroborating evidence that points to Sterlingov and, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8jTkWzvbcw&t=431s">according to his lawyers,</a> none has been found. This is after <a href="https://www.nobsbitcoin.com/free-roman-sterlingov/">combing through</a> 3 terabytes of hard drives, SD cards, thumb drives, handwritten notes, backup account codes, laptops and smartphones that he had on his person at the time of his arrest. This ongoing case, which is set to go to trial on September 14, 2023, is an example of how far the state will go to attack your financial privacy. Sterlingov’s bitcoin holdings were acquired legitimately through early investments, unrelated to Bitcoin Fog, which he only utilized for privacy purposes. </p><p>The outcome of Sterlingov's case may shape the future application of these methods in legal proceedings, and could negatively impact how cases involving Bitcoin financial privacy are handled. </p><h2>Your Financial Privacy Is Under Attack</h2><p>These seemingly-unrelated accounts presented in this article all point to one thing; your financial privacy is under attack! Those in charge of the fiat system are more determined than ever to use every tool at their disposal, legislative or otherwise, to neuter Bitcoin while weaponizing the justice system against individual, privacy-conscious Bitcoiners, as in the case of Sterlingov. Fortunately we have the capabilities to develop new privacy-preserving tools that would render all these State-level attacks useless. </p><p>As Eric Hughes wrote in the<a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/static/docs/cypherpunk-manifesto.txt"> “Cypherpunk Manifesto</a>”: “We must come together and create systems which allow anonymous transactions to take place.” </p><p>Nakamoto gave us a head start with Bitcoin. We must continue to build tools to strengthen its censorship resistance and privacy. An example of this would be PayJoin transactions. PayJoin makes Bitcoin transactions more private by making it harder to track them, through the obfuscation of the origin and destination of funds, thus preventing chain surveillance companies like Chainalysis from linking them together. The recent release of the <a href="https://payjoindevkit.org/">PayJoin Development Kit</a> by Bitcoin Developer Dan Gould is a positive development that will ensure that as many Bitcoin services as possible integrate PayJoin. </p><p>The faster that these privacy enhancing tools can be developed, the easier it will be to ensure that dystopian monetary instruments like CBDCs and other privacy eroding technologies are dead on arrival.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Kudzai Kutukwa.

Spending outside of these allocations comes with huge markups and, as if this isn’t bad enough, saving is impossible as this money comes with an expiration date: after three months, it simply disappears from your account.</p><p>This dystopian world is closer than you think. Central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, could make it a reality. CBDCs are an attempt to duct-tape the failing monetary system back together, and in the process provide the State with nearly unlimited control over the financial system, and thus our spending habits and the way we lead our lives.</p><p>In this article, I explain the motivation for governments pursuing the CBDC programs, why it is one of the greatest threats to our freedoms today and what steps you can take to limit its impact on you and your family.</p><h2>All Fiat Fails</h2><p>Fiat currency is the only form of money most of us have known throughout our lives. It may seem natural and inevitable but when we look a bit farther into history, we find out that it’s anything but that; in fact, fiat currency seems more like a dead end in the context of monetary history.</p><p><a href="https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/why-was-gold-used-as-money-over-all-other-elements-56fd3f943f84">For thousands of years, mankind has converged to gold and silver as the dominant form of money.</a> Only for the past <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard">100 or so years have we diverged from this historic trend</a>. And the results have been disastrous. As Joakim Book noted in his<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-hyperinflation"> recent article on hyperinflations</a>, 61 out of the 62 documented cases of hyperinflation happened in the past 100 years — in the era of fiat money, when the ties to precious metals were cut.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Even when a currency isn’t undergoing hyperinflation, people and economies still suffer. A “regular” inflation in single or double digits is sufficiently destructive through its cumulative effect. Per my own calculations, inflation of 2% — <a href="https://www.centralbanknews.info/p/inflation-targets.html">a common inflationary target that many central banks aim for</a> — halves the purchasing power of the given currency in about 35 years, while the recent inflation rates around 10% manage to do so in seven years.</p><figure>

This is in essence what happened across Europe at the turn of the century, when the euro was rolled out: smaller currencies suffering from high inflation rates (such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_lira">Italian lira</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_drachma">Greek drachma</a> and <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2002/html/sp020228.en.html">Spanish peseta</a>) were overhauled into a new fiat currency that, at least until recently, allowed the establishment to kick the can down the road via rampant money printing and ballooning debts, as demonstrated in the chart below.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>The situation looks strikingly similar all around the world: money supplies inflating, purchasing power steadily declining, debt levels ballooning. The outcomes are the same, because the cause is the same: monetary systems based on currencies that can be printed at will are failing.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/SatsJoseph/status/1678670808019791872"></a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>Some governments reform their currency in a very naive way, by simply removing a couple of zeros from the existing denominations and calling it a day. A typical example of such a reform was the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarusian_ruble#Third_ruble,_2016%E2%80%93present"> 2016 overhaul of the Belarusian ruble</a>, during which the government simply scratched off four zeros from the currency.</p><p>Using central bank digital currencies is a slightly more sophisticated attempt at reforming failing monetary systems, though they won’t change fiat currencies in any fundamental way. If anything, CBDCs are putting more power in the hands of governments and will likely lead to an even greater erosion of the purchasing power of ordinary citizens.</p><h2>The Ultimate Corruption Of Money</h2><p>One of the most efficient ways to enslave a society is to destroy a currency’s two main functions: its roles as a <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/store-of-value">store of value</a> and as a medium of exchange.</p><p>Fiat currencies already ceased working as a reliable store of value a long time ago, through an intentional policy of permanent inflation. Preventing citizens from saving independently and incentivizing society to go into ever-deeper debts leads to a greater dependence on the state and its policies. Fiat currencies lead to debt slavery, and CBDCs won’t reverse this trend.</p><h2>CBDCs As A Store Of Value</h2><p>To understand why CBDCs will likely lead to a much greater erosion of the store-of-value function of money, let’s look at how today’s financial systems operate. Let’s take the U.S. banking system as an example (most financial systems around the world are structured in pretty much the same way). </p><p>The Federal Reserve, the U.S. central banking system, regulates the financial system and executes monetary policies. During and after the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS">implemented a very loose monetary policy with interest rates near zero to stimulate the economy</a>. This is where we get to a second crucial element of the U.S. financial system, in the form of commercial banks. Banks were unwilling to lend out the new inflow of money and instead deposited trillions of dollars with the Fed, as we can see on the chart below. This, in part, limited the effectiveness of the central bank’s policies.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk5OTU4NTgyMzcwODM4MTQ0/depistory-institution-reserves.png" height="430" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption><em>Source: </em><a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TOTRESNS"><em>FRED</em></a></figcaption>
    </figure><p>Now, if a CBDC was in place, it would be possible for the Fed to go around the commercial banks and deposit the newly-created money straight into the accounts of ordinary citizens, who would most likely spend it right away instead of saving it for a rainy day. Sounds great, right? Free money! But that’s precisely the problem: such money would be made out of thin air and would only contribute to an accelerated erosion of everyone’s purchasing power.</p><p>In terms of the store-of-value function of money, CBDCs would be worse than anything before, allowing the central bank to digitally “print” money at a pace previously unimaginable, depositing it straight into people’s accounts, and possibly even implementing an expiration date to the currency units.</p><h2>CBDCs As A Medium Of Exchange</h2><p>The freedom to transact is a prerequisite to pretty much all other freedoms. This might sound counter-intuitive, but keep in mind that money is used in half of all the economic transactions in a society — every single exchange of goods or services requires a handover of money. If money is under the full control of the State, then the State in turn gains control of almost everything that goes on in that society. Up until now, even the most totalitarian governments haven’t really had full control over all the transactions, as they haven’t found a way for the respective societies to function without cash. But CBDCs are meant as a full-fledged replacement of cash, and with the penetration of smartphones <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/539395/smartphone-penetration-worldwide-by-country/">over 80% in developed countries</a>, a fully-cashless society running solely on a State-managed CBDC is in sight.</p><p>Also, current payment systems, while offering some degree of control, are still quite decentralized. In the U.S. and EU, the national payment system is made up of dozens of commercial banks, payment providers, credit card companies and other services that comprise the payment ecosystem. Censoring payments in such environments is possible, but isn’t simple to execute and usually only happens when serious crime is suspected.</p><p>If CBDCs work as envisioned, a single entity — the central bank — would have full control over the national payment system, potentially allowing for simple interventions in terms of blocking the payments of anyone, realizing a totalitarian’s dream. It is precisely for these reasons that China has <a href="https://www.fpri.org/article/2023/06/china-is-doubling-down-on-its-digital-currency/">the most advanced CBDC program in the world</a>; should that be an example for the Western world?</p><h2>How Seriously Are Governments Pursuing CBDCs?</h2><p>Per<a href="https://www.nobsbitcoin.com/central-bank-digital-currency-tracker-2023/"> No Bullshit Bitcoin</a>, 130 countries representing 98% of global GDP are currently pursuing a CBDC program. According to the<a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/"> Atlantic Council CBDC Tracker</a>, which closely follows the progress of individual programs, 11 countries have already launched their respective digital currencies, 21 are in a pilot stage and the remainder are in various stages of research and development.</p><h2>CBDC Progress In The U.S.</h2><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/federalreserve/status/1504495248302645249"></a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>On its<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/central-bank-digital-currency.htm"> website</a>, the Fed states that it is exploring the potential benefits and risks from all possible angles. On the same page, it says that “as a liability of the Federal Reserve, however, a CBDC would be the safest digital asset available to the general public, with no associated credit or liquidity risk,” failing to acknowledge that while a CBDC might be superficially “safe” from the counterparty risk, the risk related to an inflationary policy would stay at least the same as with today’s cash. That is a common theme across the central banks’ communications on the topic of CBDCs — the elephant in the room in the form of pervasive inflation remains unaddressed. Obviously, a CBDC would be a continuation of the inflationary monetary policy.</p><p>We can also observe a growing opposition to a CBDC rollout, with Ted Cruz (a U.S. senator representing Texas)<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/texas-senator-ted-cruz-introduces-anti-cbdc-bill"> introducing an anti-CBDC bill</a>, while<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ron-desantis-banned-cbdcs-florida-203316120.html"> Florida</a> and<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/north-carolina-house-passes-bill-banning-cbdc-payments"> North Carolina</a> have outright banned the use of a federal CBDC in their borders.</p><h2>CBDC Progress In The EU</h2><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/ecb/status/1679725550099742721"></a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>In the eurozone, the efforts to introduce a digital euro — <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/digital_euro/html/index.en.html">the official term for Europe-wide CBDC</a> — seem more serious and less opposed. All of the progress reports and other relevant documents can be found on the<a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/search/html/central_bank_digital_currencies_cbdc.en.html"> European Central Bank’s (ECB’s) website</a>; an interesting one is a recent<a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2023/html/ecb.sp230623_1~80751450e6.en.html"> speech by Fabio Panetta</a> (a member of the ECB board), in which he strongly rails against bitcoin and stablecoins and warns against public support for independent cryptocurrencies, advising the public sector to “instead focus its efforts on contributing to the development of reliable digital settlement assets, including through their work on central bank digital currencies.”</p><p>According to some of the<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/eu-set-out-legal-underpinnings-digital-euro-2023-06-26/"> latest information</a>, the ECB will make a decision on whether to roll out the digital euro in October 2023.</p><h2>CBDC Progress In The U.K. And The Public Survey On “Britcoin”</h2><p>Trezor has recently conducted a survey among Britons to assess the level of awareness about the U.K.’s version of CBDC, colloquially called “britcoin.” The<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/trezor-study-shows-nearly-75-of-participants-have-concerns-over-digital-pound/"> findings</a> point out that the majority of the public is concerned about potentially-restricted access to their funds, imposed time conditions on the viability of the digital currency units and government control over which goods and services can be bought.</p><p>It’s unclear when a CBDC in the U.K. will be launched, but per the Bank of England’s<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/the-digital-pound"> website</a>, the intention to do so is palpable. The British central bank also makes a veiled threat to bitcoin there, with its statement that “there are also new forms of money on the horizon. Some of these could pose risks to the UK’s financial stability.”</p><h2>Mitigating CBDCs</h2><p>If the above-described prospects for central bank digital currencies concern you, I’ve got some good news: There’s plenty you can do to mitigate the risks of CBDCs.</p><p>First of all, it’s good to stay informed about CBDCs and alert others to the threat of such monetary reform. Ignorance is the main asset of central banks and governments: if the public feels that CBDCs are just a cosmetic change to existing systems and are better left to expert officials, that’s a major victory for the establishment. You can inform your friends and family about the dangers of full-fledged statist control of our money in understandable terms; everybody should understand the problem with the state defining what you can and cannot spend your money on, and the insanity of setting an expiration date to a currency unit.</p><p>Second, use cash whenever possible. One of the popular arguments for CBDCs is that people are no longer using cash and it needs to be replaced by a digital currency managed — and surveilled — by the central bank. Prove them wrong by using cash at every occasion. Cash is awesome: cash transactions are fully private, instantly settled and have no processing fees for the merchant.</p><p>Third, use bitcoin. Right now, bitcoin is mostly used for preserving purchasing power (at the time of writing, <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_price">bitcoin has appreciated by about 80% against the dollar since the beginning of the year</a>), but if CBDCs are launched and cash is banned, bitcoin will likely become the only way to spend your money freely. Bitcoin is permissionless and fully usable without any intermediary, and will remain so even after CBDCs are rolled out. It’s also quite likely that CBDCs won’t be freely convertible into bitcoin, so getting some bitcoin now while fiat is still convertible might be a good idea. Just keep in mind that you only truly own bitcoin if you hold the private keys. A bitcoin balance on an exchange isn’t owning bitcoin. For the best security, store your bitcoin in an open-source hardware wallet with a proven track record.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Under a CBDC regime, the statist monetary policies would continue the current trends of devaluation and censorship, with a limited means of escape if the introduction of that CBDC is accompanied by a cash ban. While a black market for currency, similar to those that exist today in countries with strong currency controls, would likely emerge and alleviate the impacts, the better outcome would still be if CBDCs were strongly opposed by the general public and never launched. The only real way out of today's monetary mess caused by decades of fiat policies is organic, bottom-up bitcoin adoption, as bitcoin has superior monetary characteristics to fiat and doesn’t need the state’s approval to function as proper money.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Josef Tětek.

Rising political interest in Bitcoin has culminated in the emergence of a so-called "<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/2022-orange-party-issue">orange party</a>," a movement characterized by Bitcoin enthusiasts transformed into single-issue voters. While the fervor surrounding this development is comprehensible, it is crucial to evaluate the potential ramifications of single-issue voting meticulously.</p><p>As Bitcoin continues to gain traction and mainstream recognition, its advocates are eager to see their preferred political candidates ascend to the highest office in the land. However, this eagerness must be tempered by a sober appreciation of the multifaceted nature of governance. Though tempting in its simplicity, single-issue voting often glosses over the intricacies of policy making and the interconnectedness of diverse issues. Individual liberty and freedom may be inadvertently imperiled if individuals place too great of an emphasis on a solitary concern.</p><p>While it's natural for people to be passionate about a particular cause or issue, especially when it comes to Bitcoin, elevating one concern above all others can be perilous for individual liberty. By prioritizing a single issue, individuals may unknowingly compromise their own freedoms or the rights of others. This approach can lead to the implementation of policies that restrict personal liberties and infringe on individual rights. Additionally, single-issue politics often breeds polarization and divisiveness, undermining efforts to find common ground and compromise in matters that protect individual freedom.</p><h2>Lysander Spooner's Philosophical Insights</h2><p>The philosophy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysander_Spooner">Lysander Spooner</a>, a notable 19th-century thinker, offers valuable insights into the concept of voting and its relationship with freedom. According to Spooner, the right to vote is an innate and natural right that cannot be granted or restricted by any institution or legal framework. However, he also recognized that participating in the political process can have unintended consequences, such as reinforcing oppressive systems through the State's monopoly on force and coercion.</p><p>Spooner's <a href="https://mises.org/wire/voting">perspectives on voting</a> as a form of self-defense continues to reverberate in contemporary political discourse. In an era where many individuals feel that their hard-earned resources are vulnerable to exploitation via taxation or other governmental measures, the act of casting a ballot can be viewed as a preemptive strike against fiscal assault. Nevertheless, this utilitarian approach to voting does not automatically translate into unequivocal support for the governing apparatus or its policies. </p><p>As Spooner astutely observed, the lines between genuine consent and mere self-preservation become blurred when voters engage in strategic voting motivated by fear rather than conviction. Thus, the tension between individual autonomy and collective governance remains a pressing concern, prompting further exploration into innovative models of decision making and community organization that prioritize authentic consent and collaborative problem solving.</p><p><a href="https://mises.org/wire/voting">To quote Spooner</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“In truth, in the case of individuals, their actual voting is not to be taken as proof of consent, even for the time being. On the contrary, it is to be considered that, without his consent having even been asked a man finds himself environed by a government that he cannot resist; a government that forces him to pay money, render service, and forego the exercise of many of his natural rights, under peril of weighty punishments. He sees, too, that other men practice this tyranny over him by the use of the ballot. He sees further, that, if he will but use the ballot himself, he has some chance of relieving himself from this tyranny of others, by subjecting them to his own. In short, he finds himself, without his consent, so situated that, if he use the ballot, he may become a master; if he does not use it, he must become a slave. And he has no other alternative than these two. In self-defence, he attempts the former. His case is analogous to that of a man who has been forced into battle, where he must either kill others, or be killed himself. Because, to save his own life in battle, a man takes the lives of his opponents, it is not to be inferred that the battle is one of his own choosing. Neither in contests with the ballot — which is a mere substitute for a bullet — because, as his only chance of self-preservation, a man uses a ballot, is it to be inferred that the contest is one into which he voluntarily entered; that he voluntarily set up all his own natural rights, as a stake against those of others, to be lost or won by the mere power of numbers. On the contrary, it is to be considered that, in an exigency into which he had been forced by others, and in which no other means of self-defence offered, he, as a matter of necessity, used the only one that was left to him.</p><p>“Doubtless the most miserable of men, under the most oppressive government in the world, if allowed the ballot, would use it, if they could see any chance of thereby meliorating their condition. But it would not, therefore, be a legitimate inference that the government itself, that crushes them, was one which they had voluntarily set up, or even consented to.”</p></blockquote><h2>Bitcoin Enthusiasts: Beyond Political Means</h2><p>The intricate nuances of political systems and their inherent constraints pose significant challenges for Bitcoin enthusiasts who seek to promote widespread adoption. The State's stranglehold on force and coercion renders political efforts to advance Bitcoin's cause potentially impotent or even counterproductive. Therefore, Bitcoiners must adopt a more multifaceted and resilient approach.</p><p>Rather than relying solely on political maneuvers, Bitcoin advocates should concentrate more of their energies on constructing parallel systems and fostering autonomous communities that function independently of State control. Consent-based systems and pervasive civil disobedience can serve as a more potent bulwark against State authority.</p><p>By creating and participating in alternative frameworks, we can aspire to undermine and circumvent traditional political powers. Through the support and development of decentralized networks and communities, we endeavor to establish a domain where individuals can interact and exchange value without the encumbrance of government intermediaries. This approach not only promotes financial inclusion and individual sovereignty but also nurtures a culture of resistance against oppressive hierarchies.</p><h2>The Path To Freedom: Advocating For A Brighter Bitcoin Future</h2><p>In conclusion, the ever-evolving relationship between Bitcoin and politics presents a captivating intersection of individual liberty and collective governance. As the impending U.S. presidential election sparks excitement within the Bitcoin community, we must tread carefully and thoughtfully, navigating the path to freedom with discernment.</p><p>The rise of the "orange party" is a testament to the growing significance of Bitcoin, yet it is essential to recognize the potential ramifications of single-issue voting. To preserve individual liberty and foster a resilient financial future, we must transcend the allure of simplistic solutions and embrace a multifaceted approach.</p><p>The profound insights of Spooner guide us in our quest for genuine consent and autonomy. While voting may sometimes be viewed as an act of self defense, it is not an unequivocal expression of consent, especially in the face of coercive structures. To promote a brighter Bitcoin future, we must explore innovative models of decision making and community organization that prioritize authenticity and collaboration.</p><p>Politics promises change yet coerces through centralized power. We must go beyond this illusion and act outside the system. True change happens not at the ballot box, but through grassroots education, adoption and the development of decentralized networks.</p><p>Let us become impassioned advocates for financial sovereignty, relentlessly educating and empowering our communities about the emancipatory promise of our peer-to-peer electronic cash system. Through persistent grassroots outreach, let us illuminate the transformative potential of decentralized sound money that cannot be debased or censored. We must patiently explain how tools like Bitcoin can enable ordinary people to opt-out of fiat manipulation and take control of their economic destinies. Our localization efforts should focus not just on spreading adoption, but on fostering active understanding so community members can wield financial autonomy as a means of independence and self-determination. Equipped with knowledge and agency, local networks can unravel the social control schemes of centralized money and develop resilient economies on their own terms and in their own interests. Let us become zealous-but-thoughtful champions dedicated to unlocking the liberatory possibilities of financial sovereignty. The first step is education and empowerment at the ground level.</p><p>Most importantly, we must ardently support the often-overlooked heroes — the developers tirelessly building censorship resistance into the technological backbone of this movement. Our appreciation must go beyond lip service and manifest through concrete actions. We can empower developers by donating to prominent projects, thereby providing the resources needed to strengthen the antifragility of our infrastructure. We can also fund bounties to incentivize features that expressly promote liberty, privacy and autonomy for users. For those able to contribute code, we must heed the call and directly participate in development. Even assisting with documentation and bug reporting strengthens the network. Developers are the beating heart of this mission, working thanklessly so that millions may attain financial freedom. Let us vigorously empower them to harden decentralized networks against coercion. Our contributions enable them to neutralize vulnerabilities before they are exploited to jeopardize liberty. A robust infrastructure is the only way to resist the threats of centralized powers seeking control. We must thus provide developers with the communal support they need to build technology that is censorship-proof, unstoppable and resilient in the face of any adversary, thereby securing financial autonomy for generations to come.</p><p>Progress happens not through idle hope, but daily, grassroots effort. Let us take concrete steps to further adoption and empower developers. Each small action brings us closer to emancipation from coercive structures. Through diligent work, we can build decentralized networks that circumvent centralized control. Voluntary communities, founded on financial autonomy, have no need for governing authorities. Politics promises change but is mired in a hollow spectacle. We must go beyond — building parallel systems that obsolete systems of coercion.</p><p>This is how we make self-sovereignty inevitable. Not by rhetoric or voting, but by groundwork. The revolution starts within our hearts, heads and hands. Our unified labor will inspire a future where financial freedom is not a distant dream, but a lived reality. We inch ever closer each time we patiently explain Bitcoin, fund censorship-resistant development and nourish community autonomy. Together, let us persist in this work one day at a time. At ballot boxes, change is only promised. But our efforts can guarantee it through perseverance. The future will remember not politicians, but those who toiled to build decentralized networks for the sake of autonomy. Where politicians fail, we will succeed.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Michael Matulef.

My background is in investing in climate tech. When I first heard about Bitcoin, I was highly skeptical and regarded it as a negative to the environment. However, I was persuaded to put prejudice to one side and evaluate it as I would any other technology I was doing due diligence on. After evaluating the claims and data from both sides I reached the conclusion that on net balance, Bitcoin had the unique ability to solve more than one difficult-to-solve climate-change issue.</p><p>First, some context: I have been a climate activist since the 1990s. Several years ago, I channeled this into working in the space of climate tech. Between 2014 and 2019, I traveled around New Zealand, hearing some of the smartest people in the country discussing their ideas, and helping them to commercialize them. Most of these ideas were some form of climate tech. I encountered over 200 different climate tech propositions during this time, and set up my first climate tech fund at the end of 2019.</p><p>Throughout that time, I never encountered a technology that had the immediacy, scalability and potential impact of Bitcoin mining using vented methane gas to measurably reduce global emissions pre-2030.</p><h2>Bitcoin Mining And Methane Emissions</h2><p>One day, as part of my work at the fund, I was reading an article about methane emissions.</p><p>It said that methane was 84-times more warming than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period, that it was rising parabolically and that the UN said "reducing methane is our strongest lever to reduce climate change!"</p><p>I was shocked. How, as a climate tech fund manager, could I have neglected addressing methane emissions?</p><p>I did some further research and found out that I wasn’t the only one. Out of every $1 spent on climate tech, only 2 cents was going toward methane mitigation, I found.</p><p>That day, I got brutally honest with myself and asked, “How much of a difference am I making?” There was no doubt that we were investing in some brilliant technologies and people that could reduce emissions on a global scale. But it turned out that a lack of emphasis on methane mitigation was not my only oversight.</p><p>The tech we invested in:</p><ol><li>Was high risk (it might never scale)</li><li>Would only reduce emissions post-2030</li><li>Wasn't addressing our most urgent emission issue</li></ol><p>I asked the question, “Could I be doing more?” The answer was, of course, “Yes.” I could be investing in technologies that were:</p><ol><li>Low risk</li><li>Able to measurably reduce emissions pre-2030</li><li>Able to address our number-one lever to reduce climate change in the next 25 years (methane)</li></ol><p>I started researching more about methane-mitigation technology. Most of it was like carbon-dioxide-emission technology: high-risk technology that wouldn’t be available until after 2030. While there was no doubt that we should also be investing in those technologies, that was no longer my focus.</p><p>I decided that if I were going to create a third fund, it would be optimized for immediate impact, and maximize emissions reduced per dollar invested. Otherwise, there was no point.</p><p>So, I began researching two things:</p><ol><li>How to use low-risk technology available immediately to reduce emissions pre-2030</li><li>What our major sources of methane were</li></ol><p>To answer the first question, I looked at proven ways to reduce methane emissions using existing technologies. Reading the work of experts from the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) and also the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), there was little doubt that the technology existed to perform methane mitigation at scale today: power generation.</p><p>In other words, capturing that methane and sending it to a generator, turning it into electricity. OK, that sounds like a good idea, particularly with energy prices spiking globally, I thought.</p><p>So, I turned to our second question, “Where is most of our methane coming from?”</p><p>The answer, I found, was agriculture, oil and gas and landfills.</p><p>However, of those three, the one that seemed the easiest to do something about quickly was also the one that my calculations told me would be our number-one methane emitter by 2032, overtaking agriculture: landfills.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>That led me to the question that changed everything I was doing: “Why isn’t this being done already?” As one expert who’d been doing landfill-based power generation projects since 2005 explained to me, “Landfills are never in the right place. In many cases, negotiating with the grid owner is complex and bureaucratic. And, even if you can do it, often the grid needs a major substation upgrade to be able to take that power. It ends up being too expensive.”</p><p>“But what if, rather than selling that power to the grid, you had someone who could use it on location, at the landfill?” I asked. </p><p>He shook his head. </p><p>“But who would want to do that?” he asked. “Landfills are smelly places, and the methane is a health hazard. No one would want to set up a business there.”</p><p>That was the point where two worlds suddenly collided for me. Several months earlier, I’d also been researching Bitcoin. Not because I thought it had any merits in terms of climate tech — in fact, I thought it was bad for the environment. It was simply a hobby. I like to get to the bottom of issues and understand the data behind them. Bitcoin was simply in that category.</p><p>I had environmentalist friends who told me that Bitcoin was bad for the environment. But I also had a friend in the Bitcoin community who told me that was nonsense based on people’s lack of understanding of Bitcoin mining.</p><p>The turning point came in late 2021 when I talked to Vlatko Materić, an environmentalist and the founder of one of our climate tech companies who challenged my assumptions about energy and Bitcoin, and encouraged me to dig deeper. I did, and quickly learned that he was right: Bitcoin’s location-agnostic features and high percentage of operating costs spent on electricity made it ideally suited to using stranded energy that no one else wanted or was able to access.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Listening to grid operators, bitcoin miners and renewable energy engineers was critical during this time. Had I relied on academic articles and journalism, I would have come away with some very different conclusions. When I did read the latter, by contrast, it became more and more apparent to me that they were critiquing a technology that they didn’t fully grasp. This lack of reliable data on Bitcoin's environmental impact from the articles and studies I read led me to do my own studies.</p><h2>Taking Climate Action With Bitcoin</h2><p>So, skipping forward in time, when that landfill expert said that no one would want to locate at landfills, I said to myself, “I know someone who definitely would.”</p><p>It turned out that others had already thought of that, and that two Bitcoin mining companies were either already doing landfill-gas-powered bitcoin mining, or on the cusp of doing it (<a href="https://www.nodalpower.com/">Nodal Power</a> and <a href="https://vespene.energy/">Vespene Energy</a>).</p><figure>

    </figure><p>When I did the math on Bitcoin using vented methane gas, it was a eureka moment. A fund that financed the deployment of infrastructure into Bitcoin mining using landfill gas could mitigate more emissions than any financial instrument I’d seen. It was 45-times more emission reducing than solar installations.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>To put the above chart into context, for someone living in the west, our calculations suggested that $108 could offset their emissions for the year. Less than $10,000 could offset their entire carbon footprint for a lifetime. We did some work to build a team, and come up with a business model that could return a steady yield to our wholesale investors, and that became the basis of the fund <a href="https://www.ch4capital.com/">CH4 Capital</a>.</p><p>I didn't start off as a Bitcoin advocate, but I've become one. My conclusion: There's probably never been a more important technology for our chances of mitigating runaway methane emissions, enabling the renewable transition and, as I found out along the way, giving financial sovereignty to more than 4 billion people.</p><p>For the first time ever, I feel there's something I can do beyond my own carbon footprint that could make a difference to our emission levels. It's a drop in the bucket, but it’s a start. And it's a start that we wouldn't have without Bitcoin.</p><p>That’s why I say: Bitcoin is climate action.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Daniel Batten.

The collective power of invested capital and market liquidity will always be the overriding factor.</p><h2>A Warm Embrace For Bitcoin, With Limits</h2><p>Bull market or bear market, Bitcoin is rarely out of the news. But it’s safe to say that 2023 has been a particularly-bubbly year in the BTC news cycle. BlackRock, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackRock#:~:text=BlackRock%2C%20Inc.%20is%20an%20American,as%20of%20December%2031%2C%202022.">world’s biggest asset manager</a> <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/blackrocks-top-equity-holdings-2023">with $9 trillion in assets under management (AUM)</a>, has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/blackrock-close-filing-bitcoin-etf-coindesk-2023-06-15/">applied</a> for a spot bitcoin ETF, with CEO Larry Fink <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/07/05/blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-says-bitcoin-could-revolutionize-finance">dubbing BTC</a> “an international asset.” Moreover, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/institutional-bitcoin-products-price-impact-ahead-of-halving">several other august financial institutions</a> have thrown their hats into the crypto ring with Bitcoin as their focus.</p><p>Many of these entities have bought into the asset’s “digital gold” narrative, pioneered by early maxis and subsequently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy8GwqvCHAM">popularized</a> by MicroStrategy’s <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/michael-saylor">Michael Saylor</a>. Instead of focusing on monetary uses, this approach views bitcoin as a long-term investment vehicle, inflation hedge and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/store-of-value">store of value</a>.</p><p>The warm embrace of prominent market players shows just how far bitcoin has come as an asset. There have been many landmarks and staging posts along the way, of course, and some turned out to be less consequential than others. </p><p>Two years ago, for instance, <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/11/10/starbucks-is-mixing-coffee-with-crypto">Starbucks made it possible to buy coffee with bitcoin</a> through a partnership with digital asset company Bakkt. Some hailed this momentous news while others shrugged. The truth is, I don’t see people flocking to pay for their Ristretto Bianco using their favorite cryptocurrency. The reason is not due to the underlying technology, nor regulations — and it’s definitely not that staff would have a hard time noting a wallet number on the cup. It’s because of the only thing about bitcoin that no one can guarantee a fix for in the future: the volatility of its price.</p><p>At the risk of stating the obvious, BTC is still not an instrument for buying coffee — although the ability to swap sats for single serve is nice. What Bitcoin represents is the evolution and adoption of a dynamic digital asset class. Every year, the network effects multiply and former claims of illegitimacy become progressively more preposterous. Oftentimes, an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/28/bitcoin-and-digital-assets-are-here-to-stay-says-nyse-chairman.html">old quote</a> from NYSE Chairman Jeff Sprecher springs to mind: “Somehow bitcoin has lived in a swamp and survived.”</p><h2>What Is Money, Anyway?</h2><p>But who are we to say what money is? To paraphrase two quotes from Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan (<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2002/200201163/default.htm">one of which</a> made me chuckle while the <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/1997/19971005.htm">other made me think</a>):</p><p>"I understand the history of money. When I get some, it's soon history.”</p><p>“It’s no longer possible to clearly define money, with ever expanding financial instruments.”</p><p>These comments were both made over 20 years ago, and as the sophistication of financial markets and products continues to expand, defining money and its role in the world is even more nuanced than ever before. You might argue that it doesn’t matter whether bitcoin is viewed as money; the fact that it’s deemed valuable is all that counts.</p><p>It could well turn out that both Bitcoin maxis<em> and</em> Wall Street are correct, that bitcoin is both money and a long-term store of value. In the near future, BTC will (most likely) be firmly categorized as an asset class unto itself, and diverse financial products will be derived from its underlying intrinsic value. Thereafter, wholesale investors could leverage the advantages of moving large value with reduced counterparty risk and immediate settlement, all done peer to peer, removing much of the unnecessary friction. Individuals, meanwhile, will continue using bitcoin as they see fit.</p><p>But here’s the rub: Although the tech is more or less ready, regulation is not. Across the world, regulation of cryptocurrency, specifically bitcoin as well as the wider infrastructure of blockchain technology, is playing catch up. In some regions, like the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/02/dubais-crypto-industry-welcomes-new-licensing-regime-amid-global-regulatory-uncertainty/">United Arab Emirates</a>, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/switzerland-s-financial-regulator-extends-reporting-requirements-for-crypto-transactions">Switzerland</a> and <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/singapore-composing-new-guidelines-for-banks-with-crypto-clients/">Singapore</a> to mention a few, regulators made bold decisions on digital assets supported by blockchains (<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/04/21/abu-dhabis-financial-free-zone-proposes-legal-framework-for-decentralized-economy/">hat tip to the Abu Dhabi Global Market [ADGM]</a> in my hometown). My prediction is that water will find its own level and participation will grow rapidly as we move forward.</p><p>Tying a bow on this letter, I should reiterate that markets are smarter than all of us — and capital goes hand-in-hand with the market. Sovereign nations will always want to be a part of the market economy and earn a piece of that capital pie! Whatever happens, don’t expect the Bitcoin business to die down (much less die) anytime soon.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by&nbsp;</em><em>Christopher Louis Tsu</em><em>.

I’ll explain that in more detail in a future essay, but a simple way to understand it is as a collection of information stored as chunks of data, that a language model can query and use to produce better responses. Imagine “The Bitcoin Standard,” split into paragraphs, and stored in this vector database. You ask this new “model” a question about the history of money. The underlying model will actually query the database, select the most relevant piece of context (some paragraph from “The Bitcoin Standard”) and then feed it into the prompt of the underlying model (in many cases, ChatGPT). The model should then respond with a more <em>relevant</em> answer. This is cool, and works OK in some cases, but doesn’t solve the underlying issues of mainstream noise and bias that the underlying models are subject to during their training.</p><p>This is what we’re trying to do at Spirit of Satoshi. We have built a model like what’s described above about six months ago, which you can go try out <a href="https://www.app.spiritofsatoshi.ai">here</a>. You’ll notice it’s not bad with some answers but it cannot hold a conversation, and it performs really poorly when it comes to shitcoinery and things that a real Bitcoiner would know. </p><p>This is why we’ve changed our approach and are building a full language model from scratch. In this essay, I will talk a little bit about that, to give you an idea of what it entails.</p><h2>A More ‘Based’ Bitcoin Language Model</h2><p>The mission to build a more “based” language model continues. It’s proven to be more involved than even I had thought, not from a <em>“technically complicated”</em> standpoint, but more from a <em>“damn this is tedious”</em> standpoint.</p><p><em>It’s all about data.</em> And not the quantity of data, but the quality and format of data. You’ve probably heard nerds talk about this, and you don’t really appreciate it until you actually begin feeding the stuff to a model, and you get a result… which wasn’t necessarily what you wanted.</p><p>The data pipeline is where all the work is. You have to <em>collect</em> and <em>curate</em> the data, then you have to <em>extract</em> it. Then you have to programmatically <em>clean</em> it (it’s impossible to do a first-run clean manually). </p><p>Then you take this programmatically-cleaned, raw data and you have to <em>transform</em> it into multiple data <em>formats</em> (think of question-and-answer pairs, or semantically-coherent chunks and paragraphs). This you also need to do programmatically, if you’re dealing with loads of data — which is the case for a language model. Funny enough, other language models are actually good for this task! You use language models to build new language models.</p><figure>

    </figure><p><em>Then</em>, because there will likely be loads of junk left in there, and irrelevant garbage generated by whatever language model you used to programmatically transform the data, you need to do a more intense <em>clean</em>.</p><p><em>This</em> is where you need to get human help, because at this stage, it seems humans are still the only creatures on the planet with the agency necessary to differentiate and determine <em>quality</em>. Algorithms can kind of do this, but not so well with language just yet — especially in more nuanced, comparative contexts — which is where Bitcoin squarely sits.</p><p>In any case, doing this at scale is incredibly hard unless you have an army of people to help you. That army of people can be mercenaries paid for by someone, like OpenAI which <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/openai">has more money than God</a>, or they can be missionaries, which is what the Bitcoin community generally is (we’re very lucky and grateful for this at Spirit of Satoshi). Individuals go through data items and one by one select whether to keep, discard or modify the data.</p><p>Once the data goes through this process, you end up with something clean on the other end. Of course, there are more intricacies involved here. For example, you need to ensure that bad actors who are trying to botch your clean-up process are weeded out, or their inputs are discarded. You can do that in a series of ways, and everyone does it a bit differently. You can screen people on the way in, you can build some sort of internal clean-up consensus model so that thresholds need to be met for data items to be kept or discarded, etc. At Spirit of Satoshi, we’re doing a blend of both, and I guess we shall see how effective it is in the coming months.</p><p>Now… once you’ve got this beautiful clean data out the end of this “<em>pipeline,</em>” you then need to <em>format</em> it once more in preparation for “<em>training</em>” a model.</p><p>This final stage is where the graphical processing units (GPUs) come into play, and is really what most people think about when they hear about building language models. All the other stuff that I covered is generally ignored.</p><p>This home-stretch stage involves training a series of models, and playing with the parameters, the data blends, the quantum of data, the model types, etc. This can quickly get expensive, so you best have some damn good data and you’re better off starting with smaller models and building your way up.</p><p>It’s all experimental, and what you get out the other end is… <em>a result…</em></p><p>It’s incredible the things we humans conjure up. Anyway…</p><p>At Spirit of Satoshi, our result is still in the making, and we are working on it in a couple of ways:</p><ol><li>We ask volunteers to help us collect and curate the most relevant data for the model. We’re doing that at <a href="https://repository.spiritofsatoshi.ai/">The Nakamoto Repository.</a> This is a repository of every book, essay, article, blog, YouTube video and podcast about and related to Bitcoin, and peripherals like the works of Friedrich Nietzsche, Oswald Spengler, Jordan Peterson, Hans-Hermann Hoppe, Murray Rothbard, Carl Jung, the Bible, etc.<br><br>You can search for anything there and access the URL, text file or PDF. If a volunteer can’t find something, or feel it needs to be included, they can “add” a record. If they add junk though, it won’t be accepted. Ideally, volunteers will submit the data as a .txt file along with a link.<br><br></li><li>Community members can also <a href="https://www.spiritofsatoshi.ai/#/help-training">actually help us clean the data, and earn sats</a>. Remember that missionary stage I mentioned? Well this is it. We’re rolling out a whole toolbox as part of this, and participants will be able to play “FUD buster” and “rank replies” and all sorts of other things. For now, it’s like a Tinder-esque keep/discard/comment experience on data interface to clean up what’s in the pipeline. <br><br>This is a way for people who have spent years learning about and understanding Bitcoin to transform that “work” into sats. No, they’re not going to get rich, but they can help contribute toward something they might deem a worthy project, and earn something along the way.</li></ol><h2>Probability Programs, Not AI</h2><p>In a few previous essays, I’ve argued that “artificial intelligence” is a flawed term, because while it <em>is</em> artificial, it’s <em>not</em> intelligent — and furthermore, the fear porn surrounding artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been completely unfounded because there is literally no risk of this thing becoming spontaneously sentient and killing us all. A few months on and I am even more convinced of this.</p><p>I think back to John Carter’s excellent article <a href="https://barsoom.substack.com/p/im-already-bored-with-generative">“I’m Already Bored With Generative AI”</a> and he was so spot on.</p><p>There’s really nothing magical, or intelligent for that matter, about any of this AI stuff. The more we play with it, the more time we spend actually building our own, the more we realize there’s no sentience here. There’s no actual thinking or reasoning happening. <em>There is no agency</em>. These are just “probability programs.”</p><p>The way they are labeled, and the terms thrown around, whether it’s “AI” or “machine <em>learning</em>” or “agents,” is actually where most of the fear, uncertainty and doubt lies. </p><p>These labels are just an attempt to describe a set of processes, that are really unlike anything that a human does. The problem with language is that we immediately begin to anthropomorphize it in order to make sense of it. And in the process of doing that, it is the audience or the listener who breathes life into Frankenstein’s monster.</p><p><strong>AI has <em>no</em> life other than what you give it with your own imagination.</strong> This is much the same with any other imaginary, eschatological threat.</p><p><em>(Insert examples around climate change, aliens or whatever else is going on on Twitter/X.)</em></p><p>This is, of course, very useful for globo-homo bureaucrats who want to use any such tool/program/machine for their own purposes. They’ve been spinning stories and narratives since before they could walk, and this is just the latest one to spin. And because most people are lemmings and will believe whatever someone who sounds a few IQ points smarter than them has to say, they will use that to their advantage.</p><p>I remember talking about regulation coming down the pipeline. I noticed that last week or the week before, there are now “official guidelines” or something of the sort for generative AI — courtesy of our bureaucratic overlords. What this means, nobody really knows. It’s masked in the same nonsensical language that all of their other regulations are. The net result being, once again, “We write the rules, we get to use the tools the way we want, you must use it the way we tell you, or else.”</p><p>The most ridiculous part is that a bunch of people cheered about this, thinking that they’re somehow safer from the imaginary monster that never was. In fact, they’ll probably credit these agencies with “saving us from AGI” because it never materialized.</p><p>It reminds me of this:</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk5OTM5MTgwOTI5NzU0NzUy/awake-yet.jpg" height="777" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>When I posted the above picture on Twitter, the amount of idiots who responded with genuine belief that the avoidance of these catastrophes was a result of increased bureaucratic intervention told me all that I needed to know about the level of collective intelligence on that platform.</p><p>Nevertheless, here we are. Once again. Same story, new characters.</p><p>Alas — there’s really little we can do about that, other than to focus on our own stuff. We’ll continue to do what we set out to do.</p><p>I’ve become less excited about “GenAI” in general, and I get the sense that a lot of the hype is wearing off as people’s attention moves onto aliens and politics again. I’m also less convinced that there is something substantially transformative here — at least to the degree that I thought six months ago. Perhaps I’ll be proven wrong. I do think these tools have latent, untapped potential, but it’s just that: latent. </p><p>I think we have to be more realistic about what they are <em>(instead of artificial intelligence, it’s better to call them “probability programs”)</em> and that might actually mean we spend less time and energy on pipe dreams and focus more on building useful applications. In that sense, I do remain curious and cautiously optimistic that something does materialize, and believe that somewhere in the nexus of Bitcoin, probability programs and protocols such as Nostr, something very useful will emerge. </p><p>I am hopeful that we can take part in that, and I’d love for you also to take part in it if you’re interested. To that end, I shall leave you all to your day, and hope this was a useful 10-minute insight into what it takes to build a language model.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Aleksander Svetski.

This came after it was <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/08/binance-lifts-block-on-bitcoin-withdrawals-amid-heavy-volumes.html">forced to halt bitcoin withdrawals</a> for several hours in May 2023 due to a sudden surge in transaction volume, which led to an increase in processing fees.</p><p>This integration for Binance marked a significant milestone, as it prompted introductions and deepening talks about the Lightning Network as a <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1655419624962527233">long-term solution</a> for managing substantial transaction volumes in the future. The potential for the Lightning Network to counter sluggish transaction speeds and high energy costs also seems to have reached the ears of the executives at Coinbase. Should Coinbase <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1644794656570617856">opt</a> to integrate the Lightning Network into its platform (<a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1686596515765362688?s=46">which CEO Brian Armstrong is hinting it will</a>), it would <a href="https://github.com/theDavidCoen/LightningExchanges#readme">follow</a> in the footsteps of Binance and other big exchanges like <a href="https://ln.bitfinex.com/">Bitfinex</a>, <a href="https://blog.kraken.com/product/kraken-now-supports-instant-lightning-network-btc-transactions#:~:text=Kraken%20is%20thrilled%20to%20announce,now%20live%20for%20all%20clients.">Kraken</a> and <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/01/06/uk-exchange-coincorner-adds-bitcoin-lightning-network-support/">CoinCorner</a>.</p><h2>How The Lightning Network Helps Scale Bitcoin</h2><p>The <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/how-does-the-lightning-network-work">Lightning Network</a> is a second layer for Bitcoin that uses micropayment channels which allow for more efficient and less expensive transactions. Essentially, it was designed to solve scalability limits associated with Bitcoin by introducing off-chain transactions. Even when the Bitcoin mempool — the holding area for transactions awaiting confirmation — is full or busy, the Lightning Network is unaffected.</p><p>As a fairly-new technology, the Lightning Network, first <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/understanding-the-lightning-network-part-building-a-bidirectional-payment-channel-1464710791">proposed</a> by Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja in 2016, has been under development and refinement over the past several years. It is innovative, ambitious and promising. But it is the rapid and strategic adoption in unexpected corners of the globe that is capturing the attention of industry insiders. A case in point is the Philippines, a developing nation in Southeast Asia, which is making significant strides in harnessing the power of the Lightning Network to revamp transactions and fortify its financial ecosystem.</p><h2>A Promising Use Case In The Philippines</h2><p>The Philippines is among <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/20166/top-10-remittance-receiving-countries/">the top-five countries in terms of remittances received worldwide</a>. In 2022, these remittances <a href="https://www.philstar.com/business/2023/02/16/2245201/remittances-hit-record-high-361-billion-2022">reached</a> a record high of $36.14 billion, demonstrating the pivotal role of overseas Filipino workers in supporting the nation's economy. This figure is only expected to grow, with the World Bank <a href="https://www.philstar.com/business/2022/12/02/2227874/philippines-among-top-recipients-remittances-year-">predicting</a> remittances to the country could rise to $39 billion by the end of 2023.</p><p>The integration of the Lightning Network into the country's financial fabric could ease the burden of these overseas workers, who often wrestle with high fees and inefficiencies tied to remittances through the traditional financial system.</p><p>The potential impact of the Lightning Network in the Philippines has become evident with digital payment platforms leveraging this technology, facilitating faster, more secure remittances, primarily from the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/strike-launches-remittances-to-philippines">U.S.</a>, which posted <a href="https://www.philstar.com/business/2023/02/16/2245201/remittances-hit-record-high-361-billion-2022">the highest share of overall remittances to the Philippines in 2022 at 41.2%</a>, and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/neutronpay-and-pouch-ph-now-offer-lightning-remittances-for-canada-and-vietnam">Canada</a> which <a href="https://www.philstar.com/business/2023/02/16/2245201/remittances-hit-record-high-361-billion-2022">accounted for 3.6%</a>.</p><p>Moreover, the Philippines is witnessing a burgeoning digital economy, which according to a recent study, could <a href="https://news.abs-cbn.com/business/11/24/22/ph-fastest-growing-digital-economy-in-se-asia-study">reach</a> $35 billion in 2025, growing at a 20% annual rate, and could hit $100 billion to $150 billion by 2030. A significant portion of this digital economy is driven by micro-, small- and medium enterprises (MSMEs), which serve as the backbone of the Philippine economy, where they <a href="https://www.bworldonline.com/special-features/2022/12/21/494399/strengthening-the-countrys-economic-backbone/">comprise</a> 99% of businesses and employ 63% of the workforce.</p><p>Despite its considerable size and role, the vast MSME market is underserved, marking a technological gap. As it stands, this sector underperforms, as it <a href="https://www.bworldonline.com/special-features/2022/12/21/494399/strengthening-the-countrys-economic-backbone/">only contributes 40% of the country’s gross domestic product</a>. This discrepancy indicates that a significant amount of growth potential remains unrealized, signaling a prime opportunity for further digital transformation.</p><p>Digitization for MSMEs, however, is only one piece of the puzzle. The next step in their technological evolution could very well be the integration of the Lightning Network into their operations.</p><p>The Lightning Network has already catalyzed growth for <a href="https://technode.global/2023/06/06/more-than-400-small-businesses-in-the-philippines-now-accept-bitcoin-payments/">hundreds of small businesses</a>, not just in major cities but also <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/el-salvador-one-small-step-for-bitcoin">in</a> <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/inside-guatemalas-bitcoin-lake">smaller</a> <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-beach-brazil-inspire-el-salvador">provinces</a> as they started accepting and processing bitcoin payments. This allows them to tap wider customers, specifically foreign tourists who prefer to spend or pay in bitcoin.</p><p>Thus, this revolutionary action is hitting two economies: tourism and local entrepreneurship. The Lightning Network is proving instrumental in unlocking the unrealized potential of MSMEs, catalyzing their growth, and in turn, further fueling the digital economy.</p><h2>There’s More To Unravel</h2><p>The Lightning Network is a powerful example of how developing countries like the Philippines can leapfrog traditional infrastructural limitations and harness cutting-edge technologies to propel their economic advancements. But there is still more to explore in the associated technologies that can make utilizing the Lightning Network easy and effective.</p><p>One of the most exciting developments is the potential mainstream adoption of “tap-to-pay” via NFC-enabled cards and mobile phones, akin to things like Apple Pay or Google Pay. Likewise, given <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1326447/philippines-qr-code-usage-rate-for-payments/">the popularity of QR-code-based payments in the Philippines</a>, the transition towards more advanced, contactless transactions seems like a natural progression.</p><p>This could position the Lightning Network as a better alternative to traditional payment methods like cash, debit and credit cards, ushering in a new era of convenience for 10 million Filipinos who <a href="https://bitpinas.com/fintech/10-million-filipinos-remain-unbanked-world-bank/">remain unbanked</a>. With its capacity to facilitate quicker and more affordable transactions, the Lightning Network is well positioned to democratize access to financial services, laying the foundation for a more inclusive economic landscape.</p><p>The transformative potential of the Lightning Network across various sectors is clear, but this is not to say that the journey is without its hurdles. There are technical complexities, <a href="https://bitpinas.com/feature/consensys-crypto-regulated-philippines/">regulatory challenges</a>, and widespread adoption and <a href="https://www.cnnphilippines.com/business/2020/12/18/common-cryptocurrency-scams-and-how-to-avoid-them.html">education</a> concerns that need to be addressed. But if navigated wisely, Bitcoin and the Lightning Network can be potent tools in empowering the Philippines economically, creating a model for other developing economies to emulate.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Ethan Rose.

    </figure><h2>When You Want To Know ‘The’ Price Of Bitcoin, Where Do You Look?</h2><p>There is no single price of bitcoin. Every second of the day, there are thousands of exchanges, brokers, OTC desks, payment companies and other market participants around the world quoting the price of bitcoin — and none of them is always correct.</p><p>In this article, we will explore a new way of interpreting the Bitcoin UTXO set that accurately reflects a bitcoin price at each block height and has the potential to serve as the foundation for a new era of trust-minimized, decentralized finance on Bitcoin.</p><p>What trust-minimized tools could you build if you could calculate an accurate price for bitcoin at each block height, using only your Bitcoin full node and an open-source model?</p><ul><li>DLC derivatives (options, futures, perpetual futures)</li><li>On-chain lending markets</li><li>Peer-to-peer marketplaces</li><li>Bitcoin-backed USD stablecoins on Lightning</li><li>Stable-value USD accounts denominated in bitcoin</li><li>Any use case that requires a USD component</li></ul><p>Any one of these concepts, successfully implemented on the Bitcoin blockchain in a trust-minimized way, could deliver tremendous value to both Bitcoiners — utilizing bitcoin for its superior monetary properties — and participants in the Bitcoin ecosystem who need to remain partially tied to USD but want to utilize Bitcoin as their settlement network.</p><h2>On-Chain Transactions Encapsulate The Global Signal Of Economic Weight</h2><p>During the 2016 to 2017 “Blocksize Wars,” the merits of not only running a fully-validating Bitcoin node, but conducting economic activity using your node, were convincingly argued in helping the network avoid a meaningful fork that could have delayed Bitcoin’s success.</p><p>For purposes of our current discussion, it can be said that this tumultuous time in Bitcoin’s history emphasized that, in the same way that someone can run 1 million “full nodes” on a cloud server that signal for a particular “upgrade” but not influence the network of economic actors in any way if they are not actively settling transactions, centralized exchanges can produce volume and price statistics that, in reality, do not carry economic weight, and which are not reflected in the UTXOs that are settled onto the Bitcoin blockchain.</p><p>You can temporarily give the appearance of having more bitcoin than you do within a closed system like an exchange, but as long as there is a credible threat of withdrawal for settlement to the Bitcoin base layer, any mispricing within the closed system will eventually resolve itself back to equilibrium with the external market.</p><p>For example, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/mt-gox-bitcoin-hack-teaches-us-today">when Mt. Gox was insolvent in 2013 to 2014, but before it officially collapsed</a>, the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-MBB-16793">reported price of bitcoin on the platform was markedly different from other exchanges</a> due to the fact that Mt. Gox did not have nearly as much bitcoin as it claimed. As a result, it needed to entice new users to deposit to the exchange in order to fulfill withdrawals from existing customers. Within the Mt. Gox system, the price could be manipulated, but when users attempted to arbitrage the price back to the market, Mt. Gox collapsed.</p><p>In contrast, the Bitcoin blockchain is the hardest ledger in the world to corrupt. It represents the entire history of economic settlement activity to have occurred and is the final arbiter of truth with regard to the status of all bitcoin in existence.</p><p><strong>Transactions that matter are settled on the Bitcoin blockchain, not in closed systems. Final settlement is what matters.</strong></p><h2>UTXOs Are Created And Destroyed Each Time You Move Bitcoin</h2><p>People have a difficult time grasping Bitcoin, since it’s impossible for them to take a physical coin out of their pocket, point to it, and say, “This is a bitcoin.” </p><p>One analogy I’ve gravitated toward when describing a specific amount of bitcoin in a person’s possession is visualizing an individual bill in a physical wallet. These bills can represent any amount and are only good for one use. So, if you need to spend $3, and only have a $100 bill, you can’t rip off a corner of the bill. You would need to spend the entire $100 bill and get your change back. In Bitcoin parlance, each of these bills is a UTXO. Any time you send bitcoin, you are spending (and destroying) at least one UTXO while simultaneously creating at least one new one. If you run any version of the Bitcoin software, at any point in time you can count up all the bitcoin contained in existing UTXOs to determine exactly how much bitcoin currently exists.</p><p>In fact, when used together, the <strong>Bitcoin blockchain and UTXO set are perfectly accurate in determining the history and current state of the Bitcoin network</strong>. This never-before-seen capability in a decentralized system helped the <a href="https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/cryptocurrency/articles/19-million-bitcoin-have-been-mined-only-2-million-remain-unminted/">19 million bitcoin currently in existence</a> grow to be worth <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">several hundred billion dollars</a>.</p><p>The Bitcoin software uses units of bitcoin (satoshis) for its internal accounting. While it may be obvious that 1 bitcoin equals 1 bitcoin, this also means that when someone wants to “send $100 of bitcoin,” the participants in this transaction need to agree on the price of bitcoin at the time of the transaction to know how much bitcoin this corresponds to.</p><h2>On Average, 15% Of All Bitcoin Transactions Are In Round USD Values</h2><p>Did you know that many people transact bitcoin in round USD amounts? Interestingly, because this is such a common occurrence, <strong>there are clearly-recognizable patterns that exist in the UTXO set that can be used to closely infer the price of bitcoin at any point in the past or present</strong> (see the chart below).</p><p>Imagine that you are buying bitcoin at an ATM (or buying a gift card online). Will you buy $100 worth or $39.27 worth?</p><p>Round USD values ranging from $1 up to several thousand dollars are very common denominations in the Bitcoin blockchain. In fact, since 2014, there has been a growing on-chain footprint of these round-USD-value bitcoin transactions which on some days can account for up to 25% of daily outputs created.</p><p>The United States has <a href="https://coinatmradar.com/charts/geo-distribution/">by far the largest installed base of Bitcoin ATMs globally</a>. U.S. Bitcoin ATM operators have grown dramatically since 2019 and the Bitcoin UTXO set vividly displays this market’s growth as more people choose to hold or at least transact in bitcoin over USD.</p><p>Also, as seen with clients at sFOX, Bitcoin ATM flows are made of nearly all customer buys (putting cash into an ATM and receiving bitcoin), so the on-chain footprint of this activity consolidates signals at round USD values. Other large bitcoin markets, such as gift cards, peer-to-peer exchanges, and many other, less common use cases, also contribute to this pattern of USD-denominated bitcoin usage.</p><h2>The Bitcoin UTXO Set As Of Block 772,298</h2><p>There is only one bitcoin UTXO set at any given block height. This picture depicts the entire, approximately 70 million UTXOs that comprise all 19 million bitcoin in existence, as of block 772,298.</p><p>With Bitcoin being truly permissionless, anyone running a fully-validating Bitcoin node has this exact same data on their computer and can independently replicate this exact same dataset for this point in time. A live version of this visualization can be seen and interacted with at <a href="https://utxo.live/">utxo.live</a>.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Zooming into the 2022 section of the chart highlights that <strong>there are consistent patterns in the UTXO set</strong>. We’ll focus on two such patterns: <strong>Horizontal lines</strong> and <strong>wavy lines</strong>.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk5ODIyMDIzMzQ4NzI0ODM5/utxo-set-2.png" height="376" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption><a href="https://utxo.live/"><em>Source</em></a></figcaption>
    </figure><p>Horizontal lines (the flat lines) represent:</p><ul><li>UTXOs denominated in <strong>round values of bitcoin</strong> (e.g., 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 1, etc.)</li><li>Flat at any USD price because sending <strong>1 btc always equals 1 btc</strong></li></ul><p>Wavy lines: </p><ul><li>Represent groupings of UTXOs denominated in round USD values ($1, $20, $50, $100, $200, $500, $1,000, etc.)</li><li>Are very wavy, yet parallel to each other because people send in many USD denominations and these denominations all move in proportion to each other as the BTC/USD price changes</li><li>Move inversely to price. BTC/USD price increases cause the wavy lines to slope down since it takes less BTC to equal a USD value as price moves up and vice versa.</li></ul><h2>Making Sense Of The Lines</h2><p>The fact that horizontal lines exist isn’t all that impressive. People transacting in bitcoin often transact in round amounts of bitcoin.</p><p><strong>But the fact that the wavy lines exist clearly and consistently is a big deal</strong>. It means that, given an open-source model, this could help bring about the ability to:</p><ul><li>Independently calculate the price of bitcoin using only your full node at any block height</li><li>Develop genuine DeFi applications without the need for (or without sole reliance upon) trusted third-party price oracles</li></ul><h2>The UTXOracle Price Model Has Native Logic Checks</h2><p>How can you easily test the hypothesis that the wavy lines represent movement of bitcoin denominated in USD? Simply pick a date when you know the BTC/USD price crossed a round USD value and see if the horizontal and wavy lines cross.</p><p>One such case is July 27, 2020. Bitcoin was recovering from the March 2020 mayhem and <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD/history?period1=1410825600&period2=1598227200&interval=1d&filter=history&frequency=1d">crossed over $10,000 per BTC</a>.</p><p>The image below shows the wavy line (USD) crossing down below the horizontal line (BTC) at the same time that the price rose above $10,000 per BTC. This particular image is the 10,000 sat (0.0001 BTC) line, but the same pattern exists at many other BTC denominations as you progress up the UTXO chart.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Clearly, <strong>the wavy lines on the chart show transactions denominated in USD</strong>.</p><p><strong>This has enormous ramifications</strong>, since the wavy line pattern exists in varying degrees in every block, and is extremely consistent over rolling periods such as every 144 blocks (roughly 24 hours).</p><h2>The UTXOracle USD Bitcoin Price Is Quite Accurate</h2><p>Seeing the horizontal and variable lines cross at round USD values is nice, but a majority of the time, the lines are not very close to one another. <strong>We need a way to prime a pricing model from these crossing points that will infer an accurate, current price at any block height after the model is primed.</strong></p><p>Enter the UTXOracle model.</p><p>In this preliminary model, an input date of July 27, 2020, a day when bitcoin rose above $10,000, is used to prime the model to a best fit for that day’s price. <strong>Using only this single day’s UTXOs, and an input of that single day’s volume-weighted average price (VWAP), we are able to create a model that, when used with a future date’s UTXO set changes, infers the daily price of bitcoin with remarkable accuracy from this day forward, utilizing only the Bitcoin UTXO set with no reference to any external price data after July 27, 2020.</strong></p><p>The <strong>red line</strong> is the daily VWAP from sFOX, an aggregator whose price encompasses the filled trades from dozens of exchanges and OTC desks.</p><p>The <strong>blue line</strong> is the UTXOracle daily price calculation based on each day’s UTXO changes.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>For the measurement period of July 2020 to January 2023, <strong>the model performs exceptionally well, with daily median and daily average variances between the actual VWAP and the UTXOracle price of 0.65% and 1.04%</strong>, respectively, both of which are within the normal range of fees charged for bitcoin purchases at <a href="https://money.com/paypal-venmo-new-cryptocurrency-fees/">retail</a> <a href="https://help.coinbase.com/en/exchange/trading-and-funding/exchange-fees">exchanges</a>.</p><p>It’s been said that all models are wrong, but some models are useful. One key difference between the UTXOracle model and other models that output a bitcoin price is that <strong>the UTXOracle model does not seek to predict a future price. It merely attempts to infer an accurate current price based on recent blocks and corresponding changes in the UTXO set</strong>. Given that the current model has also not been fine tuned for a best fit and simply uses a single primer date for its input, the model is clearly wrong — hopefully it can be useful.</p><h2>The UTXOracle Model Has Trade-Offs</h2><p>If Bitcoin has taught me anything, it’s that trade-offs exist. The UTXOracle model is no different.</p><p>The Bitcoin UTXO set is a beautiful, living monument to the human spirit but try as we may, any model created from it will not fully encapsulate the entirety of the underlying activity which it represents. A map cannot be as accurate as the territory it represents.</p><p>The UTXOracle model relies on several concepts to function correctly:</p><ul><li>Bitcoin UTXO data (free and widely-available data accessed by running a full node)</li><li>Bitcoin price data to identify a time or series of times upon which to prime the model (based on free and widely-available data)</li><li>A model to apply the primer date(s) generally to any date (there are many ways to optimize this)</li><li>A way for users of the UTXOracle output price to utilize the price in DeFi applications (this needs significant effort to develop)</li></ul><p><strong>People may create UTXOs at amounts that would mimic the price being another level than reality.</strong></p><p>On centralized venues, <a href="https://www.coinbureau.com/analysis/cryptocurrency-spoofing/">people have been known to “spoof” large buy or sell orders</a> in an order book to make it seem as though there is a large buyer or seller in the market, only to later remove these buy/sell orders without actually having any trades filled. This can actually move markets on centralized venues, but you cannot spoof UTXOs. They either exist in a mined block or they do not.</p><p><strong>It takes a long time to create a fake price signal and it’s obvious when someone tries to do so.</strong></p><p>Currently, it looks as though using a daily UTXOracle signal, rather than a single block interval, achieves a price accurate enough to use in practice. This approach has the added benefit of greatly increasing the cost of attack in mimicking or censoring transactions which would be most useful in producing the UTXOracle price at any certain time.</p><p>Even if someone created many UTXOs at levels mimicking a different bitcoin price, there is no mechanism to remove the real transactions that reflect the accurate price. At best, an attacker would create an additional set of wavy lines.</p><p><strong>UTXOs are expensive to fake.</strong> There is no such thing as “spam” in the Bitcoin blockchain. There are only transactions that pay a fee to be included in a block. This means that blockchain data is expensive to produce or censor and there is a real cost of capital in creating UTXOs to fake a price signal.</p><p><strong>Current model accuracy diminishes after about two years</strong>, as is visible in the chart. In practice, it’s likely that a model will need to be recalibrated after some period of time. Changing the model to take into account different UTXO patterns carries much less risk than changing consensus rules in Bitcoin. Unless participants are transacting in multi-year options/futures contracts on chain, this is likely not a meaningful barrier to use.</p><p><strong>The current model does not deal with extreme volatility well.</strong> Mempool variations and price volatility create situations where the UTXOracle price can temporarily vary from the centralized exchange price by more than 10%. While this can likely be improved upon with a more comprehensive model it does highlight a potential serious limitation of the practical use of the model.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Then there is the AI echo chamber problem: If the model is very successful, it may become less effective.</strong> In a world where many people are settling economic activity using the price inferred by a UTXOracle model, there will be many additional UTXOs settled in round USD values. These UTXOs may diminish the model’s accuracy or distort it in other ways similar to how a large-language model (LLM) trained on LLM-generated content will not match the effectiveness of one trained on human-generated content.</p><h2>Using A UTXOracle Model In Practice</h2><p>Love it or hate it, you know the word “Ordinal.” Ordinals taught me that people can coalesce around a methodology of interpreting the UTXO set that is <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/clearing-up-a-fallacy-about-bitcoin-ordinal-inscriptions">technically external to Bitcoin</a>, but which can be solidified at the social layer as an additional protocol on top of Bitcoin.</p><p>It is my hope that a sufficiently-accurate UTXOracle model will be produced by someone which will allow people to use that version of the model as a schelling point in building decentralized applications on Bitcoin.</p><p>It is my further hope that Bitcoiners can develop a method of using these one or more competing models in a trust-minimized way to expand how Bitcoin is able to bring financial peace to the world.</p><p>A successful implementation would be one in which:</p><ul><li>Model inputs are publicly known and outcomes are verifiable</li><li>DLC participants can contest fraudulent outcomes by calculating their own price using the model inputs. (An elegant solution to this issue remains an unsolved challenge.)</li></ul><p>And one in which any of these security models is possible: </p><ul><li>Peer to peer: Two or more ordinary participants can utilize the UTXOracle model without third parties</li><li>Verifiable, centralized oracle attestations: A centralized oracle signs a message with a particular UTXOracle pricing model that the oracle will use and participants are able to verify outcomes and punish wrongdoing</li><li>UTXOracle as a quorum member: Use the UTXOracle price as a logic check in a traditional, centralized oracle model or in a two-of-three or three-of-five multi-oracle setup</li></ul><h2>UTXOracle Use Cases</h2><h3>DLC Derivatives (Options, Futures, Perpetual Futures)</h3><p>This would enable users to buy or sell contracts in an open marketplace where outcomes are administered by participants using a UTXOracle price.</p><p>For example: Alice deposits an amount of bitcoin to a DLC-governed address. Bob pays Alice an amount of bitcoin denominated in USD (as evidenced by the UTXOracle price). At the time of settlement, Alice or Bob may produce a signature from an oracle attesting to the price calculated under the UTXOracle model to determine the settlement flow of funds as expired or exercised.</p><h3>On-Chain Lending Markets</h3><p>Users can borrow or lend in an open marketplace where the loan life cycle is administered by participants using a UTXOracle price.</p><p>For example: I have 1 BTC (at a $100,000 value) and want to take a partial loan of $30,000 without selling my bitcoin. I can coordinate with a market-maker to deposit my 1 BTC and the market maker’s 0.3 BTC (at a value of $30,000) to an address governed by a DLC. Upon funding, I may spend the 0.3 BTC for my desired use case.</p><h3>Normal Loan Repayment</h3><p>In this use case, the borrower has the option to sign a transaction granting the market maker $30,000 in value of the original 1 BTC or to deposit $30,000 in value (as evidenced by the UTXOracle price) and withdraw the original 1 BTC.</p><p>Upon liquidation, if the value of the 1 BTC in the DLC-governed address falls to somewhere near $30,000 (as evidenced by the UTXOracle price), the market maker can sweep out the entire 1 BTC to liquidate the loan and recoup their principal.</p><h3>StableSats </h3><p>The UTXOracle model also offers an interesting use case around “stablesats,” referring to bitcoin-backed USD stablecoins or stable-value USD accounts denominated in bitcoin on Lightning.</p><p>For instance, imagine that you want to hold $1,000 worth of bitcoin for the next month. You do not want to or cannot hold the $1,000 in cash, at a bank, in Ethereum- or Tron-based stablecoins or on an exchange. You could enter into an agreement with a market maker on the Lightning Network to stream the daily net price change in value to you. You would be able to independently validate that the correct amounts are being paid by using the UTXOracle model you agreed to. At the end of the month you will have a different amount of bitcoin in your Lightning channel, but it will be worth $1,000.</p><h3>Peer-To-Peer Marketplaces</h3><p>As a seller in an online marketplace, it’s currently difficult to price items in bitcoin due to the volatility as well as the fact that your expenses are likely in USD. But accepting payments in USD means accepting chargeback risk, fraud and the fees and complexity inherent in modern payment systems. Pricing products in USD, but having the flexibility to accept a USD value in bitcoin via the UTXOracle model, could encourage more bitcoin-denominated commerce.</p><h2>The Next Steps For UTXOracle</h2><p>As outlined in this article, I believe the UTXOracle model could be a powerful tool in advancing Bitcoin use cases and extending financial freedom to more of the world. While it has trade-offs, I believe it represents an exciting frontier that can improve upon existing solutions that require more trust in third parties.</p><p>If you are excited about the prospect of UTXOracle, I encourage you to join the discussion on <a href="https://t.me/+qJA8nOuhtUVkN2Ux">Telegram</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/UTXOracle">Twitter</a>.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Daniel Hinton and Steve Jeffress.

These significant investors may not yet see the <a href="https://www.bitcoms.xyz/bitcoin-is/bitcoin-is-human-rights">liberating</a>, world-improving, <a href="https://www.bitcoms.xyz/bitcoin-is/bitcoin-is-bloody-hard">hard-money</a> aspects of the technology that I see, but they are likely to have an impact on bitcoin as a <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/store-of-value">store of value</a> all the same. </p><p>And, if anything, I believe the probable price effect of significant amounts of capital being attracted to bitcoin is underestimated by most Bitcoiners. It’s now common to describe bitcoin’s potential value ceiling as “<a href="https://twitter.com/knutsvanholm?lang=en">everything divided by 21 million</a>” — a reference to all stored value divided by the total possible supply of bitcoin. But, in my view, a reasonable heuristic for predicting bitcoin’s price is “everything divided by 7 million” (where “everything” is the total reallocated of capital to bitcoin, however high that may be). This means, for example, that bitcoin could hit $1 million with only one-third of the redirected capital commonly thought to be needed.</p><p>To show why this is a more helpful yardstick, I’ll expand on some existing ways of estimating newly-allocated capital’s effect on bitcoin’s price, adjusting the results for what I see as three critical but neglected factors.</p><h2>Existing Tools For Predicting Bitcoin’s Price </h2><p>For an initial bitcoin price projection, we’ll use two existing tools, both born of deep research and thorough analysis: a framework proposed by Onramp COO <a href="https://twitter.com/Croesus_BTC?s=20">Jesse Myers (also known as Croesus)</a> and a model produced by Swan CIO <a href="https://twitter.com/alphaazeta">Alpha Zeta</a>. </p><p>For our example scenario, we’ll presume $20 trillion of investment capital flowing out of traditional assets and into bitcoin (the specific amount isn’t too important, as we’ll flex the numbers up and down later). For the sake of simplicity and comparability, our example scenario is timeframe agnostic (so, all figures are in today’s dollars).</p><p><a href="https://www.onceinaspecies.com/p/bitcoins-full-potential-valuation">Myers’ framework</a>, published earlier this year, posits a maximum potential bitcoin market capitalization of $200 trillion, estimated by capturing that amount from his own $900 trillion estimate of the total of existing store-of-value assets and assuming bitcoin will capture some percentage of each category.</p><figure>

        <figcaption><a href="https://www.onceinaspecies.com/p/bitcoins-full-potential-valuation"><em>Source</em></a></figcaption>
    </figure><p>As indicated in the bottom right of the above table, the framework suggests a maximum potential bitcoin capture of $200 trillion, leading to an approximate bitcoin price of $10 million ($200 trillion divided by <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-happens-when-all-bitcoin-are-mined/">about 20 million</a> equals about $10 million per BTC.)</p><p>In his commentary, Myers suggests that “you can run your own numbers here for the ‘Bitcoin capture’ column and see what you come up with.” So, if we scale everything down by an order of magnitude for our more modest bitcoin capture of $20 trillion (roughly 2.2% of Myers’ $900 trillion “total addressable market”), the same arithmetic gives us an expected price of about $1 million per BTC.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://nakamotoportfolio.com/apps/shrodinger">Alpha Zeta’s model</a> is a sophisticated, interactive tool with a configurable set of input parameters, which (with apologies to its author) I crudely manipulated to approximate the values we used with Myers’ framework. Because the tool allows only for round percentages, I modeled Bitcoin’s asset capture at only 2% (not the roughly 2.2% used with Myers’ model) of $900 trillion. This results in exactly what I would have expected: a similar, but slightly lower, BTC price projection of around $900,000 per coin.</p><figure>

        <figcaption><a href="https://nakamotoportfolio.com/apps/shrodinger"><em>Source</em></a></figcaption>
    </figure><p>For the sake of dealing with round numbers, let’s say that in capturing about $20 trillion in global investment capital, both tools would suggest an expected bitcoin dollar price of about $1 million. These tools are not only logical, but also consistent with each other. So, what might they miss? </p><h2>Overlooked Factor One: Lost Bitcoin</h2><p>Both tools seem to base their price predictions on a reallocated dollar value divided by a rough total number of bitcoin in issue (<a href="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/how-many-bitcoins-are-there/">about 20 million</a>). However, this ignores the fact that some issued bitcoins are unavailable. </p><p>First, consider lost coins. The number of bitcoin that have been lost is impossible to quantify with precision, but it has been estimated at nearly 4 million in a <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/bitcoin-market-data-exchanges-trading/">2020 report by Chainalysis</a>. Cane Island Digital’s 2020 report “<a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d580747908cdc0001e6792d/t/5e98dde5558a587a09fac0cc/1587076583519/research+note+4.17.pdf">There Will Never Be More Than 14 Million Bitcoins</a>” suggests a higher number of about 5.4 million lost coins. I sought a third opinion from leading on-chain analyst <a href="https://twitter.com/_Checkmatey_?s=20">Checkmate</a> for this article, who kindly shared an initial estimate of “around 3.942 million BTC.” </p><p>Using an average of these three data points, we can justifiably posit that, of the 19.4 million bitcoin issued to date, around 4.4 million are lost, leaving 15 million accessible by their owners. This is significantly less than the roughly 20 million typically used in bitcoin pricing models.</p><h2>Overlooked Factor Two: Hardcore HODLers</h2><p>Second, consider what proportion of this accessible 15 million bitcoin might never be sold for <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/fiat-money">fiat</a>. The apparent existence of “hardcore HODLers” — true believers who are <a href="https://twitter.com/mitchellhodl/status/1676724929381691395?s=46&t=qlLh5EINT6HUkjNdlRmv1g">unwilling to sell at any price</a> — means that the general aphorism that “everyone has their price” may not necessarily apply to Bitcoin. </p><p>Potentially-useful research on this overlooked factor is a <a href="https://insights.glassnode.com/bitcoin-liquid-supply/">Glassnode report from 2020</a>, which concluded that “14.5 million BTC can be classified as being illiquid.” This was built upon by <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/the-hodl-model">Rational Root in his 2023 “HODL Model,”</a> which hypothesizes that by “2024, the illiquid supply… will be… 14.3 million bitcoin.” Subtracting our earlier estimate of 4.4 million lost coins from this total illiquid supply figure (which includes lost bitcoin), these sources suggest that about 10 million of the roughly 15 million accessible bitcoin are in this “illiquid” category, i.e., their HODLers are unwilling to sell. </p><p>But quantifying how many of those 10 million illiquid coins will be “hardcore HODL’d” by the diamond handed in the face of unprecedented bitcoin value appreciation is really beyond the limits of analysis and firmly in the realms of conjecture. It seems perfectly rational to me to expect many existing HODLers to part with at least a portion of their stack if the fiat price rises to new all-time highs. Recognizing that any “guesstimate” is more sensible than ignoring this phenomenon altogether, I’m going to suppose just half of those 10 million illiquid bitcoin will be “hardcore HODL’d” as the price goes up. </p><h3>The Price Effect Of Unavailable Coins</h3><p>So, once we’ve allowed for 4.4 million lost and 5 million “hardcore HODL’d” bitcoin, that leaves around 10 million coins available for the $20 trillion of captured value in our example scenario. $20 trillion divided by 10 million gives us a $2 million mean price paid per BTC.</p><p>That mean of $2 million is double the valuation tools’ unadjusted price estimate of $1 million. So, for me, at this point a reasonable heuristic for gauging the mean bitcoin price is: “everything divided by 10 million” (where “everything” is the total fiat newly allocated to bitcoin, however much that may be).</p><h2>Overlooked Factor Three: Volatility </h2><p>But $2 million is the <em>mean</em> price in our example scenario, and the price at any given time during bitcoin’s absorption of the $20 trillion could be significantly higher or lower. So, we also need to predict the range within which the price might move. </p><p>Using history as a guide, we see that the dollar-BTC price has become less volatile as bitcoin has grown up from toddler to a teenager, with the <a href="https://twitter.com/bitcoms/status/1621160354444374016?s=20">ratio of the major USD price tops to subsequent bottoms</a> shrinking as follows:</p><div>  </div><p>Presuming that this trend toward lower volatility continues, over the next few years we might plausibly expect a high-to-low ratio of around three. Against our example scenario’s longer-term moving average price of $2 million, that might translate to short-term lows of about $1 million and short-lived highs of about $3 million. </p><p>That high of $3 million is triple the valuation tools’ unadjusted price estimate of $1 million. So, for me, a reasonable current heuristic for gauging the <em>maximum</em> price is: “everything divided by 7 million” (where “everything” is the total fiat newly allocated to bitcoin, however much that may be).</p><h2>Scaling The Example Scenario</h2><p>Next, we’ll adjust the amount of new capital being reallocated to bitcoin to create alternative scenarios, as follows:</p><div>  </div><p>Based on this, for bitcoin’s price to hit $1 million, rather than requiring the roughly $20 trillion reallocation of global investment capital suggested by the raw tools, only around one third of that amount would be needed.</p><p>Although modest-sounding in the context of global wealth, such a reallocation would nonetheless involve significant participation by large, slow-moving and conservative pools of capital. In my view, while this is possible over the medium- or long term, this seems improbable within the next few years without seismic disruption in financial markets (such as a major sovereign debt crisis, banking system collapse or persistently vertiginous inflation) accelerating the necessary paradigm shift away from “fiat thinking.” </p><p>In the absence of such an event within that time, I see something like the first and most modest scenario in the table as more probable, with temporary highs in the low hundreds of thousands of dollars as “big capital” slowly reallocates to bitcoin. </p><p>You may of course have <a href="https://twitter.com/Excellion/status/1679692984793829379?s=20">your own opinion</a> on an appropriate heuristic. But, having considered the role of volatility and accounted for unavailable bitcoin (both lost and “hardcore HODL’d”), I think “everything divided by 7 million” is a reasonable gauge for the likely peak price impact of capital redirected to bitcoin. While “everything” here is the total of that capital — which could theoretically be as much as all the stored value in the world — any credible guess at a future price needs to be based on a realistic level of reallocation to bitcoin.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Bitcoms.

ETFs can be bought and sold on stock exchanges and brokerage accounts, with the custody of the underlying asset being held by the manager of the ETF. This allows for investors to get price exposure to bitcoin without having to worry about self-custody or figuring out how to use a bitcoin exchange. This would potentially give traditional investors peace of mind since they could purchase shares of a spot bitcoin ETF directly through their familiar brokerage accounts.</p><p>There are many types of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-a-bitcoin-etf">Bitcoin ETFs</a> available<strong>.</strong> The futures ETFs have had most success in being approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) thus far, but these track futures contracts for the expected price of bitcoin at a later date. The contracts do not convey bitcoin ownership and the contracts must be settled or traded for new contracts as they approach expiration. </p><p>There are many proponents for a spot bitcoin ETF and numerous applications have been made and denied in the past. Reasons from the SEC included, not providing enough protection for investors and the public interest. While the SEC has not yet approved any spot bitcoin ETF applications, there are numerous bitcoin trusts that are currently on the market.</p><h2>What Is The Difference Between A Bitcoin Trust And A Spot ETF?</h2><p>Both ETFs and trusts offer exposure to Bitcoin without requiring investors to custody the Bitcoin, but they do so with different structures, pricing mechanisms, and levels of regulatory oversight.</p><h3>Bitcoin Trust</h3><p>A bitcoin trust is a private, closed-end fund that is invested exclusively in bitcoin. The trust's shares are not redeemable, meaning they can't be exchanged for the underlying bitcoin. The trust's price can therefore deviate quite substantially from the value of the underlying asset it represents. The most notable examples of bitcoin trusts are <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/microstrategy">MicroStrategy</a> Bitcoin Trust (MSTR) and the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/grayscale-bitcoin-trust">Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC)</a>. Shares of a trust often trade at a premium or discount to the net asset value (NAV) of the underlying bitcoin. This is because the supply of trust shares is fixed and can't be increased or decreased in response to market demand. Trusts like GBTC operate under the SEC's Rule 144, which allows the public quotation of privately placed securities after a holding period. It's not subject to the same regulatory oversight as ETFs.</p><h3>Spot Bitcoin ETF</h3><p>A Spot Bitcoin ETF is an open-end fund that can issue or redeem shares based on demand. It's designed to closely track the spot price of Bitcoin. An ETF is traded on major exchanges, similar to stocks, and can be bought and sold throughout the trading day at prices that are in line with the underlying asset. ETFs allow for the creation and redemption of shares to meet demand. If the price of the ETF diverges from the underlying asset's value, authorized participants can take advantage of arbitrage opportunities. This mechanism helps to keep the ETF price in line with the NAV of the underlying asset. ETFs are regulated investment products under the Investment Company Act of 1940, providing a higher level of regulatory oversight and consumer protection.</p><h2>History Of Spot Bitcoin ETF Applications</h2><p>The idea of a spot bitcoin ETF has been in the works for several years.

Their application included a new provision for surveillance-sharing agreements that would theoretically allow the company to detect fraud and manipulation in the bitcoin market.</p><p>BlackRock has a nearly perfect record of getting their ETF applications approved. Out of 576 applications, only 1 has been denied. This historical approval rate led a slew of other companies that had previously had their applications denied to refile in earnest.</p><p>Below are the filing details and deadlines for the eight companies who have pending applications with the SEC.</p><div>  </div><h2>Why Has It Taken So Long For A Bitcoin Spot ETF Approval?</h2><p>Spot bitcoin ETF applications have been denied by the SEC multiple times and from many different issuers. In the past, the SEC claimed that the reason applications were denied was because the issuer didn’t include a “surveillance-sharing agreement with a regulated market of significant size related to bitcoin.” The stated reason for agreement is in order to prevent market manipulation. The SEC <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/nysearca/2018/34-83904.pdf">claims</a> these types of surveillance-sharing agreements allow for a thorough investigation should some type of market manipulation occur.</p><p>The recent onslaught of applications have come on the heels of BlackRock filing for the iShares Bitcoin Trust, which included a new provision for surveillance-sharing agreements. This new filing, paired with BlackRock’s near perfect record of ETF approvals, makes it seem like a favorable ruling is likely.</p><h2>When Can We Expect The First Spot Bitcoin ETF To Go Live?</h2><p>There is a promising timeline for when a spot bitcoin ETF might get approved. In the table above, there are specific deadlines by when the SEC must respond to each filing. ARK 21 Shares Bitcoin ETF was the first to recently file and the final decision deadline is January 10, 2024, but it’s possible that the SEC will make a decision at one of the earlier deadlines.</p><p>Additionally, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have <a href="https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1686707919696568320?s=20">increased their estimates</a> for the approval and launch of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. this year to a 65% probability, up from their previous estimate of 50%.</p><h2>The Potential Impact Of An Approved Spot Bitcoin ETF</h2><p>The net effect of a Bitcoin ETF on Bitcoin is complex and can depend on a variety of factors, including regulatory decisions, investor behavior, as well as the dynamics of the broader cryptocurrency and traditional financial markets.</p><p>Many investors wonder how a spot bitcoin ETF will affect the market, bitcoin price, liquidity, adoption and demand. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust is similar in structure to SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), the largest gold ETF by asset under management. Started in 2004, the <a href="https://www.spdrgoldshares.com/usa/historical-data/">ETF had over $1 billion in total asset value</a> in the first few days and then hit $50 billion by 2010.</p><p>GLD is just one of a few large gold ETFs on the market. Total gold ETF products are estimated to have $220 billion in AUM. It’s not easy to separate the impact of a widely adopted gold ETF on gold’s price, but it’s clear that the ETFs, even accounting for only a small amount of gold supply, have had a significant impact on the market. The GLD ETF was a major shift in how investors could purchase gold and opened up gold buying to the masses while increasing gold market volumes and overall liquidity. The GLD ETF was a catalyst for a 350% rise over six years. Bitcoin could go through a similar shift once there is more regulatory clarity through the approval of a spot bitcoin ETF.</p><h2>Is A Spot ETF Good For Bitcoin?</h2><p>Many investors have been waiting on the sidelines for government agencies to provide regulatory clarity. It is likely that a spot bitcoin ETF approval will give investors confidence that bitcoin is a legitimate asset worth investing in. There are many benefits of a spot bitcoin ETF, but there are also some drawbacks.</p><h3>Potential Benefits</h3><ul><li><strong>Market Legitimization:</strong> A spot Bitcoin ETF would help to further legitimize Bitcoin as a recognized asset class. This could increase its acceptance among traditional investors and financial institutions.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Increased Liquidity:</strong> By opening up Bitcoin investment to a wider range of investors, a spot Bitcoin ETF could increase the liquidity of the Bitcoin market. This could reduce volatility and make price movements more predictable.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Price Appreciation:</strong> The creation of a Bitcoin ETF could potentially lead to increased demand for Bitcoin, as the ETF provider would need to purchase actual Bitcoin to back the ETF shares. This could potentially drive up the price of Bitcoin.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Transparency and Security:</strong> ETFs are subject to regulatory oversight which requires transparency and standardized reporting. This can provide more security and certainty to investors who might otherwise be wary of investing directly in Bitcoin.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Ease of Access:</strong> A Bitcoin ETF allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without having to buy it and manage a digital wallet directly. This significantly lowers the barriers to entry for institutional and less tech-savvy investors.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Regulated Exposure:</strong> Since ETFs are regulated financial products, investing in a Bitcoin ETF provides exposure to the cryptocurrency market in a way that is compliant with securities laws, potentially reducing the risk of fraud or theft.</li></ul><h3>Potential Downsides Or Risks</h3><ul><li><strong>Market Manipulation:</strong> There are concerns that large holders of Bitcoin could potentially manipulate the price of Bitcoin to impact the value of the ETF, although this risk exists in the direct Bitcoin market as well.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Regulatory Risks:</strong> The existence of a Bitcoin ETF would tie the Bitcoin market more closely to regulatory decisions. Negative regulatory actions or policies could adversely impact the value of the ETF and, by extension, Bitcoin's price.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Investment Displacement:</strong> Some investors may choose to invest in the ETF instead of buying Bitcoin directly, which could impact the dynamics of the direct Bitcoin market. </li></ul><ul><li><strong>Fees:</strong> ETFs come with management fees, which can eat into your returns over time. Direct ownership of Bitcoin does not have this issue, beyond transaction fees and potential costs for secure storage.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Potential for Mispricing:</strong> While the aim of a Bitcoin ETF is to track the price of Bitcoin, in reality, the price of the ETF could diverge from the price of Bitcoin due to market forces. This can lead to situations where the ETF is overpriced or underpriced relative to the underlying asset.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Lack of Ownership:</strong> When you buy a Bitcoin ETF, you don't actually own the underlying Bitcoin. This means you won't be able to use Bitcoin for transactions, and you don't have the potential benefits of owning a decentralized digital asset.</li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Bitcoin held in self-custody is a revolutionary tool for financial freedom. That being said, a spot bitcoin ETF offers a regulated and accessible way for investors to gain exposure to bitcoin without having to navigate unfamiliar cryptocurrency exchanges or learn the complexities and security of self-custody. Additionally, some investors can only hold bitcoin via regulated financial offerings, like an ETF. In summary, this type of investment vehicle is inevitable for an asset that is gaining institutional adoption.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwMjQxMDY4MDAyODQ2MDM4/bitcoin-spot-etf-sec.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Whistleblower Edward Snowden to Headline the Bitcoin Amsterdam Conference]]></title><description><![CDATA[The cybersecurity expert is set to share his insights on the intersection of digital currency, privacy, and the future of financial freedom.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/industry-events/whistleblower-edward-snowden-to-headline-the-bitcoin-amsterdam-conference</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/industry-events/whistleblower-edward-snowden-to-headline-the-bitcoin-amsterdam-conference</guid><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Edward Snowden]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin Amsterdam]]></category><category><![CDATA[Conference]]></category><category><![CDATA[Industry Events]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Nik Hoffman]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 04 Aug 2023 16:12:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk5ODQ0NjEwODUwMTY5OTU5/jdh-20221012-bitcoin-amsterdam-163_foto-jelmer-de-haas_highres_adobergb-1.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://b.tc/conference/amsterdam">Bitcoin Amsterdam Conference</a> is thrilled to welcome renowned whistleblower and cybersecurity expert,&nbsp;Edward Snowden, to its landmark event, where he will share his insights on the intersection of digital currency, privacy, and the future of financial freedom during a 45 minute long online talk with a Q&A session.&nbsp;</p><p>The event will take place in Westergas, Amsterdam on October 12-13, 2023 and will bring together industry leaders, enthusiasts, and experts to discuss the future of bitcoin, decentralization and freedom.<br><br></p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/TheBitcoinConf/status/1687439337149902849"></a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>“In 2013, Ed Snowden alerted the American people to the fact that the US Government was knowingly conducting warrantless surveillance of its own citizens; a violation of basic rights. It was a watershed moment both for government overreach, as well as for the ability of individual freedom fighters and cypherpunks to push back. As Snowden announced to the world at Bitcoin 2019, Bitcoin was a key tool in his efforts to expose the ongoing surveillance,” said Brandon Green, Head of Events for BTC Inc. “10 years after his initial action, Snowden will talk to our community at Bitcoin Amsterdam about the ongoing fight to protect privacy for individuals, not just in the US, but around the world, and especially right here in Europe. And he will discuss the importance of Bitcoin in that fight,” continued Green.</p><p>As a prominent advocate for cybersecurity and freedom, Edward Snowden has long expressed his support for Bitcoin, stating&nbsp;"Bitcoin is free money... When I think about liberty, that’s what this is all about. It’s freedom from permission."&nbsp;</p><p>He views it as an essential tool for preserving financial privacy and protecting individuals from surveillance and censorship. Snowden's endorsement of Bitcoin aligns with its core principles of decentralization, transparency, and financial sovereignty, making his appearance at the Bitcoin Amsterdam Conference highly anticipated.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk5ODQ0NjEwODUwMTY5OTU5/jdh-20221012-bitcoin-amsterdam-163_foto-jelmer-de-haas_highres_adobergb-1.jpg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[In The Absence Of International Support, Myanmar’s Exiled Government Should Explore A Bitcoin Bond]]></title><description><![CDATA[Myanmar’s exiled National Unity Government is struggling to secure international support, making the case for a bitcoin-focused bond offering.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/myanmars-exiled-government-needs-a-bitcoin-bond-strategy</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/myanmars-exiled-government-needs-a-bitcoin-bond-strategy</guid><category><![CDATA[Democracy]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Southeast Asia]]></category><category><![CDATA[War]]></category><category><![CDATA[Human rights]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bonds]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin Bond]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Win Ko Ko Aung]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 04 Aug 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg3OTIyNzgyMzYzODUzODc1/bitcoin-portfolio-insurance-introductions-basics-and-bond-math.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Win Ko Ko Aung, a McCourt Scholar for Georgetown University’s Data Science for Public Policy program and a survivor of Myanmar’s 2021 military coup.</em></p><p>The Biden administration <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/02/11/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-actions-in-response-to-the-coup-in-burma/">responded</a> to the 2021 military coup in <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/how-bitcoin-can-save-political-dissidents-in-myanmar">Myanmar</a> (also known as Burma) with rapid implementation of economic sanctions, a significant measure that involved freezing $1 billion in funds held by the Myanmar government within the United States.</p><p>More than two years after the beginning of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar_protests_(2021%E2%80%93present)">Myanmar's Spring Revolution</a>, which was born out of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Myanmar_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat">violent overthrow of the civilian-elected government by the Myanmar military</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Unity_Government_of_Myanmar">National Unity Government</a> (NUG) — <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2021/04/myanmar-coup-opponents-announce-national-unity-government/">largely formed</a> with elected officials from the 2020 Myanmar Election, representatives from ethnic organizations and anti-coup activists who have successfully escaped arrest attempts by the military — <a href="https://theworld.org/stories/2022-03-15/myanmar-revolutionaries-seek-1-billion-frozen-us">continues to seek avenues to access these frozen funds in order to accelerate the revolution effort</a>. </p><p>And access to these funds appear to be desperately needed. In Myanmar, the aftermath of the 2021 overthrow has created a devastating situation. The military only had <a href="https://specialadvisorycouncil.org/2022/09/statement-briefing-effective-control-myanmar/">stable control of 17% of the territory</a> of Myanmar and the rest of the country remains a battleground, with distressing attacks like an <a href="https://apnews.com/article/airstrikes-military-myanmar-village-918fd636bb81153928ab7481e06423e5">April airstrike that killed 100 villagers</a>. <a href="https://aappb.org/">More than 3,500 people have been killed and over 23,000 civilians imprisoned since the coup</a>, highlighting the urgent need for humanitarian aid. </p><p>The United Nations <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/unicef-myanmar-humanitarian-situation-report-no-4-1-may-30-june-2023">estimates</a> that 17.6 million people in Myanmar require assistance, a number equivalent to the <a href="https://reports.unocha.org/en/country/ukraine/">population in need in Ukraine</a>. But the United Nations’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) response plan <a href="https://humanitarianaction.info/?bs=eyJibG9jay1hOGM1Y2MyNi00ZGZmLTQ5ZmUtYTk1Mi0zYjVkMmUyYzgzYTciOnsic29ydCI6eyJjb2x1bW4iOjIsImRpciI6ImFzYyJ9LCJzZWFyY2giOiIifX0%3D">reveals</a> a significant disparity in funding for Myanmar compared to other countries facing issues of similar or lesser magnitudes.

    </figure><p>This underfunding highlights, on a global-policy level, the international community’s reluctance to provide substantial support for the Myanmar conflict. And this lack of assistance has had a profound impact on the people of Myanmar, who are struggling with the ongoing crisis. </p><p>In a recent <a href="https://www.usip.org/publications/2023/06/ukraine-myanmar-deserves-international-aid">analysis article</a> from the United States Institute Of Peace, a group of Myanmar's prominent figures stressed the shared courage, spirit and unity of the country’s people with Ukrainians in their fight for democracy. However, they also highlighted a significant disparity in the level of international assistance received by the two countries. While Ukraine has received substantial aid to counter Russian aggression, Myanmar's struggle for democracy has not received comparable support. The authors pointed out that even a fraction of the aid received by Ukraine could have a profound impact on Myanmar's efforts to unseat the military dictators and potentially shorten the duration of the conflict.</p><p>Furthermore, as Myanmar’s shadow government, NUG, faces another significant drawback on the international diplomatic frontline. Despite controlling <a href="https://asiatimes.com/2022/09/time-for-us-eu-to-recognize-myanmars-nug/">53% of Myanmar's territory</a> and <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2023/02/myanmars-national-unity-government-opens-office-in-washington/">opening the liaison office</a> in Washington D.C. under the <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/what-burma-act-does-and-doesnt-mean-us-policy-myanmar">BURMA Act</a>, the NUG is struggling to gain legitimacy and recognition from the United States. While the European Parliament has <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/RC-9-2021-0502_EN.pdf">adopted a resolution</a> "supporting" the NUG as the "legitimate representatives of the democratic wishes of the people of Myanmar" since October 2021, the struggle for similar recognition in the U.S. continues.</p><h2>Funding Myanmar’s Struggle For Democracy</h2><p>During this challenging period, and as it attempts to access funds frozen by the U.S., the NUG has explored alternative funding avenues. For instance, it has successfully raised millions of dollars from Myanmar nationals across the globe through creative approaches. The NUG’s <a href="https://mopfi.nugmyanmar.org/">ministry of planning, finance and investment</a> (MOPFI) initiated <a href="https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/burma/nug-raises-over-us9-million-selling-land-illegally-seized-by-myanmar-military.html">virtual land sales</a>, generating a remarkable $9 million in just two-and-a-half days. Additionally, the auction sale of <a href="https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/burma/sale-of-myanmar-coup-leaders-mansion-raises-us2-million-in-three-days.html.">the military dictator's land bonds</a> garnered $2 million within a span of three days.</p><p>As of early 2023, the NUG announced that it had accumulated <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/myanmar-shadow-government-raises-131m-to-oppose-junta">over $132 million</a> to support its efforts in undermining the military junta. Even more impressive is that this amount was primarily raised within the country of <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?locations=MM">54 million people</a>, where the GDP per capita stands at a <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD">relatively-low</a> <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?locations=MM">$1,095</a>, as well as only about <a href="https://myanmar.unfpa.org/en/news/census-report-425-million-people-born-myanmar-now-live-abroad">4.5 million people from Myanmar</a> who now live abroad. </p><p>The NUG’s minister for planning, finance and investment, <a href="https://mopfi.nugmyanmar.org/union-minister/">Tin Tun Naing</a>, told <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/myanmar-shadow-government-raises-131m-to-oppose-junta">The Straits Times</a> that approximately 45% of the funds raised to date have been from the sale of so-called <a href="https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/burma/myanmar-civilian-govts-bond-sale-raises-over-6-million-in-under-12-hours.html">Spring Revolution special treasury bonds</a>.</p><p>In addition to the recent establishment of an <a href="https://www.facebook.com/theirrawaddy/posts/pfbid0313tyBZL7WG2CkGJXe5KVs4qrcjxbJxUDQFH7jz6R1nfGgd9qb5prmRtnQz2TePq5l">interim central bank</a> by the NUG, this shadow government is also exploring natively-digital financial solutions to its problems. The recent soft-launch of the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/myanmar-shadow-government-backs-crypto-bank-launch">Spring Development Bank</a>, which is backed by the Polygon blockchain, is such a step. According to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SpringDevBank/videos/297226682833233">an announcement event</a> held in the Burmese language, attended by Minister Tin Tun Naing, the Spring Development Bank has received licensing and regulation from the interim central bank and is meant to enable transactions in four currencies: Myanmar kyats, United States dollars, Singapore dollars and Thai baht.</p><p>During a question and answer session at the announcement event, Tin Tun Naing noted that the NUG has a plan to channel international funding through the Spring Development Bank. He also mentioned that it is actively working toward recovering Myanmar's $1 billion reserve frozen by the U.S. through legal means. He emphasized that he expects significant progress in this regard as the revolution gains clearer momentum.</p><p>While the NUG’s initial success in securing funding on its own is promising, it also demonstrates a hard reality: Myanmar's struggle for democracy is being carried forward primarily by its own people, as the international community and aid donors <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/02/03/myanmar-junta-coup-anniversary-ukraine/">have largely ignored the country’s struggles</a>. And it demonstrates a need to embrace one of the world’s preeminent, sovereign financial tools in Bitcoin.</p><h2>Myanmar Should Issue A Bitcoin Bond</h2><p>Given the challenging circumstances and limited international support, the NUG should draw inspiration from initiatives like the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/el-salvador-bitcoin-news/el-salvadors-assembly-approves-bitcoin-bonds-bill">Bitcoin bond introduced in El Salvador</a>. The NUG could issue a digital "freedom bond" that can tap into a global pool of ideologically-aligned investors who want to support democracy in Myanmar. The innovative freedom bond approach could involve denominating a certain percentage of the frozen $1 billion reserve in the United States into bitcoin, while keeping the bonds denominated in USD. Additionally, the freedom bond could be designed with specific features, such as a predetermined interest rate and a lock period, to attract investors and provide them with incentives to support Myanmar's struggle for democracy.</p><p>Furthermore, the NUG may explore the possibility of offering permanent residence status in the post-revolution era as an added benefit to potential investors. By combining these elements in the freedom bond strategy, the NUG could create an innovative and compelling investment opportunity that not only helps fund the democratization efforts but also provides investors with tangible bitcoin standard benefits and a sense of contribution to a meaningful cause. This strategic move could mark a defining moment for Myanmar's journey toward democratic progress on the global stage, and overcome its significant diplomatic isolation. </p><p>After multiple attempts to contact the Tin Tun Naing for comment on this potential bitcoin standard, the NUG team has indicated that its central bank setup is currently its top priority. Once the establishment of the central bank is completed, however, it plans to explore establishing a bitcoin standard.</p><p>“Bitcoin in Myanmar is like the early internet era (2007-2008) in the country when the military junta <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Than_Shwe">Than Shwe</a> ruled,” explained a representative from the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Bitcoin.MM.Initiative">Bitcoin Myanmar Initiative</a>, a Burmese language educational platform, in response to questions for this article. “They brainwashed parents and teachers into believing the internet was just a dating place for teenagers and view(ing) adult content, and internet cafes were places where kids learned to smoke cigarettes. However, the brainwashing of the early internet era turned out to be false. Rather, it was a fear-based counter narrative to discourage the populace from embracing technology that would lead to a democratic information and open to the free world experience.” </p><p>The initiative believes that Myanmar is at a pivotal moment for Bitcoin adoption, comparable to the spread of the early internet over a decade ago. </p><p>"We think we are at the exact moment of Bitcoin adoption in Myanmar," the representative stated.</p><p>While the concept of a bitcoin standard may seem futuristic for Myanmar, it has already gained attention and support from notable figures elsewhere. Robert F.

The 2023 version of this annual music festival was <a href="https://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/glastonbury-2023-line-up-so-far/">peppered with sets from big name acts</a> — Elton John, Guns N’ Roses and Foo Fighters, to name a few — but the inevitable media focus on these tends to mislead those viewing it from the outside. Glastonbury is a phenomenon of vast scale; it could be described as 10 festivals wrapped into one. Nearly everyone who goes will tell you they’ve had a great time, but probably all for different reasons.</p><figure>

        <figcaption><em>Glastonbury 2023, a festival of vast scale. Source: author.</em></figcaption>
    </figure><p>So, what links Glastonbury with Bitcoin? Some cursory research and my own trips to the festival in recent years suggest that very few have ever made a link at all, barring <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/23/why-glastonbury-is-my-kind-of-pyramid-scheme">this typically-scathing Guardian effort from a couple of years back</a>. </p><p>Indeed, many probably see the two as polar opposites. Glastonbury is famously left wing — there remains the <a href="https://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/areas/left-field/">Left Field tent</a>, which houses talks and debates by activists and union members, led by the ever-present, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Bragg">“broadly leftist” Billy Bragg</a>. The pyramid stage field <a href="https://twitter.com/glastonbury/status/1672566950050820096">featured grass coloring this year to display the giant message</a>: “We Stand With The NHS” in support of the U.K.’s National Health Service. </p><p>Bitcoin, by contrast, is often characterized as a technology that appeals to the right wing. David Golumbia went about as far as it’s possible to go in his 2016 book “<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Politics-Bitcoin-Right-Wing-Extremism-Forerunners/dp/1517901804/">The Politics Of Bitcoin: Software As Right-Wing Extremism</a>.”</p><p>Secondly, the festival is environmentally conscious and has<a href="https://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/areas/the-green-fields/the-greenpeace-field-2/"> long supported Greenpeace</a>. By contrast, Bitcoin is constantly criticized for its supposedly-wasteful energy use. Greenpeace’s U.S. arm has been responsible for its infamously poor “<a href="https://twitter.com/CleanUpBitcoin">change the code, not the climate</a>” campaign against Bitcoin, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/greenpeace-environment-attacks-help-bitcoin">funded to the tune of $5 million by Ripple’s Chris Larson</a>.</p><p>But are Glastonbury and Bitcoin really irreconcilable? Not at all. </p><p>Firstly, on the political front, Bitcoin itself is actually apolitical. It is a set of rules without rulers. Anyone who attempts to argue otherwise tends to mischaracterize it, and often relies on typecasting the average Bitcoiner as right wing. In response, I’d encourage readers to take a longer-term look at monetary history, and to ask the likes of Golumbia what it is about this open-source, universally-accessible, optional, non-coercive protocol that is so detestable. The smartest shortcut response to this hypothetical <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wpxDGrU_Ts&list=PLoB1eZWSVHVb3WdzYoq7zFwbd5_7Oeyp3&index=14">comes from Natalie Smolenski</a>: "Being an enemy of a technology is a fairly dumb way to waste your time because you're not in charge of whether a technology is adopted at any meaningful scale." </p><p>Moreover, those from the “progressive” end of the political spectrum are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/05/04/4-progressives-working-to-change-the-narrative-around-bitcoin/?sh=5ed000e13634">beginning to make their voices heard</a> and show that Bitcoin has universal appeal. Reminder: Bitcoin is for enemies.</p><p>Onto Bitcoin’s environmental impact. <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/bitcoin-energy/">As argued here</a> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/07/07/everything-you-need-to-know-about-bitcoin-and-the-environment/?sh=3250bcad46fc">and here</a>, all is not what it initially seems when evaluating Bitcoin’s ongoing energy use. In reality, Bitcoin is operating with ever-increasing efficiency and it drives behavioral change by lowering an individuals time preference, which can be a vital step in reducing the rampant and wasteful consumerism that we see in the world today.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>In summary, on both the political and environmental fronts, Bitcoin and Glastonbury are not the polar opposites that many would assume. There are commonalities, too. Both suit a libertarian outlook. Each has one-word brand recognition. Both would appear to sell themselves — Bitcoin, of course, has seen explosive growth with no formal marketing department, while Glastonbury tickets over the previous decade have <a href="https://www.glastofestfeed.com/news/statistics/how-fast-glastonbury-festival-tickets-sold-out-previous-years/">generally sold out in less than an hour and around eight months before the event is actually held</a>. Bitcoin has memes, <a href="https://thetab.com/uk/2023/06/26/glastonbury-flags-2023-worthy-farm-phillip-schofield-vaping-kendall-succession-314252">Glastonbury has memes on flags</a>.</p><p>So, how might Glastonbury embrace Bitcoin? </p><p>This past year, it was striking just how many payments were being made by card versus only a few years earlier, when cash reigned supreme. With many small merchants at the festival, it could hugely reduce fees of anywhere between <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/small-business/credit-card-processing-fees#:~:text=Credit%20card%20processing%20fees%20will,%243.50%20in%20credit%20card%20fees.">1.5% and 3.5%</a> currently levied on every purchase, by embracing Bitcoin’s Lightning Network as an added payment option. In the U.K., I’d suggest checking out the excellent work done by <a href="https://www.coincorner.com/">CoinCorner</a> and <a href="https://bridge2bitcoin.com/">Bridge2Bitcoin</a> in driving forward the Lightning Network as a low-cost payment mechanism for merchants.</p><p>In addition, bitcoin could represent a natural, long-term treasury reserve asset for Glastonbury — a long-term holding in bitcoin could help ride out any rough times in future. Indeed, the festival is no stranger to the pernicious nature of inflation: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glastonbury_Festival#Lineups">Ticket prices were £105 in 2003 and had increased to £335 in 2023</a>, which no doubt reflects the many increases in costs faced.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/rockshotmaga/status/1675077025441234946"></a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>Glastonbury have long been ahead of the curve in making sweeping changes ahead of others. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6251955.stm">In 2007</a>, it eliminated <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/may/15/shady-world-of-the-ticket-touts">ticket touts</a> and scalpers in one fell swoop by including festival goers’ photos on tickets. In 2019, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/27/glastonbury-festival-bans-plastic-bottles">it banned single-use plastic bottles entirely from the site</a>, and in 2023, <a href="https://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/information/getting-here/by-coach/">around 22,000 tickets were sold specifically for festival goers traveling by bus</a>. Might it also get ahead of the curve in embracing Bitcoin? </p><p>Admittedly, probably not, based on any current evidence. But I would say to Michael and Emily Eavis, the organizers of the event: Dig a little deeper than the current, skewed output on display from mainstream publications in the U.K. There is much more to Bitcoin than first meets the eye.</p><p>Michael Eavis confirmed in this year’s festival program that the local council <a href="https://www.somersetcountygazette.co.uk/news/23428464.glastonbury-festival-permanent-planning-permission-granted/">has now issued a license for them to hold the festival in perpetuity</a>. This must feel particularly sweet, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2001/jan/05/localgovernment.uknews">given his struggles with them over the years</a>. For Glastonbury, it seems, there will always be another year. And so too for Bitcoin. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by BitcoinActuary.

One such product that has gained significant attention is the Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF).</p><h2>What Is An ETF?</h2><p>ETFs are designed to track the performance of a particular index, commodity or asset class. This means that when you invest in an ETF, you are essentially buying a basket of securities or commodities that represent the underlying index or asset. For example, if you invest in an ETF that tracks the S&P 500 index, you will own a proportional share of the companies included in that index.</p><p>One of the key advantages of ETFs is their ability to be traded on a stock exchange throughout the day, just like individual stocks. This is in contrast to traditional mutual funds, which are bought and sold at the end of the trading day at the price determined by the asset’s net asset value (NAV). The ability to trade ETFs throughout the day provides investors with flexibility and the opportunity to react quickly to market movements.</p><p>ETFs have gained significant popularity among both individual and institutional investors due to their unique features and benefits. One of the main attractions of ETFs is their low costs. Compared to traditional mutual funds, ETFs generally have lower expense ratios, which means investors can keep more of their investment returns. Additionally, ETFs are known for their tax efficiency. Because of the way they are structured, ETFs typically generate fewer capital gains distributions compared to mutual funds, resulting in potential tax savings for investors.</p><p>Another advantage of ETFs is their flexibility. With ETFs, investors can easily buy or sell shares on the stock exchange, allowing for quick and efficient portfolio adjustments. This flexibility is particularly valuable for investors who want to implement specific investment strategies or make tactical asset allocation changes.</p><p>Furthermore, ETFs offer investors the opportunity to diversify their portfolios across different asset classes, sectors or regions. By investing in a single ETF, investors can gain exposure to a wide range of securities, reducing the risk associated with individual stocks or bonds. This diversification helps to spread risk and potentially enhance returns.</p><p>ETFs have revolutionized the investment landscape by providing investors with a cost-effective, tax-efficient and flexible way to gain exposure to various assets. Whether you are a seasoned investor looking to diversify your portfolio or a beginner seeking an entry point into the market, ETFs can be a valuable tool for achieving your investment goals.</p><h2>Types Of Bitcoin ETFs</h2><p>Bitcoin ETFs come in different forms. The two most common types are physically backed or spot ETFs and futures-based ETFs.</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/spot-bitcoin-etf">Bitcoin Spot ETFs</a></strong> hold bitcoin. This means that for every share of the ETF, there is a corresponding amount of bitcoin held in a secure custodian. Investors who hold shares of a physically backed Bitcoin ETF indirectly own a portion of the underlying bitcoin. One of the main concerns is the security of the bitcoin held by the custodian, therefore it is crucial for the custodian to have robust security measures in place to protect the underlying asset.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Bitcoin Futures ETFs</strong> do not hold bitcoin. Instead, they are futures contracts, which derive their value from the price of bitcoin, allowing investors to gain exposure to bitcoin without directly owning the digital currency. Since the ETF holds futures contracts rather than physical bitcoin, investors can easily buy and sell shares on traditional exchanges. This provides liquidity and flexibility for investors who want to take advantage of short-term price movements. However, it is important to note that futures-based ETFs may not provide the same level of direct exposure to bitcoin as physically backed ETFs. The value of the futures contracts may not perfectly track the price of bitcoin, and there can be discrepancies due to factors such as market sentiment and trading volume. Additionally, the use of futures contracts introduces counterparty risk, as investors are exposed to the financial stability of the futures exchange.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Bitcoin Mining ETFs</strong> allow investors to have exposure to the profits of bitcoin mining companies without needing to buy the stocks of each company individually. Mining is the process through which new bitcoins are released into circulation and the records of bitcoin transactions are cryptographically hashed into blocks. The value of the ETF would go up or down based on the aggregate performance of the companies it's tracking. The main idea behind such an ETF is to allow investors to benefit from the growth of the Bitcoin mining industry, while also <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/blackrock-etf-would-supercharge-bitcoin-mining">expediting sector investment and validate the industry’s efforts so far.</a></li></ul><ul><li><strong>Short Bitcoin ETFs</strong> try to profit from a decline in the value of bitcoin. Shorting is a financial strategy where an investor borrows a security or an asset, like bitcoin, and sells it, expecting the price to fall. The investor then plans to buy the security back at a lower price and return it to the lender, keeping the difference as profit. A Bitcoin Short ETF uses various financial instruments (like derivatives and futures contracts) to create the effect of shorting bitcoin, providing investors with profits if the price of vitcoin decreases. </li></ul><ul><li><strong>Long Bitcoin ETFs</strong> are the opposite of Short Bitcoin ETFs. These ETFs try to profit from an increase in the value of bitcoin. Going long is a financial strategy where an investor holds an asset or a futures contract where the holder is obligated to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined and agreed-upon price. A Bitcoin Long ETF uses various financial instruments (like derivatives and futures contracts) to create the effect of going long bitcoin, providing investors with profits if the price of bitcoin increases. Essentially, all Spot Bitcoin ETFs could be considered Long Bitcoin ETFs, though a specifically Long Bitcoin ETF might also trade in derivatives or futures contracts as well.</li></ul><h2>Why The Need For An ETF?</h2><p>While there are several ways to invest in bitcoin, such as buying the digital currency directly on a cryptocurrency exchange or investing in Bitcoin-related companies, the introduction of a Bitcoin ETF offers several differentiating features. </p><p>First, it provides a regulated and accessible way for investors to gain exposure to bitcoin. This is particularly appealing to investors who are unfamiliar or uncomfortable with navigating the intricacies of cryptocurrency exchanges. ETFs are subject to regulatory oversight, providing investors with a level of protection and transparency.</p><p>Second, a Bitcoin ETF allows investors to gain exposure to bitcoin without the need to directly hold the digital currency. This eliminates the complexities and security risks associated with storing and safeguarding bitcoin. Additionally, ETFs provide investors with the ability to easily buy and sell shares, enhancing liquidity and reducing transaction costs.</p><p>Third, many investors are not allowed to hold bitcoin outright, they can only do so via regulated financial offerings, such as ETFs. </p><h2>How Does A Bitcoin ETF Work?</h2><p>When an investor buys shares of a Bitcoin ETF, they are essentially buying a piece of the fund, which holds bitcoin as its underlying asset. The fund is responsible for managing the bitcoin holdings and tracking its performance. The price of the ETF shares is determined by the market demand and the net asset value (NAV) of the underlying bitcoin holdings.</p><p>The fund provider secures the bitcoin against theft or hacking attempts. The fund provider also handles the buying and selling of bitcoin, based on the demand for the ETF shares and the creation and redemption process.</p><p>Investors can buy and sell shares of the Bitcoin ETF on a stock exchange, just like any other publicly traded security. This provides them with the flexibility to enter and exit their positions at any time throughout the trading day.</p><h2>History Of Bitcoin ETFs In The United States</h2><p>Many types of bitcoin ETFs have been in the works for several years. The SEC has yet to approve of any of the spot bitcoin ETF applications, but has approved futures bitcoin ETFs. Some firms who were unable to get approval for a spot bitcoin ETF have created closed-end bitcoin trusts instead. Since June 2023, a significant number of Spot ETFs from BlackRock and other funds have been submitted, and it’s expected that a bitcoin spot ETF will be approved relatively soon.</p><h2>History of International ETFs</h2><p>While investors in the U.S. have not had the option to trade a spot bitcoin ETF project and only recently been able to get bitcoin exposure with a futures bitcoin ETF, investors in other countries have a handful of financial products that give them this option.</p><ul><li>The world's first Bitcoin ETF is listed on the Bermuda Stock Exchange: launched September 2020.</li><li>Canada approves its first Bitcoin ETF, the Purpose Bitcoin ETF (BTCC): launched February 2021. </li><li>The Evolve Bitcoin ETF (EBIT) and the CI Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCX) get approved in Canada shortly thereafter: launched February 2021.</li><li>Europe’s first ETF, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/europes-first-spot-bitcoin-etf-now-listed-on-euronext-amsterdam">launched by Jacobi Asset Management in August 2023</a>.</li></ul><h2>Pros & Cons</h2><p>As with any investment product, Bitcoin ETFs have their own set of advantages and disadvantages. The various flavors of ETFs have their own pros and cons, so in this article we’ll just touch upon the basics. </p><h3>Pros:</h3><ul><li>Allows for access and exposure to bitcoin to companies and individuals alike which cannot or will not purchase the asset itself.</li><li>Eliminates the complexities and security risks of directly holding bitcoin. </li><li>Enhances liquidity and reduces transaction costs.</li><li>Regulated and transparent investment vehicles which are attractive to many investors. </li></ul><h3>Cons:</h3><ul><li>Regulatory authorities have expressed concerns regarding market manipulation and investor protection. </li><li>Futures based ETFs enable market manipulation. </li><li>Investors are reliant on the fund provider's management and security measures.

These parties are basically diametrically opposed to the other. As of late, both sides have drifted to the extreme edges of the political spectrum to a point where they can’t agree on a basic set of facts about America. Both parties essentially live in two different worlds and can hardly speak to one another. This is what political polarization looks like.</p><p>This polarization has resulted in serious problems for the country. For many of us, nothing ever seems to change from administration to administration. I wonder if anyone can anyone honestly say with a straight face that things haven’t ultimately stayed the same, from presidents George Bush to Joe Biden.</p><p>The United States government is <a href="https://usafacts.org/state-of-the-union/budget/">still overspending to the tune of trillions of dollars per year</a> and stealing the future from our kids and grandkids to pay for social security, medicare and military bases overseas which are needed to protect the dollar as the reserve currency of the world.</p><p>The people at the top of this pyramid are incentivized to keep the system going for as long as possible. This is why Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump and Biden all march to the same drum once they get into office. The ultimate goal is to keep the money printer going for as long as possible because, once the music stops, it’s all over for the rich and powerful. They will be blamed for the calamity that will unfold.</p><p>Many Americans understand this dynamic at some level and are surely tired of the partisan warfare, preferring a government that works and is not too intrusive. This bears out in a recent poll conducted by Gallup.<a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/04/17/poll-americans-independent-republican-democrat"> </a>The poll found that <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/04/17/poll-americans-independent-republican-democrat">49% of Americans identify as political independents</a>. Simultaneously, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/04/17/poll-americans-independent-republican-democrat">25% identify as Republicans and 25% identify as Democrats</a>.</p><h2>Moving On From The Politically Entrenched</h2><figure>

    </figure><p>According to the Annie E. Casey Foundation,<a href="https://datacenter.aecf.org/data/tables/99-total-population-by-child-and-adult-populations#detailed/1/any/false/1095,870,573,869,36/40/416,417"> 260 million people in the U.S. are over the age of 18</a> and therefore eligible to vote. If you take half of this number and put those people in the “politically-independent” camp, then that’s 130 million people who must be dissatisfied with <em>both</em> political parties and are looking for new solutions to their problems.</p><p>Will these politically-independent voters become Bitcoiners overnight? No, but with the right message, I think many of them can learn and begin to understand how powerful Bitcoin is and the problems it can solve. Bitcoin smashes the false, “red versus blue” narrative into a million pieces, never to be reconstituted again.</p><p>As such, the political climate in the U.S. today offers a massive opportunity for Bitcoiners to speak to a group of people ready to hear the message of hope that Bitcoin brings to the world.</p><p>For the other 50% of voters who are more-deeply entrenched in the narratives that the Democrats and Republicans are disseminating, honestly, I don’t know if they will take the time to understand Bitcoin. I hope they do, for their own sakes, but I don’t have much faith that they will. They are too caught up in the red versus blue dichotomy to see that it’s a false narrative and that both primary parties collude to keep third parties off the ballot across the U.S.</p><p>But what about followers of a third political party, whose ideal might more closely align with Bitcoin? I conducted a Twitter poll to investigate the political leanings of the average Bitcoiner. I had a feeling that the respondents would lean heavily Libertarian. The results confirmed what I thought to be true:</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk5NzUzMDMzODI1OTIwNjQw/bitcoin-politics-poll.jpg" height="333" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption><a href="https://twitter.com/BTC_Apostle/status/1680927525017640963"><em>Source</em></a></figcaption>
    </figure><p>This was just an impromptu poll on Twitter, but I would suspect that the larger numbers wouldn’t vary too much from these results. It is probably safe to say that many within the Libertarian party either own bitcoin or have heard about it. If the U.S. were full of Libertarians, we would have massive adoption right now, but we don’t, and that is because people who identify as Libertarians represent just a small fraction of the population.</p><p>It should be no surprise that Libertarians make up a tiny portion of the electorate<a href="https://qz.com/1284178/almost-half-of-cryptocurrency-and-bitcoin-bros-identify-as-libertarian#:~:text=According%20to%20a%20recent%20study,with%203.3%25%20of%20the%20vote."> but make up a large majority of Bitcoin holders.</a> Unfortunately, from what I’ve seen, the creators of Bitcoin content tend to make content that appeals to the Libertarian crowd, not to the vast majority of Americans, many of whom are politically independent.</p><p>The bottom line is that Bitcoin adoption among hardcore cypherpunks, anarchists and Libertarians is essentially tapped out. If mass Bitcoin adoption in America is going to move forward, our messaging must change to appeal to more middle-of-the-road types of open-minded people. As Americans wake up to the problems with our political dichotomy, these increasingly-independent thinkers are who we need coming into Bitcoin.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Robert Hall.

This milestone provides an interesting perspective and other on-chain data helps us paint a more comprehensive picture. Following typical bitcoin capitulation events, the supply often gets constrained by the participants with the most conviction. We now find ourselves precisely in such a phase: A mere 13% of circulating supply is held on exchanges and in the hands of short-term holders.</p><p>However, it’s important to note that while current price action and realized profits do not necessarily support the notion of a full-fledged bull market, we thus far have witnessed previous realized losses/on-chain capitulation turning into a small yet steady stream of profits (old coins moving at a higher price level than they were acquired for). </p><p>As shown below, the market-value-to-realized-value metric paints a picture of the birth of a nascent new bull market, with valuations no longer at bottom-barrel levels but still far from relatively overpriced, currently ranking in the 39% of historical readings.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Looking at the rate of change of the realized price, the historical analog of the current market look to be the early months of 2016 and the summer of 2019, where price had sufficiently rebounded off the lows, with most of the bleeding finally over, as the market consolidated amid constrained supply conditions and a growing network effect of real world adoption.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Realized Cap, Not Market Cap</h2><p>The logarithmic chart of bitcoin’s realized market capitalization, reflecting the aggregate value of all bitcoin at their last traded price, demonstrates the asset’s resilience. Unlike market cap, which is the product of circulating supply and current price, the realized cap shows the precise value of each bitcoin UTXO, courtesy of its transparent ledger.</p><p>Realized cap paints a far different picture regarding bitcoin’s monetization compared to what one may be led to believe when viewing bitcoin’s hyper-volatile mark-to-market exchange rate.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>A mere 15% below the realized market cap all-time high, capital inflows have returned, resembling previous bear market recoveries. During recovery periods following bitcoin bear markets, we have seen a reclaim of the previous all-time high in realized market cap while bitcoin was still 40%-60% below its all-time high exchange rate. This historical dynamic demonstrates a couple things:</p><p>First, it suggests that capital inflows can continue to seep into bitcoin without necessarily triggering a raging bull market, instead leading to an environment of chop and consolidation. This is often characterized by a tug-of-war between marginal buyers and sellers, where price levels witness repeated tests of resistance and support, all while accumulation from HODLers continues under the surface.</p><p>Second, it shows a historical reality where bitcoin’s true valuation — the price where all its supply has traded hands — surpasses the all-time high long before the media frenzy and new wave of speculative inflows arrive again. One can view this as an ode to the “smart money” investors, who don’t need the explicit signal of a nominal exchange rate all-time high to understand that bitcoin’s fundamentals are stronger than ever.</p><p>A demonstration of this dynamic is the net realized profits relative to the bitcoin market cap. Following the worst of a bear market capitulation, bitcoin market inflows are distinctly positive (but not yet over zealous) while the exchange rate grinds higher to eventually flirt with price all-time highs. </p><p>Once the all-time high is broken, inflows ramp up dramatically. The setup for this market cycle is still in the early stages.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Unrealized Profit/Loss </h2><p>We’ve examined realized profit and loss cycles, so now let's turn to the unrealized side of the equation. </p><p>Relative Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) is an insightful metric designed to gauge investor sentiment in the bitcoin market by calculating the total unrealized gains or losses across the current supply. To calculate the NUPL, subtract the realized cap (which represents the value of each bitcoin when it last moved on the blockchain) from the market cap, then express this difference as a ratio of the market cap. This metric works to standardize the state of the unrealized profits/losses held by investors using the market capitalization to account for an ever changing market valuation. </p><ul><li>A higher ratio typically suggests a state of greed or speculative froth among investors, indicative of potential market tops or overbuying conditions. </li></ul><ul><li>In contrast, a lower ratio generally signals an atmosphere of fear or capitulation, potentially pointing to market bottoms or overselling scenarios.</li></ul><p>In the current climate, NUPL stands at 0.37, a level we can categorize as optimism/anxiety, depending on the trend direction.</p><p>It's noteworthy that the bitcoin market has never seen a recovery in NUPL from the capitulation phase to the optimism phase without a subsequent visit to one or both of the two highest tiers of NUPL: belief and euphoria.</p><p>Translated into simpler terms, this suggests that bitcoin market recoveries, even from the most severe conditions, lead to brighter days ahead due to the resilience of the bitcoin HODLer base and a consistent transfer of coins from weak hands to strong ones. The ongoing wealth transfer underpins market recoveries, reinforcing bitcoin's inherent strength and setting the stage for further growth and potential price appreciation during the next period of capital inflows.</p><p>Having just recovered from the depths of the bear market in late 2022, the setup now mirrors historical market recoveries of past cycles, as bitcoin once again climbs the wall of worry.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Free Float Constraints And UTXO Distribution</h2><p>Another metric we can look at to show just how sparse the figurative air is above the current trading range is the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD). </p><p>The URPD reveals that above $31,000, only a limited supply has exchanged hands, with the majority of transactions occurring in the $15,000-$30,000 range. The first major resistance point from a supply distribution level is around $40,000. This also aligns with the spot volume trading distribution, as well as the technical breakdown of the chart.&nbsp;</p><figure>

This expansion is part of the company's strategy to establish a stronger presence within the United States, as currently, GDA accounts for 2% of the total hash rate of the Bitcoin network.</p><p>Since February 2023, the first data center has been operating near the town of Anderson, SC, boasting a total capacity of 18 MW. Not long after, in March 2023, the other two facilities located between the towns of Union and Lockhart commenced operations with a combined capacity of 15 MW.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>The Anderson data center was constructed using North American-built infrastructure equipment, repurposing an abandoned textile warehouse. 95% of the personnel involved in constructing the two other facilities were hired locally within South Carolina, fostering economic growth and creating nearly 150 jobs, with 125 of these positions being filled by local contractors instrumental in setting up the data centers.</p><p>“I am extremely proud of the entire GDA team for opening these new facilities in only a few months,” said Ankit Joshi, GDA's Head of North American operations. “We were impressed to see how these local communities welcomed us so warmly as an opportunity for their economy.”</p><p>The choice of South Carolina as the location for these data centers was not accidental. The state's abundance of clean energy sources played a significant role in the decision-making process. One of the data centers, the Pacolet facility, is situated just 3 miles away from two hydroelectric generation plants operated by Lockhart Power, a major renewable and clean energy supplier in the region. Additionally, the Anderson data center is equipped with Hitachi's environment-friendly dry type distribution transformers, and it will serve as a vital resource for Duke Energy in strengthening the local energy grid by returning excess power when needed.</p><p>"The opening of these new data centers is perfectly in line with our commitment to expand our fleet on clean energy resources," said&nbsp;Andrey Kim, the CEO of GDA.&nbsp;"Our goal is to be industry leaders and show the world that Bitcoin mining can be very ESG-friendly.”</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk5NzUyNDM1MjE0ODUzMjIz/screen-shot-2023-07-31-at-112252-am.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk5NzUyNDA3MDI5MTMwMzQz/screen-shot-2023-07-31-at-112139-am.png" height="351" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Buy and Sell Rare Bitcoin with Bitcoin Magazine]]></title><description><![CDATA[Bitcoin Magazine launches white-glove service for collectors and HNW investors looking for the rarest sats and inscriptions on the market.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/buy-and-sell-rare-bitcoin-with-bitcoin-magazine</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/buy-and-sell-rare-bitcoin-with-bitcoin-magazine</guid><category><![CDATA[Markets]]></category><category><![CDATA[NFT]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sats]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin]]></category><category><![CDATA[Ordinals]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Bitcoin Magazine]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk5NzYwNjAwNDg0NTUzODMx/rare_btc_thumbnail_liquid_bg-3.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Officially out of beta, Bitcoin Magazine is excited to make public its new over-the-counter service,&nbsp;<a href="https://rare.b.tc" rel="nofollow">Rare B.TC</a>,&nbsp;which enables users to buy and sell rare sats – bitcoins that have a history or provenance that makes them more valuable to collectors – as well as rare inscriptions.</p><p>Today, finding rare bitcoins can be difficult.

Today, capoeira has evolved into a popular and globally-recognized martial art, known for devastating kicks, devious sweeps and dazzling acrobatics. Presented are examples of capoeira being played <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCQ9A-lg4k8">slowly and beautifully</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_MxxCu9TRs">quickly and acrobatically</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Hgq0c3mZwI">more aggressively</a> with takedown attempts..</p><p>Behind all of the flashy moves, however, is a much deeper essence. The true seeker finds that capoeira is a <em>way of being</em> that fully encompasses African expressions of fight, dance, music, art, ritual, spirituality and philosophy into one in a pursuit of liberation. Over the centuries, capoeira has been shepherded, protected and propagated by a nomadic, decentralized, warrior-sage-trickster culture that has rebuffed every attempt to suppress, institutionalize, centralize or destroy it. </p><p>But what does any of this have to do with Bitcoin? </p><p>First, in capoeira (which I have practiced since 2005) and in Bitcoin, I see kindred cultures of liberation that can learn from and benefit one another. I believe the two complement each other extremely well as parallel paths for radical liberation, one through body discipline and the other through sound money and both, interestingly, building up similar habits of mind. </p><p>Second, where much of “Bitcoining” is objective, rooted in mathematics, capoeira is much the opposite — <em>capoeira is a mystery</em>:<em> </em>fluid, emergent, always changing, always challenging, a thing to be experienced but never fully known. Yet, despite these differences, just like Bitcoin, capoeira bends the practitioner into embracing unending learning and demands the practitioner’s acceptance of ceaseless, unyielding change. We capoeiristas say “capoeira changes you,” and as Bitcoiners, we know full well that Bitcoin does the same.</p><p>Finally, capoeira is a practice that forces the development of jest and “good humor” — the ability to strike and take strikes, to both fall hard and knock others down just the same, all with a laugh and a genuine smile — and a presence devoid of heavy emotions like anger, jealousy or pride. In this, capoeira, while still fully acknowledging a dangerous and adversarial world, offers a healthy counterbalance to the type of dour humorlessness that sometimes finds us in Bitcoining. </p><p>Let us consider some other interesting parallels…</p><h2>If You Like Bitcoin, Consider Capoeira</h2><h3>Mysterious Origins</h3><p>Much as the real-world identity of Satoshi Nakamoto is unknown, the true genesis of capoeira is unknowable — a secret lost to time in the wide, dark belly of the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/the-middle-passage.htm">Middle Passage</a>. However, much like with Nakamoto’s identity, many competing theories and much debate on the subject of capoeira’s origins persists.</p><h3>Pseudonymous, Outlaw Culture </h3><p>Capoeira was persecuted in Brazil and even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capoeira">formally outlawed from the 1890s to 1930s</a>. Pushing capoeira underground gave rise to the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capoeira">apelido</a>,” or nickname — used to shield the practitioners’ legal identities from the state and from each other. If one capoeirista was caught by the law, they’d have no one else to give up — the most a lawman could get would be a list of silly aliases that could represent anyone. Today, many capoeiristas will simply introduce themselves by their apelido — and, as with a Bitcoiner’s “nym,” no further questions need be asked.</p><h3>Leaderless Decentralization</h3><p>While there are now and have always been leaders <em>in</em> capoeira, there is no leader <em>of</em> capoeira. Each <em>mestre</em> (master) teaches in their own way, each group is different and the groups themselves are constantly merging, separating and reforming. And, as the human body is the only requirement for the practice, capoeira exists <em>wherever the people are</em>, which is to say, anywhere and everywhere. No wonder past attempts to exterminate it have always been futile. This is, of course, an inspiring parallel to Bitcoin’s own decentralized and leaderless persistence.</p><h3>Adversarial Mindset</h3><p>Where Bitcoiners speak of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_security">OPSEC</a>,” the capoeirista has “malícia”<em> </em>— a heightened and ever-present adversarial awareness<em>.</em> However, in the game of capoeira (you do not <em>fight</em> capoeira, you <em>play</em> capoeira), players do not block attacks, rather, they move with the attack, dodging out of the way. Thus emerges capoeira’s revolving, circular game of “flow,” where every defense sets up the next counterattack and every attack finishes in defensive<em>/</em>evasive posture. The skilled capoeirista is always thinking several moves ahead, anticipating their opponent and changing their movements in an attempt to misdirect, confuse and entrap. In the larger game of everyday life, malícia manifests as an adeptness in reading people, the ability to anticipate human situations well before they arise and, therefore, to position accordingly. </p><h3>Radical And Asymmetrical Liberation</h3><p>Capoeira is an artifact of slavery and oppression. It empowers the individual, particularly one who cannot afford to attack head on, to leverage every part of their body — hands, feet, elbows, knees, arms, legs, hips, head, torso — and even to pursue extended periods of inversion, as unexpected and shockingly effective tools of self defense. And in so liberating the body, capoeira also unshackles the practitioner's mind to think and see differently, and to plan for or to put into motion whatever is most unexpected — to become adept in navigating the vagaries of an unpredictable and unjust world. </p><p>In the historical context, capoeira has always been a “sly, roundabout” thing that the system could not stop. Capeoria stood as an asymmetrical challenge-resistance to the prevailing, exploitative system of its time. Similarly today, Bitcoin provides an asymmetrical “opt-out” of the fiat system, especially for those who cannot confront the system head on. Here, Bitcoin allows us all to behave like capoeira players, foiling rather than fighting, dodging rather than engaging, and placing ourselves always just out of reach of the system's attacks.</p><h2>What Can These Communities Learn From One Another?</h2><p>So, what then can the Bitcoiner learn from capoeira? And what can the capoeirista learn from Bitcoin?</p><p>For the Bitcoiner, capoeira can offer a greater appreciation of whimsy, play and mystery, along with unexpected avenues to physical fitness, self defense and cultural enrichment. While capoeira can be plenty lethal when necessary, it cares not about winning or losing. Capoeira is not to beat, dominate or destroy an opponent — capoeira is simply to <em>play</em> — to enjoy the thrill of the danger and to revel in the beauty and mystery of conversation made by human bodies in motion. Capoeira teaches you to defend yourself, to think differently and to think ahead, to be of fit body and sound mind, but also to dance and laugh well always — because one day, surely, you will die — so you had better enjoy the ride. </p><p>For the capoeirista, well, Bitcoin offers what it offers everyone: true liberation to <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/store-of-value">store value</a>, free from theft and debasement. But here, the capoeirista ought to find double significance, as this is so much of what was denied to the very people who created capoeira under the heavy, thieving chains of slavery. Bitcoin is also a perfect complement to capoeira’s culture of individualism, liberation, wandering and informal economy.

And, as such, this “magic internet money” that lives on a decentralized, permissionless system is changing the world right in front of us. </p><p>One of Bitcoin’s many superpowers is that it takes on different aliases in various cultural environments. For many comparatively-wealthy North Americans, views on Bitcoin range from an annoying Thanksgiving dinner conversation topic to a technological breakthrough that may sever the state’s monopoly on money. At the same time, any American who is underrepresented and underserved by the legacy financial system is more likely to find that Bitcoin is a means of transferring value without having to have a bank account. </p><p>For someone living in Zimbabwe, where the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/455290/inflation-rate-in-zimbabwe/">inflation rate is over 100%</a> year over year, Bitcoin is a lifeline against fiat currency devaluation. Salvadoran citizens use bitcoin as a currency, Vietnamese citizens see bitcoin as a robust <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/store-of-value">store of value</a>. The list of Bitcoin’s various offerings goes on and on. </p><p>But no matter where you find yourself in the world, Bitcoin should represent freedom. Ironically, for people in the developing world, there are far more important stressors consuming their minds than those of the philosophical musings of Bitcoiners living in the developed world. For example, Togolese citizens just want a means to independently transact and save in a currency that, while volatile, isn’t inflating away at an alarming pace. </p><p>Farida Nabourema is a Togolese activist who has bravely fought for democracy in her country. She unashamedly speaks out against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Togo">one of the world’s most-brutal and one of the continent’s longest-reigning autocracies</a>. When Nabourema was just 13 years old, she began her activism by learning from her father, who had followed in his own parents’ courageous footsteps. She has founded and led <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/13/africa/farida-nabourema-togo-activist/index.html">national movements</a>, written over <a href="https://nabourema.com/index.php/publication/">400 articles</a> calling out the oppression and dictatorship in Togo, <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/farida_nabourema_is_your_country_at_risk_of_becoming_a_dictatorship_here_s_how_to_know?language=en">appeared on TED</a> and countless podcasts and much more. </p><p>Nabourema would tell you that when she first heard about Bitcoin, she was skeptical. But, like many of us, the more she learned about Bitcoin, the more she realized how perfectly it fit with her <a href="https://nabourema.com/">advocacy for democracy</a>, specifically as it relates to financial freedom and literacy for women and youth. </p><p>Below is some brief insight into Nabourema’s thoughts about Bitcoin and why it’s important to close its cultural gender gap.</p><p><strong>How did you first learn about Bitcoin and what specifically drew you to it?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I started learning about Bitcoin specifically because I wanted an alternate way of sending money to my country, Togo, without the government censorship. My country is ruled by a very repressive military regime that has been in power for 57 years and bans all forms of protests. As an activist, I was working with several others to take action against the regime when the government started arresting people for donating money to the movement, it became apparent that we needed a safe way to send and receive funds for resistance activities.</p><p><strong>How do you see Bitcoin positively impacting the lives of children and families in Togo?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The question is a bit cliche. The children of Togo are just like children in the United States or elsewhere. We believe financial education is important for each child which is why we launched the Bitcoin For Youngsters program in secondary schools this year and have so far trained more than 3,000 students. We launched the program as we know Bitcoin isn’t included on our curricula (otherwise) and we know it will play a big role in their future and open their mind to possible careers and or entrepreneurship. But to say that Bitcoin specifically benefits kids in Togo in the current day, is too much of a stretch.</p><p><strong>How do you typically respond to those who are dismissive of Bitcoin, especially those close to you?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Honestly, I don’t reach out to friends and family to teach them about Bitcoin. I never do that because I don’t consider myself a Bitcoin evangelist and people are very sensitive and aggressive when it comes to money and the less they know, the more aggressive they are. </p><p>I would rather go to communities that have been excluded from the financial system or that need an alternative to the existing ones to teach them about Bitcoin and they always welcome it because it works for them and they need a solution anyway. These are farmers, activists, young people. Now, while seeing me do that, some close friends come to me and ask to learn and because the request comes from them, not me trying to impose it on them, and they are very receptive to it. </p><p>When it comes to people’s money, especially on our part of the continent where incomes are low yet financial constraints are numerous and the system is difficult to navigate, I am considerate of the fact that people may not want to take major financial risks. Nonetheless, no one is opposed to learning how to protect their money from both the government and inflation. </p><p>People are keen to build that knowledge. Of course, many come with a whole lot of misconceptions about Bitcoin, but for those who I have trained, I always start my education with debunking the myths around Bitcoin, then proceed to tell them that they must never entrust anyone with their bitcoin and should always self custody. This makes them realize that they have ownership unlike the vast majority of shitcoins that literally operate like Ponzi schemes. I start with debunking the myths, then self custody, then I explain why it is sound money. But in the end, I am not one of those people who will get into an argument trying to force folks to accept that Bitcoin is the best thing that has ever happened to the world. Oftentimes, those who hate Bitcoin do not need it anyway. Them knowing it is a plus but they are doing fine with their current system and are happy with it.</p><p><strong>In your opinion, why is it important to close the gender gap in Bitcoin interest and adoption?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Education and increased opportunities for women: that is the only way forward. </p><p>Women, especially in Togo, have historically faced economic discrimination. Bitcoin offers us an opportunity to narrow the wealth gap between genders as it is money that does not discriminate and it can be earned by anyone. But in order for us to achieve this, we need to invest in women’s education on Bitcoin and understand that bitcoin cannot be called “freedom money” if the most marginalized by the existing financial structures do not have a fair share of it. Bitcoin needs women to thrive. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Becca Bratcher.

That is not to say that bitcoin is not money. Bitcoin is undoubtedly money. However, to think it is merely a technological innovation that transcends the archaic systems of the Federal Reserve, legacy banking, Visa, Mastercard and so on would be a profoundly-erroneous error. </p><p>Bitcoin solves a problem that, ironically, was both the catalyst for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic">Neolithic era</a> and something that has plagued humanity for thousands of years: the use of our abstract minds to rely on symbolism and create greater cooperation among our species.&nbsp;Money is but one result of the abstract-thinking mind of the human being, which similarly gave rise to complex language and the use of symbols and storytelling. This Catch-22 is evident through a synthesis of the power projection theory outlined in “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Softwar-Projection-National-Strategic-Significance/dp/B0BW358F37">Softwar</a>” by Jason Lowry, <a href="https://twitter.com/JasonPLowery">a member of the U.S. Space Force</a>, and my own calm pond theory (<a href="https://themindfulinquisitor.com/2023/06/16/the-ancient-way-of-the-mind-an-abstract/">described here</a>). In short, these two theories highlight how the massive developmental breakthroughs achieved by our abstract minds come with their drawbacks, which have been unresolvable until the invention of Bitcoin. </p><h2>The Calm Pond Theory</h2><p>My calm pond theory suggests that a mind characterized by mindfulness optimizes the brain’s ability to regulate and maintain health within the body and grants an individual a more accurate interpretation of reality itself. Consider that the brain receives a deluge of neurotransmitters to comprehend the state of the body and the external world. To properly understand the incoming information and react accordingly, it constructs a model, constantly testing, refining and rectifying it to enhance the model's accuracy, a process we experience as consciousness. </p><p>Now, envision the brain as a pond, where raindrops represent neurotransmitters, gently hitting the pond and forming ripples that serve as the key to interpreting information. When the pond is calm, these ripples are distinct and easily discernible, enabling accurate interpretation. However, the demand of our modern world imposes endless mental rumination, causing a rainstorm of neuronal activity. The numerous ripples formed in a rainstorm collide and interfere with one another, making it significantly more challenging for the brain to construct an accurate model of the world, since understanding individual ripples becomes nearly impossible. </p><p>It is likely that a state of mind akin to a calm pond is what was typical for more ancient human beings, highlighting a tremendous health concern when one considers the fact that we are building a technological society that requires most of us to be using our analytical minds constantly to maintain its structure. In other words, the mental process necessary for us to build this beautiful ivory tower is making our bodies and minds very sick. </p><h2>Power Projection Theory</h2><p>Before addressing how Bitcoin solves this millennia-old problem, let us first recognize the similarity between the above idea and the conclusions of power projection theory.</p><p>Our abstract minds not only gave rise to money and logical thinking but also gave us the ability to use symbolic language through storytelling. Lowery’s thesis, fully titled “Softwar: A Novel Theory Of Power Projection And The National Strategic Significance Of Bitcoin,” describes how energy and life formed by using energy (referred to as “power”) to sequester other energy (referred to as “resources”) away from the environment to be used for more personal gain. </p><p>This can be observed not only in the first prokaryotic cells that formed in the hydrothermal vents that exist in the fissures of the seafloor, but also in the way animals behave in the wild. As Lowry explains, at the cellular level, a lipid bilayer was formed on the seafloor, which projected power by creating a physical barrier that trapped resources, facilitating chemical reactions leading to a biological system. At the level of multicellular organisms, Lowry uses the illustration of wolves snarling their fangs at a would-be thief of their recently-acquired game to broadcast the information that the cost of stealing the resources would be higher than the benefit gained from the food. Here, the wolf is projecting power to keep its resources. </p><p>Following such reasoning, pack animals such as wolves must create power hierarchies within their communities so that the strongest wolf, most capable of efficient power projection, is fed and allowed to reproduce and the pack can have the most power-projection capabilities to protect their resources. To do so, wolves must physically fight among themselves. This is an unfortunate requirement, Lowry points out, as two wolves will fight until one wolf has their fangs on the jugular of another to prove superiority. </p><p>The physicality required to create power hierarchies can therefore prove dangerous and fratricidal. According to Lowry, other animals, such as deer, solve this issue with the development of antlers, which allow them to project power against other species, but leads to safe competition within their own species, as the antlers simply tangle when they butt heads with a diminished risk of fatal wounds. In this way, deer developed a biological method of managing internal power hierarchies and, therefore, internal resource management, using physical power but with a relatively-decreased risk of fratricide. </p><p>Lowry argues that humans have developed a similar method of internal organization through our abstract thinking, even though it comes with a significant cost. He puts forth the idea that, through language and storytelling, human beings developed a form of abstract power projection to organize resources without physical violence. There are many examples of this, such as the development of judicial systems in which abstract power is placed in the hands of a judge and State so they can manage resources in a peaceful manner. Of course, physical force is still used within human societies to manage resources. Yet, there is a constant effort through language and reasoning to avoid such physical violence and for us to manage our resources peacefully. </p><p>The importance of the power projection theory is made evident when one realizes that nature only understands the organization of resources through physical power. Physical energy is used to manage resource energy. Put another way: Nature does not recognize the management of resources through any other means, including abstract power projection. Therefore, human beings are stuck in a problematic cycle in which we attempt to organize our societies and resources through abstract power projection, only to have them collapse under the weight of their hollow foundation through physical power projection. </p><p>To our understandable discontent and frustration, war and revolutions are constantly occurring as nature's only proper mechanism of organizing resources. </p><h2>Managing Resources With Bitcoin</h2><p>These two theories share the common theme that human beings' use of abstract thinking gave rise to dilemmas of conflicting requirements. </p><p>In the case of the calm pond theory, to build this complex society that increases economic well-being, we are forced to use our minds in a chronically-analytical way, which deteriorates our bodies’ and minds’ ability to regulate themselves and maintain health and well-being properly. </p><p>In the case of power projection theory, to build a more peaceful society, we have used abstract thinking to construct stories of conceptual power structures that lead to a cycle of temporary peace and inevitable war because, ultimately, nature can only manage resources through physical power. </p><p>The solution to both issues: Bitcoin. </p><p>Though offering a bleak outlook on how humans must organize themselves, Lowry provides hope by highlighting how Bitcoin manages resources using physical power. In other words, it is the technological antler of human beings. It ultimately solves the frail nature of our abstract power system, making it obsolete while replacing it with a non-violent means of using physical power to manage our resources. </p><p>The solution for the calm pond theory's conclusions are outlined in a previous article for Bitcoin Magazine, “<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-and-artificial-intelligence-frees-your-time">How Bitcoin And Artificial Intelligence Will Free Your Time</a>.” In short, the computer, of which Bitcoin is but one aspect, is a thinking machine designed to perform all of the tasks that our abstract-thinking mind can. Most notably, it can think logically and manage our money. </p><p>As we slowly build this machine and make it more and more capable of thinking for us, it will gradually alleviate our need to use our abstract minds to maintain our society personally. This will give us the freedom to pursue lives more focused on mindfulness and physical well-being. The computer, with Bitcoin, lifts the burden off of our shoulders so that our minds can be unrestricted, calm and, once again, more aligned with our true natures. </p><p>Bitcoin is more than just money; it is a revolutionary technology that solves some of humanity's most ancient problems. With these problems being solved, humanity is entering an unprecedented time in history, potentially characterized by an unparalleled rise in societal and mental peace and harmony. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Sydney Bright.

Disinflation seems to be setting in as a direct result of the Federal Reserve’s tightening monetary policies. This policy shift has led to a notable slowdown in the annualized sticky Consumer Price Index (CPI) over recent months. With this in view, the conversation among market participants has gradually shifted away from inflationary concerns and toward trying to understand the impact of the tightest monetary policy in a decade and a half.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk5NjgzODk5MzQ4MjMxODA4/fed-funds-rate-3-month-annualized.png" height="464" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption>Sticky CPI has slowed down in recent months.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>The high inflation we’ve experienced, particularly in the core basket (excluding food and energy), concealed the effects of the swiftest tightening cycle in history. Inflation was partially fueled by a tight labor market leading to increased wages, and resulting in a sustained second-half inflationary impulse driven more by wages than by energy costs.</p><p>It’s worth noting that the base effects for year-over-year inflation readings are peaking this month. This could lead to a reacceleration of inflationary readings on a year-over-year basis if wage inflation remains sticky or if energy prices resurge.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk5NjgzODk5MzQ4Mjk3MzQ0/inflation-heads-higher.png" height="508" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption>Chances of inflation heading higher by Q1 of 2024 remain high.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>Interestingly, real yields — calculated with both trailing 12-month inflation and forward expectations — are at their highest in decades. The contemporary economic landscape is notably different from the 1980s, and current debt levels cannot sustain positive real yields for extended periods without leading to deterioration and potential default.</p><p>Historically, major shifts in the market occur during Fed tightening and cutting cycles. These shifts often lead to distress in equity markets after the Fed initiates rate cuts. This isn’t intentional, but rather the side effects from tight monetary policy. Analyzing historical trends can provide valuable insights into potential market movements, especially the two-year yields as a proxy for the average of the next two years of Fed Funds.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Bonds And Equities: The Growing Disconnect</h2><p>Currently, there’s a sizable and growing disconnect between bond and equity markets. It’s not unusual for equity earnings to outperform bonds during an inflationary regime due to equities’ superior pricing power. However, with disinflation in motion, the growing divergence between equity multiples and real yields becomes a critical concern. This divergence can also be observed through the equity risk premium — equity yields minus bond yields.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Research from Goldman Sachs shows systematic investment strategies, namely Commodity Trading Advisors (CTA), volatility control and risk-parity strategies, have been increasingly using leverage to amplify their investment exposure. This ramp-up in leveraging has come in tandem with a positive performance in equity indices, which would be forced to unwind during any moves to the downside and/or spikes in volatility.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Headwinds Ahead For The U.S. Consumer? </h2><p>The robust earnings surprises and the U.S. consumer market’s resilience are being underpinned in part by excess savings from the COVID-era fiscal stimulus. However, it’s worth noting that these savings are not uniformly distributed. A recent BNP Paribas report estimates that the top income quintile holds just over 80% of the excess savings. The savings of the lower-income quintiles are already spent, with the middle quintile likely following suit soon. With factors like the resumption of student debt obligations and emerging weaknesses in the labor market, we should brace ourselves for potential stress in consumer markets.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Despite potential consumer market stressors, the performance of the U.S. economy in 2023 has surpassed expectations. Equity markets have put on a stellar show, with the bull market appearing unrelenting. Amidst these market celebrations, we must maintain a balanced perspective, understanding that the path forward may not be as clear cut or straightforward as it appears.</p><h2>Final Note</h2><p>We highlight developments in equity and interest rate conditions as we find it crucial to recognize the growing liquidity interplay between bitcoin and traditional asset markets. To put it plainly:</p><p>It signals substantial demand when the world’s largest asset managers are competing to launch a financial product that offers their clients exposure to bitcoin. These future inflows into bitcoin, predominantly from those currently invested in non-bitcoin assets, will inevitably intertwine bitcoin more closely with the risk-on/risk-off flows of global markets. This isn’t a detrimental development; on the contrary, it’s a progression to be embraced. We expect bitcoin’s correlation to risk-on assets in the traditional financial markets to increase, while outperforming to the upside and in a risk-adjusted manner over a longer time frame.</p><p>With that being said, turning back to the main content of the article, the historical precedent of significant lag in monetary policy, combined with the current conditions in the interest rate and equity markets does warrant some caution. Conventionally, equity markets decline and a technical recession occurs in the United States after the Fed begins to cut interest rates from the terminal level of the tightening cycle. We haven’t reached this condition yet. Therefore, even though we’re extremely optimistic about the native supply-side conditions for bitcoin today, we remain alert to all possibilities. For this reason, we remain open to the idea of potential downward pressure from legacy markets between now and mid-2024, a period marked by key events such as the Bitcoin halving and possible approval of a spot bitcoin ETF.</p><hr><p><em>That concludes the excerpt from a recent edition of Bitcoin Magazine PRO. </em><a href="https://bmpro.substack.com/subscribe"><em>Subscribe now</em></a><em> to receive PRO articles directly in your inbox.</em></p><figure>

The astonishing consequence is that the vast majority of people, nutritionists, and doctors today think that animal fat is harmful, while grains are healthy, necessary, and safe!”</p></blockquote><p>In other words, even though a meat-centered diet is superior to a grain-centered one, the government and its quasi-private partners succeeded in persuading millions of people into opting for the latter.</p><p>Ammous raises the topic of dietary guidelines as just one example of how a fiat standard distorts an industry, but there’s another lesson in this story that Bitcoiners have to grapple with: </p><p><em>Even if your product is the best on the market, governments (and other entities) are capable of spreading narratives that persuade citizens to choose an inferior alternative. </em></p><p>If it happened with food, it could happen with money. </p><h2>A CBDC Punch-Counterpunch</h2><p>On July 10, 2023, Karin Strohecker published an article in Reuters titled, “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/twenty-four-central-banks-will-have-digital-currencies-by-2030-bis-survey-2023-07-10/">Twenty-Four Central Banks Will Have Digital Currencies By 2030, Survey Shows</a>.” Apparently, a couple dozen central banks have been making “great” progress in their development of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Strohecker wrote that these central banks have been “working on digital versions of their currencies for retail use to <em>avoid leaving digital payments to the private sector </em>(emphasis added) amid an accelerating decline of cash.”</p><p>This purported motivation behind CBDCs has been brewing for a while — in August 2022, the European Central Bank (ECB) released a report called “<a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2693%7E8d4e580438.en.pdf">Towards The Holy Grail Of Cross-Border Payments</a>.” In it, the authors compared the merits and demerits of various technological implementations of a cross-border payment solution that might be “immediate, cheap, universal and settled in a secure settlement medium.” Of the candidates they considered, they concluded that “Bitcoin is least credible” and that “the interlinking of domestic instant payment systems and future CBDCs, both with a competitive FX conversion layer” are the two most credible solutions.</p><p>While the ECB left out any remark about the risks that CBDCs pose to citizens’ privacy and sovereignty, River Financial responded with a <a href="https://blog.river.com/bitcoin-vs-the-156-trillion-global-payments-industry/">report</a> of its own. Spearheaded by River’s Sam Wouters, this report <em>does </em>explain the gaping hole in the ECB’s argument for CBDCs, as well as the technological barriers that Bitcoin ought to overcome if it’s going to be adopted worldwide.</p><p>Readers can review the technical and quantitative arguments of both ECB and River Financial for themselves — my purpose in bringing up this punch-counterpunch is that the battle between freedom-money and tyranny-money is <em>not </em>one that we will win by default, and that it’s as much a battle for hearts and minds as it is for product superiority. Much like the propaganda campaign that persuaded people to switch from healthier diets to those that the government preferred, central banks are levying their best words, videos and other marketing techniques to convince people that CBDCs are superior to Bitcoin.</p><p>And, in the end, their victory is possible.</p><h2>Understanding The Education Process</h2><p><em>We</em> know that Bitcoin solves humanity’s many monetary problems far better than CBDCs do. <em>We </em>recognize the havoc that rampant inflation wreaks on nations. <em>We </em>understand that lacking a <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/store-of-value">store of value</a> is the cause of so many anti-civilizational behaviors. But that’s not enough. If others don’t understand the fiat origins of these problems, they don’t stand a chance of appreciating Bitcoin as their solution. Whether or not central banks recognize the importance of this knowledge in the battle over the future of money, they’re certainly taking every opportunity they can to spread ideas that push Bitcoin to the outskirts and earn CBDCs widespread acceptability. </p><p>“Bitcoin bad, CBDCs good,” the people think. And that’s all central banks need, the inferiority of their product be damned.</p><p>As Wouters rightly pointed out in his report:</p><blockquote><p>“Great strides have been made in education, but if Bitcoiners who are less experienced in education want to accelerate adoption, they would benefit from gaining a deeper understanding of the education process to take ownership of it and become more effective. This starts by understanding the gap between their perspective and knowledge and that of the recipient… (S)ome people inside the Bitcoin space are not aware enough of how difficult it is for the average person to go through this journey.”</p></blockquote><p>As much as Wouters heroically explains the “how,” “what,” and “why” of the technological improvements that will help Bitcoin achieve widespread adoption, none of these holds a candle to people's&nbsp;<em>ideas </em>about money. Even if Bitcoin eventually becomes as easy to use as credit cards or cash, the masses could still reject it in favor of CBDCs for purely-ideological reasons. Grain will have defeated meat once again.</p><p>This is no reason to despair. Bitcoin isn’t inevitable, no. But victory is <em>possible</em>, and its fate is largely determined on the ideological battlefield. The gap between our deepest explanation of monetary economics and most people's views on the subject is vast. The same goes for the problems that fiat money continues to cause, the dangers of CBDCs, and how and why Bitcoin is a panacea for most of our money problems. </p><p>The educational effort before us is enormous, but, in the face of the enemy’s propaganda, necessary. And it’s <em>thrilling</em> — billions of people are about to learn about the greatest civilizational battle they hadn’t even known was occurring right under their noses. </p><p>Our war is an ideological one. Bitcoin doesn’t have to suffer the same fate as meat — and the industrial sludge that is CBDCs can perish in the sewers of history. We have persuading to do.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Logan Chipkin.

And that because of MicroStrategy’s large BTC holding, they “see MSTR as an attractive vehicle for investors looking to gain Bitcoin exposure.”</p><p>Significant near term catalysts for the price of Bitcoin to rise include the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF by the SEC, development of the Lightning Network, potential FASB / GAAP accounting changes with respect to Bitcoin holdings, and the upcoming bitcoin halving in less than a year, according to the investment bank.</p><p>The report is bullish on the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin, joining many other firms in saying it’s a matter of “when” rather than “whether” one will eventually get approved by the SEC. TD Cowen’s Washington policy expert Jaret Seiberg wrote in a report earlier this month stating “we view approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF as inevitable.”</p><p>TD Cowen wrote “Bitcoin could ultimately represent a superior store of value relative to all other forms of money, whether fiat, metal -based, or digital, we believe.” The report describes Bitcoin’s properties of durability, portability, fungibility, verifiable, divisibility, and scarcity, establishing history, and censorship resistance as reasoning for this.</p><p>Bitcoin is relatively new, only being around since 2009. Despite this small amount of established history in comparison to gold or the dollar, TD Cowen believes that Bitcoin “has weathered enough trials in the market to suggest a high likelihood it will not vanish as a valued asset any time soon.” They predict that the asset will only grow stronger due to the lindy effect, meaning the longer Bitcoin can stay in existence, the more confidence society will have in it that it will continue to exist.</p><p>If Bitcoin is to take over and exceed the $17 trillion gold stocks market, it would put the price of BTC at around $800,000, in 2023 dollar terms of purchasing power, the report says.</p><p>As more adoption of Bitcoin happens and demand increases, TD Cowen predicts, in the short term, an upside scenario where the price of BTC appreciates 127% to around just above it's all time high at $70,000. But if regulators continue cracking down on the asset class, they predict a downside scenario of another crash back to $15,000.</p><p>Despite what many big firms have negatively reported on Bitcoin mining and its energy consumption, TD Cowen stated that “Bitcoin mining is in our opinion one of the most efficient, cleanest industrial uses of electricity and is improving its energy efficiency at a faster rate than most other industries.” The investment bank detailed that “simple economics – rather than government dictate – are driving bitcoin miners to the lowest -cost sources of energy.”</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk4NzgwODE5OTI5MjQ1MDM1/single-bitcoin.jpg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sazmining Establishes Sustainable Bitcoin Mining Facility In Paraguay]]></title><description><![CDATA[Sazmining powers sustainable Bitcoin mining in Paraguay with renewable energy.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/sazmining-establishes-sustainable-bitcoin-mining-facility-in-paraguay</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/sazmining-establishes-sustainable-bitcoin-mining-facility-in-paraguay</guid><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Paraguay]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sazmining]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Nik Hoffman]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jul 2023 17:34:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgyMDU1MzM0OTMwNTU2MjMy/bitcoin-green-mining.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.sazmining.com/">Sazmining</a>, a hosted <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/bitcoin-mining">Bitcoin mining</a> provider committed to 100% renewable energy, has set its sights on South America with the establishment of a new facility in Paraguay.

It’s usually mandated by governments, but this isn’t always the case. The currencies we use for everyday transactions in the modern era are all examples of fiat money, such as the U.S. dollar (USD), the euro (EUR), the pound (GBP) or the Chinese Yuan (CNY).</p><p>Fiat money is tender not backed by a tangible asset or commodity like gold or silver. It’s usually mandated by governments, but this isn’t always the case. The currencies we use for everyday transactions in the modern era are all examples of fiat money, such as the U.S. dollar (USD), the euro (EUR), the pound (GBP) or the Chinese Yuan (CNY).</p><p>The term “fiat” is a Latin word that means “by decree” or “let it be done,” representing an arbitrary order that reflects the issuance of money as a government enactment. Fiat is one <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-money#:~:text=Money%20assumes%20various%20forms%2C%20spanning,are%20distributed%20by%20the%20government.">form of money</a>, along with representative and commodity money. While fiat money comes in various forms — physical banknotes, coins or digital units — representative money merely “represents” an intent to pay, like a cheque. Commodity money has an intrinsic value derived from the commodity it is made of; for example, precious metals, food and even cigarettes.</p><h3>How Fiat Money Works</h3><p>The currency itself has no intrinsic value but derives its worth from trust in the government that issues it; it is not representative of another asset like gold, silver or any other financial instrument.</p><p><strong>Government Decree</strong>: Fiat money is declared by the government to be the official currency of a country and is typically designated as legal tender. This means that banks and financial institutions must adjust their systems to allow the currency to be accepted as a form of payment for goods, services and debts within a given country. There are some exceptions to this rule, with <a href="https://www.cashmatters.org/blog/brief-history-scotlands-legal-tender">Scotland being the prime example</a>.</p><p><strong>Legal Status</strong>: Whereby the new money is given the status of legal tender, meaning it must be accepted as payment within the country. Laws and regulations are established to ensure the proper functioning of fiat money. These regulations cover issues such as counterfeiting, fraud and the overall stability of the financial system.</p><p><strong>Acceptance and Trust</strong>: The value of fiat money is based on the belief and trust that it can be exchanged for goods and services and the illusion that it will retain its value over time. The general acceptance of fiat money by the public and its use in everyday transactions are crucial for its functioning. Should the majority recognize the power of compounding inflation, they may begin to lose confidence in the government’s money. </p><p><strong>Central Bank Control</strong>: Central banks are responsible for maintaining the stability and integrity of the currency. They control and monitor the supply of base money and adjust it based on economic conditions and monetary policy goals. By managing the money supply, central banks aim to maintain price stability and promote economic growth.</p><p>Central banks have the authority to influence the value of fiat money through monetary policy tools. They do so by adjusting interest rates, adjusting lending conditions and through new money creation.</p><p>In extreme circumstances, central banks need to issue money to ensure that there is an adequate flow of coins and notes to allow the economy to function properly. In addition to this, cash, which in reality represents a small part of the total amount of money circulating in an economy, a second layer of money issued by commercial banks is injected into the economy in the form of bank deposits that are available at any moment. </p><p>When the government creates new money and increases the money supply, inflationary pressure arises, which is a typical state of fiat systems. Although rare, extreme conditions known as “hyperinflation” may also emerge, resulting in the currency losing value or becoming worthless.</p><h2>How is Fiat Money Created? </h2><p>Governments and central banks have several methods for creating new money and inflating the current supply. The most common methods employed are:</p><p><strong>Fractional Reserve Banking</strong>: Commercial banks are required to maintain only a fraction of the deposits they receive as reserves. This reserve requirement enables banks to create new money by lending out a portion of the deposits. For example, if the reserve requirement is 10%, a bank can lend out 90% of the deposited amount. Once the loaned out money becomes deposits for other banks which, in turn, hold back 10% and lend out the other 81%; new money is created. </p><p><strong>Open Market Operations</strong>: Central banks, such as the Federal Reserve in the United States, can create money through open market operations. They purchase securities, such as government bonds, from banks and financial institutions. When the central bank buys these bonds, it pays for them by crediting the accounts of the sellers with new money. As a result, the money supply increases.</p><p><strong>Quantitative Easing (QE)</strong>: Quantitative Easing and Open Market Operations are technically the same thing. The difference being that QE began in 2008 and is much larger in scale than regular OMOs and have specific macroeconomic targets to do with growth, activity and lending. </p><p>QE is therefore typically used in times of economic crisis or when interest rates are already low. In this approach, the central bank creates new money electronically and uses it to purchase government bonds or other financial assets from the market.</p><p>Direct Government Spending: Governments can also release new money by simply spending it into the economy. When the government spends on public projects, infrastructure or social programs, it effectively injects new money into circulation.</p><h2>Characteristics Of Fiat Money</h2><p>In such a context, three main characteristics are recognized as specific to fiat money, and they are the following:</p><ul><li>Lack of intrinsic value because it is not backed by a commodity or any other type of financial instrument.</li></ul><ul><li>Establishment by government decree, and the government also controls the currency supply.</li></ul><ul><li>Trust and confidence as the basis of value. Individuals and businesses must trust that fiat money maintains its value and acceptability as a medium of exchange.</li></ul><h3>Historical Context and Evolution</h3><h4>7th Century — China</h4><p>The Chinese Song dynasty was the first to issue paper money, the Jiaozi, around the 10th century C.E., although the very first banknote-type instrument was used in the 7th century, during the Tang dynasty (618-907). During this era, merchants would issue some form of receipt of deposit to wholesalers to avoid using the heavy bulk of copper coinage in large commercial transactions.</p><p>During the Yuan dynasty in the 13th century, paper currency started being used as a predominant medium of exchange, as was also mentioned by Marco Polo in “The Travels of Marco Polo.” </p><h4>17th Century — New France</h4><p>In the Canadian colony of New France, the official beaver pelt started to be replaced as a medium of exchange by French coins in the 17th century. These coins soon became scarce as France reduced its circulation in the colonies. When local authorities began having a severe shortage of money, they had to become creative to pay military expedition soldiers, who had to be remunerated to avoid the risks of mutiny.</p><p>Playing cards started being used as paper money to represent gold and silver. They became widely accepted by merchants in the colonies until they were recognized as an official medium of exchange. People did not redeem them and instead used them for payments while gold and silver were hoarded. Therefore gold and silver were valued for their <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/store-of-value">store of value</a> properties while playing cards utility centered around convenience and risk minimization, an example of the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/what-is-nakamoto-greshams-law#:~:text=Only%20once%20their%20basic%20needs,sophisticated%20needs%20in%20the%20future.">Nakamoto-Gresham’s Law</a> in action. When rapid inflation occurred due to the high costs of the Seven Years’ War, paper money lost nearly all its value in an event that could be considered the first-ever recorded hyperinflation.</p><h4>18th Century — France</h4><p>During the French Revolution, facing incumbent national bankruptcy, the Constituent Assembly issued a paper currency called “assignats,” backed by the value of the properties confiscated from the crown and the Catholic Church. </p><p>By 1790, assignats were declared legal tender and went through phases of new issuance with the idea that they would be burned at the same rate that the lands securing them were sold. Lower denominations were produced in large numbers in order to ensure wide circulation. However, while such measures were meant to stimulate the economy, they also increased inflationary pressures and led the assignats to continuously lose value. </p><p>By 1793, the political situation had precipitated with the outbreak of the war and the fall of the monarchy. The Law of Maximum — that had set price limits and punished price gouging to ensure continuous food supply to Paris — was lifted which caused assignats to lose almost all value (hyperinflate) in the following months. </p><p>In the aftermath Napoleon opposed the implementation of any other form of fiat currency and the assignats became memorabilia.</p><h4>18th to 20th century</h4><p>The transition from commodity to fiat money could be established over these two centuries. WWI, the interwar period and WWII marked profound turbulence and economic crisis worldwide, with many countries facing high debt levels and widespread unemployment. During World War I, the British government issued war bonds to finance its war efforts. </p><p>These were essentially loans taken from the public, with the promise of repayment with interest after the war. Such <a href="https://bankunderground.co.uk/2017/08/08/your-country-needs-funds-the-extraordinary-story-of-britains-early-efforts-to-finance-the-first-world-war/">war bonds were only one-third subscribed</a>, which led to the creation of “unbacked” money. Many other nations followed suit and applied the same measures to finance their own war efforts.</p><p>The Bretton Woods monetary system agreed upon in 1944 was established to provide stability in international financial transactions and promote economic growth. The U.S. dollar was denominated as the global reserve currency and linked other major currencies to the dollar through fixed exchange rates. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank were also founded to facilitate international monetary cooperation and provide financial assistance to member countries.</p><p>In 1971, U.S. President Richard Nixon announced a series of economic measures that became known as the Nixon shock. The most impactful of these measures was the cancellation of the direct convertibility of the U.S. dollar to gold, which effectively ended the Bretton Woods system. </p><p>The Nixon shock marked a shift towards a floating exchange rate system, where currencies fluctuate freely based on supply and demand. It had significant implications for global currency markets, the international monetary system and the price of all goods and services. (Some of these distortions can be viewed on the website <a href="https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/">wtfhappenedin1971.com</a>.)</p><h3>The Transition From The Gold Standard To Fiat Money</h3><p>The gold standard was the monetary system prior to WWI, where a country’s currency was backed by gold. Governments held significant gold reserves to back their currencies, and individuals could exchange their paper money for gold at a fixed rate. This system provided stability and confidence in the currency’s value, as it was directly linked to a tangible asset.</p><p>From the start of WWI there was gradually a transition from the gold standard to fiat money, where currencies were no longer backed by a specific quantity of gold but instead derived their value from government regulation and public trust.</p><p>Various factors led to the shift in the monetary system, including the need for a more flexible monetary policy to address economic challenges effectively. The gold standard limited governments’ ability to control the money supply, interest rates and exchange rates, as they were tied to fixed gold convertibility. Furthermore, the initially decentralized commodity was difficult to transport, store and secure, so it became centralized by goldsmiths and later banks, leaving its fate subject to the whims of governments. </p><p>By the late 20th century, most countries had fully adopted fiat monetary systems. Governments and central banks took responsibility for managing the money supply, setting interest rates and attempting to stabilize their respective economies, although a long-term economic security could never be guaranteed. </p><h2>Fiat Money In The Global Economy</h2><h3>The Role Of Central Banks</h3><p>In the global fiat monetary system, the role of central banks is crucial in the implementation of monetary policy. They use various tools — such as setting interest rates — to influence economic conditions, stabilize prices and promote economic growth. </p><p>They are generally responsible for issuing and managing the national currency, regulating the money supply, ensuring the availability of an adequate quantity of currency and maintaining its integrity and stability. However, through manipulating rates and the money supply, central banks have profound influences on people and business, making it hard to plan for the future.</p><p>Central banks often have the authority to supervise and regulate commercial banks and other financial institutions within their jurisdiction. They set prudential regulations, conduct bank examinations and oversee the stability and safety of the banking system to help maintain financial stability and protect depositors and consumers.</p><p>They also act as lenders of last resort to provide liquidity and emergency funding to banks and financial institutions that may face financial distress or liquidity shortages. </p><h3>Impact On International Trade And Exchange Rates</h3><p>As a national currency, the fiat dollar significantly impacts international trade and exchange rates, being the most widely accepted medium of exchange that facilitates the buying and selling of goods and services between countries. Its ease of use simplifies transactions and promotes economic integration across borders.</p><p>Furthermore, exchange rates reflect the value of one currency relative to another and are influenced by a range of factors, including interest rates, inflation rates, economic conditions and market forces. Changes in exchange rates impact the competitiveness of exports and imports, influencing trade flows and the balance of payments.</p><h3>Fiat Money And Economic Crises</h3><p>Fiat money systems are susceptible to economic crises due to excessive money creation, poor fiscal management or financial market imbalances. Unsustainable policies can lead to inflation, currency devaluation and asset bubbles, resulting in economic downturns and crises. </p><p>To face such consequences, central banks take measures such as lowering interest rates and increasing the money supply to stimulate economic growth during a downturn. While these measures can boost economic activity and asset prices, they can also lead to speculative bubbles and unsustainable expansion. When these bubbles burst, they can trigger recessions and sometimes depressions. </p><p><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-hyperinflation">Hyperinflations</a> are rare, but they have occurred in some cases of fiscal mismanagement, political instability or severe economic disruptions — notable examples include Weimar Germany in the 1920s, Zimbabwe in the 2000s and more recently, Venezuela. Hyperinflation is a fiat phenomenon that occurs when prices increase by 50% within one month. </p><p>Throughout history, it has occurred “only” 65 times, according to the Hanke-Krus research; however, it should not be underestimated as its consequences have been catastrophic and have destroyed countries’ economies and societies in the past.</p><h2>Properties Of Fiat Money</h2><p>Fiat money is excellent for everyday transactions, but it’s a poor store of value compared to commodity money like gold. Whether fiat is better than gold is subjective, and in some respects, it is. However, it has introduced its drawbacks as it scores poorly against critical properties such as scarcity, which many would argue is a fatal flaw.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk5NjU3NDI1OTc0OTk0NTYw/currency-properties.png" height="349" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><h3>Pros Of Fiat Money</h3><p>The implementation of fiat money has produced some advantages, especially in relation to gold, as highlighted here: </p><ul><li>Ease of use: Fiat money is more practical for everyday transactions due to its portability, divisibility and broader acceptance. It is convenient for a range of economic activities, from small purchases to large commercial transactions.</li><li>Lower costs and risks: It eliminates the costs and risks associated with storing and securing physical commodities like gold. It reduces the need for acquiring and safeguarding large gold reserves.</li></ul><h4>Pros for Governments</h4><ul><li>Greater flexibility in monetary policy: Governments and central banks can adjust the money supply, interest rates and exchange rates to respond to economic conditions and promote stability. This flexibility enables them to mitigate economic downturns, control inflation and manage currency fluctuations, which are notable features of the fiat system.</li><li>Prevention of gold drain: Government measures to safeguard their gold reserves and prevent the outflow of gold from the country become unnecessary. Maintaining an adequate supply of gold was crucial for the currency’s stability under the gold standard. </li><li>Sovereign control: Fiat money offers governments and central banks greater flexibility in managing monetary policy to address economic challenges and promote stability. They can adjust interest rates, control the money supply and handle exchange rates to respond to economic conditions and promote stability. </li></ul><h3>Cons Of Fiat Money</h3><p>Even though fiat money has widespread drawbacks, it became the predominant form of money globally primarily due to advantages in terms of flexibility, convenience and adaptability to complex economic systems. However, maintaining effective monetary governance and ensuring trust and confidence in the currency are critical to mitigate the potential disadvantages associated with fiat money.</p><ol><li>Inflationary and hyperinflationary risks: Fiat money systems are vulnerable to inflationary pressures and have been the cause of all hyperinflations in history. The prices of goods and services are forever increasing in fiat systems, but it’s due to the value of currency units decreasing. </li><li>Lack or loss of intrinsic value: Unlike commodity-based money like gold, fiat money does not have inherent or intrinsic value. Its value is derived solely from the trust and confidence placed in the issuing government and the stability of the monetary system. This reliance on trust can make fiat money susceptible to loss of confidence during economic or political uncertainty.</li><li>Centralized control, government dependence and manipulation: Fiat money systems are subject to centralized control by governments and central banks. Allowing flexibility in monetary policy opens the way for manipulation and mismanagement. Poor policy decisions, political interference and lack of transparency can lead to misallocation of resources, currency devaluation and financial instability. Centralized entities are also inclined to use censorship and confiscation.</li><li>Counterparty risk: Fiat money relies on the credibility and stability of the issuing government. In cases where governments face economic or political challenges, there is a risk of default or loss of confidence in the currency. This can lead to currency devaluation, capital departure or even currency crises.</li><li>Potential for abuse and corruption: Systems can be susceptible to abuse and corruption, mainly when there is a lack of transparency and accountability in monetary management. Unscrupulous practices, such as money laundering, illicit transactions or political manipulation of the money supply, can undermine the currency’s integrity and erode public trust. Such approaches may produce the Cantillon effect, where changes in an economy’s money supply cause the redistribution of purchasing power among people, altering the relative prices of goods and services which results in the misallocation of scarce resources.</li></ol><p>Read More >> <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/fiat-money-has-broken-the-world">How Fiat Money Broke The World</a></p><h2>The End Game</h2><h3>Limitations Of Fiat In The Modern Age</h3><p>It could be argued that fiat once served a purpose as gold failed to meet the postwar world’s demands. Similarly, current conditions indicate that we are reaching another inflection point, whereby fiat is no longer equipped for the digital age. </p><p>Even though fiat has digitized financial transactions, the reliance on digital platforms and systems introduces cybersecurity risks. Hackers and cybercriminals tend to target digital infrastructure and government databases, attempting to breach security measures, steal sensitive information or carry out fraudulent activities. These risks threaten the integrity of digital fiat money systems and the trust placed in them. </p><p>Privacy constitutes another concern. Online fiat money transactions leave a digital trail, raising apprehension about privacy and surveillance. Collecting and using personal financial data can produce privacy risks and potentially misuse sensitive information. </p><p>Artificial Intelligence and bots present yet another challenge, which could be solved by introducing private keys and microtransaction fees. Without addressing such challenges, the fiat system will be left behind with new online publishing monetization opportunities that are moving beyond the traditional advertising model.</p><p>Furthermore, fiat cannot sustain the extreme efficiency that code-driven digital currencies can provide, including quick settlement. Centralized systems will always rely on intermediaries to approve transactions that must go through different layers of authorizations before being confirmed, sometimes taking days or weeks to resolve. Bitcoin transactions can take as little as 10 minutes to become irreversible.</p><h3>The Rise Of Bitcoin</h3><p>Besides its transaction finality, bitcoin offers several advantages over fiat in the digital age. Decentralization, SHA-256 encryption and the proof-of-work consensus mechanism combine to create an immutable ledger. Its limited supply makes it inflation-proof, the perfect store of value and medium of exchange, as it appreciates sufficiently to be adopted as a unit of account.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Bitcoin is smart money, programmable, not confiscatable and has all the properties that make it the ideal asset to save and an excellent medium of exchange for merchants who want quick settlements.</p><p>Moreover, being a digital currency, bitcoin possesses an optimal capability to leverage the efficiency of AI for tasks like fraud detection and risk assessments within its services. It encompasses the advantageous characteristics of gold, such as its limited supply, while also embodying the divisible and portable nature of fiat currency. Furthermore, it introduces novel properties tailored to suit the requirements of the digital era.</p><p>In the coming years the transition from fiat money to bitcoin will represent the next evolution of money. The two monetary systems will co-exist for the time necessary for the world’s population to adapt to the best money humanity has ever experienced. In the meantime, we will likely continue to spend our national currencies and store bitcoin, as bitcoin has the necessary properties to <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/store-of-value">store value</a> through time. This will continue until the value of Bitcoin far exceeds the value of national currencies, upon which time merchants will refuse to accept the inferior money. </p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>How Does Fiat Money Differ From Commodity Money?</h3><p>Fiat money is based on trust in the government; commodity money is backed by a physical asset like gold.</p><h3>What Currencies Are Not Fiat?</h3><p>Currently, all currencies being used by governments are fiat currencies. El Salvador is the exception, as it has implemented a dual currency system of bitcoin and fiat. </p><h3>What Factors Can Affect The Value Of Fiat Money?</h3><p>Some examples include a lack of trust in the government that issues currency, uncontrolled money printing, unsustainable monetary policies set up by central banks and political (in)stability.</p><p>How Do Central Banks Regulate The Value Of Fiat Money?</p><p>Through interest rate adjustments, open market operations like buying or selling government securities (bonds) in the open market and reserve requirements for banks. Capital controls to manage currency volatility, maintain stability or prevent excessive inflows or outflows of funds could disrupt the domestic economy and impact the value of fiat money.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk5NjU3NDYzNTU1ODI3MzI4/fiat-money-feature-image-w_text.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk5NjU3NDI1OTc0OTk0NTYw/currency-properties.png" height="349" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk5NjU3NDQzNjkxNjAzMDQ3/unnamed.png" height="349" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Human Rights Foundation Announces 20 BTC Bounty Challenge For Bitcoin Development]]></title><description><![CDATA[The HRF Bitcoin Bounty Challenge, with a 20 BTC total reward pool, has officially launched, with a focus on transactional privacy and Bitcoin self-sovereignty development.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/human-rights-foundation-announces-20-btc-bounty-challenge-for-bitcoin-development</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/human-rights-foundation-announces-20-btc-bounty-challenge-for-bitcoin-development</guid><category><![CDATA[BTC]]></category><category><![CDATA[human rights foundation]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[bitcoin development]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Mark Goodwin]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jul 2023 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk5NjYzNDMzMDIzNDk3ODU2/hrf-logomark_1000x1000.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In what is perhaps the most articulate and thorough Bitcoin grant offering to date, the <a href="https://hrf.org/">Human Rights Foundation</a> (HRF) has announced a 20 BTC set of bounty challenges in support of open-source Bitcoin developers building tools and services that increase the functionality of Bitcoin. These selections, inspired by the HRF’s research and work with activists across the world, were carefully chosen to perpetuate usability and increase privacy applications within Bitcoin, the Lightning Network, ecash and Nostr. </p><p>The challenges will run through the end of 2024, with any unclaimed bounties being converted back into the HRF’s Bitcoin Development Fund. The bounties themselves have a clear privacy, censorship-resistance, and self-sovereignty focus, bringing much needed attention towards some of the greater problems Bitcoin faces today. </p><p>The first bounty is a 2 BTC reward to port the Bitcoin UI Kit to the open-source Penpot project from its current Figma file format. This kit is a large set of design components for builders to use when developing Bitcoin projects. In its current format, its use is limited to those operating proprietary software, and the HRF aims to sponsor the “replication of the Bitcoin UI Kit on Penpot,” actualizing free access and self-hosted instances. </p><p>The second bounty is a 2 BTC reward for a serverless implementation of a payjoin protocol. The bounty specifically calls for a “production-ready version 2 payjoin protocol which may send and receive Payjoin transactions without requiring a sender or recipient to operate a public server.” The Serverless Payjoin bounty asks for use of BIP-21 unified bitcoin URIs, and to remain independent from a trusted third party (hence serverless) which “could expose user privacy in a non-trivial way.” </p><p>The third bounty is another 2 BTC reward for the creation of a Nostr client implementation of end to end encrypted group chats which is incapable of leaking metadata to potentially malicious third parties. In order to be eligible, the group chat must enable three or more users to communicate, with no ability for outside adversaries to gather the content of the messages, nor the identity or frequency of the users messaging. </p><p>The fourth bounty is a 2 BTC reward for a mobile Bitcoin wallet capable of receiving and sending Silent Payments without the use of a client-side full node. The wallet must be open-source and multi-platform, with a backend that is interoperable with other mobile wallets. The bounty asks for compliance with the <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1458">Silent Payments BIP</a>, written by&nbsp;Ruben Somsen and&nbsp;Josie Bake.</p><p>The fifth bounty, a 2 BTC reward for Human Readable Offers, calls for a bolt 12 offer generator to be integrated into a mobile wallet. Ideally, a bolt 12 offer could be communicated from a phone screen to a human without the use of copy and paste or a QR code scan, similar to how a Bitcoin or Lightning address is displayed.</p><p>The sixth bounty is a 2 BTC reward for a Lightning address generator within a mobile wallet that is self-custodial and accessible with just a smart phone. This implementation “should not require the user to set up their own web server.” </p><p>The seventh bounty is a 2 BTC reward for a mobile integration of border wallet functionality into a current Bitcoin wallet. The idea of a border wallet is to allow users to generate and practice memorizing their seed phrase for moments of cross-jurisdictional movement. </p><p>The eighth bounty, a 2 BTC reward for easy multisig functionality, is aiming to bring coordinated 2-of-3 multi-signature usability and generation within a mobile wallet at the tap of a button. The bounty also mentions the mobile wallet must remain self-custodial, complete with an open-source method to recover funds beyond the multisig application itself. </p><p>The ninth bounty is a 2 BTC reward for a self-custodial wallet implementation powered by<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/852.pdf"> FROST</a>, or flexible round-optimal Schnorr threshold signatures. This dynamic multisig protocol must allow for modification of the signer set without transferring the funds to a different address. </p><p>The tenth and final bounty is a 2 BTC reward for the ecash protocol, Cashu. This bounty, unlike the others, is split up into four 0.5 BTC bounties, with specific requirements for further applications of this open-source Chaumian ecash system. Bounty A calls for an iOS Cashu app, while Bounty B calls for an Android Cashu app, both requiring a fully functioning, open-source wallet with the capability to support multiple mints, use seed phrase backups for fund recovery, as well as send and receive ecash over Nostr. Bounty C aims to bring to life an open-source Cashu web widget capable of enabling anonymous payments for paywalled content, capable of interacting with a user’s bitcoin address. The final bounty, Bounty D, is a half bitcoin reward for actualizing Cashu-TS backup restore, Cashu-TS being a popular Cashu wallet library for application development. Users must be able to restore balances across various implementations of Cashu in order to provide security of users via a seed phrase back up scheme akin to how most users back up their bitcoin wallet.</p><p>The HRF stated that this is an "initial set” of 10 bitcoin challenges, and more bounties may be added as time goes on. The team or individual developer who “fully solves” any of the Bitcoin bounty challenges will be eligible to receive the 2 BTC bounty. All eligible submissions will be discussed among external industry experts in order to select the submission best meeting the requirements of their challenge. </p><p>Individuals and parties interested in participating are asked to contact <a href="mailto:bounty@hrf.org">bounty@hrf.org</a> with any question, and more details about the bounties can be found <a href="http://www.hrfbounties.org">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk5NjYzNDMzMDIzNDk3ODU2/hrf-logomark_1000x1000.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Institutional Bitcoin Products Will Drive Demand Ahead Of The Next Halving]]></title><description><![CDATA[As financial firms look to offer bitcoin products ahead of the upcoming halving, they are poised to capitalize on increasing demand.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/institutional-bitcoin-products-price-impact-ahead-of-halving</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/institutional-bitcoin-products-price-impact-ahead-of-halving</guid><category><![CDATA[Halving]]></category><category><![CDATA[ETF]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Deutsche Bank]]></category><category><![CDATA[Markets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Blackrock]]></category><category><![CDATA[Institutional Adoption]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Marc Taverner]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jul 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzMzUxMjcwOTg2MTY0MTMx/big-bank.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Marc Taverner, CEO of XEROF, a digital-asset-focused financial services provider.</em></p><p>At long last, we’re entering the era of bitcoin financial products. After <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/industry-events/bitcoin-2021-elusive-bitcoin-etf">several attempts at regulatory approval from numerous financial firms</a>, players like <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/the-arrival-of-blackrock-bitcoins-first-spot-etf">BlackRock may finally get their U.S. bitcoin ETF approved</a>, while global firms like <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/06/20/deutsche-bank-applies-for-digital-asset-license-in-germany-as-tradfi-pushes-further-into-crypto/">Deutsche Bank are seeking their own crypto licenses</a>. </p><p>These institutional movers could be looking to hold bitcoin on their balance sheets ahead of the next halving. But make no mistake: I believe their larger play is to develop financial products for accredited investors and their “normal” customers to access bitcoin. </p><p>It’s important to note here that I said “financial products.” They are unlikely to pursue these licenses and approvals only to make it possible for their customers to buy bitcoin directly. This is for several reasons, all of which I hear regularly in my work as a licensed digital asset provider in Switzerland. Here’s why these large banks, investment firms, family offices, etc., won’t just “buy bitcoin.”</p><h2>Why Financial Firms Won’t Buy Bitcoin For Their Balance Sheets</h2><p>First, most customers don’t know how to open or manage their own bitcoin wallets. By “customers,” we’re not just referring to retail customers, but also to sophisticated money managers and institutions. Wallets are still an unforgiving and complex element of bitcoin management. Offering direct bitcoin purchases at scale requires infrastructure and education that these institutions are behind in cultivating. Not to mention that they would need to compete with the established dominance and captive market of companies like Coinbase.</p><p>Second, financial firms won’t be investing in bitcoin directly because holding the asset itself securely (unless you have a dedicated bitcoin security team) is hard to manage. And that is before they consider how to manage it for thousands or millions of customers. Holding direct bitcoin in wallets makes their institution a target for hackers, criminals or internal bad actors. I have seen an influx of consultancies helping these institutions create their own highly-secure cold storage processes and procedures. However, like the bank heist movies tell us, no system is completely immune to infiltration.</p><p>Third, buying bitcoin could reflect a “loss” of assets under management (AUM). If these institutions were to help their family offices or wealth managers directly buy bitcoin, that is no longer an asset they “manage.” This amount of AUM is a critical metric for banks, investment managers and other institutions. In contrast, by creating products, they would remain in management control.</p><p>The fourth reason relates to fee structure. Financial products bring convenience and also make it easier for the institution creating the product to make money. The next wave of bitcoin investors won’t be actively trading (so, there won’t be exchange fees), they’ll be buying and HODLing alongside their larger portfolio. How can you make your fees if bitcoin doesn’t move accounts? By charging a percentage fee of AUM.</p><p>Fifth, and perhaps most importantly: The upcoming halving will slice the supply of bitcoin itself, which based on the past, will be outmatched by demand. The current price of bitcoin, approximately $29,000 at the time of writing, has not yet built in the effects of the halving, but I’m sure it will and I fully expect the price to rise above $100,000 after the halving. And at that point, demand will increase. </p><h2>How The Next Halving Changes Things</h2><p>Investors and institutions wishing to capitalize on this opportunity will see lower bitcoin liquidity, 50% to be exact, which will increase competition for access to this limited resource. They will do what they’ve done in years past: look to invest in privately-held and publicly-listed Bitcoin miners or use a Bitcoin financial vehicle. </p><p>When I worked at European bitcoin miner Bitfury, we saw this influx of interest every four years as the halving drove up demand and prices and watched it wane as the price steadied itself to match demand. </p><p>But this coming halving, only the fourth ever, will be different. If any ETF manages to be approved by then, it will join the ranks of other bitcoin financial products (like Europe’s ETPs and active-managed certificates), which will see their star power rise alongside bitcoin demand. </p><p>I’d like to note that the Bitcoin halvings have always represented economic opportunity. Twelve months after the first halving, the price of bitcoin had <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/learn/bitcoin-halving-how-does-the-halving-cycle-work-and-why-does-it-matter#:~:text=On%20Nov.,to%20%242%2C550%20by%20July%202017.">increased by over 9,000%</a> when rewards dropped from 50 to 25. Similar surges in price were seen following the second and third halvings as well. Still, without corresponding, easy and low-friction avenues to access bitcoin (besides buying bitcoin or investing in miners), the price didn’t fully reflect its increasing scarcity. Now, with greater awareness and easier/lower friction methods to access bitcoin, I believe it will.</p><p>So, why celebrate these entrants if they’re just adding layers of complexity and their pricing structure to what is already a stupendous asset? Because it’s great for the bitcoin price. More Bitcoin financial products mean more people (including people with a lot of money) can confidently access bitcoin. </p><p>The rise of bitcoin and its sister products is a significant victory. After years of persistence, we have convinced even the most skeptical that a lack of bitcoin reflects a weaker portfolio and an even weaker understanding of digital wealth.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Marc Taverner.

This development coincides with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_shock#:~:text=The%20Nixon%20shock%20was%20a,international%20convertibility%20of%20the%20United">the "Nixon shock" of August 15, 1971</a>, when U.S. President Richard Nixon announced that the United States would end the convertibility of the U.S. dollar into gold. <br><br>Since then, central banks around the world have started operating a <a href="https://history.state.gov/milestones/1969-1976/nixon-shock">fiat-based monetary system</a> with floating exchange rates and no real currency standard at all. <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL">The money supply has been rising steadily ever since</a>. As a result, real estate has become so valuable because it serves the world as the primary asset to <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/store-of-value">store value</a> and protect wealth from resulting inflation. <a href="https://businessday.ng/business-economy/article/two-reasons-real-estate-is-worlds-most-preferred-store-of-wealth/#:~:text=Over%2067%20percent%20of%20the">Around 67% of global wealth</a> <a href="https://www.onceinaspecies.com/p/bitcoins-full-potential-valuation?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share">(with some estimates putting the figure at $330 trillion)</a> is stored in real estate. </p><p>In the past, people owned real estate for its utility value, which is characterized by the fact that you can live in it or use it for production. However, today, most people, especially wealthy individuals and institutions, own real estate to store value. In addition, <a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2019/december/primer-negative-interest-rates">from about 2008 to 2022, there has been a low to negative interest rate policy around the world</a>, which has prompted investors to withdraw their savings from the bank and invest them. </p><p>But even more recently, macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds have exposed the weakness of real estate as a physical store of value and demonstrated the benefits of bitcoin as a digital store of value.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Physical Vs. Digital Stores Of Value</h2><p>Some of the benefits of using bitcoin as a store of value became evident in Ukraine last year. After the escalation of the Ukrainian-Russian conflict on <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20230214-february-24-2022-the-day-russia-invaded-ukraine">February 24, 2022</a>, some Ukrainians<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/23/ukrainian-flees-to-poland-with-2000-in-bitcoin-on-usb-drive.html"> turned to Bitcoin to protect their wealth</a> as they fled their homes. Real estate, on the other hand, would have had to be left behind. In German, real estate translates to “<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=german+word+for+real+estate&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS997US997&oq=german+word+for+real+estate&aqs=chrome..69i57j33i160j33i671l5.2422j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">immobilie</a>,” which literally means “to be immobile.” Owning real estate creates a local dependency that can pose a problem in a world of ever-increasing conflict and radicalization. </p><p>What do you do when war breaks out? You can't take real estate with you. This may sound like a dystopia to some, but if you are serious about long-term wealth management, you should consider the worst-case scenario. The fear of a third world war, in whatever form, is not at all illogical. Who would have thought that there would be war in Europe as we see today? Perhaps we are already in the middle of World War III. Real estate is not only difficult to move or liquidate in times of crisis, it is also expensive to maintain, easy to destroy, tax and confiscate. I will go into more detail about that in a moment.</p><p>Bitcoin, on the other hand, is relatively easy and cheap to maintain. You don’t have to worry about daily maintenance, rent or repairs in the way you do with real estate and can self-custody your bitcoin.</p><p>Bitcoin is a digital commodity, one does not have to worry that it will be destroyed in the event of war. It is digital information. <a href="https://twitter.com/DocumentingBTC/status/1650152272670728196">Bitcoin is more powerful than the top-500 supercomputers in the world combined</a>. The internet is at greater risk of collapsing than the Bitcoin network and our bank accounts are at greater risk of being hacked than Bitcoin, which is <a href="https://twitter.com/epodrulz/status/1655542080456871938?s=20">more secure than any other digital infrastructure</a> that has ever existed due to its decentralization.</p><h3>Taxation </h3><p>Totalitarian states use taxation to oppress minorities, dissidents and ethnic groups. “<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judensteuer">Judensteuer</a>” or “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judenverm%C3%B6gensabgabe">Judenvermögensabgabe</a>,” for example, refers to various taxes or anti-Semitic levies to which Jews were subjected in Nazi Germany. These were used by the German state to deprive Jews of their livelihoods. In addition, <a href="https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/how-failing-banks-paved-hitlers-path-power-financial-crisis-and-right-wing-extremism">Germany had financial problems in the 1930s due to the high reparations that had to be paid to France after losing the first world war</a>. The wealth of German Jews was relatively easy prey for improving the German state budget. </p><p>When states face bankruptcy, they often begin to arbitrarily tax citizens. Tangible assets such as real estate are particularly easy to tax due to their physical natures. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is difficult to tax, due to its digital nature. Thus, it is hard for totalitarian states to steal bitcoin. Given the ever-present possibility of totalitarianism, conflict and the fatal consequences that these can have on our personal freedoms and prosperity, it is important to keep a significant portion of one's wealth in a sound and mobile digital asset such as bitcoin, rather than tangible assets like real estate that are costly to maintain, and easy to destroy, tax and confiscate. </p><h3>The Risk Of Confiscation</h3><p>I still remember very well the stories of the older Jews that I heard during the breaks in synagogue during my childhood in Hamburg, Germany — the horrors of the Holocaust and the constant fear of property confiscation and the associated inability to organize an escape or start a new life abroad. I remember one elderly gentleman in particular who proudly told me that he had diamonds in his molars in case he had to fly out of Germany again. These stories shaped me a lot and allowed me to understand the value of bitcoin.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>The fate of the Jews in Nazi Germany is a painful history lesson that teaches us the importance of property rights and the need to store wealth in a digital asset like bitcoin that is difficult to confiscate and easy to move or liquidate in times of crisis. Unfortunately, the repressions against Jews were not isolated cases in history. Property confiscation happens all the time. <a href="https://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1497&context=ilr">Many lost their property in Cuba when Fidel Castro took over</a>, as <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/microstrategy-ceo-michael-saylor-interview-the-predator-prey-dynamics-of-bitcoin">Michael Saylor likes to point out</a>.</p><p>“Seizing companies and seizing buildings is easy,” <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/microstrategy-ceo-michael-saylor-interview-the-predator-prey-dynamics-of-bitcoin">Saylor has said</a>. “It’s easy to nationalize an oil company. It’s easy to seize all the gold. It’s very difficult to seize passwords in people’s heads.”</p><p>In contrast, bitcoin is property that truly belongs to you. When stored in cold storage (offline), bitcoin are the holder’s alone and are not at risk of confiscation by third parties. In addition, little can stop you from selling or taking bitcoin with you. You are not dependent on lengthy, bureaucratic processes as with real estate transfers. In case you need to relocate, you just need to memorize 12 or 24 words, the backup (seed phrase) for your bitcoin wallet. You could escape a war zone, restore your bitcoin wallet with the backup and have access to your wealth again. This is truly revolutionary and a value proposition that will result in exponential demand for bitcoin and subsequent price increases due to <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-happens-bitcoin-after-21-million-mined/">bitcoin's fixed supply cap of 21,000,000</a>.<br></p><p>When demand increases and the supply remains near constant, as is the case with bitcoin, the price must increase, mathematically speaking. There is also the fact that there is not only a limited supply of bitcoin, but that there will be less bitcoin over time because as, for example, passwords are forgotten or people who own bitcoin are no longer able to access or transfer it for various reasons. Due to unpredictable technological advances, it could be possible to crack certain wallets in the future. However, not all bitcoin that are “lost” will be found.</p><p>Bitcoin serves as an excellent hedge against the threat of war, destruction, taxation and confiscation. It is easily portable, noncustodial, censorship resistant, divisible, durable and easy to move or liquidate in times of crisis. It is the ideal store of value. </p><h2>Bitcoin Is Digital Real Estate</h2><p>Bitcoin offers easy access to property, the ability to store value and build wealth — functions traditionally fulfilled by real estate. However, bitcoin fulfills these functions much better. Given bitcoin’s vastly superior properties as a store of value, it has the potential to absorb a significant portion of the monetary premium that real estate carries as a store of value today. Until now, bitcoin has largely been understood as an alternative to gold (<a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/gold/marketcap/#:~:text=Estimated%20Market%20Cap%3A%20%2413.011%20T,world's%20above%20ground%20gold%20reserves.">which has a market cap of $12.9 trillion</a>) due to its limited supply and excellent monetary properties. However, it is a direct competitor to the world's most used store of value, real estate, an asset with a market cap of $330 trillion. </p><p>If we assume that bitcoin will absorb 10% to 15% of the real estate market cap over the next few decades, it has the potential to become a $30 trillion to $50 trillion asset. That would mean $1.5 million to $2.3 million per bitcoin if the bitcoin supply were at its theoretical maximum of 21 million. </p><p>Nobody can predict the future, but this calculation should clarify what opportunities Bitcoin presents. It therefore makes sense for a real estate investor to get involved with Bitcoin at an early stage. It is well known that those who adopt new technologies first will benefit the most. </p><p>I've been a Bitcoiner for over 10 years. In 2012, during my philosophy studies, I heard about Bitcoin for the first time. In 2016, I started working full time in the real estate industry with a focus on project development, renovation and real estate management in a family office. For a long time I thought that real estate and Bitcoin didn't have much in common. However, this is not the case.</p><p>When <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrR95PFYDFQ">Saylor began speaking publicly about the Bitcoin strategies his company MicroStrategy is pursuing in late 2020</a>, I realized that I too need to think about how we can bring Bitcoin into our real estate business. It quickly became clear to me that bitcoin, as a store of value, is in competition with real estate, which is used as such. So, I came to the conclusion that real estate investors whose business is the acquisition and construction of physical property are destined to hold bitcoin, since it is digital property. This statement may surprise you, but who would have thought in 1995 that <a href="https://www.indigo9digital.com/blog/4-secrets-to-walmarts-ecommerce-sucess#:~:text=Walmart%20is%20now%20the%20second,eCommerce%20performance%20then%20read%20on.">many retail stores would eventually also have a digital business in the form of a website or e-commerce store</a>? Of course, e-commerce websites and retail stores are more alike than bitcoin and real estate are, but it's the best comparison to show the need for real estate investors to get involved with Bitcoin</p><p>In addition, bitcoin's price potential is significantly higher than that of real estate, which has already completed its adoption cycle as a store of value. As deflationary money, bitcoin can also support real estate developers in their core work of project development and maintenance, which are cost intensive. Construction cost and utilities increase with inflation. Bitcoin can help protect capital from inflation and thus position project developers for the future. Furthermore, the real estate industry is currently being plagued by geopolitical and macroeconomic issues. This is likely to increase in the future. Bitcoin offers a serious solution to build capital reserves outside of the turbulence of the existing financial system.</p><p>Consequently, for any real estate investor who is a rational market participant, the following questions should be asked: How can I accumulate as much bitcoin as possible as quickly as possible while it is still relatively cheap? And how can I add a Bitcoin strategy to my core business? </p><h2>Bitcoin Strategies For Real Estate Investors</h2><p>Based on my personal experience, I will outline four strategies for real estate investors to accumulate bitcoin. Which strategy you follow depends on your conviction, the size of the real estate portfolio you own, your experience and your risk tolerance. I will also explain how a Bitcoin strategy can potentially support real estate investors in their core businesses of property acquisition, construction and management.</p><h3>One: Use Some Of The Profits From Your Business To Buy Bitcoin</h3><p>Bitcoin's advantages over real estate in its function as a store of value should not distract from the profitable business of real estate development. I'm not asking you to stop developing real estate, I'm asking you to add a Bitcoin strategy. If you're running a successful real estate development business, it probably wouldn't be a good idea to stop overnight and focus all of your attention on Bitcoin, especially due to the high debt burden that real estate development brings with it and which must be paid back. Rental income from completed properties is necessary to pay down debt over time.<br><br>Bitcoin is a near-perfect store of value, but it does not generate income to pay off debts, for example. Speculating on bitcoin’s price increases to pay off debt incurred to build or purchase a property carries a lot of risk, because bitcoin is volatile and therefore not suitable for planning monthly interest payments. However, you can use part of your profits that you make from the real estate business to accumulate bitcoin. </p><p>How much is up to you, but 10% to 25% seems reasonable to participate in Bitcoin's exponential growth without impacting a core business. You would still have more than enough capital to continue your existing real estate business and meet all of your obligations, but also to buy bitcoin with enough capital to properly position yourself for the digitization of property. Many retail companies missed the leap into e-commerce and surely suffered significant business losses as a result. Real estate investors unwilling to delve into digital property (bitcoin) will face a similar fate. </p><h3>Two: Use Rental Income To Buy Bitcoin And Build Reserves</h3><p>If you bought real estate with the vision of holding it for the long term and living off of the cash flow, you <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/how-to-buy-bitcoin">can buy bitcoin</a> with the rental income from your real estate. On top of that, bitcoin is the perfect money to build maintenance reserves as it is disinflationary (meaning there will be less supply over time). </p><p>If the supply of a money remains almost constant or decreases and the demand increases over time, the price of the money increases. Demand for bitcoin will increase over time due to its exceptionally good monetary properties. This means that bitcoin gives you increased purchasing power in the long term, which can be used for maintenance and modernization measures, which are important in order to maintain the value of a property. </p><p>Given the high levels of monetary inflation in fiat currencies, simply holding the rental income in a bank account is not a sufficient strategy. Inflation will melt the value of your cash flow. In addition, regulation and ESG requirements will increasingly force property owners to “modernize” in the future, which is likely to continuously increase property maintenance costs over time. Bitcoin gives you the opportunity to prepare for this.</p><figure>

        <figcaption><em>Bitcoin maintenance reserves are a long-term treasury management strategy for real estate investors, outside of the uncertainty of the inflationary fiat system. </em><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/14-nervewracking-photos-from-high-atop-old-school-nyc-skyscrapers-photo-gallery-gothamist--586101339024351608/"><em>Source</em></a><em>.</em></figcaption>
    </figure><p>You can use various bitcoin-only service providers to buy bitcoin using rental income. In Europe, there are companies like <a href="https://relai.app/">Relai</a> and <a href="https://bitcoinreserve.com/">Bitcoin Reserve</a>, for example. In the U.S., you can use <a href="https://www.swanbitcoin.com/">Swan Bitcoin</a> and in Canada, <a href="https://www.bullbitcoin.com/">Bull Bitcoin</a>. I have personally had positive experiences with Relai. I have not used the other companies mentioned, but have heard good feedback from others. </p><p>However, you need to build and manage your bitcoin treasury<em> </em>with care. Bitcoin is very volatile. It's important to only convert part of your rental income into bitcoin (perhaps 5% to 20%) so that there are always enough liquid reserves to be able to service ongoing maintenance costs and outstanding debts. </p><p>Bitcoin maintenance reserves are a long-term treasury management strategy outside of the current uncertainty of the traditional banking system. I'm fed up with the behavior of most banks. Their services and opinions change with central bank interest rates (which change arbitrarily). </p><p>Building a bitcoin treasury protects against bad decisions by central banks and gives real estate investors the opportunity to become more independent. When stored in cold storage, those bitcoin are the holder’s alone and are not at risk of default due to the actions of third parties, including banks and exchanges, or rising monetary inflation and arbitrary central bank decisions. </p><p>I want to point out that you have to act sensibly and not take unnecessary risks. Bitcoin speculation can “break your neck.” You likely must be able to wait five to 10 years before using bitcoin reserves in order to benefit from bitcoin's long-term price appreciation. </p><p>It is also of importance to note whether a property is privately owned or owned through a company, as this can have tax implications for owning and selling bitcoin. Discussing this in detail is beyond the scope of this article. You can talk to a tax advisor you trust or actively seek one who is knowledgeable about bitcoin and its tax implications. </p><p>If you decide to get started with Bitcoin, start slowly and increase your commitment over time as you gain confidence. In the beginning, the whole process can be overwhelming. Don't let that discourage you.</p><h3>Three: Sell Real Estate To Buy Bitcoin</h3><p>If you own multiple properties and have already paid off a significant portion of the debt you incurred to purchase or build those properties and understand that bitcoin is a better store of value, which means it will generate higher returns than real estate in the future, it can make sense to sell real estate to buy bitcoin. This must be assessed on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>For example, I work for a relatively-young real estate company. The completed properties are still highly indebted. It would be too risky to trade the security that the company has from the proceeds of a completed property to pay off its debt for bitcoin's volatile price appreciation.<br></p><p>However, if you are in a position where your real estate is not highly indebted, this strategy allows you to use bitcoin as a diversifier to protect part of your wealth from the threat of war, destruction, taxation or confiscation by a totalitarian government and participate in bitcoin’s exponential price appreciation, which will most likely outperform any real estate investment over time.</p><p>Based on my observations of Saylor and how he managed to make <a href="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/treasuries/">MicroStrategy the company with the largest bitcoin reserves in the world</a> in the shortest amount of time, there's a much more viable strategy I've found for enabling real estate investors to buy bitcoin at scale. Namely, taking on debt against real estate as collateral to buy bitcoin.</p><h3>Four: Leverage The Value Of Real Estate Into Bitcoin </h3><p>Software intelligence firm MicroStrategy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsftdrp5w8Y">famously borrowed to buy bitcoin</a>. <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/03/27/microstrategy-pays-off-silvergate-loan-buys-more-bitcoin/">The firm uses its business income </a>to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/03/27/microstrategy-pays-off-silvergate-loan-buys-more-bitcoin/">pay off the debt while holding bitcoin for the long term</a>, participating in bitcoin's exponential appreciation in value over time. <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/06/28/michael-saylors-microstrategy-now-holds-over-46b-worth-of-bitcoin/">The company now holds over 150,000 bitcoin</a>. </p><p>Real estate investors are experts at raising outside capital, usually for the purchase and development of new properties. Using existing real estate to incur debt and buy bitcoin may be an even bigger business opportunity though, as the value of bitcoin is likely to grow significantly faster than real estate over the long term. Thus, a higher return may be achieved. Fully-rented properties are the perfect collateral for borrowing to buy bitcoin, as the rent generates cash flow. Therefore, bitcoin never has to be sold to pay off debts. Instead, the rental income can be used to do so. Since the loan is repaid with the rental income, bitcoin's volatility is secondary. </p><p>Anyone who is uncomfortable going into debt to buy bitcoin can use a small part of their real estate portfolio (2% to 5%) for such a project. So, the risk is relatively low, but you still participate in the upside potential of bitcoin. By now, the Bitcoin network is so strong that the risk of not buying bitcoin is greater than the risk of buying bitcoin, <a href="https://rockstarinnercircle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Why-Every-Fixed-Income-Investor-Needs-To-Consider-Bitcoin-As-Portfolio-Insurance.pdf">as Greg Foss so often points out</a>.</p><p>By taking on debt, you also don't jeopardize your core business if Bitcoin should fail (for whatever reason), since you can pay off the debt over time with rental income. As long as there is enough rental income to meet existing obligations, including the interest on an initial construction loan and the provision for any costs that may arise (maintenance, renovation, legal, taxes, etc.), you are not taking on any unnecessary additional risk.</p><p>The more comfortable you feel, the higher the debt ratio can be. It's entirely up to the individual. <a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/speculative-attack/">As Pierre Richard explained in his 2014 article “Speculative Attack,”</a> borrowing to buy bitcoin is a phenomenal business opportunity. If there is enough cash flow to pay off operating debt (plus maintenance costs in the case of real estate) and bitcoin's value is rising faster than interest rates, which I think is likely to be the case for decades to come, then it is a no-brainer, possibly the greatest business opportunity of our lives.</p><p>While this is the most viable strategy for accumulating bitcoin with real estate you own, it is also the most difficult. Due to the macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties, in my personal experience, banks are currently very reluctant to lend, specifically for buying an asset like bitcoin, which they likely don't understand. But it's worth telling banks you work with about the idea, as bull markets may see them willing to accept real estate as collateral for loans to buy bitcoin. </p><h4>Liquidity </h4><p>Sensibly using real estate as collateral to borrow and buy bitcoin may solve another problem: liquidity. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/every-real-estate-investor-should-own-bitcoin">Real estate is an illiquid and immovable asset</a>. Using immovable liquidity in income-generating real estate to buy bitcoin can be a good option to protect wealth from destruction or confiscation, should one need to relocate. </p><h4>Creditworthiness </h4><p>Finally, real estate development depends heavily on the ability to build creditworthiness. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/why-bitcoin-is-pristine-collateral">Bitcoin is pristine collateral for lending</a> and will potentially help to build creditworthiness over time. Due to the limited supply of bitcoin, an increase in adoption is accompanied by an increase in price. For a real estate developer, this means that the more bitcoin you own, the more collateral there is to build credit and fund real estate construction in the future.</p><h4>Bitcoin-Denominated Cash Flow</h4><p>Bitcoin mining could be considered a bitcoin-denominated revenue stream, similar to real estate rental income (as pointed out by <a href="https://twitter.com/DrBitcoinMD">Dr. Bitcoin</a> in a recent conversation we had). This should, in the long term, attract real estate investors to Bitcoin mining as it reflects the realities of the real estate business. However, it is beyond the scope of this article to go into detail about this.</p><h2>Bitcoin And Real Estate Go Hand In Hand</h2><p>In summary, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/why-bitcoin-is-digital-real-estate">the characteristics of bitcoin reflect many of real estate’s value propositions</a>, on top of offering more fundamentally-secure custody, easier maintenance, a fixed supply cap and, most importantly, the ability to liquidate or take your wealth with you if necessary. Bitcoin is the ideal store of value: secure, digital, difficult to confiscate or tax and virtually impossible to destroy.</p><p>Real estate also has its advantages, namely cash flow and the possibility of calculated leverage. Which is why it is so particularly interesting for bitcoin accumulation.<br></p><p>Bitcoin and real estate go hand in hand. One is an illiquid but physical income-generating asset and the other is a highly liquid, digital asset. You can sell real estate to buy bitcoin if you think it's a good deal. If one chooses to keep a property, the rental income can be used to accumulate bitcoin, which in my opinion is great money for building long-term maintenance reserves. </p><p>We're living in a transitional period, so it's great to take advantage of real estate investment incentive structures while also considering bitcoin's asymmetric risk-reward potential. From my experience, real estate is the perfect collateral to borrow to buy bitcoin as the rental income can be used to pay off the debt. Whichever bitcoin strategy you choose, as a real estate investor you should decide how you want to take advantage of the opportunities that real estate offers in combination with Bitcoin. It may be a long time before the wealthy start parking their net worths into bitcoin instead of real estate. However, in my view, this is a great opportunity to get involved with bitcoin to position yourself in this early phase of the digitization of property. </p><p>Bitcoin's benefits as a store of value are not meant to dismiss the real estate development business. I'm not asking you to stop developing real estate, I'm asking you to add a Bitcoin strategy and, by doing so, to help build a financial system where access to property, the ability to store value and build wealth are accessible to everyone. Monetary inflation has made real estate so expensive that <a href="https://anytimeestimate.com/research/housing-prices-vs-inflation/">it is unaffordable to many</a> and with that, the ability to build wealth is out of reach.  As digital real estate, bitcoin will create a financial system that will be far more accessible than it is today. This will enable greater productivity and efficiency in the global economy. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Leon Wankum.

Even within the U.K., <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2023/06/22/im-in-90000-of-student-debt-and-yet-im-set-to-graduate-without-a-degree-18998327/">tales of students leaving with £90,000</a> (about $115,000) of debt are not uncommon, which raises the question of the value that can be realized by a university degree when offset by this considerable cost. </p><p>To help manage the scale of this expenditure, it is now common for students to have part-, if not full-time, jobs, with recent figures showing this is the case for the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-65964375">majority of students</a> in the U.K. The same article also stated that the time some students spend on university work suffers as a result of the time they dedicate to paid employment. </p><p>As a university educator, this situation causes me great personal discomfort, with students taking on debt to get university educations that they cannot spend sufficient time on or truly benefit from, unable to develop the critical thinking skills that university graduates are prized for. This creates a quandary for budding university students: whether their time and money is better spent on university educations, developing practical skills or simply buying bitcoin, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-will-make-you-rich-not-attending-a-university">as suggested by Bitcoin Magazine’s Nik Hoffman</a>.</p><p>University education has seen further difficulties in recent years. In addition to the costs of pursuing higher education, the COVID-19 pandemic has made the line between in-person and online education increasingly blurred. Attendance and engagement has long been <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/tl.20287">an issue in universities</a>, and I can admit to having issues with those myself, where late nights made getting to a 9:00 a.m. lecture or staying for the second hour’s seminar beyond my constitution. Add the new option of “catching up” with lecture recordings or extensive material online, and the draw to attend in person can fall even further. </p><h2>Potential Solutions For Higher Education</h2><p>How to address this is becoming an increasingly-pressing issue for higher education, with institutions exploring options such as the earning of <a href="https://www.usg.edu/teaching-and-learning-excellence/assets/facultydevelopment/documents/ebook/NeilRigole.pdf">“digital badges”</a> for completing activities or attending sessions and <a href="https://bmcmededuc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12909-017-0984-2">progress tests</a> during modules to link engagement from earlier in those modules to final grades. Each of these options, while having potential to increase engagement, involve considerable costs to set up, and then can add additional duties on staff to administer and record the outcomes for each student. Unfortunately, keeping tasks sufficiently simple to quickly administer and record may lead to them becoming mundane, which in turn may not actually promote the engagement they aim for. </p><p>The problem is even more apparent on modules that require independent learning, such as dissertation modules that can act as a capstone of university learning, where the module material relates to relatively-generic research skills, which are then applied and developed as the student completes a project of their own choice. In comparison to a more traditionally-organized module, in which students gradually cover content for an essay or exam at the end of a semester, students need to do a lot of learning right at the beginning, in order to choose a relevant topic and be able to plan and design a project that, quite simply, cannot be left until a week before submission. While weight-bearing proposals and staged deadlines can be introduced to ensure earlier engagement with material, at times, they do not appear to promote sufficient engagement, with feedback from students continuing to take the form of “I wish I’d started work earlier.”</p><p>An alternate approach to promote engagement on modules has been to provide cash prizes for the best work. Unfortunately, given the disconnect between starting the project and receiving the prize, students who engaged well in the past are likely to be those who engage in these projects as well, whether there is a prize or not. For those students who are generally less engaged, they are also more likely to view such a prize as unachievable when comparing themselves against their peers, and therefore refuse to change how they approach their work. </p><p>The question is then raised about whether there could be a form of financial incentive, but one that is combined with promoting good working practices early in the module. Some form of “treasure hunt,” that requires students to cover the available material online, combined with attending sessions in person to complete the challenge and win a prize. Fortunately, Bitcoin fixes this.</p><h2>Engaging Students Early</h2><p>The solution now seems so simple, I’m annoyed that I was unable to see it before. But then again, isn’t this how many Bitcoiners feel as they look back on the first times they were introduced to Bitcoin? </p><p>The question is, what impact could embedding a bitcoin wallet seed phrase within module material have on early engagement in a module? The logic appears strong; by introducing the challenge at the beginning of the module, and then locating a 12- or 24-word seed phrase within specific material across the early parts of the module, engagement would theoretically be promoted. If students want to have a chance of opening the wallet, they would have to attend specific sessions and review critical material online.</p><p>By staging when particular material (with specific words) was available to students, there would be a reduced risk of students scanning through all of the material on the first day, while also providing slower starters with the ability to catch up, e.g., if only “x” number of words were available initially. In comparison to some forms of session engagement and progress testing, apart from embedding the seed phrase within material and the cost of the bitcoin itself, the costs associated with this approach are low. </p><p>By also keeping the volume of information about the prize provided to students relatively low (covering “value,” “bitcoin wallet” and “seed phrase”), the impact on the material that needs covering in the module is minimal. The potential benefits of this approach is that students will have to explore what these terms refer to, if they haven’t already come across them. The approach also <em>requires</em> the winner, and even those who complete the task but are unable to withdraw funds, to download a wallet, restore it from a seed phrase and then complete a transaction by sending the bitcoin to a wallet for which they control the private keys. The eventual winner will not simply know what Bitcoin is, but will have demonstrated they can use the technology.</p><h2>A Subtle Approach To Introducing ‘The B Word’</h2><p>In comparison to specific attempts to convince others of Bitcoin’s value, whether presenting them with the problem that Bitcoin fixes (<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/an-orange-pill-for-bitcoiners">thank you, Austin Herbert</a>) or identifying those who can spread the word best (<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/share-bitcoin-with-your-barber-or-stylist">thank you, Hector Alvero</a>), “orange pilling” would not be the direct aim of such a university program. Having said that, in a strange way, this approach would leverage the network of the lecturer, and could introduce the topic of Bitcoin to anywhere from 50 to 500 students in a given module. Hopefully, students trust the information they receive from their lecturers, with potential one-to-one follow ups providing opportunities for them to ask questions and develop their understandings. </p><p>To bring this Bitcoin experiment back to the world of academia, it is worth at least acknowledging how it may relate to learning theories. The well-established model proposed by <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF00138871.pdf">John Briggs</a>, known as “constructive alignment,” suggests that it is not about the students or how the material is presented, but instead about the work the student does that determines what they learn. </p><p>The aim of embedding a bitcoin seed phrase into course material is meant to promote student engagement with material earlier, so they are able to formulate projects while still leaving time to complete them. The indirect orange pilling takes place as students become aware of Bitcoin, learn how they interact with the network and maybe, just maybe, begin their journey down the Bitcoin rabbit hole. </p><p>If students want to win the bounty, they will have to engage with the material, keeping an eye out for seed words, with every student starting from the same point, hopefully motivating them to engage sufficiently to have the chance of winning the prize. Even those who do not win the prize will hopefully have engaged more than they would have otherwise (a positive for university education). </p><p>The disappointing scenario would be if no one engages in the treasure hunt, but unlike giving a prize to someone who would have done the work anyway, this situation would at least mean the bitcoin would remain in the original wallet. A final scenario that could be seen as a risk would be if a student falls deep down the rabbit hole and ultimately neglects their research project. However, I may struggle to find a Bitcoiner who would view that as a completely-negative outcome.</p><p>Orange pilling people who are yet to understand Bitcoin is required on a massive scale, if adoption is to reach a critical mass. “Number go up” (NGU) technology is undoubtedly a great marketing tool, which may explain a level of interest that my own students had in “crypto” in 2021, that was simply not present in 2022, but NGU just does not encapsulate the richness of the subject. While embedding a seed phrase to promote student engagement earlier in a module is not an explicit, deliberate, enthusiastic or passionate orange-pilling move, it does promote interaction with and learning about the protocol for financial gain (winning the bounty). As <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/dont-buy-bitcoin-until-you-learn-more">Tim Niemeyer</a> wrote, learning about Bitcoin should be the first step before considering whether or not to buy the asset.</p><p>From the perspective of an educator, a secondary aim is to get the students interested in and talking about the module. From the perspective of a Bitcoiner, the aim is that, if nothing else, the next time someone mentioned Bitcoin, the students would have personal experience to draw from that has not been influenced by wider media or news reports about the latest scam. From both perspectives, providing final-year students, ready to progress into the wider business world, with more knowledge about such an important innovation as Bitcoin is a worthwhile activity.</p><p>Providing newly-recruited graduates (tasked with infusing new ideas and viewpoints into established businesses) such an informed opinion could help a business on a path toward embracing Bitcoin into their operations. A student may be able to say, “I once had a lecturer who put 200,000 sats in a wallet for us to claim” when dollar-sat parity has been reached. Alternatively (and maybe a little more realistically), they may say, “I paid off my student loan with bitcoin, and my first sats came from a Bitcoin-obsessed lecturer.” </p><p>I’d be happy if they said either.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Rupert Matthews.

Countries such as Turkey, Lebanon, Nigeria and Argentina are already seeing bitcoin reach, or start to approximate, new all-time price highs, signaling a shift in wealth preservation and financial sovereignty.

    </figure><div><em>View the 4 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/how-bitcoin-adoption-is-growing-against-weak-currencies">original article</a></em></div></section><p>I have shared these observations before in a <a href="https://twitter.com/BenCaselin/status/1674378556590235649?s=20">Twitter thread</a> and discussions on Elon Musk’s platform have been lively on the subject. Some folks understandably see this as bullish and exciting, but it’s important to realize that such extreme price action essentially stems from deep-seated currency failures and often involves anxious suffering for people on the ground. Others point out that these flailing currencies aren’t really a benchmark for anything substantial, but such thinking only betrays hubris. It’s good to remind ourselves that <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2015/09/28/04/53/sp020416">some 85% of the world’s population lives in the emerging markets</a> — far from peripheral, the reality in these countries <em>is</em> the dominant experience and constitutes the mainstream. </p><h2>Understanding 'Weaker' Currencies</h2><p>To comprehend the Bitcoin phenomenon in these emerging markets, we must first understand the concept of "weaker" currencies. These are national currencies often characterized by high volatility, recurring devaluations and significant inflation rates. Such susceptibility is generally rooted in unstable domestic fiscal policies, including excessive government borrowing and overproduction of the money supply. However, the consequences of such monetary policy aren't contained within national borders; they ripple across the global socio-economic landscape, including in the form of migration and exacerbating inequalities. </p><p>Inflation erodes the value of money, diminishing purchasing power and fostering economic uncertainty. When combined with external factors such as the implications of the U.S. dollar's status as the global reserve currency, the impact is even more profound. Despite increasingly-loud objections from across the world, with ideas of a “BRICS currency” <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/06/25/dollar-reserve-currency-brics-brazil-russia-india-china-south-africa/">floating around</a>, the U.S. dollar is still the world's primary reserve currency and holds significant sway over global economic stability.</p><p>The greenback’s dominance means that many emerging markets are inherently linked to the U.S. economy. When the U.S. changes its interest rates, engages in quantitative easing or when Jerome Powell initiates another rate hike, the ripple effects are felt far and wide. Emerging markets may experience outflows of capital, instability and increased borrowing costs, intensifying economic challenges on the ground.</p><h2>A Digital Lifeline</h2><p>Amid these complexities, bitcoin has gained significant momentum. The reasons? It offers an escape hatch from economic volatility and a new way to <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/store-of-value">store value</a>. The case of Venezuela, where bitcoin adoption has been making headlines for years now, offers a vivid illustration. Hyperinflation has rendered the Venezuelan bolivar <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/venezuelas-bolivar-depreciates-20-per-dollar-prices-rise-2023-01-19/">virtually worthless</a>, pushing its citizens toward <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2020/11/11/venezuelas-bitcoin-story-puts-it-in-a-category-of-one/">bitcoin</a> as well as <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/latin-america-cryptocurrency-geography-report-2022-preview/">USD-pegged stablecoins</a> for everyday transactions and wealth preservation.</p><p>However, the value of bitcoin extends beyond its role as an inflation hedge. Its permissionless and peer-to-peer nature is also a game changer. Bitcoin is decentralized and requires no intermediary for transactions, making it accessible to anyone, anywhere, at any time. This characteristic is particularly appealing in regions where banking services are limited or non-existent, fostering financial inclusion.</p><p>For migrant workers sending remittances back home, bitcoin — using the Lightning Network — can make the process faster, cheaper and more efficient. It bypasses traditional banking systems and remittance service providers, which often charge exorbitant fees and are plagued by slow transaction times. The use of bitcoin for remittances can stimulate economic activity in these emerging markets, contributing to its growth and development.</p><h2>Beyond Speculation: A Tool For Financial Empowerment And Stability</h2><p>The rising acceptance of bitcoin in emerging economies serves as a testament to its potential to transform weak-currency environments and create more resilient, people-centered financial ecosystems. These trends point to an interesting paradox: While developed economies grapple with the question of Bitcoin's role, in part driven by a speculative bias born from the luxury of excess capital, people in emerging markets are already embracing its potential to redefine their economic landscapes, precisely for the reason it was created in the first place.</p><p>Nonetheless, the journey of Bitcoin in these emerging markets is just beginning. Challenges remain, including those around regulatory uncertainties, digital literacy and technological infrastructure. But, if anything, the surge of bitcoin in these economies signifies that when faced with adversity, the innovation pioneered by Bitcoin has the potential to chart new pathways to prosperity.</p><p>In essence, Bitcoin's rising influence in emerging economies underlines its versatility, not just as a speculative asset, but as a tool for financial empowerment and stability. The interplay between inflation, the U.S. dollar's global dominance and Bitcoin's attributes paints a compelling narrative of how the global economy's future may be reshaped by the digital currency revolution.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Ben Caselin.

Almost everyone who is doing the work to understand Bitcoin will eventually run into the cold, hard fact that, at its core, Bitcoin is about freedom. To those who have enjoyed individual liberties for their entire lives, the concept of freedom may be watered down or underappreciated. For those who live without it, freedom and individual liberty become pursuits of great importance. </p><p>Many people who are diving into Bitcoin will find themselves at a crossroads, having to choose between the speculative “get-rich-quick” mania of some crypto subcultures and the self-sovereign, owner-and-builder mentality that Bitcoin offers. </p><p><a href="https://www.amandacavaleri.com/">Amanda Cavaleri</a> embodies the latter. Humble, empathetic and generous with her knowledge, Cavaleri spends her time furthering the cause of authentic Bitcoiners. She’ll tell you that when she first heard about Bitcoin, it did not initially grab her attention. Thankfully, Cavaleri eventually latched onto what Bitcoin offers and has significantly contributed to the Bitcoin space since. </p><p>With a background in artificial intelligence, higher education and policy, Cavaleri has what it takes to move the ball forward when it comes to Bitcoin education. She is the board chair of the <a href="https://bitcointodaycoalition.org/">Bitcoin Today Coalition</a>, board member for the sustainable bitcoin mining company <a href="https://www.cleanspark.com/">CleanSpark</a> and co-author of “<a href="https://satoshistore.io/products/signed-version-of-bitcoin-and-the-american-dream-from-jimmy-song-english-version">Bitcoin And The American Dream</a>.” Cavaleri also hosts the annual <a href="https://www.apres.tech/bitcoin-ski-summit-2023">Bitcoin Ski Summit</a> in Jackson Hole, Wyoming in order to create a thought-provoking space for Bitcoiners to philosophize and have greater impact in their respective areas of expertise. </p><p>One of the many talents that Cavaleri brings to the Bitcoin space is her authenticity and empathy. She openly talks about her past and how everything is layered in life. Her work is truly special and it was an honor to discuss these topics with her.</p><p><strong>How did you first learn about Bitcoin and what <em>specifically</em> drew you to it?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I first heard about Bitcoin from another entrepreneur in a shared office space in 2010. With very little life experience, I didn’t understand or appreciate the need for a peer-to-peer network and first understood it as something akin to loyalty points. It wasn’t part of my journey to understand right away and I didn’t buy in right away. Fortunately, the idea of the Bitcoin network never left me and I was gifted incredible interactions over the years. </p><p>During my entrepreneurial journey, I became obsessed with the notion of preserving and transferring wisdom across generations. Because we no longer live in multigenerational homes and ages are segregated by school, work and post-work, we aren’t naturally transferring lessons and traditions as we did when our species was more agrarian. An African proverb compares the death of an elder to a library burning to the ground. Each time someone dies, so does their unique insight and experience. </p><p>Wisdom is our most wasted natural resource — the lack of preservation and daily interaction with it deepens humanity’s historical doom loop of control, corruption and war. Mass reduction of time between generations has prevented younger generations from gaining a macro, long-term perspective. It is very possible that this disconnect between the ages is a substantial contributor to the increase in suicide rates of younger generations and other mental health issues. </p><p>The idea of wisdom as a keystone to humanity’s evolution, especially as algorithms deepen beliefs, haunted me. Bridging the generations and leveraging technology to preserve and share wisdom is a path worth building. The piece that was missing was a wise network and value transfer system. A solution needs to be able to have an unalterable ledger (preserve the content), be decentralized (one entity can’t control narratives) and have a mechanism to transfer value in a way that promotes freedom and equality (a system beyond fiat). There was no way to authentically leverage technology to preserve and share insights from humanity — until Bitcoin. </p><p>This realization is how I came to believe both the Bitcoin network and bitcoin the commodity are essential to the evolution of humanity so that we may build upon insight, not have to relearn lessons. Bitcoin is that wise technology and bitcoin is that wise representation of value. I started going to meetups and learning more about the technology. My path there was anything but direct, and like many, I had to see the underbelly of crypto to come to these realizations. </p><p>For me it was important to see the good, bad and ugly before I could be sure the solution already exists and it has been in my orb for 13 years. This slow learner is grateful that Bitcoin didn’t give up on her, which is why I decided to work on the parts of Bitcoin that I could be most useful: mining and policy.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What is your opinion on Bitcoin culture? What would you say should be the first step in making Bitcoin culture (in the United States) more inclusive?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Bitcoin culture is in the angsty, middle-schooler phase. Many of us are divergent thinkers and have been gaslit by centralized entities to believe we are wrong. While we have every right to be angry, it is time to heal and not use the tools of shame, fear and guilt that these systems have used against many of us to justify our behavior. Most people I know from Bitcoin are brilliant, kind, courageous humans. These are the humans I want to fight alongside. </p><p>Bitcoin Twitter is not real. It’s an algorithm that feeds off of drama and negativity. Most of us aren’t clickbait-angry, post-algorithmic, manipulating attention seekers. Spend time on Nostr and see what we are really like. We’re philosophical, macro-oriented and generally bullish on humanity. Sometimes we’re even funny and fun. </p><p>While it is extremely important that we have faced and overcome our own pain, it is even more important that we show compassion to those who are pawns in broken systems. It is this breadth of experience and strength in personal growth that will allow us to build a future worthy of future generations. </p><p>I love seeing people go in and work on the one variable we can each control: ourselves. I’ve seen a lot of that in a physical and environmental sense as we become more connected to our food, many have ditched alcohol, we spend time in nature, etc. I look forward to more digging into the less tangible aspects of healing — emotional, spiritual, etc. </p><p>The longer in, the deeper the rabbit hole gets. For me, Satoshi’s anonymity is extremely humbling. We are fortunate to be part of something bigger than ourselves.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How do you typically respond to those who are dismissive of Bitcoin, especially those in your circle of friends/influence?</strong></p><p>Arguing is low-vibe energy (for me). Largely, we get enough negativity in media, so I try to listen more than respond. Sometimes people just need to be heard and if they feel they’ve made up their mind at this point, there’s no point in debating until they’re ready again. We’re all on our journeys and for me the patient, hopeful Bitcoin teachers won me over. </p><p>One example I use often is of a bitcoin circular economy I visited in the mountains of Peru outside of Cusco. Motiv, a nonprofit working in South America, helped women artisans of all ages sell traditional scarves and accessories to earn an income, many for the first time. Because there is no banking option, bitcoin was the easiest form of payment to accept. Not only did these women prefer that I pay them in bitcoin, but they told me how much bitcoin changed their lives. They then showed me by taking me to a local store to buy groceries for the week with bitcoin they just earned from my purchase and to their childrens’ school (where the teachers are paid in bitcoin). This technology has brought resources and hope to an impoverished rural town. </p><p>I want people to feel the optimism I feel with Bitcoin. That’s what I focus on — stories of hope that show how it is used throughout the world. Some call this approach positive attraction, which seems much more effective to me than fear, greed, etc.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In your opinion, why is it important to close the gender gap in Bitcoin interest and adoption?</strong></p><p>There are marketing reports indicating that millennial females will be the number-one adoption demographic over the next couple of years. It would be nice to welcome them warmly. That’s what I will keep doing because that’s what worked for me. Keep focusing on education, humility and patience. Treat others as if they are a family member because in a way we are a growing Bitcoin fam. We’re fortunate to have this layer of truth to guide our interactions. </p><p>The most important thing we can each do is go in. No one is going to do that work for you. It is scary — it is worth it. The inner proof of work by a majority of us will elevate what we build in the future. Now is the time to clean up so we can be strong, compassionate, visionary leaders during the chaos of the bull. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Becca Bratcher.

He spent four years in the infantry before transitioning to the Finance Corps.</em></p><p>It may seem counterintuitive, but in my last four years serving for the U.S. Army, I’ve essentially been a customer service specialist, whether it’s addressing pay issues in the military pay office as a commander, or addressing travel or budget questions as a comptroller in an operational unit. </p><p>Of late, I’ve found myself asking more questions of the customers than they’ve been asking of me. I’ve come to realize that many people don’t really understand the problems they are experiencing. And, because of this conundrum, the questions they ask me when seeking assistance may not yield an answer that actually solves those problems. I’ve come to realize that a large part of my job has become uncovering the actual problems, so that I can fix them at their roots. </p><p>Therein lies a common thread I’ve found with “orange pilling” and teaching people about Bitcoin. Much like the soldier who approaches me, asking a question that doesn’t quite make sense, your friends and family may be asking you strange questions as well — without a real understanding of what problems Bitcoin is trying to solve. </p><p>As stewards of the Bitcoin space and de facto ambassadors to our circles of acquaintance, I see the Bitcoiners’ role as similar to that of a customer service professional. People don’t understand the monetary system, let alone the problems they face within. (Insert the potentially-overused analogy about asking a fish about water here.) </p><p>Instead of answering questions blindly and taking them at face value, I challenge you to dig a little deeper next time. Help your curious friend understand what they are asking. Help them uncover the issues they didn’t know they cared about. Help them ask the right questions. Otherwise, they may never get their problems solved. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Mickey Koss.

For some, January 3 has become <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/industry-events/proof-of-keys-a-critical-test-for-bitcoin">“Proof Of Keys Day”</a> to promote the importance of holding one’s own private keys, as opposed to trusting them with a cryptocurrency exchange or other third party. Other Bitcoin holidays commemorate the first bitcoin transaction (<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-pizza-day-a-day-of-celebration">“Bitcoin Pizza Day”</a>), the sovereignty of community consensus and the resolution to the “Blocksize Wars” (<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/industry-events/celebrating-the-history-and-spirit-of-bitcoin-independence-day">“Bitcoin “Independence Day”</a>) and the day Nakamoto publicly released the white paper conceptualizing Bitcoin (<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/trammell-on-satoshi-bitcoin-white-paper-day">“Bitcoin White Paper Day”</a>). </p><p>Coincidentally, this last one falls on <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2017/10/31/martin-luther-shook-the-world-500-years-ago-but-did-he-nail-anything-to-a-church-door/">the same day Martin Luther nailed his 95 theses to the door of the Wittenberg Church in Germany</a>, ultimately upending many of the Catholic Church’s most cherished traditions, which had barely changed in 1,500 years. </p><p>Bizarre as it may sound, if a group of self-proclaimed wizards get their way, the Bitcoin “religion” will soon recognize another holiday to mark another day of significance in the history of Bitcoin, at least in their eyes. In a Twitter Spaces, I have heard <a href="https://twitter.com/udiWertheimer">Udi Wertheimer</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ercwl">Eric Wall</a>, two proponents of Bitcoin Ordinals who refer to themselves as “Taproot wizards,” discuss promoting January 24 as Bitcoin “JPEG Day” to commemorate the day on which a user on the <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/">Bitcoin Talk</a> forum, who went by the name of “Sabunir,” <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=25">attempted to sell a JPEG in 2010 with technical support from none other than Nakamoto themself</a> (<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-man-behind-bitcoin-pizza-day-is-more-than-a-meme-hes-a-mining-pioneer">nearly five months before the infamous pizza purchase</a>).</p><p>It might not be a stretch to view Wertheimer and Wall — along with <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/02/23/casey-rodarmor-why-i-developed-the-ordinals-bitcoin-nft-project-coindesk/">Casey Rodarmor</a>, who developed Ordinas, and someone who goes by the pseudonym <a href="https://twitter.com/domodata">Domo</a>, who <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-ordinals-surpass-inscription-as-casey-rodarmor-steps-down">developed the BRC-20 token standard</a> — as the Bitcoin community’s equivalent to Martin Luther. These four “heretics” managed to make the Bitcoin network an environment for transacting non-fungible tokens (NFTs), resulting in many hardcore Bitcoiners (often dubbed “maximalists” or “maxis” for short) blowing a gasket on Twitter. </p><h2>The Religion Of Bitcoin</h2><p>I’m certainly not the first person to analogize Bitcoin’s most fervent enthusiasts with religious evangelists. <a href="https://www.michaellewiswrites.com/#top">Michael Lewis</a>, the author of books such as “Liar's Poker,” “Moneyball” and “The Big Short” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWuS_wOUnY&t=1671s">used this comparison on stage at Bitcoin 2023</a>. Describing the process of interviewing Bitcoin enthusiasts for his upcoming book about FTX’s disgraced founder and CEO Sam Bankman Fried, Lewis said:</p><p>“The feeling I have is that you can say something wrong. When I was (writing) “The Blind Side,” my main characters were evangelical Christians, but they were suspicious of me because they sensed I didn’t share their belief structure… It isn’t that I’m in or out when it comes to Bitcoin, it’s just that I haven’t thought much about it, honestly. I’ve interviewed — I don’t know — 200 people, and quite a few of them were like, ‘What are you gonna say about Bitcoin?’… It’s interesting, it’s like a religious thing.”</p><p>This “religious thing” has always irked me, and here’s why: the maximalists who collectively created their own bizarre Bitcoin religion have anointed themselves guardians of it and continuously attempt to apply litmus tests to other Bitcoin enthusiasts for no particularly good reason other than to bolster their “street cred” as more hardcore and extremist than the next guy (I would say “guy or gal,” but maxis are overwhelmingly male). </p><p>On Twitter, you’ll recognize them from their “laser-eyed” avatars in which they’ve digitally replaced their own eyes with fluorescent, red ones to clearly and proudly mark themselves as a part of the religion. Maxis are a disproportionately-loud vocal minority on “Bitcoin Twitter” that seems to enjoy, above all else, trolling and ridiculing anyone they deem as inadequately faithful to their conspiratorial rhetoric on subjects ranging from vaccinations and sunscreen to seed oils, anti-gun legislation and corporate ESG mandates. You see, in the upside-down world of the laser-eyed, being toxic is a virtue. Being toxic is somehow, for them, the way to win over hearts and minds. </p><p>To be fair, maxis aren’t a homogenous group, but they tend to share a common view that Bitcoin is the solution to many of the world’s problems and tend to subscribe to political doctrines of Libertarianism and Austrian economics, and tend to hate what they view as hopelessly- corrupted institutions like the World Health Organization and World Economic Forum. This part, I kind of like. On the shared-beliefs continuum with Bitcoiners, I generally lean their way. I, too, subscribe to most Austrian economic principles, have many Libertarian leanings, and am increasingly skeptical of the mainstream media. And, most importantly, I believe Bitcoin has the potential to be the soundest money ever created. </p><p>However, the part I hate is that maxis overwhelmingly subscribe to conspiratorial rhetoric on just about anything you can imagine, many of which are non-monetary in nature and all of which are complete non sequiturs when it comes to Bitcoin. I’m certain that most maxis would argue that all of these things are somehow related to the “fiat system” they wish to overturn in order to set the stage for a new world in which Bitcoin reigns supreme (“<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central/dp/1119473861">The Bitcoin Standard</a>,” as author and laser-eyed saint Saifedean Ammous, describes it). </p><p>I would argue, though, that these are issues that the average person knows little or cares little about and that focusing on them is maddeningly counterproductive in terms of spreading Bitcoin’s adoption. If the world is ever to convert to said bitcoin standard, widespread adoption on orders of magnitude greater than where they stand today is needed — and stupid litmus tests are a massive turnoff, at worst, and massive distraction, at best, to all but the most extreme among us. </p><h2>An Ossified Base Layer</h2><p>The parallels between Bitcoiners and religion go beyond just the dogmatic in-group mentality of maxis. Bitcoin’s “base layer” code, for example, is akin in many ways to scripture. While <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips">many proposals</a> have been made over the years to change it, only a relative handful of significant ones have ever been approved. Indeed, The Ten Commandments are only slightly less likely to be altered than the software code that runs the Bitcoin network — a feature, not a bug, in the view of many Bitcoiners.</p><p>The process adhered to by Bitcoin’s core developers to change the code is cumbersome by design, requiring anyone proposing a change to write a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) that aims to achieve some kind of community consensus to enact the changes. The ossified nature of Bitcoin’s base layer is a testament to Bitcoin’s decentralization in the eyes of most maxis — something that sets it apart from more centralized blockchains, like Ethereum, which have a much lower threshold for implementing changes. Changes in the functionality of Bitcoin’s “Layer 1” will always be controversial; however, the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/short-bitcoin-taproot-explainer">Taproot</a> and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-segwit">SegWit</a> upgrades, designed to make the Bitcoin protocol more secure and efficient, were adopted by the Bitcoin community with relative ease and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/why-bitcoin-taproot-activation-is-exciting">Taproot was activated in November 2021</a>. </p><p>Herein lies the irony. Had those who determined the Bitcoin network’s governance known at the time that these upgrades would enable Rodarmor to create Ordinals and inscriptions, it seems unlikely in retrospect that the changes would have been accepted with such relative ease. The church fundamentalists got beat at their own game, and many of them (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-community-reacts-to-former-hedge-fund-manager-greg-foss-criticism-of-ordinals/">including Greg Foss</a>, a podcaster and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/authors/greg-foss">Bitcoin Magazine contributor</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/FossGregfoss">more than 130,000 Twitter followers</a>) have been on the warpath ever since. </p><p>The majority of Bitcoin miners love Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens, because they have <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoins-high-fees-create-controversy-and-challenges">led to increased transaction fees</a>, while many maxis are adamantly against them, because they view NFTs as a distraction from what they see as Bitcoin’s core function as a much-improved way of sending, receiving and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/store-of-value">storing value</a>. The network was designed as a monetary settlement and transaction platform, not for the tokenization of digital art or real-world assets (<a href="https://blog.chain.link/tokenized-real-world-assets/">RWAs</a>), the laser-eyed say. JPEG Day, then, might as well be called “Scam Day” as far as they’re concerned. </p><h2>A Battle For The Soul Of Bitcoin</h2><p>While the story of inscriptions and Ordinals is still being written, the reality that JPEG “art collections” and other ordinal use cases may be here to stay has resulted in another internal culture war reminiscent of Bitcoin’s “<a href="https://www.bitrawr.com/bitcoin-block-size-debate-explained">Blocksize Wars</a>” from 2015 to 2017. Only, rather than “small-blockers” versus “large blockers,” the Ordinals have pitted maximalists against NFT creators and enthusiasts. </p><p>The rising tension ultimately came to a head at Bitcoin 2023<em> </em>during a perfectly-timed onstage event dubbed by the conference organizers as “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdYsQ2DWt5M">The Great Ordinals Debate</a>.” Dressed as wizards (and “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhE5LVWgNzA">flossing</a>” as they arrived on stage), Wertheimer and Wall displayed their mastery as hype artists while debating<a href="https://twitter.com/TheBlueMatt"> Matt Corallo</a> (notably, an anti-toxic maximalist) of Block and Spiral and someone who concealed his face with sunglasses, a bandana over his nose and mouth and a camouflage<a href="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/uasf/"> UASF</a> hat (signaling himself as a “small-blocker”) who goes by the name <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_trollz">Shinobi</a>. It was like some kind of quirky, nerd version of World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), as if Don King had somehow infiltrated an episode of “The Big Bang Theory”<em> </em>and convinced Sheldon Cooper and Howard Wolowitz to get in the ring. </p><p>I watched from the audience, marveling at the spectacle of the heretic wizards out-trolling the laser-eyes who had been extolling the virtues of toxicity to the detriment of a thing I’d grown to love as they debated Ordinals and battled hilariously for the soul of Bitcoin. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Nathan Cryder.

This tool aims to empower banks and credit unions of all sizes to facilitate instantaneous money transfers for their customers. The Federal Reserve claims that FedNow transactions can be executed 24/7, 365 days a year.</p><p>To start, 35 banks and credit unions, alongside the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal Service, are among those already equipped to handle payments through the FedNow Service. Furthermore, a lineup of 16 service providers are poised to offer payment processing support for banks and credit unions.</p><p>"The Federal Reserve built the FedNow Service to help make everyday payments over the coming years faster and more convenient," said Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. "Over time, as more banks choose to use this new tool, the benefits to individuals and businesses will include enabling a person to immediately receive a paycheck, or a company to instantly access funds when an invoice is paid."</p><p>When asked if the FedNow service is attempting to replace cash, and if it was a central bank digital currency (CBDC) or not, the Federal Reserve&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/is-fednow-replacing-cash-is-it-a-central-bank-digital-currency.htm">stated</a> "No. The FedNow Service is not related to a digital currency. The FedNow Service is a payment service the Federal Reserve is making available for banks and credit unions to transfer funds for their customers. It is like other Federal Reserve payment services, such as Fedwire and FedACH.
