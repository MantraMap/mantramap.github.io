<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The Acala network is upgrading emissions and burning ACA tokens in the direction of future development.</em></li>



<li><em>The upgrade is targeted for August 15 if the vote passes.</em></li>



<li><em>The upgrade will optimize network growth, sustainability, and safety by enhancing ACA utility and ACA owner engagement.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to the <a href="https://coincu.com/130884-acala-operations-full-resuming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Acala Network</a> has grown beyond the original ACA scope, which had limited utility to support new development based on newly built infrastructure and protocols.</strong></h5>

<p>The <a href="https://wiki.acala.network/acala-exodus-upgrade" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exodus upgrade</a> aims to bring together stakeholders, participants in the Acala ecosystem, network infrastructure and protocol functions, and ACA as a utility and security element of the Acala Network. It will optimize network growth, sustainability, and safety by enhancing ACA utility and ACA holders&#8217; participation.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>The goals of the Acala Exodus Upgrade:</p>



<ul>
<li>Provide a path forward for aUSD with options to exit existing positions or continue to ride with Acala&#8217;s growth.</li>



<li>Build the liquidity layer of web3 finance, including LSDFi-focused Universal Asset Hub that has sustainable and captive liquidity.</li>



<li>Upgrade ACA to boost ACA utility and support sustainable network growth.</li>
</ul>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-709.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="900" height="506" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-709.png" alt="Acala Network ACA Emissions And Burn Upgrade August 15 If Vote Passes" class="wp-image-201892" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-709.png 900w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-709-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-709-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-709-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" title="Acala Emissions And Burn Upgrade August 15 If Vote Passes 2"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Following are the new ACA utilities in addition to the existing ones, such as being used as transaction fees, voting in governance proposals, implementing pallets, and more.</p>



<ul>
<li>Staking ACA</li>



<li>Ecosystem Token Contribution can be used through Staking ACA</li>



<li>Vote to distribute emissions to liquidity pools and dApps</li>



<li>A portion (e.g. 20% through governance) of ACA staking can be used as mitigation in the event of a shortage in Acala-derived protocols</li>
</ul>



<p>Acala will have a total of 100 million ACA emissions per year, limited to 6 years after approval by the board. 50% of emissions will be dedicated to ACA staking and 50% dedicated to profit farming for the liquidity pool, dApps built on Universal Asset Hub (UAH), and other avenues to help build liquidity and application.</p>



<p>Part of the unused exhaust gas will be burned periodically, e.g. 1% of monthly unused emissions, part of network fees accumulated over a period of time will also be burned, for example, accrued network fees will be recorded every six months, and 20% will be burned through administration. This overtime could cause the ACA to deflate.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>By leveraging the available data layer offered by Celestia, the first modular consensus and data network, harnessing cutting-edge technology developed by p0x labs and in partnership with leading RaaS company Caldera, Manta Pacific has built an accessible ZK development environment modularly.</p>



<p>It leverages Manta&#8217;s universal circuits and ZK interface with on-chain integration and easy integration into web2 applications, Celestia&#8217;s data availability layer for security and low gas fees, and Caldera&#8217;s modified OP Stack scalability. Together, Manta Pacific will enable the development of the next generation of ZK applications.</p>



<p>Notable features of Manta Pacific include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Manta Pacific Offers Programmable ZK as EVM native L2</li>



<li>Manta&#8217;s universal circuit allows easy ZK application development using only Solidity</li>



<li>Leveraging Celestia for data availability and OP Stack for scalability, Manta Pacific provides high scalability and low transaction fees for ZK applications.</li>
</ul>

<p>With the launch of Manta Pacific, <a href="https://coincu.com/190372-manta-network-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Manta Network</a> is evolving into a multi-module platform. Manta Pacific will reap the benefits of modular DA and deliver a multi-chain experience for developers and users.</p>



<p>The universal circuits that Manta Pacific offers will be accessible to Solidity and Rust developers without learning new programming languages or understanding cryptography; instead, courses can be called directly into existing applications to enhance and unlock new features through ZK.</p>



<p>Manta Network is a layer 1 blockchain built on Polkadot&#8217;s Substrate framework. Manta Network&#8217;s vision is to create a privacy smart contract platform. To achieve that, the project uses zk-SNARK to provide anonymity, high throughput, and cross-chain interoperability.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Mantle Governance considers proposals for Mantle Economics Committee to manage LSD and ETH Staking proposals.</em></li>



<li><em>MEC would make conservative allocation decisions for the treasury assets and operate independently from asset custody.</em></li>



<li><em>The committee would evaluate strategies, negotiate terms, and prioritize risk management, strengthening governance within the ecosystem.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Mantle Governance, an entity responsible for overseeing treasury management within the <a href="https://coincu.com/164751-mantle-network-layer-2-network/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mantle</a> ecosystem, is <a href="https://forum.mantle.xyz/t/discussion-mantle-economics-committee-and-eth-staking-strategies/7548" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">engaging</a> in significant discussions regarding the management of LSD and ETH Staking proposals.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-702-1024x535.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="535" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-702-1024x535.png" alt="Layer 2 Mantle Plans To Invest 200,000 ETH In LPs To Grow Profit Realized" class="wp-image-201868" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-702-1024x535.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-702-300x157.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-702-768x401.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-702-750x392.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-702-1140x596.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-702.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Layer 2 Mantle Plans To Invest 200,000 ETH In LPs To Grow Profit Realized 7"></a></figure></div>


<p>In an effort to streamline decision-making processes and address time-sensitive matters, a proposal has been put forth to establish a specialized sub-governance body known as the Mantle Economics Committee (MEC). This committee would operate under the guidance of the governance, focusing on minor details and making conservative allocation decisions for Mantle Treasury assets.</p>



<p>The primary objective of the proposed MEC would be to assess and determine the allocation of treasury assets in a risk-averse manner. This committee would serve as a dedicated decision-making body, separate from asset custody responsibilities. By creating this specialized committee, proponents aim to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of decision-making processes, facilitate commercial negotiations, and uphold checks and balances among existing entities.</p>



<p>The proposal encompasses several key aspects that will be voted upon by the community. Furthermore, it seeks to authorize the Mantle LSD and <a href="https://coincu.com/197517-lido-proposes-a-40k-eth-from-mantle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lido ETH</a> staking strategies, allowing a combined allowance of up to 200,000 ETH. The committee would be empowered to engage in commercial negotiations, determine the timing and scale of strategy entries and exits, and prioritize risk management and principal protection.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>The MEC would hold several responsibilities, including periodic review of strategies, making recommendations for modifications to approved strategies and allowances, and making decisions on strategy entries and exits within the approved limits. The committee will evaluate strategies based on factors such as Mantle product synergy, technical risks, commercial risks, and economic risks, with a preference for battle-tested on-chain applications.</p>



<p>Additionally, the committee would negotiate commercial terms for strategies, emphasizing principal protection mechanisms, lower fees, and flexible commitment durations. Risk management and the protection of the treasury assets would remain paramount in all committee actions and decisions.</p>



<p>The approved strategies and allowances, as outlined in the proposal, would focus on ETH Staking and LSD. Specific positions include Lido stETH and/or wstETH, Mantle LSD mntETH, direct staking with Tier-1 node operators for Mantle LSD during the ramp-up phase, and the construction of (w)stETH-ETH and mntETH-ETH LP pairs on Ethereum L1 and Mantle L2 DEXes.</p>



<p>To ensure sound internal governance, the proposed Economics Committee would adopt a highly conservative approach to risk management. Its membership, internal governance rules, and authorized strategies and allowances could be modified at any time by the governance.</p>



<p>The proposal highlights the community&#8217;s ongoing commitment to robust governance and risk management within the ecosystem. By establishing the MEC, stakeholders aim to foster informed decision-making, ensure responsible allocation of treasury assets, and further strengthen the foundations of the network.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Russia has passed a law introducing a digital ruble.</em></li>



<li><em>Once approved by President Vladimir Putin, the law will come into force in less than a month, on August 1, 2023.</em></li>



<li><em>If passed, it would be the largest country to adopt a central bank digital currency (CBDC) officially.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The State Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, <a href="https://tass.com/economy/1645423" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adopted </a>in the second and third readings a law that creates the basis for the introduction of the digital ruble and the implementation of non-cash payments using the digital ruble.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-699.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="400" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-699.png" alt="Russia Became The Largest Country To Adopt CBDC After Effective August 1" class="wp-image-201861" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-699.png 600w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-699-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" title="Russia Became The Largest Country To Adopt CBDC After Effective August 1 9"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The law defines the terms &#8220;digital ruble platform,&#8221; &#8220;digital ruble platform rules&#8221;, &#8220;digital ruble platform participant&#8221;, &#8220;digital ruble platform user&#8221;, and &#8220;digital account wallet.&#8221;</p>



<p>The law sets out requirements for the operation of the digital ruble platform, the procedure for opening, maintaining, and closing a digital account, and access to the digital ruble platform.</p>



<p>Features of digital ruble account agreements, and digital ruble transfers are also clearly regulated. According to the document, attracting digital rubles in contributions (deposits) is impossible. Non-residents have access to the digital ruble platform through the digital ruble platform participants who are authorized banks or foreign banks who are the coin platform participants&#8217; digital rubles.</p>



<p>By law, the<a href="https://coincu.com/191810-russian-bank-launches-cryptocurrency-cross/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Bank of Russia </a>will be the operator of the digital ruble platform. The law will go into effect on August 1, 2023, and is currently awaiting the approval of President Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>If Putin signs the law, it will officially make Russia the largest country to adopt a central bank digital currency (CBDC).</p>



<p>Driven by technological advancements and the growth of contactless payments, Central Bank Digital Currencies &#8211; CBDCs &#8211; a form of the official cryptocurrency of a country &#8211; promise to become the next factor in changing the landscape of the banking and payment industry worldwide. Now 93% of central banks have expressed interest in exploring CBDCs of some kind, according to a 2022 survey by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>



<p>Eighty-six banks responded to that survey, but 130 countries have launched, are exploring, or have canceled CBDC programs as of June, according to the Atlantic Council&#8217;s CBDC tracker.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Aptos network to vote on upgrade for fungible asset standards and improved functionality.</em></li>



<li><em>The upgrade aims to support tokenized real estate and other asset classes on the blockchain.</em></li>



<li><em>Backend improvements and a reduction in staking rewards are included in the proposed upgrade.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Aptos network, a promising Layer 1 blockchain facilitating decentralized infrastructure for internet-based economies, is set to undergo a crucial vote on a significant upgrade. </strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-697.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="560" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-697-1024x560.png" alt="Aptos Considering New Upgrade With Staking Rewards Will Fall 1.5% Annually" class="wp-image-201847" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-697-1024x560.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-697-300x164.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-697-768x420.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-697-750x410.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-697-1140x624.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-697.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Aptos Considering New Upgrade With Staking Rewards Will Fall 1.5% Annually 11"></a></figure></div>


<p>The <a href="https://governance.aptosfoundation.org/proposal/26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proposed upgrade</a>, known as v1.5, encompasses a series of new features and enhancements that will shape the future of the <a href="https://coincu.com/183135-aptos-launches-new-delegated-staking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aptos</a> blockchain and its capabilities.</p>



<p>One key aspect of the upgrade, outlined in <a href="https://github.com/aptos-foundation/AIPs/blob/main/aips/aip-21.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AIP-21</a> (Aptos Improvement Proposal), focuses on the creation of new standards for fungible assets. This development is deemed essential for handling on-chain asset classes such as tokenized real estate and tokenized securities. While Aptos already supported on-chain token issuance, the existing standards were insufficient to accommodate innovative features like ownership restrictions. </p>



<p>AIP-21 aims to establish a standard for Fungible Assets (FA) using Move Objects. This framework allows any on-chain asset represented as an object to be expressed as a fungible asset, enabling the representation of a single object through multiple distinct yet interchangeable units of ownership.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-698-1024x457.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="457" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-698-1024x457.png" alt="Aptos Considering New Upgrade With Staking Rewards Will Fall 1.5% Annually" class="wp-image-201848" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-698-1024x457.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-698-300x134.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-698-768x343.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-698-1536x685.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-698-750x335.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-698-1140x508.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-698.png 2020w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Aptos Considering New Upgrade With Staking Rewards Will Fall 1.5% Annually 12"></a></figure></div>


<p>The upgrade encompasses other advancements as well, targeting backend services to enhance node behavior tracking, enable node restoration from cloud backups, and filter out duplicate transactions from blocks. Furthermore, a developer-focused proposal within the upgrade aims to facilitate the development of cryptographic applications using Move, the coding language specific to the Aptos blockchain.</p>



<p>As part of the upgrade, there will be a reduction in staking rewards, decreasing by 1.5% annually. This adjustment will slightly limit the payouts to token stakers who contribute their assets to ensure the network&#8217;s security.</p>



<p>The vote on the v1.5 upgrade represents a crucial moment for the Aptos network, signifying its commitment to evolving and meeting the demands of the burgeoning decentralized ecosystem. By introducing robust standards for fungible assets and implementing various functional improvements, Aptos aims to foster the seamless integration of tokenized real estate, securities, and other asset classes within its blockchain infrastructure.</p>

<p>Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange has officially launched its customer claims portal. According to the website information, individual customers can access their account information and then submit an application to be included in the crypto exchange&#8217;s Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. The site will be open to customers with accounts at FTX.com, FTX US, Blockfolio, FTX EU, FTX JP and Liquid.</p>

<p>A screenshot of the website shows that the person who wants to claim assets on FTX must provide evidence to prove that they own money on the exchange, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Account holder identification information and identity verification;</li>



<li>Information about transaction history;</li>



<li>Verify account balance by submitting proof to FTX takeover &#8211; with balance as of 09:00 PM on 11/11/2022 (when this exchange announced bankruptcy).</li>
</ul>



<p>According to information from users, the website seems to be limited in the geographical area that can be accessed or is overloaded, so there is an access error condition.</p>



<p>Previously, the exchange had planned to <a href="https://coincu.com/199738-ftx-announces-to-launch-customer-claims-portal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open</a> a website for users to provide information proving their possession of money on the exchange, with the intention of launching on July 3 and 4. However, the exchange suddenly reversed the above decision and did not provide a specific time anymore.</p>



<p>Faced with the news that the portal requires the asset to be opened, the FTT native token once skyrocketed from $1.43 to $1.79 and is now at $1.60, up 15% in the last 24 hours.</p>

<p>The exchange also issued a warning to users about fraudulent links and noted that the deadline for customers to file complaints has been set at 4 p.m. ET on September 29, 2023. No preference is given based on when the request was submitted and the request must be submitted by the deadline.</p>

<p>Last month, a US court said this exchange&#8217;s customers had until September 29 to file lawsuits. The deadline for calculating a customer&#8217;s account balance is November 11, 2022.</p>



<p>In the past time, there have been many signals showing that FTX is about to reopen the trading platform under a new name, just waiting for a unit to take charge of this activity. FTX Japan, which is an almost stable branch during the bankruptcy process of the head office, has also <a href="https://coincu.com/200607-ftx-postponing-sale-ftx-japan-reboot-process/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stopped selling</a> plans to try to reopen.

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Tim Draper stands by his $250,000 BTC price prediction, possibly by 2025.</em></li>



<li><em>Recent SEC actions driving entrepreneurs away from the U.S. are seen as a factor impacting BTC&#8217;s price.</em></li>



<li><em>Draper emphasizes BTC&#8217;s value as a future mainstream currency with transparent blockchain operations.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Renowned investor Tim Draper remains resolute in his belief that Bitcoin (BTC) will eventually reach $250,000, albeit with a revised timeline.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-691.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="614" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-691-1024x614.png" alt="Tim Draper Still Very Optimistic On Bitcoin With $250,000 Price Target" class="wp-image-201832" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-691-1024x614.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-691-300x180.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-691-768x461.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-691-750x450.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-691-1140x684.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-691.png 1340w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Tim Draper Still Very Optimistic On Bitcoin With $250,000 Price Target 15"></a></figure></div>


<p>Although Draper&#8217;s <a href="https://coincu.com/149257-tim-draper-predicts-bitcoin-reach-250000/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous prediction</a> for June 2023 did not materialize, the billionaire venture capitalist asserts that BTC&#8217;s ascent to the target price might take a bit longer, potentially happening by 2025.</p>



<p>Speaking on <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2023-07-11/bitcoin-is-here-to-stay-tim-draper-says-video" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg TV</a>, Draper reaffirmed his optimistic outlook, emphasizing that BTC is here to stay despite recent regulatory actions against crypto companies by the <a href="https://coincu.com/201434-paradigm-sec-exceeds-statutory-jurisdiction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a>. According to Draper, these enforcement measures have forced entrepreneurs out of the United States, resulting in a negative impact on BTC&#8217;s price.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“I wasn’t really expecting for the U.S. bureaucracy to be this aggressive and I thought that maybe they would be recognizing that they got to compete with the rest of the world. They&#8217;ve got to provide a platform from which entrepreneurs can flourish, and by having this regulation by enforcement that the SEC has been professing and driving, it&#8217;s really driving all the great entrepreneurs out, and I think that that has hurt the Bitcoin price,” he admitted.</p>
</blockquote>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-693.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-693.png" alt="Tim Draper Still Very Optimistic On Bitcoin With $250,000 Price Target" class="wp-image-201834" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-693.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-693-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-693-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-693-750x500.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Tim Draper Still Very Optimistic On Bitcoin With $250,000 Price Target 16"></a></figure></div>


<p>While Draper expressed surprise at the aggressive stance of U.S. bureaucracy, he believes in the long-term value of <a href="https://coincu.com/201568-bitcoin-price-plummets-below-31k/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a> and its underlying technology. He envisions a future where BTC becomes a mainstream currency, facilitating business operations, employee payments, supplier transactions, and even tax payments, all conducted on the blockchain. Draper highlights the benefits of a decentralized and transparent system, eliminating the need for traditional accounting and auditing practices.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;It&#8217;s a great system, it&#8217;s great currency, it&#8217;s a great way to operate. I can&#8217;t wait until I can raise a fund all in Bitcoin, invest it all in Bitcoin, have my portfolio companies all pay their employees and suppliers all in Bitcoin and have taxes all paid in Bitcoin, and have the waterfall all fall into people&#8217;s Bitcoin wallets. Because then there&#8217;s no accounting, there&#8217;s no auditing, there&#8217;s no bookkeeping, it&#8217;s all done on the blockchain. It&#8217;s all honest and it&#8217;s all straight,&#8221; Draper said.</p>

<p>Draper&#8217;s early recognition of the significance of Bitcoin dates back to 2013 when he purchased 30,000 BTC following the infamous collapse of the Mt. Gox crypto exchange. Despite the market challenges faced during the recent crypto winter, Draper remained steadfast, urging industry participants to persevere and continue working towards the realization of blockchain&#8217;s potential.</p>



<p>While the specific timeline may have shifted, Draper&#8217;s conviction in BTC&#8217;s future resilience and ability to reach new price heights remains steadfast. With a target of $250,000 by 2025, Draper stands as one of the prominent voices advocating for the continued growth and adoption of the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>The exchange emphasizes its commitment to the security and integrity of customer assets while dispelling any misinformation or fear which has been circulating in the cryptocurrency community.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We take the security and integrity of all customer assets seriously and want to address some recent FUD regarding <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BCH&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$BCH</a>. <a href="https://t.co/gM6e3xb9BX" target="_blank">https://t.co/gM6e3xb9BX</a> maintains 1:1 reserves, which means for every BCH you hold on our platform, we maintain a BCH in reserve.<br><br>The temporary pause we…</p>&mdash; Binance.US Customer Support (@BinanceUShelp) <a href="https://twitter.com/BinanceUShelp/status/1678853356989587457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 11, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>In an official statement released today, Binance.US reassured its users that the platform maintains a 1:1 reserve for BCH holdings. This means that for every BCH held by customers on the exchange, an equivalent amount is kept in reserve by Binance.US.</p>



<p>The recent temporary pause in BCH withdrawals was attributed to a technical issue within the deposit sweeping system. Under normal circumstances, the system automatically transfers funds from customers&#8217; individual deposit wallets to the exchange&#8217;s hot wallets and eventually to the secure cold wallets. However, leading up to the past weekend, these automated sweeps were not occurring for BCH deposit addresses, unlike any other token.</p>



<p>To rectify the situation, Binance.US promptly suspended <a href="https://coincu.com/199044-bitcoin-cash-bch-price-skyrockets-to-325-driven/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BCH</a> withdrawals until the technical fix was implemented and the deposit, hot wallet, and cold wallet processes resumed their normal flow. The exchange expresses gratitude to its technical team for working diligently over the weekend to address the issue, resulting in full restoration of BCH withdrawals on all networks since late Sunday night.</p>

<p>Cinneamhain Ventures CEO Adam Cochran <a href="https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1678523611559149569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">began</a> it all by accusing Binance of being a &#8220;Ponzi&#8221; scheme with an evident hole across multiple assets. When compared to the largest exchange, Cochran claimed that although all assets have not yet vanished, users do not entitle to pay for CEO <a href="https://coincu.com/186874-binance-us-sell-changpeng-zhaos-shares/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Changpeng Zhao</a>&#8216;s mistakes.</p>



<p>According to a screenshot Cochran shared on June 29, the exchange announced BCH/TUSD and CFX/TUSD trading pairings with no fees. He continued to provide updates. Binance&#8217;s motive for the upgrade is Binance&#8217;s motivation for the unbacked publishing of BCH while providing the idea that Sun&#8217;s unbacked shell business currency is supporting that volume.</p>

<p>The recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) notification that the Bitcoin ETF applications were insufficiently robust or thorough thrust US-based crypto exchange into the spotlight.</p>



<p>Cboe, a US options exchange, filed revisions to five proposed spot bitcoin ETFs on Tuesday, stating that it had reached an agreement on conditions with <a href="https://coincu.com/199820-nasdaq-named-coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a> to join into surveillance sharing arrangements.</p>



<p>According to the latest filing, Cboe and Coinbase struck an agreement on June 21, 2023, based on which the two parties would complete and sign an agreement. Previously, <a href="https://coincu.com/199918-blackrock-chooses-coinbase-surveillance-partner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blackrock</a>, the world&#8217;s biggest wealth manager, and the exchange established a surveillance sharing agreement (SSA). Several firms, including <a href="https://coincu.com/199344-coinbase-support-valkyrie-bitwise-btc-spot-etfs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Valkyrie</a>, Bitwise, Invesco, and WisdomTree, have also filed for Bitcoin ETF clearance.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;On June 21, 2023, the Exchange reached an agreement on terms with Coinbase, Inc., an operator of a United States-based spot trading platform for Bitcoin that represents a substantial portion of US-based spot trading platform for Bitcoin that represents a substantial portion of US-based and USD denominated Bitcoin trading, to enter into a surveillance-sharing agreement (“Spot BTC SSA”) and executed an associated term sheet,&#8221; according to the filing.</p>

<p>As a result, the Coinbase stock price increased sharply on Tuesday, despite the fact that the broader financial markets remained essentially flat ahead of the consumer price index (CPI) report. The company&#8217;s shares jumped 14.5% after it was revealed that trading giant Cboe would depend on the crypto exchange to monitor market manipulation for proposed exchange-traded funds to be listed on its platform.</p>
