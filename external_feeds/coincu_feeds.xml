<p>The aim of the program is to backstop banks and other depository firms during the crisis. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis has released data showing that the Fed&#8217;s Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) has reached a record level of $103.08 billion in loans for the week ending June 28. This is the highest level of distressed asset redemptions since the program was introduced three months ago. Despite the Fed&#8217;s attempts to reassure investors that the banking crisis is over, the milestone figure shows that the Fed is still bailing out banks.</p>

<p>Market analyst Joe Consorti has also commented on the latest figures, suggesting that the &#8220;BTFP&#8217;s shadow liquidity is propping up risk-taking behavior across markets.&#8221; As a result of this, investors may be encouraged to take larger risks, as evidenced by the increases in stock markets such as the S&amp;P 500. Consorti believes that the BTFP will have to create a new facility to buy distressed commercial real estate loans and even commercial mortgage-backed securities.</p>

<p>U.S. banking regulators have been asking lenders to work with credit-worthy borrowers that are facing stress as commercial real estate lending remains under pressure. In addition, the BTFP peak has come in the same week that the Federal Reserve announced its banking stress test results, passing the top 23 lenders in the country. It is unclear what further action the Fed will take regarding the ongoing banking crisis, but the record level of loans for the week ending June 28 is a clear indication that the program is still in high demand among embattled banks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>RBNZ intensifies supervision of stablecoins and crypto assets.</em></li>



<li><em>A regulatory approach is not needed now, but vigilance is required, according to the bank.</em></li>



<li><em>The bank monitors global regulations and studies CBDC implementation.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ</strong>) <strong><a href="https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/hub/news/2023/06/rbnz-ramps-up-monitoring-of-stablecoins-and-cryptoassets" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> on Friday that it is intensifying its supervision of stablecoins and crypto assets owing to uncertainty about how the industry will evolve and the potential dangers they may pose to the financial system.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2260.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="641" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2260-1024x641.png" alt="New Zealand&#039;s RBNZ Will Strengthen Unregulated Crypto Surveillance" class="wp-image-199102" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2260-1024x641.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2260-300x188.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2260-768x481.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2260-750x469.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2260.png 1050w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="New Zealand&#039;s RBNZ Will Strengthen Unregulated Crypto Surveillance 3"></a></figure></div>


<p>The decision was made after the central bank received public feedback to better understand the possible ramifications of new forms of private money on both the financial system and monetary sovereignty. Ian Woolford, RBNZ&#8217;s money and cash director, said that the bank agreed with the majority of submitters that a regulated approach was not required at this time but that heightened vigilance was necessary.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“We agree with the balance of submitters that a regulatory approach isn’t needed right now, but increased vigilance is,” said Woolford.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Woolford&#8217;s announcement was accompanied by a summary of 50 stakeholder contributions to a previous RBNZ study on crypto and decentralized finance.</p>

<p>Respondents included BlockchainNZ, the country&#8217;s crypto advocacy group, Ripple, and institutions such as Westpac and the Bank of New Zealand.</p>



<p>Woolford said that the comments demonstrated that crypto had major dangers and prospects, as well as &#8220;uncertainties&#8221; concerning the sector&#8217;s future, necessitating more scrutiny:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“We agree that caution is needed, which also reinforces the need for enhanced data and monitoring to build understanding.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The RBNZ seems to be waiting to watch how other countries regulate cryptocurrency before making its own measures.</p>



<p>The RBNZ&#8217;s statement on Friday follows its announcement in December that it was developing a monitoring framework to monitor and appraise developments in new forms of &#8220;private money,&#8221; including cryptoassets. As part of its Future of Money initiative, the bank is doing a comprehensive research. This involves an ongoing study on the eventual establishment of a central bank digital currency (CBDC).</p>

<p>Although the price even spiked below the $1,820 level, the downsides were limited, unlike Bitcoin, which has been experiencing a slump. A low was formed near $1,817 and the price is now attempting a fresh increase.</p>

<p>There has been a break above the $1,840 resistance zone. Furthermore, a connecting bearish trend line with resistance near $1,838 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD was broken. Ethereum is now testing the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,912 swing high to the $1,817 low. Additionally, it is currently trading near $1,865 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.</p>



<p>The immediate resistance is near the $1,875 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,912 swing high to the $1,817 low. The next major resistance is near the $1,900 level. Moreover, the first breakout level is near the $1,920 level. If there is a close above the $1,920 zone, a fresh rally could start. Subsequently, the next resistance sits near $2,000, above which the price could rise toward the $2,050 level. Any more gains could send Ethereum toward the $2,120 resistance.</p>

<p>However, if Ethereum fails to clear the $1,875 resistance or $1,880, it could start another decline. In the event of a decline, the initial support on the downside is near the $1,860 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The next major support is near the $1,840 level, while the first major support is near $1,820. If there is a move below $1,820, the price could drop toward $1,790. Any more losses may perhaps send the price toward the $1,740 support.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The upcoming halving event for Litecoin has resulted in increased attention and network activity, with the hashrate reaching a new all-time high of 831.16 TH/s.</em></li>



<li><em>Despite recent price increases and outperforming other altcoins, LTC is currently facing resistance near the $100 price zone, with the Fibonacci 78.6% retracement level posing a potential challenge.</em></li>



<li><em>It is important to conduct thorough research and consider various indicators.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Litecoin (LTC) is seen as one of the most promising coins at the moment as its major halving event this year draws near. Given its incredible performance, what could be its next price zone?</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1_aPnBWcqPEJ_q0jqWwB3zvQ-1.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="679" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1_aPnBWcqPEJ_q0jqWwB3zvQ-1-1024x679.jpeg" alt="Litecoin Is Coming Back Strong Before Halving, $100 Is Approaching" class="wp-image-199079" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1_aPnBWcqPEJ_q0jqWwB3zvQ-1-1024x679.jpeg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1_aPnBWcqPEJ_q0jqWwB3zvQ-1-300x199.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1_aPnBWcqPEJ_q0jqWwB3zvQ-1-768x509.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1_aPnBWcqPEJ_q0jqWwB3zvQ-1-1536x1019.jpeg 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1_aPnBWcqPEJ_q0jqWwB3zvQ-1-750x497.jpeg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1_aPnBWcqPEJ_q0jqWwB3zvQ-1-1140x756.jpeg 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1_aPnBWcqPEJ_q0jqWwB3zvQ-1.jpeg 1728w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Litecoin Is Coming Back Strong Before Halving, $100 Is Approaching 9"></a></figure></div>


<p>As the halving event approaches, the Litecoin network receives more attention. This has resulted in an increase in the network&#8217;s hashrate as additional miners join the network. The majority of June saw substantial surges in hashrate due to the increase in mining difficulty.</p>



<p>On June 23, 2023, the Litecoin hashrate hit 831.16 terahashes per second (TH/s), according to <a href="https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/litecoin/hashrate-chart" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinWarz</a> statistics. This is a new all-time high for the network, which previously had data slightly higher than 756.26 TH/ S.</p>

<p>The increase in mining difficulty makes it more difficult to locate a block, thus miners must bring more computers online to boost their chances, resulting in a surge in hashrate. When additional miners are brought online, the Litecoin hashrate has reached its peak.</p>



<p>The good news is that Litecoin on-chain statistics show that a sizable fraction of LTC holders keeps their currency. This verified that a portion of newly bought LTC coins did not move throughout the same time period.</p>



<p>The price of Litecoin, which is now trading at $95 per coin, has increased by about 15% in the previous 24 hours, with several other cryptocurrencies following suit. Although most cryptocurrencies have been trending sideways in recent days, LTC has surpassed other altcoins today. Nonetheless, Bitcoin has stayed reasonably stable in the $30,000-$31,000 price area in recent days.</p>

<p>The spike of LTC left no support, its price is at the nearest resistance, which is confluent with the Fib 78.6% level. So, a revolution can happen until LTC reaches the $100 price zone, however, at the moment, it doesn&#8217;t make sense to buy at this price zone.</p>

<p>Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has recently experienced a significant surge in both trading volume and price, reaching its highest levels since May 12, 2021. BCH&#8217;s contract open interest has surged to an impressive $562 million, reflecting the growing interest and confidence in this digital asset. Over the past week, BCH&#8217;s price has skyrocketed by nearly 100%, capturing the attention of investors and traders alike. This surge in interest can be attributed to various factors, with South Korea emerging as a key player in the BCH market.</p>



<p>The trading volume of BCH contracts has surged by more than 10 times since June 22, with a staggering 24-hour trading volume peaking at 4.427 billion. At the time of writing, BCH is trading at $ 297 after reaching $325, which is up by nearly 30% over the last 24 hours.</p>

<p>According to Wu, South Korea&#8217;s largest exchange, Upbit, has played a pivotal role in driving this momentum. In the past 24 hours alone, Upbit recorded a BCH/KRW trading volume of over $350 million, contributing to 23.58% of BCH&#8217;s total trading volume. Notably, this trading volume is three times higher than that of BTC/KRW on the same platform.</p>

<p>South Korea&#8217;s active participation in the BCH market, combined with the repayment of debts and increased interest from traders, has fueled the recent pump in BCH&#8217;s trading volume and price. This surge not only highlights the growing significance of BCH in the cryptocurrency market but also demonstrates the resilience and potential of digital currencies in general.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Base is close to being deployed on the mainnet, prioritizing security.</em></li>



<li><em>The network has met crucial deployment criteria and leveraged collaboration with OP Labs.</em></li>



<li><em>Initiatives like smart contract audits and monitoring tools enhance security and attract users.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Base, Coinbase&#8217;s new layer 2 application-focused protocol, is only one step away from being <a href="https://twitter.com/BuildOnBase/status/1674543151388966912" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ready</a> for mainnet deployment.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2239.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2239-1024x512.png" alt="Coinbase Layer-2 Network Base Is Ready For Mainnet Launch" class="wp-image-199039" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2239-1024x512.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2239-300x150.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2239-768x384.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2239-360x180.png 360w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2239-750x375.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2239-1140x570.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2239.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Coinbase Layer-2 Network Base Is Ready For Mainnet Launch 14"></a></figure></div>


<p>The Base team revealed their comprehensive security procedures in a block post in anticipation of their imminent mainnet launch. The platform&#8217;s goal is to get the next million developers and billion users onto the blockchain, and security is a critical component of that mission.</p>



<p>On February 23, the exchange officially unveiled Base, which aspires to be a low-cost, secure, and developer-friendly network for creating decentralized apps.</p>



<p>The network is created in conjunction with Optimism on the OP Stack. Because of this basis, it benefits from the considerable security work done by the OP Labs team and the larger Optimism community. Coinbase&#8217;s Protocol Security team performed an internal examination to improve the security of the OP Stack.</p>

<p>The Protocol Security team has worked closely with OP Labs over the last six months to strengthen the security of the layer 2 and Optimism. This involved reviewing all Optimism pre-deployments and contracts on both L1 and L2 to discover technological stack vulnerabilities and dangers.</p>



<p>On June 29, the team announced that the Optimism-powered, Ethereum-secured network had passed its second-to-last criterion for deployment.</p>



<p>A &#8220;Regolith&#8221; hard fork in testnet, a successful infrastructure assessment with OP Labs (the team behind Optimism), and Optimism&#8217;s &#8220;Bedrock&#8221; update was the other three requirements that were met.</p>



<p>Base engaged the larger community in advance of the mainnet launch by hosting a public smart contract audit contest on Code4rena. This competition challenged security researchers to identify and disclose defects in any area of the OP Stack. This challenge drew over 100 security researchers, and no notable vulnerabilities were uncovered.</p>



<p>Optimism&#8217;s node software, Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalency flaws, bridge vulnerabilities, and several smart contract concerns were among the audits studied by security experts.</p>



<p>Base is also developing a smart contract security screening tool to assist developers in reducing the likelihood of inserting a security vulnerability into their contracts. This tool allows developers to rapidly and efficiently scan their contracts and get findings from numerous open-source vulnerability detection tools, including Coinbase&#8217;s proprietary secure trait analyzer.</p>

<p>In addition to safeguarding the core OP Stack codebase, the network is working on an open-source monitoring tool, Pessimism, to give timely reporting of protocol and network irregularities. This tool will be used in conjunction with current OP Labs monitoring tools, Coinbase&#8217;s in-house blockchain monitoring capabilities, and third-party solutions.</p>

<p>CME group has announced the launch of Ether/Bitcoin Ratio (EBR) futures contract. This new contract will allow market participants to efficiently execute a relative value trade between Ether futures and Bitcoin futures contracts in a single trade. The EBR futures contract will enable investors to access cryptocurrency exposure without the need to take a directional view.</p>



<p>The CME Globex ticker for the new futures contract is EBR, where the ratio is defined as Ether futures price divided by the Bitcoin futures price. The ratio will be calculated using the same expiration month for the underlying Ether and Bitcoin futures contract. The ratio will always be positive and will be available across all listed contract months. The notional value of the contract is found by multiplying the ratio by $1,000,000.</p>



<p>Ether/Bitcoin Ratio futures allow traders to efficiently express a view on the relative value of the two cryptocurrencies without a directional bias on the overall cryptocurrency market. This feature makes the EBR futures contract a promising tool for hedging and risk management purposes in the cryptocurrency market.</p>



<p>The EBR Final Settlement price is found by dividing the Ether futures Final Settlement Price by the Bitcoin futures Final Settlement Price. This feature ensures the settlement of the futures contract at a fair value.</p>

<p>After nine weeks (August 31), Forge&#8217;s game premise will expand to include Rift challenges, where select NFT mech owners will have to compete in a new game mode of the genre. &#8220;dungeon collector&#8221;.</p>



<p>In Rifts, players will have to craft, explore, and seek rewards to get to the game&#8217;s final stages. According to Yuuga Forging Game Guide, selected players will have to battle &#8220;epic beasts&#8221; in the game&#8217;s final stages and compete with each other for unspecified &#8220;treasures&#8221; before the game time runs out.</p>



<p>While HV-MTL has a lot of its own ecosystem under the Yuga umbrella, there will also be space for BAYC, MAYC and BAKC holders in the game mechanics. These mechanics won&#8217;t be revealed until the second part of Forge comes out.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Polygon 2.0 will use the new commit and interoperability layer to unify its ZK chain.</em></li>



<li><em>The migration to Polygon 2.0 is expected to be completed in the first quarter of next year, with the current roadmaps starting in 2023.</em></li>

<p>The design of Polygon 2.0 will integrate Zero-Knowledge to support all networks. This move comes shortly after the project announced its proposal to migrate the Polygon PoS network to <a href="https://coincu.com/196671-polygon-zkevm-validium-layer-2-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">zkEVM Validium</a>. Before that, another zk network operating in parallel, Polygon zkEVM, was also broadcast in March 2023.</p>

<p>The proposed Polygon 2.0 network will include an ethereum virtual machine client and a shared ZK proof implementation, which the team calls an &#8220;interoperability layer&#8221; or &#8220;common bridge.&#8221; The in-house developed cryptographic algorithm Plonky3 will support the interoperability layer, and the result will be a single high-performance proof-of-work system that underpins the entire network.</p>



<p>With the new architecture, an orchestration layer will exist to confirm cross-chain transactions, while ZK proofs will provide a shared bridge. The public bridge will connect all Polygon chains and implement ZK-based security proofs on Ethereum to protect all Polygon chains simultaneously.</p>

<p>The plan also offers token resetting, allowing investors to stake the same token across multiple projects simultaneously. And Polygon plans to give developers the ability to &#8220;add new decentralized chains on demand,&#8221; according to a statement &#8211; joining competitors including Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync&#8217;s Matter Labs already make their network easier to replicate, in pursuit of promoting broader ecosystems of specialized but compatible blockchains.</p>



<p>The proposal also calls for an emphasis on resetting, allowing users to reuse their staked cryptocurrencies to ensure the security of other applications on the blockchain. Many protocols, like Eigenlayer, have recently accepted resets.</p>



<p>The expected transition to Polygon 2.0 is scheduled for the first quarter of next year.</p>



<p>&#8220;Polygon 2.0 aims to create an ecosystem where we can continuously add block space and unify them with a shared bridge and an interoperability layer (…). Unified liquidity is everything for Polygon in the coming year.&#8221; Polygon co-founder Brendan Farmer said in an interview with The Block.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[On Thursday, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) announced the 19b-4 filing of the Fidelity Bitcoin Spot ETF on its website.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) has published the Fidelity Bitcoin Spot ETF filing.</em></li>



<li><em>The Wise Origin, Bitcoin Trust fund, is also a Spot ETF like BlackRock&#8217;s iSHARES BITCOIN TRUST.</em></li>



<li><em>The SEC previously rejected the application of the world&#8217;s 3rd largest wealth management fund in early 2022.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>On Thursday, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) <a href="https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/regulation/rule_filings/pending/2023/SR-CboeBZX-2023-044.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the 19b-4 filing of the<a href="https://coincu.com/198213-fidelity-joins-the-battle-for-bitcoin-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Fidelity</a> Bitcoin Spot ETF on its website.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2218.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="494" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2218.png" alt="Fidelity Officially Filed An Application For A Spot Bitcoin ETF With The SEC" class="wp-image-198994" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2218.png 800w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2218-300x185.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2218-768x474.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2218-750x463.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" title="Fidelity Officially Filed An Application For A Spot Bitcoin ETF With The SEC 22"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The ETF is called Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust, FD Funds Management LLC is its promoter, and Fidelity Digital Asset Services will be responsible for the custody of bitcoins held by the fund.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fidelity joins push for spot bitcoin ETF, and Coinbase seeks dismissal of SEC suit: CNBC Crypto World <a href="https://t.co/AhLHuNhKil" target="_blank">https://t.co/AhLHuNhKil</a></p>&mdash; CNBC (@CNBC) <a href="https://twitter.com/CNBC/status/1674495935773024259?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June 29, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Through the use of professional custodians and other service providers, the Trust can protect bitcoin investors from insolvency by unqualified custodians, cyberattacks, and other risks,&#8221;</p>
<cite>The filing states.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Like BlackRock&#8217;s filing, Fidelity&#8217;s filing also includes Cboe&#8217;s custody-sharing agreement with a US-based spot bitcoin trading platform.</p>



<p>The move is seen as a breakthrough for listing a Bitcoin spot ETF in the US, as the SEC has rejected dozens of similar filings. BlackRock&#8217;s submission is substantially different from this SSA provision. If approved, BlackRock will share custody with Coinbase.</p>



<p>Fidelity also previously expressed interest in cryptocurrencies when it applied to launch a Bitcoin Spot ETF in 2021 but was rejected by the SEC early the following year.</p>

<p>Earlier, there were also many signals that the big asset management group is said to be preparing to re-enter the Bitcoin Spot ETF race, following a series of Wall Street giants, including BlackRock, WisdomTree, Invesco, and Valkyrie.</p>



<p>It must be said that the crypto market has been quite excited lately with the appearance of the Bitcoin Spot ETF. Investors can freely participate in the cryptocurrency market without having to worry about regulatory procedures anymore. Especially it is even more reassuring when this product is guaranteed by the size and influence of the US financial empires.</p>
