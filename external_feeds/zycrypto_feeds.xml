<p>CNBC’s mad money host Jim Cramer has slammed XRP, Solana and Dogecoin, describing the three cryptocurrencies as a “giant con” for failing to demonstrate their value beyond being speculation assets.</p>



<p>Cramer made the comments on Dec 8, shortly after CNBC hosted television personality, Kevin O’Leary, over his <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-ceo-cz-blasts-kevin-oleary-for-supposedly-defending-ftx/">alleged connections</a> and promotion of collapsed crypto exchange FTX.</p>



<p><em>“XRP, Solana and Dogecoin, those I believe are all cons,” </em>said Cramer when asked about his general view on cryptocurrencies by Squawk Box’s Rebecca Quick. <em>“Why don’t we just put up like a bunch of stocks that are valued at the same size? so tired of these cons.”</em></p>



<p>Cramer, 67, however, noted that it was important to differentiate between cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, emphasizing that he was a big fan of the latter.</p>



<p><em>“Remember the cons is not blockchain, blockchain is great, but we keep comparing blockchain with the con, and I don’t know how long that can continue,”</em> he added.</p>



<p>Commenting on the FTX debacle, the presenter noted that “blockchain had nothing to do with what happened” adding that the whole thing seemed bottomless and that he did not know how to fathom it.</p>



<h2 id="h-cramer-crypto-comments-draw-ire"><strong>Cramer Crypto Comments Draw Ire</strong></h2>



<p>Following Cramer’s criticism of cryptocurrencies, a trail of comments by disgruntled crypto users has been an outpouring on Twitter.</p>



<p>John Deaton, a pro-XRP lawyer and founder of Crypto-Law US, hit back at the presenter shortly after the interview accusing him of conflating XRP with FTX’s fraudulent dealings. The lawyer went on to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-counsel-gives-strong-argument-about-xrp-as-landmark-lawsuit-nears-end/">defend XRP</a> by reminding Cramer that a range of US government agencies, including FinCEN, DOJ and the CFTC, had described XRP as a virtual currency along with Bitcoin and Ethereum-and, not a con. He also reminded the presenter of a previous session where two CNBC fast money presenters had highlighted XRP and showed viewers how to acquire it live on TV.</p>



<p><em>“I represent some of your viewers who purchased XRP after Brian Kelly and CNBC showed them. He didn’t say it was a con, did he?”</em> said Deaton.</p>



<p>Dogecoin Core developer Michi Lumin also weighed in on the conversation, seeking to correct the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cnbcs-jim-cramer-boldly-calls-dogecoin-a-security-urges-investors-to-treat-doge-with-extreme-caution/">misinformation about dogecoin</a>. According to the developer, for something to be a &#8220;scam&#8221; or a &#8220;con&#8221;, there has to be a mark and a beneficiary. She went on to note that, unlike other cryptos, which had a &#8216;developer premine&#8217; and a way for devs to have an inordinate amount, Dogecoin never did as its code rules did not allow for such activities.</p>



<p><em>“The developers own far less than you may think, far less than other crypto devs do. That&#8217;s because we all had to get it the same way you all did. There&#8217;s no magic button and no special allocation,”</em> she wrote, adding that dogecoin was not &#8220;run&#8221; by a &#8220;company&#8221; or a body. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Cramer, who is no stranger to controversy in crypto-land, has continued to take heat from crypto adherents, with some jokingly taking his comments as a bullish signal.</p>

<p>Cardano creator Charles Hoskinson had a very interesting take during his recent ask-me-anything (AMA) session on YouTube. He said the latest rumour doing the rounds in the cryptosphere is that Ripple’s drawn-out court battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could reach a conclusion as soon as next week.</p>



<h2 id="h-xrp-suit-verdict-nearer-than-we-thought"><strong>XRP Suit Verdict Nearer Than We Thought?</strong></h2>



<p>We could soon find out whether Ripple, the blockchain payments company affiliated with the XRP cryptocurrency, violated federal securities laws. This is after Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson said he had heard rumours that the SEC lawsuit against Ripple could come to an end on December 15th.</p>



<p>The SEC <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">sued </a>Ripple, CEO Brad Garlinghouse, and Chairman Chris Larsen in December 2020 (just a day before former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton resigned from his role) on allegations that it had raised around $1.3 billion by selling XRP in unregistered securities trades. Ripple maintained that XRP sales did not meet the tenets of the infamous Howey Test, a foundational set of standards to determine whether something is a security.</p>



<p>For its part, one of Ripple&#8217;s arguments was that there was no formal contract between the company and XRP purchasers and that there was no common enterprise, one of the conditions under Howey.</p>



<p>Hoskinson notes that the outcome of the high-profile crypto case is likely to have “catastrophic” implications for the already shaken sector.</p>



<p>Both the SEC and Ripple recently exchanged duelling motions before U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres, urging her to rule in their favour without sending the case to trial. Those final briefs requesting summary judgment bring the lawsuit closer to a court ruling that could determine what digital assets are deemed securities in the United States.</p>



<p>The judge could accord either party a win without trial. Ripple has recently scored <a href="https://zycrypto.com/optimism-for-groundbreaking-ripple-win-against-sec-fuels-xrp-price-surge-as-whales-load-up-heavily/">multiple procedural victories</a> against the SEC, but some observers are not convinced the blockchain firm will ultimately win the battle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As <em>ZyCrypto </em>covered recently, Chia Network COO Gene Hoffman <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-will-ripple-lose-to-the-us-sec-this-crypto-pundit-believes-so/">suggested </a>that the judge will rule in favor of the SEC since the securities watchdog has not lost a Section 5 case in decades. Hoffman also pointed out that the company behind the decentralized platform LBRY recently lost a similar fight against the SEC in a major blow to the industry.</p>



<p>That being said, Hoskinson’s remarks should not be taken as gospel truth given that Ripple boss Garlinghouse previously tipped the suit would be concluded in the first half of 2023, though it could take longer.</p>

<p>Day’s after publishing the so-called Proof-Of-Reserves, Binance released a new report on Wednesday showing that its customer&#8217;s Bitcoin reserves are overcollateralized.</p>



<p>The report which was prepared by South Africa-based global financial audit firm Mazars showed that as of November 22, Binance’s users collectively held 575,742.4228 BTC and that the exchange had enough BTC and wrapped BTC to cover 101% of those funds.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“At the time of assessment, Mazars observed Binance controlled in-scope assets in excess of 100% of their total platform liabilities,”</em> read the report, confirming Binance’s <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-publishes-proof-of-reserves-system-for-btc-more-assets-to-follow/">Nov 25 disclosure</a>.</p>



<p>As per the report, Binance’s proof-of-Reserves and Proof-of-Liabilities verification process involved compiling the Merkle Root by hashing all clients’ accounts into a single output. Mazars went on to provide the Merkle PoR key (b47221413078d47b0d9beb40447786904dae1ed2ff35e365416b5de6cd1089ee) to enable Binance users independently verify that their assets were included in the total liability’s calculation through a Merkle Proof.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ftXULdrwv-nX8erpmUl7TCNTmEn4h3Y4UcTHhX8cSCbaJiPS0m27oE7NkE5UseRjJeGNqXS5dLBkXbR6XTwvB9BjWEx4z2SFIHzL_ZBnmrl2W_EDUD1kGarOQqXwRb4FgIi1yDmaEtUAjdDR4HXfZui-mUhjUcS1O8uj8JdcKP9dUv3FubwmXv3i7my59Nm-ClnfcdBUOQ" alt=""/></figure>



<p>It is important to note that Binance is yet to publish proof of reserves on other cryptocurrencies. As of now, that information to only limited to BTC assets. Confirming the report, Binance CEO, however, assured users that they would be conducting audits on other coins in due time. Wednesday’s report comes even as exchanges race to publish their proof-of-reserves to reassure users following the sudden collapse of FTX.</p>



<h2 id="h-binance-s-merkle-tree-por-questioned"><strong>Binance’s Merkle Tree PoR Questioned</strong></h2>



<p>That said, despite publishing its reserve balances and going the extra mile to get external auditors to prove that it wasn’t lying, Binance’s Merkle Tree audit has been received with scepticism, notably by some of its biggest competitors.</p>



<p>Earlier, Jesse Powell, CEO of Kraken crypto exchange, criticized the media for allegedly failing to “evaluate the veracity of claims that are being made about audits and Proof of Reserves.” </p>



<p>“<em>This OBVIOUSLY is not a traditional Proof of Reserves,”</em> he said, referring to the report by Mazars. He further questioned why Binance was using collateral negative balance values instead of the sum of client liabilities. He equally noted that the said Merkle tree PoR did not include wallet signing, raising concerns about how individual users would be able to verify their balances and those of the exchange cryptographically.</p>



<p>According to Powell, a Proof of Reserves audit must have; the sum of client liabilities (auditor must exclude negative balances), user-verifiable cryptographic proof that each account was included in the sum, and signatures proving that the custodian has control of the wallets. </p>



<p>At the time of reporting, Binance was yet to give a response.</p>

<p>Charles Hoskinson isn&#8217;t interested in Cardano pushing into the Indian market until the south Asian country drops its <a href="https://zycrypto.com/tax-rates-to-cap-at-28-as-india-calls-for-crypto-transaction-tax-meeting/">anti-crypto policies</a> for progressive regulations.</p>



<p>The Cardano co-founder confirmed this earlier this week when asked on Twitter by “Sooraj” if he would consider investing in labs and collaborating with universities in India, just like the rest of the world.</p>



<p><em>“India has been strongly anti-crypto, with numerous government attempts to outright ban and criminalize the use of crypto,”</em> replied Hoskinson.</p>



<p>Earlier on, Suraj had noted that Cardano made a huge mistake by ignoring India, arguing that there were enough people with mobile phones and access to the internet who could drive the adoption of Cardano. “<em>Ignoring this market will eventually be seen as one of the biggest misstep of Cardano,</em>” he said.</p>



<p>However, despite India’s market allure, Hoskinson clarified that he did not feel the time was ripe to expand into the region. <em>“I&#8217;d love to enter the market, but it seems to require someone intimately familiar with it,” </em>he added.</p>



<p>India, the world&#8217;s second most populated country, was recently ranked fourth in a 2022 global crypto adoption index report by blockchain data platform Chainalysis. While it dropped from the second position in 2021, India still ranked above the US, UK and Russia, suggesting that the country’s crypto community is still optimistic about the technology’s future.</p>



<p>However, despite the strong adoption rates, India has been blamed for promoting predatory regulations, which discourage global crypto firms from entering its market. Although the Indian government is yet to lay out a proper regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency industry, it recently introduced the 30% crypto tax, which came into effect on July 1 of this year. </p>



<p>Besides the high taxes, India’s Central bank placed cryptocurrencies under a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/reserve-bank-of-india-considering-outright-crypto-ban-says-finance-minister/">shadow ban</a> in 2018 and has since continued to exert “informal pressure” on crypto firms in the belief that crypto could lead to the dollarization of the economy.</p>



<p>In April, Coinbase closed shop in India shortly after launch, with CEO Brian Armstrong citing frustration from “elements in the government there, including at the Reserve Bank of India, who don’t seem to be as positive” on crypto despite a supreme court ruling upholding the industry. During a TechCrunch Crypto conference last month, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao “CZ” said they did not see viable business in India, blaming the government for imposing unrealistically high taxes for crypto traders.</p>



<p><em>“To be honest, I don’t think India is a very crypto-friendly environment,”</em> said Zhao. <em>“A user could trade 50 times a day, and they will lose like 70% of their money.”</em></p>

<p>On Saturday, Bitcoin continued to trade above $17,000 albeit flatly, after recapturing that price mark in late November. At press time, the top cryptocurrency was trading around $17,160 after a 0.50% drop in the past 24 hours. Ethereum painted a similar picture, sliding 1.72% to $1,266 as of publication time, with altcoins such as XRP, Dogecoin and Cardano plunging less than 1.5%.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="599" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2-1024x599.png" alt="" class="wp-image-76319" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2-1024x599.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2-300x176.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2-768x450.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2-1536x899.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2-2048x1199.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTCUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Bitcoin’s lacklustre moves come even as investors take a risk-off ahead of next week’s headline-worthy moments. On Dec 13, the U.S. House Financial Services Committee is expected to hold its first hearing on the FTX collapse before the Senate Banking Committee hearing the following day. This is after Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of FTX, agreed to testify before the panel on Friday following the subpoena threat. The probe, which is expected to last for weeks, is likely to have an effect on crypto prices in the long term due to their regulatory nature. </p>



<p>Investors are also interested in how the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Dec. 14 will spin out. Although markets seem to have already priced in a 50-basis point rate hike following last month&#8217;s “pivot” comments by FED chair Jeremy Powell, investors are worried that a recession in 2023 is inevitable due to the bank’s previous misdoings.</p>



<p>On Friday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said, &#8220;if the Fed raises rates again next week, the recession will be greatly amplified.” Replying to Musk, Sven Henrich, founder of Northman Trader, noted that next week’s rate hike will cement a recession, spelling <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-risks-crashing-to-5000-in-2023-standard-chartereds-chief-strategist-warns/">even more chaos</a> for markets.</p>



<p>Major banks and financial firms have also pivoted towards the likelihood of a long-drawn recession next year. According to a Citi Global Wealth Investments report, the U.S. will likely face a &#8220;mild&#8221; recession next year, leading to the loss of an estimated 2 million jobs.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;We believe that the Fed’s rate hikes and shrinking bond portfolio have been stringent enough to cause an economic contraction within 2023,&#8221;</em> the firm said in its latest wealth outlook report. &#8220;<em>And if the Fed does not pause rate hikes until it sees the contraction, a deeper recession may ensue.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Clifford Bennet, the chief economist at ACY securities, noted that markets could plunge roughly 20% in the first half of 2023 during the recession. He felt that the US Fed should slow the pace at which it raises interest rates with a moderate CPI print. According to him, in the long term, this would weaken the dollar, in turn having a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bank-of-america-warns-of-dire-recession-that-could-see-cryptos-rocketing-to-new-highs/">positive effect</a> on the prices of assets and commodities priced in US dollars, such as bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. </p>

<p>Despite taking a painful hit in the wake of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/a-complete-failure-of-corporate-control-says-new-ftx-ceo-as-he-unearths-even-more-dirt-leading-to-the-collapse/">FTX’s collapse</a> last month, Ethereum has offered traders some respite in the form of a sideways trading market.</p>



<p>The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has essentially been flat in the past week, barely nudging beyond 3% on either side as traders take a risk-off approach ahead of next week’s FTX Capitol Hill hearings. Notably, since tapping a multi-monthly low on November 22, Ether has recovered by about 16%, suggesting the early makings of a potential uptrend.</p>



<h2 id="h-whales-scoop-more-ether-at-discounted-prices"><strong>Whales Scoop More Ether at Discounted Prices</strong></h2>



<p>Despite actual on-chain activity and utility still looking unimpressive, part of what has kept Ethereum buoyed is key whale accumulation.  According to crypto data analytics firm Santiment, in the past month, Ethereum addresses holding 100 to 1m coins have accumulated back 1.36% of the overall supply (about 1.63 million Ether). Accordingly, this cohort added 561,000 Ether worth about $690 million between December 5th and 6th.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/YhY6xAjv-LESmPXGkasmxWFNSyYyvea-vNV3uA60oT9NAIe-mF9qAH6vEHkmmufA6dSz3z1qnq9hywdKANhNVLEzW6yrwHjOdpxve6-68zkO8Upe9j1df3m1AigIaco4Nydvj3bNz-vBkNXnnrqSh_XLPDqGIitoLkTIRwge1s70STDGkXVILM-c_PB9XXkRgPRyEd9Olw" alt=""/></figure>



<p>It is important to note that this group owns two-thirds of Ether’s overall supply and has been vital in helping reduce bear pressure from traders exiting positions at best available bounces during this crypto winter.</p>



<p><em>“Due to this rise in large address interest in ETH again,&nbsp;we can consider this metric as a bullish argument,”</em> wrote Santiment.</p>



<h2><strong>Exchange Outflows on The Rise</strong></h2>



<p>To support the accumulation narrative, Ethereum exchange balances have also been falling. According to the firm, the supply of Ethereum sitting on exchanges “has fallen massively” in just the past month. According to data from “IntoTheBlock”, Ether outflows in the past seven days totalled $4.78 billion compared to inflows at $3,92 billion. It is even more satisfying to see that the 12.1% of ETH on exchanges is now at a 4-year low, further supporting <a href="https://zycrypto.com/gargantuan-feat-staked-ether-withdrawals-are-coming-in-march-2023-core-developers-concur/">the bullish argument</a>.</p>



<p>“<em>The last thing we&#8217;d want to see, especially after a 75%+ drop in 13 months, is for supply to be moving on to exchanges, implying more sell-offs could be waiting,” </em>wrote the firm. <em>“It isn&#8217;t to say that future sell-offs can&#8217;t be around the corner, but the more the supply of ETH on exchanges declines, the better of a case that can be made that we&#8217;re nearing a bottom.”</em></p>



<p>Despite the positive indicators, strong opinions around Ethereum seem to have dwindled, as depicted by funding rates remaining relatively flat for ETH post the FTX-collapse recovery. Ethereum’s market sentiment indicator from “IntoTheBlock” shows that a majority of traders are neutral on the overall market direction. It will be necessary for this indicator to show either a bit of greed or fear bias to conclude how the next exchange liquidations will impact ETH prices.</p>



<p>As of writing, Ether was trading at $1,272 after a 0.16% increase in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data.</p>

<p>The FTX debacle keeps taking unexpected turns. A bombshell report has revealed that Sam Bankman-Fried’s Alameda Research secretly provided <em>The Block </em>and its ex-CEO, Michael McCaffrey, with at least $43 million in funding over the past year and a half.</p>



<p>Bobby Moran, The Block’s chief revenue officer, has announced he will be assuming the position of Chief Executive Officer following the resignation of McCaffrey.</p>



<h2 id="h-sbf-generously-funded-the-block"><strong>SBF Generously Funded The Block</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/12/09/bankman-fried-funded-crypto-news-site-block">report</a> from <em>Axios</em>, cryptocurrency media site The Block profited from three multi-million dollar loans from the disgraced founder of collapsed crypto exchange FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried. The funding was directed to <em>The Block’s</em> CEO Michael McCaffrey, who apparently failed to disclose the loans to the media company’s leadership team.</p>



<p>The report indicates that McCaffrey received the first loan of $12 million from Alameda Research in April 2021 to buy out non-employee shareholders of the firm. The second was for $15 million in January 2022 to finance day-to-day operations. Interestingly, McCaffrey&#8217;s third loan of $16 million earlier this year was used to purchase personal property in the Bahamas.</p>



<p>McCaffrey said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/McCaffrMike/status/1601304758228164608">series of tweets</a> on Friday that <em>The Block </em>was in financial jeopardy in early 2021 and the “only option” that emerged was to restructure when he obtained a loan from SBF for one of his limited liability companies. As for why he didn’t disclose this loan or the subsequent $15 million to any other company members, McCaffrey explained that he didn’t want knowledge of the loan to compromise the objectivity of their coverage of SBF and his companies. He further noted that he “never attempted to influence coverage of FTX, Alameda, or SBF.</p>



<p>McCaffrey announced his resignation as the firm’s CEO shortly after news of the loans came out. His successor, Bobby Moran, posited:&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“No one at The Block had any knowledge of this financial arrangement besides Mike,” said Moran. “From our own experience, we have seen no evidence that Mike ever sought to improperly influence the newsroom or research teams, particularly in their coverage of SBF, FTX, and Alameda Research.”</em></p>



<p>Moran says he was made aware of the situation just before November 24, while the rest of the researchers and journalists at The Block were informed about the loans today during a staff meeting.</p>



<p>“Had I known about this, I would have not only called it out and disputed his actions but called for an immediate change in leadership. Putting aside the FTX meltdown, there is no excuse for his deception and disregard for the 160 people who work at The Block,” posited The Block’s editor-at-large Frank Chaparro.</p>



<h2><strong>Investigations Into FTX Collapse Mount</strong></h2>



<p>After billions of dollars of clients’ money on the FTX exchange went up in smoke in an abrupt collapse, many media houses have reported on a drumbeat of grisly financial discoveries, including huge donations made by Sam Bankman-Fried to U.S. politicians in a bid to curry favours.</p>



<p>The U.S. Department of Justice, the SEC, and the CTFC are all looking into the exchange’s implosion — but no criminal charges have been brought forward, and a court has yet to decide if SBF was indeed a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-ceo-cz-calls-sam-bankman-fried-a-fraudster-reveals-the-real-reason-behind-ftx-crash/">fraudster </a>like Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao and others say. The former wonder boy has <a href="https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1601186246990401537">agreed </a>to testify at a Dec. 13 meeting of the House Financial Services Committee.</p>

<p>In a casual conversation between Cardano community members and Solana community members, it appears that both parties are eyeing the possibility of Solana becoming a Cardano sidechain.</p>



<p>Taking into Twitter, one user from the Cardano community opened the floor for Cardano community members to vote on whether or not they would love to see Solana become a side chain to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/2023-predictions-for-cardano-are-extremely-bullish-heres-why/">Cardano</a>, and the results showed that 80% of voters were on board with the move.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-solana-become-a-secondary-blockchain-to-cardano"><strong>Can Solana become a secondary blockchain to Cardano?</strong></h2>



<p>Charles Hoskinson, who got hold of the tweet, left a casual response via a meme, suggesting that although he may not have any serious plans to partner with Solana on its network being a sidechain to Cardano, he seems to be welcoming of the suggestions from community members.</p>



<p>A sidechain typically connects to another blockchain network. The latter, which is the parent network, is merged with the sidechain through two-way pegging.</p>



<p>Adam Back, the founder of Hashcash, birthed the first concept of a sidechain back in 2014, which was intended to combat Bitcoin’s scalability issue.</p>



<p>In the academic paper documenting the new concept, the authors noted; </p>



<p><em>“We propose a new technology, pegged sidechains, which enables bitcoins and other ledger assets to be transferred between multiple blockchains. This gives users access to new and innovative cryptocurrency systems using the assets they already own.”</em></p>



<p>Although some community members seemed optimistic, Solana might not be possible to integrate with Cardano, as both networks are objectively incapable of integrating due to the difference in network structure.</p>



<p>Both networks, however, seem to have had a notable run this year. Recently Cardano recorded a significant milestone, as smart contracts on the network surpassed 4,000. This comes after the network added smart contract functionality back in September 2021. Additionally, Cardano has seen new staking addresses jump by over 20,000 within 13 months.</p>



<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/despite-solanas-tumble-amid-the-ftx-collapse-the-community-is-keeping-its-hopes-high/">Solana</a> has recorded massive growth in the NFT sector. Back in November, data from Messari showed that the platform saw a 19.3% QoQ growth after securing 8 million daily new NFTs.</p>

<p>Ethereum core developers revealed on a call on December 8 that the network’s next, highly-anticipated hard fork, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ethereums-next-big-upgrade-slated-for-2023-heres-why-its-super-bullish-for-eth/">Shanghai</a>, allowing users to withdraw staked ETH, might go live as early as March next year.</p>



<h2 id="h-shanghai-is-scheduled-to-launch-in-march-2023"><strong>Shanghai Is Scheduled To Launch In March 2023</strong></h2>



<p>The next major Ethereum upgrade, which will enable staking withdrawals, has a tentative launch date.</p>



<p>Following Ethereum’s <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ethereum-merge-successful-will-fork-ethw-get-going-as-well/">flawlessly-implemented Merge</a> event in September, the network’s developers have been mulling over what updates to include in the upcoming Shanghai hard fork.</p>



<p>Multiple factions of developers pushed to have their proposals included, but according to core developer Tim Beiko, the ultimate consensus was to prioritize the enabling of staking withdrawals via the Shanghai update. This means individuals and entities who staked Ethereum (ETH) as part of the validator process on the Beacon Chain will be able to withdraw their stake and any rewards they have earned over time.</p>



<p>Beiko indicated that devs agreed that if any Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) included in Shanghai slows its ability to be launched, those proposals will be pushed back, so they don’t delay staked ETH withdrawals.</p>



<p>One such improvement that devs believe is easy to remove from Shanghai if they will have not finished working on it when the update will be ready for implementation is the EVM Object Format (EOF). EOF is an array of EIPs that basically upgrades the Ethereum Virtual Machine, the underlying environment where Ethereum deploys smart contracts.</p>



<p>Developers will also target May or June 2023 for the implementation of the EIP 4844 update, which will introduce proto-danksharding to the network. This proposal will allow for more data to be processed on Ethereum, making the network’s transactions far cheaper and faster through sharding.</p>



<h2><strong>What Comes Next?</strong></h2>



<p>Notably, developers have agreed that other features such as EIP-3651: Warm Coinbase, EIP-3855: PUSH0 instruction, EIP-3860: Limit and meter init code, and EIP-4895: Beacon chain push withdrawals as operations will be rolled out alongside Shanghai.</p>



<p>Now that what’s in and out for the Shanghai fork is mostly decided, developers will start testing the code. Ethereum devs launched the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ether-whales-load-up-over-1-billion-worth-of-eth-as-price-rebounds-but-theres-a-catch/">Shandong </a>testnet last month to explore and resolve potential bugs in some of the improvements they incorporated into Shanghai. However, that testnet was deprecated, and core developers are looking to launch a new testnet for Shanghai between December 15 and 16 that will likely prove itself to be an important testing ground.</p>



<p>As we advance, devs will focus on Shanghai to ensure it&#8217;s executed as seamlessly as possible. They will likely commence mainnet shadow forks in mid to late January next year.</p>

<p>Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao “CZ” has criticized renowned TV personality and investor Kevin O’Leary for seemingly <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-ceo-cz-calls-sam-bankman-fried-a-fraudster-reveals-the-real-reason-behind-ftx-crash/">defending Sam Bankman-Fried,</a> the former CEO of cash-beleaguered crypto exchange FTX.</p>



<p>In a thread of tweets today, CZ called out O’Leary, accusing him of promoting a scam exchange in exchange for a few bucks.</p>



<p><em>“It seems $15m not only changed Kevin Oleary’s mind about crypto, it also made him align with a fraudster. Is he seriously defending SBF?”</em> asked CZ.</p>



<p>CZ’s remarks come after O’Leary revealed in an interview with CNBC on Thursday that he had lost all of the $15 million paid to him by FTX to act as its spokesman and promoter when it collapsed. During the interview, the businessman was also grilled over his failure to conduct sufficient due diligence to assess the risks associated with investing and promoting FTX.</p>



<p>In response, O’Leary said that he had fallen prey to “group think”, adding that none of his investment partners had lost money. He also defended Bankman fried against recent accusations saying, “If you want to say he&#8217;s guilty before he&#8217;s tried, I <em>don&#8217;t understand it. There&#8217;s only the murder of my money in this case.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>CZ, who has previously been accused of bringing down FTX, wondered how O’Leary, also known as “Mr Wonderful” for his “helpful assessments to reflection misguided entrepreneurs”, could fall for the trap when it was clear that the crypto exchange had all along been operating beyond its means. At the height of its success last year, FTX went on a spending spree, investing over $5.5 billion in a myriad of companies, advertisements, luxury real estate, as well as making <a href="https://zycrypto.com/elon-musk-questions-sbfs-donations-to-democrats-says-they-could-be-more-than-1b/">massive political donations</a>.</p>



<p><em>“You don&#8217;t have to be a genius to know something doesn&#8217;t smell right at FTX,”</em> said CZ. <em>“They were 1/10th our size, yet outspent us 100/1 on marketing &amp; &#8220;partnerships&#8221;, fancy parties in the Bahamas, trips across the globe, and mansions for all of their senior staff (and his parents).</em></p>



<p>According to CZ, on top of those expenses being funded by customer funds, FTX put various celebrities like O’Leary to smear Binance and manipulate public opinion after the exchange became uncomfortable with Alameda and FTX and started exiting its investment positions in FTX last year.</p>



<p>CZ also accused O’Leary of using ethnicity-focused attacks by describing Binance as a Chinese company in a bid to make it unpopular, adding that “<em>If Kevin O’Leary is looking for someone to blame for the implosion of FTX, he should start by wagging his finger at his investment partner, Sam, and then perhaps at the man in the mirror.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>That said, O’Leary, however, continues to maintain he is innocent, saying that he was misled just like the rest of the investors. At press time, the businessman was yet to respond to our request for comments on CZ’s claims.</p>

<p>The USDC stablecoin saga continues as leading cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase attempts to ease the conversion process of USDT holders looking to convert their USDT to USDC. The onlooker brand strategic move comes not long after Binance halted all of the USDC trading pairs on its platform.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-war-between-stablecoins-and-exchanges-drags-on"><strong>The war between Stablecoins and exchanges drags on</strong></h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/switch-to-the-trusted-and-reputable-digital-dollar-usdc">blog post</a> published on Coinbase’s website, dated 8th December, Coinbase highlights its support for USDC with a compelling blog title that reads “Switch to the trusted and reputable digital dollar: USDC.”</p>



<p>The blog post essentially goes over USDC’s admirable quality, highlighting a <em>“high-quality reserve”</em> as one of its upsides. Keep in mind that USDT has, in the past, been critiqued for lack of transparency on its reserve. USDT has also been accused of lying about its equal backing to the U.S. dollar.</p>



<p>The allegations put stablecoins like USDC in a better position for adoption amongst stablecoin users and holders. Pitching USDC to users as the most reputable stablecoin in the market, Coinbase scraps out conversion fees for retail users.</p>



<p>Excerpts of the blog post reads; </p>



<p><em>“However, the events of the past few weeks have put some stablecoins to the test and we’ve seen a flight to safety. We believe that USD Coin (USDC) is a trusted and reputable stablecoin, so we’re making it more frictionless to switch: starting today we’re waiving fees for global retail customers to convert USDT to USDC.“</em></p>



<p>The move could cause trading volume for USDC to surge on Coinbase, especially considering that USDT traded below $1 for a large part of November.</p>



<p>Explaining how the conversion structure is patterned, Coinbase added that there will be “<em>No commission fee or spread for USDT to USDC conversions on Coinbase Simple Trade in eligible regions, until further notice. Conversion rate is determined at trade execution, and is subject to market volatility. Not investment advice. Standard fees apply on Coinbase Advanced Trade, Prime, and Exchange.</em>&#8220;</p>



<p>Recall that Binance, another leading exchange, had <a href="https://zycrypto.com/why-binance-is-booting-usdc-two-other-stablecoins-out-of-exchange-in-favor-of-busd/">delisted three stablecoins</a> back in September. USDP, TUSD, and USDC training pairs were removed from the platform. On the 29th of September, Binance concluded the conversion of the aforementioned stablecoins to BUSD. </p>

<p>Ripple’s top lawyer Stuart Alderoty has again taken to Twitter to meticulously counter the allegations made by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the ongoing <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-attorney-reveals-ripples-biggest-danger-in-sec-case-as-it-edges-towards-gigantic-win/">high-profile suit</a>.</p>



<p>Alderoty reiterated the blockchain payments firm’s defence while taking aim at the agency and skeptics.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-xrp-suit-ending-soon"><strong>Is XRP Suit Ending Soon?</strong></h2>



<p>Ripple’s general counsel Stuart Alderoty argues that there is no investment contract because there’s no formal contract between the company and purchasers. Alderoty further noted that the SEC has failed to satisfy any of the limbs of the infamous Howey Test. He also points out that the commission’s reliance on precedent initial coin offering (ICO) cases has no bearing on the XRP lawsuit.</p>



<p>Ripple was sued in December 2020 for allegedly raising more than $1.3 billion through an unregistered securities offering. The case is one of the biggest crypto suits before the SEC, and it has attracted a great deal of media coverage because of the popularity of the XRP cryptocurrency, which is used in Ripple’s payment network.</p>



<p>The case is also approaching conclusion after a gruelling two-year-long battle. Earlier this month, Ripple and the SEC filed redacted replies to each other’s opposition to motions <a href="https://zycrypto.com/secs-battle-with-ripple-labs-nears-its-end-following-parties-application-for-summary-judgement/">for summary judgment</a>.</p>



<p>Notably, Ripple’s Alderoty states that the regulator is striving to alter the firm’s arguments as they have no answers to the aforementioned ones that it makes. In this vein, he notes that the SEC should at least try to understand Ripple’s legal positions before trying to debunk them.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The reason the SEC and detractors try to recast our arguments is they have no answer for the arguments we actually make.</p>&mdash; Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) <a href="https://twitter.com/s_alderoty/status/1600535890253991936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 7, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>In another recent tweet, Alderoty agreed that the long-drawn case might be nearing the end. </p>



<h2><strong>Significance of Ripple Case In Crypto Regulation</strong></h2>



<p>It’s common practice for companies under the SEC microscope to settle allegations quietly without going to trial, which is why Ripple’s case is so rare —&nbsp; offering a courtroom test of the law. Ripple pledges to fight the suit right to the Supreme Court. According to Alderoty, the company is proud of the defense it has mounted so far on behalf of the entire cryptocurrency industry.</p>



<p>Win or lose, Ripple is likely to set an example for peers. Whether its native cryptocurrency XRP falls within the parameters of what constitutes a security will ultimately be for the court to decide.</p>



<p>That being said, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-will-ripple-lose-to-the-us-sec-this-crypto-pundit-believes-so/">Ripple losing</a> would essentially give the SEC the ammunition it needs to go after other companies in the cryptoverse. In other words, the result of that legal wrangle could permanently alter the fate of crypto trading.</p>

<p>Cardano supporters assert that 2023 will be a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardanos-self-regulated-stablecoin-set-for-launch-in-early-2023-is-ada-ready-for-a-go-at-1/">highly bullish year</a> for the Cardano network&#8217;s ecosystem and native token ADA.</p>



<p>In a recent Twitter thread, pseudonymous Cardano community pundit and ambassador &#8216;ADA Whale&#8217; revealed why he believes the coming year will be massive for the network.</p>



<p>&#8216;ADA Whale&#8217; stated that with governance coming in 2023, Cardano is set to turn the tables on other blockchain networks as opposed to what has been playing out in 2020-2022, where Cardano has been &#8220;mostly playing catch up&#8221; and letting them set the narrative.</p>



<p>With governance, Cardano will be self-governed and start taking things in a more ambitious direction than flipping shitcoins. According to the pundit, this will shock the blockchain space and get participants in other networks demanding on-chain self-governance.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;The real shock to the system will come when they realize that to many there’s more appeal in joining a global digital people’s movement that wants to improve the world, rules itself and has a fully loaded treasury at its disposal, than there is to becoming a wannabe banker,&#8221; he wrote.</em></p>



<h2 id="h-how-will-governance-put-cardano-ahead-of-other-networks"><strong>How will governance put Cardano ahead of other networks?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>&#8216;ADA Whale&#8217; isn&#8217;t the only Cardano community member bullish on the new era the network is set to enter. Back in October, CEO of IOG <a href="https://zycrypto.com/charles-hoskinson-claims-ethereum-lags-behind-cardano-despite-transition-to-proof-of-stake/">Charles Hoskinson</a> stated that the era dubbed the Age of Voltaire—after the 17th-century French philosopher and prolific writer—will teach other industry players &#8220;how to do decentralized governance.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Voltaire era will essentially see Cardano become fully autonomous by introducing voting and treasury systems to mark the complete decentralization of the network.</p>



<p>According to an IOG blog post, Cardano is already testing running treasury mechanisms in Project Catalyst—Cardano&#8217;s ecosystem support program—which combines research, social experiments, and community consent to establish open, a democratic culture within the Cardano community.</p>



<p>The initiative will ultimately remove Cardano core companies like IOG, the Cardano Foundation, and Emurgo from the driving seat of the network and place all future advancement decisions in the hands of the entire community.</p>



<p>The network has also started to see benefits from upgrades carried out this year, including the Vasil hardfork, which has cut transaction fees and block space consumption.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the price of ADA has continued to trade far below its previous all-time high (ATH) of about $3 reached in Sept. 2021. At press time, ADA was trading at around $0.31, up 1.95% in the last 24 hours and 89.9% from ATH. </p>

<ul>
<li>Binance.US says it has immediately eliminated trading fees for Ethereum (ETH).</li>



<li>The exchange had previously cancelled the policy of charging fees on Bitcoin (BTC) as it pushed to become the leading platform in the industry.</li>



<li>Binance.US is eyeing expansion outside of the U.S. mainland after gaining new licenses.</li>
</ul>



<p>Binance.US has <a href="https://twitter.com/BinanceUS/status/1600496453151068160?s=20&amp;t=Bn2F3Q3660jg39THM6otKQ">unveiled</a> an early Christmas gift for users by removing trading fees for ETH while offering additional discounts for customers that pay trading fees with BNB.</p>



<p>The U.S. iteration of Binance has officially cancelled the requirement of trading fees for users that buy and sell ETH on the platform. The new policy will apply immediately to the spot market pairs of ETH/USD, ETH/USDT, ETH/USDC, and ETH/BUSD.</p>



<p>Gas fees will also not be charged for all ETH transactions made through the “Buy and Sell” feature on the platform. In addition, Binance.US also announced perks for customers using BNB to pay their trading fees as it looks to cement its place as the foremost exchange in the industry.</p>



<p><em>“By eliminating fees first on BTC and now ETH, we are raising awareness for the high fees consumers are paying on other platforms, and helping to restore trust in the greater ecosystem,”</em> said Brian Shroder, Binance.US CEO. “Now more than ever, it’s critical that platforms operate with users’ interest first.”</p>



<p>In June, Binance.US removed all charges relating to Bitcoin (BTC) transactions in a move that mirrors the decision of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-trading-for-over-17-million-robinhood-users-is-a-mind-blowing-shib-moonshot-incoming/">Robinhood</a> to introduce no-commission trading of digital assets back in 2018.</p>



<p>Digital asset exchanges typically rake in profits by charging a percentage on each trade, but even with the elimination of trading fees, exchanges can still earn on spreads. The decision of Binance.US to remove trading fees has been hailed as one that has the potential to improve the adoption rates of the asset class.</p>



<h2 id="h-binance-us-spreads-its-tentacles"><strong>Binance.US spreads its tentacles</strong></h2>



<p>Binance.US disclosed that the top agenda is to gain a license in all 50 states before the end of the year. In line with the goals, the exchange went on to snag licenses in Louisiana and Colorado after confirming that it was on track to achieve the target.</p>



<p>With only three weeks to go until the end of the year, the exchange has yet to obtain an operational license in Hawaii, New York, Texas, and Vermont. However, it has successfully launched operations in the U.S. territories of American Samoa and Guam.</p>
