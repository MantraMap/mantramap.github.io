			  <description><![CDATA[<p>With the BTC halving approaching and the markets going through another bearish move, what does this mean for hodlers, and when is the next halving scheduled? Tradecurve offers a convenient trading solution that covers multiple markets using just one wallet, and perhaps the best part is that no KYC is required.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Bitcoin's Halving: What You Need to Know</p>
<p>BTC-USD is the most widely traded cryptocurrency pair in the world. Since its introduction in 2009, BTC has experienced several cycles that have shaped its price and value. One of the most significant events is the halving, which occurs approximately every 4 years or every 210,000 blocks created. The next halving is expected to take place around April 2024. During the halving, the mining rate decreases from 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125 BTC per block.</p>
<p>The halving is a major event because it reduces the rate at which new Bitcoins are introduced into circulation. With a fixed supply of 21 million coins, reducing the supply of new coins through the halving can increase the scarcity and value of Bitcoin over time.</p>
<p>Bitcoin mining involves powerful computers competing to solve complex mathematical problems and add new blocks to the blockchain. The halving cuts these rewards in half, which means miners have to work twice as hard to earn the same amount of BTC.</p>
<p>If history is any indication, the halving is a bullish event for BTC, and Bitcoin holders can expect significant volatility after the next halving in April 2024.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tradecurve.io: A Ground-Breaking, Borderless Trading Platform</p>
<p>Thanks to DeFi and blockchain technology, everyone has the option to have their wallet keys and maintain control over their investments. Tradecurve takes advantage of this by offering a trading platform created by traders for traders. It combines the best features of centralized and decentralized exchanges.</p>
<p>Tradecurve stands out with its cutting-edge trading platform, high leverage, and minimal trading fees. The registration process is simple, and there's no need for KYC verification. Customers can seamlessly join an international ecosystem.</p>
<p>Using Tradecurve's brokerage services, people can use cryptocurrency deposits as collateral for trading derivatives and access multiple markets from a single account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Staking pools enable TCRV owners to generate additional passive income. Leverage trading starts at 500:1, and a comprehensive metaverse academy offers numerous options for self-development. The expanding user base enjoys round-the-clock customer service and a regularly updated FAQ section.</p>
<p>Token allocation demonstrates a respectable distribution, with 40% of the total supply reserved for presale, 15% for the Tradecurve team, 14% for reserves, 9% for burning, and the remainder for legal advice and listings.</p>
<p>Investors are intrigued by Tradecurve's potential, and during the second stage of its presale, TCRV is listed at $0.012. Analysts predict gains of up to 800% for TCRV in the coming month as it gets listed on Uniswap and other major exchanges, and gains of 100x after it launches on Tier 1 exchanges.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s4">Dogecoin (DOGE) remains the torchbearer of all meme coins with certain fluctuations and downfalls. A strong community of supporters and influence from noteworthy personnel still keeps the crypto in the top 10. Dogecoin has been showing impressive performance, despite multiple setbacks.</p>
<p class="s4">And it continues to inch toward the $0.1 milestone within months, predicted to reach even the $1.0 mark in 2023. DOGE's achievement of such a price means excellent profits for traders and investors.</p>
<p class="s4">However, the market value now remains over $0.07, requiring a significant boost in the meme coin. Recent growth in capital and reduction of crypto market outflows will likely take a bullish turn soon. Therefore, an enormous increment in value is possible in the coming months.</p>
<p class="s4">The crypto keeps struggling around the $0.07 mark for about a month, dipping significantly initially. Yet, within weeks, it recovered a significant share of the lost market cap. And the daily transaction numbers reached an all-time high due to the near-bullish forecast of the market.</p>
<p class="s4">Meantime, the first-ever blockchain-supported freelancing platform, Uwerx, doesn't fall behind. Its native crypto, WERX, currently values a mere $0.0315 at the presales. But analysts recognized the potential, predicting an exponential price rise to reach as much as $0.3 by Q3 of 2023.</p>
<p class="s4">The ongoing presales have already entered the fourth stage, completing the first in 17 days and the second in 8 days. Freelancers, investors, and analysts look forward to Uwerx's mainstream success as the platform integrates some unique features for target users.</p>
<p class="s8">Why Does Uwerx Matter So Much?</p>
<p class="s4">Uwerx allows freelancers to earn a minimal 1% transaction fee, considerably lower than traditional platforms. Freelancers will receive payments directly to their WERX hubs, letting them interact with the crypto space. And it'll unveil a new door to crypto-related businesses.</p>
<p class="s4">An audit by InterFi Network and SolidProof already set the foundation of top-tier security. The platform already introduced a custom vault to lock up the tokens in the 25-year liquidity pool. So, all clients' and freelancers' assets and intellectual properties will have a steady backup for security.</p>
<p class="s4">There are advanced features like gamification and incentivization to avoid dull, monotonous, and tiresome work. It should keep the freelancers motivated and enthusiastic to take on new challenges. Analysts and investors also recognized these benefits, counting on the innovative blockchain system.</p>
<p class="s4">A lot is happening within Uwerx as many development tasks are underway to become accessible to the public. It'll start with the release of Uwerx's Alpha version on May 19, 2023, featuring the landing and signup pages. The team plans to continue releasing the next versions based on user feedback.</p>
<p class="s4">The much-hyped presales will end on July 31, 2023, and the Team Lock of tokens will happen before that. A recent Twitter poll revealed 82.8% of voters opted for immediately locking the tokens. And the Uwerx team is getting ready to announce the possible date following the scheduled Test Airdrop.</p>
<p class="s4">The listing of WERX is also gaining momentum as CoinSniper already recognized the token. Uniswap will likely introduce the crypto in its portfolio by August 01, 2023. Launching in centralized exchanges should let the platform initiate the renouncement of contract ownership, lessening tax worries.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="s4">Dogecoin (DOGE) remains the torchbearer of all meme coins with certain fluctuations and downfalls. A strong community of supporters and influence from noteworthy personnel still keeps the crypto in the top 10. Dogecoin has been showing impressive performance, despite multiple setbacks.</p>
<p class="s4">And it continues to inch toward the $0.1 milestone within months, predicted to reach even the $1.0 mark in 2023. DOGE's achievement of such a price means excellent profits for traders and investors.</p>
<p class="s4">However, the market value now remains over $0.07, requiring a significant boost in the meme coin. Recent growth in capital and reduction of crypto market outflows will likely take a bullish turn soon. Therefore, an enormous increment in value is possible in the coming months.</p>
<p class="s4">The crypto keeps struggling around the $0.07 mark for about a month, dipping significantly initially. Yet, within weeks, it recovered a significant share of the lost market cap. And the daily transaction numbers reached an all-time high due to the near-bullish forecast of the market.</p>
<p class="s4">Meantime, the first-ever blockchain-supported freelancing platform, Uwerx, doesn't fall behind. Its native crypto, WERX, currently values a mere $0.0315 at the presales. But analysts recognized the potential, predicting an exponential price rise to reach as much as $0.3 by Q3 of 2023.</p>
<p class="s4">The ongoing presales have already entered the fourth stage, completing the first in 17 days and the second in 8 days. Freelancers, investors, and analysts look forward to Uwerx's mainstream success as the platform integrates some unique features for target users.</p>
<p class="s8">Why Does Uwerx Matter So Much?</p>
<p class="s4">Uwerx allows freelancers to earn a minimal 1% transaction fee, considerably lower than traditional platforms. Freelancers will receive payments directly to their WERX hubs, letting them interact with the crypto space. And it'll unveil a new door to crypto-related businesses.</p>
<p class="s4">An audit by InterFi Network and SolidProof already set the foundation of top-tier security. The platform already introduced a custom vault to lock up the tokens in the 25-year liquidity pool. So, all clients' and freelancers' assets and intellectual properties will have a steady backup for security.</p>
<p class="s4">There are advanced features like gamification and incentivization to avoid dull, monotonous, and tiresome work. It should keep the freelancers motivated and enthusiastic to take on new challenges. Analysts and investors also recognized these benefits, counting on the innovative blockchain system.</p>
<p class="s4">A lot is happening within Uwerx as many development tasks are underway to become accessible to the public. It'll start with the release of Uwerx's Alpha version on May 19, 2023, featuring the landing and signup pages. The team plans to continue releasing the next versions based on user feedback.</p>
<p class="s4">The much-hyped presales will end on July 31, 2023, and the Team Lock of tokens will happen before that. A recent Twitter poll revealed 82.8% of voters opted for immediately locking the tokens. And the Uwerx team is getting ready to announce the possible date following the scheduled Test Airdrop.</p>
<p class="s4">The listing of WERX is also gaining momentum as CoinSniper already recognized the token. Uniswap will likely introduce the crypto in its portfolio by August 01, 2023. Launching in centralized exchanges should let the platform initiate the renouncement of contract ownership, lessening tax worries.</p>
<p class="s4">The WERX presales exceeded expectations in every aspect, gaining much appreciation from the crypto space. And the demand keeps increasing as the forecast indicates exploding surges in price. The Uwerx team also understands the impulse, changing five token allocations as follows &ndash;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s7">As initial hype fades, Pepe (PEPE) has now maintained a new red color, while Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues its long-term battle with the bears. In light of the recent struggles of meme coins, investors have become increasingly cautious when considering investment opportunities. One project that has stood out from the pack because of its utility is Sparklo.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY SPARKLO TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s10">Sparklo (SPRK) offers unrivaled utility to investors</p>
<p class="s7">Sparklo is developing the first blockchain platform that will allow both low and high-income earners to assess the precious metals industry by eliminating the obstacles that plague the traditional investment market. Using fractional NFTs, Sparklo will give investors the chance to own gold, silver, and platinum.</p>
<p class="s7">At current prices, gold has a market cap of $13.02 trillion, silver $1.3 trillion, and platinum$267.92 billion. Exploring these markets gives Sparklo an unrivaled utility. Sparklo will also collaborate with jewelry stores to provide investors with early access to some jewelry products before they are made available on the market.</p>
<p class="s7">Now in the second presale stage, Sparklo (SPRK) currently trades at $0.026 with up to 50% rewards on purchases. Given the potential of Sparklo, experts have predicted a price jump of up to 40x within the first year of launch.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY SPARKLO TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s10">The red Pepe (PEPE) color despite Bitfinex listing</p>
<p class="s7">Following an explosive performance early this month, Pepe (PEPE) has been sliding deeper into bear territory. As a popular meme coin, Pepe (PEPE) continues to receive support from crypto exchanges. Bitfinex has announced that Pepe (PEPE) will be listed on the exchange on May 22. Trading Pepe (PEPE) against US Dollar and Tether (USDT) pairs will open on May 24. </p>
<p class="s7">The massive Pepe (PEPE) rally was followed by an even bigger dump as investors cashed out their gains. Despite Bifinex announcing the listing of Pepe (PEPE) has lost more than 5% of its value in the last 24 hours. Over the last week, the price of Pepe (PEPE) has declined by 13%, making it one of the biggest losers. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY SPARKLO TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s10">John Richmond teases new Shiba Inu (SHIB) NFT hoodie</p>
<p class="s7">An equally popular meme coin, Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues to see more developments than Pepe (PEPE). John Richmond, the famous Italian-English fashion designer has announced that he will launch a new NFT hoodie collection exclusively for the Shiba Inu (SHIB) community. According to Richmond, the hoodies are part of the Cyberpunk LegendsLiveForever collection.</p>
<p class="s7">Like NFTs, each hoodie will be unique. The announcement has turned the negative sentiments of Shiba Inu (SHIB) positive. Over the last 24 hours, the price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) has gained 2.7%, pushing its price up to $0.000008778. However, in the long term, Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains bearish, losing 16% of its value in the last 30 days. The poor performance of meme coins has fueled the migration of investors to projects with more utility like Sparklo. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Investors are increasingly showing interest in the InQubeta (QUBE) presale, while Arbitrum(ARB) holders continue to see the value of their holdings drop. Presales and initial coin offerings (ICO) are known to excite investors, but InQubeta&rsquo;s presale is generating unprecedented interest as investors look to capitalize on a barrier-free opportunity to purchase equity in promising Artificial Intelligence (AI) startups.</p>
<p>AI is one of the fastest-growing technology fields, with total investments in the industry rising by over $80 billion from 2015 to 2021. That&rsquo;s a clear indicator that many traditional investors expect AI to be a significant part of everyday life in the future.</p>
<p>Many AI-powered devices that were once nothing more than a fantasy of novelists are now a common reality. AI-powered devices now clean floors in many homes, while some vehicle manufacturers have added self-driving features to their products. All this has occurred while AI technology still remains in its infancy.</p>
<p class="s8">InQubeta keeps trending upwards while other altcoins like Arbitrum lose value</p>
<p>InQubeta&rsquo;s unique platform deserves credit for the growth enjoyed during its presale. It allows anyone, to invest in AI startups without a need for Silicon Valley connections or other barriers associated with mainstream investment firms. The platform also makes it easier for AI startups to secure the funding needed for their projects.</p>
<p>Startups raise capital on InQubeta&rsquo;s platform by creating ERC20 QUBE tokens. These are fractionalized, deflationary non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that represent equity and other rewards in their companies. These tokens are then listed on the InQubeta marketplace where investors find and research startups with potential to invest in.</p>
<p>Investors purchase fractionalized QUBE tokens of startups they link with $QUBE tokens, the platform's native currency. This gives them equity in the company and other rewards like profit-sharing in some cases.</p>
<p>InQubeta&rsquo;s platform has deflationary protocols that help to push prices upwards. Buy and sell transactions with QUBE tokens are taxed at a 2% rate. The taxes generated are sent to a burn wallet to reduce the total number of available coins. The tax rate is 5% for $QUBE transactions, and it&rsquo;s used to fund a dedicated reward pool for investors who stake their coins.</p>
<p>InQubeta (QUBE) also allows investors to be part of the platform's governance, with the size of each investor&rsquo;s holdings deciding the authority of their voice. Investors can propose, discuss, and vote on ideas that affect the platform's protocols and future.</p>
<p class="s11">Visit InQubeta Presale</p>
<p class="s8">Arbitrum (ARB) release hasn&rsquo;t gone as planned</p>
<p>Arbitrum is built around the Ethereum (ETH) network &ndash; the second most popular cryptocurrency worldwide. ETH &nbsp;has lots of things going on for it like supporting smart contracts. However, Ethereum transaction fees have gotten outrageously high as its value grows.</p>
<p>Arbitrum has created a third-party solution for Ethereum&rsquo;s problems by building its platform on Ethereum&rsquo;s blockchain to speed up transactions and lower fees. It&rsquo;s emerged as a popular place for ETH holders to complete transactions.</p>
<p>Arbitrum released its new ARB governance token in March 2023, but the token hasn&rsquo;t seen significant growth since. Instead, prices have dropped by over 50% since setting an all-time high of $1.77 in April. Altcoins like Arbitrum have struggled to grow since the start of the InQubetapresale as investors can&rsquo;t resist the urge to be part of the AI revolution going on. Artificial intelligence has the potential to surpass the internet regarding its effects on how the world works, leading to a steady flow of investment capital into the industry and services that help its growth.</p>
<p class="s8">Summary</p>
<p>Many cryptocurrencies are predicted to experience significant growth this year, but Arbitrummight not be one of them despite making Ethereum transactions faster and cheaper. Other promising altcoins like InQubeta are drawing significant investments, keeping investments in coins like ARB low for now.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum (ETH) has solidified itself as one of the market's most popular and desirable crypto coins. However, as the recent lockup of ETH tokens hits new highs, investors are wondering about the coin's future movements.</p>
<p>While this is happening, a new player on the market &ndash; Collateral Network (COLT), is turning heads and making waves, with experts predicting a 3500% growth even while the token is still in its public presale.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Collateral Network Blows Investors Away with Incredible Gains</p>
<p>Collateral Network is one of the hottest projects in the crypto sphere right now. Set to revolutionize the lending industry, Collateral Network is the first decentralized lending platform on the blockchain that allows people to leverage their real-world assets in exchange for loans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's say you need to get a loan to fund an upcoming project, and you have a $10,000 watch. You can send that watch over to Collateral Network, where it will be valued and stored securely in a vault. Collateral Network will mint a 100% asset-backed NFT from your watch and sell it in fractions to other Collateral Network holders. Once you repay your loan, you'll get the watch back, and the NFT will be burned.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the people who fund the loans, i.e., buy fractions of the asset-backed NFTs, can create a diversified portfolio of multiple small loans and receive fixed-interest weekly payments from each loan. So, Collateral Network also allows lenders to create streams of passive income with competitive rates.</p>
<p>At the moment, this token is still in its public presale. Nonetheless, it's already providing gains for holders, as its initial presale price has already jumped from $0.01 to $0.014 in just a few weeks. Experts and analysts are predicting 3500% gains for the coin in the near future and an incredible 100x increase once the coin hits exchanges.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Is Buying Ethereum on eToro Worth It?</p>
<p>The Ethereum (ETH) price is continuing to see bearish reactions as the Ethereum lockup continues to rise. In an effort to boost the Ethereum value, Ethereum holders have been locking up their Ethereum coins in the past few weeks. Now, the total locked amount has reached a new high, with 19,375,242 Ethereum coins being locked away.</p>
<p>However, the lockup trend has yet to achieve its goal of boosting Ethereum value, and now investors are unsure where all of this will lead. Some experts are predicting a further decline in Ethereum prices in the future, with some saying that it could fall from its current trading price of $1,788.05 to $1,462.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum (ETH) has solidified itself as one of the market's most popular and desirable crypto coins. However, as the recent lockup of ETH tokens hits new highs, investors are wondering about the coin's future movements.</p>
<p>While this is happening, a new player on the market &ndash; Collateral Network (COLT), is turning heads and making waves, with experts predicting a 3500% growth even while the token is still in its public presale.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Collateral Network Blows Investors Away with Incredible Gains</p>
<p>Collateral Network is one of the hottest projects in the crypto sphere right now. Set to revolutionize the lending industry, Collateral Network is the first decentralized lending platform on the blockchain that allows people to leverage their real-world assets in exchange for loans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's say you need to get a loan to fund an upcoming project, and you have a $10,000 watch. You can send that watch over to Collateral Network, where it will be valued and stored securely in a vault. Collateral Network will mint a 100% asset-backed NFT from your watch and sell it in fractions to other Collateral Network holders. Once you repay your loan, you'll get the watch back, and the NFT will be burned.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the people who fund the loans, i.e., buy fractions of the asset-backed NFTs, can create a diversified portfolio of multiple small loans and receive fixed-interest weekly payments from each loan. So, Collateral Network also allows lenders to create streams of passive income with competitive rates.</p>
<p>At the moment, this token is still in its public presale. Nonetheless, it's already providing gains for holders, as its initial presale price has already jumped from $0.01 to $0.014 in just a few weeks. Experts and analysts are predicting 3500% gains for the coin in the near future and an incredible 100x increase once the coin hits exchanges.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Is Buying Ethereum on eToro Worth It?</p>
<p>The Ethereum (ETH) price is continuing to see bearish reactions as the Ethereum lockup continues to rise. In an effort to boost the Ethereum value, Ethereum holders have been locking up their Ethereum coins in the past few weeks. Now, the total locked amount has reached a new high, with 19,375,242 Ethereum coins being locked away.</p>
<p>However, the lockup trend has yet to achieve its goal of boosting Ethereum value, and now investors are unsure where all of this will lead. Some experts are predicting a further decline in Ethereum prices in the future, with some saying that it could fall from its current trading price of $1,788.05 to $1,462.</p>
<p>If you want to wait for the expected dip once it comes, you can buy Ethereum on eToro. However, at this time, it's not recommendable that you do so, as predictions aren't so good for the coin. So, you'll be much better off investing in the Collateral Network presale if you want to get maximum gains.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Whether by luck, good timing, or a fundamental belief in decentralized finance, hundreds, if not thousands of people, bought large amounts of Bitcoin and still hold them to date. As they are commonly known, Bitcoin whales exert significant influence over the market, with their activity influencing prices. </p>
<p>Bitcoin whales are always on the hunt for the next big thing. Many of them are now circling DigiToads, a unique memecoin that offers utility to users. The activity of whales is felt even for major coins with significant liquidity spread globally. Therefore, their entry into the memecoinspace with interest in DigiToads is noticeable. </p>
<p>Focus on DigiToads</p>
<p>This project is currently conducting a presale as it looks to proceed toward full launch. DigiToads is fast gathering momentum in the memecoin space as it looks to dislodge more established competitors. </p>
<p>At press time, DigiToads had raised over $4.25 million in the presale, which only commenced recently. This amount indicates the interest of some significant players in the crypto landscape in this emerging memecoin. </p>
<p>It might have a lot to do with DigiToads gradual increase in token pricing through the presale as it prepares for launch. Since the token sale started, prices have risen over 140%, with more planned increases in the pipeline. As they say, the early bird catches the worm. Crypto whales who have bought TOADS tokens are probably looking at the big picture in acquiring the coin in its early stages. </p>
<p>Memecoins are having a moment; again. Those who followed the last crypto rally two years ago remember how Dogecoin blew established projects off the ballpark in a short window. Well, Pepecoin has had a significant surge in the past month before tapering off a week ago. DigiToadsseeks to take up the mantle and take memecoins up a notch.</p>
<p>DigiToads Utility</p>
<p>The key to DigiToads aims is the addition of utility to the standard operating procedure of memecoins. Typical memecoins ride on the meme's popularity. it is pegged on to its logical conclusion. Pepecoin is a subset of the &ldquo;Pepe the Frog'' meme that has been a staple on the internet for a decade or more, especially on right-wing chat boards. This token took up the notoriety of this meme and got hot a few weeks ago, and has experienced some correction lately. </p>
<p>For DigiToads, the meme aspect holds but is not the end all be all of the projects. The team behind the project conceptualized a pay-to-earn (P2E) gaming ecosystem with the TOADS token at the heart of this ecosystem. TOADS is an ERC-20 token, meaning broad compatibility with Ethereum wallets and ease of trading. </p>
<p>The game itself takes place in a swamp metaverse where toads live. These toads catch flies for their nourishment and engage in various battles to secure their habitat. The battles can be intense, and the player must ensure they nourish their toads to be as strong as possible in preparation. Success in these battles means rewards to the player in the form of TOADs hence the play-to-earn concept. </p>
<p>Additionally, the players have a chance to accumulate several Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) collectibles as they navigate the game. These NFTs are unique and have inherent value. To protect the value of the NFTs collectively, DigiToads allows gamers to stake their NFTs in exchange for a small percentage of TOADS transaction fees collected by the project. Staking TOADS is also an option to ensure that one can participate in project governance moving forward. </p>
<p>Governance will be through a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), ensuring DigiToads retains a distributed network governance model. Besides sustainable governance, the project also has a commitment to real-world sustainability, with some of the profits donated to charities committed to saving rainforests. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Buy DigiToads Now &lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Markets follow whales</p>
<p>In an ocean, the big fish change the behavior of other fish when they come into an area. Whales may not have the stereotypical fear of sharks but are large enough to cause a reaction in the surrounding waters. </p>
<p>Whether you think the role of crypto whales in the markets is positive or not, there is no doubt that their activity moves markets. For instance, the activity of the four biggest Bitcoin wallets that collectively own over 3 % of all Bitcoin in circulation is enough to tilt markets. Notably, these four are rarely active and have not rocked Bitcoin prices as much as possible. Interest in a new token like TOADS is an endorsement of the fundamentals of this project. The markets will certainly be watching this space for their subsequent moves. </p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Whales purchasing TOADS tokens is indicative of the potential of these projects. Rarely do these crypto powerhouses act for charitable ends, and their moves often come upon calculated projections. The DigiToads launch is certainly something to look forward to shortly. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>DCG announced on Thursday the closure of its prime brokerage subsidiary TradeBlock. The company cites broad economic concerns and the uncertain regulatory climate in the US. </p>
<p>Digital Currency Group (DCG) announced on Thursday that it would officially start the process of shutting down its institutional trading platform on May 31, Bloomberg reports.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Barry Silbert&rsquo;s crypto conglomerate, Digital Currency Group, is shuttering its TradeBlock institutional trading platform https://t.co/duE4YnknrR</p>
&mdash; Bloomberg Crypto (@crypto) May 25, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the venture capital conglomerate told Bloomberg that concerns over the broader economic climate and an uncertain regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies in the US drove the decision to shutter TradeBlock&rsquo;s operations.</p>

<p>Due to the state of the broader economy and prolonged crypto winter, along with the challenging regulatory environment for digital assets in the US, we made the decision to sunset the institutional trading platform side of the business.</p>

Challenging Times for DCG
<p>Established in 2011, the company was acquired by DCG&rsquo;s crypto-focused media platform CoinDesk in 2021. CoinDesk retained only its index data business which it later rebranded to CoinDesk Indices, Finance Magnates reports.</p>
<p>DCG has been under severe pressure after one of its subsidiaries, Genesis Global Trading, halted customer withdrawals in November and went bankrupt, reportedly owing creditors $3 billion.</p>
<p>The company is further facing pressure over a lending product called &ldquo;Earn&rdquo;, which Genesis offered in partnership with crypto exchange Gemini.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, it was reported that DCG missed a payment concerning a $900 million loan made by Gemini to Genesis. The crypto exchange warned earlier in the month that if DCG could not make the required loan repayment or restructure its debt, the company would be at risk of defaulting on its obligations.</p>
<p>The conglomerate further revealed in its Q4 2022 investor report that it suffered losses worth $1.1 billion due to the collapse of Three Arrows Capital. DCG is reportedly 3AC&rsquo;s largest creditor, which owes around $2.36 billion in funds.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Binance crypto exchange has started its NFT journey by launching a loan feature, which will allow users to use their NFTs as collateral to borrow cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p>
Borrow Crypto Against NFT
<p>The move marks the entry of the world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency exchange into the NFT lending space. After launching its NFT marketplace in June 2021, the latest NFT lending feature will give users easy and quick access to funds without having to sell their NFTs, allowing them to borrow cryptocurrencies by just putting their digital assets as collateral.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Head of Product at Binance, Mayur Kama, announced the news, saying,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Binance NFT is building! We&rsquo;ve added many features that make it a one-stop shop for NFT trading and financial services for our community. We already have low fees and the Binance peace of mind; now NFT Loans will add a new form of liquidity for NFT holders, allowing them to participate in the market without letting go of their precious NFTs.&rdquo;</p>

DeFi Benefits For Users
<p>The feature will allow users to initially borrow only Ether (ETH) against NFTs that have been marked as &ldquo;blue-chip.&rdquo; These include popular digital asset collections like the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC), Azuki, and Doodles. Collectors with NFTs from any of these collections will be able to put their assets as collateral and borrow ETH.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The announcement from the company has claimed that more NFT collections will be added to the &ldquo;blue-chip&rdquo; list, broadening the borrowing opportunities for its users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The feature also allows users to tap into the DeFi-related benefits in the Binance NFT community, as it operates on a &ldquo;Peer to Pool&rdquo; mechanism, where data is sourced from multiple providers, including the oracle service Chainlink and the OpenSea NFT marketplace. The Binance NFT marketplace acts like a loan pool, and the floor price of the collateralized NFTs decides the amount of ETH a user can borrow.&nbsp;</p>
No Gas fees
<p>One notable advantage of the Binance NFT loan feature is the absence of gas fees or Ethereum transaction fees, making it a cost-effective solution for users seeking liquidity. In addition, the interest rates on NFT loans currently stand at 7.91% per annum, with loan-to-value ratios ranging from 40% to 60%, as stated on the Binance NFT website.</p>
<p>Binance's foray into NFT lending further expands its NFT offerings, complementing its NFT marketplace that was introduced in April 2021. Since its launch, Binance has continually added features to enhance user experience, including the recent integration of Ordinals, Bitcoin-based NFTs, alongside existing blockchain support for Ethereum, Polygon, and Binance's native BNB Chain.</p>

<p>US-based Gemini announced it will run its European operations out of Dublin, Ireland. Cameron Winklevoss shared the news via his Twitter feed on Thursday as American crypto exchanges scramble to widen operations amid the intensifying regulatory crackdown in the US.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Awesome meeting this morning with @LeoVaradkar, the Prime Minister of Ireland.

</p>
<p>Bloomberg reports Gemini cited Dublin&rsquo;s thriving start-up culture as a pull factor for the exchange to set up its European operations there. After the European Union&rsquo;s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation was approved last week, several crypto firms are considering a shift away from the US.</p>
Gemini Is the First Crypto Exchange to Register as a VASP in Ireland
<p>Leo Varadkar, Prime Minister of Ireland, congratulated Gemini on Twitter.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Congratulations @Gemini -the first firm registered by the Central Bank of Ireland as a Virtual Asset Service Provider.

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Winklevoss-owned crypto exchange Gemini Trust Co. will establish its European headquarters in Dublin, Ireland. </p>
<p>US-based Gemini announced it will run its European operations out of Dublin, Ireland. Cameron Winklevoss shared the news via his Twitter feed on Thursday as American crypto exchanges scramble to widen operations amid the intensifying regulatory crackdown in the US.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Awesome meeting this morning with @LeoVaradkar, the Prime Minister of Ireland.

</p>
<p>Bloomberg reports Gemini cited Dublin&rsquo;s thriving start-up culture as a pull factor for the exchange to set up its European operations there. After the European Union&rsquo;s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation was approved last week, several crypto firms are considering a shift away from the US.</p>
Gemini Is the First Crypto Exchange to Register as a VASP in Ireland
<p>Leo Varadkar, Prime Minister of Ireland, congratulated Gemini on Twitter.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Congratulations @Gemini -the first firm registered by the Central Bank of Ireland as a Virtual Asset Service Provider.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has recently introduced a series of stringent rules that are set to reshape the landscape of virtual asset trading within the city.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While offering a pathway for platforms to apply for licences starting June 1, the SFC also imposed restrictions on air drops and stablecoins, along with other requirements such as a 12-month track record for tokens and increased capital regulations for exchanges. As Hong Kong strives to establish itself as a global hub for virtual assets it is committed to a tight regulatory regime.</p>
Opening Doors for Virtual Asset Trading
<p>Effective from June 1, the SFC's new rules dictate that platforms engaged in virtual asset trading can now apply for licences. This move aims to establish a more structured and regulated environment for investors and traders. However, the SFC has also made it clear that virtual asset service providers (VASPs) who do not plan to obtain licences should initiate an orderly closure of their operations in Hong Kong.</p>
Striving for Transparency
<p>To ensure investor protection, tokens seeking listing on exchanges must now have a minimum 12-month track record. This requirement serves as a gatekeeping measure to ensure that only established and reputable tokens find their way into the trading ecosystem. Additionally, VASPs are now obligated to conduct thorough due diligence on tokens before listing them, enhancing transparency and mitigating risks.</p>
Capital Requirements and Reporting Obligations
<p>The new regulations introduce capital requirements for exchanges, mandating a minimum capital of HK$5,000,000 (US$640,000). Furthermore, exchanges must disclose their available and required liquid capital, outstanding bank loans, advances, and credit facilities, as well as provide a monthly profit and loss analysis to the SFC. These measures aim to enhance financial stability and promote responsible operations within the virtual asset trading space.</p>
Towards a Global Virtual Assets Hub
<p>Hong Kong's recent regulatory actions are part of a larger strategy to position itself as a prominent global hub for virtual assets. Investors will be closely observing how these regulations shape the market and also serve as an indicator of China's willingness to engage with the wider crypto industry. While crypto remains banned in mainland China, Hong Kong's progress may provide insights into potential shifts in China's regulatory landscape.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida has made promises to protect the world of digital assets, while simultaneously dismantling the concept of a central bank digital currency (CBDC).&nbsp;</p>
Protecting Crypto: A Pillar of DeSantis' Agenda
<p>Governor DeSantis has emerged as an important voice for the crypto industry, and much more so now that he has thrown his hat into the ring as a Republican candidate for 2024. He has said that he is committed to protecting the rights of crypto holders and has pledged to encourage a regulatory framework that promotes innovation.</p>
<p>Unlike many others in the US political arena, DeSantis understands the immense value crypto brings to the table. By fostering collaboration between the government and the crypto industry, he aims to position Florida as a global hub for blockchain technology, attracting investment and nurturing a flourishing ecosystem.</p>
The Demise of CBDC: DeSantis' Radical Stance
<p>Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) have been a topic of fervent discussion within the crypto sphere. While several countries are looking into developing their own CBDCs, Governor DeSantis has taken a firm stance against them. He believes that such centralised control over digital currencies contradicts the fundamental principles of decentralisation and poses a grave threat to individual privacy and financial sovereignty.</p>
<p>DeSantis argues that the adoption of CBDCs would grant governments excessive power, enabling them to monitor citizens' financial transactions with unprecedented scrutiny. To counter this potential encroachment on personal liberties, he is determined to dismantle any attempts at introducing a CBDC within Florida's borders.</p>
Bitcoin's Fate Under Biden: A Warning of Impending Doom?
<p>As the political landscape continues to evolve, Governor DeSantis has expressed concerns over the future of Bitcoin under President Biden's administration. Citing potential regulatory hurdles and increased government intervention, DeSantis warns of a bleak outlook for the flagship cryptocurrency if Biden secures a second term.</p>
<p>While some may view this prediction as politically motivated, DeSantis insists that it stems from a genuine apprehension for the principles that underpin Bitcoin's success. He emphasises the importance of preserving the decentralised nature of cryptocurrencies and argues that excessive regulation could stifle innovation and hinder the industry's potential to empower individuals worldwide.</p>

With the help of deep learning algorithms like GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), researchers are developing AI models that can generate realistic and original content. ChatGPT (Generative Pre-train Transformer) has elevated the AI trend and broadened the vision of people toward AI, the conversation with ChatGPT is as human-like as it can be.</p><p>Trading has been one of the centerpieces of the financial markets and the broader economy. Trading helps to establish the market price of an asset, security and crypto itself. Trading also creates liquidity in the market by providing a mechanism for investors to buy and sell assets quickly and easily. Therefore the demand for AI in trading has never been higher, in crypto trading where everything happens at such a lightning pace, human productivity has been the limiting factor where evidence of increasing reliance on bot has been high. The revolution will be the implementation of AI that can be a better human with less emotion and productivity of a bot.</p><p>TradeGDT (Trading Generative Data Transformer) is an upgraded version of a big data quantitative trading bot combined with AI. By combining the ChatGPT plug-in, it can communicate with users more intelligently and flexibly. Users can communicate with TradeGDT to execute orders, and even prompt users to be alert to the pairing dynamics Information, and through AI pattern learning, TradeGDT can analyze and study user data, dynamic trade model, identify the profit model belonging to the trader, and then formulate a set of trading models for automation execution, while becoming the trader's AI smart trading assistant a better version of the trader itself.</p><p>TraderDAO team has been engaging in implementing AI in crypto trading since the start of 2022.

Traders just need to perform trading to mint $POT and enjoy the fee sharing premium of the entire platform. The minting of each $POT requires a corresponding fee coming from trading fee rebate. Therefore, $POT is minted with 1:1 real yield asset backed, and the $POT treasury will grow bigger in value as the market continues to add new trades in, where these trades will provide data for AI pattern learning, powering the development of TradeGDT.</p><p>$POT is the utility token that incentivises AI training where the $HOT token is the governance token of TraderDAO. $HOT is deeply rooted in the heart of TradeGDT utility, the fuel that is burned off to use or operate all the coming functions and features of TradeGDT AI. TradeGDT will be traders' smart trading assistance that revolutionize trading by improved decision making, increased efficiency, reduced risk, improved portfolio management, faster and more accurate trade execution.

<p>LBank Exchange, the global digital asset trading platform, has listed Ordinal Pepe (OPEPE). The OPEPE/USDT trading pair went live on LBank on May 26. Ordinal Pepe (OPEPE) is the first Pepe token to be issued on the Bitcoin blockchain. This dynamic fusion combines the famous Pepe frog meme with the unrivaled security of Bitcoin.</p>

Uniting these two thriving phenomena into a single memecoin on Bitcoin was the logical evolution of things.</p>

Offering no tax on buy or sell transactions, complete liquidity lock, and an abundant supply of 1 quadrillion tokens, OPEPE aspires to be the most desirable memecoin on the market.</p>
<p>OPEPE, powered by its community, seeks to replicate the joy and rewards that Pepe brought to its fans. The vision for OPEPE is to dominate the meme space and achieve deep liquidity through becoming available on leading exchanges. Backed by an innovative strategy and a tight-knit community, the Ordinals Pepe team firmly believe they can realize this ambition.</p>
<p>About OPEPE Token</p>
<p>Based on the ERC-20 token standard, OPEPE is a Bitcoin-based memecoin with a total supply of 1 quadrillion (1,000,000,000,000,000). The token was listed on LBank Exchange at 10:00 UTC on May 26, 2023. It aims to become the preeminent memecoin, combining the humor and memetic power of Pepe the frog with the security and reliability of Bitcoin.</p>

DeSo puts the ownership back in the hands of users, not platforms.

Instead, it supports a narrow set of social-oriented features that it implements on bare metal, using custom indexes that every node builds during consensus when it syncs from its peers. This allows the DeSo blockchain to reach highly-scalable storage capabilities that are unparalleled by any general-purpose blockchain. For instance, the cost of 1 GB of on-chain storage on DeSo is as low as 1 DeSo, whereas even the best existing smart contract infrastructures require millions ($1,000,000+) of dollars to achieve the same.</p><p>With DeSo, people can now imagine, build and experience the next generation of web3 social.

Additionally, they&rsquo;ve launched the groundbreaking MegaSwap, a anonymous no login cross-chain swapper for crypto, and OpenFund, which makes it easy for crypto projects to launch startups and get funded in just a few clicks.</p><p>Looking forward, they are gearing up for their transition to Revolution Proof-of-Stake, a monumental development that will enhance energy efficiency by 99% and establish DeSo as one of the most deflationary protocols in existence.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>According to court filings published on Thursday, Crypto Consortium Celsius has won the bid to acquire bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Fahrenheit consortium beat fellow bidder NovaWulf, with the Blockchain Recovery Investment Consortium shortlisted as a backup.&nbsp;</p>
Fahrenheit&rsquo;s Successful Bid&nbsp;
<p>According to court filings, Celsius Network&rsquo;s assets were previously valued at $2 billion. Fahrenheit&rsquo;s winning consortium is backed by Arrington Capital, mining company US Bitcoin Corp, Steven Kokinos, Ravi Kaza, and Proof Group. With the bid secured, the consortium will acquire Celsius&rsquo;s staked cryptocurrencies, along with its institutional loan portfolio, mining unit, and additional alternative investments. Additionally, the consortium must pay a deposit of $10 million within three days to clinch the deal. Fahrenheit will also be required to provide the management team, capital, and technology to establish and operate the new regulatorily compliant public company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The deal will also see the newly formed company receive a significant amount of liquid cryptocurrency. This amount is speculated to be between $450 and $500 million. US Bitcoin Corp will also lead the construction of numerous Bitcoin mining facilities, including a 100-megawatt plant. In an announcement, Alan Carr and David Barse, members of the Special Committee of the Board, stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are very pleased that our competitive auction process produced a positive result for customers, including, most prominently, hundreds of millions of dollars in lower management fee savings and increased liquid cryptocurrency distributions to Celsius&rsquo; customers. We appreciate the robust interest that the Celsius platform has received from competing bidders and look forward to working with Fahrenheit to expedite the restructuring and distribute recoveries to creditors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They further added,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The dynamic engagement in our auction provided us with excellent options for our exit from chapter 11. We are grateful for the collaboration of the Committee, and with our path now set, we are looking forward to enabling our customers to move forward from this process.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

Regulatory Approval Awaited&nbsp;
<p>While the bid has been accepted by Celsius and a committee of its creditors, it still requires regulatory approval before it can be finalized. Martin Glenn, the Bankruptcy Court Judge, had already warned of regulatory roadblocks that could hamper the acquisition of Celsius, similar to how it had scuppered a similar deal. For context, the Judge was referring to the agreement between Binance US and Voyager. After Federal officials opposed the deal, Binance US had to terminate its purchase of bankrupt crypto lender Voyager&rsquo;s $1 billion in assets. Binance cited an uncertain and hostile regulatory climate for scuppering the deal.&nbsp;</p>
Celsius and BRIC
<p>Celsius had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July 2022 after it emerged that the lender had a $1.2 billion hole in its balance sheet. Initially, digital asset investment firm Novawulf was announced as the winning bidder but eventually lost out. However, Celsius also announced that it had secured a backup bid from the Blockchain Recovery Investment Consortium (BRIC). The backup would act as a contingency plan should there be any hiccups. Celsius announced the backup bid on its Twitter handle, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Earlier today, the Celsius auction concluded, and Fahrenheit was selected as the winning bid. The BRIC bid was selected as the backup bid. The Committee appreciates the efforts of Celsius and all bidders for their efforts, which generated significant value for Celsius users. The Committee will share more info a lot about the winning bid and backup bid soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the event of BRIC having to step in, it would be required to establish a publicly traded mining business, giving Celsius creditors complete ownership of equity interests and a potential management contract with GlobalXDigital.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The silence emanating from Multichain&rsquo;s leadership has amplified rumors, leading to significant unease and uncertainty among protocol users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At present, several of Multichain&rsquo;s cross-chain pathways remain down, leading to a major pile-up of transactions on the protocol.&nbsp;</p>
Multichain&rsquo;s Radio Silence
<p>The radio silence from the Multichain team has left users searching for answers, with the protocol currently holding $1.5 billion in total value locked (TVL). Multichain face a fifth day of outages and transactions that are in limbo, primarily due to multiple cross-chain pathways that are still offline. These include Polygon zkEVM, Kava, and zkSync. Initially, the team stated that this was caused due to an upgrade that was being patched. However, this explanation was revised, with the cause outlined as an ambiguous explanation of &ldquo;force majeure.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The uncertainty and radio silence comes against the backdrop of unverified rumors circulating on Twitter that the protocol&rsquo;s core leadership could possibly be under arrest in China. Co-founder of Multichain, DJ Qian, took to Twitter, stating he had asked Multichain CEO Zhaojun and its founding partner Xu Guochang if they could provide any help or explanation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From yesterday to today, I received a lot of greetings. Many people sent messages asking me if I was okay. Thank you for your concern. Of course, I&rsquo;m fine. At the same time, I also hope that there is nothing serious about multichain. Although I am not ashamed of what Zhaojun did before, after all, I brought Zhaojun and Guochang into the industry. I asked Guochang for some information to see if he could provide technical or other help. Well, the most important thing is the safety of user assets and the safety of people.&rdquo;</p>

Leadership Under Arrest?&nbsp;
<p>With rumors of the team&rsquo;s arrest circulating on Twitter, Multichain&rsquo;s VP of Strategic Partnerships stated in a Telegram group message that he was not aware if Chinese authorities had actually detained the protocol&rsquo;s leadership. Protocol CEO Zhaojun did not reply to any messages on the group in question nor to direct queries. The project&rsquo;s Discord server and other Telegram groups are dealing with similar uncertainty, with no updates about the project or its future. All community members have been told to wait for any further updates.&nbsp;</p>
MULTI Token Plummets&nbsp;
<p>With the uncertainty surrounding the project, the protocol&rsquo;s native MULTI token has continued its downward trajectory. With users complaining that their transactions had been stuck since Sunday, the team assured them that their funds were safe and they were working to resolve the issue. David Who, a community manager with Multichain, had given users an update, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At this stage, we can&rsquo;t be sure when it will be fully fixed. However, our user&rsquo;s funds are safe, and pending transactions would &ldquo;pass through automatically and instantly&rdquo; after resolution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, with no resolution, the token&rsquo;s price has continued to drop. Currently, the MULTI token is down over 28% and is trading at $3.80.&nbsp;</p>
Other Projects React&nbsp;
<p>Several projects have responded to the situation unfolding at Multichain. Coinflux Network became the latest to respond, stating that it had suspended Multichain&rsquo;s co-mint privileges as a precautionary measure. This would prevent Multichain from minting new tokens on the project&rsquo;s blockchain. Furthermore, Coinflux also added that it would work with users to mitigate any losses that may arise. Crypto Investment firm HashKey Group also revealed that it had moved $250,000 from Multichain to Gate.io. Meanwhile, Tron founder Justin Sun also revealed that he had withdrawn 470,000 of the USDD stablecoin from the protocol.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency exchange Binance also swung into action, announcing that it was suspending deposits for 10 bridged tokens following days of transactions being stuck in limbo. This impacted several token pairs, including Polkastarter (POLS), Alpaca Finance (ALPACA), Travala.com (AVA), Spell (SPELL), Fantom (FTM), Alchemy (ACH), Beefy (BIFI), SuperVerse (SUPER), Harvest Finance (FARM) and DeXe (DEXE). Binance&rsquo;s announcement will impact users of bridged tokens on Ethereum, Avalanche, BNB Smart Chain, and Fantom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fantom Foundation also moved to limit its exposure, withdrawing $2.4 million in liquidity of the MULTI token on the SushiSwap DEX. Andre Cronje, Fantom Foundation Director, explained that Fantom had to act due to the uncertainty surrounding Multichain and was withdrawing the funds out of caution. Cronje added,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No point to LP at times of uncertainty. You can see in the wallet the funds haven&rsquo;t been sold. As soon as Multichain is able to release a statement around this and clear it up, we will LP again.&rdquo;</p>
