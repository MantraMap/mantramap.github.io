					<description><![CDATA[The Web3 industry offers a diverse range of services, creating a dynamic landscape for individuals. A notable development in this space is the recent partnership announcement by Horizon, the creators of Sequence, aimed at redefining Web3 infrastructure. This collaboration has had a significant impact, particularly on Polygon&#8217;s governance token MATIC, which experienced a notable increase of nearly 3% within the past 24 hours. This bolstering of the infrastructure signifies a positive step forward for the Web3 ecosystem. Source: Coingecko This development came a day after Polygon’s blog post detailing the release of the v0.9 Testnet for Polygon’s Supernets. Once the final release of Supernets is launched, this partnership will surely affect the dominance of Polygon in the Web3 space.  Web3: Scalability, Seamlessness For Developers On Polygon The seamless integration of Sequence’s smart wallet and infrastructure stack on Polygon Supernets will pull business enterprises into the ecosystem. Polygon Supernets are custom-built blockchains for specific apps. The most important of these customizations is a custom blockspace, ensuring that the user experience isn’t affected by bumps in activity on-chain.  Sequence’s all-in-one development stack is the main attraction for both developers and investors. It is a complete package, covering tokens and NFTs to SDKs, the stack will fuel on-chain development as the release of Polygon Supernets nears.  To further push growth, both Polygon and Sequence will offer credits to incentivize developers to build on the platform. In doing so, the strategic alliance will have a strong effect on how quickly the Web3 infrastructure will improve.  .@AntimetalCloud launched its AI-powered cloud cost optimization platform, with an incredible $4.3M seed funding round led by @hiFramework☁️ 👉🏾We&#8217;re thrilled to have invested in Antimetal’s vision, driving innovation &#38; empowering the tech ecosystem More: https://t.co/beRTvlkVRE pic.twitter.com/TxJdJN76qv — Polygon (Labs) (@0xPolygonLabs) May 17, 2023 This isn’t the only move by Polygon to improve Web3 infrastructure. Recently, Polygon invested in Antimetal, a cloud-based platform, in a seed funding round led by Framework Ventures. With Polygon’s entry into the world of cloud infrastructure, we might see more developments in the space led by Polygon itself in the near future.  MATIC total market cap at $8.09 billion.

However, the current market structure is bearish, supporting the bears in the short to medium term. Thus, MATIC bulls should defend $0.8339 as much as possible.  With on and off-chain developments backing the token, MATIC might see a return to $1 in the coming days or weeks. Despite this, investors should be cautious in the short to medium term. Ethereum’s recent upward swing caused the altcoin market to follow as well.  If these price swings continue to move upward, MATIC’s rise to $1 is secured. With the market showing signs of strength, investors and traders should be able to enjoy gains in the long term.  -Featured image from DailyCoin]]></description>

Ethereum is currently facing many hurdles near the $1,840 resistance zone. The price is trading below $1,820 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,825 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $1,825 and $1,840 resistance levels. Ethereum Price Faces Uphill Task Ethereum’s price remained in a bearish zone below the $1,840 zone. ETH started a fresh decline below the $1,800 level and showed a few bearish signs, similar to Bitcoin. The price even declined below the $1,780 level. A low is formed near $1,772 and the price is now correcting losses. There was a move above the $1,800 level. The price cleared the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,834 swing high to the   $1,772 low. Ether is now trading above $1,820 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,825 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Immediate resistance is near the $1,820 level. It is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,834 swing high to the $1,772 low.

					<description><![CDATA[The MATIC price recently broke above a key resistance level, indicating a positive development. However, its price appreciation over the past week has been modest, with only a 2% increase. MATIC has remained close to a critical support line on its daily chart despite the breakout. The technical outlook suggests that recovery might take some time as the bears dominate the price. Both demand and accumulation have decreased in the daily timeframe. Related Reading: Bitcoin Binary CDD Stays Low, Here’s What This Means While MATIC currently sits above an important resistance, the absence of buyer support could lead to a significant loss in value before any recovery occurs on the daily chart. If the bears exert further pressure, MATIC will likely resume sideways trading, fluctuating between $0.81 and $0.84. The uncertainty in the Bitcoin price movement, as it fluctuates from $27,000 and retraces from that level, has impacted altcoins, weakening their respective price action. The MATIC market capitalization has fallen, indicating a higher level of selling activity than buying activity. MATIC Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, MATIC was trading at $0.86. It successfully surpassed the $0.84 resistance level in the short term, but buyer sentiment remained weak. The coin&#8217;s next significant resistance is $0.87, and breaching this level could initiate a recovery trend. However, if sellers persist, the altcoin could drop toward $0.81 and potentially below $0.80. The key for the bulls to regain control of the price lies in MATIC, staying above $0.86 in the upcoming trading sessions. The trading volume of MATIC in the last session was low, indicating a lack of buying strength. Technical Analysis MATIC faced challenges in generating strong buying support throughout April and May, resulting in reduced demand. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicated a decline, with the indicator remaining below 40, highlighting the dominant presence of sellers in the market. Furthermore, the price dropped below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, indicating that sellers were driving the price momentum. However, if MATIC surpasses the $0.87 level, it will trade above the 20-SMA line. In contrast, the altcoin exhibited buy signals on the daily chart, albeit with a diminishing size and strength. The presence of green histograms on the Awesome Oscillator indicated buy signals for the altcoin, reflecting price momentum and potential reversals.

Additionally, the Bollinger Bands, which measure price volatility and the likelihood of price fluctuations, remained narrow and wide. However, the bands had a slight convergence, suggesting that the price may not undergo significant volatility or fluctuation in the immediate trading sessions.

					<description><![CDATA[An intriguing development has caught the crypto community&#8217;s attention as a Bitcoin whale deposited a substantial amount of BTC on the world&#8217;s largest crypto exchange, Binance. This significant move has sparked speculation about potential selling pressure and the subsequent impact on Bitcoin&#8217;s price. Notably, the massive deposit was recorded when Bitcoin showed signs of a rebound following its recent losses in the past week. Whale Moves BTC To Binance According to renowned on-chain analyst Lookonchain, a notable Bitcoin whale made a deposit of 1,750 BTC which is worth over $48 Million, on the Binance exchange a few hours ago. This occurrence has raised concerns among market observers, as large transactions can indicate imminent selling pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin whale moves BTC to Binance exchange The on-chain data analyst further reveals this whale has a history of triggering sudden moves in the price action. On April 21, the same individual deposited a staggering 5,791 BTC (equivalent to $163 million), leading to a subsequent 3% drop in Bitcoin&#8217;s price within five hours. Notably, Lookonchain says this whale has a history of buying large amounts of Bitcoin. The analyst reports that the whale initially acquired 10,000 BTC, valued at $171 million, on December 1, 2022, when Bitcoin was priced at $17,101. And as of now, the whale has a current Bitcoin holding balance of 2,459 BTC and an approximate profit of $107 million. Bitcoin Reaction: Analyzing the Possibilities It is worth noting that the Bitcoin market reaction to this whale can be quite unpredictable as the large investor alone might have a different reason to move the coins besides selling them. However, given the historical evidence of price movements following whale deposits on exchanges, Bitcoin will likely experience a spike in volatility soon. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Ready For A Breakout? Glassnode Co-Founder Weighs In Particularly, If the past is any indication, there is a possibility of a short-term dip in Bitcoin&#8217;s price if the whale sells its BTC deposit. The sudden influx of 1,750 BTC into the exchange may trigger a cascade of sell-offs from other market participants, leading to a temporary downturn. Regardless, Bitcoin&#8217;s price has experienced a quick spike in the past 24 hours, up by 1%. Bitcoin has shown possible signs of rebound along with the rest of the crypto market. BTC has surged from low trading below $27,000 yesterday to trading for $27,406 at the time of writing. Before the bullish signs, BTC has since been in a downward trend in the past weeks, down by more than 10% in the past month. Interestingly, BTC trading volume remains below $10 billion despite the whale movement. Featured image from, Unsplash, Chart from TradingView]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Uniswap Labs, a leading decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, has recently conducted a survey to understand the motivations and barriers of US-based retail users towards DeFi. The survey received 1,860 responses, including non-crypto, centralized finance (CeFi), and DeFi users. The survey revealed that despite the bear market backdrop, nearly half of CeFi users expressed an interest in experimenting with DeFi protocols in the next 12 months. This finding is encouraging as it indicates a growing interest in DeFi among traditional finance users, who are willing to learn and explore the possibilities of on-chain activity. Related Reading: Internet Computer (ICP) Dips, Will Bearish Momentum Persist?  Uniswap Survey Points to A Shift from CeFi To DeFi However, the survey also highlighted that complexity, lack of understanding, and costs are the main barriers preventing CeFi users from using DeFi platforms for all their cryptocurrency trades. This finding underscores the importance of providing educational material, improved user experience, and support to overcome the learning curve associated with DeFi. But how is Uniswap Labs simplifying DeFi for CeFi users? Seamless User Interface: Uniswap Labs has a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily navigate the platform and execute trades with a few clicks. This contrasts traditional DeFi platforms, which can be overwhelming for new users. Automated Market Making (AMM): Uniswap Labs uses an AMM system that eliminates the need for order books and allows users to easily swap tokens at a fair market price, simplifying the trading process and eliminating the need for users to understand complex trading concepts. Self-Custody: Uniswap Labs strongly emphasizes self-custody, meaning users have complete control over their assets and do not rely on centralized custodians. While this may seem daunting initially, Uniswap Labs provides educational resources and support to help users understand the benefits of self-custody. With this, Uniswap Labs, which builds products to onboard people directly to DeFi, aims to bridge the gap between CeFi and DeFi by focusing on UX and considering the first steps as a gateway into the broader crypto ecosystem. By doing so, Uniswap Labs seeks to provide CeFi users with a more transparent, self-custodial, and publicly verifiable alternative to centralized finance platforms that often lack accountability and transparency. Transaction Fees And Costs Identified As Biggest Barriers Transaction fees and costs were also identified as notable barriers to entry. However, as Ethereum continues to scale and layer 2 solutions see greater adoption, DeFi will become more economically accessible for price-sensitive users, according to Uniswap’s blog post. The survey also revealed that better educational resources and increased user support would increase willingness among CeFi users to trade on DeFi platforms. Products targeting this CeFi segment have already invested in these educational resources. Uniswap Labs has assembled one of the few customer support teams in crypto, considered one of the best in the industry. For this, Uniswap Labs is exploring layer 2 scaling solutions that will significantly reduce transaction fees and increase the speed of transactions. This will make DeFi more economically accessible and user-friendly for price-sensitive users.

The platform aims to simplify and abstract the complexities unique to crypto without compromising on the ideals of self-custody and transparency. As the industry continues to grow, it is important to prioritize user education and support to help users build their knowledge base and grow their confidence.

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) has stayed low recently. Here&#8217;s what this says about the current market. Bitcoin Binary CDD Has Remained At Very Low Levels Recently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, this indicator attained high values during the 2021 bull run. To understand the CDD metric, the concept of &#8220;coin days&#8221; needs to be looked at first. Whenever 1 BTC stays stationary on the blockchain for 1 day, it accumulates 1 &#8220;coin day.&#8221; If a coin that has remained unmoved on the network for a while, meaning that it has accumulated a certain number of coin days, is now suddenly transferred, its coin days counter would naturally reset back to zero. The coin days it had previously been carrying are said to be &#8220;destroyed.&#8221; The CDD indicator measures the total number of coin days being reset throughout the network on any given day. When this indicator has a high value, it implies that a large number of coin days are being reset in the market currently. Generally, this kind of trend is a sign of movement from the &#8220;long-term holders&#8221; (LTHs). This group includes investors that have been holding their BTC since at least 155 days ago, so these holders tend to accumulate large numbers of coin days. Because of this reason, whenever they make transfers, the CDD registers a spike. In the context of the current discussion, the CDD itself isn&#8217;t of interest, but a modified version of it called the Binary CDD is. This indicator basically tells us how the CDD currently compares with the historical average value of the metric. As is already obvious from its name, this indicator can only attain two values: 0 and 1. It has a value of 0 if the CDD is below the historical average, while it&#8217;s 1 when the metric is above it. Related Reading: Dogecoin, Shiba Inu Whales Move Massive Amounts, Dumping Going On? Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 7-day average Bitcoin Binary CDD over the last few years: The value of the metric seems to have been low in recent days &#124; Source: Glassnode on Twitter As shown in the above graph, the 7-day average Bitcoin Binary CDD has had a pretty low value for a while now. This suggests that there hasn&#8217;t been any significant destruction of coin days in the market recently. Naturally, this means that the LTHs haven&#8217;t been making any moves out of the ordinary, despite the price observing a notable increase during the last few months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Signal: Whales Accumulate 84,897 BTC The LTHs are generally the most resolute bunch in the market, so transfers from them can have significant implications for the sector since they are a sign that even these holders may have been forced to sell. The Bitcoin bull run during the first half of 2021 saw the 7-day average Binary CDD stay near 1, implying that the LTHs had been selling in full force. As this hasn&#8217;t been the case in the rally so far, it appears that the current profits aren&#8217;t enough to move these diamond hands, and they are likely expecting better opportunities later on. These investors continuing to hold such a bullish conviction can be constructive for the price in the long term.

Here&#8217;s a closer look at what you should think about: Read the Bitcoin Casino Bonus Terms and Conditions Thoroughly review the terms and conditions associated with the bonus because this section outlines important details that can impact your gaming experience. Pay close attention to wagering requirements, which specify the number of times you must wager the bonus amount before being eligible to withdraw any winnings. Additionally, be aware of restrictions, which may limit the maximum amount you can cash out from bonus winnings. Other limitations, such as casino games restrictions and time limitations, may also be mentioned in the terms and conditions. Know The Different Casino Bonuses Bitcoin casinos offer various types of bonuses, each catering to different player preferences and playing styles. Consider your gaming preferences and goals when choosing a bonus type. If you enjoy slots, free spins might be more appealing, while deposit bonuses provide flexibility for exploring different games. Familiarize yourself with the most common types: Welcome Bonuses are offered to new players upon signing up and making their first deposit. Welcome bonuses can come in the form of a percentage match bonus on your deposit, free spins on selected slots, or a combination of both. Deposit Bonuses are awarded when you make subsequent deposits after the initial deposit. They often come as a percentage match bonus, meaning the casino matches a percentage of your deposit amount with bonus funds. Free Spins allow you to play specific slot games without using your own funds. Any winnings from free spins may be subject to wagering requirements.

<h2>What to Think About Before Choosing a Bonus</h2>
<p>Before choosing a Bitcoin casino bonus, it&#8217;s suggested to carefully consider some factors to ensure you will be happy with the decision. Here&#8217;s a closer look at what you should think about:</p>
Read the Bitcoin Casino Bonus Terms and Conditions
<p>Thoroughly review the terms and conditions associated with the bonus because this section outlines important details that can impact your gaming experience.</p>
<p>Pay close attention to wagering requirements, which specify the number of times you must wager the bonus amount before being eligible to withdraw any winnings.</p>
<p>Additionally, be aware of restrictions, which may limit the maximum amount you can cash out from bonus winnings. Other limitations, such as casino games restrictions and time limitations, may also be mentioned in the terms and conditions.</p>
Know The Different Casino Bonuses
<p>Bitcoin casinos offer various types of bonuses, each catering to different player preferences and playing styles. Consider your gaming preferences and goals when choosing a bonus type.</p>
<p>If you enjoy slots, free spins might be more appealing, while deposit bonuses provide flexibility for exploring different games. Familiarize yourself with the most common types:</p>
<p>Welcome Bonuses are offered to new players upon signing up and making their first deposit. Welcome bonuses can come in the form of a percentage match bonus on your deposit, free spins on selected slots, or a combination of both.</p>
<p>Deposit Bonuses are awarded when you make subsequent deposits after the initial deposit. They often come as a percentage match bonus, meaning the casino matches a percentage of your deposit amount with bonus funds.</p>
<p>Free Spins allow you to play specific slot games without using your own funds. Any winnings from free spins may be subject to wagering requirements.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Casino Bonuses vs. Traditional Casino Bonuses</h2>
<p>Bitcoin casino bonuses offer several advantages over traditional <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/gambling/best-online-casino-real-money/">online casino real money</a> bonuses. One significant advantage is the speed of transactions. Bitcoin transactions are usually faster and more efficient compared to traditional banking methods, allowing you to claim and use your bonus funds without delay.</p>
<p>Moreover, Bitcoin casino bonuses often come with higher bonus amounts or better percentages than traditional bonuses. This increased value provides a more enticing offer for players.</p>

Choosing The Right Bitcoin Casino Site
<p>When selecting a Bitcoin casino, it&#8217;s essential to prioritize trusted and reviewed platforms. Look for casinos that hold valid licenses and have a solid reputation in the industry.</p>
<p>Research online reviews and ratings to know the trustworthiness of the casino. Additionally, ensure that the casino accepts crypto as a payment method, as this is crucial for accessing Bitcoin deposit bonuses.</p>
Create An Account
<p>Sign up and complete the registration process. Once you have chosen a crypto casino, proceed to create your account. Look for the &#8220;Sign Up&#8221; or &#8220;Register&#8221; button on the website.</p>
<p>You will be prompted to provide some personal information, such as your name, email address, and sometimes your physical address. Fill in the required details accurately and ensure that you use a valid email address as it may be needed for account verification.</p>

<p>Once the bonus funds or free spins are available in your account, you can start browsing the game library. Choose from a wide variety of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/gambling/best-bitcoin-slots-guide/">Bitcoin slots</a>, table games, live dealer games, and more.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Filecoin, a decentralized storage platform based on blockchain technology, has recently found itself entangled in a regulatory debate as the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) raises concerns over its classification as a security.  Grayscale Investments, a prominent digital asset management firm, has been instructed by the SEC to withdraw its application for a Filecoin Trust, citing potential securities implications. Grayscale&#8217;s intent to launch an updated Filecoin Trust product was initially disclosed through a Form 10 application submitted to the SEC on April 14. However, in a recent announcement, Grayscale revealed that the regulatory body has expressed reservations about Filecoin&#8217;s categorization, asserting that it could fall under the definition of a security.

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows the cost basis of the 1-3 months old Bitcoin investors has continued to provide support to the price recently. Bitcoin Has Once Again Bounced Off This Support Line As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, if this line doesn&#8217;t break, then BTC should be able to continue its bullish momentum. The relevant indicator here is the &#8220;realized price,&#8221; which is a metric derived from a Bitcoin capitalization model called the realized cap. The realized cap calculates the total value of the cryptocurrency by assuming that each individual coin in the circulating supply is worth the same as the price at which it was last moved (which is unlike the market cap, which just uses the current spot price for this purpose). When this model is divided by the total number of coins in circulation, the &#8220;realized price&#8221; emerges. The significance of this indicator is that it&#8217;s the price at which the average investor in the market bought their coins. While this realized price is for the entire market, the metric can also be defined for only parts of the sector. In the context of the current discussion, the group of interest is the one with the investors who have been holding their coins since between 1 month and 3 months ago. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Signal: Whales Accumulate 84,897 BTC Here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin realized price for this particular group: The value of the metric seems to have been going up in recent days &#124; Source: CryptoQuant The 1-3 months cohort is part of the &#8220;short-term holder&#8221; (STH) group, which is one of the two main divisions of the Bitcoin market. The STHs include all investors that have been holding onto their coins since less than 155 days ago. As displayed in the above graph, the realized price of the 1-3 months group has been constantly going up recently. This trend naturally makes sense, as the price of the cryptocurrency has also been rising in the same period. Since these BTC investors only acquired their coins within the last 3 months, their cost basis would obviously follow the trend in the asset&#8217;s price, albeit with a bit of lag. Related Reading: Dogecoin, Shiba Inu Whales Move Massive Amounts, Dumping Going On? What&#8217;s interesting, however, is the line&#8217;s interaction with the price. From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price was finding resistance here while the bear market was going on. The likely reason behind this pattern may have been that these investors, who would be in losses for the majority of the time in the bear market, would participate in mass selling whenever the price would touch their average cost basis (that is, their realized price), as it would appear as the ideal exit opportunity in such a period since they would at least be able to avoid losses that way. Since the start of the rally this year, though, the pattern seems to have flipped, as the realized price of the 1-3 months cohort has been providing support to the asset. It would appear that these investors are currently looking at their cost basis as a profitable buying opportunity since they probably believe that the price would go up in the near future. Right now, the realized price of this group is around $26,600, which is the level that Bitcoin bounced off from yesterday. As the line still seems to be holding as support, this segment of the STHs looks to have not lost their bullish conviction yet.
