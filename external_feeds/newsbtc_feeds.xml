					<description><![CDATA[GMX, the perpetual trading decentralized exchange (DEX) allowing up to 50X leverage, now generates more trading fees than the BNB Smart Chain (BSC) and Bitcoin. GMX Is The Third Most Active Platform According to statistics, GMX&#8217;s 1-day fee on January 19 was around $589,000, while BSC and Bitcoin on-chain fees, over the same period, stood at $524,232 and $328,935, respectively.  Ethereum and Uniswap are the only two major protocols more active than the perpetual trading decentralized exchange, per the above data. During this time, the total Gas fees accrued in Ethereum exceeded $5 million. In Uniswap, it was over $2.1 million, roughly 4x GMX&#8217;s and BSC&#8217;s daily fees. Related Reading: Binance USD (BUSD) Exchange Reserves Dry Up, Reason Behind Bitcoin’s Slowdown? GMX supports trading various coins, including BTC, ETH, and AVAX. As of writing, GMX had $96,802,651,673 in total trading volume with open interest, that is, the number of opened positions, long and short, of $207,102,720. Meanwhile, over 208,000 active traders were using the platform to trade on Arbitrum and Avalanche. GMX launched on Arbitrum and Avalanche, considering their scalability and low fees versus Ethereum. Arbitrum is Ethereum&#8217;s layer-2 platform permitting scalable and low-fee trading fees. On the other hand, Avalanche is scalable and boasts the fastest settlement time in crypto. By launching on these two platforms, GMX says it allows users to save on costs by entering and exiting positions with minimal spread and zero price impact.  Traders take the profits of selling positions in USDC and the quote token when they go long. GMX prices are based on Chainlink&#8217;s decentralized oracles to prevent price manipulations.   Trading Fees As A Measure Of Activity Trading fees generated by a dApp or on a blockchain are a crucial activity indicator. Despite the tendency of users to opt for protocols offering near-zero fees, the decentralized nature of blockchains means validators or entities securing core infrastructures must be compensated.  In decentralized finance dApps like Uniswap and GMX, trading fees generated from swapping activities are distributed to liquidity providers (LPs). There are also governance tokens that are distributed. Anyone can be an LP. Related Reading: How Uniswap Was Saved From Critical Vulnerability By This Security Firm In September 2020, Uniswap distributed UNI to users who had, in one way or another, used the protocol to swap tokens before the airdrop distributing date. Currently, UNI trades at $6.1. Interestingly for GMX, the 1-day trading fee of $589,000 posted on January 19 exceeds the total average amount accrued over the past trading week of $565,682. The same trend can be observed in the top-5 most active platforms. Making extensions on this could point to renewed interest from users and traders using the protocol in one way or another. In GMX, it could mean more traders are posting traders, aiming to clip the market and turn in a profit. Coincidentally, the upswing in trading fees is recorded when the cryptocurrency market appears to be bottoming up after losses. At least, this was the trend in 2022.  Featured image from GMX, charts from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Anthony Scaramucci, the founder of Skybridge Capital, thinks failed crypto exchange FTX cannot be saved following its bankruptcy filing.  Ex-FTX Boss&#8217; Betrayal In an exclusive interview while attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the founder and American entrepreneur opined that there is no way the exchange could be saved.  Still, Scaramucci considers the founder of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, a friend who was given a seat at the table of “high-profile people.” The problem is he feels betrayed that Sam turned out to be “delusional” and allegedly a fraud. Whether Sam will end up in jail or not, he adds, is up to the jury and the presiding judge. FTX, at its peak, was among one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, offering what was, at that time, thought to be a solid trading platform for hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of users.  Related Reading: 59% of Bitcoin Holders Are Sitting On Profits However, as the crypto market cratered and Bitcoin slid toward this week&#8217;s trade range of around $20k, cracks began to emerge in FTX. &#160; Eventually, an explosive piece revealing the misdoings of its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, and several accounting errors in their finances broke the camel’s back. FTX halted customer withdrawals before news broke out that they were filing for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy protection in the United States. It later emerged that FTX and its trading wing, Alameda Research, had misappropriated billions of customer funds. Anthony Scaramucci: Skybridge Capital Is Patient Considering the evidence presented and claims from the restructuring officer in charge of FTX bankruptcy proceedings, Anthony Scaramucci said nothing is to be done. He divulged that his fund wasn&#8217;t spared by the crypto winter and the FTX contagion as market prices slumped, affecting their revenue. Their core fund, Anthony said, was down 30 percent in 2022. In January 2023, there were signs of recovery, and their core funds are up double digits. Scaramucci also confirmed that Skybridge Capital is “completed unleveraged” and owns its inventory.  Asked whether he lost money last year, he confirmed that his Bitcoin (BTC) is intact and didn’t lose any monies since he didn’t use leverage. Leverage is a trader borrows money to trade. The borrowed funds, together with the deposit, act as a margin allowing for higher profits. Still, there can be losses if a trader’s an incorrect prognosis. Traders can lose all their deposits if they use leverage and trade any other asset, including crypto.  Anthony revealed that though FTX finds itself in crisis and could dissolve, the exchange was one of the early investors of Skybridge Capital, buying 30% of the fund. As part of the deal, the fund bought 10 percent of FTX’s FTT token only to sell it for a loss of $9.5 million.  Related Reading: FTX’s FTT Token Spikes 43%, A Revival In The Works? Despite this, Antony said they are patient and waiting for “what the bankruptcy people say” so that they can buy back their shares. The fund, he explains, isn’t going to blame the disgraced founder of FTX for all woes in the crypto market or Skybridge Capital. Overall, he remains confident in crypto&#8217;s prospects.

					<description><![CDATA[Dogecoin started losing value as soon as it fell outside its ascending parallel channel. At the moment, Dogecoin is trading laterally. Over the last 24 hours, DOGE went up by 0.3%, which confirms that the coin was stuck in a consolidated price region. Last week, Dogecoin brought in close to 4% gains. The technical outlook for the Dogecoin price depicted that bearish momentum had set in. Demand and accumulation for the meme-coin depreciated when it started to trade sideways. Related Reading: Tezos Approaches The ‘Mumbai Upgrade’, What’s Next For XTZ? The meme coin noted a price pullback after it breached the $0.88 resistance level. Over the last few days, Dogecoin has witnessed a substantial influx of buyers; however, selling pressure has amplified at press time. Overall, the meme coin has a bullish structure as it has managed to keep its price above the 200-Simple Moving Average line. In the shorter time frame, Dogecoin might retrace close to the $0.74 level before recovering or falling in value further. The market capitalization of DOGE declined slightly, indicating that selling pressure has mounted on the chart. Dogecoin Price Analysis: One-Day Chart DOGE was trading at $0.81 at the time of writing. The coin corrected itself after it reached the $0.88 price level. Immediate resistance for the meme coin stood at $0.87, close to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level. Moving past the $0.87 mark can push DOGE to the $0.104 resistance mark. On the other hand, if Dogecoin fails to stay above the $0.74 support level, it can fall to $0.66. If demand picks up slightly, it is unlikely that Dogecoin will fall below the $0.74 price floor. The amount of Dogecoin traded in the last session decreased, indicating that there has been a fall in buying pressure. Technical Analysis The meme coin has depicted a fall in demand as buyers started to decline on the daily chart. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) retraced after it stood close to the 70-mark, signifying excess buyers over sellers. This signified that the meme coin was correcting itself at press time. The RSI, however, remained above the 50-mark, indicating that buying strength was greater than selling strength. Dogecoin price was above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA), indicating that buyers were in control of price momentum in the market. It was also above the 50-SMA (yellow) and 200-SMA (green) lines, indicating bullishness. The coin, however, formed a death cross where the 200-SMA line crossed over the 20-SMA line. A death cross is accompanied by a significant fall in value. The meme-coin continued to display buy signals on the one-day chart. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence, which indicates price momentum and trend reversal, depicted green signal bars tied to buy signals. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Hold The Line At $20,700, But Bigger Losses Are Imminent? These green histograms were shrinking, indicating that it was probably not a good time to buy the asset. In resonance with the same, the Bollinger Bands that suggest volatility widened apart, implying that the price would significantly change over the next trading session.

<p>The meme coin has depicted a fall in demand as buyers started to decline on the daily chart. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) retraced after it stood close to the 70-mark, signifying excess buyers over sellers. This signified that the meme coin was correcting itself at press time.</p>
<p>The RSI, however, remained above the 50-mark, indicating that buying strength was greater than selling strength. Dogecoin price was above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA), indicating that buyers were in control of price momentum in the market.</p>
<p>It was also above the 50-SMA (yellow) and 200-SMA (green) lines, indicating bullishness. The coin, however, formed a death cross where the 200-SMA line crossed over the 20-SMA line. A death cross is accompanied by a significant fall in value.</p>

<p>The meme-coin continued to display buy signals on the one-day chart. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence, which indicates price momentum and trend reversal, depicted green signal bars tied to buy signals.</p>

<p>These green histograms were shrinking, indicating that it was probably not a good time to buy the asset. In resonance with the same, the Bollinger Bands that suggest volatility widened apart, implying that the price would significantly change over the next trading session.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows the Binance USD (BUSD) exchange reserves have declined recently, a factor that may be behind Bitcoin&#8217;s slowdown. Binance USD (BUSD) Exchange Reserves Have Gone Down As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, there was a very large inflow of $250 million BUSD just a while ago. The &#8220;exchange reserve&#8221; is an indicator that measures the total amount of a cryptocurrency (which, in the present case, is Binance USD) currently being stored on wallets of centralized exchanges. Generally, investors swap their coins for stablecoins like BUSD when they want to avoid the volatility associated with other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. When these holders feel that prices are right to reenter the volatile markets, they shift their stables back into their desired coins. This can act as buying pressure for the specific crypto that they are swapping into. Investors usually make use of exchanges to swap these coins, which means that whenever the exchange reserve of a stablecoin like BUSD rises, it presents the possibility that holders want to buy back into volatile cryptocurrencies. A large enough increase in the stablecoin reserve can result in a high amount of buying pressure for other coins, and can therefore have a bullish effect on their prices.

Since then, however, the metric has been steadily declining and has hit significantly lower values now. But from the chart, it&#8217;s apparent that while the BUSD reserve was coming down from high values, Bitcoin had been rallying instead. This means that holders might have been actively swapping the stablecoin for BTC, thus providing a boost to its price. The graph also displays data for a metric called the &#8220;exchange netflow,&#8221; which tells us the net number of coins entering or exiting exchange wallets. When this metric has a positive value, it means investors are depositing a net amount of the asset to exchanges currently, while negative values suggest net withdrawals are taking place. A while ago, there was a huge positive spike in the Binance USD exchange netflow of around $250 million (which is what caused the reserve to blow up). This inflow may have been what helped the recent BTC rally.

					<description><![CDATA[The last two weeks have been incredible for the price of bitcoin. The digital asset has been able to successfully make its way out of a depressing bear trend and reached two-month highs in the process. However, with the recent pullback, there may be a bit more pain for bitcoin investors before the upward rally continues. Analyst Justin Bennett Says Bitcoin Below $20,000 Is Possible In a new issue of his crypto trading newsletter, analyst Justin Bennett reveals some bearish tendencies of the market. He first points to the fact that the market has enjoyed a good amount of gains, adding as much as 28% to its value in just the last 18 days. But as is expected after such a rally, a market correction has pulled back the price of the digital asset. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price: Investors Predict 12% Decline For BTC In Next Two Weeks While there have been speculations that this pullback would only be temporary, Bennett explains that it could go a lot further. Now, the analyst does not take away from the bull trend that bitcoin is currently on but rather presents a scenario where the price of the cryptocurrency could back to below $20,000 before the rally resumes. BTC could see sub-$20,000 before rally resumes &#124; Source: Cryptocademy BTC has already fallen back into the $20,000 region as of the time of this writing, giving credence to Bennett’s analysis. However, with key support for the digital asset now resting at $20,000, bears could pull the price as close to this support as possible before the bears take over once more. “I like Bitcoin higher toward $25,000 and potentially $29,000, but not without a pullback into the $20,000 region first,” Bennett said in his newsletter. Factors That Drive This Pullback In the same newsletter, Bennett points to the PPI data release that underwhelmed the market. In the end, the much-anticipated release was lower than expected, triggering fatigue in the market. Bitcoin had fallen below $21,000 as a result of this. Also pointing to the US Dollar Index (DXY), the analyst explained the movement of this index on the back of the PPI data release would’ve been bullish for assets such as BTC. “But I think markets got ahead of themselves, so a lot of that bullishness was already priced in,” Bennett added. BTC corrects downward following rally &#124; Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com Since this pullback has pushed the price of BTC dangerously close to the 5-day moving average, it should come as no surprise if the cryptocurrency were to lose another couple of hundred dollars off its value in the coming days. Related Reading: Bitcoin On Exchanges Drop By 44%, Could This Fuel More BTC Rally? However, the bullish trend is expected to continue shortly as trading volume remains high, and investor sentiment reaching 9-month highs, sitting very close to greed on the Crypto Fear &#38; Greed Index. BTC is trading at $20,779 at the time of this writing. Its price is down 2.18% in the last 24 hours, but up 14.54% in a 7-day period.

					<description><![CDATA[Based on the year-to-date performance and their drawdown from their all-time highs (ATHs), Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have performed very similarly. While BTC has risen by 25.5% since the beginning of the year, ETH has climbed by about 27%. From its ATH, Bitcoin has declined by 69.9%, while Ether is down by 68.9%. Despite this very comparable performance, the debate persists that Ethereum may replace (&#8220;flip&#8221;) Bitcoin as the largest cryptocurrency by market cap within the next few years or in the next bull cycle. One supporter of this theory is Dragonfly Capital&#8217;s Haseeb Qureshi. In a recent interview, the investment firm&#8217;s managing partner said that if any cryptocurrency is ever going to reach $1 trillion, it will be Ethereum. His reasoning? Institutional investors who need to align buying with their Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) agenda: You need institutional buyers to be willing to buy this thing in size and Ethereum is really the only game in town if you are an institutional buyer. Furthermore, the expert expressed that it is becoming increasingly difficult for institutions to justify Bitcoin as an investment. &#8220;I see it a lot because we work a lot with big institutions [&#8230;]. It&#8217;s explicitly something that gets more and more of a concern for them. They want to invest in crypto, but it has to be compliant with their ESG mandate,&#8221; Qureshi said. 2. Ethereum is superior to #Bitcoin in the eyes of institutions, as it&#8217;s more ESG friendly. &#8220;If you want a trillion dollar coin, you&#8217;re not going to get there off the back of retail.&#8221; &#8220;Ethereum is really the only game in town if you want institutional buyers.&#8221; pic.twitter.com/f2H2gg224T — Miles Deutscher (@milesdeutscher) January 18, 2023 Another argument made by proponents of the theory is also that Ethereum is predominantly OFAC (US Office of Foreign Assets Control) compliant, which could make it easier for institutions to enter the market. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Price Fall If Genesis Files For Bankruptcy? Here’s What We Know On the other hand, Bitcoin supporters are likely to counter that the mining industry is one of the most sustainable industries of all. In its latest report, the Bitcoin Mining Council found that the energy mix in Bitcoin mining is now 58.9% sustainable. Furthermore, estimates suggest that Bitcoin mining can reduce global emissions by up to 8% by 2030, simply by converting the world&#8217;s wasted and dangerous methane emissions into emissions that are 80 times less harmful. Here&#8217;s What Ethereum / Bitcoin Technical Analysis Says A look at the Ethereum / Bitcoin 4-hour chart shows that ETH currently remains in a downtrend compared to BTC. ETH saw a spike above and out of the pennant for the ETH/BTC ratio, followed by a retrace back to support as Bitcoin broke out from $18,000 to $21,000 in a matter of days, as explained by the founder of LedgArt via Twitter. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Dips From $1,600 But ETH Could Start A Fresh Rally According to the analyst, these types of fake-out wicks are breaking out to the downside. He argued: &#8220;Still expecting this level to break lower over the next several weeks as BTC continues to strengthen, absorbing liquidity from alts similar to what happened in the 2019 bear market rally,&#8221; and shared the chart below. BTC is currently changing hands at $18,798, while ETH is sitting just above the $1,500 support level at $1,528.

<p>Another argument made by proponents of the theory is also that Ethereum is predominantly OFAC (US Office of Foreign Assets Control) compliant, which could make it easier for institutions to enter the market.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Bitcoin supporters are likely to counter that the mining industry is one of the most sustainable industries of all. In its latest report, the Bitcoin Mining Council found that the energy mix in Bitcoin mining is now 58.9% sustainable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, estimates <a href="https://twitter.com/DSBatten/status/1519902364819685376" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">suggest</a> that Bitcoin mining can reduce global emissions by up to 8% by 2030, simply by converting the world&#8217;s wasted and dangerous methane emissions into emissions that are 80 times less harmful.</p>
<h2>Here&#8217;s What Ethereum / Bitcoin Technical Analysis Says</h2>
<p>A look at the Ethereum / Bitcoin 4-hour chart shows that ETH currently remains in a downtrend compared to BTC. ETH saw a spike above and out of the pennant for the ETH/BTC ratio, followed by a retrace back to support as Bitcoin broke out from $18,000 to $21,000 in a matter of days, as <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoKaleo/status/1615961654683893760" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">explained</a> by the founder of LedgArt via Twitter.</p>

<p>According to the analyst, these types of fake-out wicks are breaking out to the downside. He argued: &#8220;Still expecting this level to break lower over the next several weeks as BTC continues to strengthen, absorbing liquidity from alts similar to what happened in the 2019 bear market rally,&#8221; and shared the chart below.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Tezos (XTZ) network is readying itself for its latest upgrade, called the &#8216;Mumbai Upgrade.&#8217; On January 17, Nomadic Labs, which is a blockchain developer within the Tezos community, mentioned the Tezos protocol proposal, Mumbai, which is headed toward the implementation process. This will be the 13th upgrade made to the Tezos network. This upgrade will implement various new features. The main features include transfer tickets between accounts and a much shorter block time of 15 seconds. Related Reading: Solana Gleams 30% In Last 7 Days As SOL Bulls Try To Break $21 Barrier Further, this upgrade will add Epoxy, a new technology on Mainnet, which is precisely a validity rollup that can also be referred to as a new layer 2 scaling solution. The Mainnet will gain further strength due to Epoxy, which introduces SNARKs&#8217; proof-of-validity, which will be the reason for quicker transactions. This 13th upgrade, which is called the &#8216;Mumbai Upgrade&#8217; will be implemented after a number of tests are carried out. However, once implemented, the system will get closer to Tezos&#8217; target of achieving one million transactions per second, according to the Nomadic Lab&#8217;s report. The implementation of the upgrade will, as a consequence, increase the value of Tezos&#8217; native token XTZ. The price of the altcoin, XTZ, has reacted positively to this development. XTZ experienced a price reversal, but the altcoin has since resumed its bullish momentum. Tezos Price Analysis: One-Day Chart XTZ was trading at $0.99 at the time of writing. Although the coin started to retrace over the 48 hours, it has regained bullish momentum on the chart. The altcoin has formed a prominent cup-and-handle trading pattern, which is an extension of bullish momentum. This change in price momentum can be attributed to the announcement of the &#8216;Mumbai Upgrade&#8217;. Immediate resistance to XTZ stands at $1.02, but the coin is expected to retrace to $0.97. Once it reaches the $0.97 mark, Tezos can target $1.19, which will mean an 18% appreciation. Over the last week, the coin managed to surge over 8%. The amount of XTZ traded in the last session increased, signifying an increased amount of buying. Technical Analysis XTZ had secured a multi-month high with regard to the buying pressure it witnessed. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) touched the 80 mark a few trading sessions ago, signifying an overvalued tendency. Often, a coin that is overbought experiences a price correction and a fall in demand; Tezos also displayed the same, but at press time, the RSI again noted an uptick. This uptick could mean that the altcoin might head back close to the 80-mark. This unusual uptick can be because of the newest development. On the same note, XTZ rose above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA), which indicated that buyers were driving the price momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Drops To $20,700 As Miner Outflows Surge The coin was above the 50-SMA (yellow) line too. So with increased accumulation, XTZ can soon breach the 200-SMA (green) line. Overall, Tezos remains quite optimistic on the chart; however, the coin has to remain above its local support line of $0.97 for the uptrend to continue.

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin lost steam the previous day and seems poised to re-test its support levels in the coming days. The cryptocurrency rallied on the back of favorable macroeconomic winds and high upside liquidity from overleveraged short traders.  Related Reading: Solana Gleams 30% In Last 7 Days As SOL Bulls Try To Break $21 Barrier As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $20,800 with a 3% loss in the last 24 hours. BTC remained positive during the previous seven days and recorded a 16% profit. The number one crypto by market capitalization is the best performer in the top 10.  The Biggest Obstacle For Bitcoin In The Short Term NewsBTC reported that short positions were piling up as Bitcoin trended to the upside. The market took out over half a billion dollars in short positions. As the market trended upside, these positions were liquidated, allowing BTC to continue climbing.  In that sense, Bitcoin might keep trending upwards but at a slower pace. As the market ate off those shorts during the past week, over-confident long positions might become the target. This shift might push BTC back to the critical supports at $19,600 to $19,700.  These levels have confluence with the 200-Day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and 50x leverage longs. Thus, there is a high liquidity pool sitting at those levels, ready to be taken by market movers.  On higher timeframes, a recent report from QCP Capital claims the macroeconomic winds might change and could negatively impact crypto. 2023 kicked off with a positive outlook on critical metrics, such as inflation, and high expectations of a monetary pivot by the U.S. Federal Reserve. The financial institution has been hiking interest rates and unloading its balance sheet to combat inflation. This metric has been at its highest level in the last 40 decades.  Markets Will Take A &#8220;Rude Shock?&#8221; Recent data shows inflation is declining; this trend might support the Fed’s slowdown on its monetary policy and provide room for Bitcoin and risk on assets to rally. However, QCP Capital believes that while Q1, 2023 might be positive for these assets, Q2 could see some hurdles:  While we expect the 1 February FOMC to push back strongly against this pricing, we believe the 22 March FOMC will be the moment of truth, when updated rate forecasts will be released. Should there be no adjustment to the median 2023 dot, then we expect markets will be in for a rude shock. The fact that Bitcoin and some stocks have been rallying is evidence of “how quickly financial conditions have loosened,” the firm believes. The Fed has been fighting against this economic environment, so its return could push the financial institution to tighten its monetary policy.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Drops To $20,700 As Miner Outflows Surge For this time next year, the market is expecting much lower interest rates, as seen in the chart above. It remains to be seen if the Fed will indulge these expectations or if inflation will persist, leading to more pain across the crypto and the legacy financial market.]]></description>
