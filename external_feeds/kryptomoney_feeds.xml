<p>Bank of France Governor François Villeroy de Galhau wants to strengthen the country&#8217;s grip on crypto firms this year ahead of EU-wide regulation set to take effect in 2024.<br /><br />Villeroy made the following <a href="https://www.banque-france.fr/en/intervention/new-year-wishes-2023">statement</a> during a speech on Thursday:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The disruption seen in 2022 is nourishing one basic conviction: France should switch as soon as possible to the compulsory authorization of DASPs (digital asset service providers) rather than simply requiring their registration,”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The French financial regulator, Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF), now <a href="https://www.amf-france.org/en/professionals/fintech/my-relations-amf/obtain-dasp-authorisation">offers</a> registration and optional licensing to crypto firms wanting to lawfully deliver services. The coming year may see the implementation of mandatory licensing requirements for crypto asset service providers.<br /><br />The crypto giant <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/binance-appoints-uk-director-mentions-need-to-uphold-regulations/">Binance,</a> as well as Société Générale, one of France&#8217;s largest banks, were granted the French license earlier this year.<br /><br />Regulators from around the world have become concerned as a result of a string of crypto sector collapses and market declines over the past year.</p>
<p>Policymakers encouraged hastened adoption of the EU-wide Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation following the most recent collapse of crypto exchange titan <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-transferred-assets-to-bahamas-government-after-bankruptcy/">FTX</a>. The financial regulators who will be writing the implementation laws in the upcoming year retorted that they are already under time constraints.<br /><br />The MiCA regulatory framework lays out detailed licensing requirements for cryptocurrency businesses. Many policy experts believe that had MiCA previously been in place, the impact of the FTX collapse on Europeans may have been lessened.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The price of Tron (TRX), the 15th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, fell on Friday as the overall cryptocurrency market remained stable due to issues related to the cryptocurrency exchange, Huobi.<br /><br />Justin Sun, the founder of Tron, is a member of Huobi&#8217;s advisory board. The exchange announced Friday that it would reduce its staff by 20% and mandate that workers receive their pay in stablecoins. To put an end to a mutiny, it also cut down internal staff communications channels, according to sources on Twitter.<br /><br />Before the price of TRX began to change, it decreased by almost 8%. TRX is currently trading at $0.053, a decrease of 1.53% over the previous day. As traders rushed into the current volatility to make profits, TRX trading volume also increased by 314% in the past 24 hours.<br /><br />The USDD stablecoin, which is developed on Tron, lost its intended peg to the US dollar by 3 cents. The USDD stablecoin exchange rate at the time of writing was $0.97. According to DefiLlama data, this price movement led to a 2% decrease in the value locked on Tron-based decentralized applications.</p>
<h2>Justin Sun Moves $100 Million of Crypto To Support Huobi</h2>
<p>TRON founder and crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun transferred around $100 million worth of stablecoins to cryptocurrency exchange Huobi Global, which has been hammered by a wave of withdrawals, according to a report by Bloomberg.<br /><br />On Friday, an Ethereum wallet linked to Sun withdrew $50 million of USDT and $50 million of USDC from the Binance exchange and moved the tokens to Huobi around three hours later, according to blockchain research firm Nansen. “It just shows the confidence in Huobi Exchange,” Sun said of the move in a Telegram message. “It’s just my personal funds.”<br /><br />The transactions took place amid increased pressure on Singapore-based Huobi, which, according to statistics from Coinglass, had nearly $85 million in cryptocurrency outflows in 24 hours. The exchange announced on Friday that it would now operate with a &#8220;very lean team&#8221; as the crypto market downturn entered its second year.<br /><br />According to a November Bloomberg News report, Sun invested nearly $1 billion to acquire a roughly 60% stake in Huobi. Moving stablecoins to Huobi &#8220;could be to help with the higher withdrawals or preserve a level of confidence in the exchange,&#8221; Lee, a Nansen data journalist, suggested in a tweet on Friday.<br /><br />Another development is the closure of the wealth management section by cryptocurrency behemoth Digital Currency Group, the latest indication of difficulties amid a severe and protracted downturn in the cryptocurrency market. <br /><br />The Stamford, Connecticut-based company, which also owns brokerage Genesis and asset management firm Grayscale Investments, is coping with some problems after letting go of 10% of its workforce at the end of the previous year. Additionally, Genesis cut more than 60 roles or 30% of its workforce.<br /><br />After the abrupt failure of FTX, one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, around the end of 2022, the business led by Barry Silbert is coping with changes and difficulties among some of its main subsidiaries.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/avax-price-analysis-avalanche-is-trading-up-in-a-sea-of-red-enters-top-10-as-vaneck-avax-etn-launches/">Avalanche (AVAX)</a> is currently down 1.51% in the last 24 hours at $11.67. Shopify merchants can now mint and sell NFTs through a no-code interface thanks to Venly&#8217;s Avalanche app. Avalanche support has been expanded by Venly, a blockchain technology startup, via its Shopify NFT minting app today. Before recently, only a small number of Shopify users had access to the layer-1 blockchain platform, which is touted as a quicker and less expensive substitute for the leading NFT platform Ethereum. According to the firm, Shopify is a major eCommerce platform that supports the online shops of millions of retailers worldwide. In late 2021, Venly made their Shopify NFT minting tool available on Polygon, the Ethereum scaling network. The second network to be supported is Avalanche. In response to the anticipated rise of Web3 gaming on the platform, the leading NFT marketplace, OpenSea, extended support for Avalanche NFTs in October.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $17.50, $14.50, $12.50<br />Support Levels: $11.35, $10.50, $8.50</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/avax-price-analysis-avax-tackles-barrier-japanese-media-giant-gree-to-build-web3-games-run-nodes-on-avalanche/">AVAX/USD</a> remains in extended sideways mode, hovering around the daily moving average (MA 50) at $12.0, with the psychological $10.50 level providing good support and holding the action for the third week in a row. <br /><br />On the daily chart, technicals are mixed, as momentum continues to be negative, while the relative strength index (RSI) is rising and the moving averages are neutral. The action is supported by growing optimism for a rebound, but it lacks the momentum to break higher.</p>

<p>The Avalanche (AVAX) bounced over concerns that the USD might shift away from its strong stance. The pair bounced off a 4-hour MA 50 and low of $11.34, resulting in a vertical rise above the level of $11.50, which prompted some sellers to close their positions. <br /><br />At the moment, the short-term RSI has returned from the overbought situation, resulting in a temporary pause in the rally as buyers became wary of chasing higher bids. More short-covering could ensue if AVAX stays above $11.00, fuelling the recovery. Then the 4-hour moving average (MA 200) at $12.40 would be the next stop.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The former CEO of the now-defunct cryptocurrency lender<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/celsius-now-directed-to-refund-44-million-to-users/"> Celsius</a>, Alex Mashinsky, is accused of defrauding investors in a case brought up by the attorney general of New York.<br /><br />According to the complaint filed today,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The collapse of Celsius left many individuals in a state of desperation and financial ruin,&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Celsius’s business model was unsustainable. As Celsius proved unable to generate sufficient returns through safe loans and investments, it began to make uncollateralized loans to institutional borrowers and engage in risky strategies on unregulated decentralized finance protocols.&#8221; <br /><br />“As the former CEO of Celsius, Alex Mashinsky promised to lead investors to financial freedom but led them down a path of financial ruin,” <span style="color: #333333">said </span><span style="color: #333333">Attorney General Letitia James in a statement.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the civil suit, James and her staff claim that Mashinsky misled investors by claiming that Celsius had $11 billion under management while failing to disclose that the company also had $11.9 billion in liabilities.<br /><br />The civil lawsuit would prevent Mashinsky from running any firm in the state of New York and compel him to pay damages and return investor funds.<br /><br />A judge ruled on Wednesday that digital assets stored in Celsius accounts by customers were considered the company&#8217;s property due to the terms of service. Celsius is also embroiled in a lengthy bankruptcy process in federal bankruptcy court.<br /><br />While promoting its cryptocurrency deposits as being similar to bank accounts, Celsius gave its users substantial interest rates on their holdings. However, such accounts lacked insurance, and the company went down during the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ftx-stablecoin-ftt-reserves-fell-after-binance-threaten-to-sell-token/">stablecoin</a> fall last year. Users are currently rushing to release funds embroiled in legal actions.</p>

<p>The founders of <a href="https://twitter.com/3ACLiq/status/1611018579532742657">Three Arrows Capital,</a> a failing cryptocurrency hedge fund, were recently served with a subpoena by the Southern District of New York United States Bankruptcy Court. The founders, Kyle Davies and Su Zhu are the targets of the subpoena, which was delivered by liquidators via the well-known social media site Twitter.<br /><br />They have been ordered to allow an inspection of the premises at a specified date and time and to produce all papers in their possession (regardless of whether they are held by them directly or by a third party).</p>
<p>In July, Three Arrows Capital filed for bankruptcy, leaving many investors with no money.<br /><br />The collapse of Three Arrows Capital continues to have an impact on the markets for digital assets. <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/genesis-ceo-asks-for-more-time-to-address-lending-issues/">Genesis</a> Global Trading&#8217;s parent company, Digital Currency Group, sued them for $1.2 billion after its subsidiary&#8217;s lending division was compelled to halt new loan originations and redemptions in November. <br /><br />Even though the controversial founders are still active on Twitter, nobody knows where they are. The founders of 3AC were not willing to help, according to a spokeswoman for Teneo Consulting Group, which is in charge of overseeing the bankruptcy processes for 3AC.</p>

<ul>
<li>ETC was trading at $18.66 at the time of publication</li>
<li>ETC trading volume has increased significantly</li>
<li>The ETC collaboration says it is changing the RPC URL for the Ethereum Classic mainnet from Ethercluster to Rivet</li>
</ul>
<p>As its price increased from its low of $15.64 on December 3, ETC, the native asset of the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/etc-price-analysis-ethereum-classic-primed-for-60-rally-in-september-top-mining-pool-announces-support/">Ethereum Classic</a> chain, unexpectedly printed a gigantic green daily candlestick. The daily high of $19.96 was reached on January 4 thanks to the kick, which appeared to break a barrier. ETC was trading at $18.66 at the time of publication, up 21% over the previous 24 hours. Likewise, the Ethereum spinoff has increased by 27% over the previous week. Ethereum Classic, according to blockchain analytics company Sentiment, is experiencing a decent bounce of its own. The statement continued,<em> &#8220;Not only is volume large, but it is also heavily shorted by traders on exchanges.&#8221;</em> Data from <em><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum-classic/">CoinMarketCap</a></em> shows that in the past day, ETC trading volume has increased significantly. In other news, the ETC collaboration says it is changing the RPC URL for the Ethereum Classic mainnet from Ethercluster to Rivet. The Ethercluster RPC endpoints will be discontinued on July 1, 2023, a notice in a blog post reads.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $30.00, $25.00, $20.00<br />Support Levels: $17.00, $15.00, $13.00</p>
<h4>ETC/USD Daily Chart: Ranging</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1488" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63815 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETCUSD-Daily-Jan-5.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETCUSD-Daily-Jan-5.png 1488w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETCUSD-Daily-Jan-5-300x139.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETCUSD-Daily-Jan-5-1024x473.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETCUSD-Daily-Jan-5-768x355.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETCUSD-Daily-Jan-5-750x347.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETCUSD-Daily-Jan-5-1140x527.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1488px) 100vw, 1488px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">ETC/USD Daily Chart</span></em></h6>
<p>The bias is turning positive over long and medium terms, and if the breached daily moving average (MA 50) at $18.00 holds as support, a rally toward $25.00 is anticipated. On the other hand, a break and closing below the daily moving average (MA 200) at $25.00 would refocus attention on the $20.00 level. This week, the pair has recovered and might go higher.<br /><br />On the other hand, given the strength of the USD, we might expect further losses below $25.00, with targets not below $20.00. Technically speaking, a breakout south may occur throughout the course of the upcoming trading days. In this case, the $15.00 level can provide support for the ETC/USD pair.</p>
<h4>ETC/USD 4-Hour Chart: Ranging</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1488" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63816 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETCUSD-4-Hour-Jan-5.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETCUSD-4-Hour-Jan-5.png 1488w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETCUSD-4-Hour-Jan-5-300x139.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETCUSD-4-Hour-Jan-5-1024x473.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETCUSD-4-Hour-Jan-5-768x355.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETCUSD-4-Hour-Jan-5-750x347.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETCUSD-4-Hour-Jan-5-1140x527.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1488px) 100vw, 1488px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">ETC/USD 4-Hour Chart</span></em></h6>
<p>From a technical perspective, the recent breakout toward $20.00 is anticipated to continue during the upcoming trading sessions. In this instance, in the event of a continuous retracement, the horizontal support level of $18.00 might offer support to the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/etc-price-analysis-buyers-push-ethereum-classic-higher-by-14-as-date-for-eths-proof-of-stake-transition-is-unveiled/">ETC/USD pair</a>. The relative strength index (RSI) remains overbought.<br /><br />The initial level of support for the pair is predicted to be $17.00; however, a further breach lower might result in a fall-through that would take it to the next support level of $15.00. The pair is anticipated to encounter its first level of resistance around $20.00, with a subsequent spike pushing it to $25.00.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Cryptocurrencies rebounded strongly on Wednesday, with altcoins leading the market-wide rally. Since its release on December 25, the Shiba Inu-themed coin BONK has returned 3700% to investors, with a 215% increase just in the last day. <br /><br />Airdropping the token to Solana NFT (non-fungible token) communities and creators quickly generated interest in it and increased trading volumes. Data from Coinmarketcap shows that in the past day, BONK&#8217;s trade volume has increased by around 1900%.<br /><br />In the meantime, the demand for SOL tokens has probably been influenced by the viral buzz. The Solana network&#8217;s native coin SOL has gained 16% over the past day, recouping losses from a sharp dip last week. <br /><br />Alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) such as Ethereum Classic, NEAR, and Lido DAO led the way higher, all up over 20% over the past 24 hours. While alternative cryptocurrencies saw prices spike higher on Wednesday, a few altcoin tokens stood out. One such is XYO is up 43% in the last 24 hours and has delivered gains of 170% to traders since the past week. <br /><br />The rally in altcoins, which typically outperform bitcoin in a rising market, suggests an increased appetite for risk among traders.<br /><br />Onchain analytics firm, Santiment notes that Altcoin has heated up with Ethereum trading at a 3-week high as whales’ interest return, ‘’As altcoins have heated up, Ethereum quietly rebounded back above $1,260 for the 1st time in 3 weeks. Though not quite at the level of the big whale dip buys on December 16th (ETH&#8217;s local price bottom), whales are showing increased interest again’’.<br /><br />The rise in most altcoins according to Santiment might have been buoyed by a ‘’short squeeze’’, as most traders aggressively shorted altcoins.<br /><br />Santiment tweeted earlier in the week,’’ Traders are aggressively shorting altcoins today, and some assets could be primed for short liquidations. Based on extreme bets being placed on prices going down, DGB, HBAR, HT, KAVA, KSM, SOL, &amp; ZEC would be candidates for small breakouts if altcoins get any momentum&#8221;.</p>
<h2>Bullish January?</h2>
<p>Likewise, Traders are putting out bullish trades before the next FED meeting fear starts kicking in towards the end of January. The Fed&#8217;s next meeting comes up on Jan 31-February 1. Market speculators might take bullish trades for several reasons at the beginning of January 2023. <br /><br />According to the onchain analytics firm, The market has been stuck in a range for 51 days. However, a breakout looks likely with the US stock market positioned to move upward. <br /><br />Additionally, the VIX chart indicates volatility may start picking up again soon. Furthermore, the DXY chart looks like it&#8217;s ready to take another leg down.<br /><br />If the US stock market benefits from a relief rally at the beginning of January, it might boost crypto traders&#8217; sentiment. Moreover, we might see a slight rally while the BTC Dominance chart pulls back, allowing large-cap altcoins to breathe.<br /><br />However, despite the rally on Wednesday, the mood in the crypto market remained cautious. The Crypto Fear and Greed index, a gauge of market sentiment based on several metrics, was at 29 and reflecting &#8221; fear&#8221;.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom&#8217;s National Crime Agency (NCA) is <a href="https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/crypto-crime-uk-nca-job-anti-money-laundering-national-crime-agency-digital-fraud-20230104">developing</a> a unit that will be in charge of dealing with crypto-crime issues. This group of officials will largely look into dubious financial activities.<br /><br />According to a job posting on the government&#8217;s website, a crypto cell should be established that <em>“will be dedicated to a proactive cryptocurrency remit with the right tools and capabilities to target UK-based subjects.”</em><br /><br />The formation of a <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/cryptocurrency-crimes-costed-south-korea-2-28b-since-july-2017/">crypto crime</a> unit follows the loss of $3 billion in cryptocurrency in the UK due to hacks and frauds. It is not surprising that the $3 billion in hacking losses had a big effect on the UK financial sector.<br /><br />After conducting an investigation, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) discovered that this industry has been a significant contributor to financial scams. Between March 2021 and April 2022, the majority of these scams took place. Within the aforementioned time frame, 432 scams were examined and reported.<br /><br />Numerous financial frauds of all sorts have thrived in the cryptocurrency business. Large-scale unlawful transactions and money laundering have both been made possible by the sector. Recently, the UK has seen an upsurge in these crimes.<br /><br />It will be necessary for the team of authorities chosen for the job of cryptocurrency investigator to offer strategic and tactical guidance on how to circumvent such fraudulent actions. The officials should have a lot of expertise in conducting forensic blockchain investigations into large-scale, intentional wrongdoing.<br /><br />According to reports, only a small portion of the virtual asset teams are responsible for the project&#8217;s inquiry. Additionally, the unit of the National Crime Agency will initially consist of five officers.<br /><br />The UK government has made progress toward approving the sector by 2022, and then-chancellor Rishi Sunak had also made note of his aspirations to establish the UK as a <em>&#8220;crypto hub.&#8221;</em> Officials in the UK are nonetheless concerned about how the area has turned into a<em> &#8220;new front line&#8221;</em> for criminals.<br /><br />Later in 2022, lawmakers approved a bill giving the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) new authority to properly oversee the sector.<br /><br />According to Chris Lewis-Evans, a manager at the NCA:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Cryptocurrency and virtual assets are widely viewed as specialist areas of knowledge, and [the new roles are] key to supporting NCA investigations in which these are used to enable serious criminality.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Due to the prolonged downturn in this industry, many nations have had to review their regulatory frameworks. The value of some of the biggest market movers, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, has also fallen, prompting regulatory agencies to place a higher priority on protecting consumers from severe volatility.<br /><br />The collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-s-sbf-bows-out-following-liquidity-crunch/">FTX</a> in November was another significant event that caused upheaval inside the sector. Recent developments have made it more important than ever for countries to establish suitable regulatory frameworks for the cryptocurrency industry.</p>

<p>Expectations remain for a comeback of bulls in the crypto market come 2023, although such indications seem not yet certain. The crypto market is seeing slight selling pressure at press time, with <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/crypto-influencer-reveals-why-he-moved-from-solana-to-hedera-hbar-internet-computericp-and-algorand/">Hedera’s HBAR</a> token down 1.59% in the last 24 hours to $0.038. Pangolin, a multichain decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) on the Avalanche and Songbird Networks, has announced it will launch on Hedera. Pangolin is one of the most popular DEXs on the Avalanche blockchain, with over $16 billion in total trading volume. This year, Pangolin launched on the Songbird Network and announced plans for NEAR, Flare, and now Hedera. In other news, the Hashgraph Innovation Program, a joint initiative between the Swiss Hashgraph Association and the Swiss Digital Assets Institute (SDAI), has gotten off to a successful start. The Swiss Hashgraph Association, which is based in the Greater Zurich Area, is supporting a total of 35 projects that aim to develop innovative applications on the Hedera network. The blockchain funding program is being operated together with the Swiss Digital Assets Institute.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $0.0553, $0.0500, $0.0456<br />Support Levels: $0.0377, $0.0300, $0.0250</p>
<h4>HBAR/USD Daily Chart: Ranging</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1488" height="773" class="alignnone wp-image-63799 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HBARUSD-Daily-Jan-4-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HBARUSD-Daily-Jan-4-1.png 1488w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HBARUSD-Daily-Jan-4-1-300x156.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HBARUSD-Daily-Jan-4-1-1024x532.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HBARUSD-Daily-Jan-4-1-768x399.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HBARUSD-Daily-Jan-4-1-750x390.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HBARUSD-Daily-Jan-4-1-1140x592.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1488px) 100vw, 1488px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">HBAR/USD Daily Chart</span></em></h6>
<p>The <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/hbar-price-analysis-whats-next-for-hbar-price-top-investment-company-joins-hedera-governing-council/">HBAR/USD</a> opened lower at $0.0380 and rose to $0.0391 on Wednesday. As buyers appeared focused on levels above $0.0390, the pair continued to range. A decisive decline below $0.0380 must be produced to analyze the bearish situation. The pair may continue to tumble, with pessimistic traders eyeing the area below $0.0300 as a likely target.<br /><br />Growth from the December 31st low of $0.0355 is viewed as a likely rebound phase within a longer-term consolidation trend. More gains are predicted as long as the $0.0300 support level holds. A robust breakout of $0.0456, on the other hand, would signal the end of the continuation of the bounce from the $0.0355 low, bringing the upside back into focus.</p>
<h4>HBAR/USD 4-Hour Chart: Ranging</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1488" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63798 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HBARUSD-4-Hour-Jan-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HBARUSD-4-Hour-Jan-4.png 1488w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HBARUSD-4-Hour-Jan-4-300x139.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HBARUSD-4-Hour-Jan-4-1024x473.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HBARUSD-4-Hour-Jan-4-768x355.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HBARUSD-4-Hour-Jan-4-750x347.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HBARUSD-4-Hour-Jan-4-1140x527.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1488px) 100vw, 1488px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">HBAR/USD 4-Hour Chart</span></em></h6>
<p>The HBAR/USD is still trading in a range from its recent low of $0.0355, with an intraday tilt to the downside. If the last support level of $0.0377 holds, the price is likely to rise further. A significant return above $0.0456, on the other hand, will recoup all profits made in December.<br /><br />The next target will be a mid-term level of $0.0440 as the 4-hour relative strength index hits the neutral zone. A break of revised support at $0.0377, on the other hand, might reverse the expected uptrend and expand the range from $0.0388 with a fresh decline phase below the level at $0.0355.</p>
