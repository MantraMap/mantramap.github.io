Polkadot (DOT) has enjoyed a successful three-week period, with bullish investors maintaining their position at the forefront despite fluctuations in the market. In addition, the recent legal victory of Ripple against the US Securities and Exchange Commission triggered a positive response across the entire market, benefiting not only significant cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) but also altcoins in general.
