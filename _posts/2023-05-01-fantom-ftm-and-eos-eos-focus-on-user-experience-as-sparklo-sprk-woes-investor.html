<p class="s7">Sparklo Woes Investors With An Opportunity To Invest In Gold, Silver, and Platinum</p>
<p>Analysts are speculating that Sparklo will be the next lucrative venture. The blockchain will enable its users to stake in gold, silver, and platinum.</p>
<p>The project seeks to break the barriers that have existed for long between traditional metal trading platforms and investors by making the venture accessible to everyone. This will be done by</p>
● Decentralizing the metal market by bringing it to the blockchain
● Tokenizing the gold, silver, and platinum into SPRK tokens that investors can stake
● Availing fractional ownership of the metal assets on the Sparko platform thus reducing the entry barrier for investors. 
<p>At the moment Sparko is having a presale offer of only $0.015 plus a 30% bonus on all buys. The initial offer will last until the end of this weekend before it increases to $0.017.</p>
<p>Sparklo has been audited by Interfi Network and the team is currently processing a KYC application and will soon post the results. Additionally, Sparklo has announced that liquidity is locked for 100 years. </p>
