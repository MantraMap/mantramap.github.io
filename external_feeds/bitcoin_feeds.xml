South Africa has also claimed that 23 countries have formally applied for BRICS membership.</strong></p>
<h2>40+ Heads of State to Participate in BRICS Summit</h2>
<p>Nelson Kgwete, the South African foreign ministry’s media liaison officer, told Russian news outlet Tass that more than 40 heads of state have confirmed that they will participate in the BRICS summit that will take place on Aug. 22-24 in Johannesburg. South Africa is the host of the BRICS summit this year. He was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yes, confirmed, the summit will be attended by over 40 heads of state.</p></blockquote>
<p>All leaders of the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) are expected to attend the summit. However, Russian President Vladimir Putin <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/historic-brics-summit-to-be-held-without-putin-in-person/">will not attend in person</a>.</p>
<p>South Africa’s Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Naledi Pandor recently stated that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/23-countries-apply-for-brics-membership-as-leaders-prepare-to-convene-at-summit/">23 countries</a> have formally applied to join the BRICS economic bloc. They are Algeria, Argentina, Bangladesh, Bahrain, Belarus, Bolivia, Venezuela, Vietnam, Cuba, Honduras, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Morocco, Nigeria, State of Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, and Ethiopia. However, at least one of the 23 countries, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/morocco-denies-south-africas-claim-that-it-has-applied-to-join-brics/">Morocco</a>, has denied applying for BRICS membership.</p>

<p>Pandor further revealed that South Africa&#8217;s President Cyril Ramaphosa has invited 67 leaders of countries in Africa, Latin America, Asia, and the Caribbean to the summit. Moreover, 20 representatives of major international organizations have been invited, including the secretary-general of the United Nations, the chairperson of the African Union Commission, and the president of the New Development Bank, also known as the BRICS Bank.</p>
<p>Two key topics are expected to be discussed at the BRICS summit: the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brazils-president-reaffirms-de-dollarization-call-discusses-brics-expansion/">expansion</a> of the economic bloc and the push to increase settlements using national currencies. In addition, some expect the topic of a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russian-official-says-brics-currency-could-be-discussed-at-upcoming-summit/">common BRICS currency</a> to be addressed at the summit. However, the top South African diplomat in charge of BRICS relations has said that the topic of a shared currency for the BRICS nations is not on the agenda to be discussed at the summit.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin v Stock Market in 1930s</h2>
<p>Mike McGlone, a senior commodity strategist for Bloomberg Intelligence (BI), the research arm of Bloomberg, has pointed out the similarity between bitcoin and the stock market in 1930. He tweeted on Monday:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the best-performing assets in history and a leading indicator — bitcoin — appears similar to the stock market in 1930.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Statistician and entrepreneur Roger Babson began warning about elevated equity prices well before economist Irving Fisher proclaimed a ‘permanently high plateau’ in 1929,” the commodity strategist added, emphasizing: “The Fed tilts our bias toward a stance similar to Babson&#8217;s.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-603566 aligncenter" title="Market Strategist Draws Parallels Between Bitcoin and 1930 Stock Market Crash" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mcglone-tweet-bitcoin-stock-market.jpg" alt="Market Strategist Draws Parallels Between Bitcoin and 1930 Stock Market Crash" width="780" height="900" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mcglone-tweet-bitcoin-stock-market-260x300.jpg 260w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mcglone-tweet-bitcoin-stock-market-768x886.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mcglone-tweet-bitcoin-stock-market-696x803.jpg 696w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mcglone-tweet-bitcoin-stock-market.jpg 780w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>

<p>Babson told a National Business Conference in Massachusetts in September 1929 that “sooner or later a crash is coming which will take in the leading stocks and cause a decline from 60 to 80 points in the Dow-Jones barometer.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased nearly six-fold from sixty-three in August 1921 to 381 in September 1929. The epic boom culminated in a catastrophic crash. From April 1930 to July 1932, the Dow suffered a loss of 89.2%. The stock market crash of 1929, also called the Great Crash, contributed to the Great Depression of the 1930s which lasted approximately 10 years.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve has increased interest rates to the highest level in 22 years, as it continues to fight persistent inflation in the U.S. economy. In July, the Fed <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-reserve-raises-federal-funds-rate-by-25bps-amidst-moderate-economic-growth/">raised</a> its key interest rate by 25 basis points to a range of 5.25%-5.5%. Fed officials have said that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-reserve-governor-hints-at-more-interest-rate-hikes/">more rate hikes</a> may be needed to bring inflation down toward the central bank&#8217;s 2% target.</p>

This revelation, in a report penned by Michael Faulkender and David Vasquez, highlights the probable perils associated with the Federal Reserve&#8217;s direct issuance of a digital dollar.</strong></p>
<h2>AFPI: A CBDC &#8216;Would Represent the Greatest Threat to What Little Financial Privacy and Data Security Americans Enjoy&#8217;</h2>
<p>According to the AFPI&#8217;s <a href="https://assets.americafirstpolicy.com/assets/uploads/files/Research_Report_-_Central_Bank_Digital_Currencies.pdf">report</a>, introducing a CBDC could grant the government unparalleled access to all financial transactions, eroding citizens&#8217; privacy. They reference the IRS&#8217;s recent <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/09/04/1121061081/irs-data-mistake-public-congress">data exposures</a> as an indication that federal agencies might not be equipped to handle Americans&#8217; transaction data safely.</p>
<p>Moreover, the report cautions that a CBDC might allow authorities to selectively ostracize certain groups from the financial landscape. A case in point: the covert <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323838204578654411043000772">Obama-era Operation Choke Point</a>, which saw officials nudging banks to sever ties with entities like payday lenders and gun dealers.</p>
<p>“The operation was hidden from the American people for four years until it ended in 2017, with several high-level officials even lying about the existence of the program,” the AFPI report notes. “The actions of the federal government during Operation Choke Point underscore the heart of the issue with giving the federal government full authority to bypass the law in accessing and censoring Americans’ financial privacy and assets.”</p>
<p>Faulkender and Vasquez further emphasize the dangers of equipping the federal government with unchecked power, as seen in their ability to circumvent legal processes, accessing and potentially censoring Americans&#8217; fiscal data and assets.</p>
<p>The report also casts doubt on the Federal Reserve&#8217;s capacity to launch a CBDC, given recent missteps — namely unprecedented inflation and major bank crashes. Notably, in H1 of 2023, the U.S. witnessed three of its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_bank_failures_in_the_United_States">largest bank failures</a>. The AFPI authors firmly believe that it&#8217;s Congress, not the Fed, that should decide on the creation of a digital dollar.</p>
<p>The AFPI report urges clarity, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>The fact is: The Federal Reserve cannot issue a CBDC without Congressional authority. Congress must make this clear by enacting legislation that restricts the creation and use of a CBDC.</p></blockquote>

<p>In summation, the report suggests that while emerging payment innovations might be advantageous, these gains needn&#8217;t be at the expense of consolidating fiscal control under the Federal Reserve&#8217;s authority. Both authors implore Congress to delineate boundaries on the Federal Reserve&#8217;s scope to initiate a digital currency, alluding to severe invasions of privacy and autonomy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="696" height="392" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/secer.webp" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="Gemini Challenges SEC Lawsuit on Lending Program, Pushes for Oral Hearing" decoding="async" loading="lazy" style="float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;" /><p><strong>Lawyers for cryptocurrency exchange Gemini have filed a motion seeking to dismiss a lawsuit brought against it by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over its Gemini Earn lending program. In the motion, Gemini argues the SEC has failed to plausibly allege that any securities laws were violated.</strong></p>
<h2>Gemini Moves to Dismiss SEC Claims, Advocates for Oral Argument</h2>
<p>Earlier this year, the SEC <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-charges-genesis-and-gemini-winklevoss-says-regulators-lawsuit-is-super-lame/">accused</a> Gemini and its associate, Genesis Global Capital, of illicitly offering and vending unregistered securities via the Gemini Earn program. According to the SEC, both the program&#8217;s Master Digital Asset Loan Agreement and the program itself were unregistered securities unlawfully offered and sold.</p>
<p>Gemini, however, has fired back in its <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.592343/gov.uscourts.nysd.592343.42.0.pdf">motion to dismiss</a> which seeks an oral hearing. The firm challenges the SEC&#8217;s inability to provide evidence of actual &#8220;sales&#8221; of securities — a crucial component to prove a violation of the Securities Act.</p>
<p>Gemini emphasizes that the SEC&#8217;s allegations are ambiguous about when, how, or to whom these supposed securities sales happened. Furthermore, they question if any transactions concerning the loan agreement or lending scheme were ever exchanged &#8220;for value,&#8221; a vital aspect of what defines a securities sale.</p>
<p>The motion underscores that the SEC seems to be merely highlighting loans under the program instead of actual securities sales. It insists there&#8217;s a lack of concrete evidence suggesting any transfer of interests in the loan contract or the program. Just because something could be deemed a security, Gemini retorts, doesn&#8217;t indicate a Securities Act breach in the absence of specific sales events.</p>
<p class="p1"></p>
<p>Furthermore, Gemini points out inconsistencies in the SEC&#8217;s stance. The SEC sometimes labels the loan agreement as the security while elsewhere it suggests the entire lending program is. Gemini underlines this blurred distinction as a critical flaw in the SEC&#8217;s case.</p>
<p>The dismissal motion stresses the SEC&#8217;s oversight in detailing sale conditions, pricing strategies, ownership transfers, or other markers pointing to real sales. Gemini asserts that the SEC is blurring the lines between proving a security&#8217;s existence and showing actual transaction evidence.</p>
<p>Based on civil procedure principles and statutory interpretation norms, Gemini pushes for a dismissal. They argue that the SEC&#8217;s claims lack plausibility and emphasize that the court should stick to the statute&#8217;s clear language, which Gemini believes hasn&#8217;t been fulfilled. The exchange already <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/gemini-and-genesis-fight-back-against-sec-lawsuit-seek-dismissal-of-allegations/">pushed for a dismissal</a> at the end of May after Gemini co-founder, <span style="font-weight: 400;">Tyler Winklevoss,</span> called the SEC’s enforcement lawsuit “super lame.”</p>

However, a post published by Binance&#8217;s customer support team at 12:21 p.m. (ET) on Monday notes the service will officially halt on September 25, 2023. </strong></p>
<h2>Binance to Suspend EUR SEPA Transactions</h2>
<p>On Monday, August 19, 2023, Binance&#8217;s dedicated <a href="https://twitter.com/BinanceHelpDesk/status/1691030085292445696?s=20">customer support channel</a>, the X account, <a href="https://twitter.com/BinanceHelpDesk/status/1693516911479230754?s=20">stated</a> that SEPA transfers for EUR are currently on hold. “Please be informed that currently, direct bank transfer for EUR currency is in maintenance,” the support channel informed a user. In subsequent messages to select Binance patrons, the exchange articulated their efforts to rectify the situation.</p>
<p>“We regret to inform you that we have temporarily suspended EUR withdrawals and deposits via SEPA,” the Binance customer support message detailed. “Unfortunately, our provider can no longer support these transactions. We understand the inconvenience this has caused, and we&#8217;re actively working to resolve this as soon as possible. However, at the moment, we don&#8217;t have a specific time frame for the restoration of SEPA transfers.”</p>
<p>While some have complained that the service has already been halted, Binance&#8217;s customer support team <a href="https://twitter.com/BinanceHelpDesk/status/1693659553383223553?s=20">stated</a> that the &#8220;SEPA deposit and withdrawal service will continue&#8221; until September 25, 2023. It noted that some customer support messages were sent in error.</p>

<p>Throughout 2023, Binance grappled with multiple setbacks tied to payment intermediaries handling fiat transactions. Binance US, their American branch, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-us-records-massive-discrepancies-as-usd-exchange-rates-plummet-by-16-in-july/">experienced discrepancies</a> in crypto values due to complications with USD withdrawals. Earlier in the year, following the downfall of three crypto-friendly banks, it came to light that Binance US was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-binance-us-struggles-to-secure-banking-partner-amid-regulatory-crackdown-on-crypto-industry/">facing challenges</a> securing a banking ally. A comparable <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-australia-users-selling-bitcoin-at-discount-ahead-of-aud-withdrawals-halt/">predicament unfolded</a> with Binance Australia as AUD withdrawals got suspended.</p>

<h2>Litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>)</h2>
<p>Litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>) rose for a third consecutive session on Monday, as the token continued to move away from a recent nine-month low.</p>
<p>Following a bottom at $64.33 on Sunday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>/USD jumped to an intraday peak of $66.70 earlier in the day.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a> has mostly been in the green since falling to its lowest point since November, during last week&#x2019;s session.</p>

<p>As a result of recent bearish momentum, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) dropped below the 20.00 mark.</p>
<p>Currently, the index is at a reading of 21.13, which is marginally below an upcoming resistance level of 23.00.</p>
<p>If litecoin were to break out of this level, the next price target will likely be $70.00.</p>

<h2>Ethereum Classic (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETC" target="_blank">ETC</a>)</h2>
<p>Additionally, ethereum classic also moved higher to start the week, following a recent drop below a floor at $15.00.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETC" target="_blank">ETC</a>/USD rose to a high of $15.90 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $15.38.</p>

<p>Today&#x2019;s peak sees ethereum classic trade at its highest point since last Thursday, when price was over $16.00.</p>
<p>Price strength on <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETC" target="_blank">ETC</a> is now hovering around 28.00, with a ceiling of 29.00 the next obstacle to overcome.</p>
<p>Should it rise beyond this hurdle, there is a good chance that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETC" target="_blank">ETC</a> will be above $16.00.</p>

Additionally, over the past seven days, Ordinal inscriptions represented a hefty 53.9% of all transaction activity on the Bitcoin network.</strong></p>
<h2>Ordinals&#x2019; Unprecedented Impact: 53% of Bitcoin&#x2019;s Weekly Transactions Defined by Inscriptions</h2>
<p>Fast forward to 8:15 a.m. Eastern Time on Monday morning August 21, 2023, a significant <a href="https://dune.com/dgtl_assets/bitcoin-ordinals-analysis">25,620,164</a> Ordinal inscriptions now grace the Bitcoin blockchain. Just a day ago on Sunday, the network witnessed the minting of Ordinals spike to its second-highest volume ever with <a href="https://dune.com/queries/2008613/3324931">411,511 inscriptions</a>. Still topping the chart is July 30, 2023, when a record 422,164 inscriptions were minted in a single day.</p>

<p>A recently published <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/study-bitcoin-ordinal-nft-sales-nosedive-as-broader-market-cools/">Dappradar report</a>, which suggests a 97% drop in Ordinal inscription sales from their peak, has generated significant buzz and controversy. An X user, <a href="https://twitter.com/TO">Trevor.btc</a>, has <a href="https://twitter.com/TO/status/1693299546359480729?s=20">questioned its accuracy</a>. He cites data from Dune Analytics and Cryptoslam.io that show a decline of 67% to 68%. Trevor.btc also criticized the report for not including BRC20 activity, an essential aspect of the Ordinals inscription trend.</p>
<p>In Trevor.btc&#x2019;s words:</p>
<blockquote><p>Did Ordinals speed-run a hype cycle? Absolutely. Is Ordinals volume down significantly compared to the peak? Yes. Could it go down further? Sure. But so what? The Ordinals market is no different than any other new asset in the space and no different from what we&#x2019;ve seen on other NFT ecosystems. These things come and go in cycles.</p></blockquote>

<p>Notably, NFT aficionado and founder of Ord.io, Leonidas, recently highlighted the substantial activity surrounding Ordinal inscriptions. On Sunday, he <a href="https://twitter.com/LeonidasNFT/status/1693327504184922274?s=20">remarked</a>, &#x201C;Ordinals accounted for 53.9% of the activity on Bitcoin this week. Ordinals transactions: 1,974,803. Bitcoin transactions: 3,660,831. The only people saying that Ordinals are dead are the ones who feel threatened by them.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The latest data from <a href="https://dune.com/queries/2008613/3324931">Dune Analytics</a> and <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_transactions_per_day#:~:text=Basic%20Info,registered%20on%20the%20Bitcoin%20network.">ycharts.com</a> shows that of the 612,461 transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain on August 20, roughly 411,511 were Ordinal inscriptions, translating to 67.18% of all the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> transactions that day. Moving into August 21, over 36,000 inscriptions have been recorded so far. It&#x2019;s also noteworthy that the pending transaction count as of this Monday stands at 347,640 unconfirmed transactions, or a sizeable 223 megabytes of block space waiting to be cleared.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin was marginally higher to start the week, as the cryptocurrency climbed back above the $26,000 level on Monday.</p>
<p>Following a low of $25,919.02 on Sunday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD rose to an intraday peak at $26,260.68 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Overall, bitcoin traders seem to have found a semi-stable floor around the $25,900 mark, and now look set to potentially recover some of last week&#x2019;s gains.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, the relative strength index (RSI) is now tracking at 20.57, which is still deep in the oversold region.</p>
<p>This could work out to benefit bulls however, as bearish momentum may be fully exhausted after last week&#x2019;s run.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) was marginally higher on Monday, as price continued to settle around a new support point.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD hit a high of $1,692.33 to start the week, as bulls attempted to take the world&#x2019;s second largest cryptocurrency back above $1,700.</p>
<p>The jump in price came as ethereum settled on a support point around the $1,650 mark, with bulls using this as a point of reentry.</p>

</div>
<p>Similar to bitcoin above, the 14-day RSI remains oversold, and is currently tracking around the 25.00 region.</p>
<p>From the chart, the next visible point of resistance seems to be at the 31.00 level, which bulls will likely be targeting.</p>
<p>Should they break out of this point, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> will likely move back above $1,700.</p>

For admitting to committing the offense, Helio is said to have entered a &#8220;recognisance&#8221; of $9,560 (AUD15,000) for 12 months which is contingent on the crypto lender’s good behavior.</strong></p>
<h2>Helio Said to Be in Breach of Australian Consumer Protection Law</h2>
<p>The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) announced on Aug. 17 that the Melbourne-based cryptocurrency lender Helio Lending has been sentenced for falsely claiming it held a credit license. According to the regulator, such a claim is in breach of section 30 of Australia’s National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2023-releases/23-223mr-cryptocurrency-lender-sentenced-for-false-licence-claims/">statement</a>, the Aussie securities regulator revealed that the license claim was made in an article that appeared on Helio&#8217;s website in Aug. 2019. The regulator argued that Helio portrayed itself as a licensed entity when it knew full well that it was not a holder of the Australian Credit License (ACL).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>
<p>Commenting on her organization’s punishment of Helio, ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We expect entities and individuals to provide accurate information to their customers and potential customers. Helio falsely claimed that it held an Australian Credit Licence (ACL), misleading their customers to believe that they had the protections afforded by such a licence.</p></blockquote>
<p>For admitting to committing the offense, Helio is said to have entered a “recognisance” of $9,560 (AUD15,000) for 12 months which is contingent on the crypto lender’s good behavior. However, the regulator said the second charge relating to the content seen on Helio’s website has since been withdrawn.</p>

At the same time, the surge of energy prices due to Covid, heatwaves, and the war in Ukraine render bitcoin mining largely unprofitable throughout Europe. </strong></p>
<h2>Mining 1 Bitcoin Would Cost $266 in Lebanon, an Italian Miner Would Pay Over $208,000</h2>
<p>A solo miner would need an average of 266,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity to mint a single bitcoin and the process would take approximately seven years to complete, requiring a monthly electricity consumption of about 143 kWh, researchers have estimated.</p>
<p>While admitting that the days are gone when bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) could be mined with minimal power and on a desktop computer, they have analyzed household electricity costs across the globe to present prospects for solo miners operating within a decentralized network.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/bitcoin-mining-cost" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a> produced by the crypto asset aggregation portal Coingecko, the average cost of the household electricity needed to mine 1 bitcoin is $46,291.24, which was 35% higher than the average daily price of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> in July 2023, or $30,090.08.</p>
<p>However, the regional differences in household electricity costs around the world are significant. With an average cost of $20,635.62 per bitcoin, Asia &#x201C;stands as the sole territory where the average household electricity costs make mining profitable for a solo miner,&#x201D; the authors point out.</p>
<p>They also highlight the significant disparity between the countries in the region, where <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/lebanese-mint-keep-spend-crypto-amid-crisis-report-unveils/">Lebanon</a> has the lowest electricity cost of $266.20 and Japan has the highest, at $64,111.02. Nevertheless, half of the top 10 countries where bitcoin mining is most profitable are Asian.</p>

<h2>Europe With Highest Average Cost of Household Electricity for Mining</h2>
<p>Only 65 countries currently present profitability for solo mining based on household electricity costs alone. Just five of them are in Europe, which has the highest average cost of household electricity, at $85,767.84. Nine of the top 10 most unprofitable countries for solo miners are in that region, with the electricity cost to mint 1 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> in Italy reaching $208,560.33.</p>
<p>Various factors have contributed to the increase of household power rates on the Old Continent, including the spike in wholesale electricity prices amid the Covid-19 pandemic, growing demand, heatwaves, and Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine which affected natural gas deliveries for a number of EU member states.</p>
<p>The researchers also emphasize that the hourly amount of electricity used in the mining of 1 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, 4.6 kWh, is not as disparate as one might think when compared to the consumption of other household appliances such as an electric kettle, with 3.5 kWh, or a clothes dryer that burns an average of 5 kWh. Also, the monthly electricity required to mint a single bitcoin is roughly one-sixth of what a typical household in the U.S. consumed in 2021.</p>
