			            <description><![CDATA[A Bloomberg analyst pointed out what puts the US ahead of Europe in terms of adoption. Hint, it has something to do with BTC ETFs.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price has basically been on pause since mid-June, as the asset trades range-bound since then. The exchange rate of BTC to USD remained above $29,000, with resistance at $30,000. It&#8217;s as if markets are waiting on the SEC&#8217;s spot Bitcoin ETF approvals.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/weird-signal-bitcoin-5-day-volatility-inversion-with-wall-st-what-does-it-mean-for-btc/" data-wpel-link="internal">one metric of</a> bitcoin&#8217;s price stability touched five-year historic lows at the beginning of August. Weirdly, BTC was even less volatile than U.S. stocks briefly this month.</p>
<p>But with each new application for a spot Bitcoin ETF, there&#8217;s more bullish pressure on BTC&#8217;s chart. Institutional investors are wetting their whistle for blockchain exposure via an ETF product they can understand, with a Tradfi partner they can trust.</p>
<p>The list of spot <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/fidelity-vaneck-invesco-amend-bitcoin-spot-etf-filings-following-secs-warning-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">ETF applications for Bitcoin</a> is long and growing. When the first approval comes, market watchers are expecting a big upswing in exchange prices.</p>
<h2>US Dominates World Crypto ETF Volumes</h2>
<p>Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas recently pointed out in a (Twitter) X post that &#8220;Every single one of the Top 15 best-performing equity ETFs this year is crypto-related.&#8221; Furthermore, Balchunas added that a spot Bitcoin ETF would send North American crypto ETF volumes to 99.5% of the global market.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Every single one of the Top 15 best performing equity ETFs this year is crypto-related. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24WGMI&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">$WGMI</a> leading way w +227%. Finally attracting flows too, altho pretty modest considering these perf numbers. This is part of our monthly Crypto ETF Report via <a href="https://twitter.com/JSeyff?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@JSeyff</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/SirYappityyapp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@SirYappityyapp</a> <a href="https://t.co/iPIHhH82Jr" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/iPIHhH82Jr</a></p>
<p>— Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1689655154470232064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">August 10, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The real stunner is that, in the first place, that figure is already 97.67%.</p>
<p>ETFs are a preferred way to get blockchain exposure for institutional and Tradfi players. This shows how far ahead of European Tradfi companies and baby boomers US investors are at taking the disruptions of the cryptocurrency industry seriously.</p>
<h2>US Tradfi Players Far More Open to Blockchain</h2>
<p>The differences in US versus European openness to blockchain and cryptocurrencies are shocking by this metric. Sophisticated European investors are nearly entirely passing on crypto ETFs despite some of the face-melting ROIs.</p>
<p>One contributing factor to this sizeable delta is that Americans have a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2022/04/13/cultural-differences-explain-the-business-chasm-between-the-us-and-europe/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">greater appetite</a> for risk in business ventures and financial investments. That&#8217;s backed by research that has found:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;People living in Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands are the most risk-averse, while those in the US, Turkey, Australia, and the UK are more accepting of risk.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Another factor may be how well the traditional American values of individual liberty and private property line up with blockchain&#8217;s free market.</p>
<p>It may be that cryptocurrency businesses and advocates in the Eurozone can find more success promoting the industry&#8217;s products by emphasizing how they align with the values of fairness, social justice, and progress.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[3 years after making its first historical bitcoin purchase, Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy now holds nearly 153,000 BTC.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">MicroStrategy&#8217;s co-founder and executive chairman, Michael Saylor, who served as the company&#8217;s former CEO for over 30 years, continues to remain bullish on bitcoin three years after his publicly-traded business intelligence company decided to make its first BTC purchase.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Saylor has also made big price predictions for the asset, believing its value could exceed $1 million per coin.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">MicroStrategy Holds Nearly 153,000 BTC 3 Years Later</h2>
<p dir="ltr">MicroStrategy <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/first-of-many-nasdaq-listed-company-buys-250-million-in-bitcoin-as-inflation-hedge/" data-wpel-link="internal">made history</a> and headlines on August 11, 2020, after becoming the first publicly-traded company to purchase bitcoin. The firm initially hinted in July 2020 about its plans to invest in assets such as bitcoin or gold rather than holding cash, as a way to escape inflation, with the company later deciding to buy BTC worth $250 million and adopting it as its primary treasury reserve asset.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to Saylor at the time, who was MicroStrategy&#8217;s CEO, the decision to go for bitcoin was made because the cryptocurrency served as a better hedge against inflation and had a higher return on investment compared to other assets.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That first purchase marked the beginning of several investments amid the crypto&#8217;s volatile price movements, causing the company to hold a large BTC stash. In June 2023, Saylor announced that the business intelligence giant <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/microstrategy-buys-12333-btc-for-350-million-at-28k-per-bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">bought 12,333 BTC</a> for $347 million, making it one of the company&#8217;s largest purchases in a single quarter since Q2 2021.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As of July 31, 2023, MicroStrategy <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/microstrategy-buys-another-420-btc-for-14-4-million/" data-wpel-link="internal">holds 152,800 BTC</a>, which the company said was purchased for $4.53 billion at an average purchase price of $29,672 per bitcoin. The business intelligence software firm is the largest corporate holder of bitcoin.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, in a December 2022 SEC filing, MicroStrategy revealed that it <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/heres-why-microstrategy-sold-704-bitcoins-on-december-22/" data-wpel-link="internal">sold</a> 704 BTC to generate tax benefits. The sale was a first for the company, with the action contrary to a previous statement by Saylor, who said MicroStrategy would never sell any of its stash.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Saylor Continues to Solidify Bitcoin Support</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Saylor is known as one of bitcoin&#8217;s biggest supporters and has continued to promote the asset as far superior to gold, calling it the &#8220;digital gold.&#8221; However, he was not always pro-bitcoin, as he predicted the asset&#8217;s imminent demise in a 2013 tweet, stating that it would suffer the same fate as online gambling.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But Saylor&#8217;s view on bitcoin has since changed, and not only has the billionaire spearheaded several BTC purchases at MicroStrategy while also making personal acquisitions, he has also made big price predictions for the number one cryptocurrency.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The MicroStrategy executive chairman in May 2022 <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-will-go-into-the-millions-predicts-microstrategys-michael-saylor/" data-wpel-link="internal">said</a> BTC&#8217;s price could &#8220;go into the millions&#8221; while stating that it is the future of money. The following month, Saylor predicted that bitcoin&#8217;s price will skyrocket to $1 million.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Later in September 2022, the exec said the cryptocurrency could be <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/michael-saylor-sees-bitcoin-trading-at-69000-in-the-next-four-years/" data-wpel-link="internal">valued at $500,000</a> in the next 10 years if it matches the market capitalization of gold. For context, BTC&#8217;s market cap is $572.3 billion, while gold&#8217;s is currently estimated at $12.8 trillion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Also, Saylor seems to be unfazed by the ongoing enforcement crackdown on the crypto sector by the US SEC, stating that the regulator&#8217;s action could <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/michael-saylor-thinks-the-sec-crackdown-could-boost-bitcoins-dominance-to-80/" data-wpel-link="internal">benefit</a> bitcoin by boosting the asset&#8217;s price and increasing its market share dominance to 80%.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Saylor, who served as MicroStrategy&#8217;s CEO for over 30 years, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/michael-saylor-is-no-longer-the-ceo-of-microstrategy/" data-wpel-link="internal">left</a> his position in August 2022 to become the company&#8217;s executive officer, with MicroStrategy president Phong Le serving as the new CEO. The American business executive explained that his new role will help him to better focus on the firm&#8217;s &#8220;bitcoin acquisition strategy and related bitcoin advocacy initiatives.&#8221;</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[In contrast, KAS and HBAR have soared by double-digits in the past 24 hours. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s troubles continue as the asset has returned below $26,000 after exceeding that level yesterday following the price flash crash.</p>
<p>Most altcoins have also seen daily declines, with ETH and BNB dropping by 1.5% once more.</p>
<h2>BTC Still Below $26K</h2>
<p>The primary cryptocurrency was stuck in a tight range between $29,200 and $29,500 for a week until a few days ago. It tried to break out toward $30,000 on Monday but was stopped in its tracks, and the subsequent rejection pushed it back south to around $29,000.</p>
<p>By Thursday, BTC had lost half a grand more, but the worst was yet to come. <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-btc-flash-crash-to-25-3k-triggers-speculation-spacex-write-down-in-focus/" data-wpel-link="internal">Speculations</a> arose that SpaceX had disposed of its remaining bitcoin stash, and the asset reacted with an immediate <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-crashed-to-25-3-but-these-altcoins-have-it-worse-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">price drop</a> that drove it all the way down to $25,300 on several exchanges.</p>
<p>This became its lowest price tag in just over two months. BTC bounced off initially and reclaimed $26,000, but another 1-2% decline in the past 24 hours has pushed it to just under that level.</p>
<p>Its market cap is close to breaking below $500 billion, while its dominance over the alts is at 48.1%.</p>

<h2>Alts Tumble Weekly</h2>
<p>Most alternative coins tumbled just as badly in the past few days, wiping more than $110 billion from the total market cap.</p>
<p>The past 24 hours have been less volatile, but still some of the largest are in the red today, including ETH and BNB. Both have declined by about 1.5% and sit at $1,660 and $215, respectively.</p>
<p>The situation is a lot worse on a weekly scale. XRP, SHIB, and LTC are among the poorest performers, declining by more than 20% since last Saturday.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are two impressive gainers from the top 100 alts &#8211; HBAR and KAS. Both have soared by 13-16% and HBAR has reclaimed $0.06, while KAS is above $0.04.</p>

<p>According to an official release from the ASIC, Helio was <a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2023-releases/23-223mr-cryptocurrency-lender-sentenced-for-false-licence-claims/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">sentenced</a> to a non-conviction bond and entered into a recognizance of A$15,000 ($9,600) for 12 months on the condition of good behavior.</p>
<h2>ASIC Sentences Helio</h2>
<p>The Australian securities regulator <a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2022-releases/22-085mr-cryptocurrency-lender-charged-for-false-australian-credit-licence-claims/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">charged</a> Helio in April 2022, accusing the firm of falsely representing in a news article on its website that it held an ACL, whereas it did not. The lender also <a href="https://www.fundingstrategies.com.au/assets/resources/Helio_Lending_secures_Cash_Flow_Investments__Final_16nov18.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">mentioned</a> in an investor update that it obtained the license through the acquisition of CashFlow Investments.</p>
<p>However, on both occasions, Helio, which offered crypto-backed loans, was neither an ACL holder nor a representative of an ACL holder, according to the ASIC. The firm’s conduct violated section 30 of the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009.</p>
<p>The crypto lender pleaded guilty to ASIC’s charges, and the regulator considered the plea during the sentencing. The Commission withdrew a second charge relating to alleged content on Helio’s website in February 2019 and sentenced the firm under section 19B(1)(d) of the Crimes Act 1914(Cth).</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said: “We expect entities and individuals to provide accurate information to their customers and potential customers. Helio falsely claimed that it held an Australian Credit license, misleading their customers to believe that they had the protections afforded by such a license.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>ASIC’s Crackdown on Crypto Firms</h2>
<p>The ASIC has recently initiated a crackdown on several crypto firms. Helio’s sentencing comes just two weeks after the regulator sued crypto-related trading platform eToro over claims that its contract for difference (CFD) product could harm investors.</p>
<p>A CFD is a leveraged derivative product that enables users to speculate on the prices of digital assets. eToro was among the first firms to allow bitcoin trading via CFDs and later added support for other cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p><em>CryptoPotato</em> <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/australias-financial-regulator-sues-etoro-details/" data-wpel-link="internal">reported</a> that the Aussie regulator argued eToro’s CFD products might not have been tested properly before they were introduced to users due to their high risk and volatility.</p>
<p>The agency also estimated that roughly 20,000 eToro customers lost money between October 2021 and June 2023 while trading CFDs.The crypto lending platform pleaded guilty to ASIC’s charges, and the regulator considered the plea during sentencing.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The SEC claims an appeal is justified given the grounds for "difference of opinion" on crypto's relationship with securities law between different courts. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed a motion requesting permission to appeal a federal court ruling last month claiming that secondary sales of Ripple’s XRP token are not securities.</p>
<p>The agency argued that there are still “substantial grounds for difference of opinion” regarding how securities laws apply to crypto, making frequent reference to a similar case involving Terraform Labs where the judge ruled differently.</p>
<h2>Ripple Case Not Over?</h2>
<p>The motion, <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.551082/gov.uscourts.nysd.551082.893.0.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">filed</a> on Friday, contested two of Judge Analisa Torres‘s rulings last month: one that “Programmatic Sales” of XRP (ex. secondary market sales) did not satisfy Howey, and another that “Other Distributions” (ex. Payments for services) also failed to do so.</p>
<blockquote><p>“There are significant grounds for difference of opinion on the correctness of both rulings,” wrote the agency. “Since this Court’s decision, another court in this district explicitly disagreed with the Order’s ruling on the Programmatic Sales.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Shortly after the Ripple ruling, Terraform Labs attempted to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/judge-rejects-terraforms-attempt-to-capitalize-on-ripple-precedent-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">capitalize</a> with a motion to dismiss a similar SEC case against the firm, alleging securities fraud for failing to register its now failed TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin.</p>
<p>District Judge Jed Rakoff rejected the group’s reasoning, however, refusing to distinguish “institutional” and “secondary” market sales in regards to being a security. “Howey makes no such distinction,” he wrote at the time.</p>
<p>The agency referenced numerous prior cases – including its charges against Telegram and <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/can-ripple-xrp-lose-against-the-sec-lawyers-debate-following-lbry-lawsuit-judgment/" data-wpel-link="internal">LBRY</a> – as proof that courts have already identified securities act violations when transactions occurred through intermediaries, including through exchanges.</p>
<blockquote><p>“In the opinion of the Terraform court, for example, the inquiry turns on what the issuer objectively invites investors to understand, and not on the method of carrying out the transaction,” argued the SEC.</p></blockquote>
<p>The agency added that the source of purchase for XRP should not affect whether Ripple had established a reasonable expectation of profit for investors – one of the core pillars defining an investment contract.</p>
<h2>Lawyers Give Their Take</h2>
<p>Bitcoin-supportive litigator Joe Carlesare expressed support for the SEC’s appeal on Friday, agreeing that a crypto issuer’s promotions equally impact both direct purchasers and secondary market buyers.</p>
<blockquote><p>“This is the economic reality of the crypto market — where most participants are relying on the team/devs to promote/develop the token,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeCarlasare/status/1692614892790919367" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">said</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, XRP supportive lawyer Sandy Seth called the SEC’s position “utterly ridiculous,” given that the agency didn’t appeal Torres’s ruling that XRP itself is a security.</p>
<blockquote><p>“So if XRP is not a security how can sales of XRP be a sales of a security?” he <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoDukeji/status/1692651462264750313" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">asked</a>.</p></blockquote>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A United States judge has ruled that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) can seek assistance from the South Korean government in interviewing Daniel Shin, co-founder of Terraform Labs, along with Do Kwon.</p>
<p>US District Judge Jed Rakoff ruled on Thursday that the SEC is permitted to utilize a procedure outlined in a 1970 treaty that regulates international evidence-gathering requests. Despite denying any misconduct, Kwon did not contest SEC&#8217;s request.</p>
<ul>
<li>As part of the <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66820843/45/securities-and-exchange-commission-v-terraform-labs-pte-ltd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">motion</a> granted by Judge Rakoff, the SEC also intends to obtain evidence from Chai Corp., the Seoul-based payments company founded by Kwon.</li>
<li>The move is part of the SEC&#8217;s strategy to validate the accusations made in the lawsuit against Terraform and its former CEO.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66820843/45/securities-and-exchange-commission-v-terraform-labs-pte-ltd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">lawsuit</a>, filed in February by the SEC, accuses TFL and Kwon of orchestrating a multi-billion dollar crypto asset securities fraud involving the now-defunct algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD and other alleged crypto securities.</li>
<li>The relationship between Chai and Terra has been a bone of contention. Several reports have hinted that Kwon may have overstated the extent and duration of the relationship between Terra and the e-commerce system.</li>
<li>The SEC made a startling allegation that Chai Payments did not use the Terraform blockchain to process and settle payments as per the partnership deal of 2019.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Rather, Defendants deceptively replicated Chai payments onto the Terraform blockchain, in order to make it appear that they were occurring on the Terraform blockchain, when, in fact, Chai payments were made through traditional means.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In addition to the SEC lawsuit, Kwon is facing criminal charges in the US as well as in South Korea.</li>
<li>The disgraced exec had previously <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/do-kwon-sorry-for-cocky-tweets-takes-full-responsibility-for-terras-collapse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">stated</a> that the charges leveled against him by the prosecutors of his home country are &#8220;politically motivated.&#8221;</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[Bitcoin Ordinals have seen a consistent decline in sales volume and transactions since June, possibly signaling waning interest in Bitcoin NFTs.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The fervor that surrounded Bitcoin Ordinals seems to have waned, with sales volume dropping more than 97% from its all-time high in May 2023.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, some community members believe Bitcoin Ordinals are not dead, some others state that the earlier hype was a major cause of its crash, arguing that Bitcoin is better off maintaining its primary function as a store of value.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">A 97% Crash Within 3 Months</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin Ordinals have seen a sharp decline in sales volume from its peak of $452 million recorded in May 2023 to $3 million in mid-August, signaling a 97% drop within three months, according to a <a href="https://dappradar.com/blog/ordinals-sales-down-97-since-may-are-bitcoin-nfts-over" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">report</a> by DappRadar.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After an impressive performance in May, Bitcoin Ordinals&#8217; sales volume began to nosedive in June, falling 76.5% to $100 million. July did not fare any better, with sales volume further plunging 66.9% to $35 million. Data for August so far shows a 91.4% drop in sales to $3 million.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Apart from sales volume, transactions have also reduced since May, with the report revealing that transactions have plummeted to 88.1% in August at 20,571, compared to 832,648 three months ago.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While there has been a downward trend in the general non-fungible token (NFT) market, Bitcoin Ordinals seem to be the worst hit compared to other blockchains like Ethereum and Polygon, which have long been in the NFT market and enjoy wider applications.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to the DaapRadar report, the number of unique active wallets (UAW) rose from 696 in February to 79,261 in May. However, the upswing did not last long, with the current figure at 6,708 in mid-August.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Is Bitcoin Ordinals Dead?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, the sharp decline in sales volume and transactions could indicate a waning interest in Bitcoin Ordinals and also poses a question about its sustainability in the NFT sector.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Notably, the performance within a short period has led to speculations that Bitcoin Ordinals are dead, with some community members stating that the early hype around them was too big for it to last long.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, some remain bullish and believe it is <a href="https://twitter.com/John_4P3/status/1691313193274978304?t=A8YrCSziblo7oisJZ6cAcw&amp;s=19" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">too early</a> to call Bitcoin Ordinals a failure, stating that the project is still in its early stages. Some others, meanwhile, <a href="https://twitter.com/TimHaldorsson/status/1691067832832831488?t=4ZeJ3SoTruobGX2Ihyk90g&amp;s=19" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">argue</a> that Bitcoin and Ethereum are two different blockchains that have different missions and functions, adding that Bitcoin is better off remaining a store of value while Ethereum runs the digital economy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in July <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/vitalik-buterin-lauds-bitcoin-ordinals-believes-brc-20-standard-could-revive-stagnancy/" data-wpel-link="internal">praised</a> Bitcoin Ordinals, saying that it helped to bring back the &#8220;culture of actually doing things&#8221; on the network.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Crypto miners are experimenting with high-performance computing, which may be more profitable than mining itself.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As crypto mining firms rapidly expand infrastructure ahead of the 2024 Bitcoin halving, the industry is also branching out into another growing tech frenzy: artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>A report from JP Morgan on Thursday explained how mining businesses are now repurposing their infrastructure to provide high-performance computing services.</p>
<h2>Miners Pivot to AI</h2>
<p>As led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, the analysts wrote that miners are partly funding their <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/mining-2-0-crypto-miners-embrace-artificial-intelligence-ai-as-the-new-frontier/" data-wpel-link="internal">shift to AI</a> by selling BTC netted from their mining business.</p>
<p>One miner making the transition is Texas-based firm Applied Digital, which has signed a $460 million deal to host cloud computing in its data center. “As the AI industry continues to grow at unprecedented levels, we continue to see extraordinary demand for our new cloud service as a result,” wrote the company in a press release surrounding the deal in June.</p>
<p>British Columbia-based miner Iris Energy has also <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-miner-iris-energy-expanding-capacity-in-pivot-to-ai/" data-wpel-link="internal">revived plans</a> to host HPC services, given its access to cheap renewable energy and large data center capacity. “Recent discussions with market participants have further validated this previous work and that the time may be right to expand into this sector, utilizing Iris Energy’s four existing operating sites,” the firm said in June.</p>
<p>Yet it isn’t just Bitcoin miners: former Ethereum miners left stranded after the network’s merge upgrade in September may now have a new purpose in the sector.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;With the rapid growth of AI, the increased demand for HPC is now opening a new and perhaps more profitable avenue for utilizing GPUs previously used for Ethereum mining,&#8221; JP Morgan said.</p></blockquote>
<h2>More Profitable Than Mining?</h2>
<p>The analysts claim that several miners have already conducted beta tests for offering HPC services using small portions of their computer fleet. At present, each machine appears to be far more profitable per unit of power consumption than it would otherwise be from mining BTC.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If the profitability reported in beta tests is able to be repeated in a large scale it would overshadow in the future the revenues coming from bitcoin mining at the moment,&#8221; analysts added.</p></blockquote>
<p>Miners aren’t only diversifying by industry, but by geography: analysts say the industry is moving into Russia, where there has been a massive energy surplus since the nation’s war with Ukraine began.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Coupled with a colder climate, Russia is thus able to offer significantly cheaper energy resources to bitcoin miners,&#8221; they said.</p></blockquote>
