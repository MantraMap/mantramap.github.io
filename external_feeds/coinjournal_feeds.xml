<li>Donald Trump collection has enjoyed a highly successful launch</li>
<li>Problems with the NFTs are many, however, with suspicious activity behind the scenes</li>
<li>The collection sums up a lot of the bubble-driven noise that has collapsed I the space this year</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>There is nothing worse than when an otherwise-riveting movie wraps up via an underwhelming ending. You leave the cinema feeling cheated, a sour taste lingering in your mouth.</p>
<p>As far as <a href="https://coinjournal.net/cryptocurrencies/">cryptocurrency</a> goes, the year 2022 looks like it is getting the perfect ending. This has not been a happy movie, it should be said. Markets have cratered this year, scandals have been aplenty and the phrase &ldquo;Chapter 11&rdquo; has become uncomfortably commonplace.</p>
<p>And now we are closing it off with a Donald Trump NFT collection catching mainstream media attention. The collection has surpassed 7,000 <a href="https://coinjournal.net/ethereum/what-is-ethereum/">ETH</a> in volume &ndash; that is a cool $8.5 million at time of writing. Floor price for the collection started below $100 but is now close to $400.</p>
<h2><strong>What are Donald Trump&rsquo;s NFTs?</strong></h2>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s collection dropped this month, 45,000 collectibles which look like sports trading cards. They feature the former President in all kinds of variant stances, such as standing in front of Mout Rushmore with Trump&rsquo;s face added on, or holding a rifle in military gear with a dog by his side .</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2022/11/21/1671622700048-ab0cf443-0969-41ac-ba10-3973432f0734.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="354"></p>
<p>But the apparent success of the project has led many to dig further into the project, with some funny results popping up. Twitter user @NFTherder noticed that a suspicious amount of the rarest NFTs in the collection were hoarded by a creator wallet.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/ Turns out Donald Trump minted a thousand of his own nfts to his vault wallet </p>
<p>Keeping a giant portion of the most rare nfts in his collection for himself</p>
<p>The 2nd minted nft was a rare 1-of-1, the chances &hellip; <a href="https://t.co/3m0MQGQydp">pic.twitter.com/3m0MQGQydp</a></p>
<p>&mdash; OKHotshot (@NFTherder) <a href="https://twitter.com/NFTherder/status/1604099659382784000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This &ldquo;Donald Trump Admin&rdquo; wallet holds 1,000 NFTs in the collection, despite a &ldquo;strict limit of 100 Trump Digital Trading Cards per purchaser/household&rdquo;. So not only are they breaking their own rule, but they have claimed some of the most expensive and coveted cards in the collection. The 1000 NFTs are also being held I the wallet that is receiving the royalties from secondary sales of NFTs o the market.</p>
<p>It gets a little more tragic, but far more amusing. People quickly realised that there were watermarks left on several of the images, betraying a lazy reliance on stock imagery. At first glance, the below NFT, #29355, seems like any other.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2022/11/21/1671622722357-9d5a7847-b42f-45a4-aebb-577be885b3d3.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="598"></p>
<p>But if you look closely next to Trump&rsquo;s left ear, an &ldquo;Adobe&rdquo; watermark is clearly visible. That&rsquo;s good stuff.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2022/11/21/1671622691547-a3dea2f4-933c-49b4-989c-dd03285da8bf.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="482"></p>
<p>It was far from the only one, too.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Someone found one of the NFTs still had a watermark from shutterstock on one of the Trump NFTs <a href="https://t.co/wmvAPhaRP2">pic.twitter.com/wmvAPhaRP2</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Morgan (@Helloimmorgan) <a href="https://twitter.com/Helloimmorgan/status/1604241174423822338?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>There are other irregularities here, too. But I think I&rsquo;ve made my point.</p>
<p>In a year that has seen NFT volume crater by over 90%, the entire industry has taken a massive step back after its explosive arrival on the scene during the pandemic. The Bored Ape Yacht Club (which I have <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/bored-ape-1-club-makes-me-sad-i-quit-my-trad-fi-job/">written about before</a>) has seen its floor price fall down to below $100,000 &ndash; seen as the flagship collection by most, it signals the trouble in the wider space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2022/11/21/1671622691424-3c7fba02-0bca-466f-9fc7-ad1180f59ce0.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="339"></p>
<h2><strong>Space cleans out the noise</strong></h2>
<p>In a way, the Trump drop is a nostalgic throwback to the crypto bubble, when speculative gambles like this were everywhere you looked. But really, this is a reminder that so much in the space remains nothing but noise, a lurch for quick money by opportunistic creators.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a torrid year for risk assets overall, but crypto has been ravaged like nowhere else. On the flipside, it is also the industry that saw the most amount of bubble behaviour, with 1000X screenshots all over Twitter, NFTs exchanging hands for hundreds of thousands of dollars and a complete lack of risk management across the board. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Closing the year out with this Trump NFT collection may not rival Lionel Messi&rsquo;s spectacular World Cup swansong, but in a way, it is exactly what 2022 deserves.</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Binance Coin price has dropped sharply in the past few days.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Binance has continued to experience significant outflows.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Binance Coin price has come under intense pressure in the past few weeks amid rising concerns about the ecosystem. BNB has plunged by more than 37% from the highest level on November 9. The current price was close to the lowest level since July.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Binance outflows continues</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/binance-coin/"><u>Binance Coin</u></a> is the cryptocurrency that powers the Binance ecosystem. The BNB Smart Chain is an Ethereum rival that makes it possible for developers to build and deploy applications in all industries like decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFT). It is also a leading player in the gaming industry.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Binance holds most of the BNB coin. However, it is worth noting that the coin is significantly different from FTX Token, which was used primarily for providing incentives to users in FTX&rsquo;s ecosystem. BNB has utility in that it is widely used to run some of the biggest parts of the BNB ecosystem.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Binance Coin price has dropped because of the ongoing outflows in Binance. According to DeFi Llama, Binance has seen outflows worth over $9.25 billion in the past 30 days. Outflows rose to $1.6 billion in the past 7 days and $260 million in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p dir="ltr">These outflows are mostly because of the mountain of red flags that I wrote about&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/binance-coin-price-prediction-a-mountain-of-red-flags/"><u>here</u></a><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>These red flags include the fact that Binance does not have a global headquarter. Instead, the company uses a decentralized model, which is a bit risky.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Further, the company does not have a quality auditor. Its recent financial results were audited by the South African branch of Mazars. For a company the size of Binance, you would expect it to be audited by a big 4 company. During the weekend, Mazars said that it will end its crypto work. As a result, there are increased worries that the company could implode.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Binance Coin price forecast</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2022/11/21/1671622045128-6caa245b-2822-4b24-8966-e8abe17bccca.png" style="width: 607px;height: 301.477px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="607" height="301.477"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BNBUSD/?exchange=BINANCE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BNB chart by TradingView</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">The daily chart shows that the BNB price has been in a strong bearish trend in the past few days. In this period, it moved below the important level of $250 and then retested it today. It also moved below the 25-day and 50-day moving averages.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The coin has also formed a head and shoulders pattern, which is a bearish sign. Therefore, the Binance Coin will likely continue falling as sellers attempt to move below the important support level at $200. A move above the resistance point at $270 will invalidate the bearish view.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Algorand has produced a scalable platform since it was launched in 2019, the CEO said.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Algorand is working hard to deliver the tech without unnecessary effort, hype and speculation.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The company wants to forge ahead with institutional partnerships.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Algorand has always focused on delivering the tech</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Algorand Interim CEO Sean Ford, told Cryptoslate in a recent interview, that the blockchain project has always focused on delivering the tech. He added that Algorand has never focused on unnecessary hype and instead delivers on its technology.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/algorand/what-is-algorand/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Algorand is a public blockchain network</u></a> that was created by MIT professor Silvio Micali and has been around since 2017. Ford highlighted that credibility is important for the crypto space to move forward following the LUNA and FTX crashes that occurred earlier this year. He said;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;Keeping our promises is one of the major ways that web3 could regain credibility. Algorand, unlike many other projects, has always made this a priority &mdash; working hard to deliver the tech without unnecessary effort hype and speculation. Since its launch in 2019, Algorand has produced a scalable platform that provides security, fast finality, and (as Sean emphatically emphasizes), &ldquo;zero downtime.&rdquo;</em></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Algorand to focus on institutional partnerships</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Algorand has entered some very important partnerships this year, including one with FIFA, the official governing body of football. Algorand became the official blockchain platform of FIFA following and&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/should-you-buy-algorand-ahead-of-the-world-cup-amid-a-sponsorship-deal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>sponsorship and technical partnership deal</u></a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As FIFA&rsquo;s official blockchain partner, Algorand has launched a marketplace for collectibles tied to FIFA&rsquo;s digital archives. Algorand&rsquo;s interim CEO explained that</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;There are many ways the partnership could evolve, from issuing bonds to creating composable tickets that &ldquo;take on a life of their own. The first step on its innovation journey is to start embracing new technology and drive benefits to engage more closely with fans.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Moving forward, Ford said Algorand would focus on establishing institutional relationships. He said;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;Traditional financial institutions have been more thoughtful and rigorous about understanding the technology and the benefits and pressure-testing the capabilities of technical partners. They are more rigorous because they have a fiduciary responsibility, and there are things they can&rsquo;t accept like downtime, lack of security, or lack of finality.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Ford concluded that despite the slow rate of adoption, the presence of institutional entities in the crypto market is inevitable. He said;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen a big pullback if you consider adopting new infrastructure &mdash; at least in our world. Our partners worldwide, like Koibanx in Latin America, are working with dozens of financial institutions and banks to adopt blockchain and Algorand and leverage it for their infrastructure. They&rsquo;re very active even in this climate.&rdquo;</em></p>

<h2 dir="ltr">What is Apecoin (APE)?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">In the spring of 2022, Bored Ape Yacht Club released a utility and governance token for the APE ecosystem, Apecoin (APE). Holders of APE tokens not only have exclusive access to merch, games, services, and events but also have a say in what partnerships and programmes the Ape Foundation will support. In addition, third-party developers can also reward their participants with APE tokens.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Can APE compete with MCADE in the future?</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What is Metacade (MCADE)?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://metacade.co/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=launch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Metacade</u></a> is a virtual gathering spot and community hub that&rsquo;s set to be home to the latest, greatest GameFi and P2E games, similar to the way Steam operates for PC games. With so many different titles in the works, there will be something for everyone to enjoy in the Metacade. That&rsquo;s part of what makes the project so promising.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another reason for the optimism surrounding Metacade is its commitment to the community. It serves the community by offering many avenues for earning income online, such as P2E games, staking, prize draws, and even competitive tournaments.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Plus, <a href="https://metacade.co/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=launch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Metacade</u></a> will give out funding via Metagrants to aspiring developers from the community with big ideas. The community will vote on who receives these grants to give users more of a say over what Metacade looks like moving forward. This will also help to ensure that there are always fun, new games to try on the platform with a valuable reason to keep coming back.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Metacade will be more successful than Apecoin &ndash; Here&rsquo;s why</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Now that we&rsquo;ve covered what Metacade is let&rsquo;s look at why the price prediction for it is higher than our Apecoin price prediction. Here are four factors to consider while you evaluate your Apecoin price prediction moving forward.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Metacade Offers Something for Everyone</h3>
<p dir="ltr">What makes Metacade special is its inclusion of many different Web3 gaming titles on one platform. Most projects only offer a single game for users to play. This means that if someone doesn&rsquo;t enjoy that game, they have no reason to continue engaging with the platform.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Metacade&rsquo;s increasing library of titles gives users an ever-expanding list of reasons to engage with the platform. This helps keep user levels high and ensures long-term growth.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Apecoin Has Limited Appeal</h3>
<p dir="ltr">One thing to consider when making your Apecoin price prediction is that the project is an extension of the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection. This NFT collection is one of the most popular on the market but also one of the most widely ridiculed in the crypto community.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Many crypto enthusiasts dislike Bored Ape Yacht Club and its holders. These people are unlikely to ever engage with Apecoin which could hold the project back in 2023 and beyond.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Metacade is For More Than Just Gaming</h3>
<p dir="ltr">As a platform, Metacade does more than just give people access to the best games. It&rsquo;s also a socially active place where friends can spend time together and meet new people. Individuals who wish to work in Web3 could one day find their first jobs, doing things like testing games and managing communities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In this sense, Metacade has the scope to become like a virtual community square or town hall, providing an important social space for the future of the metaverse. Its potential goes beyond the gaming sector.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Apecoin Is Dependent on Too Much Going the Right Way</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.yuga.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Apecoin</u></a> will serve as the native currency of Yuga Labs&rsquo; upcoming Otherside metaverse world project. That&rsquo;s why Apecoin has managed to hold a relatively high market cap.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, if anything goes wrong with Otherside &ndash; such as not having many users at launch or experiencing delays &ndash; then Apecoin will suffer. The same is true of the Bored Ape Yacht Club ecosystem in general.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This means that Apecoin is too dependent on other projects to succeed on its own. It&rsquo;s important to remember this while making an Apecoin price prediction.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Metacade (MCADE) seems to be the better investment opportunity</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Given everything this article has covered, it should be easier to see why the Apecoin price prediction is lower than the prediction for MCADE. Metacade offers a vast range of utilities across its platform and a potentially massive combined target audience from an exploding gaming sector. A platform with a variety of gaming experiences is much more likely to capture and successfully retain users at a significantly higher rate than a single-title experience.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The project&rsquo;s presale pricing began at 125 MCADE for $1 and will gradually increase in price to 50 MCADE for $1 by the time it ends. Metacade and its MCADE token stand to become one of the very best investments of 2023 and beyond. Potential investors should get into it before the hordes descend. The earlier a solid investment is made, the greater the potential to profit.</p>

<p dir="ltr">OKCoin&rsquo;s CEO believes that the rising need for sound currency systems could result in the next bull run.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">More countries will follow El Salvador&rsquo;s footsteps and adopt digital currencies, the CEO added.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The next Bitcoin halving in 2024 could also trigger a surge in crypto prices.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Three catalysts could ignite the next bull run</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Okcoin CEO Hong Fang, revealed in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRJDlDOUopY" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>recent interview</u></a>, that he believes three catalysts could trigger the next Bitcoin bull run. He mentioned this while talking to Kitco News earlier this week.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to Fang, the rising need for sound currency systems, caused by the failures of current centralised monetary systems, could serve as a catalyst for the next crypto bull market.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He added that he envisions a scenario where more countries will follow El Salvador&rsquo;s footsteps and make Bitcoin a legal tender. Fang said;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;I think from a macro perspective, we continue to see challenges out there&hellip; I think the World Bank recently came out saying that a dozen countries may default on their own country&rsquo;s debt next year, which is a failure of a centralized monetary system. I would suspect that the fundamental need for a more sound money will continue to build in the background, something like El Salvador, but maybe of a larger size.&rdquo;</em></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Bitcoin halving could trigger the next bull cycle</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">According to Fang, the next&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/halvening-explained-infographic/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Bitcoin halving</u></a> event in 2024 could also trigger a bull cycle. He stated that;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Bitcoin has its own [halving] cycle. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s coincidental that the past crypto cycles have somewhat coincided with the Bitcoin [halving] cycle, but that may also be another catalyst&hellip;I think the third potential catalyst is real projects. Every time we have a bull market with Bitcoin, with DeFi [decentralized finance] and NFTs [non-fungible tokens], that was because a lot of builders, they built projects in the last bear market. So I think that all of the projects that are being built right now, when there is a little more substance that can be felt by the customers that they tend to serve, [it] will trigger another bull market.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The leading cryptocurrency has been underperforming in recent months, with the&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>price of Bitcoin</u></a> now close to the $17k mark.&nbsp;</p>

<li>Poor record keeping is making the unwinding of the collapse FTX exchange difficult.</li>
<li>The new FTX management is trying to trace millions of dollars from several bank accounts.</li>
<li>So far, the new management has identified over $1 billion.</li>
</ul>
<p>FTX&rsquo;s new management, which took over from the founder Sam Bankman-Fried, on Tuesday told a procedural hearing that it has identified assets worth more than $1 billion since it <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/ftx-begins-strategic-review-of-all-company-assets/">started a strategic review of its assets</a>. It also said that it had located about $720 million held by US financial institutions, which it is yet to consolidate.</p>
<p>The US financial institutions were authorized to hold funds by the US Department of Justice and about $500 million are already confirmed held in US institutions.</p>
<p>The new FTX chief financial officer (CFO), Mary Cilia speaking under oath during the bankruptcy hearings said:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We are reaching out to all of those banks and changing the signatories on the accounts so that we can get access to the accounts and move the cash as much as we can to authorized depository institutions.&rdquo;</em></p>
<h2>$423 million held at a single broker</h2>
<p>The CFO also mentioned that about $423 million held by US authorities are from a single broker though she never mentioned the broker by name. Cilia said, &ldquo;$485 million are already in an authorized deposit institution&rdquo;</p>
<p>Besides the funds held in the US, there is about $130 million in cash that is locked up in Japan where local authorities have ring-fenced the funds for local customers.</p>
<p>Steve Coverick, a senior director at FTX&rsquo;s financial advisors Alvarez &amp; Marsal told the hearing that the new management is working to identify FTX&rsquo;s international crypto assets and transfer them to cold wallets using custodial providers like <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/ftx-to-hire-bitgo-to-safeguard-its-assets-during-bankruptcy/">Bitgo, which FTX hired in November</a>.</p>
<h2>Difficulties in winding up FTX</h2>
<p>While the Chapter 11 bankruptcy hearings are supposed to wind up the FTX exchange, there have been complications due to poor record keeping and weak governance under the former CEO, SBF. The new management is being forced to look for details by reviewing customer terms and conditions stored in a variety of places including Slack and Google Drive.</p>
<p>As a result, the exchange is yet to file a statement of its financial position or of its assets as required under the US bankruptcy law. It however estimates it could do so in April next year.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The BNB (BNB/USDT and BNB/USDC) trading pairs are now available on the OKX spot trading platform. This <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>latest cryptocurrency news</u></a> has pushed OKB up by more than 4% in the last 24 hours, making it the best performer amongst the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market cap.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;The broader cryptocurrency market has retreated after a positive start to the week. The total crypto market cap is down by less than 1% and currently stands below $810 billion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin is up by less than 1% but continues to struggle to move past the $17k resistance level.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Key levels to watch</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The OKB/USDT 4-hour chart has turned positive, as OKB has been performing well over the last 24 hours. The technical indicators show that OKB&rsquo;s performance could improve in the near term.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The 14-day RSI of 57 shows that OKB is neutral at the moment but could enter the overbought region if the rally continues. The MACD line just crossed into the positive line, indicating that the bulls have taken control of the OKB market.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At press time, OKB is trading at $22.592. If the bullish trend continues, OKB could surge past the $24.245 resistance level before the end of the day. The positive trend could continue over the next few days and rally toward the $26.5 resistance level.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>WEEX crypto exchange to integrate Alchemy Pay</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">The Alchemy Pay team announced a few hours ago that cryptocurrency exchange WEEX is set to integrate its Fiat Onramp Solution. The integration means that WEEX&rsquo;s users can pay with their preferred fiat payment methods directly to buy cryptocurrencies and fund their accounts.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The broader cryptocurrency market is underperforming after a positive start to the week. The total crypto market cap is down by less than 1% and currently stands below $810 billion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin, the world&rsquo;s leading cryptocurrency by market cap, is still trading in the positive zone. It is up by less than 1%, and the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>price of Bitcoin</u></a> currently stands above $16,800.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Key levels to watch</h2>

<p dir="ltr">The MACD line remains below the neutral zone, indicating that the bears are yet to relinquish control of the ACH market. The 14-day relative strength index of 49 shows that ACH is no longer in the oversold region, and its sentiment has been improving.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If the positive momentum is maintained, ACH could rally past the $0.0080 resistance level before the end of the day.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, it would need the support of the broader crypto market before it can attempt to reach the $0.0102 psychological level in the near term.</p>

<li>The Lima upgrade is the 12<sup>th</sup> upgrade on the Tezos protocol.</li>
<li>Tezos is referred to as the &ldquo;self-amending blockchain&rdquo; for its ability to seamlessly upgrade using its on-chain governance.</li>
<li>Lima upgrade reduces the risk of bugs in smart contracts among other benefits.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://coinjournal.net/tezos/what-is-tezos/">Tezos</a>, one of the original <a href="https://coinjournal.net/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos/">Proof-of-Stake (PoS)</a> blockchains, has activated its 12<sup>th</sup> upgrade, the Lima upgrade, which was voted upon and approved by the Tezos community. The new upgrade which introduces several new features also reduces the risk of bugs in smart contracts.</p>
<p>Lima marks the fourth protocol upgrade in 2022 and the 12<sup>th</sup> upgrade since the Tezos protocol was unveiled. Tezos is known for its ability to seamlessly upgrade through its on-chain governances which allows the protocol participants to propose and vote on upgrades and changes that they believe are important for the protocol.</p>
<h2>Key improvements introduced by Lima upgrade</h2>
<p>The Lima upgrade introduces several key improvements to Tezos functionality including faster processing speeds, the introduction of consensus keys, and improvements to tickets.</p>
<p>The Lima upgrade continues with the &lsquo;Pipelining validation project&rsquo; that speeds up the processing of blocks and operations on Tezos by separating validation processes from application processes. A new block on Tezos is first validated before being forwarded to other peers; a feature that speeds up block propagation on the network and reduces the block time to 15 seconds and increases the overall throughput for the blockchain.</p>
<p>The consensus keys will allow validators (known as bakers in Tezos) to designate a special key for signing blocks and consensus operations. This feature prevents backers from losing delegators due to a change in setup or the need to coordinate with delegators <a href="https://coinjournal.net/glossary/off-chain/">off-chain</a> to move them to a new address.</p>
<p>Tickets are a type of data unique to Tezos smart contracts and a great foundation for the scalable solutions that have allowed for many use cases including tokenization, authentication, and voting among others. Lima upgrade in particular deprecates the creation, storage and transfer of zero-amount tickets thus reducing the risk of bugs in smart contracts.</p>
<p>In addition to the improvements to the current Layer 1 Tezos solutions, the Lima upgrade also finalizes the development work towards Smart Rollups, which is an innovative Layer 2 scaling solution that is expected to debut in the subsequent Tezos upgrade proposal.</p>
