<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has agreed with crypto hedge fund EmpiresX.</em></li>



<li><em>A fine of nearly $35 million will be used to compensate victims of the scam.</em></li>



<li><em>In June last year, the SEC announced fraud charges against EmpiresX and its co-founders.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The bankrupt EmpiresX digital asset hedge fund has agreed to pay $34,839,951 in fines to the US SEC in compensation for allegations of investor fraud and violations of Securities laws.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1196.png"><img decoding="async" width="900" height="600" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1196.png" alt="Ponzi Project EmpiresX Pays Nearly $35 Million In Fines To The US SEC" class="wp-image-189414" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1196.png 900w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1196-300x200.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1196-768x512.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1196-750x500.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" title="Ponzi Project EmpiresX Pays Nearly $35 Million In Fines To The US SEC 2"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The settlement, which was agreed on Friday only with the corporate entity EmpiresX, imposes a payment of $32,178,397, representing profits derived from the scheme. An additional $2,661,554 in interest brings the total to $34,849,951. EmpiresX is also permanently barred from violating future securities of the type described in the SEC complaint and from buying, offering, or selling any future securities.</p>



<p>The court had issued a final judgment against co-defendant Nicholas on April 19, fined the trader $300,000, and barred him from attracting any new investors, receiving additional funds from other existing investors, and issuing, buying, offering, or selling any securities.</p>



<p>Last June, the SEC announced fraud charges against EmpiresX, co-founders Emerson Sousa Pires and Flavio Mendes Goncalves, and principal trader Joshua David Nicholas. The defendants are accused of enticing investors with false claims of one percent daily returns but instead embezzling large sums of investors&#8217; money for personal use.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1199.png"><img decoding="async" width="1045" height="601" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1199.png" alt="Ponzi Project EmpiresX Pays Nearly $35 Million In Fines To The US SEC" class="wp-image-189419" title="Ponzi Project EmpiresX Pays Nearly $35 Million In Fines To The US SEC 3"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>EmpiresX, or Empires Consulting Corp, is a Florida-based digital asset hedge fund run by the co-founders Pires and Goncalves and the platform&#8217;s principal trader Nicholas. Joshua David Nicholas <a href="https://news.coincu.com/123596-head-trader-of-empiresx-admits-fraud-scheme/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was reportedly given</a> a 4 year, 3 month prison term in December of last year for committing a $100 million bitcoin scam.</p>



<p>However, from September 2020 to early 2022, the company operated as a Ponzi scheme that the US Department of Justice (DOJ) claims has raised around $100 million with false promises &#8211; legend of a trading bot that uses artificial intelligence to maximize returns for investors.</p>



<p>Instead, in a classic Ponzi scheme, EmpiresX pays earlier investors with the proceeds from later investors. The scheme was revealed in early 2022 after the platform refused to process customer withdrawals during the migration caused by the spring market downturn.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Sorare must temporarily modify its products to conform with the current interpretation of existing French regulations.</em></li>



<li><em>Since it is particular to regulatory negotiations with the ANJ in France, this temporary alternate entry option is only accessible in France.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Sorare, a web3 fantasy sports company, is <a href="https://medium.com/sorare/sorare-product-roadmap-update-95aea80c0712" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proposing</a> an additional entrance option for participants living in France in order to comply with the country&#8217;s planned legislative framework for non-fungible tokens (NFTs).</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1194.png"><img decoding="async" width="1920" height="1080" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1194.png" alt="Sorare Adjusted To Match The French Legal Framework" class="wp-image-189407" title="Web3 Gaming Company Sorare Adjusted To Match The French Legal Framework 6"></a></figure></div>


<p>The French government has announced intentions to draft a law establishing a new legislative framework for &#8220;Exchangeable In-Game Items.&#8221; The emergence of a new framework that properly realizes Web3&#8217;s promise will be critical to its development and success.</p>



<p>Sorare&#8217;s products must be temporarily modified to conform with the current interpretation of existing regulations. Prior to the implementation of the new framework in France, it has agreed to a temporary solution with the French National Gaming Authority (ANJ) that offers an optional alternate mode of entrance for users headquartered only in France.</p>



<p>The Web3 gaming company said in a blog post that the solution is just temporary as they establish their long-term vision in the midst of current regulatory disputes. The interim solution is presently available for its main category, Sorare: Football, and will be extended to Sorare: MLB on May 26, 2023, and Sorare: NBA in the autumn.</p>



<p>Web3 company on the basis of compliance with the applicable laws of the country and insists the platform is not gambling.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;In the meantime, our position remains unchanged: Sorare has nothing to do with the games of chance regulated by the gambling authorities,&#8221; the company said in a blog post.</p>
</blockquote>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1193.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="571" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1193.png" alt="Sorare Adjusted To Match The French Legal Framework" class="wp-image-189406" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1193.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1193-300x167.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1193-768x428.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1193-750x418.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Web3 Gaming Company Sorare Adjusted To Match The French Legal Framework 7"></a></figure></div>


<p>Although the new entrance method will still enable French gamers to access Sorare, it comes with a set of limitations that affect gameplay. In France, players may get access to the game by providing a phone number and evidence of residency.</p>



<p>Following this, they will no longer be able to compete with the NFT versions of digital cards that have unique rarity attributes but will instead have lineups made up of non-blockchain versions of cards that have comparable qualities to Sorare&#8217;s NFT-based cards.</p>

<p>According to the introduction, WaaS uses the most advanced multi-party computing (MPC) technology to secure customers&#8217; private keys. Both key generation and message signing use MPC to enable the maximum security properties of these decentralized algorithms. Customers using the MPC wallet solution can create, access, and recover their wallets with just a username and password.</p>



<p>The product enables various Web3 interactions through APIs and SDKs. Coinbase Payments SDK facilitates the purchase of a wide range of digital assets. The exchange said the secondary Coinbase API facilitates businesses&#8217; ability to integrate crypto-based payments, including DeFi solutions. Wallet as a Service users can remove their private keys from the exchange anytime.</p>

<p>Coinbase seems to be still working on developing new products and expanding its scale to countries outside the US amid an intense legal battle with the SEC.</p>



<p>In the latest retaliatory action, the exchange has filed a mandatory petition in response to what the exchange has said is the SEC&#8217;s refusal to provide more specificity on digital asset regulation.</p>



<p>Coinbase previously announced plans to open a derivatives exchange in Bermuda, and this week this exchange also revealed an expansion in Singapore. The crypto exchange has expanded its Coinbase One subscription service to the UK, Germany, and Ireland and aims to expand its international reach in 35 countries.</p>

<p><a href="https://news.coincu.com/189137-coinbase-deletion-7-trading-pairs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a> has filed an answer in support of a US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) petition in its latest move to seek a rule from the SEC for digital assets. Coinbase&#8217;s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, called the mandamus &#8220;a fitting remedy for extraordinary truths.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Late last night Coinbase replied in the Third Circuit to the SEC’s arguments against our petition for a writ of mandamus. Mandamus is the tailor-made remedy for the extraordinary facts presented here. We continue to appreciate the Court&#39;s consideration. <a href="https://t.co/OD02kX3524" target="_blank">https://t.co/OD02kX3524</a></p>&mdash; paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) <a href="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1661025095173947393?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 23, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Coinbase filings on May 22 stated that the agency decided to deny the exchange&#8217;s July lawsuit but has not made that decision public.</p>



<p>Last month, Coinbase filed a lawsuit against the SEC, asking the SEC to respond to a lawsuit it filed in July 2022 to create specific rules for digital assets. Earlier this month, a US court ordered the SEC to respond to a cryptocurrency rule petition filed by Coinbase within ten days.</p>



<p>At the heart of the dispute is the longstanding debate over which digital assets should be considered secure and, therefore, subject to the SEC&#8217;s trading rules. The regulator told the court earlier this month that the exchange&#8217;s most recent legal action was &#8220;baseless&#8221; and that they still have more time to consider the original claim.</p>

<p>In the latest filing, Coinbase reiterated its argument that the SEC decided to deny its request for the new rules and pointed to public comments from SEC Chairman Gary Gensler.</p>



<p>The largest US cryptocurrency exchange also argued that the SEC&#8217;s enforcement actions showed that it did not consider the lawsuit and accused the regulator of ignoring other cases from the crypto industry for many years.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;The SEC does not dispute that since 2017 it has received five digital-asset-related rulemaking petitions and has acted on none.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It is reported that the court order requires government officials to &#8220;correctly carry out official duties or remedy abuses of power.&#8221;</p>

<p>Syntropy Announces New Web3 Products at Aptos Hack Amsterdam. The protocol is changing the public internet into a safe and user-centric internet by including a unifying layer with built-in encryption and optimal speed that automatically allows anything linked to it.</p>



<p>The fund&#8217;s only purpose is to develop a game-changing Web3 product. It hopes to change that by working with important industry leaders to accomplish a common goal: to make Web3 mainstream for both developers and users.</p>



<p>The program targeted media monitoring for the goal of transparency and accountability in its previous $5 million funding round.</p>



<p>Syntropy aims to make significant development in the next year due to the support of its investors and the cash raised for the project. In line with this, it will develop a new website. It will also include a strategy describing the company&#8217;s future growth goals and objectives.</p>



<p>Syntropy is an open initiative that provides next-generation Internet connection technologies. It is intended to address concerns that currently exist in the Internet architecture, such as security, privacy, governance, performance, dependability, and inefficient resource consumption.</p>



<p>Additionally, Syntropy strives to address many of the inefficiencies and impracticalities that exist in today&#8217;s internet. As a result, it bridges the gap between Web2 and Web3, allowing for the smooth flow of data and applications while also promoting new business models and technological developments.</p>



<p>Moreover, Syntropy enables users to create encrypted connections without the need for complicated configurations or virtual private networks (VPNs). This simplifies the development, scalability, and monitoring of applications. Moreover, the network lowers latency to give the greatest possible performance for easily securing and distributing applications. It employs the consensus process known as Nomination Proof-of-Stake (NPoS). Validators may be nominated to participate in consensus using this approach.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The Layer-1 blockchain Manta Network running has partnered with the rollup-based scaling solution Linea to launch a privacy-centric soulbound token (zkSBT).</em></li>



<li><em>Starting today, users will be able to mint new zkSBT through Manta Network’s NPO platform.</em></li>



<li><em>These zkSBTs will provide users with a decentralized, trustless, and private means for validating their true identity and preventing any information or data leakage linked to their on-chain conduct.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Manta Network, a Layer-1 blockchain built on Polkadot, has teamed with Linea, a rollup-based scaling solution, to introduce a privacy-focused soul-bound coin (zkSBT).</strong></h5>

<p>Users may now create new zkSBT using Manta Network&#8217;s NFT Private Offerings (NPO) platform as long as they complete one of two Linea NFT campaigns.</p>

<p>Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, was the first to propose Souldbound Tokens. They work similarly to NFTs, except that they cannot be exchanged and are linked to the identification of a person or organization. These might be used for medical records or certifications as well.</p>



<p>These zkSBTs will provide users with a decentralized, trustless, and private mechanism to authenticate their true identities while preventing any information or data leakage regarding their on-chain behavior.</p>



<p>The revolutionary tokens will employ Linea&#8217;s zkPioneer, as well as a unique Manta invention called Proof Key, to allow any Web2 or Web3 application to validate a user&#8217;s information without connecting to a wallet.</p>



<p>Manta Network is a layer 1 blockchain built on Polkadot&#8217;s Substrate framework. Manta Network&#8217;s vision is to create a privacy smart contract platform, to achieve that, the project uses zk-SNARK to provide anonymity, high throughput, and cross-chain interoperability.</p>



<p>Currently, Manta Network is the only anonymous DeFi product that is compatible with all asset classes, including stablecoins, and provides security using cryptography instead of hardware.</p>



<p>Compared to public blockchains that also adopt Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) technology like Findora, Manta Network can support multiple cross-chain assets in Polkadot&#8217;s ecosystem. At the same time, Manta Network also reduces repetitive work in the evolution of Polkadot&#8217;s consensus layer ecology.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>According to an OFAC statement, a swath of Binance crypto-holding wallets was sanctioned for possible connections to the North Korean government.</em></li>



<li><em>The exchange&#8217;s wallets received more than $2 million in cryptocurrency.</em></li>



<li><em>The money was subsequently transferred to North Korean companies.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Binance wallets with links to North Korea have been sanctioned, according to a <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1498" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a> from the US Treasury&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Meanwhile, on Tuesday, US agents raided a slew of wallets for possible ties to the North Korean regime.</strong></h5>

<p>OFAC said that the banned wallets, which included Bitcoin, Ether, Tether&#8217;s USDT, and Circle&#8217;s USDC, belonged to a 58-year-old North Korean citizen called Sang Man Kim. Binance, a cryptocurrency exchange, housed the wallets.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s not to claim Binance actively controlled the wallets; they seem to be automatically-generated wallet addresses maintained by the exchange and available to any user. According to blockchain statistics, there have been no transactions to or from these addresses in the last year.</p>



<p>Brian E. Nelson, Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorist and Financial Intelligence, stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“The United States and our partners remain committed to combatting the DPRK’s illicit revenue generation activities and continued efforts to steal money from financial institutions, virtual currency exchanges, companies, and private individuals around the world.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to the OFAC, the Binance wallets received more than $2 million in cryptocurrency. After that, the monies were transferred to North Korean companies, resulting in the sanctions.</p>



<p>The sanctions were coordinated with the Republic of Korea, which named two of the sanctioned parties jointly. South Korea had sanctioned three of the organizations in February.</p>

<p>Pyongyang University of Automation is one of the sanctioned institutions in charge of teaching personnel who go on to serve the DPRK&#8217;s principal intelligence agency, the Reconnaissance General Bureau. </p>



<p>The Treasury Department&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control has also designated two more RGB-controlled operation centers to lead offensive cyber activities. The facilities were linked to the Lazarus Group, a hacking outfit sanctioned by OFAC and renowned for stealing $620 million in virtual currency from a blockchain project in 2022.</p>



<p>North Korea&#8217;s use of illicit cyber activities to escape international sanctions, including cryptocurrency heists, has become a rising threat for US national security.</p>

<p>According to three unidentified individuals quoted in a <em>Reuters</em> article on Tuesday, Binance, the world&#8217;s biggest cryptocurrency exchange, has been accused of mingling customer cash with its own business earnings in breach of US financial rules. This breach is said to have happened in 2020 and 2021.</p>



<p>According to <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/crypto-binance-money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reuters</a></em>, one of the sources said that the combined funds were billions of dollars. According to the insider, the commingling occurred practically daily in Binance&#8217;s accounts at Silvergate Bank, a crypto-focused bank that shut down operations after a collapse in March.</p>



<p>&#8220;Commingling,&#8221; or the mixing of client and corporate assets, has become a kind of a feared buzz term in the cryptosphere since reports after the demise of exchange giant FTX in November last year raised suspicions that the practice was widespread.</p>



<p>According to the investigation, money from customers was sent to the Silvergate account of Key Vision Development, a Seychelles-based firm controlled by Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance. The exchange apparently advised Silvergate that the main objective of the Key Vision account was to accept USD payments from non-US consumers.</p>



<p>It was also claimed that a second Silvergate-based account connected to the Binance CEO&#8217;s Cayman corporation was used to convert funds into the dollar-linked coin Binance USD. But, according to the <em>Reuters</em> story, there was no proof that the exchange&#8217;s customer fund was lost or stolen.</p>



<p>Binance itself has been accused of money mixing after a January Bloomberg story showed that the exchange had retained collateral for some crypto assets it issued in the same wallet as monies belonging to consumers.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, Binance&#8217;s Chief Communications Officer Patrick Hillmann attacked the <em>Reuters</em> article, calling it &#8220;weak&#8221; and full of &#8220;conspiracy theories.&#8221; He said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“The whole base of their story this morning, is that when users purchased BUSD (Paxos) from Binance, they were taken to a transaction page that had the term ‘deposit’ on it. Users were making a purchase of a stablecoin that was redeemable by Paxos, which was explicitly stated on the page.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hillmann later <a href="https://twitter.com/PRHillmann/status/1660987014626287617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">noted</a> that the conversation had addressed the matter &#8220;on multiple occasions.&#8221;</p>



<p>The current flurry of claims against the exchange for violating US banking regulations comes just months after the exchange was sued by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>South Korea’s Ministry of Justice issued an opinion to the Ministry of Justice of Montenegro saying that Terraform Labs CEO Do Kwon should not be released on bail.</em></li>



<li><em>Prosecutors in Montenegro have filed an appeal against Terra co-founder Do Kwon and chief financial officer Han Chang-<em>Joon&#8217;s</em></em> <em>bail conditions.</em></li>



<li><em>Montenegro is not the only nation threatening Kwon.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <a href="https://www.digitalasset.works/news/articleView.html?idxno=2668" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">local news</a>, The South Korean Ministry of Justice advised the Montenegrin Ministry of Justice that &#8220;the bail of Kwon Do-hyung (Do Kwon), CEO of Terraform Labs (TFL), is incorrect.&#8221;</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1176.png"><img decoding="async" width="976" height="549" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1176.png" alt="Do Kwon&#039;s Freedom Is Receiving Intense Criticism" class="wp-image-189338" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1176.png 976w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1176-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1176-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1176-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 976px) 100vw, 976px" title="Do Kwon&#039;s Freedom Is Receiving Intense Criticism 32"></a></figure></div>


<p>On May 23, a Seoul Southern District Prosecutor&#8217;s Office official stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;I know that the Ministry of Justice expressed and conveyed the opinion that &#8216;CEO Kwon&#8217;s bail is inappropriate&#8217; to the Montenegro Ministry of Justice.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Prosecutors in Montenegro have filed an appeal against the bail conditions imposed on Terraform Labs co-founder <a href="https://news.coincu.com/188332-do-kwon-withdraw-2-15-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Do Kwon</a> and chief financial officer Han Chang-Joon.</p>



<p>Kwon urged the Montenegro court on May 11 to release him on bail of 400,000 euros ($436,000) under the condition of home arrest, and the next court agreed.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, Montenegrin prosecutors filed an appeal, noting the low bail amount in comparison to Kwon&#8217;s wealth. It is unknown if bail was posted or an appeal was filed.</p>



<p>Kwon was detained in Podgorica on March 23 on allegations of possessing a falsified passport. Last month, Montenegrin prosecutors charged Kwon and Han with forgery for allegedly using phony passports from Belgium and Costa Rica. Forging papers is punished by up to five years in jail.</p>



<p>According to a prosecution official:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We are working hard to request the extradition of Kwon, and we are closely watching related matters.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Montenegro is not the only nation threatening Kwon, Han, and other Terraform Labs executives with the death penalty (the company behind Terra). Courts in South Korea, Singapore, and the United States are also looking at them. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the United States charged Kwon and others with intentionally dealing unregistered securities.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office in the country&#8217;s capital, Podgorica, also <a href="https://sudovi.me/ospg/sadrzaj/pDQy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed</a> a formal appeal against the court&#8217;s decision to release Kwon and Han on bail on May 12.</p>

<p>The increasing demand for stablecoins in emerging regions with frail financial systems, such as Latin America and Turkey, is driving the growth of the stablecoin market. Stablecoins are commonly used as a means of sending remittances and storing value. They anchor their price to an external asset, usually a government-issued fiat currency, and enable cheaper and faster transactions using blockchain technology. Despite their growing adoption in developing countries, U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins still represent roughly 99% of the combined supply.</p>



<p>Num Finance offers collateralized loans in local currency stablecoins to businesses in emerging markets. Currently, the protocol issues Argentine peso and Peruvian sol stablecoins. With the additional funding, Num Finance will be able to expand its services to more countries and offer more financial services to businesses in emerging markets.</p>
