			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Yield Guild Games surged nearly 600% in less than a week, smashing through the top gainers charts before abruptly crashing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to reports, a new Binance trading product and an ongoing community gaming event have played a pivotal role in the incredible price rally of the YGG token.&nbsp;</p>
YGG Token Surges&nbsp;
<p>According to data from CoinmarketCap, the Yield Guild Games (YGG) token saw a dramatic surge over the past week, rising by 580% and reaching a peak of $0.93 on the 7th of August, 2023. However, the token abruptly crashed soon after reaching this price level and is currently trading at around $0.36. However, the token had hinted at a decline in price in its gradually dropping trading volume. The trading volume recorded a drop of 26% in 24 hours, falling under $500 million, while the market cap increased by $17 million, reaching $161 million.&nbsp;</p>
Why Did The YGG Price Rally?&nbsp;
<p>Observers attributed the surge in the YGG token&rsquo;s price to a couple of major factors. On the 3rd of August, Yield Guild Games announced the 4th season of the Guild Advancement Program (GAP). The Guild Advancement Program is a periodic gaming event that distributes rewards such as tokens to community members who successfully complete specified quests in participating in YGG-affiliated games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 4th season of Yield Guild Games includes some of the biggest names in the space, such as Splinterlands, Skyweaver, and Axie Infinity. As a result, it should come as no surprise that the Yield Guild Games network usage saw a spike, reaching a one-month high of 192 active addresses. Yield Guild Games stated in its press release,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of the community&rsquo;s most recent top picks are joining the fold this season, with all-new quests for guild members to dive into as they hone their skills and establish their web3 reputation. The season will officially begin on the 3rd of August, 2023, and will run until the 27th of September, 2023.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barely a day later, Binance announced plans to launch a YGG/USDT trading pair for perpetual contracts on its CEX platform, allowing up to 20x leverage. Available on-chain data suggests that the announcement brought in about $100 million worth of new capital into the YGG ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
Whales Dumping Share Of YGG
<p>While the growth has been quite notable, reports have emerged of venture capital companies who initially backed the project, reportedly looking to sell their share of YGG on Binance. Data from LookOnChain sourced on the 7th of August shows that Bitkraft Ventures and DWF Labs have moved their YGG holdings to Binance and are most likely looking to sell. DWF Labs had received around 29 million YGG from the Yield Guild Games Treasury. However, on-chain data has suggested that most of these tokens have been moved to exchanges. Bitkraft Ventures also made large deposits on Binance using FalconX.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another whale, Wintermute Trading, has reportedly deposited just over 11 million YGG worth $6.7 million to different exchanges over the past four days. It currently holds a further 2.5 million YGG, valued at around $1.5 million. LookOnChain also showed that Youbi Capital had deposited around 1 million YGG to Binance. The firm currently holds about 11 million YGG. Sfermion has also jumped on board the selling wagon, using FalconX to deposit its YGG tokens on Binance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Large deposits generally signify an investor&rsquo;s willingness to exchange the token for other assets or sell them. This is also true of whales such as the ones mentioned earlier. Smaller investors generally tend to follow larger investors, copying their selling behavior.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Steadefi has become the latest DeFi entity to be hit with an exploit, with the company stating in a tweet on X that all the funds it currently holds are at risk of becoming irrecoverable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recent hacks have taken a toll on the space and have put considerable strain on public trust in DeFi apps.</p>
Details Of The Hack&nbsp;
<p>News of the attack first became public on the 7th of August, when it emerged that the decentralized finance app was hit by an exploit of at least $334,000. While the attack was ongoing, the protocol&rsquo;s development team put out a message on X, stating that the attack had put all funds held on the platform at risk and they could become irrecoverable. As a result, the app&rsquo;s total value locked (TVL) fell off a cliff, according to data from DefiLlama. The team posted a message stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;NOTICE: Steadefi has been exploited, and all funds are currently at risk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The team, while confirming the attack, posted a follow-up message on X and explained how the attack occurred. According to the message, the hacker managed to gain access to the private key of the team&rsquo;s deployer wallet and perform OwnerOnly functions. After gaining access to OwnerOnly functions, the hacker executed several OwnerOnly actions, such as allowing any wallet to borrow funds from lending vaults.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team further stated that the attacker managed to drain all loanable funds. However, it assured users that all collateral held in vaults and not lent out was secure. This is because the app does not contain OwnerOnly functions to remove deposits. This means those users who deposited funds to the app&rsquo;s &ldquo;strategy&rdquo; vaults could withdraw some of their funds.&nbsp;</p>
Farming Contracts Stopped&nbsp;
<p>Meanwhile, the hacker also stopped farming contracts through an OwnerOnly function. This means all users who deposited svTokens or ibTokens to farms are currently unable to withdraw their funds. The post states that the funds are essentially stuck in the app&rsquo;s contracts, with token holders who deposited into the farms left in the lurch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to details currently available, the tokens transferred to the address in question include 130,429 USD Coin, 3.39 BTC, 6184 Avalanche (AVAX), and 15 Wrapped Ether (WETH). Apart from the Wrapped Ether, all other tokens were immediately swapped for WETH. The attacker then bridged 184 WETH to another network via the Synapse Bridge.&nbsp;</p>
Steadefi Attempts To Negotiate With Hackers&nbsp;
<p>The development team also confirmed that it is attempting to negotiate with the hackers and has sent an on-chain message to the hacker&rsquo;s address, 0x9cf71F2ff126B9743319B60d2D873F0E508810dc, on Ethereum. Blockchain data has revealed that the address saw a large number of inflows on the Avalanche Chain. The development team seems to have taken a leaf out of Curve Finance, Metronome, and Alchemix&rsquo;s playbook, offering 10% of the stolen funds as a bounty in return for the remaining 90%. The team also told the hacker that should they return the funds, there would be no involvement of law enforcement agencies or legal actions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Steadefi would like to discuss a bounty with any parties who were involved in the recent Steadefi exploit. We are offering a 10% bounty of any funds stolen, which are yours to keep if you return the remaining 90%.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, like Curve, in a stark warning, the team added that should the hackers refuse the offer, Steadefi would offer the 10% as a bounty to anyone in the public who could identify or supply information that leads to a conviction. Clearly, Steadefi hopes to see the funds return without any further complications. However, the platform is more than willing to fight for the funds should it need to. The offer expires on the 10th of August at 0800 UTC.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will have no risk of us pursuing this further, no risk of law enforcement issues, etc. If you choose not to partake in the voluntary return and complete the process by the 10th of August at 0800 UTC, we will expand the bounty to the public and offer the full 10% to the person who is able to identify you in a way that leads to your conviction in the courts. We will pursue you from all angles with the full extent of the law.&rdquo;</p>

DeFi&rsquo;s Hacker Headache&nbsp;
<p>Crypto and DeFi remain highly vulnerable to bad actors, even as the space looks for wider acceptance. Last month, Coinspaid fell victim to an attack orchestrated by the dreaded Lazarus Group, a North Korean-backed hacker group. An analysis showed how the breach occurred and found multiple vulnerabilities in Coinspaid&rsquo;s security. At the beginning of August, decentralized exchange LeetSwap suspended trading thanks to fears of a potential exploit. Bankrupt crypto platform Voyager also suffered a breach in the middle of its court-supervised recovery process. Another August heist saw a scammer steal around $20 million worth of USDT through a zero transfer phishing attack. However, Tether was quick to respond, freezing the attacker&rsquo;s address and blacklisting them.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Cypher Protocol, a decentralized futures exchange operating on the Solana blockchain, disclosed on August 7th that a significant security breach occurred on their platform.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The breach led to an estimated unauthorized transfer of assets valued at around $1 million. Swiftly addressing the event, Cypher Protocol informed its community of followers on X (formerly Twitter) and took immediate action by freezing its associated smart contract.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">A statement from the firm emphasized their responsive action:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"Cypher has experienced a security incident. The smart contract has been frozen. Investigations are ongoing. The team is currently working with individuals and investigating. To the hacker: We are writing to see whether you would be open to speaking with us about any potential next steps."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Data sourced from the Solana blockchain explorer, Solscan, has been invaluable in providing insights into the breach. It appears that the attacker or attackers absconded with a considerable 38,530 Solana (SOL) tokens in addition to $123,184 USD Coin (USDC). In sum, these unauthorized transactions amounted to roughly $1,035,203. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">What has raised eyebrows in the aftermath of the breach was the movement of the alleged funds. Within a short span following the exploit, a sum of 30,000 USDC from the contentious wallet was rerouted to Binance&rsquo;s specific Solana USDC address. The rapidity of these fund movements highlights the speed at which digital assets can change hands, emphasizing the need for robust security measures and real-time monitoring.</p>
Community Response and Calls for Accountability
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The aftermath of the exploit was punctuated by unique, digital-era responses. Members from the cryptocurrency community sent a series of NFTs to the suspected wallet. These weren&rsquo;t typical assets, but they bore messages &ndash; some of which appealed to the hacker's conscience to return the stolen funds. Among the various messages, one read:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"Seriously though, you used Binance and KuCoin to fund and to try and get 30k out. People will find you. Please do the right thing and give the rest back."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">The timing of this security breach was rather inopportune, as it coincided with Cypher Protocol&rsquo;s collaborative mtnDAO hacker house event, which they co-hosted with another Solana protocol, Marginfi. Ensuring clarity and dispelling doubts about their own security, Marginfi swiftly relayed via their Telegram channel that they remained unaffected by the breach and continue to maintain their operational independence from Cypher.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">As of the time of reporting, no Solana-based funds have been detected as transferred to the Ethereum network, leaving the next steps of the alleged hacker unpredictable.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Incidents like these not only impact the entities directly involved but also reverberate throughout the crypto community. They underscore the persistent challenges in the realm of digital security and emphasize the need for continuous improvements in safeguarding digital assets.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Less than a day after PayPal&rsquo;s huge announcement, Ethereum became flooded by imposter tokens trying to ride the hype.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The digital payments and fintech giant announced the official launch of its very own Ethereum-based stablecoin PayPal USD (PYUSD) yesterday August 7. PYUSD is an ERC-20 token which will be pegged to the US dollar at a fixed rate of $1. It will be primarily used as a bridge between fiat currencies and web3, enabling conversion of any of the platform&rsquo;s listed digital assets to and from PYUSD. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The launch has been the result of PayPal&rsquo;s own exploration into stablecoins at least as far back as January 2022 but which was temporarily halted due to regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. The launch might mean that an agreement has been made between regulators and PayPal&rsquo;s stablecoin issuer Paxos. Now, the launch has been received with much fanfare, with the stablecoin finally rolling out to customers &ldquo;in the coming weeks.&rdquo; </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">However, this has not stopped scammers from riding the hype and launching fake PayPal stablecoins; which have since flooded cryptocurrency exchanges such as Uniswap. This was in part due to PayPal and Paxos&rsquo; own failure to include the official token address for PYUSD in their respective announcements. Users were then quick to inform PayPal about the problem. Finally, after more than a day since the PYUSD announcement, Paxos has released the official smart contract for PYUSD and the corresponding token address and GitHub repository. Currently, the max total supply of PYUSD sits at 26.9 million according to etherscan.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The launch of PayPal&rsquo;s own stablecoin could send waves throughout the crypto industry in the United States. The fact that a stablecoin was released could mean that the current hostile environment for crypto in the country might start to somewhat cool down.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Blockchain.com, one of the earlier players and brands in the crypto exchange space, has secured a payments license from Singapore's regulatory body, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This move follows an in-principle approval granted to the platform in the previous year. With this license, Blockchain.com now joins a group of other service providers in the nation, which includes Circle, DBS Vickers, and Revolut.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">MAS's decision to grant Blockchain.com its license signifies the evolving stance of regulatory bodies towards digital currencies and payment platforms. Licenses from entities like MAS are instrumental in validating a platform's adherence to regional financial and operational norms. For an industry often scrutinized for its transparency and security measures, such endorsements can be critical.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">For platforms like Blockchain.com, having an MAS license can offer a level of operational assurance to its user base. Regulatory frameworks ensure platforms maintain a balance between innovation and user security.</p>
Digital Payments and Regulatory Frameworks
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The ascent of digital payments across the globe underscores the need for robust regulatory mechanisms. Regulatory frameworks aim to standardize operations, ensuring that platforms operate within set boundaries, emphasizing security and transparency. In such a dynamic environment, recognized licenses can be pivotal, guiding platforms through compliant operations.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">With this move, Singapore continues to demonstrate its adaptability in the evolving world of digital payments and cryptocurrencies. Singapore has since emerged as a preferred location for crypto-based startups, ranking third after the US and the UK in terms of funding. Such moves reiterate Singapore's growing position in the global crypto narrative.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">To conclude, Blockchain.com's acquisition of the MAS license is a step forward in its operational journey, while also reflecting Singapore's progressive approach towards digital payment platforms and crypto services.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>PayPal has announced the launch of its native U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin called PayPal USD (PYUSD) based on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
First Global Payments Company to Launch a Stablecoin&nbsp;
<p>On Monday, August 7, digital payments giant PayPal announced the official launch of its Ethereum-based stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. PayPal USD (PYUSD) will become available to the eligible U.S. customers in the upcoming weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ERC-20 stablecoin can be used for transfers between PayPal and supported external wallets, person-to-person payments, funding purchases, and converting any of the platform&rsquo;s listed digital assets to and from PayPal USD.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The shift toward digital currencies requires a stable instrument that is both digitally native and easily connected to fiat currency like the U.S. dollar," commented Dan Schulman, president and CEO, PayPal. "Our commitment to responsible innovation and compliance, and our track record delivering new experiences to our customers, provides the foundation necessary to contribute to the growth of digital payments through PayPal USD."</p>

<p>According to the company&rsquo;s statement, PYUSD will serve as a bridge between fiat and Web3 for consumers and merchants, will be available to external developers, wallets and web3 applications, can be seamlessly adopted by exchanges, and used as a driving force behind many experiences in the PayPal ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issuer of PayPal USD is Paxos Trust Company, a fully licensed New-York based financial institution specializing in blockchain. PYUSD reserves are fully supported by U.S. dollar deposits, U.S. Treasuries and similar cash equivalents. PayPal USD can be bought or sold at a fixed rate $1 per PYUSD via PayPal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting from September 2023, Paxos will be publishing a public monthly Reserve Report for PayPal USD, and a public third-party attestation of the value of PayPal USD reserve assets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In addition to building products and services that add utility to digital currencies, PayPal is focused on increasing consumer and merchant comprehension of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), while working closely with regulators as the industry evolves.&rdquo; reads the PayPal press release.&nbsp;</p>

PayPal Continues Integration of Crypto
<p>PayPal first confirmed its exploration of stablecoins back at the beginning of last year, although in February 2023 it reported to have halted the project due to regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. The release of PYUSD might mean that the company and its stablecoin issuer Paxos have finally reached an agreement with its persecutors.</p>
<p>The prominent fintech company has been actively exploring and integrating crypto services for the last couple of years. PayPal has recently revealed that it&rsquo;s holding almost $1 billion worth of crypto on behalf of its clients.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Records of Trump&rsquo;s and his inner circle&rsquo;s crypto promotions could be used against him in court and the upcoming presidential race.</p>
First US President to Ever Be Indicted
<p>Former US President. Donald J. Trump is the first American leader to ever be indicted. Trump is currently facing numerous charges in connection with at least three criminal cases including hush money payments, mishandling of classified documents, and the January 6 insurrection case, an effort to overturn the 2020 election. The 45th President of the US pleaded not guilty to all of the counts. However, the investigation continues. Trump might also face charges related to the election interference in the state of Georgia in 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for crypto, some suggest that Trump&rsquo;s and his inner circle&rsquo;s involvement in activities related to digital assets could add up to the criminal charges against the former president and decrease his chances of reelection.</p>
Trump Family Jumps into NFT Space
<p>Former first lady, Melania Trump, was the first one to release an NFT collection called &ldquo;Melania&rsquo;s Vision&rdquo;on the Solana blockchain back in 2021. However, Melania Trump was later accused of buying the winning bid of her NFT auction in an effort to inflate the price of the collection.</p>
<p>This year, Melania Trump launched another batch of NFTs titled &ldquo;The 1776 Collection&rdquo;, timed for the US Independence Day, which seemed to have rolled out smoothly. Yet, her most recent NFT collection with the theme of Apollo 11 may have got the former first lady in trouble with NASA! Apparently, the agency doesn't approve of its images being used in connection with NFTs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;NASA is not approving any merchandising applications involving Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), as they are not consistent with the categories of products the agency is approved to merchandise,&rdquo; the document on the NASA website reads.&nbsp;</p>

Donald Trump&rsquo;s Controversial NFT Collection
<p>Even though Doland Trump had previously spoken out against crypto, he later followed his wife&rsquo;s steps and dropped his own NFT collection, &ldquo;Trump Digital Trading Cards&rdquo;. The first batch of NFTs, priced at $99 each, was sold within just 12 hours, raising over $5 million in the process. However, the floor price of the collectibles quickly dipped after.</p>
<p>Ironically, what made the NFT collection surge in price again (by a whopping 462%!) was the news about the former president's indictment and his arrest in New York City. Following the sudden success of the collection, in April 2023, Trump decided to launch the second series of his &ldquo;Digital Trading Cards&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Trump-branded NFTs were widely criticized and ridiculed both in the political and crypto spaces. It was recently revealed that the 45th President had made somewhere between $500,000 and $1 million on the sale of his collection so far. It is not clear what Trump will use this money for. Some speculate that the sum is aimed at funding the former president&rsquo;s legal battles.</p>
<p>Donald Trump will be running for president again in the upcoming 2024 election, along with other pro-crypto candidates.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The UK&rsquo;s National Crime Agency (NCA) began advertising roles to expand its cryptocurrency investigation team. </p>
<p>The UK&rsquo;s National Crime Agency (NCA) is actively recruiting for senior roles to carry out cryptocurrency investigations.</p>
<p>The NCA seeks to expand its task force on digital asset investigations and has posted four job opportunities on its website. The NCA appoints four senior investigators to join its Complex Financial Crime Team (CFTC) to assist with digital asset-related crimes.</p>
<p>The CFTC &ldquo;conducts high-end proactive illicit finance investigations,&rdquo; and the newly advertised roles fall under the scope of its newly formed Digital Assets Team (DAT). The DAT will ensure &ldquo;complex investigations into Blockchain-enabled crime are fully in compliance with the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 (CPIA).&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to the NCA website,</p>

<p>&ldquo;It involves enquiries into criminal activity within virtual arenas, high end of high harm cryptocurrency and virtual assets fraud and money laundering offences carried out by significant organised crime groups and state actors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The positions require individuals to work alongside and collaborate with CPS, investigators, intelligence and analysis staff to ensure disclosure requirements are accordingly dealt with.</p>
UK Sets Up Investigative Unit to Deal With Illicit Crypto-Related Activities
<p>Along with the need for a more comprehensive need for crypto regulation, so too does the market exist for teams and agencies to investigate crypto-related activities. The UK&rsquo;s NCA established its digital asset team earlier this year due to the massive investor losses incurred by numerous scandals that shook the industry.</p>
<p>The country&rsquo;s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) undertook a mission to shut down all illicit crypto ATM sites and successfully put an end to 26 locations in July.</p>
<p>The UK has also made strides in crypto regulation. The UK Parliament passed a bill last month that could help authorities seize and freeze cryptocurrencies that have been used in criminal activities.</p>

It has been tuned to track all major launchpad and IDO platforms, providing a more holistic view of the startup landscape. Initially having a surface level set of assets that were limited in scope, the upgraded chatbot has been plugged in to service over 5,000 coins/tokens (and will be constantly expanding).</p>
<p>As it pertains to the bug fixes, all minor and major points of friction for the users have been mended. Response times have been compressed, accuracy has been calibrated for higher contextual fidelity, and error potential has been minimized.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Alphabet, the parent company of Google, said it had reduced its stake in trading app operator Robinhood Markets by nearly 90%. </p>
<p>According to an SEC filing, Alphabet reduced its exposure to Robinhood Market by 90%.</p>
Google-Parent Company Dumps Robinhood Stock
<p>Alphabet cut its exposure to Robinhood Markets by nearly 90% as Robinhood experiences difficulties with a slowdown in its business. According to reports by Reuters, Alphabet invested in the trading app operators when it was still an unlisted startup. The company reportedly held over 4.9 million Robinhood shares by the end of 2021.</p>
<p>Robinhood shares peaked in August 2021, and soon after its IPO, Alphabet&rsquo;s stake was worth approximately $419 million.</p>
<p>Since reaching their high in 2021, Robinhood&rsquo;s shares have dropped 86%. The company has struggled since its IPO after seeing a massive user surge during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Robinhood has, however, been very involved in the memecoin frenzy and retail trading outrage at payment for order flow, CNBC reports.</p>
<p>Robinhood recorded a profit last week for the first time since becoming a public company.</p>
Robinhood Undertakes Third Round of Layoffs in a Year
<p>The famous online brokerage firm announced in June that it would lay off around 150 full-time employees, around 7% of its workforce.</p>
<p>The most recent wave of job cuts marks Robinhood&rsquo;s third round in just over a year, reflecting the company&rsquo;s struggles with ongoing market fluctuations.</p>
<p>The company further recorded a 30% loss in Q1 2023. The trading app said its crypto business brought in $38 million in Q1, down 30% from $54 million in Q2 2022.</p>
<p>Robinhood struggles have been exacerbated after the SEC sued Binance and Coinbase and alleged specific crypto tokens were securities. In the days following the lawsuits, Robinhood removed Solana, Cardano, and Polygon from its platform.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Boredom reigns as regards the bitcoin price, as sideways and downwards movement enters its seventh week.</p>
Volatility will come
<p>Could it be that it is just because it&rsquo;s crypto that investors get so bored so quickly? If it were a major stock on the S&amp;P, such price action would be taken as perfectly normal and nothing to get vexed about.</p>
<p>However, in the world of crypto, investors are used to the volatility that cryptocurrencies usually provide, and even though bitcoin is easily the biggest of the cryptocurrencies, it still retains the ability to shoot up or down with a fair measure of velocity.</p>
<p>From a charting perspective moving sideways and downwards suggests a descending channel, which is a bullish formation. If this channel initiates after a spike to the upside, it becomes a bull flag - an even more bullish chart pattern.</p>
Three major supports await
<p>It might appear to be one of the less perfect bull flags, given that both candle bodies and wicks have on occasion escaped to the upside, before being drawn back into the channel, but a bull flag it still remains.</p>
<p>Look for volatility to come back as this bitcoin bull flag slowly approaches the point when it really needs to break, with three major supports waiting.</p>
<p>Support number one is the 0.618 Fibonacci for this latest move, followed by support two, in the form of the upwards trendline from the beginning of the year, and finally support three which is the 200-day moving average.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bitcoin is converging towards all three of these supports and therefore something has to give. The fact that it is in a bull flag would certainly give a lot more confidence to the bulls.</p>
Expect the unexpected
<p>However, from a trading perspective, it might appear just too easy for bitcoin to reach the supports and then make the expected surge to the upside. Trading generally doesn&rsquo;t follow the expectations of the herd.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore there probably needs to be some kind of divergence from the script, and this might mean that bitcoin gets sent skyward before reaching the support, or it could fall through support before reversing back up.</p>
<p>Many other scenarios can also be taken into account. Whatever happens, traders should keep their wits about them.</p>
<p>For those who aren&rsquo;t watching the lower time frame charts, if bitcoin dips it might just be an excellent time to enter the market or buy more. However, all should follow a comprehensive risk management process and perhaps take expert advice. Trade carefully.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Indian government is using its time as president of the G20 nations to drum up support for globally coordinated regulation of crypto assets.</p>
Getting tough on digital assets
<p>The Indian government, along with its central bank, has been a harsh critic of cryptocurrencies for some time now. Therefore, it comes as little surprise that India is using its time as president of the G20 nations to try to implement coordinated regulations that will get tough on digital assets.</p>
<p>As India uses its influence to suppress cryptocurrencies, ably assisted by global financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) among others, it often resorts to claims that it is doing so in order to ensure monetary stability, and it continually refers back to the FTX collapse as a reason for doing so.</p>
Protecting the banking system?
<p>Ensuring monetary stability might well mean protecting a banking system that is on the verge of collapse - only able to support itself by printed money out of the magician&rsquo;s hat wielded by the US Federal Reserve. This &lsquo;money&rsquo; out of thin air is claimed to &ldquo;cost nothing&rdquo;, and for the Federal Reserve this may well be the case. However, for the vast majority of the world&rsquo;s citizens this means more currency flooding the economy and &lsquo;debasement&rsquo; of their purchasing power.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the FTX debacle, which is used by those doing the bidding of the bankers to tarnish the entire crypto industry, there are many unanswered questions as to how Sam Bankman&rsquo;s empire grew out of nothing, and how such fraud was allowed to take place right under the nose of the SEC.</p>
Risks
<p>Be that as it may, India will go ahead and promote a &ldquo;Synthesis Paper&rdquo; which is being produced by the IMF and the FSB that will enable the perceived &lsquo;risks&rsquo; of cryptocurrencies to be dealt with.</p>
<p>These &lsquo;risks&rsquo; might include that the people use their fiat currencies to buy such assets as bitcoin (God forbid) in order to protect themselves from the crushing debasement that is taking place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The risks do include the possibility of a &ldquo;spillover&rdquo; from crypto into the traditional financial system. But how a fledgling ecosystem of around $1.2 trillion is going to affect the traditional financial system of $hundreds of trillions remains to be seen.</p>

<p>The risks do include the possibility of a &ldquo;spillover&rdquo; from crypto into the traditional financial system. But how a fledgling ecosystem of around $1.2 trillion is going to affect the traditional financial system of $hundreds of trillions remains to be seen.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>OPNX, the newly launched crypto exchange by founders of the now-defunct Three Arrows Capital (3AC), has reportedly launched a bid to take over struggling crypto lender Hodlnaut.</p>
<p>If the bid is approved, the deal could see an injection of around $30 million worth of FLEX tokens into Hodlnaut.&nbsp;</p>
A White Knight Investor For Hodlnaut?&nbsp;
<p>According to a report in Bloomberg, the OPNX exchange has made an offer to acquire 75% of the struggling crypto lender. The bid comes at a critical time for Hodlnaut, which is undergoing a restructuring plan under the supervision of a Singapore court. The deal would see a significant capital injection into Hodlnaut and would partially cover outstanding claims and creditor payouts. If the deal is approved, creditors will receive 30% of their claims in FLEX tokens and other cryptocurrencies. This offer also gives them a direct stake in the future potential of the entity being acquired.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternatively, creditors also have the choice of opting for a pro-rata payment, allowing them to recover about 95% of the available corporate asset pool. According to OPNX, this option prioritizes the immediate financial recovery and stability of creditors. However, the bid is subject to approval from Hodlnaut&rsquo;s creditors, who effectively hold the fate of the acquisition in their hands. The creditors&rsquo; decisions could also have a significant impact on the larger crypto-lending ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
Unclear If Deal Goes Through&nbsp;
<p>So far, it remains to be seen if Hodlnaut&rsquo;s creditors will accept the deal. Back in April, a significant majority of the struggling crypto lender&rsquo;s creditors indicated their desire to liquidate the company. In a letter from the interim judicial manager (IJM), users representing 55.38% of creditors having claims of around 228.3 million Singaporean dollars ($170 million) have indicated that they prefer liquidation rather than restructuring. However, at the time, there was no source of fresh capital for the company.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There appears to be no indication of a white knight investor to date, and hence no prospect of any fresh capital injection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, only users with around 2.42% of claims supported looking into the restructuring option. However, all of these claims belonged to company directors. A mediation proposal was also opposed by the major creditors of the company, including Samtrade Custodian and SAM Fintech, and the Algorand Foundation. Algorand has a $35 million exposure to Hodlnaut.&nbsp;</p>
The Hodlnaut Fiasco&nbsp;
<p>Hodlnaut halted all withdrawals in August 2022, as the turmoil in the crypto markets led to a significant liquidity crisis for the crypto lender. Eventually, the company entered into judicial management, temporarily protecting it against legal action. Following this, the company entered into a court-based restructuring process, shedding light on the extent of its financial difficulties. The company had stated at the time,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are aiming to avoid a forced liquidation of our assets as it [&hellip;] will require us to sell our users&rsquo; cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, and WBTC at these current depressed asset prices.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With Hodlnaut struggling with the complexities of financial rehabilitation and creditor interests, founders Zhu Juntao and Simon Lee proposed selling the business as an alternative to liquidation, arguing it would result in a more favorable outcome for creditors. Furthermore, regulatory concerns have also compounded troubles, with figures associated with Hodlnaut and OPNX facing reprimands in Dubai for operating OPNX without the necessary local licenses.&nbsp;</p>
The OPNX Exchange And Its 3AC Connection
<p>The FLEX token is the native token of the CoinFLEX exchange, founded by Sudhu Arumugam and Mark Lamb. Arumugam and Lamb are also the co-founders of OPNX, a crypto claims trading marketplace. Other co-founders of OPNX include Kyle Davies and Su Zhu, who founded the now-bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. Creditors are pursuing both Zhu and Davies in the US over bankruptcy proceedings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The legal team representing creditors filed a motion urging that Davies be held in contempt of court for wilfully ignoring a subpoena connected to the firm&rsquo;s bankruptcy proceedings. Creditors have alleged that Davies is purposely delaying asset recovery. However, the motion does not apply to co-founder Su Zhu, who, thanks to his Singaporean nationality, is not subject to the jurisdiction of US courts.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Web3 video games franchise WAGMI Games has announced a couple of new executive hires, enhancing its dynamic team with experienced talent from some of the biggest names in the gaming industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new hires include Esteban Gil, formerly of Garena Free Fire, and Brent Pease, who previously held a senior role at Electronic Arts, the legendary company behind the FIFA football franchise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>WAGMI said it was delighted to be able to announce the new hires, who bring a wealth of expertise from established games developers to help transform the industry with the unique advantages of Web3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you haven't heard of WAGMI, it&rsquo;s essentially a video games studio that&rsquo;s focused on Web3 gaming. In Web3 video games, players are uniquely able to own in-game assets such as characters, weapons and skins, which are represented by non-fungible tokens that can be bought and sold at will. Web3 gaming also provides unique incentives for players with in-game rewards such as WAGMI tokens which can be earned for completing daily challenges and beating other players in head-to-head matches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>WAGMI&rsquo;s flagship title is WAGMI Defense, a sci-fi themed tower defense game in the mould of Plants vs. Zombies or Kingdom Rush Vengeance. Players are required to strategically place their troops and set their traps in order to defend their tower from the enemy onslaught. They need to stand up to the assault for three minutes per match, and with each round they win they&rsquo;ll earn an in-game resource called NiFe that can be used to buy other items or traded for cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gil, who previously led Garena Free Fire and served as Lean Portfolio Management at Respawn and Apex Legends, is being hired to assume a similar role at WAGMI. In particular, he&rsquo;ll be tasked with overseeing the company&rsquo;s business strategy development, focused on driving demand for consumer-oriented products.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a statement, Gil said he&rsquo;s excited to apply his skills and experience to Web3, and stated his belief that technologies such as NFTs can revolutionize the gaming industry. &ldquo;By leveraging these cutting-edge technologies, we can deliver even more engaging and immersive gaming experiences to our fans around the world,&rdquo; he added.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for Pease, he joins the company from EA, where he most recently served as its Director of Operations. As a highly experienced industry executive, he will assume a combined COO/GM role at WAGMIU, where he&rsquo;ll be tasked with overseeing the company&rsquo;s day-to-day operations and focus on the implementation of key growth strategies. Pease is said to be a widely respected figure in the video gaming industry, having previously founded Industrial Toys, which was later acquired by EA.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;'I am honored to have been asked to bring my 30 years of experience in building games and companies to this incredible team of passionate creators,&rdquo; Pease said. &ldquo;This is the most exciting vision for players I have seen and I look forward to making amazing games at WAGMI that thrill our ever-growing community.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is certainly lots of room for WAGMI to grow. At present, Web3 games attract barely 3% of the estimated three billion video games players in the world. Yet WAGMI says the advantages of Web3 gaming are so compelling that if it&rsquo;s able to lower the barrier to entry by easing onboarding friction, this number will surely grow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, is Web3 gaming is to really catch on, the industry will need to develop truly engaging games that can capture the imagination of millions of gamers, just as legendary titles from the Web2 gaming world, such as GTA and Fortnite, have done. This explains WAGMI&rsquo;s decision to go after talent with experience in the traditional video game industry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To have AAA Talent like Brent and Esteban join our team is a real testament to what we are building,&rdquo; said WAGMI&rsquo;s chief executive Ian Bentley. &ldquo;They see clearly not only our vision as a franchise, but also this once in a lifetime opportunity to be a part of history in evolving the gaming space.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Prominent crypto analyst and investor Adam Cochran has called into question the solvency of Huobi, the 12th largest cryptocurrency exchange globally by spot trading volume.In a series of recent tweets, Cochran pointed to significant discrepancies in Huobi's reported Tether (USDT) holdings, suggesting that the firm might be failing to meet its financial obligations. Cochran bases his assertions on a detailed examination of Huobi's balance sheets and the recent activities of Justin Sun, the founder of Tron. Despite these allegations, Huobi maintains that all operations are proceeding as normal.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">According to Cochran's investigation, Huobi's own "Merkle Tree Audit" indicates a significant discrepancy in the exchange's held assets. He points out that while the audit lists that Huobi users hold $631 million worth of Tether (USDT), Huobi's actual holdings amount to only $90 million. This significant gap, Cochran alleges, is indicative of insolvency. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Cochran further argues that Sun has been treating the exchange like a personal piggy bank, transferring funds to his decentralized finance (DeFi) projects and thus leaving the exchange unable to meet its obligations. Specifically, he alleges that Sun is inflating the yield on his DeFi apps to entice more deposits into Huobi.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Adding to the concerns, Cochran noted a substantial sell-off of Tether (USDT) on Binance, which he believes is connected to the solvency fears surrounding Huobi. He also raised questions about Sun's recently launched "stUSDT", a variant of USDT that Sun claims is backed by government bonds. Cochran alleges that the stUSDT does not have sufficient backing, which further compounds the potential risk.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Cochran also pointed out that certain Huobi and Tron executives are reportedly under investigation by Chinese authorities, a development that has fanned the flames of these allegations. These apprehended individuals reportedly include key personnel from both organizations, adding more credibrility to the concerns about Huobi's financial stability.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Huobi has denied any wrongdoing and maintains that all operations are running normally. However, Cochran dismissed these assertions, stating that his source, a senior executive at Tron, confirmed that team members are indeed under investigation due to actions related to Huobi.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Cochran's analysis, if accurate, paints a worrying picture for Huobi's financial health, adding fuel to rumors of the company's potential insolvency. If Huobi users begin to lose faith in the exchange's financial stability, it could lead to a mass exodus from the platform and significant upheaval in the crypto market.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Alchemix, a lending platform, has reported that all the funds stolen by the Curve Finance hacker from Alchemix&rsquo;s alETH-ETH pool have been returned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Curve Finance had fallen victim to a major heist on the 31st of July, leading to the hacker draining around $61 million from the protocol.&nbsp;</p>
Alchemix Announces Return Of All Funds&nbsp;
<p>The Curve Finance exploit had resulted in Alchemix losing around $13.6 million from its alETH-ETH pool. Apart from Alchemix, several other pools also saw their funds drained. These included JPEGd&rsquo;s pETH-ETH pool, which saw outflows of around $11.4 million, and Metronome&rsquo;s sETH-ETH pool, which saw the exploit drain about $1.6 million. The hacker had targeted several stable pools on Curve Finance using a reentrancy bug that impacted the Vyper programming language used on Curve Finance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, Alchemix has announced on X that the hacker has returned the stolen funds after accepting a bug bounty offer from Curve, Metronome, and Alchemix.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are extremely happy to announce that all funds stolen by the hacker of the Alchemix @CurveFinance pool have now been returned.&rdquo;</p>

An Offer The Hacker Couldn&rsquo;t Refuse&nbsp;
<p>Alchemix, Metronome, and Curve Finance had offered the hacker a 10% bug bounty as a reward, asking them to return the remaining 90% of the stolen funds. The three entities had stated that if the hacker returned the funds, they would not face any further legal or law enforcement actions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The offer comes with a guarantee of no further legal actions or involvement of law enforcement. We want to resolve this in a civilized manner. You will have no risk of us pursuing this further, no risk of law enforcement issues.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, the three protocols also told the hacker to view their offer as a final warning, giving them until the 6th of August to accept their offer. They warned that if the hacker refused or ignored their warning, they would be expanding the bounty to the public, offering 10% of the funds to anyone who would help identify the hacker in a way that would lead to conviction in court. The stark warning stated that the hacker would feel the full force of the law should he fail to comply.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you choose not to partake in the voluntary return and complete the process by the 6th of August at 0800 UTC, we will expand the bounty to the public and offer the full 10% to the person who is able to identify you in a way that leads to your conviction in the courts. We will pursue you from all angles with the full extent of the law.&rdquo;</p>

Hacker Accepts Offer And Returns Funds&nbsp;
<p>On the 4th of August, the hacker posted a message on the Ethereum network directed at Curve Finance and Alchemix development teams. In the not-so-pleasant message, the hacker stated that they would return the funds, but because they did not want to ruin the multiple projects impacted, and not because they were caught or because of the threat of legal action. The hacker stated in his on-chain message,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m refunding, not because you can find me. It&rsquo;s because I don&rsquo;t want to ruin your project.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At around 11:16 am UTC, the hacker returned 1 alETH to the Curve Finance deployer account. Following the success of the initial transaction, the hacker made three separate transfers two hours later, totaling around 4820.55 alETH, sent to the Alchemix development team&rsquo;s multisig wallet. The funds returned were around $8.9 million worth of crypto assets, making up around 15% of the stolen funds. Alchemix later reported that the hacker returned all of the stolen funds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NFT protocol JPEG&rsquo;d, in a separate announcement, also confirmed that they had been refunded, with the perpetrators returning around 5495 ETH. As stated in the bounty offer, the NFT protocol will not be taking any legal action against the hackers. The JPEG&rsquo;d team stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>​​&ldquo;Any further investigations or legal matters against the entity will end. We view this occurrence as a white-hat rescue.&rdquo;</p>

DeFi Breathes A Sigh Of Relief&nbsp;
<p>The Curve Finance exploit had put considerable pressure on the larger DeFi ecosystem after the value of the protocol&rsquo;s CRV token plummeted after the hack. Several reports that emerged after the hack stated that Curve founder Michael Egorov had taken several loans, putting up CRV as collateral, putting Egorov&rsquo;s $168 million lending position at risk of liquidation. This put major DeFi protocols Aave, Abracadabra, and several others at risk as well, thanks to a potential domino effect.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alchemix, a lending platform, has reported that all the funds stolen by the Curve Finance hacker from Alchemix&rsquo;s alETH-ETH pool have been returned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Curve Finance had fallen victim to a major heist on the 31st of July, leading to the hacker draining around $61 million from the protocol.&nbsp;</p>
Alchemix Announces Return Of All Funds&nbsp;
<p>The Curve Finance exploit had resulted in Alchemix losing around $13.6 million from its alETH-ETH pool. Apart from Alchemix, several other pools also saw their funds drained. These included JPEGd&rsquo;s pETH-ETH pool, which saw outflows of around $11.4 million, and Metronome&rsquo;s sETH-ETH pool, which saw the exploit drain about $1.6 million. The hacker had targeted several stable pools on Curve Finance using a reentrancy bug that impacted the Vyper programming language used on Curve Finance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, Alchemix has announced on X that the hacker has returned the stolen funds after accepting a bug bounty offer from Curve, Metronome, and Alchemix.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are extremely happy to announce that all funds stolen by the hacker of the Alchemix @CurveFinance pool have now been returned.&rdquo;</p>

An Offer The Hacker Couldn&rsquo;t Refuse&nbsp;
<p>Alchemix, Metronome, and Curve Finance had offered the hacker a 10% bug bounty as a reward, asking them to return the remaining 90% of the stolen funds. The three entities had stated that if the hacker returned the funds, they would not face any further legal or law enforcement actions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The offer comes with a guarantee of no further legal actions or involvement of law enforcement. We want to resolve this in a civilized manner. You will have no risk of us pursuing this further, no risk of law enforcement issues.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, the three protocols also told the hacker to view their offer as a final warning, giving them until the 6th of August to accept their offer. They warned that if the hacker refused or ignored their warning, they would be expanding the bounty to the public, offering 10% of the funds to anyone who would help identify the hacker in a way that would lead to conviction in court. The stark warning stated that the hacker would feel the full force of the law should he fail to comply.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you choose not to partake in the voluntary return and complete the process by the 6th of August at 0800 UTC, we will expand the bounty to the public and offer the full 10% to the person who is able to identify you in a way that leads to your conviction in the courts. We will pursue you from all angles with the full extent of the law.&rdquo;</p>

Hacker Accepts Offer And Returns Funds&nbsp;
<p>On the 4th of August, the hacker posted a message on the Ethereum network directed at Curve Finance and Alchemix development teams. In the not-so-pleasant message, the hacker stated that they would return the funds, but because they did not want to ruin the multiple projects impacted, and not because they were caught or because of the threat of legal action. The hacker stated in his on-chain message,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m refunding, not because you can find me. It&rsquo;s because I don&rsquo;t want to ruin your project.&rdquo;</p>
