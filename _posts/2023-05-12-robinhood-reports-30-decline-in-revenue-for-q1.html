<p>Stock trading app Robinhood reported that its crypto business brought in $38 million in Q1 for 2023, down 30% from $54 million in Q1 2022. </p>
<p>Cryptocurrency and stock trading app Robinhood reported its first quarter revenue for 2023, revealing a 29.6% year-on-year decline for its cryptocurrency trading division. In its filing, the firm also reported an increase of 26% in assets under custody which now amounts to $78 billion. Around 15%, or $12 billion, of the assets under custody, are crypto assets on its trading platform &ndash; 40% less compared to Q1 2022.</p>
<p>Despite declining crypto trading revenue, the trading app&rsquo;s total revenue increased year-on-year, amounting to $441 million compared to Q1 2022&rsquo;s revenue of $229 million. Robinhood&rsquo;s total year-on-year trading revenue increased by 47.5%.</p>
<p>As a result of the US Federal Reserve&rsquo;s recent rate hikes, Robinhood earned handsomely from interest. Q1 revenue is up 16% from Q4 2022.</p>
<p>Although the firm&rsquo;s overall revenue increased, the app witnessed a decline in monthly active users. In Q1 2022, Robinhood had 15.9 million users, but this number decreased to 11.8 million.</p>
<p>Jason Warnick, Robinhood&rsquo;s Chief Financial Officer, commented on the firm&rsquo;s report saying:</p>

<p>The broader macro backdrop has been tougher on trading volumes and engagement with brokerages.</p>

<p>Vlad Tenev, Robinhood CEO, remained optimistic over the firm&rsquo;s report:</p>

<p>In the face of uncertainty in the&nbsp;banking sector, we&rsquo;re continuing to see strong net deposits and improving customer satisfaction.</p>

Robinhood Will Soon Launch 24-Hour Weekday Stock Trading
<p>Robinhood said it would soon allow users to engage in 24-hour trading of selected exchange-traded funds and popular stocks such as Tesla and Apple, Forbes reports. Robinhood will become the first US brokerage to offer 24-hour trading in individual stocks after it announced its plans on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Tenev told The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) that the 24-hour service would enable round-the-clock trading in 43 securities between 8 p.m. ET Sunday and 8 p.m. ET Friday, with plans to add more securities to this list.</p>
