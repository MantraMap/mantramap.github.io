<p>Following the viral US Congress Hearing about UFOs, over 50 alien-themed tokens have emerged on the crypto market.</p>
The US Government Blamed for Covering up Alien Activity
<p>On July 26, the House Oversight Subcommittee on National Security held a highly-anticipated hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), commonly known as unidentified flying objects (UFOs). Three former military officials accused the US government of concealing important extraterrestrial findings.</p>
<p>According to the whistleblower David Grusch, who is a former Air Force intelligence officer, the Pentagon is covering up a &ldquo;multidecade&rdquo; UAP program which aims at collecting and restoring crashed extraterrestrial crafts. Grusch testified under oath that he is aware of an alien spacecraft in possession of the US government and the &ldquo;non-human&rdquo; biological remains that were found on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ryan Graves and David Fravor, retired US Navy commanders, also claimed to have seen UAP findings while serving in the military. While speakers said they couldn&rsquo;t share too much information due to it being classified, they raised concerns over the US government hiding too much regarding the matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If UAP are foreign drones, it is an urgent national security problem. If it is something else, it is an issue for science. In either case, unidentified objects are a concern for flight safety,&rdquo; said Ryan Graves.</p>

The Crypto Market Reacts to the Buzz
<p>The &ldquo;exciting&rdquo; hearing quickly went viral and became trending on Twitter and Google searches. Crypto traders couldn&rsquo;t miss the chance to capitalize on the new trend and launched over 50 alien-themed coins just over the span of 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tickers like &ldquo;ALIENX,&rdquo; &ldquo;UFO&rdquo;, and &ldquo;ALIEN&rdquo; have invaded the crypto market. However, most of these tokens haven&rsquo;t seen much trading activity so far. Only the larger and more established alien-themed coins have managed to improve their performance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, the native token of the popular blockchain game Alien Worlds, known as TLM, grew by 3.5% within 24 hours after the news broke. Among other UFO memecoins that have slightly climbed during the last day are the UFO Gaming Token (UFO) which gained 2.4% and the AlienFi token (ALIEN) which surged by 5.9%.</p>
<p>Memecoins are known to quickly emerge in the midst of a growing trend. However, many of them could potentially be scams that try to take advantage of the hype. So, traders should be very careful when choosing an asset for investment.&nbsp;</p>
