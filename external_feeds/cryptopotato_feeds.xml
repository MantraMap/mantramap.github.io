            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">With the bullish momentum lost, buyers have a difficult task at stopping this correction.</p>
<p><strong>Key Support levels: $0.0000090, $0.0000080</strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Resistance levels: $0.000010 </strong></p>
<h2>1. Sharp Reversal</h2>
<p>The price made a U-turn after reaching $0.000011 for a brief period. Sellers took full control of the price action in the past five days and they pushed SHIB back under $0.000010 which is the current resistance.</p>

<h2>2. Critical Support</h2>
<p>The support at $0.0000090 has to hold as the alternative is quite grim for SHIB. The last time the price tested the top of this wedge, it turned bullish. Failure here and this meme coin will tank further.</p>
<figure id="attachment_267021" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-267021" style="width: 2447px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-17_15-04-03.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-267021" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-17_15-04-03.png" alt="SHIBUSDT_2023-08-17_15-04-03" width="2447" height="1199" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-17_15-04-03.png 2447w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-17_15-04-03-300x147.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-17_15-04-03-1024x502.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-17_15-04-03-768x376.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-17_15-04-03-1536x753.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-17_15-04-03-2048x1003.png 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-17_15-04-03-50x24.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2447px) 100vw, 2447px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-267021" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>3. Bearish Cross on MACD</h2>
<p>The daily MACD is giving a clear sell signal after the moving averages did a bearish cross. This could be the start of a prolonged correction and SHIB may revisit lower levels before it finds good support.</p>
<figure id="attachment_267020" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-267020" style="width: 2447px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-17_15-05-12-1.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-267020" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-17_15-05-12-1.png" alt="SHIBUSDT_2023-08-17_15-05-12" width="2447" height="1199" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-17_15-05-12-1.png 2447w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-17_15-05-12-1-300x147.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-17_15-05-12-1-1024x502.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-17_15-05-12-1-768x376.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-17_15-05-12-1-1536x753.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-17_15-05-12-1-2048x1003.png 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-17_15-05-12-1-50x24.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2447px) 100vw, 2447px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-267020" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Bias</h2>
<p>The bias for SHIB is bearish.</p>
<h2>Short-Term Prediction for SHIB Price</h2>
<p>Wait to see if the support at $0.0000090 holds. If not, then expect $0.0000080 next. The bearish momentum may also intensify if the current support breaks which could see SHIB fall lower quite fast.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[SHIB, BCH, and UNI are among the poorest performance in the past 24 hours.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price action took another hit in the past 24 hours, and the asset plummeted to $28,300 for the first time in roughly two months.</p>
<p>The altcoins have suffered even more, with ETH slipping below $1,800 and the total market cap losing another $20 billion daily.</p>
<h2>BTC Sees 2-Month Low</h2>
<p>Bitcoin spent most of last week trading sideways in a tight range between $29,200 and $29,500. It was its most impressive price increase on Monday following <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/first-spot-bitcoin-etf-goes-live-in-europe-with-interesting-twist/" data-wpel-link="internal">news</a> about the first spot BTC ETF launching in Europe. The initial hype drove the asset to $29,700 (on Bitstamp).</p>
<p>However, the tides <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-dominance-on-the-rise-as-these-alts-tumbled-daily-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">turned</a> quickly after that, and BTC started losing value rather quickly. It found itself dipping to $29,000 by Tuesday, but the landscape worsened in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>The bears took complete control over the market and pushed the cryptocurrency south even more. This time, the asset fell to $28,300, which became its lowest price tag since mid-June.</p>
<p>Despite recovering a few hundred dollars since that <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/fundstrat-predicts-150k-bitcoin-price-but-btc-drops-to-8-week-low/" data-wpel-link="internal">multi-month low</a>, BTC is still about 2% down on the day. Its market cap has declined to $556 billion, but its dominance over the alts stands still at 49%.</p>
<figure id="attachment_267029" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-267029" style="width: 1793px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTCUSD-6.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-267029" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTCUSD-6.png" alt="BTCUSD.

Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Alts See Red (Again)</h2>
<p>The alternative coins dropped hard yesterday, and the situation today is quite similar. Ethereum is down from over $1,850 two days ago to just below $1,800.</p>
<p>Binance Coin has declined by a similar percentage to just over $230. Ripple, Cardano, Dogecoin, Solana, Tron, Polkadot, and Polygon are all in the red as well.</p>
<p>Even more losses come from the likes of Litecoin, Shiba Inu, TONCOIN, Uniswap, and Bitcoin Cash, which have all dumped by up to 8% in a day.</p>
<p>With most other lower- and mid-cap alts trading in the red today, it&#8217;s no wonder that the crypto market cap is down to $1.130 trillion on CMC. This means that the metric has seen $20 billion gone in the past 24 hours and $40 billion evaporated since Tuesday.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Market strategy and research firm Fundstrat made a bold Bitcoin price prediction a few hours before the asset tanked to a two-month low.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Speaking to CNBC on Aug. 16, Fundstrat analyst Tom Lee said that if the spot BTC ETF gets approved, the demand for Bitcoin will be greater than the supply.</p>
<p>He added that the firm’s crypto strategists predicted a clearing price of $150,000 to $180,000.</p>
<p>The bold prediction is before the end of next year and only if a spot ETF is approved in the United States, he reiterated.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">“If the Spot <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">#Bitcoin</a> ETF gets approved … the clearing price of <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">$BTC</a> is above $150,000.” – Tom Lee <a href="https://twitter.com/fundstrat?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@fundstrat</a> <a href="https://t.co/ILQZqdjsZA" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/ILQZqdjsZA</a></p>
<p>— Michael Saylor<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/26a1.png" alt="⚡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@saylor) <a href="https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1691805485018607878?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">August 16, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>No Six Figures Without ETF</h2>
<p>When asked what would happen if the ETF applications are rejected, Lee said the halving will still create demand and price gains, “but it won’t be six figures.”</p>
<p>It should be noted that Tom Lee is an uber-Bitcoin bull who has made bold predictions in the past. In late December 2020, Lee <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/better-than-this-year-bitcoin-price-to-hit-120000-in-2021-tom-lee-predicts/" data-wpel-link="internal">predicted</a> BTC would reach $120,000 the following year.</p>
<p>In August 2021, he <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-could-reach-100000-by-the-end-of-2021-fundstrats-tom-lee/" data-wpel-link="internal">said</a> that BTC prices would reach $100,000 by the end of the year. In reality, it peaked at $69,000 in November and declined into a multi-year bear market after that.</p>
<p>In February 2022, the Fundstrat Managing Partner <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/fundstrats-tom-lee-explains-how-bitcoin-could-hit-200000/" data-wpel-link="internal">predicted</a> that the Bitcoin price could surge to $200,000. However, by the end of 2022, BTC had slumped to a bear market cycle low of $16,000.</p>
<p>Now just a few hours after he offered a $150,000 BTC price forecast, the asset has slumped to a two-month low.</p>
<p>BTC has fallen 2% on the day to an intraday and two-month low of $28,430 during the Thursday morning Asian trading session.</p>
<p>The move followed the release of the minutes of a Federal Reserve meeting in which it said it did not expect a recession though officials still saw the need for higher rates.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Bears Lurking</h2>
<p>Despite the fact that Bitcoin is still <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-investors-reach-all-time-low-in-on-chain-spending-glassnode/" data-wpel-link="internal">trading sideways</a> on longer-term charts, the bearish sentiment is seeping in.</p>
<p>Analysts were saying that BTC looks very weak and a “savage breakdown” could be imminent.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Meanwhile, Willy Woo <a href="https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1691854547273282010" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">said</a> it was “crunch time for BTC,” adding:</p>

<p>The dip is the largest since July 24 but is pretty minor when zooming out to view the multi-month view.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PRESS RELEASE &#8211; Geneva, Switzerland, August 16th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://trondao.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><strong>TRON DAO</strong></a><strong> (“TRON”)</strong> is pleased to announce that it has joined the <a href="https://cryptocurrency-association.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><strong>Japan Cryptoasset Business Association</strong></a><strong> (“JCBA”)</strong> as an associate member starting from August 1st, 2023. As a leading global blockchain, TRON is committed to building cooperation and collaboration with other JCBA members to promote the growth of the crypto industry in Japan and all across Asia.</p>
<p>Established in 2016, JCBA is a Japanese-based association for stakeholders within the Web3 ecosystem. It aims to foster a promising environment for the development of digital assets, including cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and stablecoins. Currently, JCBA has 134 members from both Web3 and traditional industries based in Japan and internationally.</p>
<p>By joining as an associate member of JCBA, TRON strives to closely collaborate with the Japanese market and contribute to JCBA&#8217;s vision by leveraging TRON&#8217;s efficient network and robust userbase.</p>
<h2>About TRON DAO</h2>
<p>TRON DAO is a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps.</p>
<p>Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of August 2023, it has over 179.07 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 6.26 billion total transactions, and over $13.01 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN.</p>
<p>In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government’s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (“DMC”), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica’s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens &#8211; TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[A month after going live, OPNX created by founders of the collapsed 3AC, was slammed with a $2.7 million fine by Dubai's VARA.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Dubai&#8217;s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) fined OPNX — the cryptocurrency project created by founders of the defunct digital asset hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) — along with the project&#8217;s founders and CEO, shortly after issuing a reprimand in May.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While the executives have paid their fine, VARA said OPNX is yet to make payment, with the regulator considering taking actions against the platform.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">VARA Fined OPNX, CEO, and Founders $2.7M</h2>
<p dir="ltr">In an <a href="https://www.vara.ae/en/regulations/regulatory-notices/vara-notice-of-fines-opnx-exchange/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">enforcement notice</a> published on Wednesday (Aug. 16, 2023), VARA revealed that OPNX was yet to pay a fine of 10 million AED ($2.72 million) issued against it on May 2 for a market offense.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The regulator also issued a penalty fine of 200,000 AED ($54,450) to OPNX CEO Leslie Lamb, 3AC founders Su Zhu and Kylie Davies, and OPNX co-founder Mark Lamb on the same day for violating marketing, advertising, and promotions regulations. According to VARA, all four individuals have fully paid their fines.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The launch of OPNX in April 2023 was met with criticisms from the crypto community, majorly because the platform was created by Zhu and Davies, who were behind a previous cryptocurrency project that collapsed and left investors with huge losses. Currently, OPNX&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/OPNX_Official/status/1691607311167455338?t=vHYICC9bt8bclcBfL1TTSg&amp;s=19" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">average daily volume</a> is $102 million, with a 24-hour trade volume of over $165.8 million and a seven-day trade volume of $715 million.</p>
<p dir="ltr">OPNX later went ahead to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/3ac-founders-launch-brand-new-vc-fund-tied-to-opnx/" data-wpel-link="internal">announce</a> a new ecosystem partner, a venture capital fund called 3AC Ventures (separate from the defunct hedge fund 3AC), with Davies <a href="https://twitter.com/KyleLDavies/status/1671505640848515072?t=71lRoJ0JDbDTiXSTXa4oAg&amp;s=19" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">stating</a>, &#8220;3AC is dead, long live 3AC Ventures.&#8221; The VC fund, which, unsurprisingly, was not well received by community members, offers &#8220;superior risk-adjusted returns without leverage,&#8221; according to its website.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Dubai Taking Tough Stance Against OPNX</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Before the fines, VARA <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/dubai-regulator-reprimands-opnx-founders-for-conducting-unregulated-activity/" data-wpel-link="internal">reprimanded</a> Zhu, Davies, Mark Lamb, Leslie Lamb, and Sudhu Arumugan for carrying out unregulated activities in Dubai and for also promoting and marketing OPNX to residents without regulatory approval.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, the regulator is looking to take further actions against OPNX for its failure to pay its fine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Vara shall determine consequential actions warranted against OPNX, which may include further fines, penalties, and/or taking any actions necessary to recover payment and definitively remedy the behavior including, but not limited to, referring the matter to any law enforcement agency(ies) or competent courts.&#8221;</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[SDF's commercial partnership with MoneyGram officially began in 2021.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) &#8211; the organization behind the Stellar network that facilitates cross-border transactions &#8211; announced becoming a minority investor in payments giant MoneyGram International.</p>
<p>The latest investment is the first of its kind made from SDF&#8217;s treasury which includes a position on MGI&#8217;s Board of Directors. Denelle Dixon, SDF CEO and Executive Director, will occupy that role, according to the official announcement.</p>
<h2>Stellar x MoneyGram</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://stellar.org/blog/sdfs-investment-in-moneygram-international" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">investment</a> was sourced from SDF&#8217;s internal cash reserve, Dixon said in a statement. This cash reserve is designated to support the operations of the non-profit organization rather than the Enterprize Fund, which targets investments in startups and emerging businesses.</p>
<p>The exec mentioned that the investment is expected to position SDF as a crucial player aiding MoneyGram in expanding its digital business, exploring blockchain technology, and contributing to the many other ways the fintech company allows consumers and businesses to transfer and manage money in nearly every country across the globe.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This is an exciting time for SDF and MGI, and I believe the opportunities will only grow. Continuing to build strong partnerships with organizations across the payments space puts SDF one step closer to achieving our mission of creating equitable access to financial services.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>MoneyGram and SDF&#8217;s <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/stellar-lumens-xlm-spikes-12-after-news-of-a-partnership-between-moneygram-and-the-stellar-foundation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">partnership</a> dates back to October 2021, when the two joined forces to settle transactions with USDC stablecoin for instant and cheaper transactions.</p>
<h2>Bidding Ripple Adieu</h2>
<p>The payments firm previously partnered with Stellar&#8217;s direct competitor to leverage the RippleNet as part of the exchange settlements process for international remittances. MoneyGram also received financial incentives in the form of XRP in exchange for giving Ripple an equity stake in the company.</p>
<p>MoneyGram, however, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-and-moneygram-part-ways-amid-sec-litigation-while-xrp-eyes-0-50/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">severed its ties</a> with Ripple in March 2021, a few months after the SEC slapped the blockchain firm with a lawsuit over XRP. At that time, Ripple maintained that the decision to part ways was mutual and hinted at a potential rekindling once the legal spat was over.</p>
<p>While Ripple secured a partial victory against the SEC this year, MoneyGram has not yet revisited the idea of reinstating the partnership. With SDF, on the other hand, the payment company <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/moneygram-to-partner-with-stellar-to-provide-stablecoin-remittances/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">announced</a> plans to offer stablecoin remittances last year.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The Shibarium mainnet is now live and ready for users and developers alike.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, Shiba Inu (SHIB) developers appeared on stage at the Blockchain Futurist Conference in Toronto to discuss the “End Game” for Shibarium – the meme token’s metaverse and NFT-oriented layer 2 blockchain.</p>
<p>The team said that the Shibarium mainnet has gone live, allowing developers to begin building apps on the blockchain.</p>
<ul>
<li>The ecosystem will include “Shibdentities,” a proof of personhood solution that lets users retain control of their data and privacy.</li>
<li>Shibdentities can be used to create digital wills, which transfer assets to another user’s wallet after one person’s death is confirmed.</li>
<li>“We are building a decentralized, autonomous, digital nation state,” said the team during its keynote presentation.</li>
<li>Regarding the Shibarium metaverse, the ecosystem will feature “seamless transactions” and its “Shiboshi” NFTs.</li>
<li>Shibarium will also use an “super app” called the ShibaHub – a common location for accessing a users’ favorite dapps.</li>
<li>Like many layer 2 solutions, “Shibarium” aims to address the scaling issues and transaction costs that plague Ethereum’s base layer.</li>
<li>Until now, details about Shibarium’s technical development have been largely a mystery.</li>
<li>However, lead developer Shytoshi Kusama has provided many hints about what features it will include, such as <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/shiba-inu-pumps-after-lead-developer-shares-shibarium-update-details/" data-wpel-link="internal">real-world asset authentication</a>.</li>
<li>SHIB is currently the 13th largest crypto by market cap.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[Disparte called for relevant federal legislation around stablecoins to protect consumers and prevent investors from companies with fake USD.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dante Disparte, the chief strategy officer and head of global policy of the second-largest stablecoin issuer Circle, has blasted crypto firms that create counterfeits of the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>According to a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-15/circle-criticizes-crypto-firms-that-counterfeit-us-dollars" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">report</a>, Disparte called for relevant federal legislation around stablecoins to protect consumers and prevent investors from companies with fake USD.</p>
<h2>Circle CSO Criticizes Firms That Counterfeit USD</h2>
<p>Disparte said the several bank failures in the U.S. earlier this year drove investors into unsafe and opaque crypto assets overseas, showing the need for sound monetary policy in the United States. He questioned the ability of any company to forge the USD using cryptographic methods, insisting that setting relevant rules would maintain transparency and ensure investor safety.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Candidly, should anyone anywhere be able to counterfeit U.S. dollar using cryptographic methods, or should there be a rule-set around competing with digital dollars on the internet where the safety and soundness and monetary policy of the United States is respected?” &#8211; he asked.</p></blockquote>
<p>Disparte’s remarks come as Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) sees a slump in its market dominance. The stablecoin, once favored by institutions, was negatively affected by its exposure to the now-bankrupt Silicon Valley Bank and worldwide regulatory scrutiny on crypto assets.</p>
<p>USDC’s supply has declined by more than 50% since June 2022, from $56 billion to around $26 billion. This has also affected its market share, which has dwindled significantly within the same period, while Tether – the largest stablecoin by market cap – continues to gain dominance.</p>
<h2>Circle Faces International Markets</h2>
<p>While USDC’s numbers are declining, Circle has disclosed its intention to face international crypto markets with Asia as the focus. In June, the company’s co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/circle-pays-close-attention-to-hong-kongs-crypto-policies-ceo-allaire-says/" data-wpel-link="internal">said</a> Circle is closely observing the regulatory developments in Hong Kong as the city aims to establish itself as a significant center for digital markets and stablecoins.</p>
<p>Most recently, Allaire <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/circles-jeremy-allaire-estimates-majority-of-usdc-adoption-originates-beyond-us-borders/" data-wpel-link="internal">estimated</a> that 70% of USDC adoption originates from non-U.S. regions, with Asia, Latin America, and Africa leading the pace. However, he <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/the-us-will-become-a-highly-competitive-market-once-it-embraces-crypto-circle-ceo-says/" data-wpel-link="internal">believes</a> the U.S. will become a highly competitive market once its regulators embrace the crypto industry.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Circle and Tether are facing competition from newly issued stablecoins like that of digital payments giant <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/paypal-launches-usd-stablecoin-for-payments-and-transfers/" data-wpel-link="internal">PayPal Holdings</a>.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The former President’s reported crypto holdings have shot up to nearly $3 million.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Updated filings show that former President Donald Trump owns $2.8 million worth of cryptocurrency in his Ethereum wallet – a far higher amount than disclosures from earlier this month appeared to suggest.</p>
<p>The disclosures paint a different picture of Trump’s views on crypto than his public pronouncements about the asset class would seem to suggest.</p>
<h2>Trumps Crypto and NFT Earnings</h2>
<p>As <a href="https://www.citizensforethics.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Disclosure-Report-Part-38-14-23.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">submitted</a> to the Office of Government Ethics, entry 24 under Trump’s “Employment Assets and Income and Retirement Accounts” lists a series of items related to crypto and NFTs.</p>
<p>The item is titled “CIC Digital LLC (License fees for NFTs)” and is subdivided into three parts: One of those parts included his Ethereum crypto wallet, which contained $2,806,341 in assets at disclosure time.</p>
<p>Another part – listed as “License agreement with NFT INT, LLC” – related to Trump’s earnings from a non-fungible token (NFT) collection he <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/donald-trump-reportedly-earned-up-to-1-million-from-his-latest-nft-collection/" data-wpel-link="internal">launched</a> as part of his relaunched election campaign to return to the White House in 2024. This amount totaled $4,866,832.</p>
<p>The first installment of the collection performed well, even surging after Trump’s first indictment in early April. However, it crashed later that month when he announced the launch of a <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/new-donald-trump-nfts-to-hit-the-market-again-but-heres-the-catch/" data-wpel-link="internal">second batch</a> of NFTs on Polygon.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Trump’s OGE financial disclosure documents <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/donald-trump-holds-between-250k-and-500k-worth-of-eth/" data-wpel-link="internal">stated</a> that he owned between $250,000 and $500,000 in his ETH wallet. This wallet was also connected to his NFT collection.</p>
<p>Trump’s wife Melania has also dabbled in NFT sales, launching an <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/melania-trump-launches-an-nft-and-blockchain-venture-based-on-solana/" data-wpel-link="internal">NFT venture</a> on Solana in 2021 featuring digital and physical art. Part of the proceeds were used to raise money for children aging out of the foster care system.</p>
<p>Melania also announced a set of 10,000 official NFTs celebrating Trump on President’s Day last year, meant to highlight “iconic” moments of the Trump administration.</p>
<h2>Trump’s Past Claims About Crypto</h2>
<p>In July 2021, Trump told Fox Business that he thought Bitcoin looks like a “scam” and <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/former-us-president-donald-trump-bitcoin-looks-like-a-scam/" data-wpel-link="internal">criticized</a> it for competing with the US dollar.</p>
<p>“I want the dollar to be the currency of the world. That’s what I’ve always said,&#8221; he said at the time.</p>
<p>That being the case, Trump was more recently <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/after-bail-release-trump-predicts-the-us-dollar-will-lose-global-dominance/" data-wpel-link="internal">bearish</a> on the U.S. dollar’s status under the Biden administration, warning that its devaluation would lead to its loss of world reserve status.</p>
<p>Unlike Trump, the current Republican party is largely <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/republicans-blast-white-house-for-failure-to-compromise-on-stablecoin-bill/" data-wpel-link="internal">supportive</a> of crypto, with several members of the party pushing for legislation to create a welcoming regulatory framework for the industry.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The team has eliminated the loophole, according to the latest update. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The second-largest decentralized exchange on the newly released Base blockchain &#8211; RocketSwap &#8211; announced eliminating any existing high risks and vulnerabilities a day after sustaining a &#8220;brute force hack of the server&#8221; where the platform stored its private keys.</p>
<p>The RocketSwap team confirmed relinquishing minting rights, which is part of its recovery plan. In a new update, the protocol said it has retained only low-risk rights to allocate new pools. The locked initial liquidity and 80k tokens, on the other hand, have been extended for 1 year.</p>
<ul>
<li>On August 14th, hackers stole $865,000 or 471 Ether from RocketSwap and bridged it from Base to Ethereum, which was <a href="https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1691268504396374016" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">flagged</a> by blockchain security expert, PeckShield.</li>
<li>The entity behind the attack then generated 90 trillion tokens named &#8220;LoveRCKT&#8221; and proceeded to move them to Uniswap, along with 400 ETH.</li>
<li>The platform&#8217;s official <a href="https://twitter.com/RocketSwap_Labs/status/1691398314795929601" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">statement</a> on the attack read,</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A brute force hack of the server was detected. Due to the proxy contract linked to our farm contract, multiple high-risk permissions became vulnerable. This resulted in the unauthorized transfer of the farm’s assets. Immediate steps were taken to shut down the farm and halt further potential risks.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The breach prompted RocketSwap to redeploy a new farm contract by dropping the proxy contract and open-sourcing it on-chain. As part of the emergency program, the DEX announced a new farm in a bid to advance the production reduction plan by 0.075 per block.</li>
<li>Among other things, RocketSwap also revealed its intention to call on the hackers to return the assets.</li>
<li>This was the second project on Coinbase-incubated layer 2 solutions, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbases-base-notches-4th-rank-in-daily-tps-among-layer-2-solutions-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Base,</a> to have suffered an attack.</li>
<li>Earlier this month, another DEX on Base called LeetSwap was drained off 342.5 ETH.</li>
