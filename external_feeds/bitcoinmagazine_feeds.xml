This reduction event is called the bitcoin halving (or “halvening” in some circles). </p><p>When Bitcoin miners successfully find a block of transactions that links a set of new transactions to the previous block of already confirmed transactions, they are rewarded in newly created bitcoin. The bitcoin that is freshly created and awarded to the winning miner with each block is called the block subsidy. This subsidy combined with transaction fees sent by users who pay to get their transaction confirmed is called the block reward. The block subsidy and reward incentivizes the use of computing power to keep the Bitcoin code running.</p><p>When bitcoin was first released to the public, the block subsidy was 50 bitcoin. After the first halving in 2012, this number was reduced to 25 bitcoin, then 12.5 bitcoin in 2016. Most recently, the bitcoin halving occurred on May 11, 2020, with miners currently receiving 6.25 bitcoin per new block.</p><figure>

        <figcaption>Bitcoin issuance gets reduced in half roughly every four years.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>The next halving is coming up in about one year. The exact date will depend on the amount of hash power that joins or leaves the network, as this impacts the speed at which blocks are found. Estimates for the next halving range from late April to early May 2024. After the next halving, the block subsidy will be reduced to 3.125 bitcoin.</p><p>In the past, the bitcoin price rose considerably after the halving, albeit many months after the subsidy was reduced. Every halving cycle, there is a debate about whether or not the halving is priced in. This question considers the fact that the halving is a well-known event and attempts to address if the market would factor this into bitcoin’s exchange rate.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3Njg3OTYzNjIxMDA4Njg1/bitcoin-halving-cycles.png" height="399" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption>The bitcoin price has typically gone through an exponential appreciation after the halving.</figcaption>
    </figure><h3>Long-Term Holder Dynamics</h3><p>Our primary thesis is that the halving leads to a demand-driven event in bitcoin, as market participants become acutely aware of bitcoin’s absolute digital scarcity. This leads to a rapid phase of exchange rate appreciation. This hypothesis is somewhat divergent from the main narrative, which is that a supply-driven event instigates the exponential increase in price because miners earn fewer bitcoin for the same amount of energy expended and put less selling pressure on the market.</p><p>When we look closely at the data, we can see that the supply shock is often already in place — the HODL army has already staked their ground, if you will. On the margin, the reduction of supply hitting the market does make a material difference in the daily market clearing rate, but the increase in price is due to a demand-driven phenomenon that hits an entirely illiquid supply on the sell side with holders who are forged in the depths of the bear market unwilling to part with their bitcoin until price appreciates by approximately an order of magnitude.&nbsp;</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3Njg3OTYzODg5NTEwMTk0/long-term-bitcoin-holders-percentage-of-supply.png" height="349" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption>Trends in long-term holder supply sets the floor and tops of market cycles.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>Statistically speaking, long-term holders are the least likely to sell their bitcoin and the current supply is held tightly by this cohort. The people who were buying and holding bitcoin while the exchange rate was down approximately 80% are now the dominant majority share of the free float supply. </p><p>The halving reinforces the reality of Bitcoin’s supply inelasticity to changing demand. As education and understanding about bitcoin’s superior monetary properties further perpetuate across the world, there will be an influx of demand while its inelastic supply makes the price rise exponentially. It isn’t until a large share of the convicted holders part with a proportion of their previously dormant stash that the exchange rate crashes from a feverish high.</p><p>These holding and spending patterns are very well quantifiable, with an entirely transparent and immutable ledger to document it all.</p><p>We know that the long-term holders are the ones setting the floor in the bear market, but they are also the ones setting tops in bull markets. Many people look to the halving’s supply shock as what drives the increase in price, with miners earning fewer coins while still needing to sell some in order to pay their bills that have remained the same cost in dollar terms (or the local currency terms). We can observe miners’ net position change overlaid with the bitcoin price and see the impact of their accumulation and selling.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3Njg3OTYzODg5NTc1MjEz/bitcoin-miner-net-position-change.png" height="349" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption>Miner net position overlaid with the bitcoin price.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>There is clearly a relationship between the bitcoin price and whether miners are accumulating or selling, but correlation does not equal causation and when we include the behavior of long-term holders, we can see how much larger the tide of holder accumulation and distribution is compared to miner sell pressure. The chart below shows the same miner net position change as above, but overlays it with long-term holder net position change, both measuring the net accumulation and distribution of the two cohorts over a 30-day period, displayed on the same y-axis. When we compare the two, it is difficult to see the miner net position change (red) in relation to the much more prominent position change of long-term holders (blue). While miner sell pressure receives all of the press, the real driver of the bitcoin cycle is the convicted holders, who set the floor with accumulation, compressing the proverbial spring for the next wave of incoming demand.&nbsp;</p><figure>

        <figcaption>Miner net position compared to long-term holder net position demonstrates the difference in scale and affect on the price.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>Long-term holders tend to distribute their coins as bitcoin makes its parabolic rise and then begin reaccumulating after the price corrects. We can look at long-term holder spending habits to see how the change in long-term holder supply is what ultimately helps the price cool off after a parabolic rise.</p><p>On-chain data shows that coins that haven’t moved for over six months currently have an average spend price that stays relatively flat during the entirety of the bear market — compared to the volatility of the market-to-market exchange rate. What occurs during the bear market is simply a reshuffling of the deck: UTXOs are exchanging hands from the speculator to the convicted, from the overleveraged to the ones who have free cash flow.&nbsp;</p><figure>

        <figcaption>Long-term and short-term holder spending price.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>During periods of market frenzy to the upside, the outflow of coins from long-term holders is much larger than the sum of daily issuance, while the opposite can be true in the depths of the bear — holders are absorbing far greater amounts of coins than the sum of new issuance. </p><p>We have been in a net accumulation regime for two years, while wiping out nearly the entire derivative complex in the process. Today’s long-term holders have coins that did not budge during the Three Arrows Capital blowup or the FTX fiasco.&nbsp;</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3Njg3OTYzODg5NjQxMjY2/longshort-term-holder-threshold.png" height="349" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption>The red area of the chart shows a pattern of long-term accumulation.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>To demonstrate just how much conviction long-term holders have in this asset, we can observe coins that haven’t moved for one, two and three years. The chart below shows the percentage of UTXOs that have remained dormant over these timeframes. We can see that 67.02% of bitcoin hasn’t changed hands in one year, 53.39% in two years, and 39.75% in three years. While these aren’t perfect metrics for analyzing HODLer behavior, they show that at the very least there is a significant amount of the total supply that is held by people who have little intention of selling these coins anytime soon.</p><figure>

        <figcaption>The amount of bitcoin supply that hasn't been active for more than one, two and three years is increasing.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>Aside from bitcoin becoming harder to produce at the margin, the halving event’s most likely contribution to bitcoin is the marketing around it. At this point, the predominant majority of the world is familiar with bitcoin, but few understand the radical concept of absolute scarcity. With each halving, the media coverage is larger and more significant. </p><p>Bitcoin stands alone with its algorithmic and fixed monetary policy in a world of arbitrary, bureaucratic fiscal policy gone astray and a never ending stream of debt monetization policies.</p><p>The 2024 halving, less than 52,000 bitcoin blocks away, will again reinforce the narrative of supply inelasticity, while an overwhelming majority of the circulating supply is held by holders who are entirely disinterested in parting with their share.&nbsp;</p><h3>Final Note:</h3><p>Despite the halving’s lessening effect in relative terms after each cycle, the upcoming event will serve as a reality check for the market, particularly for those who begin to feel that they have insufficient exposure to the asset. As the programmatic monetary policy of Bitcoin continues to work exactly as designed, approximately 92% of the terminal supply is already in circulation, and the commencement of yet another supply issuance halving event will only reinforce the narrative of apolitical money and bitcoin’s unique digital scarcity will come into focus more sharply.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>That concludes the excerpt from a recent edition of Bitcoin Magazine PRO. </em><a href="https://bmpro.substack.com/subscribe"><em>Subscribe now</em></a><em> to receive PRO articles directly in your inbox.</em></p><figure>

In other words, whatever is most likely standing in the way of this person being converted.</p><p>Let’s therefore start with the main orange-pilling obstacles, before a solution is presented.</p><h2>Why ‘Selling’ Something As Great As Bitcoin Is So Hard</h2><p>The challenge of orange-pilling newbies boils down to three things, and all three mutually reinforce each other to make it even harder:</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NjY0NjkyNDE0NTIyNjY5/self-reinforcing-newbie-nocoiner-cycle.png" height="678" width="620">

    </figure><p><strong>1. Fiat paradigm blindness mixed with fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD)</strong></p><p>When I prompted it, OpenAI defined “paradigm blindness” as the “inability to recognize or fully understand the assumptions and frameworks that shape one's beliefs, values and actions.”</p><p>Bitcoin is a paradigm-breaking innovation, and it’s therefore hard to truly grasp its value without breaking out of the “comfort zone” of the indoctrinated fiat paradigm.</p><p>A lot of the FUD is generated by this “fear of the unknown,” in addition to the fear of losing money.</p><p><strong>2. The skeptic “power-position” compensation (resistance to being “lectured”).</strong></p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NjY0NjkyNDE0NTg4MjA1/questioning-sources.png" height="372" width="620">

    </figure><p>Nobody likes being in the “submissive” position of being “lectured,” and few are humble enough to admit that they “don’t know” something. </p><p>Any orange-pilling attempt thus creates an equal and opposite force of resistance in them, and this is especially true if you try to convince them in person.</p><p>Remaining “skeptical” gives them the perceived “power position” and “upper hand,” which is why people love to proclaim how “skeptical” they are.</p><p><strong>3. The blind men and the elephant dilemma (the “holistic-understanding killer”).</strong></p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NjY0NjkyNjgyODkzMTA2/the-elephant-problem.png" height="461" width="620">

    </figure><p>If you try to capture the “full elephant” of Bitcoin in your orange-pilling attempt, you will most likely come across as the guy in the meme below:</p><figure>

    </figure><p>As all sales people know, logic and arguments are there to retrospectively rationalize decisions (or reinforce ingrained positions). A true change of mind is always a paradigm shift (small or big), and leaving the comfort zone of the old, ingrained paradigm is always a “leap of faith.” </p><p>Logic alone is seldom a strong enough catalyst and motivator for that to happen. This is why the purely-educational approach seldom is enough to break a newbie's self-reinforcing, fiat-paradigm-blindness, FUD loop.</p><p>In addition, the educational approach takes too long, and it’s too boring/technical for the “instant gratification” fiat mindset. </p><p>What is needed is another semi-conscious force that's equally powerful to FUD; namely fear of missing out (FOMO). If the level of FOMO eclipses and exceeds the level of FUD, people will convert. Simple as that.</p><h2>Making Bitcoin Irresistible To The Fiat-Minded Nocoiner</h2><p>This was always the first question I would ask myself when starting a new sales page copywriting gig:</p><p>“How do I present this offer in a way that’s absolutely, mouthwateringly irresistible to the target audience?”</p><p>The example below clearly illustrates the difference between feature-oriented “education” and “sexy,” benefit-oriented persuasion:</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NjY0NjkyNjgzMDI0MTc4/ipod-marketing.png" height="377" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption><a href="https://vladimirraykov.com/sell-online-courses/"><em>Source</em></a></figcaption>
    </figure><p>Do you see the massive difference in perceived value? </p><p>Boring, educational, feature focus is a classic “rookie mistake” in the world of ad copywriting, and it’s an epidemic in the world of orange pilling. </p><p>It’s easy to believe that people need to “understand” Bitcoin before they would “invest” their hard-earned fiat into it. </p><p>The truth is, however, that Mr. Normie Nocoiner is <em>less</em> likely to “invest” the more you try to make him understand Bitcoin.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>It’s hard to “sell” people on Bitcoin when you focus on the features. </p><p>Paradoxically, Bitcoin sells itself to anyone who <em>does</em> understand it, and the reason why is simple: Bitcoin is the best deal in town. It’s an absolutely, 100% irresistible offer.</p><p>This is why every Bitcoiner is doing everything they can to get their hands on as much bitcoin as humanly possible. The key takeaway here is the “irresistible offer” part.</p><p>There is a massive difference between trying to “educate” normies about Bitcoin, and in presenting Bitcoin as the irresistible offer that it is. </p><p>With that in mind, let’s forget about “peer-to-peer,” “permissionless” and “decentralized” for a moment. Let’s instead dive into:</p><h2>Bitcoin: The Irresistible Offer</h2><p>Normies do not need to be confused by the technical monster that is Bitcoin (repeat that sentence a few times for yourself, and sense the sigh of relief it gives you).</p><p>Nor do they need to understand the history of money, what “sound money” is, or why proof of work is such a big deal.</p><p>Mr. Normie Nocoiner only needs one single thing to “click” in his mind to be orange pilled on the spot, and that is to see a deal that’s irresistible.</p><p>In essence: What will push Mr. Normie Nocoiner to take the “leap of faith” into Bitcoin boils down to three things:</p><ol><li>A clear vision of the deal that a bitcoin “investment” represents (not what Bitcoin “is” or even what it “does”).</li><li>A justified sense of urgency and FOMO.</li><li>A clear understanding of why the deal is so irresistibly good (and why holding zero bitcoin is a far bigger risk than getting off zero).</li></ol><p>Without further ado, here is my ultra-simple orange-pilling formula. It opens with the following question:</p><p>“So, what do you think will happen to the price of bitcoin once a critical mass realizes that Bitcoin mining not only solves global warming, but also the global energy crisis?”</p><p>This flies right in the face of what they’ve most likely been programmed by the media to believe, so it will definitely get their attention and make them curious.</p><p>I then follow up by reminding them that bitcoin has absolute scarcity, and that most of the supply is already in the hands of long-term holders who already understand where this is going.</p><p>You will most likely get tons of resistance when making the above claim about Bitcoin mining, which is good. It clears the space for you to present irrefutable proof elements to back it up.</p><p>You must have these proof elements ready up front, of course, and it’s a good idea to store them on your phone. You will find plenty of ammo in the orange-pilling rabbit hole that I have created over at <a href="https://bitcoinmaxinews.com/">Bitcoin Maxi News</a>.</p><p>Once they see the proof elements of how Bitcoin mining is already being used to mitigate methane emissions (which is far worse than CO2 when it comes to the “greenhouse effect”), and how it balances the grid and incentivizes the buildout of renewable energy, well, at the very least, you’ve given them something to think about.</p><p>You can then repeat the initial question, and remind them that this early-bird opportunity will not last forever. This starts a “ticking FOMO clock” in their mind, as nobody wants to miss out on a great deal.</p><p>Explain that they don’t have to go “all in,” and that owning as little as 0.2 to 0.5 BTC can turn into generational wealth for their family when all this goes mainstream.</p><p>Close by saying that owning zero BTC is the biggest financial risk they can take, and that knowing these things is akin to having fully-legal “insider knowledge” that 98% of the population doesn’t know about — yet.</p><p>With this approach, you avoid all of the technical, confusing and boring stuff, and you present Bitcoin as the sexy and irresistible offer that it is, all within a few minutes’ time.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by SV.

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Matt Maraia, </em><em>a CPA focused on how changes to accounting regulations impact the Bitcoin community.</em></p><p>Today, companies spend egregious amounts of money on credit card fees when processing customer payments, ultimately cutting into margins that are widely scrutinized by investors and management alike. </p><p>But the Lightning Network presents a new payment solution with the ability to process instantaneous payments (using Bitcoin) for virtually no fees. It boasts equivalent decentralized safeguards to the Bitcoin network, ultimately using Bitcoin’s blockchain, which has not been hacked since its inception in 2009. While doubt among the general public about bitcoin manifests itself in the asset’s price volatility, this innovative technology built on top of “Bitcoin rails” poses a unique opportunity for CEOs and CFOs to improve profitability. </p><p>In fact, you can be anti-Bitcoin and still be able to extract the advantages of the Lightning Network into your company’s payment processes, avoiding the issues of bitcoin price variability. </p><p>Here are some of the biggest advantages of adopting the Lightning Network for businesses:</p><h2>Improving Margins, Reducing Fees </h2><p>With<a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/jenny-craig-planning-mass-layoffs-shutting-down-weight-loss-centers"> mass layoffs</a> circulating the market, investors and managers understandably continue to scrutinize margins — every dollar matters and can spell disaster without proper planning and foresight. </p><p>The Lightning Network helps to alleviate these pressures by way of minimal transaction fees. On average, payments made via credit card amount to <a href="https://thepaymentsassociation.org/article/bitcoin-lightning-as-a-payment-rail/">about 3% in fees</a> owed to intermediary financial institutions. The Lightning Network opens up the possibility to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-lightning-network-is-1-000x-cheaper-than-visa-and-mastercard-data">process payments at a fraction of the cost</a> by using micropayment channels. While it is unlikely that an entire customer base will immediately transact through the Lightning Network, even transitioning 25% of credit card payments could significantly improve margins. </p><h2>Benefitting From Consistent Innovation </h2><p>Without delving into the superfluous details of how Lightning operates behind the scenes, the innovations materializing in the space remain frequent. </p><p>For example, <a href="https://www.ibexpay.io/">IBEX Pay</a> operates as a web application service that allows merchants to create an invoice on demand, generate a QR code to be scanned by the buyer with any Lightning wallet and process payment via Lightning instantaneously. Merchants can opt to receive payment based on the user-designated ratio of BTC to USD. </p><p>For companies with point-of-sale (PoS) terminals, S<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/industry-events/jack-mallers-adding-bitcoin-to-major-pos-networks">trike is developing Lightning Network compatibility for many of those</a> while offering similar benefits to the IBEX Pay platform in both efficiency and cost effectiveness. And most of these services do not require monthly subscription fees. </p><h2>Instant Settlement </h2><p>Another benefit of using the Lightning Network is a near-immediate settlement of funds. No longer are companies required to wait two to three business days for ACH/wire payments to settle to access capital via “fiat rails.” Intermediaries are removed with the use of the Lightning Network, permitting fast access to capital while limiting counterparty risk. </p><h2>A Built-In Customer Base </h2><p>Although customer bases are highly dependent on the goods or services offered by a company, there is a large contingent of Bitcoin supporters who prefer and often seek out vendors that operate directly or indirectly within the Bitcoin environment. </p><p>Many Bitcoin advocates use websites such as <a href="https://btcmap.org/">btcmap.org</a> and <a href="https://satmap.app/">satmap.app</a> to find businesses that accept bitcoin. Given that the Lightning Network is a layer built on top of the Bitcoin network, adopting it can provide you with an ever-growing, built-in customer base that is hungry to contribute to and share the successes of businesses operating under the Bitcoin umbrella. </p><h2>Limitations And Risks</h2><p>Still, the relative infancy of the Lightning Network means there are potential limitations and risks. </p><p>For instance, IBEX Pay <a href="https://www.ibexpay.io/support">currently offers a maximum $2,500 transaction size</a>. Additionally, and as with any new technology, while the network is gaining traction, there are still potential risks with bugs and other vulnerabilities. Recent traction in popularity has helped to lessen concerns over this proof of concept, but without decades of data points to lean on, there is no guarantee issues will not emerge. Lastly, a current lack of regulatory clarity in the digital asset realm could potentially lead to more questions later. </p><p>With all that said, the Lightning Network provides companies with a competitive advantage from a financial, operational and technological standpoint, though there are some concerns due to the relative infancy of the product in addition to existing limitations in current solutions. However, rather than standing by and suffering through the oncoming margin pressures that continue to infiltrate the economy, it is worthwhile to take action and adapt. </p><p>My recommendation for business owners out there is to trial run implementing this solution for at least a small segment of your business and to build out enough of a sample size to compare to current payment processes. What’s the worst-case scenario here? You are not reaping the benefits outlined herein, but you are without collateral damage to your business. The best? You are a first mover in a technology that aims to interrupt the payment processing space, coupled with increasing margins and gaining quicker access to customer payments. </p><p>The decision is yours. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Matt Maraia.

Davidoff plans to travel to Indonesia to teach the very first course in the country.</p><p>"The goal of this course is to provide a hands-on approach to serve as an introduction course to allow for the student to obtain strong fundamentals in one of the fastest growing emerging technologies today," Davidoff explained. "This course is also suitable to be used as a springboard to a vocational school or apprenticeship/journeymen as an electrician or HVAC technician."</p><p>Students who complete the course will receive a "Blockchain Technician Certificate," which can be used to secure a job in a network operations center, a cryptocurrency mining farm, or as an elective to continue their college career in cybersecurity, programming or management of systems.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg5Njg3Mjc4MTQwOTI1NzA1/screen-shot-2022-05-23-at-95610-am.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NzE2NTQ1NTU0NjIxNzQx/image.jpg" height="465" width="620" medium="image" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[North Carolina House Passes Bill Prohibiting State Payments With CBDCs]]></title><description><![CDATA[Now headed to the state Senate, HB690 rectifies language that previously encompassed Bitcoin in its goal of restricting CBDC usage.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/north-carolina-house-passes-bill-banning-cbdc-payments</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/north-carolina-house-passes-bill-banning-cbdc-payments</guid><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cbdcs]]></category><category><![CDATA[Legal]]></category><category><![CDATA[Legislation]]></category><category><![CDATA[North Carolina]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 04 May 2023 21:25:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzOTk5NDg5MTkzODEzNTA5/bitcoin-domino.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>The North Carolina House of Representatives has unanimously passed <a href="https://www.ncleg.gov/Sessions/2023/Bills/House/PDF/H690v3.pdf">House Bill 690</a>, which prohibits the use of central bank digital currencies (CBDC) for payments to the state or any participation by the state in Federal Reserve branch testing of CBDC.

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Jason Maier, a teacher and author of “A Progressive’s Case For Bitcoin.” Disclaimer: This book was published by Bitcoin Magazine.</em></p><p>Does Bitcoin need progressives?</p><p>The simple answer to this question is no, Bitcoin doesn’t need progressives. We can all quote the memes by heart: Bitcoin doesn’t care. Tick tock, next block. Bitcoin is inevitable. Bitcoin can’t be regulated. I believe each of these mottos are true, in their own ways, in the long term. But recently, I have devoted a lot of energy to answering the converse of this question, namely: Do progressives need Bitcoin? </p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Progressives-Case-Bitcoin-Equitable-Peaceful/dp/B0C1J3DC2X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=BHMKM398V21S&amp;keywords=a+progressive%27s+case+for+bitcoin&amp;qid=1683039479&amp;sprefix=a+progressi%2Caps%2C92&amp;sr=8-1">My book</a> answers this more intricate question thoroughly in the affirmative. And while it’s easy to conclude, with confidence, that Bitcoin doesn’t <em>need</em> progressives, it might be interesting to consider why you should care at all that I’m on a mission to orange pill as many progressive liberals as I can. It’s true that Bitcoin doesn’t care. But I think you should.</p><h2>Shortening The Long Run</h2><p>As clear as it is to me that Bitcoin will ultimately succeed, it is also clear that the support of liberals and those on the left of the political spectrum, while not an absolute necessity, is important nonetheless. Even if Bitcoin is inevitable in the long run, there is an awful lot of time between now and the end of that long run. That time can be filled with growing adoption, innovation and promoting freedom money across the planet. Or that time can be filled with political fighting at every level of every government across the globe. Plenty of people reading this may not care, or they may even welcome the fighting. But in the long run, I’ll be dead and the world would be a better place if more people understood and used Satoshi Nakamoto’s innovation before my stack of corn gets passed along to my children. </p><p>There are Bitcoiners who do not align with me politically, but nonetheless support my work. These folks like to remind me that Bitcoin is money for enemies. This is not only true, but actually an important property of all “good” money. Furthermore, it is also critical to remember that, in this narrow sense, no Bitcoiner is your enemy, regardless of how they align themselves within the legacy political system. While left and right may fight about everything else, it is imperative that we unite when it comes to Bitcoin, because doing so provides our best opportunity to replace our current system <em>before</em> the end of the long term. </p><h2>Overhaul The System</h2><p>Like many people, my vision of bitcoin is that it is money for everyone. I also see it as the best tool we have to replace the corrupt, opaque and regressive global financial system which we have all inherited. At some point, the people who control the current system will actually start to fight Bitcoin and when they do, they will fight hard. The<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/02/28/1069190/ethereum-moved-to-proof-of-stake-why-cant-bitcoin/"> current environmental fear,uncertainty and doubt (FUD)</a> and the recent closing of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/banks-are-breaking-up-with-crypto-during-regulatory-crackdown-22de1832">fiat onramps to crypto exchanges</a> will look quaint in comparison. Powerful interests from Washington, D.C., to High Street will be able to pull their levers to make it difficult for any non-expert to learn about bitcoin, gain access to it or store it securely. Each of the players in the current game are incentivized to keep it running as long as possible and they have access to tremendous resources to help make that happen. Perhaps, for the first time, the issue isn’t powerful interests trying to make more money, it is the very definition of money itself. It will be a war and they will pull out all the stops.</p><p>Some Bitcoiners confidently claim that Bitcoin bans don’t matter because people are able to move to places where Bitcoin isn’t banned. If Bitcoin becomes illegal in some countries, or even some states within the U.S., we might have a chance to see how difficult jurisdictional arbitrage is in practice. Those with wealth and connections may be able to move to a different country that embraces Bitcoin. Those struggling to get by will be left behind. Even <a href="https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/wbd588-ted-cruz">Ted Cruz was dismissive</a> of the idea when he quipped to a Bitcoin audience recently, “How many folks here have your El Salvadoran passports?” </p><p>I don’t often agree with Cruz, but he is right. It’s hard to see how the emergency plan of everyone moving to El Salvador can fulfill the promise that “Bitcoin is for everybody” within my lifetime. </p><p>But perhaps the goal of those currently in power won’t be to make Bitcoin illegal, but instead to just keep us fighting about it from our entrenched and polarized political viewpoints. Since their goal is to protect the current system, they likely won’t start by outlawing their competition, but instead they would just keep people arguing about it. </p><p>The best outcome for those seeking to maintain the status quo is for the public to see Bitcoin as a right versus left issue, something else to divide people while those in charge continue to benefit from the current systems. And there is every reason to think that this will happen. Currently, there are a small number of <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/02/14/elizabeth-warren-anti-crypto-ftx-00082624">liberal politicians who regularly attempt to win political points by bashing Bitcoin</a>. If the tactic proves successful over time, others will add their voices to the chorus. On the flip side, some conservative legislators have rushed not only to support Bitcoin, but also highlight that the politicians on the left don’t. Eventually, all of the FUD, roadblocks and political fighting could reach a crescendo, at which point Bitcoin would start feeling a lot less inevitable.</p><h2>Make The War Impossible</h2><p>The window to get in front of this narrative is small and rapidly closing. My strong belief is that the secret to our collective success isn’t in convincing the politicians in power that Bitcoin is a force for good, but instead it’s in educating the citizens that vote for those politicians. We still have a chance to do so. Most pre-coiners just haven’t thought about Bitcoin a lot. I have seen that once people are given an opportunity to learn and ask questions, they are often convinced of Bitcoin’s value proposition. However the converse can also be true. If we get to the point where the government tries to ban Bitcoin, there will likely be a large swath of the population that will conclude that it must be bad. If public sentiment turns from “bitcoin is pretend money” to “Bitcoin is a bad thing for bad people,” it will be hard to unring that bell. Such an outcome doesn’t make Bitcoin’s success any less likely in the long run, but it can push back adoption, innovation, the building of infrastructure and education by decades. This would not only lock us in an outdated system, but also delay the real-life benefits that Bitcoin offers to the people who need this technology now. </p><p>Because of Bitcoin’s superior monetary properties, it will eventually win and become a preferred method of storing and transferring value among the world’s citizens. We know those currently in power are incentivized to fight Bitcoin. If given the chance, they will. But, even though we could win their war, we still have an opportunity to make such a war politically impossible in the first place. Doing so should be considered an imperative. <a href="https://www.swanbitcoin.com/ten-million-bitcoiners-the-intransigent-minority/">Cory Klippsten makes a similar argument</a>, employing <a href="https://medium.com/incerto/the-most-intolerant-wins-the-dictatorship-of-the-small-minority-3f1f83ce4e15">Nassim Taleb’s framework</a> of “The Intransigent Minority.” Klippsten’s claim is that if Bitcoin reaches 10 million supporters in the United States, that small but unmoving minority will make it practically impossible to fight the technology.</p><p>Even if imperfect, the schematic holds some intuitive value. Let’s say for the sake of argument that Klippsten’s 10 million number is correct. It would be foolish to think that we will reach that goal (in “<a href="https://www.swanbitcoin.com/the-race-to-avoid-the-war/">The Race To Avoid The War</a>”) without intentionally expanding the scope of our target audience. So far, progressives remain a fairly-untapped option for such an expansion. Further, our coalition of 10 million will be stronger and more antifragile if it is heterogeneous across the political spectrum. A robust coalition of Bitcoiners that spans the political spectrum will be impossible to ignore and harder to fight. This is why I, and many others like me, are bringing the case for Bitcoin to progressive people however we can. I think that should matter to you.</p><h2>Bitcoin Doesn’t Care, But You Should</h2><p>The world needs us to orange pill progressives. I very much want to reach Klippsten’s 10 million target and see the intransigent minority of Bitcoiners shape the future of money. The good news is that there is a growing catalog of Bitcoin educational resources offered through a progressive lens. There is also a growing and vocal progressive community within the Bitcoin space. Thanks to these tools, we have an opportunity, however fleeting, to reach more people and convince them of Bitcoin’s promise. And we need your help. </p><p>This is a call to action. Don’t shy away from conversations about Bitcoin with a liberal colleague, in-law or neighbor. Try to reach those people where they are and explain how Bitcoin addresses the unfairness they care about in the current system. Many progressives will respond well to an informed discussion about how and why Bitcoin addresses wealth inequality or gives property rights to marginalized groups of people. You may have more success than you think. If you’re unable to convince them yourself, direct them to appropriate books, podcasts and articles so they can continue their learning. </p><p>There is no doubt that we will eventually reach the tipping point when Bitcoin becomes inevitable. When that happens, it will be critical to have a variety of political ideologies represented in our coalition if we are to find the greatest success. The only unknown that remains is if we will act quickly enough to reach that tipping point before the war. I am optimistic that we will, and to that end I will continue to orange pill as many progressives as I can. I hope you will join me in that work.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Jason Maier.

    </figure><p>Bitdeer Technologies Group and Druk Holding &amp; Investments have partnered to develop a 100% carbon-free digital asset mining operation in the Kingdom of Bhutan. According to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, the partnership aims to help accelerate Bhutan's digital transformation and economic diversification, while expanding Bitdeer's global footprint. The two firms will establish a closed-end fund worth up to $500 million, which will launch in May 2023. Bitdeer will serve as the general partner, while DHI will act as a strategic limited partner.</p><p>“The Partnership is expected to create local jobs in areas ranging from engineering to project management, supervisory and supportive functions,” the press release said. “At the same time, the Partnership is expected to generate economic activity and foreign-currency-denominated revenue for local communities and the country.”</p><p>Bitdeer's Chairman, Jihan Wu, said, "We are excited to be working alongside DHI in accessing Bhutan's zero-emissions power to sustainably enable the blockchain technologies that will eventually form an immutable bedrock for a global store of value." <br><br>“We are thrilled to partner with Bitdeer on this important development for DHI.” Ujjwal Deep Dahal, CEO of Druk Holding and Investments, commented. "DHI exists for the betterment of the lives of Bhutanese people today and for generations to follow."</p><p>Bitdeer currently operates data centers in Northern Europe and North America. As the press release notes, the upcoming carbon-free bitcoin mining operation in Bhutan will mark a crucial expansion into Asia for Bitdeer, which “will enable Bitdeer to tap into Asia's abundant resources, contributing to the flourishing regional ecosystem.”</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgyMDU1MzM1MTk5MDU3MDI3/bitcoin-numbers.jpg"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[North Carolina County Enacts One-Year Ban On Commercial Bitcoin Mining, But Not Without Pushback]]></title><description><![CDATA[After a public hearing, Buncombe County voted to approve a moratorium on bitcoin mining in order to craft zoning standards and regulations for special land use.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/north-carolina-county-enacts-one-year-ban-on-bitcoin-mining</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/north-carolina-county-enacts-one-year-ban-on-bitcoin-mining</guid><category><![CDATA[Mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[Ban]]></category><category><![CDATA[Regulation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Legal]]></category><category><![CDATA[Legislation]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Craig Deutsch]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 03 May 2023 17:35:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgzMjM5NTgzMDQyMTE4Njk0/img_6164.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

Commissioners approved the one-year ban after holding a public hearing during their meeting on May 2. The County’s current ordinances do not define cryptocurrency mining as a specific use. Cryptocurrency mining operations can negatively affect surrounding neighborhoods due to excessive energy use, e-waste, pollution, and noise. The temporary pause will help protect the public interest until regulations regarding cryptocurrency mining are adopted. The one-year ban is effective immediately through May 1, 2024.”</p></blockquote><figure>

Fedi seeks to empower individuals to collaborate through "federations" made up of friends, families, neighbors, nonprofit organizations, social clubs, businesses, conferences and other forms of community to take control of their money, data and digital lives while protecting user privacy and autonomy. <br><br>The open-source Fedimint protocol, on which Fedi is built, makes it easy for developers to build additional apps and modules to complement Fedi's offerings and give more options to users. “It provides a resilient, privacy-protecting, and simple way for people who don’t have access to or don’t trust centralized alternatives to secure and use their data and money,” a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine explained.</p><p>The financing round was led by Ego Death Capital, with participation from Block, Kingsway, Trammell Venture Partners and Timechain, among others. This funding brings Fedi's total funding to $21.21 million. Fedi CEO Obi Nwosu said that the interest in the round allowed them to select investors that are fully aligned with the future they are trying to create with Fedi.</p><p>Fedi's community or "second-party" custody model offers a secure alternative to third-party cryptocurrency exchanges, cloud backup services and encrypted messaging apps. The system's underlying technology is readymade for rapid expansion and can be adapted to do virtually all the things people currently use their smartphone or computer to do. The system aims to answer the security, privacy and trust deficiencies of current alternatives, bringing users benefits similar to self-custody without technical or financial barriers to entry. </p><p>“Fedi is offering a truly decentralized and federated way not only to custody bitcoin but to take back control of everything that matters in your digital life,” said Jeff Booth, co-founder of Ego Death Capital and lead investor for this series. “It’s hard to overstate what this combination of technologies makes possible, and while I expect Fedi to be at the forefront, I’m just as excited by what people are going to build around it.

    </figure><p>The President's new budget proposal for Fiscal Year 2024 includes the Digital Asset Mining Energy (DAME) excise tax, which would require bitcoin mining firms to pay 30% of the cost of electricity used for mining crypto assets. This tax aims to address what the White House claims are the economic and environmental costs of mining, citing local pollution, increased greenhouse gas emissions and higher energy prices.</p><p>Unfortunately, the proposal does not take into account the large mix of renewable energy sources being used to power bitcoin mining, which <a href="https://bitcoinminingcouncil.com/bitcoin-mining-electricity-mix-increased-to-59-5-sustainable-in-q2-2022/">Bitcoin Mining Council research</a> shows continues to grow, making up more than half of the energy utilized by miners. In addition, it does not consider the grid-strengthening benefits that Bitcoin mining can offer, which has been <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/12/06/texas-bitcoin-miners-are-offered-to-cut-electricity-usage-to-help-the-grid/">seen</a> in states like <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-mining-fits-texas-energy-grid">Texas</a>. </p><p>The recent announcement of the DAME tax is yet another example of government overreach and intervention in the private sector. The proposal is just another tax grab by the government, disguised as an effort to address environmental concerns.</p><p>While it is true that mining consumes energy, it is not the responsibility of the government to dictate how businesses operate or what is a good and bad use of energy. The government should not be punishing businesses for pursuing innovation and technological advancement. The DAME tax is nothing more than a blatant attempt to stifle innovation in the Bitcoin industry and limit the potential for economic growth.</p><p>Furthermore, the government's claim that Bitcoin mining imposes costs on others is unfounded. Bitcoin mining firms already pay for the electricity they use, and any negative externalities are mitigated by the fact that they often locate in areas with excess or <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/renewable-energy">renewable</a> energy. The argument that mining firms impose costs on low-income neighborhoods and communities of color is simply fearmongering and lacks any empirical evidence.</p><p>In fact, the DAME tax could have negative consequences for these same communities. The tax could cause firms to move their operations overseas, resulting in job losses and decreased economic activity in the United States. Moreover, the tax could create risks for local electrical grids who now benefit from the increased production and instant shut-off ability of miners. </p><p>It is clear that the government is targeting the mining industry because it is a new and innovative technology that is disrupting traditional financial systems.</p><p>The DAME tax is a misguided attempt by the government to stifle innovation in the Bitcoin industry and generate revenue under the guise of environmental protection. The tax is hypocritical, lacks any empirical evidence and could have negative unintended consequences for communities and consumers. The government should focus on creating a regulatory environment that supports innovation and economic growth, rather than imposing arbitrary taxes on businesses.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgyMzg4OTgzNTU5NDk3MDMy/usa.jpg"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[MoonPay Launches App In More Than 130 Countries]]></title><description><![CDATA[MoonPay is now offering its multi-wallet management solution via the app store in countries across the globe.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/moonpay-launches-app-in-more-than-130-countries</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/moonpay-launches-app-in-more-than-130-countries</guid><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Moonpay]]></category><category><![CDATA[app]]></category><category><![CDATA[Wallets]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 03 May 2023 15:37:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg5ODc3NDQ5NjI5MTE2MTU4/20220531_btcfinal_best-make-your-ln-node-mobile---anthony-feliciano.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Carlos Cárdenas, an institutional account manager who has worked at legacy banks and cryptocurrency exchanges.</em></p><p>Argentina is on the verge of financial collapse as record inflation and Argentine peso (ARS) devaluation hits the market. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/steve_hanke/status/1650492285539471360?s=20">research</a> from Steve Hanke, a professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University, the peso has depreciated 47% against the U.S. dollar (UD) and inflation is running higher than <a href="https://twitter.com/steve_hanke/status/1647792706725490688">118%</a> per year. His solution: dollarize the Argentine economy. </p><p>While dollarization is already in play in Argentina to some extent (many Argentinians save in dollars and accept dollars at their businesses) the peso is still the de facto currency of the country. The <a href="https://bluedollar.net/informal-rate/">Dólar Blue</a> rate, an informal measure of the cost of buying and selling a physical dollar bill in Argentina, has risen 23 times since 2018. At the time of this writing, it sits at 465 ARS to 1 USD. Factors such as the rising costs of living, bad economic practices and the COVID-19 pandemic have led to this outcome for Argentina. </p><p>Pundits, politicians and local citizens are advocating for full-fledged dollarization as the solution, but is this the best method, or can we find something better? Given the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/as-banks-collapse-bitcoin-is-stronger">inherent problems with the USD</a>, perhaps a hybrid approach that implements the superior qualities of Bitcoin, could serve Argentina better.</p><h2>A Case Study In Ecuador</h2><p>To analyze this, let's take a look at Ecuador, which was one of the first Latin American countries to leave its national currency, the sucre, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998%E2%80%931999_Ecuador_economic_crisis">adopt U.S. dollars in 1999</a>. </p><p>By the end of 1999, <a href="https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/The-Case-of-Ecuador.pdf">inflation in Ecuador had reached 60%</a> and the sucre had <a href="https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_emp/documents/publication/wcms_364613.pdf">devalued by about 300%</a>. To prevent bank failures, the government <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998%E2%80%931999_Ecuador_economic_crisis">shut down banks and started to “rescue” the financial system</a>. As expected, this did not work and not only did poverty explode in the country, but the monetary base expanded by <a href="https://fee.org/articles/celebrating-ecuador-s-dollarization/#:~:text=Ecuador%20entered%20dollarization%20under%20a,of%20devaluation%20exceeded%20300%20percent.">552%</a>. Consequently, Ecuadorian citizens abandoned the sucre and, by 2000, the government officially adopted the U.S. dollar as legal tender. The short-term consequences for dollarization were dire: people lost their entire lives’ savings, some committed suicide and many left the country to work in the United States and in Europe. That immediate cost caused the government to collapse and the country to suffer a depression that, eventually, it recovered from.</p><p>Fast forward and, as a result of dollarization, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2536238">the real GDP of Ecuador grew by 75% in total from 2000 to 2013, while the inflation and interest rates dropped</a>. This might have seemed like a happy ending, but due to corruption and mismanagement of resources, the full economic potential of Ecuador was never realized and <a href="https://www.heritage.org/index/country/ecuador#:~:text=Ecuador's%20economic%20freedom%20score%20is,the%20world%20and%20regional%20averages.">today it has a below-average economy</a>. </p><p>Dollarization was very successful in Ecuador, such that it continuously posed a threat to politicians and central bankers. They no longer had the power to manipulate a currency so, with the inspiration of blockchain technology, came up with a program to develop a central bank digital currency (CBDC) through a fintech program called “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666143821000107">Dinero Electrónico</a>” between 2014 and 2018. Because there were no effective data controls, this program allowed the government to print more dollars and allow users to transact via their phones, thus creating a currency that operated in parallel to the dollar. This added to privacy concerns and a lack of trust that drove the program to crash and burn.</p><h2>Lessons Learned For Argentina</h2><p>Seeing the initial success of the U.S. dollar in Ecuador, I do believe dollarization is the most prudent way that Argentina can go about fixing its monetary policy. However, Argentina can also officialize bitcoin as legal tender in order to reduce the immediate shock to the economy, modernize its financial system and offer its citizens alternatives. </p><p>Mere years ago, Bitcoin was non-existent. Today, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">Bitcoin has a market cap of well over $500 billion dollars</a> and it is leveraged by sovereign wealth funds, hedge funds, insurance firms, tech firms and retail users all across the globe. And while institutional adoption grows, so do business opportunities across borders. Bitcoin’s Lightning Network is now <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-lightning-network-is-1-000x-cheaper-than-visa-and-mastercard-data">1,000 times cheaper</a> to use than major credit card providers like Visa or Mastercard. The potential for businesses relying on international capital and remittances would be huge and bring trust to the country. </p><p>Argentina also already has one of the higher indices of crypto adoption in Latin America, with <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/latin-america-cryptocurrency-geography-report-2022-preview/">over 31%</a> of the retail-sized crypto transactions being conducted with stablecoins, a way for citizens to protect themselves from the ARS inflation. In addition, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/20/world/americas/argentina-cryptocurrency-value.html">over 60% of Argentinians</a> believe that BTC has capabilities as a store of value with the power to outperform the peso. </p><p>Most recently, Argentina’s Comisión Nacional de Valores, its national securities commission, authorized the launch of a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/04/12/argentinas-national-securities-commission-approves-bitcoin-futures/">bitcoin futures contract</a> that settles in ARS. In addition, bitcoin is up <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/BTC-ARS?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiE2t_-2cz-AhVohIkEHdKCCv8Q-fUHegQIFxAf&amp;window=YTD">105% year to date, as quoted in Argentine pesos</a>, reflecting the conviction that both citizens and the government have in the orange coin. </p><p>There are many challenges that could slow down Bitcoin adoption in Argentina, such as the lack of infrastructure or regulatory clarity. Nonetheless, with a population that is already highly educated in crypto assets and in need of a lifeboat, Bitcoin-hybrid dollarization might prove to be a better experience than Ecuador’s. In addition, incorporation of Bitcoin adoption would deliver a better social contract between the government and its citizens. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Carlos Cárdenas.

    </figure><h2>Natural Gas Prices At The Waha Hub</h2><p>Approximately <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=53499">70% of Mexico’s natural gas imports</a> are supplied by U.S. pipelines. Therefore, it is common for natural gas contracts in Mexico to be <a href="https://www.naturalgasintel.com/pipeline-natural-gas-exports-to-mexico-rising-as-infrastructure-comes-online/">linked to locations in the U.S.</a> where pricing is determined, such as the Waha hub, Henry hub and Houston Ship Channel.</p><p><a href="https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Texas-Natural-Gas-Prices-Sink-Close-To-Zero.html">The Waha hub is one of the most important pricing point for natural gas in Mexico</a>, in part because each of the Wahalajara pipelines jointly operated by Carso Energy and Energy Transfer <a href="https://tppetconnect.energytransfer.com/ipost/TPP/capacity/design-capacity-for-intrastates">are designed</a> to <a href="https://pipelines.energytransfer.com/ipost/CTP/capacity/design-capacity-for-intrastates">transport</a> and sell over 1 billion of cubic feet of natural gas per day to Mexico’s state-owned Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE) power plants.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gob.mx/cre/documentos/precios-de-gasolinas-y-diesel?idiom=es">natural gas price index for the Mexican market</a>, known as the IPGN, is <a href="https://www.naturalgasintel.com/mexicos-cre-to-publish-natural-gas-prices-for-six-regions/">calculated with the Waha benchmark price by</a> the Comisión Reguladora de Energía (CRE), a government energy regulatory commission. Carso Energy’s transport income generally benefits from higher prices at the Waha hub. The CRE uses the Waha benchmark to calculate a daily reference price for natural gas used by CFE, which helps determine the price of natural gas <a href="https://elcapitalino.mx/nacion/cfe-principal-factor-para-el-crecimiento-de-carso-energy/">sold to the CFE by Carso Energy</a>, including the midstream costs of transportation and other fees associated with importing natural gas. The <a href="https://www.naturalgasintel.com/cfe-alliances-driving-mexico-natural-gas-infrastructure-growth-as-imports-cool-off/">CFE is one of the largest customers of natural gas in Mexico</a> and by the end of next year, the CFE is expected to generate <a href="https://mexicobusiness.news/energy/news/cfe-generate-65-energy-2024-lopez-obrador">65% of Mexico’s power</a>. Selling natural gas to the CFE can become extremely profitable during severe weather events in Texas, due to <a href="https://mexicobusiness.news/energy/news/cfe-embroiled-us400-million-legal-dispute-goldman-sachs">heavily-inflated spikes</a> in the Waha benchmark price.</p><p>Severe weather events aside, the Waha hub has been plagued with takeaway capacity constraints, causing record low prices in the Waha benchmark of natural gas that have <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=53919">consistently fallen below the Henry hub</a> in Erath, Louisiana. The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) primarily uses the <a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/ng_pri_fut_s1_d.htm">Henry hub price for natural gas futures</a> contracts. Physical supply and demand dynamics at the Waha hub can have effects that influence the Henry hub and NYMEX natural gas futures. The Wahalajara pipelines had been <a href="https://www.ogj.com/general-interest/article/14180425/us-gas-exports-to-mexico-to-rise-with-wahalajara-completion">expected to help narrow the steep Waha hub discount</a> to the Henry hub, however, the Waha benchmark still went <a href="https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Texas-Natural-Gas-Prices-Sink-Close-To-Zero.html">negative 20 times in the last three years</a> due to other factors that <a href="https://btuanalytics.com/natural-gas-pricing/can-el-paso-south-pipeline-save-waha-from-negative-outright-pricing/">remain an issue</a>.</p><p>Negative pricing at the Waha hub can occur when there is an <a href="https://aegis-hedging.com/insights/waha-basis-forces-affecting-price-aegis-reference">oversupply of natural gas and not enough pipeline capacity to transport the gas</a>. When this happens, producers may be forced to pay buyers to take their natural gas in order to avoid having to entirely shut down production. This can lead to negative pricing, which can present a number of challenges for Waha pipelines.</p><blockquote><p>“Waha is in the Permian basin, and is characterized as a market that is perpetually long supply, and needs to trade at a discount to its marginal demand market. That demand market is almost always outside of the Permian basin. Therefore, basis is determined by the amount of excess gas that needs to be moved to another location. The relative abundance or scarcity of this egress capacity influences Waha basis greatly…</p><p>“On a daily basis, wind generation directly competes with natural gas. As new wind (and solar) farms are constructed, renewable energy sources are taking a larger share of total generation. If renewables generation grows faster than load (demand for power), then gas demand generally suffers.”</p><p>–<a href="https://aegis-hedging.com/insights/waha-basis-forces-affecting-price-aegis-reference">“Waha Basis: Forces Affecting Price,” AEGIS Reference</a>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><h2>Bitcoin Mining Competes With Natural Gas Pipelines</h2><p>Low prices reduce the incentive for producers to sell natural gas in the Waha market, which in turn can lead to lower throughput volumes for the Wahalajara pipelines. Shale oil wells in the Permian Basin <a href="https://www.resilience.org/stories/2020-02-25/to-manys-dismay-permian-produces-more-gas-and-condensate-instead-of-oil-and-profits/">have become extremely gassy</a> — producing more <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/glossary/index.php?id=A#ass_diss_nat_gas">associated natural gas</a> as they age and oil production falls. This results in increased exploration for shale oil, which <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-producers-are-setting-billions-of-dollars-on-fire-11578652210">results in more gassy wells</a> and an oversupply of natural gas. As prices stay low, or go negative, it becomes more profitable to waste natural gas by either venting it or flaring it.</p><p>Venting methane is harmful for the environment as it is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/12/climate/texas-methane-super-emitters.html">a potent greenhouse gas</a> that traps <a href="https://www.edf.org/climate/methane-crucial-opportunity-climate-fight">80 times more heat than carbon dioxide (CO2)</a> over a 20-year period. Flaring is better than venting, but is only <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/flaring-emissions">92% efficient</a>, meaning that 8% of all flared methane still escapes into the atmosphere. </p><p>Bitcoin mining is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/12/23-year-old-texans-made-4-million-mining-bitcoin-off-flared-natural-gas.html">nearly 100% efficient</a> at <a href="https://www.weforum.org/videos/this-start-up-catches-waste-methane-to-power-data-centres">mitigating methane emissions</a>, so it's <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-producers-are-setting-billions-of-dollars-on-fire-11578652210">more ecologically sound and profitable to mine Bitcoin</a> with methane from stranded Permian Basin wells than it is to waste it. Bitcoin miners can even be used to <a href="https://www.satoshiaction.io/orphaned-wells">reduce fugitive emissions from abandoned oil wells</a> once the wells are no longer productive. Ultimately, this all means there is less incentive to build expensive infrastructure to transport Permian natural gas to the Waha hub where it may sell for practically nothing.</p><p>This is a major problem for operators of the Wahalajara pipeline system. Midstream companies such as Carso Energy and Energy Transport grow profits by increasing the volume and value of transported natural gas. The oil and gas industry has concluded that costs have to rise because <a href="https://www.resilience.org/stories/2020-02-25/to-manys-dismay-permian-produces-more-gas-and-condensate-instead-of-oil-and-profits/">the current cost structure is unsustainable</a> as losses for natural gas explorers <a href="https://ieefa.org/articles/ieefa-update-bankruptcies-multiply-fracking-sector">continue to mount</a>.</p><h2>Bitcoin Mining Competes With Natural Gas Peaker Plants</h2><p><br>To make matters more challenging for the oil and gas industry, research indicates that using large, flexible loads, such as Bitcoin mining operations, can have a net <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4347220">decarbonizing effect</a> on grids over the long term. This is believed to happen when loads balance fluctuations in variable renewable generation, which in turn <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364032114005504">facilitates higher penetrations of renewable resources</a> when those power sources are available.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Brad Jones, the former interim CEO of ERCOT, has <a href="https://youtu.be/gKnRfDeFgr0">publicly affirmed that Bitcoin mining</a> has already played a major role in bringing renewables into the Texas grid, by supporting the financials of solar and wind facilities, and providing a balancing effect between consumers and excess generation that would otherwise be negatively priced or curtailed.</p><blockquote><p>“For many years, ERCOT had been looking for loads of scale that could respond in a demand responsive way that can help us balance our grid... It's here now. And it's a great thing for helping us to manage the grid. Helping us to manage our resources. Bitcoin has the nature of really turning down when prices begin to rise, in a way that we can give that power back to other consumers. And at the same time, as we bring more and more renewables into the state, it becomes a driver of more renewables. Because right now if we bring in all the renewables that are signed up to want to come to our state, there will be a significant depression of pricing during the day. By having Bitcoin there to assist, to stabilize those prices throughout the day, it's going to drive more renewables into our system. And that's good for Texas.”&nbsp;</p><p>–<a href="https://twitter.com/DocumentingBTC/status/1614634614504493056">Brad Jones</a>, former Interim CEO of ERCOT</p></blockquote><p>Moreover, research suggests that demand-response programs are competitors to traditional, flexible-generation plants and, by proxy, the natural gas companies that provide fuel to those plants.</p><blockquote><p>“Widespread adoption of demand response may not be viewed favourably by all participants in the power market. In particular, if the capacity value, or the availability in times of need, of demand response is significant, owners of peaking plants will likely see their capacity factors decrease as demand response takes over some or all of the responsibility for regulation, load following and ramping… This will have a significant impact on the potential for generator owners to recover their investment, possibly leading to the decommissioning of otherwise operational plants. Such a scenario would clearly be greatly opposed by operators of flexible generators, even though it may present an efficient solution for the system as a whole."&nbsp;</p><p>–“<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2014.07.098">Benefits And Challenges Of Electrical Demand Response: A Critical Review</a>”</p></blockquote><p>If flexible demand response can lead to the decommissioning of flexible generation, there would obviously be fewer potential buyers of natural gas during periods of peak demand. As variable renewables continue to increase market share within ERCOT, Carso Energy and Energy Transfer would have <a href="https://hashrateindex.com/blog/sb1751-would-hurt-bitcoin-miners-but-who-does-it-benefit/">good reason to view demand-response programs that Bitcoin mining operations participate in as competitors to peaker plants</a> that reliably buy and consume natural gas.</p><p>Of course, natural gas peaker plants are necessary when solar and wind aren’t available, enabling miners to continue mining during those hours. On the surface, this would appear to make Bitcoin miners and natural gas companies close allies. However, if oil and gas executives concur with Jones and the research above, there would be <a href="https://hashrateindex.com/blog/sb1751-would-hurt-bitcoin-miners-but-who-does-it-benefit/">a motive</a> for oil and gas companies to negatively color the public’s perception of Bitcoin’s participation in ERCOT demand-response programs. Natural gas may be maintaining its market share within ERCOT as renewables grow, but the industry would rather increase its market share and eliminate competition to secure its long-term future.</p><figure>

For example, <a href="https://archive.is/pk9qx">Energy Transfer raked in $2.4 billion during the February 2021 blackout of Winter Storm Uri</a>, by using natural gas as a peaking asset — storing it when the price is low, and selling when demand skyrocketed. </p><p>Exporting natural gas to Mexico during a severe weather event in Texas can be even more profitable for the Wahalajara pipeline operators, since the Mexican price might be even higher — especially If ERCOT were more reliant on natural gas peakers. During the 2021 Texas winter blackouts, the price of natural gas in Mexico <a href="https://mexicobusiness.news/energy/news/cfe-embroiled-us400-million-legal-dispute-goldman-sachs">skyrocketed to 100 times normal prices</a>. Natural gas peaker plants struggled during Uri, as natural gas was <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nagham-Sami/publication/279188724/figure/fig3/AS:614193791266818@1523446619432/Hydrate-formation-in-natural-gas-transmission-pipeline-2.png?ref=hashrateindex.com">freezing in pipes</a>.</p><p>After an influx of mining rigs from China relocated to Texas <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-58414555">in late 2021</a>, many became sanctioned as <a href="https://www.ercot.com/files/docs/2022/11/29/SARA_Winter2022-23.pdf">large flexible loads (LFLs) within ERCOT</a>. Today, LFLs are providing and profiting from ancillary services that natural gas peaker plants would have previously dominated. And they are doing so at a lower price point that peaker plants struggle to compete with — saving Texans money on their electric bills by getting more for less. In fact, LFLs <a href="https://finbold.com/texas-bitcoin-miners-resume-operations-after-shutting-down-due-to-high-power-demand/">helped balance the grid and avoid blackouts during the summer heat wave of 2022</a> and <a href="https://finbold.com/bitcoin-miners-returned-enough-power-to-heat-1-5-million-homes-during-texas-blizzard/">during Winter Storm Elliot</a>, over Christmas of 2022 — freeing up over 3,000 megawatts of spare capacity on the grid. This success was forecasted by ERCOT a few weeks prior to Winter Storm Elliot, in a report that heralded Bitcoin miners <a href="https://www.ercot.com/files/docs/2022/11/29/SARA_Winter2022-23.pdf">as beneficial to balancing the grid during extreme weather events</a>.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>The Gray Lady Attacks Bitcoin</h2><p>In November 2022, five months before his anti-Bitcoin mining article was published, Gabriel Dance — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/gabriel-dance">deputy investigations editor at The New York Times</a> — attended the Texas Blockchain Summit, in Austin, as part of his investigative research. A few weeks later, he began emailing participants from the conference, promising to include their nuanced perspectives in his upcoming article.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Dance ultimately proved this was all a ruse. When his article was finally published, it became evident that he chose to omit all of the pro-Bitcoin mining arguments and only included unbecoming quotes from its proponents.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1645426405793038337"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>The substance of Dance’s article deserves harsh criticism. It was filled with disinformation and fallacious reporting about the role of demand response that has since been <a href="https://www.btcpolicy.org/articles/the-absurdity-of-the-nyts-latest-bitcoin-hit-piece">thoroughly debunked by the Bitcoin Policy Institute</a>. Dance’s reporting contradicted the <a href="https://www.energy.gov/oe/demand-response">U.S. Department of Energy, which views demand response favorably</a>. It also conflicted with <a href="https://twitter.com/level39/status/1645550345265852418">earlier endorsements of demand response from The New York Times</a>, going back at least to 2007. </p><p>Here is a selection of previous endorsements from the Times:</p><blockquote><p>“Across the United States, several thousand businesses and residential customers are ceding control of their electrical systems during moments of unusually high demand. And they are getting paid to do it. The system, based on a concept called ‘demand response,’ is one of the latest ways that Internet technology is being applied to manage over-stretched U.S. power supplies better.”</p><p>–“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/technology/04iht-rbogcut.1.8184549.html">Demand Response Technology Shaves Peak Energy Consumption By Remote Control</a>,” The New York Times, November 7, 2007</p></blockquote><p>In 2009, The New York Times <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/green.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/17/dimming-the-lights-to-meet-demand/?searchResultPosition=1">reported that demand response had been endorsed</a> by the Obama administration’s Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman, Jon Wellinghoff.</p><blockquote><p>“The Obama administration, Congress and the new Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman, Jon Wellinghoff, have all focused on reducing peak demand. Mr. Wellinghoff has called demand response the ‘killer application’ of the smart grid.”</p><p>–“<a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/green.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/17/dimming-the-lights-to-meet-demand/?searchResultPosition=1">Dimming The Lights To Meet Demand</a>,” The New York Times, April 17, 2009</p></blockquote><p>In 2010, in its “Energy And Environment” section of the paper, the Times continued to extol the benefits of demand response to its readers.</p><blockquote><p>“This concept, called demand response, has gained traction in utility circles. In essence, it involves paying users to make small sacrifices when there is an urgent need for extra power (the ‘peak’). The utility can then rely on cutting some demand on its system at crucial times and, in theory, avoid the cost of building a new plant just to meet those peak needs… For farmers, however, this process isn't easy. Workers must be dispatched to turn the pumps on and off, and there is a risk of crop damage.”</p><p>–“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/24/business/energy-environment/24idaho.html">Why Is A Utility Paying Customers?</a>,” The New York Times, January 23, 2010</p></blockquote><p>Again, later in 2010, the Times reiterated the Obama administration’s positive view of demand response.</p><blockquote><p>“…[Wellinghoff] sees consumers as active parts of the grid … stabilizing the grid by adjusting demand through intelligent appliances or behavior modification, known as demand response; and storing energy for various grid tasks. He thinks consumers should get paid to provide these services.”&nbsp;</p><p>–“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/29/business/energy-environment/29iht-rbogferc.html">Making The Consumer An Active Participant In The Grid</a>,” The New York Times, November 29, 2010</p></blockquote><p>The newspaper even quoted environmentalists who wanted Texas to adopt more demand response.</p><blockquote><p>“Environmentalists argue that the strains on the grid should spur Texas to work on energy-saving strategies. In particular, they are pushing a program called demand response, in which businesses and consumers are paid to reduce power at times of high demand, like late summer afternoons. Colin Meehan, a clean energy analyst with the Environmental Defense Fund in Texas, said in an e-mail that Texas had ‘so far only taken very small steps’ on demand response.”&nbsp;</p><p>–“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/23/business/energy-environment/electric-grid-in-texas-faces-multiple-challenges.html">Electric Grid In Texas Faces Multiple Challenges</a>,” The New York Times, December 22, 2011</p></blockquote><p>The Times continued to praise demand response throughout the Obama administration, almost as if it was doing the administration’s job to promote the technology.</p><blockquote><p>“But balancing the grid involves more than just increasing capacity. Perhaps the state’s most promising conservation tool is ‘demand response,’ … The programs, which are voluntary in Texas, can take many forms… Demand response ‘probably deserves more focus and attention,’ said Doyle Beneby, the president of C.P.S. Energy, a municipally owned utility that has not taken a position in the capacity market debate. ‘In Texas, it could be a big part of the solution.’”&nbsp;</p><p>–“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/24/us/with-strain-on-electric-grid-a-push-to-prioritize-conservation.html?searchResultPosition=1">With Strain On Electric Grid, A Push To Prioritize Conservation</a>,” The New York Times, January 23, 2014</p></blockquote><p>And yet, Dance’s hit piece against Bitcoin mining single-handedly reversed the Times' position on demand response. Dance wrote the following passage, which makes demand response sound like an evil scheme for flexible customers to defraud retail customers:</p><blockquote><p>“Their massive energy consumption combined with their ability to shut off almost instantly allows some companies to save money and make money by deftly pulling the levers of U.S. power markets. They can avoid fees charged during peak demand, resell their electricity at a premium when prices spike and even be paid for offering to turn off. Other major energy users, like factories and hospitals, cannot reduce their power use as routinely or dramatically without severe consequences.”&nbsp;</p><p>–“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/09/business/bitcoin-mining-electricity-pollution.html">The Real-World Costs Of The Digital Race For Bitcoin</a>,” The New York Times, April 9, 2023</p></blockquote><p>It all begs a long list of questions: Why did The New York Times spend months researching an article that distracts readers from serious environmental issues, only to focus on a technology that is only responsible for an infinitesimal <a href="https://ccaf.io/cbeci/ghg/comparisons">0.14% of global emissions</a>? Why did it ignore a December 2022 ERCOT study that showed <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/applied-direct-response-ercot-study-shows-bitcoin-mining-is-beneficial-to-the-texas-grid/">large flexible loads, such as Bitcoin mining operations, were beneficial</a> to the Texas grid? Why did The New York Times ignore the fact that <a href="https://finbold.com/bitcoin-miners-returned-enough-power-to-heat-1-5-million-homes-during-texas-blizzard/">Bitcoin mining played a significant role in avoiding blackouts during Winter Storm Elliot, over Christmas</a> and during the <a href="https://finbold.com/texas-bitcoin-miners-resume-operations-after-shutting-down-due-to-high-power-demand/">2022 summer heat wave</a>? Why did it ignore that Bitcoin mining reliably <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/intermittent-bitcoin-mining-fixes-energy">provides a price floor</a> for overbuilding renewable generation on the ERCOT grid? Why single out a sanctioned demand-response customer that was, <a href="https://youtu.be/gKnRfDeFgr0">according to ERCOT’s former interim CEO</a>, largely responsible for bringing in large-scale, variable renewable projects into Texas? Why did The New York Times <a href="https://twitter.com/level39/status/1645550330162102272">reverse more than a decade of support</a> for pro-renewable demand response programs that were <a href="https://www.energy.gov/oe/demand-response">championed by the U.S. Department of Energy</a> and <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/green.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/17/dimming-the-lights-to-meet-demand/?searchResultPosition=1">Obama’s Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman</a>? Why, after months of research, did The New York Times publish its anti-Bitcoin mining story precisely when the Texas legislature <a href="https://hashrateindex.com/blog/sb1751-would-hurt-bitcoin-miners-but-who-does-it-benefit/">was voting on bills that attack Bitcoin mining demand-response programs and replace them with natural gas peaker plants</a>? Why did the Times’ editors use <a href="https://twitter.com/level39/status/1646204715833737216">allegedly-manipulated footage that made it appear as if there was smog in Rockdale, Texas</a>?</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Very little about the hit piece makes any sense. Is it a coincidence that <em>The New York Times </em>attacked Texas Bitcoin mining at just the right time that it could benefit one of its largest shareholders?</p><blockquote><p>“The point is, Slim doesn’t have to interfere at all. I know from experience that publishers do intervene in the editorial process, as is their prerogative. And I can assure you that Slim’s investment will be a factor, even if unspoken, in editorial decision-making henceforth at the Times. Perhaps Mexico’s crony capitalism will remain a mostly neglected topic — but now conspiracies will be read into the neglect.”&nbsp;</p><p>–<a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2009/01/will-carlos-slim-use-the-new-york-times-to-bolster-his-reputation.html">Andreas Martinez</a>, former columnist for The New York Times</p></blockquote><p>We may never know if Slim influenced the editorial process in the newspaper’s latest hit piece attacking Bitcoin mining. However, it would fit an ongoing pattern of The New York Times <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/20/el-chapo-or-carlos-slim-who-is-more-dangerous">protecting Slim’s business interests</a> in addition to patterns of alleged, <a href="https://www.thegrayladywinked.com">calculated, systemic bias and distortions</a>. Whether these are all coincidences, or something more, may be up for debate. However, editors of the Times seem more than willing to sacrifice the newspaper’s remaining shreds of journalistic integrity for whatever motivates them to run such hit pieces. </p><p>More and more readers, on the other hand, are beginning to distrust mainstream media and it doesn’t help when the largest shareholders of media companies are positioned to reap profits from the reporting. There is little recourse in such matters, however, bringing attention to potential conflicts of interest may at least provide some context to otherwise inexplicable editorial decisions.</p><p><em>Thanks to Justin Orkney for assistance with this article.</em></p><p><em>This is a guest post by Level39.

Trader and art dealer Steven Hay has even suggested that <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/el-salvador-bitcoin-ordinal-collection">the government of El Salvador release an official Ordinal art collection</a> to potentially raise money to fund its proposed Bitcoin City or otherwise accelerate Bitcoin adoption.</p><p>Unfortunately, this suggestion seems to lack an on-the-ground Salvadoran perspective and, in my view, is a blatant attack on El Salvador’s Bitcoin objectives.</p><p>El Salvador turned to Bitcoin <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/print/stop-drinking-the-elites-kool-aid">because of the qualities that make it sovereign money</a>, one that is not beholden to foreign powers or organizations. While a couple of the leading value propositions for using Bitcoin in El Salvador are to attract private, foreign investment and to spur tourism, the promise of hard money that is unconfiscatable, uncensorable and resistant to manipulation is why El Salvador made bitcoin legal tender. </p><p>However, Ordinals do not provide any of the hard money benefits of Bitcoin.</p><h2>NFTs On Bitcoin Are As Bad As NFTs Elsewhere</h2><p>The Bitcoin community has seen recent, vivid examples demonstrating that NFTs are bad investments. </p><p>For example, a Malaysian investor who bought <a href="https://v.cent.co/tweet/20">Jack Dorsey’s first tweet NFT</a> for $2.5 million <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/bought-29-mln-nft-jack-dorsey-tweet-finds-few-takers-2022-04-14/">struggled to find bids when he later tried to sell it</a>. Even El Salvador President Nayib Bukele<a href="https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1452160674856116229?lang=en"> appeared to recognize the lack of real value in NFTs</a> as he auctioned <a href="https://v.cent.co/tweet/1402507224916836352?s=u_a">his tweet announcing the country’s Bitcoin Law approval in its legislative assembly</a> — the NFT was never sold and Bukele did not pursue the endeavor any further.</p><p>Numerous <a href="https://twitter.com/nvk/status/1619667314944925697?s=20">maximalists</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/arekkusudes/status/1650600273365336064?s=20">Salvadorans</a> have been discouraging Bitcoin NFTs because they believe that folks who get rug-pulled could suffer significant financial harm. For many of these critics, defending Bitcoin’s social layer and calling out potential scams is essential to keeping the Bitcoin network secure. </p><p>There are several key elements that critics consistently bring up, which could demonstrate that Bitcoin NFTs on the Ordinal protocol are grifts and no different than NFTs on other protocols. These are as follow:</p><ol><li>The hype around NFTs is arbitrarily assigning exaggerated values to things that are not inherently scarce.</li><li>The <a href="https://twitter.com/402PaymentReq/status/1621845134496210944?s=20">Ordinal protocol cannot actually track individual satoshis</a> as <a href="https://docs.ordinals.com/overview.html#:~:text=Ordinals%20are%20a%20numbering%20scheme,tracking%20and%20transferring%20individual%20sats.">claimed by the creators and promoters of the protocol</a>.</li><li>The Bitcoin protocol is unaware of the inscriptions or Ordinals, so none of it is verifiable by the network.</li><li>There are debatable concerns on the impact of inscription activity on storage resources of node runners. </li><li>The NFTs scams are a significant distraction from the integrity of Bitcoin’s primary purpose.</li><li>Finally, the intellectual dishonesty that markets Ordinals as “art investment” that will increase in value over time.</li></ol><p>Taking the above elements into account, an El Salvador Ordinals buyer risks purchasing an expensive, low-quality, reproducible image that’s likely to decrease in value. While there is a valid argument that the marketplace will decide whether it wants such a digital product, critics point out that people should be aware of the inherent grift of the NFT space and the similarities to promotions of Ordinals.</p><p>To paraphrase the creator of <a href="https://timechaincalendar.com/en">Timechain Calendar</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Meditation_Man">TC</a>, who has spoken on this topic in several Twitter Spaces conversations that I’ve heard, “A blockchain makes a very poor database. It only works in Bitcoin because it is only verifying the truth about Bitcoin transactions.” </p><p>Another Bitcoiner, <a href="https://twitter.com/HodlMagoo">Magoo</a>, has opined in similar Twitter Spaces that adding engineering complexity to the Bitcoin timechain or any software is congruent with increasing possible attack vectors. These attack vectors can appear not only in the network itself but also in the social layer. As such, Ordinals have the potential to manifest attack vectors in each of these layers. It has encouraged people to focus their energy on an activity that Bitcoin was not designed or optimized for.</p><h2>Ordinals Contradict Proof Of Work</h2><p>While the CEO of BTC Inc (which operates Bitcoin Magazine), <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidFBailey">David Bailey</a>, has argued that <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidFBailey/status/1626523168801189896">Bitcoin NFTs on the Ordinals protocol are compatible with Nakamoto consensus</a>, they are antithetical to Bitcoin because their marketing suggests that they will increase in value, and that violates the concept of proof of work. </p><p>In the same line of thought, Hay proposed that a government Ordinal collection would be all benefit and no risk, implying that it’s easy money — but the principles behind proof of work demand that money should not be easy to generate through natural law. </p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/saifedean">Saifedean Ammous</a> wrote about this topic in several sections of his book “The Bitcoin Standard,” emphasizing that creating hard money requires an effort to provide value and benefit to the market and society. Ordinals are a high-time-preference activity based on easy money and speculation; therefore, encouraging El Salvador’s Bitcoin adoption acceleration by releasing an Ordinals collection is peak fiat mentality.</p><h2>Salvadorans Don’t Need Ordinals</h2><p>El Salvador has a rich pool of artistic talent, including musicians, actors, filmmakers, dancers, folklorists, writers, architects and visual artists. Those Bitcoiners eager to help the country with its adoption will do well to support the existing artist community by promoting them and paying for their crafts by using bitcoin. </p><p>As a starting point, Bitcoiners can go to the <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294476-d7126187-Reviews-Mercado_Nacional_de_Artesanias-San_Salvador_San_Salvador_Department.html">National Artisan Market</a>, where people can find paintings, indigo-dyed apparel, hammocks and sculptures. Bitcoiners can also provide opportunities to digital artists, such as graphic designers, through contracts for working on web projects, apps and in print, and they can support digital content creators by giving value-for-value tips for their published works.</p><p>Ultimately, Salvadorans are <a href="https://www.canal12.com.sv/noticia/principal-preocupacion-de-el-salvador-es-la-economia-segun-encuesta/">more concerned about improving their day-to-day situations</a> than collecting JPEGs on mobile phones. The everyday Salvadoran demands that their government focus on security, infrastructure, public transit, traffic, health and education. Therefore, issuing an NFT collection is far from what Salvadorans value.</p><p>Given that El Salvador has had <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/el-salvador-bitcoin-one-year-later">relatively positive success with its Bitcoin adoption</a>, it’s easy to forget that its current government had a rough start and faced much criticism with its formal Bitcoin adoption launch.</p><p>Many criticized the government’s <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/el-salvador-fixing-chivo-bitcoin-wallet">release of the Chivo wallet</a> over insufficient accompanying education and the technical challenges experienced by some users. The primary recipient for much of this negative feedback was not the government itself, but Bitcoin as a whole, thereby hindering Bitcoin adoption. </p><p>Heading into Bitcoin’s second anniversary as legal tender in El Salvador, some of the negative perceptions created around Bitcoin are finally beginning to fade. But if the government were to release a Bitcoin NFT collection, that would only rewind the progress made.</p><p>The government must not promote Ordinals or NFTs, as many perceive them as scams. El Salvador needs to generate confidence and trust, and when Ordinals, <a href="https://cryptomode.com/the-significant-decline-in-nft-marketplace-activity-shouldnt-surprise-anyone/">like NFT projects of the past</a>, inevitably crash, El Salvador cannot be associated with them. Unfortunately, any negative perception about Ordinals would lead to reputational damage for the country, which is precisely where the attacks on Bitcoin adoption continue. </p><h2>The Bitcoin Mission is Clear</h2><p>Despite being inundated with all of the Ordinal noise, it is refreshing to see folks like South Africa’s <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinEkasi">Bitcoin Ekasi</a> work toward the Bitcoin mission with absolute clarity. In a recent tweet, the Bitcoin Ekasi team said it is <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinEkasi/status/1647575965827047424?s=20">“not here to have fun” but to change the world</a>. There is a real chance of failure for groups like Bitcoin Ekasi due to these distractions from the primary mission of adopting the hardest money in the world. With that same level of clarity, El Salvador must remain undeterred from these attacks.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by </em><em>Jaime García</em><em>.

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Jonathan Buck, founder of JB &amp; GS Mining GmbH, a German bitcoin mining hosting company.</em></p><p>In April 2022, the Central African Republic (CAR) <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/the-central-african-republic-adopts-bitcoin-as-legal-tender">adopted bitcoin as legal tender</a>, becoming the second nation in history to do so. However, just a year later, <a href="https://www.centralbanking.com/central-banks/currency/digital-currencies/7956294/car-to-drop-crypto-as-legal-tender">the nation reversed its decision</a>. But what are the reasons behind <a href="https://www.jbgsmining.com/en/post/central-african-republic-drops-bitcoin-as-legal-tender">this failure in the CAR</a>?</p><h2>Challenging Economic Conditions</h2><p>The CAR, one of the poorest countries in the world, faces numerous obstacles, such as political instability, inadequate infrastructure and food shortages. </p><p><a href="https://www.wfp.org/countries/central-african-republic">In the 2018 Human Development Index, </a>the CAR ranked second to last, with around 79% of its 4.7 million residents living in poverty. More than three million people in the country <a href="https://www.concernusa.org/story/central-african-republic-crisis-explained/">are reported to require humanitarian assistance while more than 85% of the population lacks electricity</a>. </p><p>One of the significant barriers to the success of the Bitcoin project in the CAR was surely the country’s limited internet access. With only about <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IT.NET.USER.ZS?locations=CF">10% percent of the population having access to the internet</a>, widespread adoption of digital currencies was highly unlikely.</p><p>While Bitcoin has been helping to bank the unbanked globally, the digital currency alone cannot solve all of a country's underlying infrastructure problems. And while Bitcoin can be resilient off the grid, the lack of basic amenities such as electricity and internet in CAR likely hindered the spread and usability of Bitcoin there.</p><h2>Skepticism And International Concern</h2><p>The introduction of bitcoin as legal tender in CAR was met with skepticism, partly due to the country’s close ties with Russia, raising suspicions about its potential plans to <a href="https://african.business/2022/10/technology-information/is-central-african-republics-crypto-push-linked-to-russia">use cryptocurrencies to bypass sanctions</a>. </p><p>The United Nations also warned that developing countries like the CAR could <a href="https://www.globalgovernmentfintech.com/un-agency-warns-on-crypto-in-developing-nations/">face high risks and costs associated with cryptocurrencies</a>.</p><p>And, ultimately, the economic benefits promised by the proponents of Bitcoin in the CAR never materialized. Ambitious projects, such as building a “<a href="https://sango.org/#cryptoCitySection">Bitcoin city</a>,” failed or never began, further dampening enthusiasm for the digital currency experiment.</p><h2>A Larger Trend?</h2><p><br>Despite the disappointment in the CAR, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been gaining traction in other African countries. For example, countries such as Nigeria and South Africa have seen a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abubakarnurkhalil/2023/03/01/nigerian-election-and-naira-crisis-is-fueling-bitcoin-adoption/">significant increases in bitcoin adoption</a>, with millions of users now buying, selling and trading digital assets. In these countries, the growth of the cryptocurrency industry has been driven by factors such as the high inflation rate of local fiat currencies; an increasing number of young, tech-savvy individuals; and a growing number of businesses accepting bitcoin as a payment method.</p><p>In the end, the failure of bitcoin as legal tender in the CAR can be attributed to the nation's challenging economic conditions, skepticism surrounding its motives, limited access to technology and unfulfilled peripheral promises. </p><p>But despite this failure, other African countries represent some of the world’s most promising, growing epicenters of Bitcoin adoption. If anything, this failure in the CAR highlights the importance of developed environments and good-faith intentions for the successful adoption of Bitcoin, at least for the first handful of countries that hope to be successful.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Jonathan Buck.

    </figure><p>Oftentimes, when you hear about the “American dream,” you think of a heart-warming success story. The entrepreneur who made millions. Or the immigrant family that changed the trajectory for their children. And while these inspiring stories do exist, there are many others who came to America hoping for a better life only to be met with countless obstacles that hindered them from achieving their American dreams.</p><p>Modern-day monetary policy runs on fluctuating interest rates and inflation. Many people are not aware that the U.S. dollar, which was founded on a gold-reserve system, has not only been off of the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2021/01/25/the-gold-standard-ended-50-years-ago-federal-debt-has-only-exploded-since/?sh=7286f7301e17">gold standard</a> for over 50 years, but is now “backed” by the United States military and <a href="https://faculty.georgetown.edu/imo3/petrod/define.htm">petrodollar</a>. The amount of control that the United States government has on those living in poverty is astronomical. Because of these limiting restrictions, among other factors, the American dream has become much harder to achieve. </p><p>However, Bitcoin can help change this negative cycle.</p><p>Natalie Brunell burst onto the Bitcoin scene in 2021. She was born in Poland and immigrated with her parents to America as a young child. Growing up with a family that was determined to build a new life in America, the value of hard work and a healthy amount of skepticism was ingrained into Brunell for as long as she can remember. </p><p>With over ten years of experience in the media sector, she took a risk and started her own <a href="https://talkingbitcoin.com/podcast">Bitcoin podcast</a>. Since then, <em>Coin Stories</em> has been wildly successful and influential in highlighting power players in the Bitcoin space. </p><p>Her story is inspiring and welcoming to anyone interested in getting started on their Bitcoin journeys. </p><p><strong>How did you first learn about Bitcoin and what specifically drew you to it?</strong></p><p>I first learned about Bitcoin in 2016 from a group of friends while working as a local news reporter covering breaking and investigative stories in Sacramento, California. I didn’t understand Bitcoin’s technological innovation or the mission of Bitcoin’s proponents to address systemic issues in our financial system. In fact, I equated it back then to investing in stocks.</p><p>Luckily, I bought a little bit and held through my first bear market. I also pitched a story about Bitcoin to my news outlet and ended up reporting on a local Bitcoin ATM. I was fascinated by this emerging technology, but my station was not keen on covering more stories on it, so I let it go as a reporting assignment.</p><p>It wasn’t until a few years later when my mentor told me to read <a href="https://saifedean.com/tbs"><em>The Bitcoin Standard</em></a>&nbsp;that I began my journey down the Bitcoin rabbit hole. Saifedean Ammous’s book changed my perspective on money and sparked my idea for the <em>Coin Stories</em> podcast, which ultimately changed my career and my life. </p><p>What drew me to Bitcoin was the idea of removing the state’s monopoly on money and creating an opportunity for our economy to be rebuilt on a sound monetary unit that is immune to manipulation. I envision a world where money is based on value rather than proximity to politics and power.</p><p><strong>What made you leave your traditional media job to pursue Bitcoin?</strong></p><p>Ever since I was a young girl, I aspired to become a broadcast journalist. My family immigrated from Poland to Chicago when I was five years old. My family always had the news on at home because the programming helped my parents learn to speak English and kept us informed about current events both overseas and in our new home country. My idol growing up was Barbara Walters.</p><p>I always believed in journalists as watchdogs, not government lap dogs. My parents grew up under a communist regime and were always skeptical of both central authority and media propaganda. I’m grateful for that upbringing because it caused me to question everything around me and made me a more determined reporter.</p><p>I spent more than ten years working in mainstream news media and became disillusioned by the increasing bias I saw on various networks. I was fortunate to be able to cover in-depth investigative pieces in my last TV correspondent position that were not politicized, but the industry around me was moving in the direction of partisanship, censorship of alternative views and prioritization of access to politicians rather than pursuing and demanding accountability.</p><p>When preparation meets opportunity, that’s “luck.” I had the communication skills and media training (preparation) and the market had a growing demand for knowledge (opportunity). Bitcoin offered me an opportunity to leave mainstream media in October 2021 to develop my podcast and promote Bitcoin education. I decided to bet on myself and see if I could build a business doing something I believed would ultimately impact the world more than my news reporting. I have never felt more fulfilled by what I do and I am propelled by a sense of duty to help people understand our financial system and the benefits of Bitcoin, a revolutionary fix for our money.</p><p><strong>How do you typically respond to those who are dismissive of Bitcoin, especially those close to you (such as your close friends, etc.)?</strong></p><p>I respond with, “I know; I was there once, too.” Being skeptical and critical is a good thing, it means you’re not easily persuaded or sold on the latest fad. It means you think for yourself. That’s already a win. I try to meet the person where they are. One of my mentors, Jeff Booth, has an excellent question to pose to skeptics and newcomers to Bitcoin. That question is: “If technology is supposed to make things cheaper and easier to produce, why is the cost of living around us continually going up?”</p><p>It’s a simple but powerful question that drives at the heart of the problem in our monetary system: inflation.</p><p>Every year, it gets more and more difficult to afford a home, a college education and retirement. The rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and we’re all working harder for currencies that are worth less and less. This isn’t a natural phenomenon of our existence. It is the synthetic outcome of the state monopoly on money, and it impacts every aspect of our lives.</p><p>When I do engage with friends on the topic of Bitcoin, I encourage them to note the various crises they're hearing and reading about, or perhaps even experiencing directly. Most people have a sense that things are really challenging at the moment, that we seem to be moving in the wrong direction. Once that groundwork is laid, I can spark their curiosity about why Bitcoin offers such a powerful alternative.</p><p><strong>In your opinion, why is it important to close the gender gap in Bitcoin interest and adoption?</strong></p><p>I released the first episodes of my podcast at the Bitcoin 2021 conference. I attended the event on a media pass and brought my best friend, Paula, along for company because I didn’t know anyone personally in Bitcoin. My intention was to meet fellow Bitcoiners and try to ask individuals I admired to appear on the show, with no intention of building a career in the space.</p><p>I had never attended industry conferences and was taken aback by the size and number of attendees. But it was hard not to notice a massive gender gap in that audience. In fact, nowhere was it more apparent than when you looked at any conference restroom area: there would be a queue of men stretching around a corner on one side, and a vast, empty expanse on the women’s side. </p><p>I began to think more deeply about why women were so underrepresented in this industry. As we know, finance, engineering and computer science are all male-dominated fields that organically intersect with Bitcoin, so it makes sense that a male audience would discover this amazing technology before a female audience. Social media also tends to perpetuate a "crypto bro culture" that obscures the global community of Bitcoin pioneers doing brilliant, wholehearted work. Bitcoin is an inherently multifaceted technology that takes time and effort to understand, and even requires some reeducation around money in general. I believe that all newcomers to Bitcoin, and women in particular, including my closest friends, who are already busy industry leaders and smart investors, need trusted and approachable guides to help navigate around these barriers.</p><p>I saw this imbalance as an opportunity to grow the space and connect with these newcomers. Ever since that first conference, I have been determined to become a resource for ordinary working people, and especially women, to learn more about Bitcoin and how our global economy works. </p><p>Bitcoin is for everyone. Bitcoin is a tool of freedom and prosperity for every gender, age, race, language, cultural background, and political affiliation. Bitcoin levels the playing field and can bring us all together in cooperation. I am passionate about educating other women about Bitcoin because I want them to have a seat at the table of this financial revolution and empower themselves and their families for the long run. We often feel the most comfortable learning from and engaging with people who look and sound like us. If I can serve as a welcoming voice for new women in the Bitcoin space, I see it as an honor. I love being a woman, I love learning from and connecting with other women, and I am so proud to be a woman in Bitcoin. Discovering Bitcoin is incredibly empowering, and we need to continue building a supportive, inquisitive community for that journey.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Becca Bratcher.

According to <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2023-04-28-Introducing-Crypto-Transfers-for-Venmo-Customers">the announcement</a>, more than 50% of its cryptocurrency-using customers chose Venmo due to its safety, security and ease of use, while more than 74% of customers have continued to hold their cryptocurrency in their Venmo account over the past year.</p><p>The transfer process is designed to be simple and can be done in a few steps via the Venmo app. Customers can navigate to the Crypto tab, view their assets, tap the Transfer arrows and choose to send bitcoin to a Venmo account, or by entering a recipient’s wallet address to send to PayPal or another external wallet. Customers can also tap Receive to display their unique bitcoin address QR code, which can be shared with other people.</p><p>Venmo is quick to note that cryptocurrency transfers cannot be canceled or reversed, which is something that can be difficult for new Bitcoin users to get used to, but eliminates chargebacks and other complications presented by fiat rails. </p><p>“Crypto transfers will be rolling out to Venmo customers over the coming weeks starting in May 2023,” Venmo said in a press release. “We’re excited to connect Venmo’s customers to the community, other wallets and exchanges, and we intend to continue to roll out additional crypto products and services in the year ahead.”</p><p>Being one of the largest mobile finance applications in the United States and a first step into bitcoin for many, this update now introduces users to the ability to take self-custody of their bitcoin, an <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-self-custody-and-financial-sovereignty">essential step in realizing the full properties bitcoin</a> entails.

Some were excited by this new experimentation, which <a href="https://covers.bitcoinmagazine.com/#FAQ">sought to provide buyers with a trust-minimizing experience</a>, while others were not so happy.</p><p>David Bailey, the CEO of BTC Inc, the parent company of Bitcoin Magazine, tweeted that the world’s first Bitcoin-only magazine <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidFBailey/status/1647430173661224961">received</a> harsh reaction from the Bitcoin community.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/DavidFBailey/status/1647603125652533250"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>Francis Pouliot, the founder of non-custodial, bitcoin-only exchange and payments service Bull Bitcoin, underscored the criticisms in a reply to that tweet:</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/francispouliot_/status/1647607570377392128"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><h2>The Ordinal Controversy</h2><p>Ordinals <a href="https://github.com/casey/ord/blob/master/bip.mediawiki">were proposed</a> in 2022 by developer Casey Rodarmor. Launched on Bitcoin’s mainnet on January 21, 2023, it is a <a href="https://docs.ordinals.com/introduction.html">protocol</a> that creates an inscription whereby “sats” (short for “satoshis,” the lowest denomination of a bitcoin) can be inscribed with arbitrary data. This can include JPEG files, clips and even video games.</p><p>But the introduction of the Ordinal protocol has stirred up a controversy which has divided the Bitcoin community. While some have shown favor for the prospect of inscribing collectibles on the chain permanently — assisting the flourishing of the arts in the Bitcoin space, creating monetary demand for Bitcoin blockspace, incentivizing miners and more — others have expressed concerns about storing that data directly on Bitcoin. </p><p>Significant push back has <a href="https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/1619824591580598272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1619824591580598272%7Ctwgr%5E49456bfba5687743e46fb9c1784466db09cf286f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdecrypt.co%2F120250%2Fordinals-launches-nfts-on-bitcoin-triggers-controversy">come from</a> influential Bitcoin Maximalists, with some <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/luke-dashjr-doesnt-want-his-name-on-bitcoin-nfts">condemning</a> the project as a direct attack on Bitcoin.</p><h2>What Is Bitcoin ‘For’?</h2><p><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-magazine-announces-historic-nft-auction">Bitcoin Magazine’s</a> first public steps on its journey in the world of Ordinals, marked by this first auction, were met with disdain. Some perceived the move as a mere extension of the NFT culture, which incentivizes making quick money on pump-and-dump schemes.</p><p>But this controversy has now sparked new debates. Regardless of our differences of opinion on “NFTs on Bitcoin,” the implementation of Ordinals is providing us with an opportunity for education. It helps us deeply examine Bitcoin's core values and our roles in the network.</p><p>What is Bitcoin? What is it meant for? Bitcoin was invented as peer-to-peer digital cash. In its white paper, its pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">described</a> Bitcoin as “an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.”</p><p>Bitcoin’s trust-minimized transactions enable censorship resistance. Many of those who criticize Ordinals are Bitcoin loyalists. They see Bitcoin’s base layer as something to be used strictly to settle monetary transactions and they oppose any move to extend beyond this original use case.</p><p>Also, concerns have been raised by Ordinal critics regarding these non-monetary transactions taking up Bitcoin’s limited block space, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-records-largest-mined-block-to-date-4-mb-block-containing-nft-causes-unease-among-small-block-supporters/">as inscriptions can be large files</a>. Some are worried that an increased cost of running a full node could reduce the ability for users to participate in this network and maintain Bitcoin's decentralization.</p><p>(Additional possible implications and concerns around inscriptions are detailed <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-implications-of-bitcoin-inscriptions">here</a> and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/ordinal-concerns-bitcoin-decentralization-and-block-space?utm_source=Bitcoin+Magazine&amp;utm_campaign=c63022d3c9-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2023_02_27_07_32&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f7d45fbb67-c63022d3c9-43389605&amp;mc_cid=c63022d3c9&amp;mc_eid=20005d9db2">here</a>.) </p><p>So, is using Bitcoin’s foundation outside of monetary transactions bad or harmful for Bitcoin?</p><p>There is <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/concerning-ordinals">nothing within the Ordinal protocol that violates Bitcoin’s specified consensus</a>. Also, there are no rules that restrict users to monetary transactions. Bitcoin is permissionless in that everyone is allowed to use it in a way that they wish to use it. This includes adding data to transactions and using them as a database for JPEGs. As some have pointed out, this isn’t at all that new:</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/1619692068519149568"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>But just because we can do it, should we do it or encourage others to do it? </p><p>Now, this question takes us into a moral dimension. And exploring it might help us understand Bitcoin’s fundamentals.</p><h2>Impulse For Creation </h2><p>Technically, Ordinals are built on Bitcoin, working within its consensus rules. So, they can be seen as a part of the Bitcoin project. But is this true? Let’s examine. </p><p>All technologies are created by human beings, with a vision and philosophy behind them. The question we should ask is whether the impulse that led to the creation of Ordinals aligns with Bitcoin philosophy, or diverges from it. </p><p>In an interview with CoinDesk, Rodarmor <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/01/31/bitcoin-community-erupts-in-existential-debate-over-nft-project-ordinals/">spoke about</a> the vision behind Ordinals. He said that he wished it to be a fun art project and also something that can encourage people to learn more about Bitcoin. For instance, he made the point that, in order to use Ordinals, users are required to run their own full nodes and suggested that this would help people get interested in doing so, which would be good for Bitcoin.</p><p>Rodarmor also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/16/ordinals-creator-views-his-bitcoin-centric-creation-as-digital-artifacts-not-just-nfts/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKPFWLeMiAfRdYa7lSKXnsMABHcmKnbZXRv_jvdSxtToI61pPpBLF80USOl1yzLJltWsncHNZAwZdPr3fXB1Qg7Hv8k9ICJT83XXhW7l5mEzDrhwU_A9VLIGQwaOva90sh8bmJay8TG8yUj4a4-tePySR4Es50-GWmqfJORkw6vZ#:~:text=Ordinals%2C%20a%20Bitcoin%2Dbased%20NFT,no%20idea%20it%20would%20explode.">noted</a> that, with the creation of Ordinals, he tried to fulfill an unmet market demand from NFT collectors, and it seems that this playful way of experimenting on Bitcoin did respond to those desires. The project has attracted many users, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ordinal-inscriptions-surpass-1-million-mark-miners-collect-4-7m-in-fees-as-bitcoin-nft-trend-continues/">producing</a> over one million inscriptions incorporated into transactions less than three months after its debut.</p><p>Certainly, market demands drive the development of technology. Many protocols and apps were created to please and satisfy the desires of consumers. Yet, there was something other than simple commercial interests at work behind the invention of Bitcoin.</p><p>The impulse for Bitcoin didn’t come from market demand. It arose somewhere else, outside of business and profit motives. Bitcoin is the holy grail of cypherpunks, a community of activists connected by ​​an<a href="https://lists.cpunks.org/pipermail/cypherpunks/"> electronic mailing list</a> who had long advocated for free speech and privacy protected by the use of strong cryptography. </p><h2>The Vision Of The Cypherpunks</h2><p>Who are the cypherpunks? In his 2015 essay, titled “The Moral Character Of Cryptographic Work,” Phillip Rogaway, a professor of computer science, <a href="https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/papers/moral-fn.pdf">described</a> them as “cryptographers with ethics,” noting that they brought major shifts in the approach to scientific work that had previously been detached politically and divorced from the moral dimension.</p><p>Cypherpunks aim to actively develop technology in a way that is aligned with human values and priorities. For instance, Rogaway regarded Julian Assange as a representative of the value of cypherpunks and listed WikiLeaks as an example of the projects that revitalized the moral impulse in cryptographic work.</p><p>Rogaway <a href="https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/papers/moral-fn.pdf">articulated</a> the philosophy that informs their work:</p><blockquote><p>“Cypherpunk cryptography has been described as <em>crypto with an attitude</em>. But it is much more than that, for, more than anything else, what the cypherpunks wanted was crypto with <em>values</em>. And values, deeply felt and deeply embedded into our work, is what the cryptographic community needs most. And perhaps a dose of that cypherpunk verve.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Bitcoin is a part of the free software movement. It is guided by a vision of technology which can empower individuals and change the world. Richard Stallman, the godfather of the GNU/Linux operating system, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ag1AKIl_2GM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m37s">defined</a> free software as “free” in the sense of freedom, “libre” in French, and not in terms of price; software that respects users’ freedom.</p><p>At the core of Bitcoin is this value of individual freedom. It is this value that one cannot put a price tag on, that has been repeatedly threatened. </p><p>We have seen that during <a href="https://www.bitrawr.com/bitcoin-block-size-debate-explained">the block size debate</a> (centered on disagreements around the best methods of scaling for Bitcoin) that took place between 2015 and 2017. The proponents for a larger block size argued that they wanted Bitcoin to become a payments network. They wanted it to become faster, with large transaction volumes that could compete with the likes of Visa and Mastercard. As a series of proposals to change Bitcoin’s consensus emerged over time, the conflict <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/the-first-major-bitcoin-civil-war">quickly escalated into a civil war</a>.</p><p>During the heat of this scaling dispute, Amir Taaki, who was one of the first developers to work on Bitcoin, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7rXKS_SiVE&amp;t=3785s">recognized</a> that this divide was really based on a difference in values. He pointed out that the efforts to push large block sizes were a hijacking of Bitcoin's original vision, rooted in ethics. </p><h2>Bringing Love Into Computing</h2><p>Bitcoin was created by the commitment of cypherpunks to their fellow human beings — what they saw as their moral obligation to secure the right of liberty for all. With the birth of Bitcoin, love was brought into computing. This love as a moral force began to revitalize the market, moving capital dynamically toward the emancipation of humanity.</p><p>From Cypriots to Argentinians, bitcoin <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2014/11/22/the-blockchain-and-the-rise-of-networked-trust/">has become</a> a safe haven for those whose money has been debased by rampant hyperinflation and/or bank deposit confiscation. While attacks on journalists and whistleblowers intensify in many countries, Bitcoin <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmatonis/2012/08/20/wikileaks-bypasses-financial-blockade-with-bitcoin/?sh=468e46997202">offers</a> a form of asylum for <a href="http://sputniknews.com/europe/20150323/1019901312.html">dissidents of the West</a>. </p><p>Bitcoin is freedom money. Yellow Vest protesters occupying the streets of Paris <a href="https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@cryptoewp/yellow-vests-and-buy-bitcoin">recognized</a> Bitcoin as a critical linchpin for their financial revolution. When the government became authoritarian, Bitcoin <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/how-bitcoin-fueled-canada-trucker-convoy">provided</a> a rail for the Canadian trucker “Freedom Convoy” to continue its non-violent, civil disobedience in the fight against medical mandates.</p><p>And now, a nation state has joined this currency of resistance. In September 2021, El Salvador <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/07/1034838909/bitcoin-el-salvador-legal-tender-official-currency-cryptocurrency">made bitcoin legal tender</a>. Led by President Nayib Bukele and his policy of economic liberty, a small, impoverished nation with a <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/el-salvador-population/">population of about 6.5 million</a> began to liberate itself from the dictatorship of the International Monetary Fund.</p><p>Now, a new game is on that is much more fun and grand than the one played by the new kids on the block with their pokémon cards. By challenging the banking monopoly, Bukele opened up a free market contest, in which Salvadorans can now actively engage in taking back a future that had been stolen from them. </p><p>As the economy is being regenerated, human beings come alive. Bitcoin now inspires our love for creation. With the resurgence of arts and freedom of expression, we are now seeing a new renaissance. Beauty and magnificence that are demonstrated by ordinary people now extend beyond galleries of digital art collectibles and auction rooms. This is now reviving the culture that can transform our society. </p><h2>The Value Of Freedom</h2><figure>

We can pay for the available block space and use it as storage for arbitrary files, the function that could be served by other trust-minimized systems, such as <a href="https://opentimestamps.org/">OpenTimestamps</a>. Or we can choose to hold this scarce space for monetary transactions only.</p><p>Nakamoto paid homage to the sacred heart of Bitcoin that embraces each, single person. By spending tireless hours engaging in his or her labor of love, he or she paid for the whole of humanity and reserved this precious tiny space that keeps us all free. </p><p>Inspired by this selfless act of this mysterious creator, developers joined hands to ensure everyone’s access to this sanctuary. Some then became devotees of liberty. Bitcoin Maximalists remain vigilant, ready to throw out money changers who are trying to enter this temple, from shitcoiners to random JPEG posters.</p><p>We all are given freedom as our intrinsic value when we are born. This value of freedom is priceless. It cannot be secured by economic incentives alone. It demands the conscience of each person and his or her principles to defend it.</p><p>Cypherpunks write code. Can we sovereign individuals uphold their ideal and share this gift of liberty as the unalienable right of all people? </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Nozomi Hayase.

    </figure><p><a href="https://preturnio.com/">Preturnio</a>, a full-text search engine for the Bitcoin blockchain, has been introduced, allowing users to scan for Bitcoin transactions that include readable text.</p><p>Preturnio is a platform that allows for the search of plain text within any coinbase transaction, text-based ordinal inscription or OP_RETURN script since the genesis block. All data in the Bitcoin blockchain is stored natively in hexadecimal format, and Preturnio offers search results that are converted to a readable format. OP_RETURN is a unique opcode in the Bitcoin scripting language that enables data to be embedded in a transaction output without the need to spend any bitcoin. <br><br>This was added to the Bitcoin protocol in 2014, primarily to allow for the creation of simple, low-cost and secure timestamping services. OP_RETURN has been useful in various applications, including digital signatures, notarization and proof of ownership. The recently launched <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/concerning-ordinals">Ordinals</a> project has created a significant debate on the topic of immutable data time stamped onto Bitcoin. </p><p>“Regardless of where you stand on this issue,” the <a href="https://preturnio.com/docs">docs page</a> of the website states, “the fact remains that there is a ton of plain text buried in the Bitcoin blockchain so Preturnio was created to make searching for this text easier and more enjoyable.”</p><p>Preturnio searches in three areas where plain text can be found quickly: inside a coinbase transaction, inside an OP_RETURN script, and inside a text or HTML based ordinal inscription. Preturnio searches every block mined since the genesis block to locate a match inside a transaction for the text/pattern the user is looking for. The website offers various search options, with the interface designed to be as user-friendly as possible, according to the docs page. Users simply enter the text they are looking for and click the search icon or press ENTER. They can search for a single word, a phrase or just about any set of characters.</p><p>The Preturnio docs include search examples. The platform offers different types of searches, including searching for a single word or a phrase. Preturnio will return results for any transaction that contains that phrase or part of it. To match on an exact phrase, enclose the query in double quotes (“”). The website only does a literal search when enclosed in these quotes. “This is important to remember,” the website adds. “For search phrases with more than one word, Preturnio will only return for transactions with all words in the phrase - if a transaction contains one of the phrase words but not all, it won't be included in the search results.”</p><p>Preturnio aims to offer simple and effective search features that will make finding the right information embedded into Bitcoin faster and more convenient.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkxNDAxMTQ0NTc1MDc1ODcz/border-wallets-seed-phrase-recovery-top-photo.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[With Insight Honed Since $5 BTC, Tuur Demeester Is Ready For Bitcoin 2023]]></title><description><![CDATA[Tuur Demeester, a macroeconomic analyst who has offered insight into Bitcoin since 2012, will bring his unique insight to Bitcoin 2023.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/tuur-demeester-analysis-at-bitcoin-2023</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/tuur-demeester-analysis-at-bitcoin-2023</guid><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Feature]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin 2023]]></category><category><![CDATA[Tuur Demeester]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Peter Chawaga]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 27 Apr 2023 14:23:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk3NTQ3MTU5MDIzODU0NTk4/tuur-demeester-1.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

    </figure><p>Tuur Demeester has a self-described “out of the box” approach to macroeconomic analysis, and it’s one that has made his insight into Bitcoin’s unprecedented potential sought after by institutions (in 2021, Demeester’s bitcoin alpha fund Adamant Capital was <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/blockstream-to-launch-finance-division">sold to Blockstream, where he is now an advisor</a>) as well as individuals (Demeester’s is ranked as the <a href="https://hive.one/c/bitcoin">third “best Bitcoin Twitter account to follow”</a> by social media analyst Hive.One).</p><p>Combining deep research into historical patterns, an academically-rigorous approach and a willingness to embrace new innovation, Demeester’s outlook on how Bitcoin fits into our wider world has been remarkable for its consistency and prescience for more than a decade.</p><p>He first recommended BTC as an investment to readers of his newsletter in 2012, when it was priced at $5. In 2013 (with <a href="https://www.statmuse.com/money/ask/bitcoin+price+june+2013">bitcoin priced around $100</a>), <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/interview-with-tuur-demeester-1371692092">he told Bitcoin Magazine</a>:</p><p>“I think bitcoin and the cryptocurrencies are the greatest investment opportunity of our day and age. First of all because bitcoin has all the qualities to make for an ideal money, to a greater extent than any digital or tangible commodity on the planet. Second, in contrast with traditional fiat money, bitcoin is designed for the internet; it’s open source, it’s mobile, fast, and it allows for personal privacy. Third, because we are approaching a bankruptcy event in the developed economies, both in banks and governments, I think that bitcoin, as a discrete and nonconfiscatable currency, will benefit greatly from the capital flight that will ensue.”</p><p>As more people around the world have realized Demeester is right about this nascent digital currency, his own perspective has continued to grow. In the introductory note to Adamant’s landmark research paper from 2019, “<a href="https://casebitcoin.com/docs/TheBitcoinReformation_TuurDemeester.pdf">The Bitcoin Reformation</a>,” Demeester made the case that bitcoin was not merely a new kind of money, but represented a fundamental shift with few precedents in history.</p><p>“In the past I’ve drawn parallels between bitcoin and the early petroleum industry, the search engine wars, the domain name markets, the growth of P2P file sharing, and internet protocols,” he explained. “But I kept feeling that I was failing to fundamentally grasp the magnitude of the epoch in which bitcoin functions as a catalyst. It wasn’t until I studied the era around the Protestant Reformation that I felt I’d found a potential blueprint of sufficient scope.”</p><p>Demeester continues to develop one of the most sought-after perspectives in Bitcoin and now he’s preparing to share that perspective at the upcoming Bitcoin 2023 event in Miami.</p><p>“I have a new report, ‘<a href="https://unchained.com/how-to-position-bitcoin-boom">How To Position For The Bitcoin Boom</a>,’ which I’m happy to talk about in Miami,” he told Bitcoin Magazine in an interview about the event. “I can’t say much as to the content right now, but rest assured it will be bullish on bitcoin. In general, my aim is always to inspire people to think for themselves by providing good source information and perspectives that they hadn’t considered before.”</p><p>Of course, today’s global, macroeconomic climate is one that will produce a lot of compelling Bitcoin content at the largest annual event dedicated to showcasing it. And this year is one that is bringing some of Demeester’s earliest insights about Bitcoin to fruition.</p><p>“It’s hard to predict the very short term, but my view for 2023 is that quantitative easing will make a comeback, and hence that we’ll see a surge of new inflation, in particular in rising commodity prices,” he said. “That is enormously bullish for bitcoin, because it’s one of the few true inflation hedges out there.”</p><p>The event will also be a chance to reflect on the progress Bitcoin is making as a technology, independent of BTC’s value relative to fiat currency or the erosion of the legacy financial system. With an outlook that has experienced numerous bear and bull cycles, Demeester is optimistic about how the current environment will produce more advanced and resilient Bitcoin projects.</p><p>“In bear markets, developers, entrepreneurs, politicians and other Bitcoin actors tend to take their time working on projects because they know that announcements — no matter how impressive — will generally see very little interest,” Demeester said. “I expect a huge amount of exciting announcements to come out in 2023, even though I can’t yet predict where exactly they will come from. I’m expecting serious progress in nation-state adoption, in Lightning technology, in bitcoin mining and in the use of bitcoin as a financial performance benchmark, and in bitcoin-backed mortgages.”</p><p>Finally, Demeester — a veteran of Bitcoin events, big and small, in bear markets and bull markets — is looking forward to checking in with the Bitcoin 2023 attendees who he’s known throughout his long and expansive career in the space, as well as meeting the new ones who will help take that journey into the future.</p><p>“I look forward to catching up with friends, some of whom I haven’t met in a long time, and also of course to meet new people,” Demeester concluded. “Bitcoin conferences like Bitcoin 2023 are so fun because they gather Bitcoin people from all around the world together in one place.”</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk3NTQ3MTU5MDIzODU0NTk4/tuur-demeester-1.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trammell Venture Partners Releases Venture Industry’s First Bitcoin-Native Startup Ecosystem Research]]></title><description><![CDATA[The report examines the growth of the industry and highlights the discrepancy between bitcoin’s dominance and the level of investment bitcoin startups receive.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/tvp-releases-venture-industrys-first-bitcoin-startup-ecosystem-research</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/tvp-releases-venture-industrys-first-bitcoin-startup-ecosystem-research</guid><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Startups]]></category><category><![CDATA[Trammell Venture Partners]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[VC]]></category><category><![CDATA[Venture]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 27 Apr 2023 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwMzYwODg2MzE2MTE1MzQ4/draper-moon-rocket-bitcoin-studio-demo-pitch.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><a href="https://tvp.fund/">Trammell Venture Partners</a> (TVP), an Austin-based venture capital firm focused on Bitcoin, has released the venture industry's first Bitcoin-native startup ecosystem research.

The report also highlighted the misallocation of capital for Bitcoin startups and the gap in institutional venture capital for founders focused on the Bitcoin tech stack and ecosystem.</p><p>Christopher Calicott, TVP’s managing director and founding partner, commented in a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine that “Bitcoin — the first, best, and only truly decentralized ‘crypto’ asset — is becoming a platform at an accelerating pace.

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Hongumart, a frontline healthcare worker.</em></p><p>Bitcoin is often praised for its innovative design, its resistance to censorship and corruption and its potential to revolutionize the global financial system. </p><p>But beyond these practical aspects, Bitcoin also has a deeper philosophical dimension. In this vein, Bitcoin can be seen as an expression of "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_mathematics">pure mathematics</a>," a manifestation of the beauty and elegance of mathematical logic and principles. </p><p>Pure mathematics is the study of mathematical concepts independent of any real-world applications. Pure mathematicians are interested in logic, basic principles and the properties and structures of abstract objects, and their findings may originate from practical problems or be put to use for practical solutions, but they are working from a more philosophical viewpoint than applied mathematicians are.</p><p>One way that Bitcoin expresses pure math is through its use of algorithms and protocols. Bitcoin relies on a set of rules and procedures that are defined by mathematical equations and functions. These rules and procedures govern how transactions are validated, how new bitcoin are created, how the network reaches consensus and how the system adapts to changing conditions. These algorithms and protocols are transparent, deterministic and verifiable. They ensure that Bitcoin operates in a consistent and predictable manner, regardless of human intervention or manipulation and are ultimately independent of any specific real-world environments or attempts at disruption. </p><p>Another way that Bitcoin expresses pure math is through its use of cryptography. Cryptography is the science of encoding and decoding information using math and it is considered by many to be one of the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/pure-mathematics/about-pure-math/what-is-pure-math#:~:text=Finance%20and%20cryptography%20are%20current,is%20applied%20in%20significant%20ways.">most powerful applications for pure mathematics</a>. Bitcoin uses cryptography to protect the privacy and security of its users and their transactions. For example, Bitcoin uses public-key cryptography to enable users to generate unique digital signatures that prove their ownership of their bitcoin. It also uses hash functions to create cryptographic puzzles that miners have to solve in order to add new blocks to the blockchain. These cryptographic methods are based on well-established mathematical theories and assumptions.</p><p>Bitcoin is more than just a currency or a technology. While it is essentially open-source software, its application of pure mathematics also makes it a form of art and expression that showcases the beauty and power of this philosophical field.</p><p>By using mathematical logic and principles to create a decentralized and secure system, Bitcoin demonstrates how mathematical concepts developed purely for their philosophical merits can be applied to solve real-world problems and challenges. By using mathematical techniques and methods to protect the privacy and security of its users, Bitcoin shows how math can be used to enhance human rights and freedoms. By using mathematical symbols and representations to encode and manipulate information, Bitcoin reveals how math can be used to communicate and create meaning. </p><p>Bitcoin is an expression of pure mathematics that appeals to both the rational and the aesthetic aspects of human nature. It challenges us to think critically and creatively about the nature and role of money, information and trust in our society. It invites us to appreciate the beauty and elegance of mathematical logic and principles that underlie its design and operation. It inspires us to explore the possibilities and potentials of pure math in our world.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Hongumart.

Bitcoin might be most closely related to the Fedwire Funds Service which only settles about 200 million transactions per year compared to Bitcoin’s trailing 1-year figure of 98.5 million transactions.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1540011820332769281"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p><em><a href="https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1540011820332769281">Link to embedded tweet.</a></em></p><p>As it stands today, the Bitcoin network is on pace to settle $3.5 trillion worth of change-adjusted value over the course of 2023, for costs of just $198 million, an equivalent fee rate of 0.006% for the average transaction. While average transaction costs are obviously skewed by the largest transfers in the data set, we can look at the median transaction settlement value and account for the median transaction fee, and still see that on-chain bitcoin transactions are a tremendously efficient way to send and receive value in a trustless manner over the internet.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Despite bitcoin’s extreme efficiencies as a global immutable settlement network, it remained unideal for minuscule and instantaneous transfers, as the 10-minute block interval target adds a latency to the settlement of transactions. This is okay for large sums of money, evidenced by the incumbent financial system, where net settlement of funds between financial intermediaries often don’t finalize for days or weeks on end — think MasterCard or Visa settling their books on a net basis with a banking institution like JPMorgan. </p><p>However, the need for a sound internet money that could settle instantaneously for nearly no cost was still there. With the advent of the Lightning Network, the latency involved with sending a bitcoin transaction, particularly for micropayment settlements, has all but vanished. This has brought about a whole new use case for bitcoin, as the monetary medium is now finding itself being inserted into the tech stacks of web applications and services across the globe.</p><p>As a refresher and overly simplified description, the Lightning Network works by node runners doing an on-chain transaction to open up payment channels with other nodes. This adds liquidity to the network and creates a network of channels when enough users open channels to one another. Lightning payments are sent from one node and hop across other nodes who have enough liquidity in their channels until the payment reaches its intended destination.</p><p>By doing one on-chain payment to open a channel, funds on the Lightning Network are able to move with less friction and settle without waiting for 10-minute periods between blocks for each transaction, until the channel gets closed with another on-chain transaction. These channels allow for lower fees as payments only pay to hop across nodes that have liquidity in their channels.</p><p>With a refresher on the technical workings out of the way, let’s take a look at the costs of the Bitcoin settlement stack compared to current retail settlement options like credit cards and focus on the massive efficiency gains of the Lightning Network in particular. Shown below, we compare the upper- and lower-bound costs of legacy payment processors to the median settlement cost of a Bitcoin on-chain transaction — median fee paid divided by median transaction volume — and the Lightning median fee rate percentage for sending the equivalent of 1 BTC. </p><p>We acknowledge that the comparison between the median cost of a bitcoin on-chain transaction to legacy payment processing costs isn’t quite an apples-to-apples comparison because credit card processors allow for near instantaneous payments to be made (but not settled!). That being said, this is where the vast efficiencies of the Lightning Network come into play.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>The two charts above demonstrate how much more cheaply the Lightning Network is settling payments when compared to credit card processors.</p><p>Yes, legacy payment processors facilitate the transfer of trillions of dollars a year, which dwarfs the Lightning Network’s settlement volume. As a side note, it isn’t possible to quantify the transfer volume of Lightning like it is with on-chain transactions. Given the relative size of the Lightning Network, it is vital to remember that the network has continued to grow exponentially, while facilitating instantaneous transfer for near-to-no cost, all the while growing ever more connected. </p><p>In addition to cheaper settlement, the Lightning Network is also facilitating payments 60,000% to 140,000% more efficiently than credit cards.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>While it may be a bit of a stretch to directly compare the median lightning payment fee to that of a multinational credit card processing firm, particularly given the minuscule micropayments of many Lightning transactions, the nature of public Lightning channels and transactions means that this technology is very capable of scaling to accommodate much larger transactions if/when needed. There is already indirect evidence of this happening with the average size of public channels pushing all-time highs in both BTC and USD terms at the time of writing.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><h3>Final Note:</h3><p>First enabled by the Segwit soft fork in 2017, the Lightning Network has gone from a conceptual idea to a flourishing global ecosystem in the span of less than six years. Reminiscent of the early days of the internet, Lighting Network nodes and user participation has gone from niche hyper-technical software developers to the edge of mainstream adoption in a short amount of time.</p><p>While the Lightning Network may not be headline news, the technology enabled by Lightning — the ability to direct a digitally native bearer asset in a trustless manner across the internet for nearly no cost — is an extremely significant development in the history of payment networks, and it is the first to do so in an open and decentralized manner. </p><p>We are extremely bullish on the continued development and adoption of the Lightning Network, and think that the advent of a common open-standard for sending and receiving internet-native value instantaneously for extremely low costs may be the killer app that brings bitcoin to a billion people.</p><p>It’s helpful to compare the early days of the internet to where Bitcoin is in its lifecycle. Looking at the growth of the two networks below can give us a small glimpse into where Bitcoin and Lightning may be heading as adoption increases.</p><p>How the internet started:</p><figure>

In February 2021, Tulip Trading issued a “Letter Before Action” announcing its intention to take legal action against certain Bitcoin developers to recover the allegedly lost bitcoin.</p><p>Should the UK courts rule in Tulip Trading’s favor, open-source developers could be considered fiduciaries to users of software that they have contributed to, even in projects without any formal assumption of duty or compensation for costs and associated risks. Alex Morcos, the co-founder of Chaincode Labs and the Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund, said, "the Tulip Trading case threatens not only the MIT License but also the very notion of freedom of speech."</p><p>Craig Wright has also brought a second lawsuit against Bitcoin developers in which he alleges that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, and thus owns the copyright for the Bitcoin Whitepaper and the database rights for the Bitcoin blockchain. <br><br>Should Wright be successful, “it would, in the eyes of the law, allow Craig Wright ultimate control over the Bitcoin network,” a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine says. However, it should be noted that Bitcoin is a protocol and network made up of all its participants worldwide. Bitcoin can not be controlled by any one individual, institution, or government. The law cannot give anyone complete control over the Bitcoin network.</p><p>Jess Jonas, the Chief Legal Officer of the Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund, said: "We believe that these lawsuits are frivolous, but we still have to oppose them vigorously … fighting for the right of developers to create free and open-source software without fear of legal retaliation.” <br><br>Jack Dorsey, CEO of Block and co-founder of the Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund, said, "the outcomes of these cases are important for everyone, even those who may not be interested in Bitcoin, because these lawsuits could have serious detrimental effects on open-source development writ large, which will negatively impact our lives in ways we may not even realize until it’s too late."</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MjMxNzYxODMwNDIyMDIx/security-lock-and-fingerprint-key.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Great Restoration: How Bitcoin Can Fix The Art World]]></title><description><![CDATA[The traditional art market is opaque, exclusive and difficult for creators to navigate.

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Rebel Money, a visual artist who focuses on Bitcoin themes and advocates for other artists in the space.</em></p><p>For centuries, the traditional art market has been dominated by established auction houses and galleries, where works of art are sold for millions of dollars. Despite its longevity, the art market has been criticized for its opaqueness, exclusivity and the difficulties faced by new collectors when navigating its intricacies. In fact, it has <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/art-market-we-know-could-thing-past-anders-cederholm-nielsen/">been described as</a> "the most corrupt industry in the world." </p><p>Given that Bitcoin was designed to counter large, corrupt monetary policies, many wonder if it can also disrupt the shady and unscrupulous practices of the art world. If so, how might Bitcoin achieve this transformation?</p><h2>Closed Source</h2><p>From an artist's perspective in the traditional art world, comprehending the intricate economics of selling their artwork and where the funds end up is a daunting task. Unfortunately, artists are often left in the dark about the financial aspects of their craft, which can be disheartening and even exploitative. </p><p>There appears to be a deliberate effort to infantilize the artists, depriving them of a comprehensive understanding of the financial transactions involving their work, and rendering them vulnerable to manipulation by powerful intermediaries in the industry. Art galleries are not immune to such practices, as they take advantage of the complex processes involved in the purchase of artworks, which typically requires the involvement of multiple intermediaries such as banks, auction houses and art dealers. </p><p>This can create a sort of sleight of hand, making it easier for galleries to obscure the actual sale value of artwork, and resulting in the artist being kept in the dark about the true value of their work. </p><p>The murky economic model applies not just to artists but also for new collectors trying to navigate the market. Large galleries often change prices depending on who they are selling to, which can make it difficult for new collectors to acquire pieces. This tactic allows galleries to maintain control over who owns the art, limit the supply and ensure that the art will not end up in the secondary market, leading to a <a href="https://mises.org/wire/cantillon-effects-why-inflation-helps-some-and-hurts-others">Cantillon-style effect</a>.</p><p>In addition to the challenges faced by new collectors, museums and prestigious collectors often have access to special work and can pay less for pieces. Having their names associated with certain pieces can also boost the value of the artwork. For example, the Guggenheim has <a href="https://qz.com/103091/high-end-art-is-one-of-the-most-manipulated-markets-in-the-world">reportedly received discounts of 30% or more</a> for certain pieces because of their association with the museum. </p><p>These pricing tactics and exclusivity practices can leave new collectors feeling frustrated and unable to acquire pieces, no matter the cost. Even celebrities like Daniel Radcliffe, known for his role in the “Harry Potter” movies, have been turned down when trying to acquire pieces. <a href="https://observer.com/2012/02/harry-potter-and-the-boring-art-fair-story/">Radcliffe told Time Out London</a> that, in 2012, he attempted to purchase a Jim Hodges piece but was told, "No, we’re waiting for a more prestigious collector to take that."</p><p>While it may be tempting to assume that large auctions at industry giants such as Sotheby's or Christie's are fair and open, the reality is that the price of art at auction can still be manipulated. Despite the seemingly-transparent nature of auctions, there are still ways for insiders to control the outcomes. One example is the practice of "<a href="https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-auction-house-buzzwords-new-collectors">chandelier bidding</a>," where an auctioneer takes extra phantom bids from non-existent bidders in order to artificially inflate the price of a piece. This technique is used to create an illusion of competition, driving up the price and creating a sense of urgency among bidders. In addition to chandelier bidding, collectors may also bid on lots simply to raise the bidding temperature, even if they have no real interest in the accompanying piece, in order to protect the value of their existing collection. </p><p>As a result, auction prices may not always reflect the true market rates, and may instead be influenced by these behind-the-scenes tactics.</p><h2>Can Bitcoin Fix This?</h2><p>The use of Bitcoin in the art world has the potential to address the issues of corruption and inequality in the industry. Bitcoin offers a more efficient and transparent transaction mechanism, eliminating the need for multiple intermediaries and enabling immediate payment for artists after the sale of their artwork.</p><p>However, the human layer of Bitcoin adoption in the art world is complex. While Bitcoin has the potential to be a powerful tool for good, it can also be misused by those with malicious intentions. Nonetheless, Bitcoin has the ability to incentivize ethical behavior in the art world. As Bitcoin is not subject to inflationary pressures, it reduces the exploitation of artists in revenue sharing and eliminates the need for potentially-questionable practices.</p><p>Bitcoin auction sites such as <a href="https://scarce.city/">Scarce.City</a> and <a href="https://plebeian.market/">Plebeian Market</a> have recognized the gap in the market and are leveraging Bitcoin's capabilities to create a more ethical approach to art sales. By charging lower fees and offering a transparent bidding process open to all, these companies aim to disrupt the traditional gallery and auctioneering worlds. With direct payments to artists and collectors after the auction, the use of Bitcoin in the art world could bring more fairness and transparency to the industry.</p><h2>P(ower)2P(ainters)</h2><p>And Bitcoin's disruptive potential extends beyond just providing a more efficient and transparent means of buying and selling art. It has the power to fundamentally change the traditional art world's structure by offering a decentralized, peer-to-peer relationship between artists and collectors. This shift is crucial because it enables artists to have direct relationships with their collectors, rather than relying on galleries to control access to their work.</p><p>In the conventional art market, the artist's relationship with the collector is often non-existent, and it is the gallery that dictates who gets to collect the artwork. However, with Bitcoin, artists have the opportunity to create beautiful and meaningful relationships with their collectors, as both parties navigate and learn from each other. This relationship-building process is facilitated by the fact that Bitcoin enables transactions to occur directly between artists and collectors, without intermediaries.</p><p>The emergence of digital art collectibles, such as Counterparty tokens, Ordinals and Rare Pepes, has further amplified this effect. With these digital art collectibles, artists can easily send their pieces to collectors around the world and reward them with additional sub-assets in the future. This new dynamic empowers artists to grow their work organically as their relationships with their collectors develop.</p><h2>Fake Rares</h2><p>Counterfeiting and the forgery of artworks have plagued the art industry for centuries and continue to be major concerns for galleries, auction houses and collectors. In fact, the Fine Art Expert Institute's report suggests that the market for fake artworks is worth approximately <a href="https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/arts-and-culture/a12108723/fake-art-how-to-avoid-scams/">$6 billion per year</a>. Moreover, in some categories of artwork, the percentage of fake artworks may <a href="https://www.widewalls.ch/magazine/more-then-half-of-art-is-fake">reach as high as 70%</a>. To make matters worse, <a href="https://www.insider.com/cases-of-faked-and-forged-artwork-2019-1">some experts suggest</a> that up to 20% of art pieces displayed in museums around the world could be counterfeit.</p><p>The rise of Bitcoin presents an opportunity to combat art forgery and counterfeiting through its immutable ledger. This technology can provide a transparent and secure platform for art sales, addressing the issue of authenticity and provenance. By embedding tokens in physical art pieces or digital art, these assets can be tracked transparently from owner to owner, ensuring that the buyer is purchasing a piece of authentic art.</p><p>This method of tracking art pieces has significant potential to mitigate the risk of forgeries and counterfeits in the art market. It also offers art collectors and investors a transparent way to purchase art pieces with confidence, knowing that they are genuine and have a reliable provenance. Furthermore, it may discourage counterfeiters from creating fake artworks altogether, as their creations can be easily detected and traced back to the source, leading to legal consequences. As such, Bitcoin can play a pivotal role in reducing the circulation of fake art, ensuring that the art industry remains a safe and secure place for art collectors, investors and enthusiasts.</p><h2>1494 All Over Again</h2><p>More and more art and artists are being drawn to Bitcoin every day. This is not a surprise, as creators are primed for adoption of Bitcoin. Artists know that proof of work and energy transmutation have always been a part of the alchemical process of painting. Selling artwork for sats is an artist's way of mining.</p><p>With greater adoption, Bitcoin principles such as leveraging open-source information, emphasizing transparency, remaining borderless and promoting decentralization will influence the traditional art market through the nuts and bolts of the network and, perhaps more importantly, the culture and behavior surrounding it.</p><p>It gives artists and collectors new tools to sell art and forge relationships directly. While there will always be a role for the gallerist, transparency is the basis for growth in Bitcoin art, and building off of it can create a more ethical and creative ecosystem.</p><p>In 1494, the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2012/10/04/162296423/the-accountant-who-changed-the-world">invention of double-entry accounting</a> ushered in a new era of human prosperity and a golden age of artistic expression. While it’s not a silver bullet, Bitcoin offers a real hope of echoing history and paving the way for a Renaissance in the art world in terms of creativity, freedom and ethics. Embrace the great restoration.</p><p><strong><u><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1rqRbWHeYtwtb1OHKMs0d5?si=2me3VzVZQGOI3hn7xqJ6og&amp;nd=1">For more, listen to the Bitcoin Magazine Podcast episode featuring a conversation between Rebel Money, Dennis Koch and X Nardo.</a></u></strong></p><p><em>This is a guest post by Rebel Money.

The filing follows a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2022/petn4-789.pdf">July 2022 petition</a> from Coinbase asking the SEC to use formal rulemaking to provide guidance for the crypto sector. Coinbase claims that the SEC has not yet responded to its petition, so it has filed the legal challenge to compel the SEC to respond either positively or negatively to its request.</p><p>The Administrative Procedure Act requires the SEC to respond to Coinbase’s rulemaking petition “within a reasonable time.” If the SEC decides not to respond, Coinbase will have the right to challenge that decision in court. Coinbase does not seek to dictate the SEC’s response, only to require that the agency responds at all, according to a<a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbase-takes-another-formal-step-to-seek-regulatory-clarity-from-sec-for"> statement released by the company.</a></p><p>Coinbase and other crypto firms are facing potential regulatory enforcement actions from the SEC, even though the agency has not stated its position on the application of the law to the crypto sector. Coinbase asserts that regulatory clarity is long overdue for the industry, and that new rules would be “a critical step to giving the public notice about what activities they can and cannot engage in.”</p><p>Coinbase said it recognizes that clear rules are needed for the industry and has asked for rules to be developed. The exchange’s decision to challenge the SEC is an attempt to compel basic rulemaking, according to the firm. Coinbase added that it will continue to take every step available to seek regulatory clarity until the industry gets that clarity. </p><p>Chief Legal Officer at Coinbase Paul Grewal said in <a href="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1650655478014410753?s=20">a statement on Twitter</a> that “The crypto industry, and its users need clear laws and rules to follow that are built for a new technology. Enforcement actions based in inapplicable securities law aren’t the answer.”</p><p>Coinbase has faced regulatory hurdles in the past, leading to it <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/americas-largest-bitcoin-exchange-is-considering-leaving-the-country">potentially seeking</a> to move out of the United States. The exchange also <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/sec-sue-coinbase-lend-yield-product">halted plans</a> to launch a lending product following warnings from regulators.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MzI5NzY4OTU4MTc0ODk3/bitcoin-legal-regulation.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bitcoin Magazine Books Releases “The Philosophy Of Bitcoin"]]></title><description><![CDATA[Álvaro D.

María in English. The book was originally published in Spanish in 2022 as "La Filosofía de Bitcoin" and received much attention for its unique exploration of Bitcoin's disruptive nature to civilization. Ellen Sullivan, the publisher of Bitcoin Magazine Books, said that it's a great privilege to work with Álvaro and to deliver his groundbreaking work to English-speaking readers. "We plan to honor that commitment with a launch that we hope will be heard around the world. Everyone, Bitcoiners or not, should read this book."</p><p>"The Philosophy of Bitcoin" delves into the nature of Bitcoin and its political implications. The author, Álvaro D. María, with his unique background in philosophy and law, analyzes its innovations and explains why institutions are being challenged as a result of Bitcoin's emergence. In the book, he argues that Bitcoin is comparable to other revolutionary technologies like gunpowder or the internet. Through a deep philosophical exploration, readers will learn how Bitcoin is changing the way we think about money, power, and the role of the State in society.</p><p>According to María, "Bitcoin redefines the right to property by making it absolute and poses a new challenge to states, opening the door to new political forms by changing the current bargaining power. If gunpowder accelerated the passage from the Middle Ages to the Modern Age, Bitcoin will help accelerate the passage to the Information Age."</p><p>"The Philosophy of Bitcoin" is available now in the <a href="https://store.bitcoinmagazine.com/collections/books">Bitcoin Magazine Shop</a>, and Álvaro D. María will be signing copies of his book at <a href="http://b.tc/conference">Bitcoin 2023</a> at the Book Signing Booth. This is a unique opportunity for readers to meet the author and delve deeper into the ideas presented in his book. Bitcoin Magazine Books is committed to bringing high-quality, thought-provoking literature about Bitcoin to a wider audience. "The Philosophy of Bitcoin" is the latest addition to their growing catalog of Bitcoin-related books. They are excited to share this book with their readers and look forward to continuing to publish more works that explore the fascinating world of Bitcoin.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzMDI2MTUyOTY3Nzc1OTUy/the-thinker-bitcoin-philosophy.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bitcoin Magazine Launches El Salvador Cover Edition Ordinals Giveaway]]></title><description><![CDATA[Bitcoiners will have the opportunity to show how much they disrespect banks and love Bitcoin while potentially earning a Cover Edition ordinal.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-magazine-launches-el-salvador-cover-ordinals-giveaway</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-magazine-launches-el-salvador-cover-ordinals-giveaway</guid><category><![CDATA[Ordinals]]></category><category><![CDATA[Print Magazine]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin magazine]]></category><category><![CDATA[Inscriptions]]></category><category><![CDATA[el salvador]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 25 Apr 2023 14:05:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk3NDkxNTM0MzY1NDY3NjU0/image1.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

We constantly transact in money, think in money and strive to earn more of it. However, few genuinely understand what money is, and even those who do often perceive it in very different ways. </p><p>Some say that money is a form of energy that can be transformed and exchanged. Others see it as a technological tool that facilitates trade and commerce. Still others argue that money is a social construct shaped and governed by cultural norms and values. All these views can be correct since the concept of money is much deeper than the way it is commonly framed. </p><p>Our perspectives on money shape our views on how we use it. Money assumes various forms, spanning physical tender, precious metals, bank deposits, credit and, more recently, bitcoin. The most recognized form of money today is physical tender, encompassing coins and paper notes, which are distributed by the government. </p><h2>So, What is Money? </h2><p>Money is, first and foremost, a means to transact, to purchase goods and services. This function is commonly referred to as a <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/medium-of-exchange">medium of exchange</a>. It is a good you acquire not for its own sake but merely as a <em>means</em> to purchase another good.</p><ul><li>✅ Money is a market good, a good you acquire in order to acquire other goods. For this to happen, the market (sellers) must accept it as a medium of exchange.</li><li>❌ Money is not a consumption good, goods that directly satisfy consumer wants and needs. (Examples: a shirt, a pair of shoes, bread, cola, etc.)</li><li>❌ Money is not a capital good, which are physical assets that an organization uses to manufacture products and services that consumers will use later — e.g., machines, tools, vehicles, buildings, etc.</li></ul><p>How we conceptualize and understand money has evolved over time, and different schools of thought have emerged regarding its nature and function. </p><p>Karl Marx would say that money is the product of a commodity economy, where the source and nature of money are based on the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/labor-theory-of-value.asp">labor theory of value</a>, while Carl Menger, the founder of the Austrian school of economics, defined money as the relative ability for goods to be sold in a given market at a given time and price — a good’s “salability.” The most salable good is the good chosen to facilitate indirect trade based on the lowest rate of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lawofdiminishingutility.asp">declining marginal utility</a>. </p><p>Proponents of the Austrian school would say that the supply of money is either extremely durable in relation to current production — as it was under the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/gold-standard">gold standard.</a> Another view is that money is determined exogenously by a government authority — a position often taken by many of today’s economists, educated in a largely Keynesian paradigm. In recent history, the choice has been either gold or government.</p><p>The global economy has undergone significant changes since money’s last fleeting connection to gold ended in 1971. The fiat standard has enabled central banks to print money with complete discretion, leading to inflation and currency devaluation. Digital money ushered in novel opportunities for enhanced global trade and investment while intensifying competition and economic uncertainty. The shift to untethered money has brought forth a plethora of advantages and disadvantages, which shape today’s economic landscape.</p><h2>Why Do We Need Money? </h2><p>Money is necessary for a society that wants to trade, as it facilitates exchange and allows us to meet our basic survival needs — like shelter, food and clothing — and enables us to live within specific security and safety standards.</p><p>Without the invention of money, people would still be using barter or keeping ledgers of credit and debt. Barter works well when the needs and supplies of two parties match, as they can simply exchange these items directly without any monetary medium.. This is called the coincidence of wants or the double coincidence of wants.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2ODU0NTY4OTcyMTk4OTc0/coincidence-of-wants.png" height="349" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>It’s immediately apparent that a barter economy restricts the ability to trade, as it requires people to possess goods (preferably non-perishable) that they are willing to swap. They must also find other people who want the goods you own, and lastly, you must want the goods they possess. The coincidence of wants does not support a scalable monetary system. </p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2ODU0NTgyNjYyNDA3ODEw/barter-doesn_t-scale.png" height="349" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>The solution is for society — or the market — to agree on an efficient good that will enable the exchange of products and services between all market participants. Money removes the necessity to find a particular person to barter with while offering a market to exchange your goods or services for a common medium of exchange. You will use that medium to buy what you need from others who also accept it as money.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>By providing the optionality, money is the best natural mechanism to save for the future. It allows economies to thrive by increasing trade and commerce; modern economies could simply not exist without money. </p><p>With little access to money, our freedoms and time are limited as we are forced to spend most of our time working to obtain the money necessary to cover the basic necessities. Having access to more money is empowering, as it allows us to make more informed decisions about the hours we need to work and the goods and services we consume — the neighborhood we live in, the car we drive, the restaurants we eat at and even the healthcare we choose.</p><p>It also provides beneficial opportunities for our children, as parents can afford better food, better education and a better way to pass on their wealth, assuming that the money can hold its value through time — which is one of the three universally accepted functions of money. </p><h2>Functions of Money </h2><p>Money has taken different forms over the years, from gold and silver to glass beads in Africa or wampum used by Native Americans. What’s remained constant across continents and throughout history is that money must perform the following three functions: a medium of exchange, a unit of account and a store of value.</p><p>1.&nbsp;<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/medium-of-exchange"><strong>Medium of exchange</strong></a>: Money serves as a medium of exchange when it allows people to trade goods and services easily without resorting to barter. This simplifies transactions and makes commerce more efficient.</p><p>As an intermediary between the products or services people want to trade, money is a suitable medium of exchange. “[money] is not acquired for its own properties, but for its salability.” – “The Bitcoin Standard,”<em> </em>Saifedean Ammous.</p><p>2.&nbsp;<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/unit-of-account"><strong>Unit of Account</strong></a>: Money provides a standard measure of value, enabling people to compare the worth of different goods and services. A consistent price allows people to measure the market value of goods, services, economic activities, assets and liabilities. The price is what indicates the measurement of a good’s market value relative to other goods on the market.</p><p>When goods, services, assets or salaries are quoted in a recognizable unit of account, it allows buyers and sellers to quickly determine if a trade is worthwhile. Prices expressed in a unit of account lets market participants decide to operate complex tasks, accumulate capital or engage in economic calculations.</p><p>3.&nbsp;<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/store-of-value"><strong>Store of Value</strong></a>: Money serves as a store of value, allowing individuals and organizations to save and store wealth through time, without its value deteriorating. Current expectations of future supply and demand for an asset drive the ability of something to be a good store of value.</p><p>A store of value must be a durable good with limited supply issuance. Consumption goods such as milk and capital goods like machinery or cars are poor stores of value because they can perish, corrode, depreciate or lose value over time.</p><p>Andreas Antonopoulos, a long-time Bitcoin educator, argues that technology and network systems in the modern era may have given rise to a darker side of money. He introduced a fourth function:</p><p>4.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyK4P7ZdOK8"><strong>System of Control</strong></a> (external link): Money as a system of control refers to how money can be manipulated to serve political agendas. This has turned financial services companies into deputies of the system. As deputies, they get certain perks, such as never going to jail, but this has come at the expense of corruption and economic exclusion.</p><p>When money is used as a system of control, it corrupts its other functions, including its ability to serve as a medium of exchange and store of value. Money abused in this way works to the advantage of corrupt politicians and dictators, as it ensures that political dissent can be censored very effectively by limiting transactions or blocking purchases.</p><p>In the 20th century, governments monopolized the issuance of money and continually undermined its use as a store of value, creating a false narrative that money is primarily a medium of exchange. Money that doesn’t store value into the future results in a society that concerns itself less about the future.</p><p>Sound money, in contrast, is defined as money with a purchasing power determined by markets, independent of governments. Market participants, left to their own devices, naturally select a monetary medium that best fulfills the three functions of money. To achieve this status, it needs to have strong monetary properties. </p><h2>Properties of Money</h2><p>There are six widely accepted properties of money and it has been this way for centuries. So long as an item has these properties, it’s a good candidate for becoming money. Whichever monetary candidate records the highest score against these properties is likely to be used as the de facto unit of trade. </p><h3>Standard properties: </h3><ol><li><strong>Durable</strong> — Money must be durable to be passed around and used repeatedly without the danger of wear and damage and the consequent depreciation of its value.</li><li><strong>Portable</strong> — Money should be easy to transport, physically or digitally, so that it can be transferred in trade. Cash and gold are portable in small quantities, yet more significant amounts can be challenging to move over long distances or through border controls. </li><li><strong>Divisible</strong> — Money must be capable of being divided into smaller parts. For example, a $10 bill can be exchanged for two $5 bills without diminishing its (combined) value. A cow or a stone, on the other hand, is not divisible. </li><li><strong>Fungible</strong> — Money should be completely interchangeable: one dollar should always be equal to another dollar, the same way two $5 bills are interchangeable with one $10 bill.</li><li><strong>Scarcity</strong> — Scarcity, or limited supply, is another essential property of sound money. Computer scientist Nick Szabo defined scarcity as “unforgeable costliness,” meaning the cost of creating something cannot be faked. If money is too plentiful, it loses value over time as more units can and will be created, and more will be required to purchase a good or service.</li><li><strong>Verifiable</strong> — Money should be a verifiable record accepted as a medium of exchange to pay for goods and services or to repay a debt in a specific country. It should be easy to recognize and hard to counterfeit; otherwise, it would lose value for payment purposes and would be rejected by vendors.</li></ol><p>Each of these properties underpins the functions of money, encapsulated by Erik Yakes below as well as in his <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-dimensions-of-money">series on the dimensions of money.</a> Clearly, owning a scarce good that’s durable is a good means of storing value through time. But that’s not enough to make something money; it also has to be desirable, or acceptable and portable if it is to be used in exchange for other goods and services. Once this is achieved, it can become a unit of account so long as it’s divisible and fungible. </p><figure>

    </figure><p>Since the invention of digital money, three additional monetary properties can be considered, including established history, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/uphill-battle-bitcoin-ban">censorship resistance</a> and programmability, which have significantly impacted how we perceive and use money in the digital age.</p><h3>Additional Properties: </h3><ol><li><strong>Established history</strong> — The Lindy effect suggests that the life expectancy of certain non-perishable entities, such as technologies or ideas, is directly related to their current age. In essence, the longer these entities have survived and remained relevant, the greater their chances of continued existence into the future. This longevity indicates resistance to change, obsolescence or competition, which increases their chance of survival over time.</li><li><strong>Censorship resistance</strong> — Decentralization ensures that nobody, nowhere, can have their money confiscated or blocked from usage. Censorship resistance is a relatively new monetary property for those who want to be sure their wealth is untouchable.</li><li><strong>Smart/Programmable</strong> — Typically refers to blockchain technology systems which allow certain conditions to be met before money can be spent. It’s a mechanism for specifying the automated behavior of that money through a computer program. </li></ol><p>Money does not need to be “backed” by anything; it only needs these properties to have value. </p><p>The idea that money must be backed by something only exists because paper money was once redeemable or “backed by” gold, where intrinsically useless fiat money piggybacked onto gold’s valuable properties.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Bitcoin promises to be the next step in the evolution of money. It’s built upon the same properties that once made gold the de facto monetary medium for centuries, only it’s been enhanced with the additional properties of extreme portability and fungibility — those very properties that allowed fiat to usurp gold during the last century.</p><p>Unlike gold and fiat, bitcoin is built for the digital age. Its supply is strictly regulated by its code and enforced by those who use it. It’s a system of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-and-a-world-of-rules-without-rulers">rules without rulers</a>, that allows transactions to be transmitted globally in mere seconds and settled within minutes without incurring the exorbitant expenses and approval typically associated with traditional financial systems.</p><p>For the first time in history, we have a monetary system based on a distributed, immutable technology that is transparent, objective, programmable and well suited to move economic value across time and space without relying on a trusted intermediary and the issuance by central banks. Satoshi Nakamoto created peer-to-peer electronic cash that would not require trust in third parties for transactions, and its supply could not be altered by any other player. </p><p>It’s often said that gold is the king’s money, and fiat is government money. If so, then bitcoin is undoubtedly the people’s money. </p><p>Read more &gt;&gt; <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-bitcoin">What is Bitcoin</a></p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>Many who theorize about money believe that the connection to a commodity at its origin is the real reason any money could initially gain value, or hold that the support of rulers is what establishes monetary value; proponents of those arguments therefore believe that money is a creature of the state. </p><p>Money has a considerable history and has evolved numerous times. The last significant evolution marked the end of the gold standard and ushered in the beginning of fiat money. The state — via central banks — eventually destroyed two critical properties of money: soundness and sovereignty. These are the properties that enabled value to be passed down through generations. </p><p>The emergence of Bitcoin should be viewed within this scheme of things. As a medium of exchange, a global unit of account, a store of value, an international and online method for settlement, it’s conducive to individual sovereignty.</p><p>Bitcoin emerged as an alternative to government restrictions on individuals who transfer money and as an alternative to the state’s control over the money supply. As long as those premises continue to exist, then demand for bitcoin will continue to increase.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk2ODU0NTU1MjgxOTkwNzE4/what-is-money-feature-image.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2ODU0NTY4OTcyMTk4OTc0/coincidence-of-wants.png" height="349" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2ODU0NTgyNjYyNDA3ODEw/barter-doesn_t-scale.png" height="349" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2ODU0NTkwNzE1NDcwOTEw/money-as-a-medium-of-exchange.png" height="349" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2ODU0NjA3ODk1ODY0OTYy/unnamed.png" height="376" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2ODU0NjE0MzM3NzkxMDM4/currency-properties.png" height="349" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Unit of Account: A Comprehensive Guide]]></title><description><![CDATA[Unit of AccountUnit of account is the thing that measures the value of goods and services.

It's an essential function for something to be [or become?] money. In simple terms, it is a standard measure of value, a common scaling system through which the value of products can be calculated and compared.</p><p>Countries typically have distinct units of account, identified as the national or regional currency, such as the euro (EUR) or the British pound (GBP). At the same time, internationally, the U.S. dollar (USD) is the unit of account that is mainly used for global invoicing and setting prices internationally. </p><p>Unit of account is one of money’s three universally agreed <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-money">functions of <em>money</em></a> that Bitcoin Magazine is reviewing; the other two are <em><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/store-of-value">store of value</a><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-money/store-of-value"></a></em> and <em><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/medium-of-exchange">medium of exchange</a><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-money/medium-of-exchange"></a></em>.</p><h2>What is a Unit of Account</h2><p>A unit of account is whatever forms the standard measure for comparing prices with incomes or assets; it allows money users to assess the value of money and is the common denomination for transfer value across different types of goods and services. When a unit of account is defined by the same measure or denomination (such as a specific currency), it’s easier to compare the value of various assets and transactions. </p><p>Having a standard measure makes it easier to determine the value of two different items, such as the price of a house and a car. Knowing the car’s cost and the house’s price makes budgeting and transactions easier to assess.</p><p>It also allows us to process mathematical operations, such as calculating profits, losses and income, giving numerical values to what we produce, trade and consume.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Typically, what we identify as a unit of account is money — in recent times, backed by governments and national currencies. It’s what we use as a standard measure for all our daily transactions.</p><h2>Money as a Unit of Account</h2><p>Money as a unit of account is also used to measure a country’s economy. For example, the American economy is measured in U.S. dollars, the Chinese in yuan and so forth. Internationally, things tend to be simplified with the U.S. dollar as a unit of account, making it easier to compare different economies.</p><p>Money is the standard measure used in economics and financial markets to establish how much people can borrow or lend, and keep track of their assets’ value. Applicable interest rates are also calculated in the same unit of account.</p><p>Finally, money is also used to calculate the net worth of individuals, businesses and organizations of different types, including the monetary value of their assets. </p><h2>Essential Elements of a Unit of Account</h2><p>To gain acceptance as money by the market, a good typically goes through a three-stage process: starting as a store of value, progressing to a medium of exchange and finally becoming a unit of account to establish its quantifiable monetary value.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NDc5MDIyMzIwNDI4MDM4/unnamed.png" height="366" width="620">

    </figure><p>We’ve seen that a unit of account is used as a standard unit of measurement for the market value of goods and services and to be salable. For a good to be defined and credible as a unit of account, it must have the following properties:</p><p><strong>Divisibility</strong>: As a unit of account, money must be divisible into smaller units to facilitate transactions, express the value of goods and services more accurately and effectively, and compare various items’ values more easily. </p><p><strong>Fungible</strong>: Fungibility is an essential characteristic of a unit of account and occurs when two units of the same currency are interchangeable. Hence, the value of one unit of account is identical to another of the same kind. One dollar bill, for instance, has the same value as another dollar bill. Often seen as a property of a medium of exchange, its importance lies in its function rather than its classification.</p><h2>How Does Inflation Affect the Unit of Account?</h2><p>Inflation doesn't make the Unit of Account (UoA) function worse; however, price instability does make it challenging to compare the worth of goods and services over time. The unit of account serves to facilitate the understanding of supply and demand dynamics in the economy, but its reliability is severely eroded by inflation. </p><p>As a result, market participants may struggle to make informed decisions regarding consumption, investments and savings. </p><h2>What Makes a Good Unit of Account?</h2><p>Money that is divisible, and fungible makes a good unit of account. Money not impacted by inflation would make an even better unit of account. People often argue that we should have a type of money that's measurable, stable and constant, like the metric system.</p><p>If the unit of account was standardized like the metric system, it would be much easier to accurately and consistently assess the value of goods and services over time. However, value is subjective and shifting, and the world’s circumstances differ over time, so there cannot be any guarantee that value is always represented in the same way. </p><p>While we will never have a type of money that becomes as measurable as the metric system, we can have money that has a preprogrammed, inelastic supply and is detached from the real-world value of things.</p><h2>Bitcoin as a Unit of Account</h2><p>If a type of money has the primary properties discussed, is accepted globally and is also censorship resistant, it’s potentially the best unit of account ever created. </p><p>Bitcoin, however, is still relatively new and has a lot of maturing to do before it can be recognized as a consistent unit of account. Since Bitcoin has a fixed maximum supply of 21 million coins, it is not subject to the same inflationary pressures of traditional fiat currencies, which can be printed ad infinitum by central banks. This should provide a level of predictability and certainty for businesses and individuals when assessing the value of goods and services, making long-term financial planning easier and more reliable.</p><p>Furthermore, the lack of inflationary pressures on the unit of account would also promote more responsible economic decision-making by governments and businesses. Since the temptation to print more money to fund government programs or stimulate the economy would be removed, policymakers would have to find other ways to manage economic growth, such as through innovation, productivity and investment.</p><p>In addition, If bitcoin were to become the global reserve currency, it would promote greater international trade and investment by eliminating the need for currency exchanges and mitigating the risk of currency fluctuations. This would make it easier and less expensive for individuals and businesses to transact with one another across borders, facilitating greater economic cooperation and growth worldwide.</p><p>Overall, a unit of account not impacted by inflation would offer a stable foundation for the global economy, enabling businesses and individuals to plan for the future more confidently while promoting more responsible economic decision-making and international trade.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk3NDc5MzA0MTc3NjU2ODM4/unit-of-account-feature-image-with-text.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NDc5NTQ0Njk1ODI1NDE0/scales.png" height="349" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NDc5MDIyMzIwNDI4MDM4/unnamed.png" height="366" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[What is a Store of Value?

This term is used to describe a mechanism that enables individuals to preserve their wealth without experiencing any loss in value over time. </p><p>It is one of the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-money">three functions of <em>money</em></a><em> </em>that Bitcoin Magazine is exploring; the other two are <em><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/medium-of-exchange">medium of exchange</a></em> and <em><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/unit-of-account">unit of account</a><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-money/unit-of-account"></a></em>.</p><h2>What is a Store of Value</h2><p>A store of value is an asset, a currency or a commodity that can be trusted to hold its value over time; ideally, it doesn’t bear much risk. Traditionally, people who are less tolerant to risk will invest in a store of value with an enduring lifespan, a stable demand and low volatility. </p><p>Fiat currencies are weak stores of value since they depreciate over time due to inflation. Commodities like bitcoin, gold and a collection of other monetary metals have good store-of-value attributes because they are relatively limited in supply and do not deteriorate over time, thereby maintaining their value.</p><p>Salability is the critical property that allows something to be freely used as money and defines a physical good or asset that can be quickly sold. To have salability, money must be divisible (scale dimension), transportable (space dimension) and durable (time dimension). When an asset possesses salability across time, we have a good store of value because it can be trusted to maintain its value into the future.</p><p>One benchmark often used to understand the store-of-value function is that the value of an ounce of gold happened to match the price of a high-quality men’s suit. This principle is known as the “gold-to-decent-suit ratio,” and its roots can be traced back to Ancient Rome, where the cost of a top-of-the-line toga was said to be equivalent to an ounce of gold. After 2,000 years, the price — defined in gold — of a high-quality suit is still close to the price of an equivalent Ancient Roman toga.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Another example is the price of one barrel of oil in fiat versus gold. In 1913, <a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&amp;s=rwtc&amp;f=m">one barrel of oil cost $0.97</a>, while <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/energy">today it’s about $80</a>. In contrast, <a href="https://onlygold.com/gold-prices/historical-gold-prices/">one ounce of gold would buy 22 barrels of oil in 1913</a>, while it buys roughly 24 today — showing barely any difference in the gold price (good store of value) versus a big depreciation of the fiat currency (bad store of value).</p><h2>Why do we need a store of value?</h2><p>Money is an essential tool for trading goods and services, but it is also important to have a good store of value to save and secure a better future for ourselves and our families. While fiat currencies are suitable as a medium of exchange, they are not reliable stores of value, as they lose value over time due to inflation, historically around 2-3% per year.</p><p>In extreme cases, such as in Venezuela, South Sudan and Zimbabwe, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-hyperinflation">hyperinflation</a> has led to astronomical rates of inflation, making these fiat currencies very poor stores of value. While these examples serve as outliers, rising inflation levels are becoming more common in modern times, leading to a natural mechanism to save for the future and to find ways to beat 2-3% inflation rates.</p><p>It’s important to have a reliable store of value to secure the value of our hard-earned money over time. As poor stores of value, fiat currencies are thought to discourage people from saving or even earning money in the first place. </p><h2>Is money a good store of value?</h2><p>In the modern age, we use “fiat” currencies,, the term derived from the Latin word “fiat” meaning a decree or an arbitrary order; it’s basically a promise of what a value could be. Such a concept was established when governments’ paper or minted money could be redeemed for a set amount of a physical commodity. Since then, the term fiat has remained, even though currencies aren’t backed by commodities or possess any intrinsic value of their own. </p><p>While fiat currency has many properties that identify it as money, it’s a poor store of value since it isn’t linked to physical reserves, such as gold or silver. The result is that fiat currencies gradually lose value due to inflation or suddenly in the event of hyperinflation. </p><p>Fiat currencies are considered soft money because they are too dependent on a government’s price stability targets — generally focused on price stability, with general prices increasing at 2% per year — instead of allowing the market to naturally decide prices. This approach leads governments to gradually siphon off the value of the money while increasing the price of everything else in the process.</p><h2>Essential Elements of a Store of Value</h2><p><br>During its evolution as money, an item will develop through three different phases, starting with a <em>store of value</em> before becoming a <em><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/medium-of-exchange">medium of exchange</a></em> and eventually a <em><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/unit-of-account">unit of account</a><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-money/unit-of-account"></a></em><em>. </em>The three dimensions of the most salable goods are across time, space and through scales.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NDc5MDIyMzIwNDI4MDM4/unnamed.png" height="366" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>A store of value is the most salable good, one that has the ability to preserve its value over time.</p><p>To possess the function of a store of value, a salable good should be scarce; it must have a limited supply compared to other goods. It should also be durable so that it can be used repeatedly without losing its functionality. </p><ul><li>Scarcity: a good that’s limited in supply relative to other goods and to the demand for it. Computer scientist <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/nick-szabo">Nick Szabo</a> defined scarcity as “unforgeable costliness,” meaning the cost of creating something cannot be faked. If money is too plentiful, it loses value over time as more units can and will be created, and more will be required to purchase a good or service.</li></ul><ul><li>Durability: this property refers to the ability of a good to maintain its physical and functional properties over time. This means that the currency should be able to withstand wear and tear and remain in circulation for a long period without deteriorating or losing its value.</li></ul><ul><li>Immutability: Immutability is a desirable and new property of money because it ensures that once a transaction is confirmed and recorded, it cannot be altered or reversed. </li></ul><h2>What's a good store of value?</h2><p>Many different assets can serve as a store of value, but defining the best is constantly debated among investors and largely depends on market dynamics and investors’ preferences. It is worth noting that certain assets may lose their store-of-value status over time. A prime example of this is silver, which experienced a decrease in its store-of-value functionality as its supply increased due to its growing use in industrial applications rather than its traditional use as a monetary metal.</p><h3>Bitcoin</h3><p>Initially regarded as a speculative asset due to its notable price fluctuations, bitcoin increasingly became a store of value as investors and more people realized its potential worth as a new monetary asset. Bitcoin represents the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-discovery-of-bitcoin-is-a-puzzle">discovery of digital, sound money</a> and is a scientific revolution that is proving so far to not only be a store of value but also a means to increase value. </p><p>Bitcoin is becoming a significant force in the economy because it meets the requirements of a store of value better than any other form of money.</p><ul><li>Scarcity: Bitcoin has a finite supply of 21 million coins, which makes it resistant to the arbitrary inflation that ails traditional currencies. This limited supply gives it a scarcity value, making it a valuable asset to hold and store wealth.</li></ul><ul><li>Durability: Bitcoin is a purely data-based, immutable form of money. Its digital ledger system uses proof of work and economic incentives to resist any attempts to alter it, ensuring that it remains a reliable store of value over time.</li></ul><ul><li>Immutability: once a transaction is confirmed and recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be altered or reversed. This immutability is a critical feature of Bitcoin because it ensures that the integrity of the ledger is maintained, and transactions cannot be tampered with or falsified. This is especially important in an increasingly digital world, where trust and security are paramount concerns.</li></ul><h3>Precious Metals</h3><p>Precious metals like gold, palladium and platinum have long been good stores of value due to their perpetual shelf life and industrial use cases. They are relatively limited in supply which makes their value appreciate relative to fiat money. Bitcoin is even more limited in supply than gold and precious metals and has <a href="https://charts.woobull.com/bitcoin-vs-gold/">appreciated in value against gold</a> since its inception.</p><p>Physically storing large quantities of gold is expensive and challenging. For this reason, investors often choose to invest in digital gold or gold stocks, which are subject to counterparty risks. Gemstones like diamonds and sapphires are useful too as they are easier to store and transport.</p><h3>Real Estate</h3><p>Real estate is one of the most common stores of value due to its tangibility and utility. Over time, its value tends to increase, at least this has been the case since the 1970s. Before then, real estate and land kept pace with prices, having real returns around ~0% over longer periods (subject to wars and crashes, etc). Despite temporary downfalls along the way, it remains stable, offering physical land or construction owners a sense of safety when investing in it.</p><p>Real estate can be any physical property like land or a home that can be used as a primary residence, a vacation home, or a commercial property to rent or sell. The downside of real estate is that it’s not liquid or censorship resistant. This lack of liquidity can be problematic for property owners who require access to cash quickly and can be subject to government intervention or legal action. </p><h3>Stock Market</h3><p>Buying stocks on the NYSE, the LSE and the JPX markets has proved to be a good investment over time because they have increased their worth over the years: Stocks have been decent stores of value. However, they may experience high volatility and depend highly on market forces and economic movements, which makes them similar to fiat currencies.</p><h3>Index Funds/ETFs</h3><p>Index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are another way to get exposure to the stock and equity markets and provide an easy way for investors to diversify their portfolios. </p><p>Over a long time, such markets have also proved to increase in value, making them good stores of value. ETFs are also more cost- and tax-efficient than similar mutual funds. </p><h3>Other stores of value</h3><p>People can get creative with their favorite stores of value that sometimes match their passions or interests. For example, fine wines, classic cars, watches or art can be good stores of value as their worth typically appreciates over time.</p><h2>What’s a bad store of value</h2><h3>Perishable items</h3><p>Perishable items are goods that expire and lose value over time, gradually becoming worthless. </p><p>Food makes for a poor store of value, as it has an expiry date. A ticket to a concert or for transport becomes worthless after the expiry date, and are also considered perishable.</p><p>Therefore, they are not considered a good store of value.</p><h3>Fiat money</h3><p>We mentioned that fiat currencies do not retain their value over time, as the chart below shows.</p><p>It is mainly due to inflation that they lose value because every year, the price of goods and services tends to rise compared to the dollar and other fiat currencies. As a result, currencies consistently lose purchasing power.</p><figure>

    </figure><h3>Cryptocurrency</h3><p>Cryptocurrency alternatives to bitcoin are very similar to speculative stocks, with even higher risks since most have short lifespans and almost all lose value versus bitcoin over the long term. </p><p>Cryptocurrencies with longer lifespans prioritize functionality over security, scarcity and censorship resistance, making them poor stores of value, considering their poor economic propositions and weak use cases.</p><p>According to research conducted by <a href="https://twitter.com/alphaazeta/status/1641534991556288532">Swan Bitcoin</a>, altcoins have proven to be a bad investment. The study analyzed 8,000 cryptocurrencies since 2016 and found that 2,635 of them had underperformed versus Bitcoin and a staggering 5,175 of the cryptocurrencies no longer exist.</p><figure>

    </figure><h3>Speculative Stocks</h3><p>Speculative stocks are small-cap assets, also called penny stocks, that trade at less than $5 per share. They are not considered good stores of value because they are highly speculative. </p><p>Due to their high volatility and low market caps, they can quickly and suddenly increase a lot or lose all of their value. They are considered risky investments and certainly do not make good stores of value. </p><h3>Government bonds?</h3><p>For a long time, government bonds like U.S. treasuries were considered great stores of value simply because governments backed them. However, negative interest rates applied for years have highly affected the economies of big countries like Japan, Germany and other European countries, making government bonds unattractive for the average investor. Some bonds are meant to protect beneficiaries from inflation such as I-bonds and TIPS. However, they are still government-led and rely on the Bureau of Labor Statistics to accurately calculate the inflation rate (which it may choose, or be influenced, not to do).</p><h2>The bottom line</h2><p>​​To sum up, a store of value tends to maintain or increase its purchasing power over time, depending on the law of supply and demand, which can also be used to determine whether or not something might be a good store of value. </p><p>Many still regard bitcoin as an experiment. However, its relatively short life has proved that it offers all those properties typical of money and is a good store of value. The next challenge will be to prove that it can also be a unit of account.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk3NDc5MTM4Mjg0NTQ1OTQ3/store-of-value-feature-image-with-text.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NDc5MTk3ODc3MjE2MjYy/gold-to-decent-suit-ratio.png" height="349" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NDc5MDIyMzIwNDI4MDM4/unnamed.png" height="366" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NDc5MjM4OTQ3ODQxOTQ3/unnamed-2.png" height="337" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NDc5MjUwNDkwNTY1NjM4/unnamed-3.png" height="425" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[What is a Medium of Exchange?

Barter is not suitable as a means to exchange goods and services in an economic system larger than a tribe or family; barter was unsuitable for expanding societies that needed a more efficient method to exchange goods and services. </p><p>Hence, about 2,600 years ago, a new and more sophisticated medium of exchange emerged in Lydia — a region recognized as modern Turkey — and materialized with stamped coins to face the challenges of barter and facilitate trade.</p><p>A medium of exchange is an intermediary item that is widely accepted to facilitate the trade of goods and services between two parties. It is one of money’s three universally agreed functions, along with store of value and unit of account. A <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/store-of-value">store of value</a> is any asset that maintains its value over time without depreciating. A <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/unit-of-account">unit of account</a> is a standard monetary unit that measures the market value of goods, services, economic activities, assets and liabilities. </p><p>Bitcoin Magazine takes you through the significance of money and its different spectrums. After exploring <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-money">what money is</a> and what underlines its value, we now dive into its primary functions, starting with the medium of exchange.</p><h2>What is a Medium of Exchange</h2><p>A medium of exchange is an intermediary instrument that facilitates the buying and selling of goods or services. In remote times, shells, whale teeth, salt, tobacco and other objects that occurred rarely in nature were employed. Nowadays, currencies are the most common media of exchange as they’re suitable intermediaries between the products or services people want to trade. Still, currency needs to possess specific properties.</p><p>The first medium of exchange coin was created by the Lydians, who hailed from Anatolia in modern-day Turkey. The coin was made of a gold and silver alloy to certify weight and purity and was stamped with images of merchants, landowners or other well-known entities.</p><p>While gold and other metals had likely already been used as a medium of exchange, the Lydians first issued official standardized coins that could be accepted as an intermediary good with a set value recognized as money. They thereby economized on the assaying of the unstamped coins, cutting out some transaction costs in dealing with monetary metals.</p><p>In our modern economies, governments must ensure that their currencies are made widely available to the public, that they are not easy to counterfeit and that they are available in sufficient quantities to satisfy public demand.</p><h2>Why Is a Medium of Exchange Needed?</h2><p>A medium of exchange allows us to trade more efficiently by solving the barter problem, often referred to as the coincidence of wants — a term used to describe an instance where I have the item that you want and you have the item that I want. The mental burden of having to find this exact scenario over and over again in order to trade is considerable, and an impediment to a growing economy. </p><p>Imagine I have a battery and want to trade it for some medicine. I would have to find someone with medicine who is in need of a battery and then negotiate a trade, which can be a complicated endeavor. A medium of exchange makes trade more accessible by allowing people to trade goods indirectly for other good</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NDc5MDAyOTkzMDc2MTIz/unnamed-1.png" height="349" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>As the primary purpose of a medium of exchange is to facilitate transactions between parties, to be effective a medium of exchange must be recognized and accepted by all parties. Here, the concept of a medium of exchange converges with the purpose of a good store of value since its stability allows owners to store it for an extended period with relatively low risks as an investment.</p><h2>Money As a Medium of Exchange</h2><p>Money serves as the most efficient medium of exchange that eliminates the issue of the coincidence of wants commonly associated with barter, allowing individuals, companies and systems to transact with ease.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NDc4OTc2MTQ5NTMwNTIz/medium-of-exchange.png" height="692" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>As an intermediary tool, money enables buyers and sellers to participate in the market as equal players, leading to fair trade and increased production efficiency. This is because money helps producers to identify what goods or services to produce and the optimal pricing model for them. Likewise, buyers can plan their purchases based on predictable and stable pricing models.</p><p>When purchasing a product or service, buyers typically bid according to the asking price, which in turn allows producers to determine the variety and quantity of items to be produced. However, if consumers are unable to accurately value a product or service, it can lead to difficulties in budget planning, potentially resulting in a chaotic economy due to the challenges of estimating demand and supply.</p><h2>Essential Elements of a Medium of Exchange</h2><p>An item or system must possess certain properties that facilitate efficiency and functionality to be a suitable medium of exchange. It’s not necessary for an item to be backed by a commodity or any other asset to become money. Instead, it must evolve to become the most salable good following an evolutionary process that starts with being recognized as a store of value before being a medium of exchange and eventually becoming a unit of account.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NDc5MDIyMzIwNDI4MDM4/unnamed.png" height="366" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>The three dimensions of the most salable goods are across time, space and through scales.</p><p>To possess the function of a medium of exchange, a salable good should be easily transported and accepted over long distances, and be used in indirect exchange for trade rather than for direct consumption.</p><p>Such a function can be achieved through two key properties: wide acceptability by the public and portability, which makes it easy to move over large distances.</p><h2>What Makes a Good Medium of Exchange</h2><p>The aforementioned properties make any item or system a good medium of exchange. Also, a good medium of exchange should hold value over time and be censorship resistant other than serving its purpose as an intermediary for exchanging goods or services between two parties.</p><p>In the case of currencies serving the purpose of money, they are only as good as the governments that issue them. Political instability, rampant inflation and government malfunction inevitably affect the value and stability of a nation’s currency.</p><h2>Digital Evolution</h2><p>The digital era has brought new opportunities to develop an innovative monetary system based on protected cryptography and distributed networks that ensure decentralization. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/industry-events/nick-szabo-on-bitcoin-2021">Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency</a> that can be regarded as a good medium of exchange, possessing all the essential criteria that make trade transactions easy, fast and secure. It’s already proved to be a good store of value and, since it owns the properties necessary to be a good medium of exchange, it also has the potential to become a unit of account.</p><p>One key advantage of bitcoin as a medium of exchange is its ability to settle transactions quickly. Bitcoin transactions are confirmed and settled every 10 minutes on the blockchain, making them faster than traditional banking methods, which can take days or even weeks to complete. This speed is especially important for businesses that require fast and efficient payment processing.</p><p>Another important feature of bitcoin as a medium of exchange is the efficiency of its Layer 2 solutions, such as the Lightning Network. The Lightning Network is a second-layer solution built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain that enables instant and low-cost transactions between parties. With the Lightning Network, market participants can conduct microtransactions without having to wait for confirmations on the blockchain, making it a highly efficient solution for small transactions.</p><p>It also provides extra properties like censorship resistance to better protect the people who live under authoritarian governments, and absolute scarcity, since its total supply moves closer to the maximum 21-million amount with every new block mined. Bitcoin’s revolutionary system may disrupt the status quo and its limitations, but it’s still in the infancy stage and like anything so innovative, it will take time to catch on.</p><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Society has evolved throughout the centuries, as have its monetary systems, which have adapted to its expanding size and economy. Despite the complexity of global commerce being made more efficient by the internet, many challenges, like online security and privacy, still need to be overcome. While these challenges are unique to the modern era, evolution is inherently part of the nature of trade. </p><p>The methods and means of trade are in a perpetual state of change and development, keeping up with technological advancements and the evolving needs of society. Despite these changes, the properties that underpin trade remain constant. As the trading landscape transforms, the fundamental properties of wide acceptability, portability, value preservation and, more recently, censorship resistance are required for a tool to function well as a medium of exchange, and they have remained unchanged over time. </p><p>Therefore, as trade continues to evolve, the importance of these underlying properties will continue to be crucial in determining the success and stability of any economy. The good that best satisfies these properties should emerge as the dominant medium of exchange, but this evolution can take time.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk3NDc5MDYzOTI3OTI0NjM1/medium-of-exchange-feature-image-with-text.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NDc5MDAyOTkzMDc2MTIz/unnamed-1.png" height="349" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NDc4OTc2MTQ5NTMwNTIz/medium-of-exchange.png" height="692" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NDc5MDIyMzIwNDI4MDM4/unnamed.png" height="366" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[A Seized Bitcoin Stack Could Be Bulgaria's Golden Ticket]]></title><description><![CDATA[After seizing 213,000 bitcoin in 2017, Bulgaria now has an opportunity to become one of the wealthiest countries on earth.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-future-for-bulgaria-seized-bitcoin</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-future-for-bulgaria-seized-bitcoin</guid><category><![CDATA[government seizure]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[u.s. dollar]]></category><category><![CDATA[bitcoin price]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Ahmed Botan]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 24 Apr 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MjMxNzYxODMwNTUzMDkz/bitcoin-stack.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Ahmed Botan, a marketing professional with a focus on Bitcoin-based projects.</em></p><p>Bulgaria, a small country located in Southeast Europe, nestled between Romania and Greece, is set to become one of the wealthiest countries in the world. </p><p>The reason for this is its possession of 213,000 bitcoin, which its authorities seized from a group they labeled as criminals in 2017. According to the <a href="https://www.coininsider.com/bulgarian-government-owns-3-billion-usd-bitcoin/">South East European Law Enforcement Center</a> (SELC), the group hacked the Bulgarian customs agency’s computers and made changes to the system so that their partner companies could import goods while avoiding paying taxes on them.</p><p>Immediately following the crackdown, the bitcoin seized was worth about $500,000, however, it would now be worth closer to $6 billion dollars, as of April 2023. While the <a href="https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=02b41baf-5f0d-4696-a580-5aba28b2a8ca">details around the BTC seizure are unclear</a>, and it is not totally clear whether the country still holds that bitcoin or what it plans to do with the stack if it does, the potential of a nation like Bulgaria holding this much BTC is worth exploring.</p><p>As the value of bitcoin is, in the view of many, set to go up a lot higher still in the coming years, Bulgaria could stand to become very wealthy.</p><h2>The Rising Price Of Bulgaria’s Bitcoin</h2><p>While the future price of bitcoin is impossible to predict, there are some prominent examples of experts explaining why they are confident Bulgaria’s bitcoin holdings will grow exponentially in value. </p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Croesus_BTC">Jesse Meyers</a>, the COO of Onramp Bitcoin who holds an MBA from Stanford University, <a href="https://jessemyers.substack.com/p/bitcoins-full-potential-valuation">has predicted that the bitcoin price will hit $10 million in the coming decades.</a> Ark Invest CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/CathieDWood?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Cathie Wood</a> has predicted <a href="https://milkroad.com/predictions">bitcoin will reach $1 million by 2030</a> in a bullish scenario. Similarly, <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoHayes">Arthur Hayes</a>, co-founder of BitMex <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/arthur-hayes-thinks-bitcoin-can-still-hit-1m-this-cycle/">believes that bitcoin could hit $1 million by 2026</a>.</p><p>Most recently, the former CTO of Coinbase, <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis">Balji Srinivasan</a>, has predicted that <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/former-coinbase-cto-makes-2m-bet-on-bitcoin-s-performance">bitcoin would hit $1 million by June 15, 2023</a>, wagering $2 million to that effect.</p><p>While most people don't believe that the bitcoin price can reach $1 million by then, anything is possible. For example, if there was an extended banking crisis and hyperinflation of the U.S. dollar, as predicted by Srinivasan, who knows how valuable Bulgaria’s bitcoin stack will become?</p><p>For instance, shortly after Srinivasan’s bet (although this was certainly unrelated), several nations, including China, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kenya and more <a href="https://www.newsafrica.net/article/is-it-time-for-africa-to-ditch-the-us-dollar-in-international-trade-deals">began moving away from using the U.S. dollar in their trades</a>, With the Kenyan president warning citizens to <a href="https://winepressnews.com/2023/03/28/kenya-president-tells-citizens-to-get-rid-of-holdings-of-us-dollar-as-nations-dump-the-dollar-and-begin-to-embrace-petroyuan/">get rid of their dollar holdings</a>.</p><p>The United States government has measures in place to prevent further bank runs, like the Federal Reserve's <a href="https://news.research.stlouisfed.org/2023/03/fred-adds-bank-term-funding-program-data/#:~:text=This%20program%20was%20launched%20on,in%20connection%20to%20this%20program.">$25 billion bank-term funding program</a> (BTFP) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC’s) openness to cover all deposits.</p><p>I think, if the FDIC decides to insure all deposits, that will be enough to deter true bank runs, but it’s clear that the U.S. dollar is not as strong as it used to be. And that opens the door for a decentralized, global monetary unit like bitcoin to rise.</p><p>As a result, if Bulgaria holds onto its BTC stash, it could amass more value relative to the holdings of other countries around the world and become one of the world’s richest.</p><h2>So, What Will Bulgaria Do With Its Bitcoin?</h2><p>Bulgaria could use future bitcoin gains to invest in its economy, but it will have to pay off national debts first. As of 2022, Bulgaria’s <a href="https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/bulgaria/national-government-debt">national government debt reached $20 billion</a> in 2022.</p><p>By 2030, if the bitcoin price hits $1 million and it still holds its seized, 213,000 BTC stash, its holdings could be worth $213 billion.</p><p>After paying off its debt, Bulgaria could use the funds generated from selling the 231,000 BTC to invest in various industries, such as technology or real estate. Moreover, the Bulgarian government could use the funds generated from the sale of its bitcoin to improve the country's infrastructure, education and healthcare. By investing in these essential sectors, Bulgaria could attract foreign investment, and this would further boost the country's economy.</p><p>Bulgaria has a significant opportunity to become one of the wealthiest countries in the world if it HODLs its bitcoin and sells some at the right time. But it seems wise for the country to keep a significant portion of bitcoin in reserve in perpetuity, as fiat currencies like the dollar continue to deteriorate.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Ahmed Botan.

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Source Node, a former sales account manager with a background in training and industrial-organizational psychology.</em></p><p>When I pitch Bitcoin to a relative, to a friend or to a complete stranger in the bathroom stall next to me, they will inevitably ask, "How is this benefiting you? Are you going to make money from me buying bitcoin?" </p><p>In one sense, the honest answer is yes, but my main objective is actually to <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Eightfold-Path">alleviate suffering</a>. </p><p>Will any single investor buying bitcoin make my bitcoin increase in value? Not unless I'm convincing a hyper-rich <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-america-should-ban-crypto-regulation-economy-finance-china-england-trading-currency-securities-commodity-gamble-11675287477?mod=article_inline">communist sympathizer</a> like Charlie Munger to hop onboard. The average investor buying $1,000-worth of BTC is not going to change the price of bitcoin. In fact, even a very wealthy investor allocating $100 million may not significantly change the price of bitcoin. In that sense, I am not benefiting directly from convincing individuals to buy bitcoin at all.</p><p>However, given the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/an-objective-look-at-bitcoin-adoption">early stage</a> of adoption that we are currently experiencing, the asymmetric upside of investing in bitcoin today has the potential to turn a relatively-small investment into life-changing financial security. For this reason, the motivation to pitch Bitcoin to people I care about is greater now than it will be in the future. The potential future which Bitcoin enables for myself and for society is the primary driving force behind my participation in the network. The prospect of living in a world of abundance, voluntary behavior and geopolitical cooperation is becoming more achievable by the block. I wish to benefit from the transition to that world and I wish for those whom I love (as well as random strangers I encounter) to benefit from it as well. </p><p>I know I am not the only one who holds this view. It seems to be a natural inclination for nearly every Bitcoiner to compulsively <a href="https://ibb.co/HtjG941">pitch</a> Bitcoin to their friends, relatives and acquaintances. Unfortunately, I have seen many people become exhausted with these pitches. This exhaustion seems to slow down adoption more than support it, which indicates to me that some of what I have to share regarding sales may be helpful.</p><p>Every Bitcoiner who crosses the threshold into this <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-as-a-human-resources-department">decentralized organization</a> brings with them a unique profile of knowledge, skills and interests. I have always had a passion for the discipline of sales. But as a third-generation salesman on my father’s side, I am frequently disgraced by the state of the trade. The word “salesman” often conjures up visions of a pushy vacuum peddler on your doorstep, a slippery used car dealer or an overpaid executive who is better at golf than he is at demonstrating the product that his company manufactures. This is not the vision I have of sales as a vocation or as an art.</p><p>Illustrated broadly, everyone is engaged in sales. Most sales people know this. There is nothing invasive about representing oneself in a conscious manner, sharing a vision and educating in a way that caters to individual differences. Sales is about influencing the perspectives of others to motivate behavioral change. Nowhere in that process does a salesperson have to sacrifice honesty, integrity or reputation.</p><p>Throughout this article, I will refer to anyone we might be pitching Bitcoin to as a “customer.” This isn’t meant to be cold and impersonal, but rather an illustrative metaphor. There are tools which can assist us in developing an effective approach to discussing Bitcoin with <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/why-bitcoin-needs-a-marketing-department">prospective customers</a>. </p><p>The following information is a summary of what I have found to be effective in pitching Bitcoin and my best attempt at describing the attitudes which have supported the greatest success stories. </p><h2>The Outer Strategy</h2><p>The Bitcoin sales cycle is long. Bitcoin isn’t just sold once, it’s sold continuously every moment that a person chooses to hold it. Bitcoin is conceptualized and utilized differently by each participant in the network based on their unique needs and lifestyle choices. Due to the longevity and complexity of a proper Bitcoin pitch, I have found that “<a href="https://challengerinc.com/the-challenger-books/">The Challenger Sale</a>” model is especially well suited for selling Bitcoin.</p><p>“The Challenger Sale” by Matthew Dixon and Brent Adamson outlines research on sales performance across many industries and outlines <a href="https://www.impactplus.com/blog/the-5-types-of-sellers-of-the-challenger-sale">five basic types</a> of salespeople. The salespeople who consistently outperformed their counterparts, during strong as well as weak economic conditions, fell under the category that the book is named after. These sales people had certain traits in common and in my observation, many Bitcoiners exemplify these traits as well. I will touch on the research findings briefly, but if you want a deeper dive into nuances of the topic, I would recommend picking up a copy of the book.</p><p>“Challengers,” as they are differentiated from their counterparts, frequently hold a unique <a href="https://www.hope.com/">view of the world</a>, they love to debate, they are not afraid to <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/op-ed-why-bitcoins-toxic-maximalism-makes-sense">push</a> the customer and they have a deep understanding of the customer’s business. From my interactions with Bitcoiners over the years, I see these qualities very frequently. Challengers also tend to find themselves in teaching roles, which is reflected through the many books and podcasts created as Bitcoin educational tools. </p><p>The challenger is well read on every aspect of the sale and can preempt arguments against their points of view. Achieving this degree of intellectual karate may lead you toward reading about economics, engineering, psychology, history, philosophy, spirituality, physics and ecology. In order to approach a topic holistically, one must understand the foundations, the arguments and the counterarguments. Be ready not just to agree or disagree, but to provide a detailed explanation of your reasoning if required. </p><p>Every person you interact with will have a different path to understanding Bitcoin. Certain key pieces of information will ignite a fire of interest in one person and have no effect on another. Learn to find these key areas of interest through practice and repetition. As a general tip, I have found that pitching Bitcoin to people close to my own age is more effective than trying to sell across generational gaps. Studying <a href="https://postimg.cc/rRLtZjdw">integral theory</a> is helpful with the process of understanding customer value systems as well.</p><p>There is a critical balance to be achieved regarding debate and pushing the customer. When you are pushing the customer, keep the conversation friendly. It is possible to chip away at someone’s defenses with humor and creativity rather than by annoying or humiliating them. Emotional intelligence is required to find the right balance between pushing, pulling and resting. </p><p>It’s important to be up front about bitcoin’s performance over the short term and the long term. It is your job to carefully gauge the customer's risk tolerance and conviction in the face of volatility. If you get the impression that someone is buying just because they trust what you are saying, tread carefully. Unless the person you are speaking with understands how to responsibly self custody and to avoid trading on leverage, you may want to dissuade them from buying in large amounts. If your customer bites off more than they can chew and gets burned, it will take them even longer to benefit from Bitcoin.</p><p>Customers who walk away from a conversation having learned something valuable are much more likely to pick up the phone and call that salesperson back. However, there is a difference between being a source of knowledge and being a firehouse of unsolicited opinions. Sometimes, the best way to start a teaching discussion is to ask some questions. Effective teaching is not a forceful process. It is your job to pique the interest of whoever you are speaking with so that they begin to request further information. Try to avoid going on <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=sperg%20out">extensive monologues</a> and maintain engagement from whoever you are speaking with.</p><p>Tailoring a pitch to a grocery store cashier or to a hedge-fund manager will be very different discussions. These approaches are unique for each individual, but there are two primary categories: One approach is bottom up (related to price inflation) and the other is top down (related to central banking and market forces). Both begin with a discussion around the dollar and how it functions. Most people will dismiss Bitcoin as pointless until they understand the problem it is solving. When discussing the <a href="https://saifedean.com/the-fiat-standard-chapter-1">fiat problem</a>, I have found that speaking rationally about poorly-aligned incentives is generally more effective than launching into a verbal summary of “The Creature From Jekyll Island.” </p><p>The corporate media has been fairly effective at turning the word “Bitcoin” into something scary. Most of the time, I don’t even say the word “Bitcoin” until I get a clear sign of engagement. Open-ended questions are an effective way to gauge the level of understanding you’re cooperating with. For example,“How much do you know about Bitcoin?” or, “If I provided you with infinite funds, describe how you would attack the Bitcoin network or stop people from using it.” Leave room for the customer to <a href="https://www.runn.io/blog/never-split-the-difference-summary">disagree with you</a> and take their disagreement as a positive step in the debate process.</p><p>The ability to transcend political discussions makes controlling the direction of the conversation much easier. Money supersedes politics and the discussion can always be returned to the banking system. I continuously maintain that whatever political issue may be irritating the customer, it will only get worse until the money is fixed. Any effort to fix a societal problem without fixing the money is like using a bucket to throw water out of a ship without addressing the hole causing the ship to sink. </p><p>Remember to be measured in your approach. You don’t have anything to prove to anyone. Don’t forget what is most important to you and don’t get caught up in the desire to be right or to prove someone else wrong. When you’re laying on your deathbed, you won’t be kicking yourself for failing to orange pill a relative at Thanksgiving, but you might regret burning a bridge with someone you love over an unnecessary argument.</p><h2>The Inner Game</h2><p>Book smarts and creative problem solving are important tools, but when it comes to sales, the most critical skill to develop is emotional attunement. An effective salesperson will accurately read the emotional tone of the conversation in real time and adjust their approach as needed. There are a number of skills involved in this form of emotional intelligence, the most important of which is learning to accurately read and interpret <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/non-verbal-communication">nonverbal communication</a>. </p><p>In my experience, the primary impediment to emotional attunement is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_New_Earth">egotistical dysfunction</a> on the part of the salesperson. The ego is critical to human functioning and is not to be vilified, but it should not be running the show either. The degree to which a salesperson can relate to a prospective customer is a question of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiSsxVM0B-U">spiritual development</a> more than business acumen. Nothing is more attractive or conducive to building trust than authenticity and honesty. In order to live with authenticity, we are required to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61315.The_Presence_Process">face discomfort</a> and integrate the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/179FNB8TC1KikVhii4kEgQ?si=2e625aa1d6e5405a">aspects of ourselves</a> that we reject. Without understanding your own intentions, you cannot understand the intentions of others. </p><p>Present yourself in the most transparent way possible. Deceitful action and hypocrisy are repulsive to the human spirit. The fiat system has a way of holding us hostage in situations which pressure us to compromise our values. As a result, we find ourselves alienated from our true intentions and separated from authentic relationships. Bitcoin enables us to liberate ourselves from these discouraging moral concessions, if we wish to do so.</p><p>Regardless of the behavior of those struggling to maintain a broken system, Bitcoiners can choose to persevere in equanimity. This temperament can only serve to vaporize phony criticisms of Bitcoin with the light of truth. Maintaining the higher ground will depend on a certain degree of personal and collective purification. Admit your faults and shortcomings without any reservation as soon as you perceive them. Striving to prove others wrong is a silly game which benefits no one. Striving to be effective in <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/how-to-argue-win-every-time-gerry-spence/1111811437">achieving your goals</a> is a worthwhile undertaking.</p><p>If you let your ego enter the Bitcoin sales pitch, you are more likely to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Four_Agreements">take criticisms personally</a> and the conversation will drift into alienation. If you approach the discussion honestly and <a href="https://www.cnvc.org/learn-nvc/what-is-nvc">compassionately</a>, you will create an ally rather than an enemy. I have often encountered a tremendous amount of resistance in conversations about Bitcoin and returned to that person months later to find that they have internalized much of what I said. </p><p>If the conversation remains respectful, you can walk away and let the orange marinade do its work. This is especially true as bank failures and inflation continue to draw attention to the issue at hand. Very few people are ready to change their minds in a single conversation. In fact, my recommendation would be to forego the intent to change anyone’s mind, but rather to provide information so that your acquaintance can reach their own conclusion. </p><p>When anger enters a discussion about Bitcoin, your customer will fail to see the countless hours of research you have applied to understanding the topic. If you get rattled by their questions or comments, they will only see fear, uncertainty and doubt. If you strike a condescending tone, you run the risk of pushing them away from Bitcoin rather than compelling them to learn more about it. If you feel animosity arising, take a step back and breathe.</p><p>Another common sales pitfall worth avoiding is “trash talking the competition.” It might be tempting to attack fiat currencies, stocks, bonds, altcoins or gold. Attacks like this exhibit weakness. Handling objections with grace develops confidence in the person you are speaking with. People are often very emotionally attached to their investments. Attacking them will cause the customer to double down and become much less open to hearing what you have to say. I do not denounce anyone for making certain investments, but I will gladly explain why bitcoin is likely to be superior in comparison to other assets.</p><blockquote><p>“It is only against the big waves that (a surfer) is required to use all his skill, all his courage and concentration to overcome; only then can he realize the true limits of his capacities. At that point he often slips into a superconscious state and attains his peak. In other words, the more challenging the obstacle he faces, the greater the opportunity for the surfer to discover and extend his true potential. The potential may have always been within him, but until it is manifested in action, it remains a secret hidden from himself. The obstacles are a very necessary ingredient to this process of self-discovery. Note that the surfer in this example is not out to prove himself; he is not out to show himself or the world how great he is, but is simply involved in the exploration of his latent capacities. He directly and intimately experiences his own resources and thereby increases his self-knowledge.”&nbsp;</p><p>–Timothy Gallwey, “<a href="https://mentoringgroup.com/books/the-inner-game-of-tennis.pdf">The Inner Game Of Tennis</a>”</p></blockquote><p>The above quote is no excuse for misleading unsuspecting financial refugees. Clown coins, vaporware and moral hazard should be dismissed resolutely. Those who support such misguided activities should be discredited mercilessly. However, all of this can be accomplished without losing your cool. Holding on to hate will not benefit you in any way. Always be ready for your detractors to <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2017:3-4&amp;version=NIV">switch to your side</a>. There is no need to make it harder for them to do so by treating them in a cruel manner. </p><p>I have found it helpful to frame all forms of “altcoin” investing as gambling behavior. In this way, I can view these choices through the lens of <a href="https://drgabormate.com/book/in-the-realm-of-hungry-ghosts/">addictive compulsion</a> rather than stupidity or some other judgmental interpretation. I do not enable addictive behavior by accepting excuses, but I do not criticize it either. The road out of addiction is often barricaded by trauma and maladaptive assumptions. Harsh judgment does not assist in dissolving these barriers, but rather reinforces the separation between the real world and the addict.</p><p>The only reason I am able to write this article is because I have broken every suggestion in it at one point or another and witnessed the results. I may continue to break these recommendations in the future, but I maintain a continuous practice of humility, compassion and patience. Self judgment stifles growth more than it fosters it. If you punish yourself for behaving differently than you would like, your actions will become contrivances; like a child who is constantly afraid of their <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/111209.Unconditional_Parenting">parent’s scorn</a>. This will likely counteract any efforts you apply toward living with more authenticity. </p><p>Acting out of a genuine desire to enhance life will help you to root into a more authentic lifestyle. That type of authenticity is magnetic. Look inward at your reservations and intentions. If you are trying to orange pill others to convince yourself of Bitcoin’s value or to prove yourself to the world, you will be better served by reserving your opinions until you no longer have these insecurities. If you are beyond the need for approval, your rate of success will increase dramatically. Act on the truth that you know.

    </figure><p>My husband and I decided to become Bitcoin educators because we passionately believe that Bitcoin is a money standard everyone should know about. However, it can be very discouraging sometimes when most people see us as religious, cult evangelists who they should avoid or only politely tolerate. </p><p>But then, out of the blue, I’ll experience amazing conversations with people who are ready to hear what we have to say. They are just waiting to find someone to discuss Bitcoin who can help them understand it better.</p><p>This article describes three such encounters I’ve had in unexpected places. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1339572-when-the-student-is-ready-the-teacher-will-appear-when">As the saying goes</a>, (slightly modified), “When the student is ready, the teacher (me) will be sent to them.”</p><h2>One: GoDaddy Tech Support</h2><p>A few months ago, when my husband Scott and I were just starting our financial-literacy- and Bitcoin-focused organization <a href="https://www.freemarketkids.com/">Free Market Kids</a>, we had a lot of trouble getting our website to work correctly. I spent hours with tech support through various service providers. During this incident, I called GoDaddy support and was instructed to reboot my computer. </p><p>While we were waiting for the computer to do its thing, instead of sitting on the line in silence, I began to chit chat with the support guy about where he was located, the weather, etc. Pretty soon, we were asking each other about our work and life experiences. </p><p>He asked, “So, what is Free Market Kids?” </p><p>“Well, we teach people about Bitcoin and money with our board games,” I answered.</p><p>“Bitcoin!” Sighing deeply, he continued, “I sold mine years ago.” </p><p>He explained that, early on, he had been persuaded by his friend to mine Bitcoin. When the price went up, he got excited and sold all his bitcoin because he needed the cash for something. </p><p>“And now,” he lamented, “I’m watching the bitcoin price go up like crazy, and I can’t believe I blew my chance!”</p><p>I asked him what he knew about Bitcoin, aside from what his friend told him to do. </p><p>“Very little,” he replied. </p><p>So, I explained the fundamental properties of Bitcoin to him and pointed out that he could always get back in. Thirty minutes later, long after my computer had rebooted and the original issue was resolved, we finally ended the call.</p><p>I was so excited about the conversation I went to tell my husband about it. </p><p>“I thought you were on GoDaddy support?” Scott asked.</p><p>“I was!” I responded excitedly.</p><p><em>When the student is ready, the teacher will be sent to them!</em></p><h2>Two: The Veterinary Office</h2><p>In preparation for some conferences we were attending, I designed a company t-shirt. Unfortunately, the first batch didn’t turn out well, so I decided to wear it around the house. Remembering a veterinarian appointment at the last minute, I rushed out with our dog, forgetting that I was sporting our company shirt.</p><p>After getting checked in and ushered to a tiny exam room, I sat down to wait with my elderly standard poodle, Ava, panting by my side. Moments later, the door opened, and the vet tech walked in, clipboard in hand. He looked at me without saying anything and squinted his eyes. </p><p>“Uh, do I have something on my face?” I thought, feeling a bit uncomfortable.</p><p>Then he broke the awkward silence and said, “Bitcoin, huh?”</p><p>“Yes?” I answered tentatively, looking down at my shirt.</p><p>“I have some questions for you!” he boomed. “Someone told me that bitcoin will go to zero. What do you think?” </p><p>“Uh, right… What do you know about Bitcoin in general?” I responded.</p><p>“Not much,” he admitted.</p><p>We chatted about Bitcoin, and he had endless questions. I watched the pen in his hand hover over Ava’s chart, but we didn’t talk about that patient, panting dog for a long time.</p><p>The vet visit that was supposed to take 20 minutes ended up taking an hour and a half.</p><p><em>When the student is ready, the teacher will be sent to them!</em></p><h2>Three: The Jewelry Store</h2><p>I went to a jewelry store to replace a broken necklace. Once again, I was wearing our company shirt and running errands. Two ladies stood behind the counter. While one was packing up my purchase, the other eyed me intently, leaned toward me, and whispered, “My brother is into cryptocurrency, but I don’t understand it. I know the economy is going to sh*t, but I don’t have a million dollars to invest in bitcoin.” </p><p>She continued, her eyes filled with tears, “I’m a single mom, and I’m scared of what’s going to happen.” </p><p>She looked tired, discouraged and very concerned.</p><p>“You don’t need a million dollars to invest in bitcoin,” I answered. “You can start with very small amounts, $1 or $5.” </p><p>We chatted for a long time, and I hugged her before we said goodbye. </p><p>“There’s a reason we met today,” I told her. “Reach out to me any time!”</p><p><em>When the student is ready, the teacher will be sent to them!</em></p><p>And, oh, maybe I should wear our company shirt more often!</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Tali Lindberg.
