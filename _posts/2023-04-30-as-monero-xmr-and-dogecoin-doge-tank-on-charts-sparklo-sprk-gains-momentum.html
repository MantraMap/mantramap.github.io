<p class="s6">A savvy Crypto investor knows when to buy, sell or hold their coins. More importantly, know vitality&mdash;when to buy and what to avoid. Some old guards like Monero (XMR) and Dogecoin (DOGE) have made investors have a run for their money&mdash;making them keep burning their fingers. </p>
<p class="s6">It has made investors want to diversify their portfolio with presale gems with potential growth of up to 4,000%. With newcomer Sparklo predicted to have a bright future in a highly volatile market, investors are waiting in anticipation of its launch.</p>
<p class="s6">What is it that makes a presale gem like Sparklo have so much promise?</p>
<p class="s3">Dogecoin (DOGE) Experiences the Highest Volatility</p>
<p class="s6">Even with great social media influences, Dogecoin (DOGE) has consistently plummeted, with a new all-time high of 14%&mdash;this was after Platformer reported that Twitter stopped the development of a crypto wallet. Looking at where it is now, from its all-time high price, it&rsquo;s no doubt that DOGE has crashed on the market by about 92%.</p>
<p class="s6">Dogecoin (DOGE) was at its peak when its breakout coincided with Elon Musk&rsquo;s Twitter deal. The acquisition deal was a positive development for the coin. Elon has suggested integrating Dogecoin (DOGE) to become a meme coin.</p>
<p class="s6">It sounds great, but it's still in theoretical development. Some experts believe that having a future Crypto Twitter is not a bad idea. After Elon acquired Twitter, Dogecoin (DOGE) prices went up for a while. But, due to a Platformer report, Dogecoin (DOGE) is among the worst performers on the Crypto Charts.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY SPARKLO TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s6">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s3">Price Predictions Don't Show Confidence for Monero (XMR)</p>
<p class="s6">Monero (XMR) provides privacy-centric proof of work functionality to ensure that transactions for users are private and non-traceable. Initially, it attracted investors who wanted 100% privacy when transacting. Far from that, it had many exciting use cases.</p>
<p class="s6">Lately, that doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the case, as price prediction shows XMR on a downward spiral, just after the launch of Monero (XMR), which saw its peak at $542.33 hovered to less than 10% of its peak. When you look at its bullish runs in 2021, you'll notice that Monero (XMR) failed to hit its all-time peak and was trading below $480.</p>
<p class="s6">There's no confidence as far as bull runs are concerned in the future. It's unlikely Monero (XMR) will recover any time soon. Therefore, traders are advised to look for alternative coins with a brighter future.</p>
<p class="s3">Sparklo (SPRK) Expected to Shoot to the Moons</p>
<p class="s6">As an alternative investment plan, Sparklo will give traders the best opportunity to trade and invest in fractionalized NFTs backed by Gold, Silver and Platinum&mdash;meaning that investors will have a fair chance of investing in NFTs representing real luxury assets.</p>
<p class="s6">More and more investors are waiting in anticipation for its launch since it offers opportunities to invest in precious metals&mdash;less risky assets. It's predicted that Sparklo will have a 4000% increase in price after launch&mdash;a reason to start buying now to make maximum profits.</p>
<p class="s6">Moreover, with its growth potential, SPRK will end up becoming the blue-chip Crypto. It gives you the best chance to get a future blue-chip Cryptocurrency at extremely affordable prices. It'll partner with jewellery stores to help bring new products to the market, plus offer great discounts to investors.</p>
<p class="s6">Worried about safety? Sparklo has measures in place to ensure safety. For starters, it has passed the InterFi network audit and will lock in liquidity for 100 years. In addition to this,Know Your Customer Audit will take place soon enough.</p>
<p class="s6">With unstable coins like Monero (XMR) not showing signs of making bullish runs, investors should seek out presale gems that have growth potential. With a price of $0.015 that's steadily rising to $0.017 by the end of the week, Sparklo is a fire innovative investment alternative that investors should watch.</p>
