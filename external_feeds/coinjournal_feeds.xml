										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Laval, Canada, May 11th, 2023, Chainwire</strong></p>
<p>Groundbreaking Initiative Revolutionizes ASIC Repair Services, Encourages Sustainability and Decentralization in Cryptocurrency Mining.</p>
<p>D-Central Technologies Inc., a pioneer in the cryptocurrency mining industry, is excited to announce the expansion of its revolutionary &ldquo;Hash No Cash&rdquo; program to all cryptocurrency miners in North America. This innovative initiative, previously accessible only to select clients, is now available to miners of all scales, dramatically transforming the landscape of ASIC repair services.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Hash No Cash&rdquo; program allows D-Central to provide high-quality repair services for mining hardware at no cash cost, instead accepting broken hardware as payment. This innovative approach is a testament to D-Central&rsquo;s commitment to fostering sustainable, accessible, and cost-effective solutions for miners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrency mining, the need for efficient and affordable repair services is more important than ever,&rdquo; said Jonathan Bertrand, CEO of D-Central. &ldquo;With the &lsquo;Hash No Cash&rsquo; program, we&rsquo;re making it easier for miners to maintain and repair their hardware, allowing them to keep their capital for strategic investments such as new hardware purchases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Hash No Cash&rdquo; program also contributes to environmental sustainability by reducing electronic waste. By repairing and repurposing broken hardware, D-Central minimizes the demand for new equipment production, thereby reducing the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the program promotes decentralization in cryptocurrency mining. By making repaired hardware available to retail customers at affordable prices, D-Central is putting the power of ASICs into more hands, fostering the wider distribution of mining power.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D-Central is committed to driving change within the cryptocurrency mining industry,&rdquo; said Jonathan Bertrand. &ldquo;Our goal is not just to provide repair services, but to create solutions that are financially viable, environmentally friendly, and conducive to the decentralization of mining power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miners across North America are invited to take advantage of the &ldquo;Hash No Cash&rdquo; program. To learn more about the program or to get started, please visit: https://d-central.tech/</p>

<p>D-Central is a leading provider of cryptocurrency mining services, offering a wide range of solutions including ASIC repair services, mining support, and disinfection services.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Hut 8 Mining reports a 64% year-on-year hit to revenue in its Q1.</li>
<li>Craig-Hallum analyst sees downside in &ldquo;HUT&rdquo; to C$2.0 a share.</li>
<li>Hut 8 Mining stock is now down nearly 30% versus its YTD high.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hut 8 Mining Corp is trading down on Thursday after reporting a massive year-on-year decline in its first-quarter revenue.</p>
<h2>Notable figures in Hut 8 Mining Q1 report</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned C$0.47 a share versus C$0.15 a share loss expected</li>
<li>Revenue tanked a more than expected 64% to C$19 million</li>
<li>Mined 475 bitcoin &ndash; down roughly 50% versus a year ago</li>
<li>Increased its installed hashrate in the quarter to 2.6 EH/s</li>
</ul>
<p>At its Ontario facility, Hut 8 Mining had to switch off roughly 8,000 machines because of a dispute with Validus Power Corp. In the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hut-8-reports-operating-and-financial-results-for-q1-2023-301821982.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a>, CEO Jamie Leverton also said:</p>
<blockquote><p>In early 2023, we experienced a confluence of events: electrical issues at our Drumheller site caused equipment failures, fluctuating energy prices and increased network difficulty.</p></blockquote>
<p>Versus its year-to-date high, Hut 8 Mining stock is down nearly 30% at writing.</p>
<h2>Is Hut 8 Mining stock worth buying?</h2>
<p>So far, only 1,000 of those machines in its Ontario facility are back online and <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/05/09/hut-8s-alberta-bitcoin-mine-running-at-15-installed-hashrate-due-to-electrical-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its Alberta mine</a> is running at just 15% of its installed hashrate.</p>
<p>Hut 8 Mining is currently in the process of merging with USBTC or <a href="https://hut8.io/investors/hut-8-and-usbtc-merger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Bitcoin Corp</a>. According to the Chief Executive:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have made progress on key regulatory files required to complete the transaction. We also reached an all-time operational high of 1.72 EH/s at our Medicine Hat facility.</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite underperformance, it may not be the best of ideas to take a position in this Canadian company today considering a Craig-Hallum analyst reiterated his &ldquo;hold&rdquo; rating on Hut 8 Mining stock this week. His C$2.0 price target suggests another 10% downside from here.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul class="decimal_type">
<li>The seed round raised the Odsy Network valuation at $250 million.</li>
<li>The round was led by Blockchange Ventures with participation of VCs, strategic partners, and investment DAOs.</li>
<li>The Odsy Network provides a secure and programmable access control layer for all of Web3 through dynamic decentralized wallets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Odsy Foundation, the non-profit organization developing the Odsy Network ecosystem, has successfully completed its seed round raising $7.5 million</p>
<p>The funding round attracted heavyweight VCs led by Blockchange Ventures, strategic partners, and investment DAOs including Rubik Ventures, No Limit Holdings, Node Capital, Insignius Capital, FalconX, SolrDAO, TPC and others.</p>
<h2>Need for interconnected decentralized solutions</h2>
<p>There has been a lack of infrastructure for decentralized access control driving Web3 developers to create centralized solutions to the increasing centralization of Web3. However, the recent <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/ftx-collapse-hearing-kevin-oleary-says-binance-caused-the-ftx-implosion/">collapse of centralized Web3 giants like FTX</a> and <a href="https://coinjournal.net/celsius/">Celsius&nbsp;</a>proved that centralized aces control is an existential threat to Web3.</p>
<p>Odsy Network has identified the gap and it provides a secure and programmable access control layer for all of Web3 through a new crypto primitive &ndash; dWallets (dynamic decentralized wallets). The dWallets are programmable and have transferable signing mechanisms meaning they can be used to sign transactions on practically any blockchain.</p>
<p>Since dWallets are programmable, Web3 builders can use the Odsy Network to implement any access control logic in a completely decentralized way. This enables Web3 developers to recreate existing solutions such as exchanges, custodians, bridges etc. in a trustless way. The developers can also create brand-new solutions that were not possible before.</p>
<p>The Executive Director at Odsy Foundation, and former CEO of Algorand Foundation, Sean Lee, commented saying:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The potential of new solutions, ones that demonstrate real-world use cases but cannot be built in today&rsquo;s fragmented crypto ecosystems, is extremely compelling for ambitious Web3 builders. dWallets is an entirely new way to imagine how digital assets should be accessed and policy managed in a multi-chain world, which is especially important as the industry explores the emergence of tokenized assets and their corresponding risk &amp; compliance requirements.&rdquo;</em></p>
<h2>Over 10&nbsp;projects&nbsp;already building on Odsy Network</h2>
<p>While the Odsy Network is still in development, there are already more than 10 projects actively building in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Many of these projects are VC-backed including dWallet Labs which raised $5M in a round led by Digital Currency Group and Node Capital, and Fun which raised $3.9M in a round led by Tinder Co-Founder Justin Mateen&rsquo;s JAM Fund.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Milady (LADYS) price jumped more than 10,000% in a few hours after an Elon Musk tweet of a meme image.&nbsp;</li>
<li dir="ltr">LADYS price was up over 3,200% at the time of writing as major exchanges listed the meme token.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Milady is ranked 238th by market cap on CoinGecko, with $122 million in MC.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The memecoin carnival just got another trendy token as the price of Milady (LADYS), which has no particular association with the NFT project Milady, soared more than 50x in 24 hours.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Recent dominance of the meme token trend by Pepe (PEPE) took a backseat as Crypto Twitter reacted to developments around the token.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As of writing, the LADYS token was trading around $0.000000133704, roughly 3800% up with a trading volume of over $221 million (up 11,914% in the past 24 hours).</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;According to data on CoinGecko, Milady has a maximum supply of 888 trillion LADYS.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What&rsquo;s behind the Milady (LADYS) price explosion?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The massive price gains early 11 May, 2023 pushed the value of the new meme coin up over 18,000% from its all-time low reached just 24 hours earlier on 10 May.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Milady price took to the moon on Wednesday, with the reaction to a tweet by <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a> that highlighted the Milady NFT, jumpstarting a flurry of buy activity. The Musk<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1656326406618619910" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;<u>tweet</u></a> aside, multiple exchanges, including Bybit, Bitget, Huobi, Gate.io and MEXC Global have listed or announced listing support LADYS.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">&#128227; <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bybit?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bybit</a> is excited to announce the upcoming listing of <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24LADYS&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$LADYS</a> on our Spot trading platform! <a href="https://twitter.com/miladymemecoin?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@miladymemecoin</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p dir="ltr">But on what Milady is and looks to offer, details on the memecoin&rsquo;s<a href="https://milady.gg/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;<u>website</u></a> states:</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>$LADYS coin has no association with Charlotte Fang or her creation Milady Maker. This token is simply paying homage to a NFT collection we all love and recognize. $LADYS is a meme coin with no intrinsic value or expectation of financial return. There is no formal team or roadmap. The coin is completely useless and for entertainment purposes only</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Milady price outlook</h2>
<p dir="ltr">In terms of price performance, whether LADYS price can sustain the upside momentum remains to be seen. But one thing likely to happen is for price to dump as people take profits.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Small investors wil have to be wary of the potential sell-off likely to be triggered by large holders, the so-called whales. These entities hold trillions of LADYS tokens and could look to dump on retail. <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/pepe-price-dives-after-whale-transfers-trillions-of-tokens-to-binance/">PEPE dumped</a> earlier this week as a whale sent trillions of tokens to a major crypto exchange.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Crypto news alert and smartmoney on-chain account Lookonchain highlights one such whale as DWF Labs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/ The developer of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Milady?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Milady</a> added the top 3 holders of <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24LADYS&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$LADYS</a> to the Blacklist.</p>

<li>Red Bull Doodle Art is a global competition that challenges students to create original doodles that showcase their creativity and artistic abilities.</li>
<li>Crossmint is a leading NFT infrastructure provider.</li>
<li>Burnt Toast is the Co-Founder of the Doodles.</li>
</ul>
<p>Crossmint, Red Bull Doodle Art, and Burnt Toast have joined forces to help student artists with an opportunity to create and mint their own NFTs.</p>
<p>This year, an NFT component has been added to the Red Bull Doodle Art global competition, giving winners the opportunity to have their artwork minted on-site at the world final and auctioned. Crossmint will play a vital role as the platform and infrastructure collaborator providing all participants with a Proof of Participation NFT and a wallet, with seamless onboarding powered by Crossmint.</p>
<h2>Giving students an opportunity to mint NFTs</h2>
<p>Students can now own and monetize their artwork through NFTs.</p>
<p>Commenting on the collaboration, Crossmint co-founder Rodri Fernandez Touza said:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;NFTs are transforming the art world, empowering creators to build unique experiences and monetize in new ways. However, web3 is still too complex for most artists. We hope this competition, and the seamless crypto onboarding experience powered by Crossmint&rsquo;s wallet and minting infrastructure will empower a new generation of artists to get involved with NFTs&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Red Bull Doodle Art, with the support of Crossmint, will provide a unique opportunity for student artists to showcase their creativity to a global audience. 120,000 participants across 62 countries have already submitted their doodles. Students will get assistance from Burnt Toast, the illustrator, designer, animator, and muralist behind the doodles during the campaign.</p>
<p>One national winner from each country will proceed to the World Final in Amsterdam slated for May 25 to May 27, 2023.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Bitcoin price prediction: BTC struggles to maintain price above $27,500</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin, the world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has been underperforming so far this week. Over the last seven days, BTC has lost more than 7% of its value and dropped below the $28k mark.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The leading cryptocurrency recorded a sharp dump on Wednesday following reports that <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/why-is-the-crypto-market-down-today-btc-briefly-slips-below-27k/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>there was a transaction&nbsp;</u></a>from the United States government&rsquo;s BTC wallet.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin recovered from its dump yesterday and went on to trade above the $27,700 level. However, the poor performance has resumed, and BTC has lost more than 2% of its value today.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At press time, the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>price of Bitcoin</u></a> stands at $27,320 and could dip lower over the next few hours.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">BTC could dip below $27k soon</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin has been underperforming since the United States inflation figures came out earlier this week. The inflation figure in the United States remains high, indicating that the Federal Reserve could continue with its interest rate hikes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If that happens, <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/bitcoin-drops-after-us-inflation-data-24k-is-the-next-target/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>BTC could drop below the $24k level</u></a> in the near term as investors adjust to the new reality.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, if the Federal Reserve pauses its rate hikes, assets like Bitcoin could be one of the biggest winners.</p>

</div>
<p dir="ltr">In terms of technical analysis, it is not looking good for Bitcoin in the short term. The MACD line is below the neutral zone, indicating that there are more sellers than buyers in the market.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Furthermore, the 14-day RSI of 38 shows that Bitcoin could enter the oversold region if the current market condition persists.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Key takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">DEA operates mainly in Southeast Asia and has players from more than 100 countries worldwide</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">DEA seeks to grow its ecosystem via partnerships with third-party games, NFT art collections and metaverse projects.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Artists on DEA make money via royalties</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Digital Entertainment Asset (DEA), the operator of the PlayMining GameFi platform, is co-developing a groundbreaking new social good use case for GameFi: a game that incentivises real-world social contribution to the maintenance of shared community infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">As a P2E platform, players get to play fun video games and are rewarded with P2E tokens when they inspect physical infrastructure in communities where understaffed government utility organizations can&rsquo;t patrol on their own.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We sat down with the DEA team to discuss their project, the impact on the web3 ecosystem, and how they intend to expand to other countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em><strong>Question:&nbsp;</strong></em><em><strong>DEA operates majorly in Southeast Asia. Are you present in all Southeast Asian countries, and do you have plans to expand to other parts of the continent?</strong></em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The majority of our users are from Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Taiwan, but we also have players from more than 100 countries worldwide, including most of SEA. We aim to build games with worldwide international appeal and hope to attract players from all regions and walks of life.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One of our company&rsquo;s primary goals is to use our games to help people. We&rsquo;ve started with Southeast Asia because GameFi has grown very popular there as a means of earning supplemental income. We would love to see GameFi also be embraced in other regions with impoverished communities, and grow our community in any place where people can derive real-world value from playing our games.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em><strong>Q: According to your website, DEA is a PlayMining GameFi platform. Do you combine GameFi and crypto mining, or does PlayMining stand for something else?</strong></em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The &ldquo;mining&rdquo; in the platform&rsquo;s &ldquo;PlayMining&rdquo; name only refers to the ability of players to earn $DEP tokens by playing games. It is not &ldquo;mining&rdquo; in the strictest sense of the word, but it can feel like it to players, who receive real cryptocurrency rewards by completing quests in games.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While DEA operates its own <a href="https://dappradar.com/dep/games/playmining-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>blockchain</u></a> and <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/deapcoin/markets/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>token</u></a>, it does not engage in the mining of external cryptocurrencies. DEAPcoin launched in 2018, with 30 billion $DEP tokens created at Genesis. We reserved 20 billion $DEP, or roughly 66% of the total number of tokens, for ecosystem incentives and distribution on the PlayMining platform as rewards for playing our games and for DeFi services like staking</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em><strong>Q: Are there specific locations with physical infrastructure that DEA players can inspect? How do you determine the locations that need inspection?</strong></em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">We cannot release much information about the TEPCO game, as it is still in its early phase of development. However, we can say that such locations would be determined by our partner, who is collaborating with us on this game, Greenway Grid Global (GGG).</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to their website, GGG is a joint venture established in Singapore in part by TEPCO as a vehicle &ldquo;to invest and operate overseas power transmission and distribution business and next-generation infrastructure business, and incubate new business, as well as to nurture global leaders&hellip;with the Asian market being the main target.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em><strong>Q: DEA has over 2.7 million users worldwide. How do you intend to provide more value to your existing users and capture more users?</strong></em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">We are constantly expanding the PlayMining platform by developing new P2E games for our community to enjoy, and all of our games bring players into the DEAPcoin ecosystem with P2E rewards and an NFT marketplace. We also actively seek out partnerships with other companies and influencers to build content for PlayMining, such as new third-party games, NFT art collections, metaverse projects, events and promotions and so on.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One of our primary goals with our partnerships is to be wholly transparent and fair&mdash;we pay out royalties on the PlayMining NFT marketplace, for example, and it is much cheaper for game studios to launch on PlayMining than on other major distribution platforms such as Nintendo or PlayStation, which take an exorbitant 30% cut of profits. We have built our platform to be amazing not only for our community of 2.7 million users but also for our partners, to ensure PlayMining&rsquo;s sustainability.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another way that we can bring more value to our existing users is by buying back DEAPcoin from the market. Over time, we anticipate that this will help stabilize the DEAPcoin token price.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We are also always looking for new ways to make a social impact through GameFi. We believe that there is immense potential for GameFi to create a great amount of real value in the world.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em><strong>Q: DEA supports third-party indie game studios. How do you incorporate them and their games into your platform?</strong></em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">We partner with third-party game studios to develop new games on the PlayMining GameFi platform. We allow these companies to incorporate DEAPcoin into their P2E reward structure, and they can also have their own token economies. We also give them access to sell NFTs related to their games on the <a href="https://daa.playmining.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>PlayMining NFT</u></a> and <a href="https://nft-premier.playmining.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>PlayMining NFT Premier</u></a> marketplaces, where they can build out their creative IPs, and they also earn royalties on secondary sales of their NFTs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">PlayMining provides this support for indie game studios because we know first-hand how brutally competitive the video game industry can be. Distributors and other middlemen typically steal most of the profits, leaving small game developers with very little overhead for marketing and building out their IPs with supplementary content such as fan art, animation and other products. And in this industry, if you don&rsquo;t monetize your IP, it can be difficult to achieve longevity for games. We aim to change all that by leveling the playing field with a fairer system that doesn&rsquo;t exploit our partners.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em><strong>Q: How do official brand artists&nbsp;</strong></em><em><strong>and fan artists</strong></em><em><strong>&nbsp;earn money on the PlayMining NFT marketplace?</strong></em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">DEA pays out royalties to both official artists and creators of fan art who sell NFTs on the PlayMining NFT marketplace. There are also many NFTs on our marketplace that give players the ability to earn even more DEAPcoin in PlayMining games. For example, there is a collection of &lsquo;Farmland NFTs&rsquo; that, when used in the PlayMining coin pusher game &lsquo;Lucky Farmer&rsquo;, increases the odds of the player scoring winning slot machine combinations such as the triple-seven &lsquo;Fever Time&rsquo; jackpot that makes $DEP rain onto the playing field.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">1xBit Benefits</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Now, let&rsquo;s discuss some of the benefits of betting at 1xBit.</p>
<p><strong>Numerous Attractive Promotions</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The Super Six tournament is not the only tournament at 1xBit that will be available to you once you sign up. As a matter of fact, this betting platform has made it a point of duty to release frequent tournaments at least once every new month to give its users more reasons to play. If you think the prizes for the Super Six tournament are attractive, wait until you see what the other tournaments have in store.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Over 40 Sports Available</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">One area that many sports betting platforms struggle is their availability of betting markets. However, this is not the case with 1xBit. There are currently over 40 sports that you can bet on at 1xBit, with football being one of the most popular ones.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Only Crypto Payment Methods Accepted</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">1xBit stands out as one of the few betting sites out there that only accepts <a href="https://coinjournal.net/cryptocurrencies/">crypto</a> as the means of making payment. This innovation has changed the face of processing payments on betting platforms, as it has made it easier and faster to process transactions. Not only does 1xBit only accept crypto as a means of making payments, it makes sure that you have over 40 altcoins to choose from.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Huge Welcome Bonus</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">One of the major perks of joining the 1xBit community is the huge welcome bonus waiting for you. Once you are fully registered, you are eligible for a 300% welcome bonus on your 1-4th deposits. <em>Promo code&nbsp;</em><em><strong>SUPER1X&nbsp;</strong></em><em>will boost your first deposit bonus up!</em></p>
<p><strong>Fast Payouts</strong></p>
<p>A major challenge for most bettors that patronize traditional betting platforms is how long it can take to receive payouts. Because of the middlemen involved in processing the payments for those platforms, it could take as long as five days to get your winnings withdrawn. However, considering that 1xBit only uses crypto, you can be sure to get your payouts processed in a few hours.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><br></strong>Get in on the action and win even more prizes in the upcoming draw of the Super Six tournament. For more information about promotions at 1xBit, follow the platform on the social media handles below: &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Marathon Digital, a leading mining company, published strong results.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The company mined more bitcoins in Q1 than in the same quarter in 2022.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Marathon&rsquo;s technicals on the daily chart are bullish.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Marathon Digital (NASDAQ: MARA) stock price moved sideways after the company published encouraging results. The shares were trading at $10.22, where they have been in the past few days. They have jumped by more than 277% from the lowest level in December.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Marathon Digital earnings</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Marathon Digital, one of the best-known Bitcoin mining companies, published strong financial results, helped by higher&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/"><u>bitcoin</u></a> prices. Bitcoin jumped from a low of $15,500 in the quarter and ended the quarter at about $28,000.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Marathon&rsquo;s metrics were better than where they were in the same period last year. It produced 2,195 bitcoins in the quarter as the average BTC produced per day were 24.4. Its installed hash rate jumped to 15.4.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">As a result, Marathon Digital&rsquo;s revenue jumped to $51.1 million as the gains on the sale of bitcoin rose to $17.6 million. It boosted its cash balances by $12 million and reduced its overall debt by $50 million. It now has over $124 million in cash and 11,466 bitcoin. In a statement, the company&rsquo;s CEO&nbsp;<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19328088-marathon-digital-holdings-reports-first-quarter-2023-results?hasComeFromMpArticle=false" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said</u></a>:</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;With more hash rate coming online in the months ahead, Marathon remains on track to reach our 23 exahash goal near the middle of this year. We remain optimistic that we can achieve our primary growth targets.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">MARA stock price forecast</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/04/11/1683807809321-f8f575c0-2d7b-438a-844c-43a432a9c899.png" style="width: 626px;height: 304.653px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="626" height="304.653"></p>
<p dir="ltr">So, is Marathon stock a good buy? The future of the stock will depend on the Bitcoin price in the next few months. If Bitcoin continues to underperform, then I suspect that the share price will remain under pressure in the next few months.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It is hard to predict whether bitcoin price will rise or retreat. However, with the Nasdaq 100 index in a bull market, there is a likelihood that bitcoin will also bounce back soon.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The case for a higher bitcoin price is also made by the fact that America&rsquo;s inflation is easing, which means that the Fed will embrace a strategic pause. Further, Bitcoin tends to do well ahead of halving event. Halving will happen in April. As a result, analysts who talked to Bloomberg said that BTC could surge to as high as $100k in the next few years.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Technicals are also supportive of the MARA stock price. The shares are slightly above the ascending trendline shown in red and the 50-day exponential moving averages. Therefore, there is a possibility that the shares will jump to the next resistance point at $12.77, which is about 28% above the current level.</p>
