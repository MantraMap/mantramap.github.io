<p>In May, Hong Kong&#8217;s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) will release guidance on the licensing framework for crypto. Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-27/hong-kong-sfc-to-issue-crypto-exchange-license-guidelines-in-may?leadSource=uverify%20wall">reported</a> that SFC CEO Julia Leung announced the ongoing consultation process for the regulatory framework for crypto entities in the city has received over 150 responses so far. <br /><br />The new regulatory framework will be effective from June 1, and it will mandate crypto platforms to register with the authorities in the city. <br /><br />Licensed exchanges can then offer cryptocurrency trading of major cryptocurrencies, such as <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-and-ethereum-rebounds-as-cpi-indicates-falling-inflation/">Bitcoin and Ethereum</a>, to retail traders. Hong Kong aims to become a financial hub for cryptocurrency in Asia, with two exchanges already offering crypto trading services under the supervision of the Hong Kong SFC. <br /><br />Several other exchanges might follow suit, as the city&#8217;s banking sector also offers <a href="https://www.digfingroup.com/hong-kong-crypto/">support</a> for crypto firms. However, some offshore exchanges have started restricting Hong Kong users due to regulatory demands. <br /><br /><a href="https://www.bitget.com/en/support/articles/12560603782171">Bitget</a>, for instance, has announced it will no longer provide services for Hong Kong users and that its Hong Kong users must transition to its subsidiary, BitGetX HK, which will apply for a license under the Hong Kong Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) regime.</p>

<p>Circle has <a href="https://www.circle.com/blog/usdc-cctp-an-open-dollar-platform-for-developers">launched</a> its Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP), a new product that allows developers to move the USDC stablecoin between Ethereum and Avalanche with ease.<br /><br />The move removes the need for older methods of cross-chain transfers, which require locking and minting assets, and allows users to <em>&#8220;burn and mint&#8221;</em> or<em> &#8220;teleport&#8221;</em> USDC between blockchains. <br /><br />This means customers will be able to transact with USDC without needing to know which blockchain their assets are on, as apps that use CCTP will allow for seamless support of different native versions of USDC. More than 10 apps, including Ethereum wallet Metamask and Solana bridge Wormhole, have reportedly adopted CCTP to date. <br /><br /><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/circle-usdc-issuer-hits-back-against-sec-action-with-facts-dispels-fud/">Circle</a> also plans to make CCTP <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/circle-delivers-usdc-interoperability-across-ecosystems-with-mainnet-launch-of-cross-chain-transfer-protocol-301807557.html">available</a> on various other chains throughout 2023. Although USDC is already available on a variety of blockchains, CCTP will allow for easy movement across those blockchains. <br /><br />With a market cap of $30 billion, USDC is currently the second-largest stablecoin after Tether. <br /><br />In March, the asset briefly lost its peg with the US dollar, but Circle was able to access the $3.3 billion of USDC backing it had stored with Silicon Valley Bank, and USDC quickly regained its intended $1.00 price peg.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>During the early hours of Wednesday morning, crypto prices experienced an overnight surge. <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-predicted-to-soar-to-100k-by-2024-declares-standard-chartered/">Bitcoin</a>&#8216;s value rose by 3.7% over the past day, according to Binance data via <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">TradingView</a>, and was trading at $28,722 at the time of this post. Ether also saw a 2.2% increase in value during the same period. The increase in crypto prices coincided with banking issues at First Republic, a U.S. bank that saw $102 billion in deposit outflows during Q1 2023, $72 billion more than expected. The banking woes have also led to broader banking concerns, <a href="https://en.swissquote.com/newsroom#">according</a> to Swissquote.<br /><br />Standard Chartered declared that the recent U.S. banking issues have been the catalyst for Bitcoin&#8217;s rally to above $30,000 and a return to the cryptocurrency&#8217;s core use case. They believe that the <em>&#8220;crypto winter is over,&#8221;</em> a sentiment that has been echoed by other experts, such as Markus Thielen from Matrixport, who <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7056762542936772608/">predicts</a> that the price of Bitcoin could reach $45,000 by year-end.<br /><br />JPMorgan analysts have warned that Ether may face further selling pressure after Binance initiated Ethereum withdrawals this week, which could <em>&#8220;put further pressure on ETH over the coming weeks.&#8221;</em> Despite taking up to 15 days to be fulfilled, the withdrawals could still affect ether&#8217;s value. Additionally, liquid staking protocol Lido Finance plans to enable ether withdrawals in May.<br /><br /><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/binance-accused-of-deliberately-flouting-laws-by-cftc-chief/">Binance</a> also announced its liquid staking token, set to launch on Thursday. The recent dip in the crypto market caused futures traders going long to suffer over $700 million in liquidations, and the recent surge resulted in shorts suffering a similar fate, with about $77 million in short positions across derivatives exchanges being liquidated in the past 24 hours, mostly across Binance, OKX, and Bybit.</p>

<p>South Korean investigators have revealed that approximately $8.6 million<a href="https://www.digitalasset.works/news/articleView.html?idxno=2310&amp;utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter"> remains</a> in the Sygnum Bank account of Do Kwon, the CEO of Terraform Labs (TFL), while the investigation into his company is ongoing. Sygnum, a crypto bank established in Switzerland, was founded in 2017.<br /><br />Earlier this year, the U.S. <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/u-s-congress-to-address-stablecoin-legislation-and-sec-oversight/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) reported that Kwon transferred a large sum of Bitcoins, valued at about $258 million, to a Swiss bank, which was later identified as Sygnum. The head of a financial securities crime investigation team in South Korea recently announced that they are keeping a close watch on the Bitcoin holdings of the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG).<br /><br />It was also disclosed during a press conference, following the indictment of several individuals without detention, that around $100 million had been cashed out and moved to the Sygnum account, as noted in the SEC complaint. <br /><br />Officials explained that the large sum of money had been allocated for various purposes and was not entirely present in the Sygnum account. Some of the funds were transferred to a law firm&#8217;s account as payment for legal services, leaving roughly $8.6 million in the account.<br /><br />Both South Korean and U.S. investigative agencies have requested a freeze on the Sygnum account, but it is still unknown whose appeal will take precedence.<br /><br />Swiss authorities and banks are obligated to present evidence before any decision can be reached. The investigators reiterated their commitment to assisting victims quickly and emphasized the need for Kwon&#8217;s extradition to South Korea.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bybit-introduces-merkle-tree-verified-proof-of-reserves/">Bybit</a>, a crypto exchange headquartered in <a href="https://twitter.com/sumitkapoor16/status/1648377443026345984">Dubai</a>, announced that it will require know-your-customer (KYC) checks on all its services starting May 8, 2023. <br /><br />Existing users who have not completed identity verification by that date will only be allowed to close existing open positions or orders, return loans, or withdraw. <br /><br />The policy shift was hinted at in December 2022, when Bybit introduced KYC requirements for peer-to-peer trading and some NFT services. Bybit has implemented various security measures to protect its users&#8217; funds, including multi-signature cold wallets, DDoS protection, and two-factor authentication. <br /><br />The exchange also regularly performs security audits and maintains an insurance fund to cover any potential losses due to security breaches. By making KYC mandatory for all users, the exchange aims to prevent fraud, money laundering, and other illicit activities while ensuring compliance with global regulations.<br /><br />The exchange did not offer any explanation for the move, but the decision comes amid increased regulatory scrutiny of crypto exchanges worldwide, particularly in the U.S. Bybit is among the many crypto firms based in Dubai, and it<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-29/crypto-com-bybit-announce-plans-to-set-up-operations-in-dubai"> relocated</a> its headquarters from Singapore to Dubai last year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/24/bitcoin-btc-price-could-hit-100000-by-end-2024-standard-chartered.html?&amp;qsearchterm=bitcoin">note published</a> by Standard Chartered on Monday, the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and other mid-tier U.S. lenders has strengthened the case for Bitcoin as a decentralized, trustless and scarce digital asset. <br /><br />Analyst Geoff Kendrick believes that the much-touted &#8220;crypto winter&#8221; is finally over, and he sees potential for <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-plunges-below-30000-amid-economic-concerns/">Bitcoin</a> to reach $100,000 by the end of 2024. Kendrick suggests that the current stress in the traditional banking sector is highly conducive to Bitcoin&#8217;s outperformance and validates the original premise for Bitcoin. <br /><br />Furthermore, Kendrick notes that, given Bitcoin&#8217;s advantages, its share of the total digital asset market cap could move into the 50–60% range in the next few months. The cryptocurrency was trading at $27,413 as at the time of this post. <br /><br />Kendrick argues that the stabilization of risk assets and speculation that the Federal Reserve will ease monetary tightening further means the pathway to $100,000 is becoming clearer. Proponents of Bitcoin believe that it is an asset worth diversifying into in times of economic distress. <br /><br />As the theory goes, Bitcoin has a limited supply of 21 million bitcoins, meaning it should appreciate as demand for alternative assets grows to avoid the effects of high inflation. Standard Chartered isn&#8217;t the only one predicting a strong rally in Bitcoin&#8217;s price. <br /><br />Multiple crypto industry insiders forecast Bitcoin to hit a new all-time high in 2023. Some crypto investors are pointing to the anticipation of the next so-called Bitcoin &#8220;halving&#8221; as a potential catalyst for another monster rally in the coin&#8217;s price.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/gemini-announces-support-for-new-7-tokens-including-defi-gaming-and-nfts/">Gemini</a>, the cryptocurrency exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins, is launching a new platform called the Gemini Foundation, which will offer its first derivatives contract exclusively to users outside of the US. <br /><br />The platform&#8217;s first contract will be a BTC perpetual contract denominated in Gemini dollars, with an ETH/GUSD perpetual contract to follow. This move is aimed at allowing eligible customers to leverage their crypto assets to manage risk, generate returns, and gain directional exposure.<br /><br />Gemini has <a href="https://www.gemini.com/blog/introducing-gemini-foundation-a-non-us-crypto-derivatives-platform">announced</a> that the platform will be available in several countries, including Singapore, Hong Kong, India, Argentina, Bahamas, Bermuda, Brazil, El Salvador, Israel, Nigeria, South Africa, South Korea, Switzerland, Thailand, and Turkey. Gemini&#8217;s CEO Tyler Winklevoss has also revealed that the exchange has plans to expand outside of the US, with a new CEO for the Asia-Pacific region and an upcoming office in India.<br /><br />The launch of the Gemini Foundation comes at a time when US exchanges are increasingly turning their focus to foreign markets due to the complex regulatory environment in the US. <br /><br />The Gemini Foundation will provide an opportunity for users in eligible countries to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies through a new derivatives platform. Gemini&#8217;s move to expand its presence in international markets is expected to create more opportunities for users globally to access and trade cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>Bitcoin and <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ether-sets-daily-record-in-outflow-from-centralized-exchanges/">Ether</a> experienced significant price drops on Friday, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq indexes remained relatively stagnant throughout the day. <br /><br />TradingView data showed that Bitcoin&#8217;s value had declined by 3.5% in the last 24 hours, with a trading value of $27,271, while Ether was down almost 5%. The cause for the downward trend in the volatile digital currency market is not always clear, but some suggest that it could be due to a decrease in excitement among speculators. <br /><br />Matt Klein, a portfolio strategist at Nascent, noted that DOGE&#8217;s rally leading into 4/20 and the meme coin PEPE dominating on-chain activities are signs of euphoria that have started to make speculators risk-off. Daniel Matuszewski of CMS investment firm described the trend as &#8220;pre-selling before May and go away.&#8221;<br /><br />Additionally, the Financial Times<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/29c67711-377c-4435-9c90-280852374e93"> reported</a> that the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan would steer clear of future crypto investments after it wrote off a $95 million investment into the failed FTX exchange.<br /><br />The OTPP chief executive, Jo Taylor, said, &#8220;We&#8217;re still working through what exactly happened there and you&#8217;re going to be careful.&#8221; Meanwhile, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, chaired by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, has expressed its intention to tighten risk assessment rules for nonbank companies.<br /><br />The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq indexes closed the day with a modest gain of around 0.1%.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/kucoincom/status/1649382189715578882">KuCoin</a>, a crypto exchange based in Seychelles, has ranked XRP as the second-most traded token after Bitcoin (BTC). <br /><br />In the past 24 hours, XRP achieved a spot trading volume of $94 million, accounting for 11.16% of the total trading volume on the exchange. <br /><br />Meanwhile,<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-plunges-below-30000-amid-economic-concerns/"> Bitcoin</a> garnered $187 million in spot trading volume, making up 22.18% of the 24-hour trading volume. Notably, XRP was among the top five coins by weekly search popularity on KuCoin, which boasts more than 20 million users across 200 countries worldwide.<br /><br />In other news,<a href="https://twitter.com/bit_castle/status/1649338462083092481"> Bitcastle</a>, a crypto exchange in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, announced a promotion for the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP communities, offering a chance for one lucky winner to win $1,000 each day until April 23.<br /><br />At the time of writing, XRP&#8217;s trading value has dropped by 4.85% in the last 24 hours, trading at $0.467. The crypto market is currently experiencing profit-taking as investors react to the potential interest rate hike. The crypto market is also set to experience its third consecutive day of downturn, resulting in the liquidation of millions of dollars.<br /><br />Although <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/xrp-takes-lead-as-most-traded-token-on-this-major-korean-exchange-details/">XRP</a> trading volume has slightly increased by 9%, traders are watching for signals of the next market move. XRP has experienced a 13.63% decrease in April so far after recording a positive 42% surge in March.<br /><br />With the current market volatility, whales are moving their assets, as evidenced by WhaleAlert&#8217;s detection of a lump sum of 119,072,730 XRP worth $56,830,113 transferring between unknown wallets in the last 24 hours.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ss_friedman/status/1649122957954777099">Susan Friedman</a>, a Ripple executive, has praised the European Union&#8217;s (EU) progressive approach to cryptocurrency regulation following the passage of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) legislation by the EU Parliament. <br /><br />In a tweet, Friedman expressed her enthusiasm for the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/eu-report-central-banks-likely-safe-cryptocurrencies/">EU</a>&#8216;s sensible regulatory measures, which stand in contrast to the United States&#8217; enforcement-focused approach. She also highlighted Ripple&#8217;s eagerness to expand in the European market, joining other major <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/new-york-attorney-general-moves-to-shut-down-unregistered-crypto-firms/">crypto firms</a> such as Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken in welcoming the new legislation.<br /><br />MiCA aims to provide regulatory clarity and harmonization for crypto firms operating across Europe. With a significant majority of 517 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) voting in favor and only 38 voting against, the legislation now moves to its final formal vote in the Council of the EU on May 16.<br /><br />According to Circle&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/paddi_hansen/status/1649014582009110533">Patrick Hansen</a>, the regulation will take effect for stablecoin issuers in June 2024 and for all other crypto-asset service providers in December 2024, upon publication in the Official Journal of the EU.<br /><br />The EU&#8217;s primary objectives with MiCA are to protect consumers engaging in crypto transactions, create regulatory harmonization to allow companies to operate on an EU-wide basis, provide legal certainty for companies and institutions entering the space, and establish a leading role in global crypto regulation. This comprehensive framework offers companies a clear rulebook for various services, including token issuance, exchange, and custody, enabling fair competition and innovation.<br /><br />With the passage of MiCA, the EU is poised to become a global hub for crypto projects due to regulatory clarity and its large single market of 450 million consumers.</p>
