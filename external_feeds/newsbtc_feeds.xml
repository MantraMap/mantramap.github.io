					<description><![CDATA[Ethereum jumped and tested the $1,350 resistance against the US Dollar. ETH corrected lower, but the bulls are active near the $1,280 support. Ethereum was able to clear the $1,300 and $1,320 resistance levels. The price is now trading near $1,290 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,285 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase unless there is a clear move below the $1,280 support. Ethereum Price Tops Near $1,350 Ethereum price gained pace for a steady move above the $1,300 resistance zone. ETH even surpassed the $1,320 level and settled well above the 100 hourly simple moving average. However, the bears were active near the $1,350 zone. There were two attempts to clear the $1,350 resistance, but the bulls failed. As a result, there was a bearish reaction from $1,350, similar to bitcoin. Ether price declined below the $1,320 and $1,300 levels. There was a clear move below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,240 swing low to $1,350 swing high. The price is now trading near $1,290 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,285on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair seems to be stable above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,240 swing low to $1,350 swing high.

BTC even climbed above the $18,000 resistance zone and settled well above the 100 hourly simple moving average. The price traded as high as $18,387 before there was a bearish reaction. The Fed increased interest rates by 0.5%, sparking sharp moves in the market. BTC price reacted the downside and traded below the $18,000 support zone. There was a clear move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $16,880 low to $18,387 high.

					<description><![CDATA[Ethereum saw an increase in its price on Tuesday along with the rest of the crypto market following the positive CPI data release. The jump in price saw Ethereum finally beat the $1,300 price point after hovering around $1,200 coming out of the weekend. However, the digital asset had met significant resistance at the $1,350 price level, which could end up being a bearish development for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Aim Big After Recent Breakout Above $1,300 Ethereum Trades Are Wary Currently, Ethereum traders are still very on edge regarding the cryptocurrency. Even the Tuesday recovery has not done much to actually instill faith in buyers, especially given the Fed’s announcement that is expected to happen on Wednesday. Expectations remain narrow because even though inflation saw a slowdown, it still remains high at 7.1%. Given this, traders are still being conservative in their positions and are not placing too much emphasis on ETH at this time. This is expected to continue through much of the midweek trading day until Powell’s announcement is live. There are also expectations to follow depending on what stance the Fed takes this time around. Over the last couple of months, the Fed had been hawkish due to the rising inflation in the country. But given that inflation had actually come out lower this time around, it could see the Fed soften its stance. If not, then a continuous hawkish stance from the Fed would no doubt see a retracement in the crypto market, which could see Ethereum lose all of its gains from Tuesday. Binance FUD Affects ETH Over the last couple of days, the Binance crypto exchange had been the target to crypto users’ ire as questions about its reserves were raised. As a result, there was massive withdrawals from the exchange, with Binance Ethereum withdrawals accounting for the majority of ETH withdrawals from centralized exchanges over the past week. As it is now, there are still rumors that the exchange may be insolvent and some are beginning to prepare for another FTX-level event if Binance were to fall.  Naturally, this has led to caution among investors who expect a downtrend if such a thing were to happen. Related Reading: BNB Price Prediction: Breaking This Barrier Could Spark a Significant Surge Alternatively, the withdrawals from centralized exchanges could also point towards accumulation among ETH holders. The reduced volume on centralized exchanges could mean a bottom for the digital asset, and if the Fed announcement turns out to be positive, ETH is likely to see $1,400 before the close of day.]]></description>

<p>Given this, traders are still being conservative in their positions and are not placing too much emphasis on ETH at this time. This is expected to continue through much of the midweek trading day until Powell’s announcement is live.</p>
<p>There are also expectations to follow depending on what stance the Fed takes this time around. Over the last couple of months, the Fed had been hawkish due to the rising inflation in the country. But given that inflation had actually come out lower this time around, it could see the Fed soften its stance. If not, then a continuous hawkish stance from the Fed would no doubt see a retracement in the crypto market, which could see Ethereum lose all of its gains from Tuesday.</p>

Binance FUD Affects ETH
<p>Over the last couple of days, the Binance crypto exchange had been the target to crypto users’ ire as questions about its reserves were raised. As a result, there was massive withdrawals from the exchange, with Binance Ethereum withdrawals accounting for the majority of ETH withdrawals from centralized exchanges over the past week.</p>
<p>As it is now, there are still rumors that the exchange may be insolvent and some are beginning to prepare for another FTX-level event if Binance were to fall.  Naturally, this has led to caution among investors who expect a downtrend if such a thing were to happen.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the <a href="https://twitter.com/glassnodealerts/status/1602891130768707584?s=20&amp;t=ZszuWs9ZeMXVRTi1elxhxA" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">withdrawals from centralized exchanges</a> could also point towards accumulation among ETH holders. The reduced volume on centralized exchanges could mean a bottom for the digital asset, and if the Fed announcement turns out to be positive, ETH is likely to see $1,400 before the close of day.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world by trading volume, has been the target of massive FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt, for the uninitiated) over the last couple of days. After FTX collapsed, users in the space began to question if exchanges actually held enough in their reserves to honor all customers. Given what happened to FTX, is it possible for Binance to come out of this unscathed? Related Reading: Why Goldman Sachs Expects This Asset Class To Outperform Bitcoin Binance Withdrawals Intensify As the FUD spread across social media platforms, Binance users had taken to withdrawing their deposits from the exchange en masse. Data aggregator platform reported on Tuesday that Binance’s withdrawals had crossed $1.9 billion, and by the end of the day, reports were that the withdrawals were eventually higher than $3 billion in a single day. According to the data released, the withdrawals were one of the highest single-day volume for the crypto exchange, which understandably had users at the edge of their seats. However, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao had come out to quell fears, explaining that it was nowhere near the highest single-day withdrawals the exchange had processed. Zhao explained that Binance had seen higher volumes when the LUNA cryptocurrency had collapsed, as well as during the FTX implosion. Most of the FUD had stemmed from the ‘audit’ report from Mazars which had drawn criticism from some experts in the industry. The multiple tweets saying that the Mazars report did not qualify as an audit had gained traction, leading to the current situation. Can The Crypto Exchange Survive? So far, Binance has been able to wade through the enormous FUD without much of a problem. Reports on social media say that despite the large withdrawal volumes, the crypto exchange continues to honor all of them in a timely manner. Also, data on Nansen show that deposits into the crypto exchange has been high during this time, offsetting the outflows to a significant degree. This tweet retweeted by “CZ” includes a screenshot of Nansen’s dashboard that showed Binance inflows were almost as high as outflows, resulting in negative net flows of only $378 million for the 24-hour period. CEO Zhao has referred to the current FUD as a “stress test” that “helps to build the credibility for exchanges that passes the test.” Haters: Omg omg!! #binance saw over 6 bn in withdrawals yesterday!!But these fudders did not tell that it got more deposits (6.56B) than withdrawals.

					<description><![CDATA[Toincoin is trading at $2.30, gaining 10.61% in 24 hours. The price change in this period is 0.3172. The 24-hour low is $2.05, while the 24-hour high is $2.37. Despite the recent events in the crypto space, TON has enjoyed a positive price surge today, recording gains in a volatile crypto market. Related Reading: SEC Charges SBF Of Allegedly Conducting Fraud Schemes The trading volume is up by 40% at $66,552,790. According to CoinMarketCap, its market capitalization stands at $2,808,494,330. TON is currently ranked number 22 on the crypto market list showing massive investor attention. Its affiliation with Telegram has also helped the project to soar in popularity even if it has been rebranded. Although the TON coin is still some way off its all-time high value of $5.84, it has enjoyed a positive week and might close 2022 on a high note. What Is Behind Toncoin’s Price Gains? Toncoin is a decentralized blockchain (layer-1) built by the developers of the popular social messaging app Telegram. Toncoin utilizes a proof-of-stake mechanism which has increased its adoption time. This mechanism encourages investors to profit by staking their tokens for rewards rather than going through the rigors of mining. Toncoin price has seemingly surged due to investors rekindling their interest in the project. The Network uses sharding to operate its blockchains and is efficient and scalable. While the crypto winter has persisted and with the dip in bitcoin, investors are looking to diversify. Also, the general crypto market has seen little gains in the last two weeks despite investors&#8217; fears. TON Likely To Sustain Its Rally  TON&#8217;s support levels of 1.123 and 1.572 have been held. TON has broken through the resistance level of 1.835 with 2.998, the next level it will likely surpass. Overtaking the next resistance level will launch Toncoin into a full bull run. TON is currently trading above its 50-day and 200-day SMA. This shows that the assets&#8217; short-term and long-term price movements are positive. The formation of long green candles on the chart&#8217;s right side indicates the bullish pressure. The RSI reading is firmly in the overbought region at 72.48, meaning the asset is giving off a strong buy signal for investors.  The MACD (Moving Average Convergence/Divergence) is above its signal line and displays the positive price movement on the chart. TON will likely sustain this pressure and finish the year strong if the bulls don&#8217;t back out or a major market capitulation. Most crypto assets have fluctuated in the past weeks but are slowly beginning to show signs of life.

					<description><![CDATA[A research note from Goldman Sachs published on Monday has painted a bull case for gold over the price of bitcoin. The bank’s research note comes at a time when the entirety of the crypto market is facing adversity and the price of bitcoin is down more than 70% from its all-time high price at current levels. According to Goldman Sachs, gold actually presents the opportunity that investors seem to be looking for in bitcoin. Gold Is A Better Inflation Hedge In the research note, Goldman Sachs says it expects gold to perform better than bitcoin in the long run given its already established use cases. For one, gold remains a hedge against inflation and dollar debasement, as well as being a better portfolio diversifier compared to bitcoin.
