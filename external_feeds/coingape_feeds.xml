										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1290" height="726" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/24174845/Samsung_Electronics.jpg" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="Samsung company" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" /><p>Earlier this week, the Samsung Asset Management Company <a href="https://coingape.com/just-in-samsung-launches-bitcoin-futures-etf-amid-crypto-market-recovery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the launch of its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the Hong Kong market. The Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active ETF is basically a futures-based Bitcoin ETF.</p>
<p>As per the latest Bloomberg report, the Samsung fund unit is now planning to unveil more crypto products in the Hong Kong market. Over the last few months, Hong Kong regulators have shown their <a href="https://coingape.com/heres-how-hong-kong-is-preparing-to-take-away-singapores-retail-crypto-sector/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">affinity for crypto</a> and are planning to make the region a new crypto hub in Asia.</p>
<p>Samsung now sees an opportunity here and is closely monitoring Hong Kong&#8217;s rule book in case they decide to allow direct investments in crypto coins. Sam Park, Hong Kong chief executive for Samsung Asset Management <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/samsung-fund-unit-considers-more-hong-kong-crypto-products-after-etf-1.1869599" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> Bloomberg: “It really depends on how policy is going to be developed&#8221;. He further added that the local administration was clearly keen on developing a crypto hub.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong&#8217;s Pan to Attract Crypto Businesses</h3>
<p>As said, Hong Kong regulators are already laying out plans to attract more crypto businesses into the market. Initially, they plan to legalize retail trading and other digital assets ETF which can invest only in the futures traded on the CME platform.</p>
<p>However, Hong Kong regulators are watchful of all the developments in the broader crypto markets and have shown the need for a regulatory environment that offers compliance, transparency, and investor protection.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is well positioned to become Asia’s crypto gateway,” said Rebecca Sin, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. She is further expecting that by the end of 2023, there will be spot Bitcoin and Ether products in the market.</p>
<p>Just at a time when major players in the crypto space are facing huge challenges amid the market downturn, Samsung is making a move here. On the other hand, Hong Kong&#8217;s latest moves could help Asia establish itself as the next big hub for crypto investments.</p>

After a meteoric rise of 350%, the hype surrounding these cards faded and since then, sales have been falling off dramatically. But surprisingly, out of nowhere, a brand new NFT collection&#8211;called &#8220;Win Trump Prizes&#8221;&#8211;has <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://opensea.io/collection/win-trump-prizes/activity" rel="nofollow">popped</a> up on OpeanSea&#8217;s <a href="https://coingape.com/blog/best-nft-marketplaces-where-to-create-and-sell-nfts-in-2022/">NFT marketplace</a>; where users can now purchase tokenized rewards linked to the president for as low as $25 apiece.</p>
<h2>Win Trump Prizes NFT Collection</h2>
<p>If the artwork of the previous <a href="https://coingape.com/nft/">NFT collection</a> was of any appreciation, individuals now get the opportunity to claim a one-on-one Zoom meeting with Donald Trump for the price of 200 ETH ($277, 000), a ticket to a gala dinner for the price of 50 ETH ($69,000), a meeting with Trump for the price of 21.45 ETH ($30,000), and few more.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-135190" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/13001614/Screenshot-2023-01-13-001319.png" alt="" width="1531" height="706" /></p>
<h2>Donald Trump NFT Sales</h2>
<p>These NFT access passes, which have been minted on the  <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/polygon-matic/">Polygon</a> <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/">blockchain</a> have been airdropped to investors of NFT cards beginning a month ago. According to data from the public blockchain that was vetted by the OpenSea marketplace, the deployment is still in progress, and some NFT perk passes have been given to NFT buyers as recently as Thursday morning.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, the total volume generated by the sale of these digital collectibles has been close to 40 ETH, with a floor price of 0.0269 ETH &amp; a total of 669 owners. The sales figure pre-dominantly peaked during the December launch and has steadily slowed down until today, where it has seen a significant uptick of 20 transactions &amp; still counting.</p>

<p>Trump announced his first <a href="https://coingape.com/donald-trumps-nft-trading-cards-pump-350-in-value-upon-launch/">NFT Trading Cards</a> campaign after formally stating his bid for the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/united-states/">United States</a> presidency in 2024. The billionaire-cum-politician lost his attempt for re-election in 2020 after serving from 2017 to 2021. And, even though he has been made fun of for his NFTs, the surging media attention from news outlets and the hype among the NFT community seem to have largely benefitted the 45th U.S. president thus far.</p>

The Solana-based token, which abruptly sprang from nowhere and pushed its way into the top 200 cryptocurrencies by market value, was severely impacted by a major bearish trend late on Thursday noon.</p>
<h2>Why Is BONK Crashing?</h2>
<p>The generally-volatile <a href="https://coingape.com/markets">crypto market</a> has had a stunning 24-hour period, with the price of most cryptocurrencies rising significantly. With the whole crypto sector&#8217;s market valuation up 3.38% to $881.76 billion at the time of writing, the price of Solana&#8217;s viral memecoin BONK plummeted in comparison.</p>
<p>In spite of the fact that the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/solana-sol/">Solana</a> community has been rallying around the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a>, calling it to be &#8220;for the people, by the people,&#8221; its value has decreased by 35% in the past twenty-four hours. Given that it has significantly outperformed the market since the beginning of the year, it is not hard to relate the factors that led to its price decline.</p>

<p>BONK has been subject to huge massive <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/whale-accumulation/">whale accumulation</a> in the past couple of weeks, with reports of rich wallet investors buying millions, if not billions of the viral token. While zooming out of its price, the token still maintains a solid return on investment and remains a frontrunner in terms of price.</p>

<p>However, following the current bearish outburst, the fully diluted <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/market-capitalization/#:~:text=The%20term%20market%20capitalization%20or,coin%20at%20any%20given%20time.">market cap</a> has dropped by 32.61% to $102 million, while the 24-hour trading volume of the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoin</a> has increased by a whopping 200% to $36 million. This is a direct indication of the fact that a significant number of SOL whales are selling off their BONK holdings in order to reap enormous profits.</p>

<h2>BONK Price To Turn Bullish?</h2>
<p>On Jan 12, Solana NFT fans rejoiced over the release of the Bonkz <a href="https://coingape.com/nft/">NFT collection</a>, which immediately surpassed ABC, y00ts, and DeGods, in addition to a number of other well-known <a href="https://coingape.com/blog/best-nft-marketplaces-where-to-create-and-sell-nfts-in-2022/">NFT marketplaces</a> on Solana&#8217;s blockchain. After the completion of the initial sale, the developers of the NFT collection decided to burn a whopping 13,900,000,000 BONK tokens. The Solana community believes that the burning activities will help preserve the memecoin&#8217;s market worth over the long term.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>After being caught off guard by the failure of the FTX crypto exchange in November of 2022, DCG, a conglomerate that controls crypto broker Genesis, investment management company Grayscale, and other crypto media outlets &#8212; is attempting to raise fresh capital in order to recover from its financial predicament.

According to the latest reports published on Jan 12, <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/genesis/">Genesis Global</a> allegedly owes more than $3 billion to its creditors.</p>
<h2>DCG&#8217;s Genesis Owes $3 Billion</h2>
<p>According to people who are familiar with the matter, the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/dcg/">Digital Currency Group</a> is contemplating to sell off portions of its venture capital holdings. These holdings include at least 200 crypto-related projects, such as exchanges, banks, and custodians, located in at least 35 countries. The current valuations of all these are expected to be somewhere around $500 million, as per financial experts.</p>

<p>DCG has managed one of the largest venture portfolios in the cryptocurrency industry. It has provided financial support to a variety of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> exchanges, such as U.S.-based Kraken, Coinbase, and Blockchain.com. The crypto giant also backed Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s now-defunct <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a>, in which it made an investment of $250,000 in July 2021. Among the other businesses that DCG has invested in are the American bank Silvergate, the digital wallet company Circle, the crypto lottery app Jackpocket, <a href="https://coingape.com/blog/best-nft-marketplaces-where-to-create-and-sell-nfts-in-2022/">NFT marketplace</a> WENEW and wallet provider Rainbow.</p>
<h2>Genesis Amid Growing Tensions</h2>
<p>One of the largest lenders in the crypto market, Genesis, a fully owned subsidiary of DCG, allowed clients to lend out their cryptocurrencies in exchange for hefty yields. Nevertheless, in November of last year, it stopped customer withdrawals in light of &#8220;extraordinary market turmoil.&#8221; As reported earlier on CoinGape, <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/cameron-winklevoss/">Cameron Winklevoss</a>, the co-founder of the Gemini exchange, claimed that Genesis had lent more than $2.3 billion to the hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which resulted in a loss of $1.2 billion. And more importantly, as part of its Earn program, <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/gemini/">Gemini</a> stated that it had loaned more than <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-gemini-cofounder-blames-dcgs-barry-silbert-over-genesis-funds/">$900 million worth of customer deposits</a> to Genesis which is currently stuck; affecting around 340,000 customers in the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/united-states/">United States</a>.</p>
<p>Genesis’ debts also include $300 million to Dutch exchange Bitvavo, and also to customers of Donut, which is a crypto savings firm based out of California. In addition to the mounting pressures for Genesis, the latest <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcontent%2Feb22bfab-ef05-48ce-83de-ebb904a35dca" rel="nofollow">reports</a> also state a separate group of Genesis creditors who are currently being represented by the legal counsel from Proskauer Rose.</p>
<p>DCG is one of the largest and initial sponsors of digital assets and crypto enterprises &amp; was established in 2015 by Silbert, a prominent banker. In 2021, its <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/market-capitalization/#:~:text=The%20term%20market%20capitalization%20or,coin%20at%20any%20given%20time.">market capitalization</a> was estimated to reach a staggering $10 billion, while it received backing from blue-chip investors such as SoftBank, Ribbit Capital, and CapitalG, the venture arm of Alphabet.</p>

<p>As of writing, the Bitcoin (BTC) price stands at $18221.71, up 4.61% in the last 24 hours, according to <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/">CoinGape price tracker</a>. However, in the last one hour, BTC price is down by around 0.31%, after initially showing a price spike immediately after the data release. Similarly, the Ethereum (ETH) price is down by just 0.16% in reaction to the CPI inflation data release. However, the stock markets are upbeat with the news of inflation cooling down. Reacting to this, the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.google.com/search?q=nasdaq+index&amp;oq=nasdaq+&amp;aqs=chrome.2.69i57j69i64j0i131i433i512l4j69i60l2.3179j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">Nasdaq Composite Index</a> is up by 1.76% today.</p>
<h2>Good For Crypto Market In Long Term</h2>
<p>The Consumer Price Index is a key indicator that measures price change over a period of time. The index data is used by the US Fed to decide the rate of interest rise. The decrease in inflation is important for the economy in many fronts. The 6.50% year-on-year inflation rise is the lowest such rise in the US since October 2021. Although the crypto market had a knee jerk reaction of price decline to the CPI data, the co0ling down of inflation could be beneficial from traders&#8217; perspective.</p>
<p>Lowering inflation means that the average crypto trader has to spend lesser expenses for living costs. Hence, this means the traders will be able to save money for potential investment options like crypto.</p>

The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/consumer-price-index-cpi/">Consumer Price Index (CPI)</a>, an important economic metric that measures the average change in prices paid by consumers for various goods &amp; services, demonstrated a considerable drop in inflation for the month of December; bringing it to the lowest level in almost a year. With the latest CPI reading coming at 6.5%, it lends further credence to the argument of a declining inflation, which can act as a catalyst for the price of volatile assets like <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a>.</p>
<h2>U.S. CPI Reports 6.5% Inflation</h2>
<p>The Core CPI, which excludes the likes of volatile energy and food prices, rose 0.3% month-on-month, which exactly matches the market expectations. September’s 6.5% increase was the biggest jump since August 1982. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics&#8217; closely watched index, the underlying consumer prices advanced by the least in 15 months, therefore making it possible for the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/federal-reserve-system/">Federal Reserve</a> to further reduce the magnitude of interest rates it has been implementing in the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/united-states/">United States</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-135174" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/12190821/FmRo-7dXwAEpiZp.jpg" alt="" width="1042" height="447" /></p>
<p>Prices have also decreased dramatically on a month-to-month basis, with cuts seen across the board for gasoline, utility services, medical care services, and used vehicle prices. The price hikes seen at restaurants were more moderate than expected, while the prices of new vehicles resided unchanged.</p>
<h2>Market Reaction</h2>
<p>Stock futures dropped as the consumer prices report for December confirmed analysts&#8217; forecasts of a slowdown in inflationary pressures. Futures contracts that tracked the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 28 points, which is a gain of 0.1%. Futures on the S&amp;P 500 fell by 0.1%, while those on the Nasdaq-100 dropped by 0.2%.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://coingape.com/markets">crypto market</a> on the other hand has given mixed reactions, with the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC) price</a> hovering at $18,304; representing a 0.02% decline in the past 1 hour in contrast to a 4.88% increase in the last 24 hours. <a href="https://coingape.com/price/ethereum">Ethereum (ETH) price</a> breached the $1,405 mark, at the time of writing.</p>

<p>The spring of 2021 witnessed a surge in inflation, which was caused by a confluence of circumstances that led to price hikes reaching their highest levels since the stagflation era of the early 1980s. The pandemic caused a supply and demand imbalance, Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine had an effect on energy prices, and trillions of dollars in fiscal and monetary stimulus caused an abundance of money to hunt fewer goods that were caught up in supply chain problems.</p>

Traders anticipate a slowdown in rate hikes by the U.S. <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/federal-reserve-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Reserve</a> as inflation eases in 2023.</p>
<p>The BTC price rises over 5% in the last 24 hours as Wall Street economists expect a drop in December&#8217;s <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/consumer-price-index-cpi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Consumer Price Index</a> (CPI). However, the actual reason behind the rally is the technical breakout. Also, a fall in the U.S. dollar index (<a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/dxy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DXY</a>) below 103 after many months.</p>
<figure id="attachment_135140" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-135140" style="width: 736px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-135140" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/12181720/BTCUSDT_2023-01-12_18-16-53.png" alt="Bitcoin price" width="736" height="448" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-135140" class="wp-caption-text">Bitcoin Price in Daily Timeframe.

<p><a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-prediction-what-expect-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As reported earlier</a>, the Bollinger Bands indicator was forming narrow bands in the weekly timeframe. Thus, traders kept away from trading due to decreased volatility. Also, it caused the Bitcoin price to hold above $16.5K and rise above $17,500 in the last few days.</p>
<p>As expected, the end of the Bollinger Bands Squeeze saw Bitcoin price moving 5% higher in the last 24 hours. Moreover, indicates the BTC price will continue to move higher and hit $19K soon.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RSI</a> reaches the overbought zone and moves around 76. Therefore, the Bitcoin price shows strength and should continue to move higher in the next few weeks. The Exponential Moving Average also hints at a bullish price trend in the coming weeks as the 20-EMA looks to cross above the 50-EMA.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the BTC price is trading at $18,252. The 24-hour low and high are $17,337 and $18,268, respectively.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price After December&#8217;s CPI Release</h2>
<p>Wall Street banks expected a drop in the CPI for December as energy prices in December contributed the most to the slowdown. Gasoline costs declined nearly 12% from November to December.</p>
<p>Major banks such as Bank of America, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs expect the CPI data to come at 6.5%.</p>
<p>Crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe believes the CPI will most likely drop further, but the expectations of a massive drop as suggested by other experts are low. He expects the CPI can come in at 6.6% or 6.7%. Thereafter, the crypto market can witness a correction, before continuing the rally.</p>

There are a few ways in which you can survive the bitcoin <a href="https://coingape.com/education/what-is-a-bear-trap-in-crypto-and-how-does-it-work-beginners-guide/">bear market</a> without incurring major losses.</p>
<h2>The 5 ways to survive bear market are:</h2>
<h3>Think in terms of long term</h3>
<p>Long-term trends have shown that <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> has continuously increased throughout the years. History demonstrates that prices are likely to recover eventually owing to economic factors like scarcity, regardless of whether prices are declining due to a brief market correction or a more protracted bear market. Many people think that this restricted supply will lead to a long-term increase in the price of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrencies</a> like Bitcoin. Negative price movement can be seen as transient if you invest over a longer period of time (years rather than weeks or months).</p>
<p>Long-term holding has so far been a successful tactic, with Bitcoin emerging as maybe the most successful large asset of the previous ten years.</p>
<h3>Do not invest in one place in bear market</h3>
<p>The market for digital assets is very erratic. When bears are in control, it&#8217;s impossible to predict whether the price will fall much further or experience a relief bounce. You can employ a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/dca-dollar-cost-averaging/">dollar-cost averaging method or DCA</a> during this time. DCA assists you in spreading out your investments by making little investments.</p>
<p>You can purchase a particular cryptocurrency or a number of them when the price reaches your aim by dividing your funds. You can choose specific times of the day or week to buy the dip, as opposed to using up all of your money at once. If the price drops further in the future, you can use the allocated funds to purchase the cryptocurrencies so that when the price increases, you will benefit.</p>
<p><strong>Also read: </strong><a href="https://coingape.com/5-cryptocurrencies-to-look-out-for-this-weekend/?utm_source=24hrsupdateall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5 Cryptocurrencies To Look Out For This Weekend</a></p>
<h3>Scalp Investing</h3>
<p>In a bearish decline, scalp trading is an excellent choice due to the extreme volatility of the crypto market. Simply explained, scalping is the short-term purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies in order to generate modest but consistent profits. Over time, these gains accumulate to produce a respectable return.</p>
<p>During the bear phase, you can scalp trade using one of the two methods—manual or automated. In order to locate openings and closings when manually scalping, you must thoroughly examine the market utilizing real-time research. When using automated scalping, you can create a special trading plan based on your analysis and lower your trading risk even though you are not actively monitoring the market.</p>
<p>The market crashes due to internal and external issues like the breakdown of major crypto blockchains and macroeconomic factors such as rising inflation rates and tighter laws around the crypto sector. The methods described above can be a surefire way to make money even when the market is declining.</p>
<h3>Avoid being a FUD victim</h3>
<p>Keeping up with the most recent news and trends in the bitcoin industry is essential. Yet too much knowledge can be harmful. This is especially true during market downturns when it&#8217;s all too easy to let your emotions take over and place some transactions at the wrong time.</p>

<p>No one can foretell the future, and following your own research and drawing your own conclusions is always preferable to listening to someone else&#8217;s advice. Influencers and publications may occasionally have a financial stake in spreading <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fud/">FUD</a> or <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fomo-fear-of-missing-out/">FOMO</a> in order to steer the markets in a particular way. Always try to confirm with several sources while learning about the most recent developments throughout bitcoin marketplaces.</p>
<h3>Prepare yourself to ride out the downturn or grab profits</h3>
<p>Converting some of your volatile crypto holdings for more stable assets is one of the safest ways to minimize crypto volatility and protect yourself during a market downturn. This can assist an investor in &#8220;locking in&#8221; their balance, lowering risk, and eliminating the need for active portfolio management.</p>
<p>But keep in mind that selling everything at once, or capping, might easily result in cryptocurrency holders losing money if the market abruptly recovers. This is why it&#8217;s crucial to determine your level of acceptable profit and loss before you find yourself in a situation where you have to make choices quickly.</p>

In this context, there may be rise in trading activity for the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/meme-cryptocurrency/">memecoin</a>.

<p>In the last few days, even Binance appears to have placed its bets on the top 2 memecoin. As per <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/whale_alert/status/1612710833636757505?s=20&amp;t=D-LZG9wnuNygRcBHtzlIZA" rel="nofollow">Whale Alert data</a>, the crypto exchange had earlier in the week transferred a whopping 4 trillion SHIB to an unknown wallet.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;4,000,000,000,000 SHIB ($34,736,666) transferred from Binance to unknown wallet.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>SHIB Whale Activity Picks Up</h2>
<p>In addition, a latest alert showed that a massive transfer of SHIB occurred between unknown wallets. The memecoin is currently ranked 16 based on market cap while <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/dogecoin/">Dogecoin (DOGE)</a> holds the top memecoin position at rank 9. As of writing, SHIB price stands at $0.00000916, up 2.63% in the last 24 hours, according to <a href="https://coingape.com/price/shiba-inu/">CoinGape price tracker</a>. The price recovery in cryptocurrencies comes ahead of the US CPI data release for the month of December. The market expectation is that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the month would have declined.</p>
<p>The Whale Alert message said,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;3,323,256,285,484 #SHIB (30,458,751 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown wallet.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, the Shiba Inu burn rate also saw a spike in the last few days. The spike was considered as a result of anticipation around the much awaited Shibarium as well as SHIB whale activity. With each transaction on the Shibarium blockchain, <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-shiba-inus-shibarium-beta-launch-almost-here-says-official-portal/">Shiba Inu (SHIB) burn</a> is triggered. Along with this, the developers said that the Shibarium launch is almost there.</p>

However, global crypto has been registering a relief rally since the beginning of 2023.

The single largest transaction recorded has been of a whale buying more than 44.2 million XRP (approx worth $15.5 million) from Bitso, crypto exchange.

<p>As per reports, Nexo offices in the capital of Bulgaria are being raided by prosecutors from the national security and DANS along with the cooperation of foreign agents. The company is known for trading <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">crypto</a> globally.</p>
<p>Recently, the investors were called into the Bulgarian offices and were asked to invest in <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> and other cryptocurrencies with a promise of high returns. The percentage of the returns which were promised was much higher than the actual profit margin that the national banking firms and institutions provide.</p>
<p>The company is owned by a former parliament member and the son of the formal social minister from the NDSV party.</p>
<p>The raid is based on the suspicion that the Bulgarian office employees were working on the scheme of Ruja Ignatova, who also runs OneCoin. Popularly known as the Queen of Cryptocurrencies in the country, she is among the top 10 <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/fbi/">FBI</a> wanted list, also wanted by Interpol and Europol. <strong>Also read: </strong><a href="https://coingape.com/australian-open-enters-metaverse-ditches-decenterland-for-roblox/?utm_source=24hrsupdateall">Australian Open Enters Metaverse, Ditches Decenterland For Roblox</a></p>
<p>The Russian authorities have been cracking on crypto companies as there were several transactions reported that breached the regulatory law of the U.S., European Union, and Great Britain which is against the trading policies with the Russian banks.</p>
<h2>NEXO Tweets To Take Stance</h2>
<p>NEXO has taken to its <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/Nexo/status/1613477462243147776" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter space</a> to give a clarification on the raid. In its tweet, they mention that the firm has turned down many businesses because they never compromise their values. They have always been a company that strictly follows anti-money laundering approach.</p>
<p>The firm also wrote that they have gone the “extra mile” to adhere to the regulations and provide a good value-based experience to the customers. They also pointed out that when the war broke out they raised money to help the victims. They went on to criticize the authorities saying that they have “adopted the kick first, ask questions later approach.”</p>

The online game is known as AO Adventure. In this game, players explore the Australian Open Park in a virtual setting that is based on the actual park in Melbourne.</p>
<p>Users will be greeted by a digital avatar known as &#8220;humanoid Nick&#8221; and given the opportunity to meet Australian tennis star Nick Kyrgios. The problem for <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blockchain</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/web-3-0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Web3</a></strong> fans is that Roblox&#8217;s platform is conspicuously devoid of any connections. On the online platform known as Roblox, users can design their own games that other people can play.</p>

<h2><b>Australian open choose Roblox over Decenterland</b></h2>
<p>The community will probably enjoy using Australian Open&#8217;s creations more as a result of their choice to use Roblox rather than only <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/decentraland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Decentraland</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Last year, the tournament used the <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/blog/top-decentraland-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Decentraland platform</a></strong> as its preferred medium. The platform was created by Web3 art studio Run It Wild, and according to information provided to Blockworks at the time, it reached a daily peak of 5,000 unique visitors.</p>
<p>The online event will continue to be co-hosted by Decentraland. However, now it is widely advertised on the Roblox platform from January 16 through January 29, local time. There will be many interactive games spread out throughout the park, including tennis (both singles and doubles) on Rod Laver Arena with human players, <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">artificial intelligence</a></strong>, or even friends and family.</p>
<h3><b>What exactly is AO Adventure?</b></h3>
<p>AO Adventure is a new interactive game created by Roblox. However, the Australian Open is in anticipation of the Grand Slam&#8217;s 2023 edition. The game features a variety of tennis-themed challenges and activities that are modeled after the real-life Melbourne Park precinct.</p>
<p>Users must first download the Roblox app in order to play AO Adventure. They will need to navigate to the Australian Open game once downloaded.</p>
<h3><b>Last year features NFT Artball</b></h3>
<p>At the 2022 Australian Open, there were 6776 collectible <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/investing-in-nfts-a-beginners-guide-to-the-risks-and-returns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFT</a></strong> &#8220;ArtBalls&#8221; that were uploaded to the blockchain. Also, linked to crucial shots in specific matches. At the time, the balls saw a biweekly trading volume of about $3.9 million.</p>
<p>With the release of 2454 newly minted NFT ArtBalls, the event hopes to recapture some of the excitement that surrounded last year&#8217;s trading activity.</p>

The move comes as Wall Street banks and crypto analysts expected inflation to have declined in December.</p>
<p>Bitcoin price <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-btc-gains-for-the-ninth-successive-day-is-20000-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">breakout above $18K</a> for the first time in the last 2 months. The 24-hour low and high are $17,337 and $18,268, respectively. Meanwhile, Ethereum also witnessed a 7% rally in the last 24 hours, hitting a high of $1,408.</p>
<h2>Crypto Market Rally to Continue After CPI Data?</h2>
<p>Popular analyst Michael van de Poppe in a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1613426838633697281" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweet</a> on January 12 shared his predictions for the crypto market as Wall Street economists expected a drop in the CPI.</p>
<p>As per consensus, the annual inflation rate in the U.S. likely slowed for a sixth straight month to 6.5% in December. It is the lowest since October 2021. The CPI also dropped to 7.1% in November.</p>
<p>Michael van de Poppe believes the CPI will most likely drop further, but the expectations of a massive drop as suggested by other experts are low. He expects the CPI can come in at 6.6% or 6.7%. Thereafter, the crypto market can witness a correction, before continuing the rally.</p>

<p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">On January 11, he shared that Bitcoin needed</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> to hold around $17.3K, which it did. Thus, Bitcoin &#8220;will likely continue moving higher toward $18.5K.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2>Wall Street Expectations on the Consumer Price Index</h2>
<p>Wall Street banks expected a drop in the CPI for December. Economists based their reasoning on the lower energy prices in December that contributed the most to the slowdown. Gasoline costs declined nearly 12% from November to December.</p>
<p>CIBC, Wells Fargo, and Nomura expect inflation at 6.3%, whereas Barclays, Bank of America, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs have set their expectations to 6.4%. Meanwhile, TD Securities, Citi, Credit Suisse, and BMO anticipate December&#8217;s CPI at 6.5%.</p>
