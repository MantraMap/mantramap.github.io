					<description><![CDATA[Farouk Fatih Özer, the former CEO of the now-defunct crypto exchange Thodex, has been sentenced to seven months in jail. The executive was convicted for failing to submit the required documents to Turkey&#8217;s tax board. Related Reading: This Under-The-Radar Coin Just Beat The Top 100 Cryptocurrencies With 120% Explosion Thodex, which was once a prominent crypto exchange in Turkey, experienced an abrupt closure, leading its CEO, Farouk Fatih Özer, to flee to Albania. However, after an Interpol Red Notice was issued, Özer was deported back to Turkey to be held accountable for the approximately $2 billion worth of cryptocurrencies belonging to investors. Özer, along with 21 other defendants, is embroiled in a protracted court case facing charges of alleged fraud, money laundering, and operating a criminal network through Thodex. Throughout the trial, Özer vehemently denied any wrongdoing and asserted that he was not the official representative of Thodex at the time, which made him unable to produce the requested books. Former CEO Of Thodex Claims To Have Been &#8220;Framed&#8221; In addition to the aforementioned charges, Özer is also facing accusations of defrauding Thodex investors and is currently awaiting a hearing to address these claims. Despite the allegations, the entrepreneur maintains his innocence and asserts that the defendants have framed him. During Özer&#8217;s first court appearance in June, he denied all charges and claimed to have been framed. He stated, &#8220;I started my company and my company was hacked,&#8221; addressing the court. The legal proceedings against Özer commenced after his failure to adhere to a notification issued on October 30, 2021. The notification requested the submission of documents pertaining to his business. Despite the notification, Özer did not provide the best  requested documents within the designated legal timeframe. Özer&#8217;s claim that a trustee had been assigned to oversee the company in his absence, he was unable to produce the required documents to the Tax Inspection Board. As a result, he was convicted. Initially, the prosecutor in Özer&#8217;s case requested a five-year prison sentence on charges of &#8220;smuggling&#8221; under the Tax Procedure Law. However, the court initially sentenced the crypto entrepreneur to one year and six months of imprisonment. It was subsequently reduced to seven months and 15 days. The reduction in sentences can be attributed to various factors. These included Özer&#8217;s social relations, as well as his overall behaviour and conduct throughout the trial.

					<description><![CDATA[Cathie Wood, the CEO of ARK Investment Management, has reaffirmed her bullish stance on Coinbase, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges, despite ARK&#8217;s recent sale of COIN stocks. Wood&#8217;s optimism comes in the wake of Ripple&#8217;s partial victory over the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on July 13. This ruling, while not entirely in favor of Ripple, has been viewed as a positive development for the broader crypto industry, particularly for crypto exchanges. Moreover, Wood&#8217;s confidence aligns with other experts who believe that this ruling could have significant implications for Coinbase and its ongoing legal battles with regulatory authorities. Ripple Court Ruling: A Boost for Crypto Exchanges and Coinbase The recent court ruling in favor of Ripple against the SEC has sparked reactions within the crypto industry. Cathie Wood, along with several industry pundits, has lauded the ruling, recognizing its potential positive impact on Coinbase and other exchanges. Related Reading: 29% Of Bitcoin’s Circulating Supply Is Now Presumed Lost Forever The court found that XRP tokens sold to retail investors on crypto exchanges were not securities, setting a precedent that could favor Coinbase and Binance in their legal disputes with the SEC. Wood, in a video posted on Bloomberg&#8217;s Twitter handle, emphasized that despite receiving a Wells notice in March and facing a lawsuit from the SEC in June, Coinbase&#8217;s share price demonstrated resilience, suggesting the robustness of its stock value. The CEO’s bullish comments come after ARK Investment Management recently sold a significant number of Coinbase shares, with three of its ETFs cashing in on the exchange&#8217;s rally. Despite these sales, Wood&#8217;s bullish outlook on Coinbase remains unshaken.  COIN price sitting at $106.75 &#124; Source: Coinbase Global, Inc. on TradingView.com The cryptocurrency exchange&#8217;s share price, which started the year at $33.60, has surged over 184%, reaching $105.55 at the time of publication. However, while industry players increasingly express optimism toward Coinbase, analysts from Berenberg Capital Markets caution that various regulatory challenges for crypto exchanges are yet to be fully resolved. Regulatory Concerns Linger Despite Coinbase&#8217;s Resilience Despite Coinbase&#8217;s strong performance and Wood&#8217;s optimism, regulatory uncertainties persist within the crypto exchange sector. Berenberg Capital Markets analysts highlight unresolved aspects of crypto exchange regulation, including concerns about Coinbase Earn, a product that offers yield on crypto staking.  The comments made by Judge Analisa Torres raise questions about the potential classification of Coinbase Earn as a security, signaling the need for further clarity in this area.  Related Reading: USDC Market Cap Drops As Redemptions Climb To $1.4 Billion Nevertheless, Wood&#8217;s continued bullish stance on Coinbase following the Ripple court ruling reflects her confidence in the exchange&#8217;s ability to navigate regulatory challenges successfully.  It is also crucial to acknowledge that the evolving regulatory landscape and ongoing legal battles with the SEC require careful monitoring. Achieving clarity and resolution in crypto exchange regulation remains essential to ensure the long-term stability and growth of the industry.

					<description><![CDATA[Data shows that Litecoin whales have deposited a large amount of the asset to exchanges during the past day, a sign that may be bearish for LTC. Litecoin Whales Have Made Significant Exchange Inflows In 24 Hours According to data from the cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert, several large transfers have taken place on the LTC blockchain during the past day. In total, there have been four such transactions, with the largest of them involving the movement of 500,000 LTC (around $46 million at the time the transfer went through). While the other three interestingly all saw the same number of tokens moving on the network: 78,760 LTC (the USD price fluctuated between each of these transactions, but on average, the stacks were worth $7.2 million at the time of movement). As all these transactions are so large, it&#8217;s possible that whale entities were behind them. The whales are generally influential beings in the market, as they hold very large amounts in their wallets. Thus, their movements are usually something to look out for, as they may precede volatility in the price. Naturally, how the price may be influenced by these humongous investors&#8217; transfers depends on what exactly they wanted to achieve with said transactions. Here are some additional details regarding the largest of today&#8217;s transfers, which may help shed some light on the context surrounding it: Looks like this LTC transfer required a negligible fee to go through &#124; Source: Whale Alert As you can see above, the sending address in the case of this Litecoin transfer was an unknown wallet, meaning that it was unattached to any known centralized platform. Such addresses are usually investors&#8217; personal wallets. The receiving address, on the other hand, was connected to a centralized platform: the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Transfers like this where coins move from self-custodial wallets to exchanges are called &#8220;exchange inflows.&#8221; Usually, one of the major reasons why holders may deposit their coins to exchanges is for selling-related purposes, so exchange inflows can have bearish effects on the price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Selling Again, Will Price Crash Again? It&#8217;s possible that the whale here also made this deposit with a similar intention. Naturally, if it&#8217;s truly the case, the price could feel visible negative effects from it, considering the scale of the transaction. As for the other three transactions that were all of the exact same scale, two of these transfers were inflows similar to this one, while the remaining one was an outflow. Two of these transfers (both inflows) shared the same sending and receiving addresses, making it likely that the same whale might have been behind the deposits. The outflow&#8217;s receiving address doesn&#8217;t match any of the transactions from today, so it&#8217;s unknown if it&#8217;s related to them. However, it involves the exact same number of coins as the two inflows, so it raises suspicion that the same whale entity may have been behind it after all. Related Reading: Stablecoin Exchange Deposits Remain Low, What Does It Mean For Bitcoin? In any case, one reality continues to stand: there were total net inflows of $53.2 million in the last 24 hours, which can act as a source of significant selling pressure in the market for the cryptocurrency.

					<description><![CDATA[XRP, the native token of the Ripple network, has reportedly surpassed Bitcoin in trading volume on the weekly average. The digital asset, following a significant legal win last week, now claims 21% of all cryptocurrency trade volume over the last week. This achievement is just one of many in Ripple&#8217;s recent journey in the spotlight. Ripple&#8217;s presence in the news lately owes to a landmark court decision in its favor. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had initially taken legal action against the firm, accusing it of selling unregistered securities. However, a federal judge in New York has recently declared that XRP is only security when sold directly to institutional investors under specific written contracts. And when the token was sold to retail investors on crypto exchanges, it is not deemed a security.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>XRP, the native token of the Ripple network, has <a href="https://twitter.com/KaikoData/status/1680865430741700608?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reportedly</a> surpassed Bitcoin in trading volume on the weekly average. The digital asset, following a significant legal win last week, now claims 21% of all cryptocurrency trade volume over the last week. This achievement is just one of many in Ripple&#8217;s recent journey in the spotlight.</p>
<p>Ripple&#8217;s presence in the news lately owes to a landmark <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.551082/gov.uscourts.nysd.551082.874.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">court decision</a> in its favor. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-338" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">initially</a> taken legal action against the firm, accusing it of selling unregistered securities.</p>
<p>However, a federal judge in New York has recently declared that XRP is only security when sold directly to institutional investors under specific written contracts. And when the token was sold to retail investors on crypto exchanges, it is not deemed a security.</p>
<p>This verdict led to major cryptocurrency exchanges relisting XRP, causing a subsequent surge in demand and trading volume.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Despite Bitcoin&#8217;s current struggle to surpass the $30,000 mark, data analytics firm Glassnode earlier today reported that the asset&#8217;s realized capitalization has since been on an upward trajectory, nearing the $400 billion mark. Bitcoin Realized Cap Nears $400 Billion According to Data analytics firm Glassnode, Bitcoin&#8217;s Realized Cap is now inching closer to $400 billion, showing that new capital is continuously entering the market despite the year&#8217;s ups and downs.  Related Reading: Standard Chartered Raises Bitcoin Forecast To $120,000, Citing Miners’ Reduced Selling Bitcoin&#8217;s Realized Cap represents the total value of all BTC at the price they were last moved or transacted, indicating the cost basis of holders. When this metric rises, it reveals that BTC is being traded at progressively higher prices, which suggests an increase in demand. Glassnode reported that the increase in BTC&#8217;s realized cap signals the consistent influx of capital into the asset throughout the year 2023. This steady inflow represents a stable investment climate surrounding Bitcoin, despite its recent price fluctuations. Furthermore, Glassnode&#8217;s assessment of the ascending realized cap is indicative of a broader trend in the cryptocurrency market. The data analytics firms said, &#8220;It signals that coins are changing hands at higher prices on net,&#8221; &#8211; a phenomenon that underlines a rising demand for Bitcoin. It is worth noting that this recorded increasing demand for Bitcoin comes at a time the asset might have flashed a hope of bullish moves following the surge in Spot Bitcoin ETF filings and financial giants such as BlackRock embracing the largest asset by market cap. BTC Struggles To Push Past $30,000 Meanwhile, as Bitcoin realized&#8217;s cap is approaching $400 billion, the asset has struggled to make a significant move above the $30,000 mark. Over the past 24 hours alone, the BTC price has traded both below and above the $30,000 mark, suggesting a level of consolidation at this point. Particularly, the asset currently has a 24-hour high of $30,292 and a 24-hour low of $29,792, at the time of writing. However, regardless of that, BTC is currently down by only a slight dip of 1% in the last 24 hours with a trading price of $29,882.  This latest price action follows Bitcoin&#8217;s quick spike which was seen last week on July 13. This surge brought Bitcoin price to trade even above the $31,000 mark before briefly slipping below $30,000. Over the past few days, however, a total of more than $30 billion has been removed from the BTC market cap.

					<description><![CDATA[After the launch of the mainnet on May 3, the SUI token fell into a deep downtrend, which has caused the price to drop by more than 87%. Low user numbers and poor on-chain data have severely clouded the outlook. However, a few days ago, there was a surprise that gave a big boost to the SUI price. The SUI network made waves in the crypto space by surpassing its competitor Solana in daily transactions. However, with a sudden record of 29 million transactions in 24 hours, SUI has left many crypto enthusiasts questioning the validity and sustainability of this sudden surge. Renowned analyst and crypto whale Andrew Kang, known for his insightful commentary, has raised concerns about the authenticity of these transactions, suggesting that SUI may be artificially inflating its numbers. Kang writes today: Sui pumping their numbers up. Chart looks good, market does not seem to be discerning about validity of transactions. Fake it til you make it. Is SUI Still Worth Buying? As Kang argues, the question is: Are the numbers legitimate and can drive a sustainable upward trend, or will the hype quickly die down because of fake numbers? Related Reading: SUI Continues Rally As Sui 8192 Web3 Game Fuels Blockchain Activity To Hit New Peak The recent surge in transactions can be primarily attributed to the introduction of the on-chain game, &#8220;Sui 8192.&#8221; Developed by the team behind the wallet provider, Ethos Wallet, this casual game has captured the attention of users with its gameplay reminiscent of the classic puzzle game &#8220;2048.&#8221; Each move within the game triggers a transaction, resulting in the state of the game being recorded on the blockchain. With the integration of a pre-approval mechanism in Ethos Wallet, players can optimize their gameplay experience by setting a token amount before each game. It&#8217;s Important to know that the SUI Foundation has allocated $5 million to further stimulate activity within the game, offering players the opportunity to earn rewards in the form of SUI tokens by competing against others or completing tasks. However, this could call into question the sustainability of this increase in transaction activity. Related Reading: Sui Foundation Refutes Claims Of Dumping Locked Staking Rewards On Binance Perhaps the game is only experiencing a short hype at the moment because players want to grab the free tokens. Once the marketing budget is exhausted, the hype could quickly be over. SUI traders and investors should therefore be cautious. Prior to this transaction surge, the project had been marred by negative headlines, including allegations of suspicious token movements, concerns about venture capital influence, and opaque tokenomics. These controversies have left some investors wary of the project&#8217;s long-term prospects. Price Analysis However, as stated by Kang, the SUI chart looks promising at the moment. The price has broken out of the downward trend that existed since the mainnet launch. The bulls also managed to defend the 23.6 Fibonacci retracement level in a retest. Currently, the price is contending with the 38.2% retracement level at $0.76. If it manages to break above this resistance, $0.84 and $0.92 could be the next price target.

					<description><![CDATA[The Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), designed for building cross-chain applications and services, has now launched for early access users on the Avalanche, Ethereum, Optimism, and Polygon blockchains. On July 20, the Chainlink protocol will become available to developers across the four blockchains’ testnets and also Arbitrum’s Goerli. As a result of this, the price of Chainlink’s native token, LINK, rallied nearly 10% to touch $7.30 following this announcement on Monday. Chainlink&#8217;s CCIP &#8211; The Future Of Interoperability? In a blog post dated July 17, Chainlink announced the launch of the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol to early access users on Avalanche, Ethereum, Optimism, and Polygon blockchains. While DeFi lending protocol Aave is set to integrate the protocol, it has already been adopted on the derivatives platform Synthetix.

It also offers &#8220;Simplified Token Transfers&#8221;, which allows protocols to swiftly send tokens across chains through audited token pool contracts.   Chainlink claims that CCIP is a blockchain layer designed to foster a connection between enterprises and any public or private blockchain ecosystem. The cross-chain protocol is a collaborative effort with Swift, the renowned global financial messaging network. It leverages Swift&#8217;s messaging infrastructure to facilitate token transfers across various public and private blockchains. According to Chainlink’s co-founder Sergey Nazarov, CCIP is a solution that aims to “connect the fragmented public blockchain landscape and the growing bank ecosystem into a single Internet of Contracts.” He also stated that such technology will be crucial to developing and maintaining a blockchain-powered society. Just like key standards such as TCP/IP remade a fragmented early internet into the single global internet we all know and use today, we are making CCIP to connect the fragmented public blockchain landscape and the growing bank chain ecosystem into a single Internet of Contracts.… https://t.co/BDMFMfknY2 pic.twitter.com/DDscglD2An — Sergey Nazarov (@SergeyNazarov) July 17, 2023 Some of the financial institutions and enterprises also exploring the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol include Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ), BNP Paribas, BNY Mellon, Citi, Euroclear, and Lloyds Banking Group. Chainlink (LINK) Up By 35% In One Month &#8211; Price Overview Following the announcement of the CCIP launch, the price of LINK experienced a significant pump, recording an almost 10% increase in the early hours of Tuesday.

					<description><![CDATA[Over the last week, the XRP token has dominated the headlines following Ripple’s partial court victory over the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  On July 13, Judge Analisa Torres of the US District Court of the Southern District of New York ruled that XRP doesn&#8217;t qualify as a security leading to a massive price surge in which the token gained by almost 90%. However, while it may appear that XRP&#8217;s positive effect on the market is waning, with most assets slipping into a bearish state, there is still a high level of interest surrounding this altcoin, proven by a recent report from prominent crypto exchange Bitrue. Bitrue Users Accumulate $800M Worth Of XRP In Futures Market.  In the late hours of yesterday, a crypto analyst with the Twitter handle @cowboycrypto313 revealed that Bitrue had shared a report via email with its users, noting a massive increase in the notional value of the open interest of the XRP token. Related Reading: XRP Price Retreats After Massive 80% Rally, Buy The Dips? The notional value of open interest refers to the total value of outstanding contracts in a futures or optional market. In this context, it represents the total value of XRP on the Bitrue exchange based on what its traders have pledged to buy or sell in the future.  In this report, Bitrue states that XRP holdings in its Futures service spiked from less than $200 million to over $800 million during the weekend. Interestingly, the exchange further revealed that 88% of its users are holding a long position on this asset. According to a chart shared by Bitrue, the notional value of open interest for XRP on its platform had been below $200 million for the majority of the last two weeks. However, following the court ruling on July 13, this index started rising, with the XRP Futures market recording a notable spike on July 16.  Source: Twitter XRP Soars By 57% In Seven Days In other news, XRP remains the center of the crypto market attention, recording a 56.73% gain in the last week, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Currently, XRP, which now ranks as the fourth-biggest cryptocurrency, is tagged biggest weekly gainer. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that this token has shown little to no price movement in the last few days, with its price hovering around the $0.74 region. As of this writing, XRP is trading at $0.742 with a 1.14% gain on the last day.  Related Reading: BTC Price Analysis: Why Is Bitcoin Down Today?

					<description><![CDATA[The Bitcoin price has fallen to the lower end of its almost one-month trading range between $29,800 and $31,300. Already yesterday, BTC briefly fell to as low as $29,704, only to recover to $30,306 within a few hours. At press time, BTC was again moving towards the $30,000 mark, and another fall and liquidity grab seems likely. While this week the macro data releases are pretty quiet, it&#8217;s worth taking a look at what&#8217;s happening in the Bitcoin market itself. Why Is Bitcoin Down Today? Swissblock Insights observed a peculiar calm in the market when Bitcoin reached a new yearly high of $31.840 last week.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Bitcoin price has fallen to the lower end of its almost one-month trading range between $29,800 and $31,300.

At press time, BTC was again moving towards the $30,000 mark, and another fall and liquidity grab seems likely.</p>
