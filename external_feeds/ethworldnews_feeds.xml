<ul><li>Crypto exchange Bittrex has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the state of Delaware.&nbsp;</li><li>The U.S. Treasury Department’s OFAC is listed as the bankrupt exchange’s largest creditor.&nbsp;</li><li>The bankruptcy filing comes less than a month after the crypto exchange was sued by the U.S. SEC.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Bittrex Inc. has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the state of Delaware. The Seattle-based crypto exchange’s bankruptcy filing comes less than a month after it was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The exchange announced last month that it was winding down operations in the United States in light of the deteriorating regulatory landscape.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Bittrex Owes $25 Million To Treasury Department’s OFAC</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-08/crypto-platform-bittrex-files-chapter-11-bankruptcy-in-delaware?leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, Bittrex’s Chapter 11 filing listed assets and liabilities reaching up to $1 billion each. Court papers viewed by Bloomberg revealed that the crypto exchange’s affiliated entities including Desolation Holdings LLC, Bittrex Malta Holdings Ltd., and Bittrex Malta Ltd also filed for bankruptcy.  The exchange has clarified that the operations of Bittrex Global will not be impacted by its American entity&#8217;s bankruptcy. As for customer assets, the exchange assured its users that their funds are safe and secure on the platform. </p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The #1 creditor in Bittrex&#39;s Chapter 11 is the OFAC department who they agreed to pay $25m as a settlement for violating Sanctions/AML🌲 <a href="https://t.co/UgukJUx5w0" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/UgukJUx5w0</a> <a href="https://t.co/GyMwOhdMiV" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/GyMwOhdMiV</a></p>&mdash; Tree of Alpha (@Tree_of_Alpha) <a href="https://twitter.com/Tree_of_Alpha/status/1655684740811194371?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">May 8, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>This announcement does not impact Bittrex Global, which will continue operations as normal for its customers outside the U.S.&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p>Ironically, the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is listed as the bankrupt exchange’s largest non-insider creditor. Bittrex owed a whopping $25 million to OFAC as part of a settlement both parties reached in October last year. OFAC imposed the multi-million fine on the crypto exchange over alleged violations of multiple sanctions programs as well as the Bank Secrecy Act’s (BSA’s) anti-money laundering (AML) and suspicious activity report (SAR) reporting requirements. At the time, the enforcement action on the exchange was OFAC’s largest ever. </p>



<p>Bittrex’s bankruptcy filing comes less than a month after it was <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-sues-bittrex-violation-federal-laws/">sued</a> by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over alleged violations of federal laws. The securities regulator charged the exchange and its former CEO Bill Shihara, with operating an unregistered national securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency. The regulator also charges its foreign affiliate with failing to register as a national securities exchange in connection with its operation of a single shared order book along with the American entity.</p>

<ul><li>Paxful has announced the resumption of operations after being suspended for over a month.&nbsp;</li><li>The P2P crypto platform suspended operations last month following the departure of key staff members.&nbsp;</li><li>The Paxful wallet remained active throughout the platform’s suspension period.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Paxful has announced that it is resuming operations after being offline for more than a month. The P2P bitcoin exchange shut down operations last month following the departure of key staff members and increasing scrutiny from regulators in the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Conflict Among Paxful’s Top Management </strong>Continues</h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://paxful.com/sign-up-transition" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a> from Paxful earlier today, the peer-to-peer Bitcoin marketplace is now back online. Over the next two days, the platform will gradually restore functionality to the marketplace. The platform took to Twitter earlier today to inform its community that it is back and is “better than ever”. Its staff has reportedly been working for the past month to bring the marketplace back online without compromising the safety and security of users. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We know it has been a difficult time for many of our users, who were understandably surprised by the sudden suspension, however, we are delighted to be back so that we can continue to serve millions of people without financial access.”</p></blockquote>



<p>News of the resumption of services comes as a positive development for its users. The exchange <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/paxful-shutting-down-amid-regulatory-challanges/">suspended </a>operations on April 4, 2023, amid growing scrutiny by American regulators and the departure of the company’s key staff members including Paxful co-founder Artur Schabeck. Paxful Wallet remained fully operational throughout the suspension period. Its users were also offered multiple P2P crypto avenues to continue trading. </p>



<p>Schabeck told <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/05/08/paxful-marketplace-back-online-following-temporary-suspension/" rel="nofollow noopener">CoinDesk </a>earlier today that he is actively looking for a settlement with Paxful in relation to the wrongful termination lawsuit he filed following his departure from the firm. The former executive further revealed that the P2P firm is owned by a custodian who serves as one of the company’s three directors. The third board member plays an instrumental role, given his power to act as a tiebreaker in a conflict involving the other founders.</p>

<p>The Banque du Canada (Bank of Canada) is considering issuing its own central bank digital currency (<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/swift-moves-to-second-phase-cbdc-testing/">CBDC</a>) to keep up with the growing adoption of crypto assets around the world. The central bank has invited public feedback to determine the features that could be integrated into a digital Canadian dollar. </p>



<h2><strong>CBDC Issuance Will Have No Impact On Bank Notes</strong></h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2023/05/bank-canada-launches-public-consultations-digital-dollar/" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> earlier today, the Bank of Canada announced that it was launching public consultations on a digital Canadian dollar to explore the design and use cases of a potential CBDC. The consultation opened today and will remain open for public participation until June 19, 2023. The central bank revealed that it was exploring a digital version of the country’s national currency, citing the rapidly evolving payments space around the world. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>As Canada’s central bank, we want to make sure everyone can always take part in our country’s economy. That means being ready for whatever the future holds.” </p><cite>Carolyn Rogers, Senior Deputy Governor, Banque du Canada</cite></blockquote>



<p>The Canadian central bank acknowledged the growing adoption of private cryptocurrencies and central bank digital currencies and the possibility that they may become a popular mode of payment in Canada soon. In order to maintain the status quo and avoid compromising the Canadian dollar’s role as the official and centrally issued currency, the Bank of Canada is considering offering a digital alternative to its citizens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the central bank, a CBDC would ensure that every citizen takes part in the economy. That being said, the Bank of Canada noted the role of banknotes as a safe, accessible, and trusted method of payment. To that end, the bank stated that it would continue offering bank notes to those who prefer them over CBDCs in the future. “Cash isn’t going anywhere,” the central bank added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>

<p>A Coinbase executive team and its CEO Brian Armstrong are in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to engage local regulators on crypto policies as the company expands to offshore jurisdictions. </p>



<p>The visit to the UAE, particularly to meet with policymakers in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, comes amid souring relations with regulators like the U.S. Securities and Exchange, and effort to establish operations outside America&#8217;s borders. </p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The UAE 🇦🇪 deserves a lot of credit for being forward thinking on crypto. First dedicated crypto regulator in the world, a clear rule book published (!), business friendly plus strong customer protections.

<h2>Dubai&#8217;s Crypto Allure</h2>



<p>In March of 2022, the UAE Prime Minister declared his intention to establish the UAE as a key player in the future of crypto. The region&#8217;s crypto ecosystem has since gained significant growth, welcoming industry players like Binance and Kraken. </p>



<p>Last year, Dubai&#8217;s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority was formed to issue a crypto regulatory framework, laying out a concrete licensing regime for crypto service providers. Last month, the registration authority of ADGM issued a consultation paper to explain the proposed Distributed Ledger Technology Foundations Regulations 2023.   </p>



<h2>Coinbase&#8217;s UAE Strategy</h2>



<p>Armstrong <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/the-uae-recognising-the-transformative-potential-of-the-cryptoeconomy" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/the-uae-recognising-the-transformative-potential-of-the-cryptoeconomy" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">admired</a> the UAE for its proactive and progressive regulatory approach to crypto in a tweet, saying the region &#8220;deserves a lot of credit for being forward thinking on crypto&#8221;. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>‘There is no doubt that UAE has the potential to be a strategic hub for Coinbase, amplifying our efforts across the world, and this week we are delighted to be on the ground in Dubai and Abu Dhabi meeting key local stakeholders and commending in person the role they have played in creating such a welcoming environment.</p></blockquote>



<p>CEO Armstrong will provide a keynote address at the inaugural Dubai Fintech Summit while Coinbase is also working with Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) regulators to further expand the licensing and availability for Coinbase International Exchange.</p>



<p>Coinbase has also been engaging with Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), a dedicated regulator for virtual assets, as they put forward a comprehensive retail framework built on the principles of economic sustainability and cross-border financial security.  &#8220;This expands our global footprint, helping get us closer to bringing 1 billion users to crypto,&#8221; Brain said.  </p>



<p>When asked to comment on the regulatory <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-reply-coinbase-petition-in-10-days/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-reply-coinbase-petition-in-10-days/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clampdown</a> from the U.S., the exchange’s CEO said Coinbase is &#8220;100% committed to the U.S.&#8221; </p>

<p>According to on-chain data, BTC transaction fees reached as high as $19.21, a two-year high. The cost of sending a transaction on BTC&#8217;s blockchain has not climbed so high since April 2021 when fees skyrocketed to $62. </p>

<h2>Ordinals Drive Bitcoin Network Congestion</h2>



<p>The Ordinals protocol introduced by developer Casey Rodarmor in January 2023 allows users to inscribe data on every satoshi, the smallest BTC unit. This incentivized users to experiment with fungible token standards and non-fungible tokens also known as NFTs.</p>



<p>Data from Dune Analytics indicated that over 3 million NFTs have been issued on BTC&#8217;s blockchain since Ordinals debuted. The majority of these NFTs are text-based and created through a process called &#8216;inscription&#8217;. </p>



<p>Shortly after Rodarmor unveiled the Ordinals protocol, a developer known by the pseudonym Domo leveraged the protocol to build the ‘Bitcoin Request for Comment’ (BRC-20) token standard. BRC-20 allows transferable assets on BTC&#8217;s blockchain allowing users to issue and trade tokens on crypto&#8217;s largest network by market cap.</p>



<p>Indeed, it seems the BRC-20 token standard has breathed new life into BTC&#8217;s blockchain as over 11,000 tokens have been issued using Domo&#8217;s standard. OrdSpace data showed tokens created under BRC-2O boast almost $1 billion in combined market cap. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="526" src="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-129-1024x526.png" alt="Bitcoin Fees Hit 2-Year High As BRC-20 Tokens Gain Steam 8" class="wp-image-582132" srcset="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-129-1024x526.png 1024w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-129-300x154.png 300w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-129-770x396.png 770w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-129-269x138.png 269w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-129-746x384.png 746w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-129.png 1204w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Bitcoin Fees Hit 2-Year High As BRC-20 Tokens Gain Steam 11"><figcaption><strong><a href="https://ordspace.org/brc20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://ordspace.org/brc20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BRC-20 Tokens by OrdSpace</a></strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>ORDI, believed to be the first BRC-20 token and native token of Ordinals marketplace, leads the pack with over $220 million in marketcap and more than 7,000 unique holders. BRC-20 also opened up BTC&#8217;s blockchain to memecoin hysteria as tokens like Pepe, VMPX, and Meme garnered hundreds of millions in daily trading volume. </p>



<p>Notably, the Pepe token on BTC&#8217;s network is not to be confused with the Pepe memecoin issued on Ethereum. </p>



<p>Crypto commentators and BTC Maxis suggested that Ordinals beckons a new era for BTC and its network, beefing up utility and propelling network activity. The extra network demand also affected a major crypto exchange. </p>



<p>Binance paused BTC withdrawals twice on Sunday before <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-resumes-bitcoin-withdrawal-halt/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-resumes-bitcoin-withdrawal-halt/" rel="noreferrer noopener">resuming</a> normal operations and mulling plans of integrating the Lightning Network, a layer 2 scaling solution built atop the BTC mainnet. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The Aave DAO completely voted in support of a proposal to launch the third iteration of its lending service on Metis, an L2 scaling network built atop Ethereum&#8217;s blockchain.</li><li>Launching on Metis will allow users of the popular DeFi lender to access lower transaction fees and enjoy liquidity incentives offered by Metis.</li><li>The move could bootstrap activity on Metis and drive adoption on the L2 amid growing competition in Ethereum&#8217;s scaling protocol landscape.</li></ul>



<p>Ethereum L2 scaling network Metis will welcome DeFi lending protocol Aave to its ecosystem after a community voted in support of the move. Indeed, members of the Aave DAO community backed deploying the lenders&#8217; third iteration or version 3 service on Metis. </p>



<p>The proposal <a href="https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=212" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=212" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">opened</a> for voting on May 2 and concluded last Friday. Not a single voter or community member opposed the move, signaling total support for deploying V3 on Metis. </p>



<p>Aave&#8217;s launch on the Ethereum L2 network beckons fresh rewards for Metis users who borrow and lend digital assets via the decentralized finance service. The move could also galvanize activity on Metis as the protocol competes with other scaling networks like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon. </p>



<p>While the last bull run propelled Metis to the limelight, the network&#8217;s adoption has suffered blows amid market downturns and increased market competition. Metis boasts cheaper gas fees compared to Ethereum, giving users a more cost-effective alternative without giving up transaction security. Providing cheaper transaction costs is usually a common offering from L2 networks. </p>



<p>In a bid to encourage adoption and leverage Aave&#8217;s V3 launch, Metis will offer liquidity incentives to users. Liquidity miners will receive 100,000 METIS coins within a 6-month timeline after deployment. Also, 4,000 METIS tokens will be distributed to token miners as part of a reward program. </p>

<h2>Aave Fuels Expansion Campaign</h2>



<p>The DeFi lender seems on a mission to expand beyond Ethereum&#8217;s base layer with a dearth of governance proposals. In April, the governance DAO <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/aave-v3-lending-bnb-chain-uniswap-polygon/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/aave-v3-lending-bnb-chain-uniswap-polygon/" rel="noreferrer noopener">voted</a> to launch V3 on BNB Chain, a major liquidity hub for decentralized finance users. The move was announced shortly after leading decentralized exchange Uniswap moved to launch on the Binance blockchain. </p>



<p>Aave DAO also voted to <a href="http://The move could bootstrap activity on Metis and drive adoption on the L2 amid growing competition in Ethereum&#039;s scaling protocol landscape" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">remove</a> BUSD from lending markets on Ethereum. The proposal argued that regulatory actions against stablecoin issuer Paxos and the token&#8217;s declining supply greatly diminishes BUSD&#8217;s utility. </p>

<ul><li>Binance has resumed Bitcoin withdrawals on its trading platform.&nbsp;</li><li>The exchange suspended withdrawals earlier today, citing congestion in the Bitcoin network.&nbsp;</li><li>Binance’s Bitcoin wallets have seen outflows of more than 157,000 BTC over the past 24 hours.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Binance has resumed Bitcoin withdrawals on its platform almost two hours after the exchange suspended BTC withdrawals for its customers. The world’s largest crypto exchange cited congestion in the Bitcoin network earlier today as it paused Bitcoin withdrawals. </p>



<h2><strong>Binance Cold Wallets Sees Outflow Of Over 157,000 BTC</strong></h2>



<p>Binance took to <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1655227965062672384" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a> earlier today to inform its customers that they wouldn’t be able to withdraw their BTC from the trading platform after congestion in the Bitcoin network forced the crypto exchange to suspend BTC withdrawals. The tweet assured customers that their funds were safe on the platform and that a team was “working on a fix” in the meantime. Nearly two hours after the Bitcoin withdrawals were paused, the exchange announced that the issues had been resolved and that the withdrawals had been resumed. </p>



<p>The whole episode invited considerable criticism from crypto Twitter, with influencers, on-chain analysts, and platform users lining up to question the exchange’s decision to suspend withdrawals. According to on-chain data gathered by <a href="https://twitter.com/IT_Tech_PL/status/1655250842369269761" rel="nofollow noopener">CryptoQuant</a>, Binance’s Bitcoin balance saw significant changes earlier today. The exchange transferred a whopping 117,359 BTC from its cold wallet to a market wallet, followed by another out-transfer of 40,184 BTC, bringing the total outflow over the past 24 hours to more than 157,000 BTC ($4.55 billion). </p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What fix could Binance possibly have for this issue? Network congestion is not something that can be solved by Binance, so why would they pretend they can? <a href="https://t.co/qKUY9gkPi1" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/qKUY9gkPi1</a></p>&mdash; Bennett Tomlin (@BennettTomlin) <a href="https://twitter.com/BennettTomlin/status/1655257927219924998?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">May 7, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The timing of the BTC withdrawal suspension by <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-doj-probe-russian-sanction/">Binance</a> was brought into question by crypto Twitter, given that it was enforced on the same day that the crypto exchange moved billions worth of BTC. One user pointed out that the Bitcoins were more from the exchange’s cold wallets to its market wallet after the BTC supply from the latter ran out. Binance has provided no clarification on the BTC transfers. </p>

<ul><li>The U.S. Justice Department is reportedly probing Binance for potential violation of sanctions imposed on Russia. </li><li>The DoJ’s national security division is investigating the exchange’s officials to determine if sanctions were evaded. </li><li>The exchange is already facing a criminal investigation over alleged illegal activities including money laundering. </li></ul>



<p>The United States Department of Justice is reportedly probing the world’s largest crypto exchange for potential violation of sanctions imposed on Russia in light of the conflict in Ukraine. The purpose of the investigation is to determine if Binance Holdings Ltd. was illegally used to allow Russians to evade U.S. sanctions and move money through the crypto platform.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Binance Officials Under Scrutiny By DoJ</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-05/binance-faces-us-probe-of-possible-russian-sanctions-violations#xj4y7vzkg?leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, the Justice Department’s national security division is investigating Binance to see if the crypto exchange complied with the sanctions imposed on Russia following the invasion of Ukraine. Five people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg that the exchange’s officials are under scrutiny as part of the ongoing probe into the company’s conduct. </p>



<p>While the Justice Department declined to comment on the ongoing investigation, Binance told Bloomberg that the company was in full compliance with all U.S. and international financial sanctions. The exchange added that it has enforced industry leading know your customer (KYC) protocols in addition to a zero-tolerance policy for double registrations, anonymous identities, and obscure sources of money.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>In 2021, Binance launched an initiative to completely overhaul its corporate governance structure, including bringing in a world-class bench of seasoned executives to fundamentally change how Binance operates globally.” </p><cite>statement from Binance</cite></blockquote>



<p>A person close to the investigation revealed that as of now there is no indication that the Department of Justice is preparing to agree to a settlement with the crypto exchange. However, not all probes lead to the filing of formal charges. The latest probe adds to an existing criminal and regulatory investigation into the exchange over its conduct. The news comes barely a day after Reuters <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-reuters-accounts-terrorism-link/">reported</a> that the exchange was entertaining accounts with links to terrorist organizations, including the Islamic State. </p>

<p>The world’s largest crypto exchange has taken issue with a recent report published by Reuters.

<h2><strong>Binance: Reuters Is Deliberately Leaving Out Critical Facts</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-seized-binance-crypto-accounts-thwart-islamic-state-document-shows-2023-05-04/" rel="nofollow noopener">Reuters</a> published a report on May 4, 2023, which revealed that Israel’s National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing (NBCTF) had confiscated two Binance accounts in January this year. As per documents on NBCTF’s official website, the accounts were affiliated with the Islamic State and were seized to “thwart the activity” of the Islamic State and prevent it from furthering its terror-related goals. Reuters further reported that the Israeli agency had seized around 190 Binance accounts since 2021, dozens of which were owned by Palestinian firms linked to the Islamist Hamas group.</p>



<p>According to Reuters, almost all of the 190 accounts seized by Israeli authorities since 2021 were owned by three currency exchange outfits based in Palestine. All three have reportedly been designated as terrorist organizations by Israel due to their role in transferring funds by the Hamas group. Al Mutahadun For Exchange, Dubai Company for Exchange, and Al Wefaq Co. For Exchange, the three Palestinian firms were reportedly behind more than 80 Binance accounts that held over $137,000.</p>



<p>In response to the Reuters article, Binance shared its side of the case in a <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/community/our-response-to-reuters-1363137884256691497" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a> earlier today. The crypto exchange accused Reuters of “deliberately leaving out critical facts to fit their narrative.” The firm took particular issue with the allegations made against its compliance team, which reportedly consists of 750 members with backgrounds in regulatory agencies and law enforcement. </p>



<p>Binance claimed that no other crypto exchange or financial institution did more to keep bad actors away and restrict unethical conduct. The exchange argued that criminal enterprises don’t register on the platform using their real identities which makes it difficult to root them out.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Almost half of our compliance team are involved in sanctions control work such as anti-money laundering, name screening, Know Your Customer (KYC) onboarding, and on-chain monitoring.&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p>The crypto exchange stated that it was constantly working with law enforcement agencies around the world to make the platform safer and limit the access of bad actors. To make its case for legal compliance, the exchange revealed that it had already facilitated the seizure of more than $1 billion following requests by law enforcement agencies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Do Kwon could face 40 years in prison if prosecuted and found guilty by a court in his home country of South Korea.</li><li>Media reports confirmed that authorities in South Korea and the United States are contending over extradition rights after Montenegrin police arrested the Terraform Labs founder.</li><li>An investigator who has led the probe into how Terraform Labs collapsed opined that prosecuting Kwon in South Korea is &#8220;more efficient&#8221;.</li></ul>



<p>Media reports <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/south-korean-prosecutor-calls-for-crypto-entrepreneur-do-kwon-to-face-charges-in-home-country-639f5515" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.wsj.com/articles/south-korean-prosecutor-calls-for-crypto-entrepreneur-do-kwon-to-face-charges-in-home-country-639f5515" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that authorities in South Korea and the United States are contending for the right to extradite Do Kwon after Montenegrin police arrested the Terraform Labs founder in March.</p>



<p>Kwon&#8217;s extradition has been a talking point since his <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/terra-do-kwon-arrested-montenegro/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/terra-do-kwon-arrested-montenegro/" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrest in March</a>. Montenegrin police seized the fugitive as he attempted to fly to Dubai using fake travel papers. U.S. authorities hope to prosecute the former Terraform investor for defrauding American investors who held LUNA and UST, two tokens designed by the founder and other employees. </p>



<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission already <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwons-lawyers-sec-lawsuit-dismissed/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwons-lawyers-sec-lawsuit-dismissed/" rel="noreferrer noopener">charged</a> Kwon with fraud and violations of securities laws though he tried to <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/judge-sec-dig-do-kwon-terra-and-lfg-files/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/judge-sec-dig-do-kwon-terra-and-lfg-files/" rel="noreferrer noopener">slow down regulators with a court motion</a>.</p>



<h2>Best Jurisdiction To Prosecute Do Kwon</h2>



<p>Dan Sung-han who led South Korean efforts to uncover the factors behind Terra&#8217;s collapse, believes extraditing him to his native country would be the &#8220;more efficient&#8221; way to prosecute Do Kwon and deliver justice to Terra&#8217;s victims who lost at least $40 billion last May. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Given the nature of this incident, we think investigating the case in South Korea would be the most efficient way of bringing justice. We’ve collected a large swath of evidence pertaining to the TerraUSD case overall, much of which is information that cannot be easily obtained in the U.S.</p></blockquote>



<p>&#8220;I believe the U.S. is willing to cooperate&#8221;, the South Korean investigator said, speaking to America&#8217;s request for Do Kwon&#8217;s extradition. </p>



<p>Montenegrin Prime Minister Dritan Abazovic said, &#8220;We are ready to make the extradition to the country which is looking for him&#8221;.</p>
