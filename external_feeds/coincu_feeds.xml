<p>Arbitrum Nova is gaining recognition as a promising Layer 2 solution that addresses Ethereum&#8217;s scalability challenges. By integrating with Arbitrum Nova, Hop enables users to easily transfer assets between Ethereum and other supported blockchains, enhancing cross-chain liquidity and accessibility.</p>



<p>With the launch of the integration, Hp has made two tokens available for transfer on Arbitrum Nova: Ethereum ($ETH) and Magic Internet Gathering of Cryptocats ($MAGIC). This means that users can now bridge these tokens across chains with increased efficiency and reduced fees.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-937.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="488" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-937-1024x488.png" alt="Hop Protocol Integrates with Arbitrum Nova For $ETH And $MAGIC" class="wp-image-202776" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-937-1024x488.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-937-300x143.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-937-768x366.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-937-750x357.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-937.png 1066w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Hop Protocol Integrates with Arbitrum Nova For $ETH And $MAGIC 2"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The addition of $ETH and $MAGIC to Hop&#8217;s supported tokens opens up new possibilities for users looking to leverage the benefits of Arbitrum Nova. The integration streamlines the process of moving these tokens between Ethereum and other compatible networks, providing enhanced transaction speed and cost-effectiveness.</p>



<p>Hop&#8217;s commitment to improving cross-chain interoperability aligns perfectly with Arbitrum Nova&#8217;s mission to scale Ethereum and enable a seamless user experience. By expanding its support for these tokens, Hop is facilitating broader access to the benefits of Layer 2 solutions, offering users increased efficiency and lower transaction costs.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-938.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="360" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-938.png" alt="Hop Protocol Integrates with Arbitrum Nova For $ETH And $MAGIC" class="wp-image-202777" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-938.png 680w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-938-300x159.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" title="Hop Protocol Integrates with Arbitrum Nova For $ETH And $MAGIC 3"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>As the Ethereum ecosystem continues to evolve, the integration of protocols like HP and Arbitrum Nova plays a vital role in unlocking the full potential of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This collaboration highlights the ongoing efforts to address the scalability limitations of Ethereum, making it more accessible and user-friendly.</p>

<p><strong>Key points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Celsius Network founder Alex Mashinsky pleads not guilty to fraud charges amid allegations of misleading customers and token value manipulation.</em></li>



<li><em>Mashinsky faces multiple criminal counts while regulatory agencies file lawsuits against him and Celsius Network.</em></li>



<li><em>Legal actions add to the ongoing scrutiny and challenges faced by the cryptocurrency industry.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us-sec-sues-celsius-network-its-founder-2023-07-13/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reuters</a></em>, Alex Mashinsky, the founder and former CEO of bankrupt cryptocurrency lender Celsius Network, entered a plea of not guilty on Thursday in relation to fraud charges filed against him. The charges include securities fraud, commodities fraud, and wire fraud.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-933.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-933-1024x682.png" alt="Celsius Network Founder Pleads Not Guilty As Fraud Charges Mount In Multi-Billion Dollar" class="wp-image-202753" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-933-1024x682.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-933-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-933-768x511.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-933-750x499.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-933-1140x759.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-933.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Celsius Network Founder Pleads Not Guilty As Fraud Charges Mount In Multi-Billion Dollar 7"></a></figure></div>


<p>The indictment also accuses Mashinsky of misleading customers and artificially inflating the value of Celsius Network&#8217;s proprietary token. Alongside the criminal charges, several federal regulatory agencies have filed lawsuits against Mashinsky and Celsius Network.</p>



<p>The legal action against <a href="https://coincu.com/202559-former-ceo-of-celsius-network-arrested/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mashinsky</a> is the latest blow to the cryptocurrency industry, which has been grappling with the fallout from a decline in crypto prices that led to the collapse of several companies. Other prominent figures in the industry, including Sam Bankman-Fried of FTX, have also faced charges of fraud.</p>



<p>He appeared in federal court in Manhattan for his arraignment and was released on a $40 million bond secured by his residence in Manhattan.</p>



<p>Celsius Network, founded in 2017, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July 2022 following customer withdrawals as crypto prices plummeted. Many customers have faced difficulties accessing their funds.</p>

<p>The company&#8217;s collapse is part of a series of bankruptcies within the cryptocurrency sector as token prices declined due to rising interest rates and persistent inflation. Other companies, such as Three Arrows Capital and Voyager Digital, also filed for bankruptcy around the same time as Celsius Network.</p>



<p>In addition to the criminal charges, Mashinsky and Celsius Network&#8217;s former chief revenue officer, Roni Cohen-Pavon, were charged with market manipulation of the company&#8217;s token and fraudulent schemes related to the manipulation of the token&#8217;s price.</p>



<p>Alongside the criminal charges, regulatory agencies, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), have filed lawsuits against Mashinsky and Celsius Network. The SEC alleges that Mashinsky and the company raised billions of dollars through the sale of unregistered crypto securities and provided misleading information about the company&#8217;s financial state. The SEC claims that Celsius Network falsely presented itself as safe while engaging in risky practices and making uncollateralized loans.</p>



<p>The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Federal Trade Commission have also filed lawsuits against Celsius Network and Mashinsky. The FTC has reached a settlement with Celsius that includes a permanent ban on handling customers&#8217; assets.</p>



<p>Celsius Network has been embroiled in a serious legal struggle. The company recently <a href="https://coincu.com/202720-celsius-network-faces-4-7b-settlement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">agreed</a> to a $4.7 billion deal with US government officials on fraud claims.</p>

<p>This settlement, which is one of the biggest in FTC history, is likely to resolve the accusations against Celsius Network. The corporation, however, insists that the settlement will have no impact on its current restructuring efforts or the amount it hopes to collect for its consumers.</p>



<p>These developments contribute to the increasing regulatory scrutiny faced by the cryptocurrency industry, following lawsuits against major exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase.</p>



<p>However, in a separate case, Ripple Labs <a href="https://coincu.com/202599-ripple-wins-against-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">secured</a> a victory when a federal judge ruled that the company did not violate federal securities law by selling its XRP token on public exchanges. The ruling led to a surge in the value of the cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>Kwenta has stated that its development team is actively working to address the bug and resolve the issue as quickly as possible. Once the bug is successfully patched, the pledge contract will be reinstated, allowing users to resume trading and accessing v2 rewards without any further concerns.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Celsius Network reaches $4.7 billion settlement over fraud allegations.</em></li>



<li><em>The company insists that the payment has no bearing on its current restructuring efforts.</em></li>



<li><em>The settlement requires the return of customer assets; SEC accuses Mashinsky of misleading investors.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Celsius Network, a bankrupt cryptocurrency lender, has found itself at the center of a major legal battle. The company recently announced a $4.7 billion settlement with U.S. government regulators over allegations of fraud.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-926-1024x682.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-926-1024x682.png" alt="Celsius Network Faces $4.7 Billion Settlement, But The Reorganization Not Affected" class="wp-image-202731" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-926-1024x682.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-926-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-926-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-926-750x500.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-926-1140x760.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-926.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Celsius Network Faces $4.7 Billion Settlement, But The Reorganization Not Affected 16"></a></figure></div>


<p>This settlement, one of the largest in the history of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), is expected to resolve the claims against <a href="https://coincu.com/202694-celsius-keeps-redeeming-64m-altcoins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Celsius Network</a>. However, the company <a href="https://cases.stretto.com/public/x191/11749/PLEADINGS/1174907132380000000104.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maintains</a> that the settlement will not have any impact on its ongoing <a href="https://coincu.com/201180-celsiuss-restructuring-plan-disclosure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reorganization efforts</a> or the amount it aims to recover for its customers.</p>



<p>The situation took a dramatic turn when <a href="https://coincu.com/202559-former-ceo-of-celsius-network-arrested/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alex Mashinsky</a>, the former CEO of Celsius Network, was arrested on federal securities fraud charges. Alongside the arrest, the cryptocurrency exchange agreed to pay the hefty $4.7 billion settlement. The charges against Mashinsky, as filed by federal prosecutors, include securities fraud, commodities fraud, wire fraud, and various securities manipulation and fraud charges. If convicted, both Mashinsky and a co-defendant, Roni Cohen-Pavon, could face significant prison sentences.</p>

<p>The settlement, announced by the FTC, will not be paid until Celsius Network is able to return the remaining customer assets as part of its ongoing bankruptcy proceedings. This condition highlights the priority placed on compensating affected customers.</p>



<p>Simultaneously, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has initiated its own proceedings against Mashinsky and Celsius Network. The SEC&#8217;s charges align with those of the federal prosecutors, alleging that Mashinsky misled investors and engaged in fraudulent manipulation of the price of Celsius&#8217; exchange token, CEL. The complaint also asserts that the company misrepresented its business model and the associated risks to investors.</p>



<p>Celsius Network, based in New Jersey, marketed various cryptocurrency products and services, including interest-bearing accounts, personal loans secured by cryptocurrency deposits, and cryptocurrency exchange. However, the FTC claims that the company and its co-founders, Alex Mashinsky, Shlomi Leon, and Hanoch Goldstein, misappropriated over $4 billion in consumer assets while marketing the platform as a safe place for deposits. It is worth noting that the co-founders have not agreed to the FTC settlement, and their case will proceed to federal court.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-929.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="667" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-929.png" alt="Celsius Network Faces $4.7 Billion Settlement, But The Reorganization Not Affected" class="wp-image-202737" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-929.png 1000w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-929-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-929-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-929-750x500.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" title="Celsius Network Faces $4.7 Billion Settlement, But The Reorganization Not Affected 18"></a></figure></div>


<p>These recent developments come after earlier fraud charges were filed by New York prosecutors against Mashinsky, alleging his involvement in a $20 billion fraud scheme targeting investors. These incidents shed light on longstanding issues within Celsius Network, which had been plagued by problems well before its declaration of bankruptcy in 2022.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a recent <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/658643225/Judgment-Nexo-v-Shulev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">court document</a>, it has come to light that Nexo, a troubled cryptocurrency trading platform, is currently embroiled in a legal dispute with its co-founder, Georgi Shulev, over the whereabouts of $12 million worth of missing assets.

<p>According to the document issued by the High Court of London on June 27, Nexo and Georgi Shulev are contesting the ownership of a Ledger hardware wallet, which supposedly contains a portion of the company&#8217;s cryptocurrency holdings. Shulev, the son of former Bulgarian deputy prime minister Lydia Shuleva, co-founded Nexo in 2019 alongside Antoni Trenchev, a former member of Bulgaria&#8217;s parliament, as well as Kosta Kantchev and Kalin Metodiev. Shulev left the company in 2019, which offers crypto trading, lending, and custody services. The legal dispute has been ongoing since 2022.</p>



<p>Previously, the parties were locked in a battle for control over a BitMEX account, initially opened by Shulev in his name but on behalf of the company. Since Shulev&#8217;s termination in 2019 and subsequent loss of access to his corporate email, both Shulev and Nexo have been vying for control of the account.</p>



<p>After a court ruling in August of the previous year, BitMEX froze the funds and eventually released them to the company. However, due to the significant decline in cryptocurrency prices since September 2019, when the account was frozen, Nexo suffered a loss of approximately $7.9 million in the value of its crypto assets.</p>

<p>Presently, the company and Shulev are entangled in a dispute over another portion of the company&#8217;s crypto holdings, which has ended up either in Shulev&#8217;s possession or in the custody of Bulgarian law enforcement, depending on whose version of events is believed. The court document reveals that the missing wallet contained over $12 million worth of cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>The conflict between Shulev and Nexo dates back to September 2019, when Shulev was terminated from his role as the company&#8217;s managing partner by the board. Following his termination, Shulev reportedly sought compensation for his denied Nexo shares. The court document suggests that access to the company&#8217;s crypto assets may have become a bargaining chip in these negotiations.</p>



<p>In 2020, Shulev allegedly sent an email to asset management company Zeus Capital, claiming that Nexo co-founder Kosta Kantchev had wrongfully denied him the shares he had been promised. Shulev also accused his former employer of breaching users&#8217; trust. The company dismissed Shulev&#8217;s accusations in a comment to online publication Invezz.</p>



<p>After a settlement was reached between Nexo and Shulev regarding the BitMEX account, which required Shulev to return the company&#8217;s assets in his possession and receive a $1 million payment, a new development unfolded. On July 1, 2021, someone transferred 45,232,012 of the company&#8217;s own tokens (NEXO) from the wallet claimed to be controlled by Shulev to a new wallet. Nexo received an email with the seed phrase for the new wallet from an address believed to be <a href="mailto:fill5645@protonmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fill5645@protonmail.com</a>.</p>



<p>While Shulev did not confirm his involvement in the token transfer, he demanded the first installment of the $1 million payment promised to him. Nexo, however, refused to proceed with the payment, demanding that Shulev return other owed crypto assets first. Shulev insisted on receiving his money before returning any assets, resulting in an ongoing deadlock between the two parties.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-925.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-925-1024x768.png" alt="Nexo And Co-Founder Clash In Court Over Missing $12 Million In Crypto Assets" class="wp-image-202727" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-925-1024x768.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-925-300x225.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-925-768x576.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-925-750x563.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-925-1140x855.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-925.png 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Nexo And Co-Founder Clash In Court Over Missing $12 Million In Crypto Assets 21"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Georgi Shulev</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Shulev complained to the court that he was coerced into signing the settlement agreement and other related documents when parting ways with the company. He claimed that Nexo CEO Antoni Trenchev rushed him and even threatened him during the process.</p>



<p>The judge quoted an email allegedly sent by Trenchev to Shulev, saying: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about us &#8211; we will be fine. However, I&#8217;m not so sure about you, the people around you, and any startups, which are about to potentially take off.&#8221; </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Trenchev reportedly made a phone call to Shulev afterward, where Shulev claims Trenchev mentioned that they knew about Shulev&#8217;s pregnant fiancÃ©e and her business dealings being under investigation, without specifying the nature of the investigation. Trenchev allegedly warned Shulev about potential consequences for him and his family.</p>



<p>The dispute between Nexo and Shulev is rife with conflicting claims and confusing narratives. The company asserted in court that Shulev still retained access to a stash of 17.3 BTC, 27,000 USDT, 4.5 ETH, as well as substantial amounts of BNB, XRP, and XML. However, neither Shulev nor Nexo admits to possessing the missing Ledger hardware wallet.</p>



<p>In July 2021, Nexo proposed that Shulev deduct the $1 million settlement from the crypto assets in his possession and return the remainder. In response, Shulev suggested involving an escrow agent to receive any residual assets and oversee the payment of the $1 million owed by Nexo. However, after Nexo requested more details regarding this arrangement, Shulev ceased communication until March 2022.</p>



<p>During the April 2022 court hearings, Shulev claimed that he did not have access to the assets in question. Nexo countered by pointing out that the NEXO tokens they previously received came from the same Ethereum blockchain address that contained other tokens due to be returned, including ETH, USDT, USDC, and BNB. Shulev denied being responsible for the token transfer. The <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x00ee047a66d5cff27587a61559138c26b62f7ceb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">address</a> matches the description of the disputed wallet, which still holds approximately $217,800 worth of BNB.</p>



<p>The judge wrote in their ruling that Shulev&#8217;s claims were not convincing, stating that he was &#8220;clearly in control&#8221; of the assets in question and had breached the contract.</p>



<p>Complicating matters further, other issues within Nexo have come to light during the course of this case. Earlier this year, it was revealed that the company was under investigation by Bulgarian authorities for suspected money laundering, tax offenses, operating without a license, and computer fraud.</p>



<p>Shulev testified that after the Nexo office was searched, he was questioned by the Bulgarian National Investigation Service as a former employee. He claimed to have voluntarily provided a PIN code for Nexo&#8217;s Ledger wallet to investigators on March 21, 2023. On March 31, seven out of the nine cryptocurrencies stored on the device were allegedly transferred to newly created wallets. Shulev stated that the crypto assets are now in the custody of the investigators and cannot be transferred to Nexo. However, the judge found Shulev&#8217;s account unconvincing, ruling that he was the party in breach of the contract and was clearly in control of the assets in question.</p>

This shows that Korean investors are still a major driving force behind this XRP pump. Upbit also ranked first in the trading volume of XLM and ADA, which ranked second and third in 24 hours.</p>



<p>Wu Blockchain reported that the judge held that the XRP token itself is not a security. However, the transactions and schemes around trading it still need to be discussed. The judge further stated that &#8220;XRP, as a digital token, is not in and of itself a contract, transaction, or scheme that embodies the Howey requirements of an investment contract.&#8221;</p>

<p>US House Majority Whip Tom Emmer called the Ripple case a monumental development in establishing that a token is separate and distinct from an investment contract it may or may not be part of. He proposed a bipartisan bill called the Securities Clarity Act, which carves this concept in stone to provide the regulatory confidence needed to ensure that the next iteration of the internet is designed with American values.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>The price of Bitcoin has hit $31,700 after a sideways period at $30,000.</em></li>



<li><em>Some other large-cap coins, such as SOL, ADA, and MATIC, have also recorded growth of 15-20%.</em></li>



<li><em>The main impetus comes from Ripple&#8217;s victory after ruling the nearly three-year-long lawsuit with the SEC.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Bitcoin price surged to a one-year high at $31.7k, leading to a boom for the entire market. Ripple (XRP) is a shining name.</strong></h5>



<p>The largest cryptocurrency by market cap recently traded at $31,500, up 3.67% over the past 24 hours. Before that, its peak hit $31,700, the highest level in more than a year.</p>

<p>Inflation data barely rocked the crypto markets, but Ripple&#8217;s partial victory on Thursday sent Bitcoin and other significant digital assets higher.</p>



<p>Partial victory for Ripple in its battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in Thursday&#8217;s court ruling is believed to be the main driver that sent the entire market boom by the celebratory action of investors.</p>



<p>As previously updated, the US judge <a href="https://coincu.com/202656-xrp-price-surges-by-80-as-us-judge-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ruled</a> that selling their XRP tokens on exchanges and through algorithms does not constitute an investment contract. But the Court also ruled that the institutional token sale violated federal securities laws.</p>



<p>Even so, the judge&#8217;s ruling, along with the support of exchanges with a series of re-listing announcements, helped XRP price bounce more than 85% in a short time.</p>



<p>Overwhelmingly, major cryptocurrencies such as Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC)<a href="https://coincu.com/202683-sol-matic-ada-soar-over-20-after-xrp-judgment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> plummeted </a>after the SEC&#8217;s accusations also spiked by 15-20% in the past 24 hours. Specifically, ADA and SOL recently increased by more than 20% and 17%, respectively. And MATIC, the Polygon blockchain layer two token, which the SEC has also flagged, is up more than 16%.</p>

<p>On the side of the SEC, although agreeing with the Court&#8217;s decision, the agency said it will still take actions to consider and adjust the actions because, in some cases, Ripple is still considered to be in violation of securities law.</p>



<p>Although the final decision has not been reached, the ruling for the case of the SEC and Ripple has created a great incentive for investors because it will lead to the weakening of a series of previous highs of the company. SEC and its desire to control the cryptocurrency market.</p>

<p>Based on court documents, the court&#8217;s recent decision means Celsius has the potential to sell $170 million in smaller cryptocurrency. Switching a large number of tokens can put significant pressure on the market of smaller tokens, significantly as liquidity for these tokens has decreased over the past year.</p>



<p>However, with positive developments from the altcoin market after Ripple&#8217;s XRP token was declared by the court as not a security that is arguably more favorable for Celsius at this time.</p>



<p>The biggest problem right now is that the lending platform&#8217;s native token &#8211; <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/celsius/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CEL</a> &#8211; is virtually illiquid yet makes up 65% of the total altcoin holdings the company holds.</p>



<p>It is known that since Celsius filed for bankruptcy, CEL has gradually lost interest in the community, and the token price also dropped below $1 after peaking at over $8 in 2021.</p>
