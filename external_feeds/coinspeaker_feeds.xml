<p>Amid the US regulatory crackdown and the fall of the crypto-friendly banks recently, the lack of liquidity has become a major issue currently in the market. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitcoin-27000-us-regulatory/">Bitcoin (BTC) Price Tanks Under $27,000 amid Rising US Regulatory Pressures</a></p>
<p>The world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC</a>) continues to face more and more selling pressure as US regulatory crackdown mounts further. In the last 24 hours, the BTC price has dropped by over 2.98% and is currently trading at a price of $26,654 with a market cap of $516 billion.</p>
<p>The latest drop in the Bitcoin price comes along with a market-wide correction with the entire crypto market cap dropping to $1.1 trillion. Along with BTC, altcoins have also entered a correction of a similar magnitude.</p>
<p>The world&#8217;s second-largest crypto Ethereum (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ETH</a>) is down by 3.31% and is trading at $1,769 with a market cap of above $212 billion. Furthermore, altcoins like Polygon (MATIC), Polkadot (DOT), and others have also corrected by 3% and more, as of press time.</p>
<p>The US regulatory crackdown has recently forced more crypto firms to move out of the market. Earlier this week, two of the world&#8217;s top market-making firms &#8211; Jane Street Group and Jump Crypto &#8211; announced a pullback from the US market citing regulatory uncertainty and the difficulty of doing business.</p>
<p>Although both these firms announced an exit from the US market, they will continue their operations in the international market. However, as we know, the US is the biggest market when it comes to offering crypto liquidity. David Wells, CEO of Enclave Market <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/11/bitcoin-falls-below-27000-as-crypto-market-makers-step-back-from-us-trading.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">told</a> CNBC:</p>
<blockquote><p>“In general, we’re going to see much larger swings in price both ways since so many large market makers have significantly reduced providing. Larger market makers create more stability in prices due to the liquidity they provide,” he added. “You’ll see more frequent gaps up and down since order books are thinner in general.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>US Regulatory Crackdown Intensifies</h2>
<p>Following the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX in November 2022, the US regulatory crackdown has intensified. On the other hand, the regulators have also blamed the recent banking crisis in the US on the crypto market.</p>
<p>Earlier this year in February,  the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued a joint warning to banks over the risks associated with banking crypto firms.</p>
<p>The regulators have also been going after some of the top crypto exchanges including the giants like Coinbase and Binance. Earlier this week, crypto exchange Bittrex announced bankruptcy amid strong regulatory action by the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>.</p>
<p>Following the closure of crypto-friendly banks like Silvergate Capital and Signature Bank, the illiquidity in the market has shot up significantly. After a strong rally to $30,000 last month, Bitcoin is facing selling pressure. It is still trading at more than 65% gains year-to-date.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/metamask-us-eth-paypal/">MetaMask Adds Support for US-based Users to Purchase ETH via PayPal</a></p>
<p>Crypto wallet MetaMask has begun rolling out PayPal-powered Ether (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ETH</a>) purchases to all its US-based users. Although it <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/paypal-metamask-crypto-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added the PayPal integration</a> to its software wallet last December, the feature was not immediately available to all users in the US.</p>
<p>However, the latest reports suggest that all users in the United States may now seamlessly purchase and transfer ETH directly from their MetaMask mobile apps.</p>
<p>The rollout has been confirmed by MetaMask to be a first of its kind. According to the company, it is the first Web 3.0 wallet to offer ETH transactions via <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/paypal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PayPal</a>.</p>
<h2>MetaMask Continues Striking Partnership Deals Focused on Bolstering Crypto Adoption</h2>
<p>MetaMask has been focused, primarily, on expanding its reach and boosting global crypto adoption. To this end, it has been pushing for strategic integrations and partnerships in recent times.</p>
<p>Recall, the crypto wallet already enjoys partnerships with multiple payment providers. Some of them include MoonPay, Coinbase Pay, Transak and Wyre, and Sardine among others. Therefore, PayPal is only the latest payment firm to join its fast-growing community of payment providers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, MetaMask also recently introduced a new feature it calls “Buy Crypto”. The feature allows users to purchase crypto with fiat currency directly from its Portfolio DApp. With the feature, users may purchase cryptocurrencies via various payment means including bank transfers and debit or credit cards.</p>
<p>Similarly, PayPal also does not come into the partnership empty-handed. The partners appear to have their goals aligned considering that PayPal has also been keen on crypto adoption. According to a Q1 <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001633917/195d9afa-779f-4932-b227-90f0a170923e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a> it filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>), PayPal now has a total of $943 million in crypto assets. And that represents about a 56% jump from what it had in the previous quarter.</p>
<p>The report, without a doubt, is proof of its efforts toward crypto adoption and MetaMask is sure to help advance those aims. MetaMask will also seek to take advantage of PayPal&#8217;s wide user base to expand its reach and offer on-ramps for its customers. As of publication, PayPal has no less than 429 million users globally.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/meta-ai-services-ad-campaigns/">Meta Reveals New AI Services for Ad Campaigns</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/meta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta Platforms Inc</a> (NASDAQ: META) recently uncovered several new artificial intelligence (AI) resources and services for advertisers. On Thursday, the Menlo Park-based tech giant announced a veritable AI “testing playground” called AI Sandbox to help advertisers build campaigns.</p>
<p>By trying out new generative AI-powered ad tools in the Meta-enabled AI Sandbox, advertisers will have access to several tools. These include text variation (generating multiple text versions for emphasis), background creation (generating background images from text inputs), and image cropping (adjusting creative assets across various surfaces).</p>
<p>Meta also announced other AI services, including updates to its collection of automated tools and services called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/733979527611858" target="_blank">Meta Advantage</a>. The company disclosed that it is working with a sample group of advertisers to test-run its new offerings and gather feedback for enhancements. Speaking on how Meta’s new offerings would ultimately enhance ad performance, the company’s vice president of monetization John Hegeman <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/11/meta-announces-ai-sandbox-and-updates-to-meta-advantage.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The aim here, again, is really to quickly test and learn and figure out which parts of these new capabilities are turning out to be most helpful for businesses to achieve their goals.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Meta to Roll Out New AI Services in The Summer</h2>
<p>Starting in July, Meta plans to allow advertisers to integrate some of the new AI features into existing product offerings. The company also explained that the gradual rollout of its new services is deliberate to ensure quality value proposition to its millions of ad clients.</p>
<p>As Hegeman put it:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Overall, the generative AI space is developing incredibly quickly right now, and it’s a very exciting time. Our unique opportunity is to integrate these features over time into our products.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Meta’s ‘AI Sandbox’ and ‘Advantage’ reflect the company’s ongoing efforts to secure its position at the helm of metaverse adaptation. Furthermore, the multinational technology conglomerate also seeks to stoke investor and advertiser interest in the AI space amid slowing ad growth.</p>
<p>In Meta’s <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/meta-q1-2023-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest earnings call</a>, chief financial officer Susan Li put the company’s full-year capital expenditure between $30 billion and $33 billion. Li explained that Meta’s outlay reflected its “ongoing build-out of AI capacity to support ads, Feed, and Reels.” Furthermore, she added that the company exercised an increased investment capacity for its generative artificial intelligence initiatives.</p>
<p>Leveraging AI tech across all its apps and platforms remains Meta’s core aim as it seeks to improve end-user experience.</p>
<h2>Meta Advantage</h2>
<p>Meta recently improved Advantage to enable swifter and more innovative ad campaigns and optimized results. The company pointed out that it strengthened its Meta Advantage automated products in 2022 and has seen business adoption grow. For example, Meta noted that three times as many advertisers use Advantage+ shopping campaigns compared to 6 months ago.</p>
<p>New Meta Advantage features include deploying video creative in catalog ads and rolling out performance comparisons. In addition, users can now switch manual campaigns to Advantage+ shopping at the click of a button. This transformation allows such businesses to leverage artificial intelligence quickly and seamlessly.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/elon-musk-steps-down-twitter-ceo/">Elon Musk to Step Down as Twitter CEO in Six Weeks</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/elon-musk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elon Musk</a> has finally found a new CEO for <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/twitter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter Inc</a> after a few months of searching. Within the next six weeks, Elon Musk will step down from his position, and a new CEO whose name has not been disclosed will take over the company. Notably, Musk will remain Twitter&#8217;s executive chairman and chief technology officer, which means he will continue to oversee the company.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Excited to announce that I’ve a new CEO for X/Twitter. She will be starting in ~6 weeks!</p>
<p>My role will transition to being exec chair &amp; CTO, overseeing product, software &amp; sysops.</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1656747082571722753?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">May 11, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Back in December 2022, Musk announced his decision to step down as Twitter CEO as soon as a replacement would be found. At that time, the billionaire published a poll asking his followers to decide whether he should stay on or quit as the CEO of the company. As we <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/elon-musk-twitter-ceo-replacement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>, the results of the poll that saw more than 17.5 million participants were in favor of finding another chairman, with 57.5% votes for Musk stepping down.</p>
<p>While Elon Musk has not revealed the name of the next Twitter CEO, The Wall Street Journal has <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/linda-yaccarino-in-talks-new-twitter-ceo-elon-musk-7a006bb5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> about <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/linda-yaccarino/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linda Yaccarino</a> being the one. Linda Yaccarino is Chairman of Global Advertising and Partnerships at NBCUniversal – one of the world&#8217;s leading media and entertainment companies in the development, production, and marketing of entertainment, news, and information. She has been with the company since 2011. Recently, there have been reports about Linda Yaccarino being in talks with Elon Musk regarding the role.</p>
<h2>Twitter Under Elon Musk&#8217;s Guidance</h2>
<p>Under Elon Musk&#8217;s leadership, Twitter has significantly transformed. Since he closed a $44 billion deal to acquire the platform, Twitter has seen mass layoffs of employees, account suspensions, content policy changes, revamp of subscription services, and more.</p>
<p>Firstly, the billionaire had slashed the company’s workforce from a high of about 7,500 to a low of 2,000 in one of the most drastic job cuts, with the aim to reduce the operational cost of the company. Notably, cutting the workforce by around 75% has raised concerns about Twitter&#8217;s capacity to maintain its platform.</p>
<p>Secondly, Twitter launched a new version of its subscription service, Twitter Blue, which allowed users to access verification if they pay a monthly fee of $8. The initiative did not work as planned. Many celebrities and high-profile figures like <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/bill-gates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bill Gates</a>, Oprah Winfrey, Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, Kim Kardashian, and others lost their verified blue check marks as they did not subscribe to the service. As a result, the removal of blue ticks provoked confusion, many users found it rude and objected to the changes amid fears that such a system would encourage the spread of misinformation and fake news.</p>
<p>A few days after the removal of the blue ticks, Twitter started giving them back to high-profile accounts with over one million followers.</p>
<p>During Elon Musk&#8217;s leadership, Twitter also suffered a few technical errors and outages. One of them took place in February, it lasted for hours and required an emergency fix, prompting an apology from the company.</p>
<h2>Tesla Shares Affected by Musk&#8217;s Resignation</h2>
<p>Notably, Musk&#8217;s announcement about stepping down as Twitter CEO has had a positive impact on shares of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=tesla+coinspeaker&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tesla Inc</a> (NASDAQ: TSLA). Apparently, Tesla investors are happy about the move, as Tesla stock added 2.10% to its price and closed at $172.08 per share following the announcement. After hours, Tesla shares jumped by another 1.55% to $174.75.</p>
<p>Earlier, Tesla investors were saying that Musk was distracted by running Twitter and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/spacex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SpaceX</a>, which affected the performance of the EV maker.</p>

<p>While it remains unclear how the emerging decentralized social projects will generate profit, they keep getting more attention.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/dorsey-bluesky-musk-twitter/">Jack Dorsey-Backed Bluesky Goes Head-to-Head with Musk’s Twitter</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/jack-dorsey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jack Dorsey</a>-backed decentralized communications app Bluesky has positioned itself as a major rival to the popular social networking service <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/twitter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a>. Bluesky, which has the support of the former Twitter co-founder, was founded in 2021 and hired its first employees in the same year. How is an established app with seasoned past and existing leadership and a massive user base facing new competition with Bluesky, which came to light about two years ago?</p>
<p>Twitter has faced multiple backlash since <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/elon-musk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elon Musk</a> acquired the company in October 2022, after which he made it a private company. The billionaire has been restructuring Twitter, and the company’s makeover has triggered new interest in decentralized social networks. As opposed to companies with CEOs, decentralized social media platforms like what Bluesky is purporting have no owners or leaders. They also do not have obligations concerning commercial or financial interests. According to advocates of decentralized social networks, these projects are less likely to collect and sell users’ data and less susceptible to censorship. As for Bluesky, the app runs on the AT protocol, a decentralized networking technology.</p>
<p>Basically, Musk’s Twitter is different from Dorsey’s Twitter. Starting with including subscription-only features to major layoffs and giving back access to controversial users, the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/twitter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tesla</a> CEO has fundamentally changed what Twitter used to be under the former leadership.</p>
<h2>Bluesky Gains Popularity over Twitter</h2>
<p>Citing data from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, Bluesky has gained massive popularity over the past few months. However, its total download volume is still far below Twitter’s. Data provided by the intelligence firm shows that the social messaging app recorded a whopping 606% surge in monthly mobile downloads in April. There were 628,000 mobile downloads in the month following its <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/jack-dorsey-bluesky-android/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">availability on Android</a> and iOS.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Twitter had 14.9 million app downloads in April. Despite the margin between Twitter and Bluesky, Twitter’s mobile downloads only grew 2% from the previous month. The company accumulated 14.6 million downloads in March. As a matter of fact, the Elon Musk-owned social networking service saw a decline in mobile app downloads in February. The figures dropped from January&#8217;s 17.2 million to 14.05 million in the second month of the year. Besides rivaling Twitter, Bluesky is gaining more attention than the decentralized messaging app Mastodon. While many grew interested in the messaging app in November, the buzz seems to have dropped. Mastodon had just 90,000 downloads last month.</p>
<p>Members of the Bluesky project <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/2-7-2022-overview" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a> the formation of its Public Benefit LLC in February 2022. In the announcement, the team named Dorsey as one of the board members. A couple of months later, the company revealed that it got $13 million in funding and emphasized Jack’s position as a board member.</p>
<p>While it remains unclear how the emerging decentralized social projects will generate profit, they keep getting more attention. Other examples, in addition to Bluesky and Mastodon, are Lens and Farcaster.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/alphabet-google-ai-venture/">Alphabet (GOOGL) Shares Aim to Revisit ATH as Wall Street Remains Bullish on Google’s AI Venture</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/alphabet-inc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alphabet Inc</a> (NASDAQ: GOOGL) shares have strongly rebounded from 2022 lows YTD. As a well-diversified tech company that has invested billions of dollars in different economic sectors, its stock market is well-poised to revisit its ATH and beyond. However, it is the artificial intelligence (AI) venture through one of its subsidiaries Google LLC that has convinced its shareholders to remain bullish. During this year’s Google <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ai-google-i-o-2023-conference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">annual I/O Developers conference</a> held on Wednesday, it was evident that Alphabet is keen on AI development.</p>
<p>According to the latest market data provided by TradingView and MarketWatch, GOOGL shares gained approximately 11 percent in the past five days to trade around $116.63 during Thursday’s after-hours session. The recent gains materialized following a 4.32 percent pump on Thursday. Notably, GOOGL shares have ranged between 83.34 &#8211; 122.43 in the past 52 weeks with an average volume of about $38.46 million.</p>
<p>From a stock index perspective, Alphabet shares are among the best-performing equities with a gain of about 33 percent YTD.</p>
<p>“We remain bullish and view I/O as a clearing event that will help erode the heavily debated ‘AI overhang’ … and narrow GOOGL’s current valuation gap vs. peers,” <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/morgan-stanley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morgan Stanley</a> analyst Brian Nowak wrote.</p>
<h2>Alphabet Market Outlook</h2>
<p>According to a study conducted by MarketWatch, 52 ratings gave GOOGL shares an average target price of 129.21 with an average recommendation of Buy.</p>
<p>For instance, a <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/quote/GOOGL/analyst-ratings" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a> on May 11 by JMP Securities issued a price target of $132.00 expecting GOOGL shares to rise within 12 months, which could mean a possible 13.24 percent upside from current levels. Other analysts from B of A Securities, and Citigroup have maintained their ratings Buy on Alphabet shares.</p>
<p>The American multinational technology conglomerate holding company is, however, expecting stiff competition from <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft Corporation</a> (NASDAQ: MSFT), <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/meta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta Platforms Inc</a> (NASDAQ: META), and OpenAI in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the company has continued to integrate its subsidiaries through AI and cloud computing. During the 2023 first quarter financial results, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/sundar-pichai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sundar Pichai</a>, CEO of Alphabet and Google, noted that the company&#8217;s cloud computing sector has attracted huge global momentum to assure future growth prospects.</p>
<p>“…With Search performing well and momentum in Cloud. We introduced important product updates anchored in deep computer science and AI. Our North Star is providing the most helpful answers for our users, and we see huge opportunities ahead, continuing our long track record of innovation,” Pichai <a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/static/pdf/2023Q1_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf?cache=0924ccf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">noted</a>.</p>
<p>The introduction of AI and cloud computing has helped Alphabet reduce expenses through workforce cuts.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/emirates-record-annual-profit-3b/">Emirates Group Reports Record Annual Profit of $3B after Prior Devastations of Covid-19 Restrictions</a></p>
<p>Emirates Group, a state-owned Dubai-based international aviation holding company, released its 2022-2023 financial results. According to the announcement, Emirates achieved a record annual profit of AED 10.9 billion, approximately $3 billion. The airline service company was impressed with the financial year 2022-2023, after posting a huge decline in operations during the prior year due to Covid-19-related constraints.</p>
<h2>Emirates and Its Record Results</h2>
<p>The Emirates Group announced its yearly revenue grew by approximately 81 percent to AED 119.8 billion or about $32.6 billion. As a result, the Emirates Group ended the financial year with the highest-ever cash balance of AED 42.5 billion or about $ 11.6 billion.</p>
<p>In this regard, the Emirates Group has since declared a dividend of AED 4.5 billion, or about $1.2 billion to its owner Investment Corporation of Dubai (ICD). The airline has attributed its success to the leadership of HH Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, Chairman and Chief Executive, of Emirates Airlines and Group.</p>
<p>“The Group is the biggest player in the UAE’s aviation sector, which supports over 770,000 jobs and generates an estimated contribution to GDP of over US$ 47 billion (AED 172.5 billion),” the Emirates Group’s CEO noted.</p>
<p>As a state-owned organization, the Emirates Group enjoyed tremendous support in debts to sustain its huge fleet and employees through the Covid pandemic.</p>
<p>“Our ongoing investments in our brand, and our products and services, helped drive customer preference and position us favorably in the market,” Sheikh Ahmed <a href="https://www.emirates.com/media-centre/emirates-group-announces-2022-23-results/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">noted</a>.</p>
<h2>Emirates Group Market Outlook</h2>
<p>The Emirates Group continued to restructure its airline operations to attract more passengers and cargo transportation. For the financial year that ended 31 March 2023, Emirates Group announced global freight expansion to different destinations including Tanzania, Germany, Canada, and Brazil. As a result, the Group anticipates reporting even better results for the financial year ahead as all the Covid-19 restrictions have already been removed.</p>
<p>“We go into 2023-24 with a strong positive outlook and expect the Group to remain profitable. We will work hard to hit our targets while keeping a close watch on inflation, high fuel prices, and political and economic uncertainty,” Sheikh Ahmed added.</p>
<p>Following increased business operations, the Group announced its total workforce increased by 20 percent to 102,379 employees from different nationalities.  The Emirates Group also plans to continue its professional hiring spree as it intends to add more multi-billion dollar aircraft.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, the Dubai-based airline received two new 777 freighter aircraft and intends to add five additional Boeing 777-300ER. Furthermore, the airline announced that it carried 43.6 million passengers during the financial year 2022-2023, representing an uptick of 123 percent.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/pacwest-shares-decline-deposits/">PacWest (PACW) Shares Plunge 23% after Revealing 9.5% Decline in Deposits</a></p>
<p>PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ: PACW), a regional bank based in California, is seeing its shares plummet by 23%, days after <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/11/pacwest-shares-tumble-20percent-after-regional-bank-says-deposits-fell-9point5percent-last-week.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reporting</a> a 9.5% drop in deposits for the week ending May 4, 2023.</p>
<p>Notably, the decline in deposits was attributed to media reports that the regional bank was considering several strategic options in the wake of the current banking chaos in the US. Interestingly, stocks of PacWest were already down by 50% this month, and over 70% for the year.</p>
<p>The fact that PacWest&#8217;s stock price tumbled by 20% in response to the news highlights the level of concern among investors. When a bank&#8217;s deposits decline, it can be a sign of broader financial troubles that could ultimately threaten the bank&#8217;s long-term viability. As a result, shareholders might be more inclined to sell their bank shares, which could cause the stock price to drop significantly.</p>
<p>The regional banking sector has experienced a major contagion with Western Alliance Bancorporation (NYSE: WAL) stock <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/pacwest-shares-western-alliance-collapse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plunging by down</a> last week. The stock has shed more than 38% and changing hands at a price of $18.20. Similarly, shares of Zions Bancorporation (NASDAQ: ZION) also dropped by 2.7%, while the SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) were down 1.9%.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of March, regional banks in the US have been facing regulatory actions due to concerns about their financial health. As a result, Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and were finally seized by regulators. <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/first-republic-bank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">First Republic Bank</a> (OTCMKTS: FRCB) was also taken over and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/first-republic-bank-shares-q1-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> to <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/jpmorgan-chase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co</a> (NYSE: JPM).</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the failure of a bank can have serious consequences for the broader economy. It can lead to job losses, financial market instability, and damage to confidence in the banking system.</p>
<h2>PacWest Shares Recovery Options</h2>
<p>There are various choices accessible to PacWest Bancorp that could assist the business overcome the present shares devaluation. Firstly, the regional bank could improve consumer confidence by talking openly about the bank&#8217;s financial health, emphasizing its strengths, and laying out strategies to rectify any weaknesses.</p>
<p>Secondly, PacWest may consider merging with or acquiring another bank in order to gain scale and improve its competitiveness. This could also help the bank diversify its operations and expand into new markets. Meanwhile, the bank has previously announced that it is considering <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/pacwest-sale-stock-drawdown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selling</a> its assets after efforts to raise capital remain afloat.</p>
<p>In addition, PacWest could cut its operating expenses to boost its profitability and financial health. This could entail laying off employees or closing branches, renegotiating contracts with suppliers, or establishing more efficient processes. Markedly, the bank has established to <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/pacwest-dividend-regional-banks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cut down</a> shareholders&#8217; dividends.</p>
<p>Finally, PacWest may also resort to repurchasing its own stock to bolster the stock price. This could indicate to investors that the bank believes its shares are undervalued and is optimistic about its long-term prospects.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the bank will need to thoroughly assess its condition and identify the best course of action to enhance its financial performance and restore investor trust.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/circle-usdc-reserves-us-default/">Circle Adjusting Its USDC Reserves for Avoiding US Default Risks</a></p>
<p>In a recent development, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/usd-coin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USDC</a> stablecoin issuer <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/circle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Circle</a> has reported that it has recently adjusted its reserve treasury in order to avoid the risks of US debt defaults. On Wednesday, May 10, Circle CEO <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/jeremy-allaire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeremy Allaire</a> appraised the same stating that the firm has adjusted the mix of reserves backing the stablecoin USDC by switching to shirt-dated US Treasurys.</p>
<p>Allaire stated that Circle now no longer holds Treasurys maturing beyond early June since they don&#8217;t want to carry exposure “through a potential breach of the ability of the US government to pay its debts&#8221;.</p>
<p>“We don’t want to carry exposure through a potential breach of the ability of the US government to pay its debts,&#8221; <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/circle-reportedly-adjusts-usdc-reserves-to-avoid-us-default-risk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> Allaire. As per the disclosure coming from Circle Reserve Fund, which is managed by BlackRock, the current US Treasury holdings by Circle don&#8217;t mature beyond May 31.</p>
<p>Circle&#8217;s USDC stablecoin is still the second-largest stablecoin with a market cap of $30 billion. Earlier this week, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that the Biden government will be forced to take a decision if Congress doesn&#8217;t come to a common ground on increasing the debt ceiling.</p>
<p>Currently, the Biden administration and the Republicans are in a conflict over raising the $31.4 trillion borrowing limit. The US is currently very close to a default on its debt. Thus, failing to raise the debt ceiling could cause havoc in the global financial system.</p>
<h2>Tether vs Circle</h2>
<p>Amid the current banking crisis in the United States, stablecoin issuers like Tether and Circle have been moving their reserves to the safest instrument i.e. US Treasury. In its recent <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/tether-strong-q1-btc-gold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a>, Tether noted that they have also moved a majority of their reserves to US Treasury.</p>
<p>Circle has passed through turbulent times this year so far with the USDC stablecoin losing its peg earlier in March 2023. This led to major withdrawals from the USD Coin with its market cap dropping by more than 25% just over the last month. Despite this, USDC is currently the second-largest stablecoin with a market cap of $30 billion.</p>
<p>Over the last year, the USDC supply in the market has dropped by 46%. Last month in April Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire blamed the current banking crisis and the SEC&#8217;s war on crypto for USDC&#8217;s shrinking market cap.</p>

<p>Venom Foundation, which recently hit the news with its <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/venom-foundation-launches-hackathon-225000-prize-pool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testnet launch and hackathon</a>, has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Kenyan government. This partnership is billed to help in setting up a blockchain hub in Kenya, focusing on the development of Web 3.0 applications.</p>
<p>As it was <a href="https://chainwire.org/2023/05/10/venom-to-launch-a-blockchain-hub-with-kenyan-government/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a>, the hub aims to promote the adoption and development of blockchain technology in Kenya and the wider African region.</p>
<h2>Venom Unlocks Blockchain Potentials in Africa</h2>
<p>Interestingly, the leading blockchain-based payment gateway provider aims to empower African communities, create a bridge between traditional finance and the Web 3.0 world, and stimulate regional economic growth by enabling seamless cross-border trade and transactions. It will also provide tools and resources to support African countries in laying a solid foundation for digital transformation.</p>
<p>Likewise, Venom’s blockchain hub in Kenya will provide a platform for developers, startups, and established companies to collaborate and innovate with blockchain technology. The hub will also offer training and education programs to help individuals and businesses understand the potential of blockchain technology and how to integrate it into their operations.</p>
<p>The minister of treasury in Kenya expressed his enthusiasm for the partnership. In his <a href="https://twitter.com/honmoses_kuria/status/1656085322269356033?s=12&amp;t=y-TJeb_fYYjfzECkBHm4Tg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweet</a>, the partnership with Venom Foundation is a significant boost for Kenya and will drive further innovation in several industries, benefiting everyone both globally and nationally.</p>

<p>Notably, Kenya is widely regarded as a leader in digital innovation in Africa, with a thriving fintech industry and a growing startup ecosystem. As such, the launch of Venom’s blockchain hub in the country will further cement Kenya’s position as a hub for digital innovation in the region. The partnership aims to promote efficiency, transparency, and trust across different sectors in the continent.</p>
<p>Venom’s blockchain hub is also expected to attract a wide range of stakeholders, including developers, entrepreneurs, investors, and regulators. The hub will provide a platform for collaboration and innovation, as well as an opportunity to explore the potential of blockchain technology in various industries in Kenya and the wider Africa region.</p>
<h2>Venom Foundation Secures Strategic Partnership</h2>
<p>Earlier in the year, the layer 1 blockchain firm <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/venom-foundation-and-hub71-partner-to-accelerate-growth-and-adoption-of-blockchain-technologies-from-abu-dhabi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teamed</a> up with Hub71, a global tech ecosystem located in Abu Dhabi to provide enterprise-level solutions for startups and simplify blockchain adoption with a focus on the growth of businesses and acceptance of blockchain technologies in the MENA region and beyond.</p>
<p>The Venom Foundation collaboration with Hub71+ Digital Assets, an ecosystem dedicated to Web3 and Digital Assets seeks to complement the growth push for businesses. It aims to do this by helping with business development, digital asset regulation, blockchain adoption, and relevant technologies.</p>
<p>In a similar manner, Venom also <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/venom-blockchain-partners-dao-maker-incubate-web3-startups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entered a partnership</a> with leading blockchain solutions provider DAO Maker to incubate Web 3.0 projects centered on delivering real-world use cases.</p>
