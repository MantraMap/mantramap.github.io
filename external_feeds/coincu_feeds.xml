<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Facing accusations of selling, the CZ executive said Binance did not sell any BTC or BNB.</em></li>



<li><em>The CEO of analytics tool CryptoQuant also concurred that it is difficult to confirm that Binance is liquidating.</em></li>



<li><em>However, amid the price storm, many people believe that Binance is liquidating BTC to avoid a BNB liquidation at $200.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) tweeted that Binance is not selling Bitcoin or BNB amid the liquidation allegations.</strong></h5>



<p>Today, allegations surfaced that Binance and CZ were selling spot Bitcoin at an alarming rate, in order to protect <a href="https://news.coincu.com/194184-whale-transfers-63340-bnb-price-drops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the $220 BNB liquidation pool</a> as spot Bitcoin sold off.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">

<p>In light of these allegations, CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) received and said that Binance is not selling BTC or BNB, while it is holding a large amount of the crypto exchange&#8217;s FTT tokens. went bankrupt FTX.</p>

<p>Agreeing with this opinion is the founder and CEO Ki Young Ju of on-chain data analysis tool CryptoQuant. He thinks that it is impossible to be sure that it is CZ and will prioritize the BNB-pegged BTC reward exchange option for the ecosystem.</p>



<p>&#8220;Not a BNB fan, but hard to say he&#8217;s selling with these clues tho. If I were CZ, I&#8217;d prioritize #Bitcoin into BNB-pegged BTC for the ecosystem. I don&#8217;t see any significant redeeming activities for now.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, this doesn&#8217;t seem to stop the community&#8217;s speculation as when spot Bitcoin was sold off, BNB was bought, which protected the $220 liquidation and this in turn limited Bitcoin&#8217;s upside potential.</p>

<p>BTC price yesterday evening had a slight recovery after receiving positive news about the CPI report that met expectations, causing the Fed&#8217;s interest rate hike policy to cool down. But then the price quickly corrected down from $26,300 to $25,700.</p>



<p>According to DefiLlama estimates, this loan will be liquidated when BNB reaches a price of about $219.32, equivalent to $200 million of BNB sold on the market. Currently BNB is trading at $249, up 9% over the past 24 hours.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that it is expected to take 120 days to respond to <a href="https://news.coincu.com/193993-coinbase-ceo-tense-relationship-gensler/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase&#8217;s request </a>to develop rules for trading digital assets.</em></li>



<li><em>The Commission also asked the Court to drop Coinbase&#8217;s seven-day lawsuit requiring the agency to develop a seven-day legal framework.</em></li>

<p>The agency held that there was no merit to Coinbase&#8217;s unusual request for an order to compel the Commission to act on Coinbase&#8217;s wide-ranging rule-making petition within seven days. It said it has yet to decide what action to take upon request. In a filing with the US Third Circuit Court of Appeals, the regulator argued that the petition should be denied.</p>



<p>Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal then said the SEC &#8220;ignore[d] the clear statements of the Chair that confirm they have no intent to issue new rules, and instead conflate the evidence of a decision those statements provide with an argument that the Statements are themselves a decision, &#8220;though its Chair do that &#8220;statements by the not – and could not – Commission action denying Coinbase&#8217;s rule-making petition.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reportedly, Coinbase has requested explicit rules intended to replace existing requirements, and the SEC filed a lawsuit against Coinbase last week, accusing the company of unregistered securities trading. On June 6, the Court gave this agency seven days to clarify its position on Coinbase&#8217;s lawsuit. Coinbase sued this agency in April over its response to its 2022 rule-making request.</p>

<p>After receiving a lawsuit, the largest US cryptocurrency exchange also showed a persistent attitude by declaring that it would not destroy any alleged securities tokens. In addition, Coinbase has also repeatedly made allegations that the SEC and Chairman Gary Gensler have frequently ignored requests to develop rules from companies providing crypto services over the years.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Binance.US has convinced the US Judge to deny the SEC&#8217;s request to freeze assets.</em></li>



<li><em>This will allow Binance.US to continue operating while discussing the ban with regulators.</em></li>



<li><em>The Securities and Exchange Commission and Binance&#8217;s attorneys were asked to continue negotiating limits on the company and report back on Thursday.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to Coindesk, the federal judge responsible for overseeing the lawsuit of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange declined to issue a temporary restraining order to <a href="https://news.coincu.com/194356-binance-us-market-depth-plunges-by-78/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">freeze Binance.US assets</a> during the investigation.</strong></h5>

<p>This will allow Binance.US to continue operating while discussing the ban with regulators. If the parties can agree on restrictions, District of Columbia Judge Amy Berman Jackson said there is &#8220;absolutely no need&#8221; to issue an injunction.</p>



<p>At the same time, the judge ordered Binance.US to provide the court with a list of its business expenses and ordered the two sides to continue negotiations and report to the court before leaving work on Thursday.</p>



<p>In a courtroom of people sitting in Washington, a judge rejected SEC attorneys&#8217; recommendation to freeze all company assets until it can be proven that no one on the global platform Binance users, including Changpeng Zhao, can access their private keys.</p>



<p>When asked if any of the Binance.US customer funds had left the US, the judge appeared dismayed with what she heard after multiple SEC attorneys spoke of the relationship. Their primary focus is the global platform of Binance that controls enough private funds.</p>



<p>Earlier in the day, the judge gave some hints that she might be inclined to grant some restriction on Binance&#8217;s access to Binance.US assets but not a total restraining order, ordering the parties to reconcile their proposed regulations and the SEC to compare what it desired with what the parties presented in place of the restraining order itself.</p>

<p>LAST WEEK, the SEC previously sued Binance and Binance.US, along with Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ), alleging they were operating as a stock exchange, brokerage, and settlement agency unregistered clearing. The regulator also alleges the massive mixing of funds allowed Zhao to access Binance.US customer assets.</p>



<p>The crypto exchange has denied the claims in its response to the motion, arguing that the SEC has not conclusively proven that it lists any securities and that the regulator, the court, did not present any evidence to support an urgent motion.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>In a recent robbery impacting Atomic Wallet customers, North Korean hackers stole more than $100 million in cryptocurrency.</em></li>



<li><em>The hackers targeted over 5,500 digital wallets, according to the business, and were members of the North Korean cybercrime ring known as the Lazarus Group.</em></li>



<li><em>The Atomic Wallet team is also working with the police in Estonia, where the firm is registered.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Elliptic, a blockchain forensics company, said on Tuesday that the damages incurred by <a href="https://news.coincu.com/194594-atomic-wallet-hackers-seek-sanctuary-ofac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomic Wallet</a> users as a result of a suspected attack had surpassed $100 million.</strong></h5>

<p>The wallet provider admitted receiving allegations that certain wallets had been hacked but claimed that fewer than 1% of its active customers were impacted. It has yet to offer another update.</p>



<p>Elliptic, which tracked over 5,500 wallets believed to have been targeted in the attack, <a href="https://hub.elliptic.co/analysis/north-korea-linked-atomic-wallet-heist-tops-100-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that the North Korean hacking association Lazarus Group was responsible for what would be the North Korean hacking association&#8217;s first major crypto theft since the $100 million Horizon Bridge exploited a year ago. </p>

<p>Over the first weekend of June, Atomic Wallet customers lost almost $100 million in crypto in Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Tether (USDT), Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin (LTC), BNB, and Polygon (MATIC).</p>



<p>The team behind Atomic Wallet, the hacked non-custodial mobile crypto wallet, is <a href="https://forklog.com/news/rukovodstvo-atomic-wallet-vyzvali-na-dopros" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">working</a> with authorities in Estonia, where the firm is registered. According to the Russian-language news source <em>Forklog</em>, CEO Konstantin Gladych said the team got a request from authorities in Kazakhstan.</p>



<p>The company, which claims to be located in Estonia, previously said that it got allegations of wallets being hacked and that it engaged Chainalysis, another cryptocurrency analytics firm, to examine the matter and trace down stolen assets.</p>



<p>The US authorities tied the Lazarus Group to the high-profile Ronin hack, which resulted in the theft of $600 million in digital assets from the Axie Infinity sidechain. Elliptic believes that the Lazarus Group has stolen more than $2 billion in digital assets over many heists.</p>

<p>The United Nations claimed earlier this year that North Korea stole more crypto assets in 2022 than in any previous year. According to international observers, the stolen funds have been funneled into North Korea&#8217;s sanctioned nuclear and missile programs.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The US Treasury investigated ways to make retail transactions in a prospective CBDC as secret and anonymous as feasible.</em></li>



<li><em>The United States has not yet decided whether to pursue a CBDC.</em></li>



<li><em>CBDCs have been controversial in the United States, with some political officials attempting to outlaw them.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to a Treasury official, the US Treasury is investigating the privacy implications of a future retail central bank digital currency (CBDC).</strong></h5>

<p>Graham Steele, assistant secretary for financial institutions at the US Treasury, <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1530" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke</a> on Tuesday at the Transform Payments US 2023 Conference in Texas on the benefits and drawbacks of retail CBDCs. Nevertheless, he said that the US has not yet determined whether to pursue a CBDC.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“It is important that we consider the extent to which privacy and anonymity might be preserved and explore the technologies and methods available, including Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs), to enable such protections in the design of any potential retail CBDC. Such technologies could play a crucial role in maintaining transactional privacy while also ensuring transparency and traceability,” Steele stated.</p>
</blockquote>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1029-1024x683.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1029-1024x683.png" alt="US Treasury Investigates The Privacy Risks Of CBDC" class="wp-image-194938" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1029-1024x683.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1029-300x200.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1029-768x512.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1029-750x500.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1029-1140x760.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1029.png 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="US Treasury Investigates The Privacy Risks Of CBDC 21"></a></figure></div>


<p>According to him, a retail CBDC that is utilized by the general public might enhance financial inclusion and sustain the face value redemption of the currency, but it could also destabilize private sector financing and raise privacy issues.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“An additional challenge is protecting user privacy while minimizing risks of illicit financial transactions. Fulfilling both of these important objectives requires a careful balance in the design of any potential retail CBDC,” the Treasury official said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As Steele was speaking, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen appeared before the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday, telling legislators that she is still concerned about regulatory vulnerabilities in the regulation of the spot market in non-securities digital assets and stablecoins. She said that the crypto industry requires a complete federal prudential framework and that we would be happy to engage with Congress to see whether such a framework can be developed.</p>

<p>CBDCs have been contentious in the United States, with some political officials attempting to outlaw them. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, now a Republican presidential contender, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/175228-florida-governor-central-digital-currency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">passed</a> legislation last month prohibiting CBDCs, claiming that his state was the first to do so.</p>

<p>Starting in July, Snoop Dogg intends to offer fans an NFT that guarantees owners unique access to updates from the rapper&#8217;s life on tour. The Snoop Dogg Passport Series is billed as the first evolving digital tour collectible and is available on <a href="https://www.snooppassport.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">snooppassport.xyz</a> for around $45 or 0.025 ETH (Ethereum cryptocurrency).</p>



<p>The Snoop Dogg Passport Series, according to the website, is a tour poster that evolves with each place Snoop stops on tour.</p>



<p>Snoop and his team will release behind-the-scenes videos and photographs to the Passport NFT on a regular basis. In conjunction with the start of his <a href="https://snoopdogg.com/appearances/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">summer tour</a> on July 7, Snoop will also release Snoop Selects, a selected collection of works by chosen NFT artists that will be distributed for free to all Passport users. Coldie, Terrell Jones, and Alien Queen are among the first Snoop Selects artists.</p>

<p>In a statement, Snoop Dogg said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“With the Passport Series, I can give my fans the opportunity to travel the world with me — no one’s ever done that. I’ve always been a pioneer, and digital merch is part of the future. I’m hoping other artists can see what I’m doing and continue to innovate on their own.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Snoop Dogg Passport Series technology was developed in collaboration with NFT development firm Transient Labs, which was formed in 2022 and is situated in Colorado. WME, which represents Snoop Dogg and Transient Labs, negotiated the arrangement.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Having the opportunity to connect one of the world’s greatest artists to fans in such a creative and engaging way is a great representation of what we’re all about at Transient Labs,” said Chris Ostoich, Transient Labs&#8217; chief operating officer.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Over the last few years, Snoop Dogg and his son, Cordell Broadus, have been highly interested in NFT collecting and crypto investing. At one point, the rapper even hinted that Death Row Record might become the first big label in the metaverse.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Genesis has filed an updated wind-up plan as mediated talks continue on the funds its owed by parent company DCG.</em></li>



<li><em>The company&#8217;s creditors and other stakeholders reserve their position in negotiations that are still ongoing.</em></li>



<li><em>The document updates a plan first proposed on January 20.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to a Tuesday <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysb.314889/gov.uscourts.nysb.314889.427.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">court filing</a>, bankrupt crypto lender Genesis has submitted an amended wind-up plan. At the same time, mediated negotiations on the monies due by parent firm Digital Currency Group (DCG) continue.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1021.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1021-1024x576.png" alt="Bankrupt Crypto Lender Genesis Revised Chapter 11 Plan As The Negotiations Continue" class="wp-image-194916" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1021-1024x576.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1021-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1021-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1021-750x422.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1021-1140x641.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1021.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Bankrupt Crypto Lender Genesis Revised Chapter 11 Plan As The Negotiations Continue 29"></a></figure></div>


<p>The amended restructuring plan reflects strong consensus on some important areas, according to the filing, although Genesis, its creditors, and other stakeholders retain their position in continuing discussions. The court appointed a mediator to address issues, including the DCG problem, in April for a 30-day term that was later extended.</p>



<p>The plan states that DCG and insolvent hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) claims are challenged and impaired, implying that creditors would not get the full amount of their claims. As Coincu <a href="https://news.coincu.com/192271-3ac-wants-to-reconciliation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, 3AC has sought to join in Genesis&#8217; bankruptcy mediation process.</p>



<p>DCG claims would be treated like other unsecured creditors but will not get any revenues from debts still owed by the parent company, according to the agreement. DCG said in January that it owes Genesis Capital $526 million, due in May 2023, and $1.1 billion on a promissory note due in June 2032.</p>

<p>The complaint said that claims linked to the insolvent crypto exchange FTX and its sibling trading arm Alameda Research should not be permitted to profit from any clawbacks of illicit payments.</p>



<p>FTX claims Genesis owes it $3.9 billion, a claim Genesis denies. In a concurrent filing on Tuesday, FTX contended that its claims against Genesis should be resolved as part of its own Delaware court proceedings.</p>

<p>The proposal was initially offered on January 20, the same day that three Genesis group firms filed for bankruptcy in a New York court.</p>



<p>At a bankruptcy hearing, US Bankruptcy Court Judge Sean Lane <a href="https://news.coincu.com/192488-genesis-granted-recovery-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prolonged</a> a mediation session between crypto lender Genesis and its creditors as emotions flared over the role DCG would play in the lender&#8217;s rehabilitation. A similar agreement would form the basis of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan to pay hundreds of thousands of the company&#8217;s creditors.</p>

<li><em>Testimony highlights the declining share of the US dollar in global foreign exchange reserves, prompting the call for regulatory action to maintain the dollar&#8217;s strength.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a significant development, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire is set to deliver testimony at a digital asset hearing in the US House of Representatives.&nbsp;</strong></h5>

<p>Highlighting the importance of stablecoins, Circle CEO emphasizes that their proper regulation will not only support the US dollar but also enhance the country&#8217;s long-term economic competitiveness.</p>



<p>Allaire emphasizes the critical role of the Stablecoin Act as a fundamental step in creating a comprehensive regulatory framework. He believes that these regulations will have implications far beyond the digital asset market, shaping the movement of the US currency globally for decades to come. It&#8217;s an opportune moment for the United States to take the lead and establish global rules that will influence the circulation of its own currency worldwide.</p>



<p>During his testimony, Allaire draws attention to the decline in the US dollar&#8217;s share in global foreign exchange reserves over the past eight years. With an average annual decrease of around 1 percentage point, it becomes imperative for the US government to act swiftly and strategically to maintain the competitiveness of the dollar.</p>

<p>By advocating for stablecoin regulations, Allaire emphasizes the need to leverage digital assets as a means to strengthen the US economy. Implementing a well-defined regulatory framework for stablecoins will not only instill confidence in the market but also foster innovation and growth in the digital asset sector.</p>



<p>As the hearing unfolds, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/184332-circle-ceo-predicts-global-shift-away/">Circle&#8217;s CEO</a>&#8216;s testimony is poised to shape the discourse surrounding stablecoin regulations and their impact on the US dollar&#8217;s global standing. The decisions made by the US government in this regard will undoubtedly have far-reaching consequences, establishing the foundation for the future movement of the US currency and positioning the country as a leader in shaping global financial rules.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ripple is calling for a new investigation into William Hinman, a former director of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s Division of Corporation Finance, and a speech he gave in 2018 that has been frequently cited in discussions about whether or not a digital asset meets the definition of investment security.</strong></h5>

<p>Stuart Alderoty, Ripple&#8217;s Chief Legal Officer, has <a href="https://twitter.com/s_alderoty/status/1668601239536390144" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">asked</a> for a probe into what or who influenced <a href="https://news.coincu.com/194782-ripple-lawsuits-hinman-docs-are-disclosed-xrp-rises-over-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hinman</a> and why comments on the speech were disregarded. He further implied that Hinman had overstepped his authority by enacting legislation without authorization.</p>



<p>The remark came after records from the SEC&#8217;s continuing litigation against Ripple were published earlier in the day, revealing behind-the-scenes revisions and communication regarding the speech.</p>



<p>In December 2020, the SEC filed a complaint against Ripple, stating that the company and two senior executives generated $1.3 billion via the sale of XRP coins, which the agency considers unregistered securities.</p>

<p>A key component of Ripple&#8217;s defense is determining the SEC&#8217;s securities classification process and determining why XRP was singled out while ETH and BTC were not, doing so required the release of internal SEC documents, including records related to the infamous &#8220;Hinman speech,&#8221; which effectively greenlit the two largest cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>In 2018, the former SEC Director said at the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit: Crypto that a cryptocurrency may no longer be considered a security if its network becomes sufficiently decentralized. He cited Bitcoin and Ethereum as instances of digital assets that satisfy these requirements.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Hinman ignored multiple warnings that his speech contained made-up analysis with no basis in law, was divorced from the Howey factors, exposed regulatory gaps, and would create not just confusion, but &#8216;greater confusion&#8217; in the market,&#8221; Alderoty added.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Additionally, Hinman wrote in an email dated June 4, 2018, that he sees no need to regulate ETH as a security. It also acknowledged speaking with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin over the phone &#8220;to confirm our understanding of how the Ethereum Foundation operates.&#8221;</p>

<p>He suggested that the SEC delete the speech from its website and that it no longer be used in discussions regarding whether or not a security is a token.</p>



<p>Judge Torres refused the SEC&#8217;s move to seal internal records connected to the Hinman address last month. She found that the records were not covered by deliberative process privilege, which allows executive branches of the United States government to avoid disclosure in civil lawsuits.</p>
