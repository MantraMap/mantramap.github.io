Survey data showing this comes after the monetary authority slowed the pace of its rate hikes last week while indicating that it’s still early for a pause.</strong></p>
<h2>ECB Registers Heightened Consumer Expectations About Inflation</h2>
<p>Europeans believe inflation will be around 5% over the next 12 months with their median expectations rising “significantly” in March from 4.6% in February, the European Central Bank (<a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ECB</a>) announced on Thursday, quoting its latest Consumer Expectations Survey (CES).</p>
<p>The poll has been conducted before the ECB’s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ecb-raises-interest-rates-by-25bps-amid-too-high-inflation-no-pause-lagarde-says/">decision</a> to raise interest rates by 25 basis points last week. Despite slowing the pace of rate hikes, the regulator argued that while inflation has declined, underlying price pressures remain strong, signaling further raises are likely.</p>
<p>“Uncertainty about inflation expectations 12 months ahead reached its highest level since the start of the survey in April 2020,” the central bank noted in a press release. Expectations for inflation in the next three years also increased, to 2.9% from 2.4%.</p>

<p>At the same time, consumers expected their nominal income to increase by 1.3% over the next 12 months, compared to 1.2% in the previous survey. Expectations for nominal spending growth over the next year increased to 4.1%, from 3.9% in February.</p>
<p>European expectations for economic growth over the next 12 months became slightly more negative, the ECB remarked, declining to -1.0%, from -0.9%. The expected unemployment rate for the same time period rose to 11.7% from February’s 11.5%.</p>
<p>The CES is a monthly online survey of 14,000 consumers, aged 18 or over, from six euro area countries: Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, and the Netherlands. The ECB uses its results for policy analysis. The latest data supports the views of some <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/europeans-to-see-more-interest-rate-hikes-central-bank-governors-indicate/">members</a> of its Governing Council who have maintained that further rate hikes are warranted by persisting inflation in the eurozone.</p>

Clausi&#x2019;s arrest and subsequent jailing came after a woman, who sold him a Ferrari for $440,000 in April 2021, filed a complaint against the crypto trader when the price of the crypto asset had dropped to just over $30,000.</strong></p>
<h2>Crypto Trader Ordered to Pay Fine of $3.7 Million</h2>
<p>A 21-year-old Frenchman and crypto trader, Thomas Clausi, is currently serving a jail term in Morocco for allegedly buying a supercar worth $400,000 with bitcoin, a report has said. In addition to slapping Clausi with an 18-month jail term, the Moroccan court also ordered the crypto trader to pay a fine of over $3.7 million (&#x20AC;3.4 million).</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://gagarin.news/news/frenchman-sent-to-moroccan-prison-for-using-crypto/">report</a> by Gararin News, trouble for the Frenchman began when a woman who sold him a Ferrari for nearly $440,000 filed a fraud case against him. Although Clausi is said to have paid the full amount in April 2021 using <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, the unnamed woman only filed her complaint in July when the price had dropped. As shown by the crypto asset&#x2019;s data, during this period, the value of one <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> fell from more than $60,000 seen in mid-April to just over $31,500 by July 17, 2021.</p>
<p>Following the filing of the complaint, authorities in Morocco &#x2014; where crypto trading is outlawed &#x2014; are said to have opened an investigation. By October of that year, Clausi was convicted of the crimes of fraud and the &#x201C;payment with foreign currency on Moroccan territory.&#x201D; Although the price of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> did rally to over $40,000 in December, Moroccan authorities were unmoved and still had the Frenchman thrown into prison.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p>Although Clausi is only left with a few months before he finishes the sentence, his lawyers are reportedly still trying to secure his early release. For instance, in one hearing where they were seeking to have his sentence reduced, the lawyers told the court that Clausi had in the past bought expensive Swiss watches using crypto and that the price of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> had similarly surged afterwards.</p>
<p>However, instead of reducing the sentence, the Moroccan court still ordered Clausi to reimburse the seller with an equivalent of $4,200 in local currency.</p>

<h2>US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen Urges Congress to Act Quickly to Avoid Debt Default</h2>
<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has urged Congress to act quickly on the issue of raising the debt ceiling to avoid a possible debt default that would bring negative consequences for the economy of the country. In a press conference in Niigata, Japan, ahead of the G7 meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors, Yellen warned again about the terrible effects that such an event would cause.</p>
<p>Yellen <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/11/yellen-g7-debt-ceiling-unthinkable.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declared</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no good alternative that will save us from catastrophe. I don’t want to get into ranking which bad alternative is better than others, but the only reasonable thing is to raise the debt ceiling and to avoid the dreadful consequences that will come.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, Yellen stated that, for her, this would be a self-inflicted crisis that has no reason to be happening. She explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no good reason to generate a good crisis of our own making. The U.S. Congress has raised or suspended the debt limit almost 80 times since 1960. I urge it to act quickly to do so once again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Defaulting Would Be &#8216;Unthinkable&#8217;</h2>
<p>Yellen had <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/treasury-secretary-yellen-warns-us-could-default-on-its-debt-by-june-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">warned</a> before about the catastrophe that the U.S. defaulting on its debt would mean for the economic system of the country and markets worldwide. Yellen also referred to this issue this time, stating that the consequences would be unthinkable.</p>
<p>She explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The notion of defaulting on our debt is something that would so badly undermine the U.S. and global economy that I think it should be regarded by everyone as unthinkable. America should never default.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bipartisan negotiations on the debt limit issue have not been successful, as the Republican party demands a series of cost cuts that would affect spending in some key areas for the Democrat side, including healthcare and other social benefits. Negotiations are slated to restart this Friday, and Yellen is &#8220;very hopeful&#8221; that the two parties will be able to bridge their differences to raise the debt limit.</p>

The high-tech data centers will rely on a full immersion solution to cool the power-hungry miners as the desert climate renders air-cooled mining infeasible, participants said.</strong></p>
<h2>Advanced Crypto Mining Facilities in Abu Dhabi to Defy Cooling Challenges in Arab Peninsula</h2>
<p>Marathon Digital Holdings, a leading U.S.-based crypto mining company, and emerging blockchain infrastructure developer Zero Two, are working to launch what they say will be the Middle East’s first immersion bitcoin mining operations.</p>
<p>The partners have formed a joint venture, Abu Dhabi Global Markets (ADGM), to develop and run two new sites for digital asset mining with a combined capacity of 250 megawatts (MW), Marathon announced in a press release providing information about the project.</p>
<p>The larger, 200 MW facility will be constructed in Masdar City, the sustainability hub of Abu Dhabi, the capital city of UAE. The other, 50MW crypto farm will be located in the port zone of Mina Zayed, the announcement detailed.</p>
<p>The sites will be powered with excess energy, thus increasing the base load and sustainability of Abu Dhabi’s power grid. The two companies emphasized their intention is to also offset any non-sustainably produced electricity used with clean energy certificates.</p>
<p>Construction of the crypto mining farms is already underway and the mining equipment has been ordered. Both sites, which will have a combined hashrate of approximately 7 EH/s, are expected to come online as early as this year.</p>
<p>Before starting the realization of the project, Marathon Digital and Zero Two launched a pilot program to establish the efficacy of a large crypto mining operation in Abu Dhabi, where the hot desert climate renders air-cooled mining infeasible.</p>
<p>The initial results of the pilot indicate that operating mining sites in the UAE is now feasible thanks to an immersion solution to cool the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ASIC</a> miners, custom-built by the two companies, and implementing proprietary software to optimize their performance.</p>
<p>The equity ownership in the ADGM joint venture will be 80% for Zero Two and 20% for Marathon, with capital contributions in 2023 expected to total around $406 million. The details about the mining project come after analysts recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russia-may-take-up-18-of-bitcoin-hashrate-in-next-big-migration-of-crypto-miners-experts-say/">predicted</a> that increased regulatory pressures, energy costs, and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/white-house-pushes-dame-tax-proposal-to-address-alleged-environmental-costs-of-crypto-mining/">taxes</a> in current mining hotspots may result in a new migration of crypto miners to more favorable jurisdictions.</p>

<h2>SEC Chair Gary Gensler on U.S. Debt Default</h2>
<p>The chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, has weighed in on the impact a U.S. default would have on capital markets as discussions of the U.S. defaulting on its debt obligations heat up in Congress.</p>
<p>“I’d like to say a few words regarding the ongoing discussions in Washington around the debt ceiling,” the SEC chairman said in his remarks before the International Swaps and Derivatives Association annual meeting Wednesday. Gensler cautioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>If the U.S. Treasury as an issuer were actually to default, it would have very significant, hard to predict, and likely lasting effects on investors, issuers, and markets alike.</p></blockquote>
<p>“In a word, it would make the Cyclone Roller Coaster at the 1933 Chicago World’s Fair look like a kiddie ride,” he stressed.</p>
<p>The SEC chairman also clarified: “While we at the SEC have no direct role in those discussions, the outcome is directly consequential to each part of our mission: protecting investors, facilitating capital formation, and maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets.”</p>
<p>He added:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’ve already seen an effect in the pricing and liquidity of short-dated Treasury bills and continue to monitor for any additional tremors.</p></blockquote>
<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen revealed last week that the Treasury Department may not be able to pay all of the government’s bills <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/treasury-secretary-yellen-warns-us-could-default-on-its-debt-by-june-1/">as early as June 1</a> &#8220;if Congress does not raise or suspend the debt limit before that time.” She also warned of &#8220;catastrophic&#8221; consequences of the U.S. defaulting on its debt obligations.</p>

<h2>Goldman Sachs Agrees With Treasury Secretary Yellen on US Default Risks</h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs executive Beth Hammack warned about the risks of the U.S. defaulting on its debt obligations in an interview on Bloomberg Television Tuesday. Hammack is co-head of Goldman Sachs&#8217; Global Financing Group within the Investment Banking Division (IBD) and a member of the firm&#8217;s Management Committee. She also serves as the chair of the U.S. Treasury Department&#8217;s Borrowing Advisory Committee.</p>
<p>Regarding a possible U.S. debt default, she said: &#8220;This is a conundrum for all international investors. They don&#8217;t understand why we&#8217;ve made these appropriations and we&#8217;re not willing to pay the bills that we already agreed we would pay. And so I think that&#8217;s really confusing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Goldman Sachs executive warned, “I think there is real risk to the U.S. dollar as we leave this in a more protracted state of negotiations,” emphasizing:</p>
<blockquote><p>Anything that moves us away from being viewed as the world’s reserve currency, of being the safest most liquid asset in the world, is bad for the American people, bad for the dollar, and bad for the U.S. government.</p></blockquote>
<p>The chair of the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee proceeded to explain that the dislocations being created in the U.S. Treasury bill markets are “inefficient” and they “create extra cost for the taxpayers.”</p>
<p>The Treasury bill markets began factoring in the risks of the U.S. defaulting on its debt obligations from next month onward after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and the Congressional Budget Office <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/treasury-secretary-yellen-warns-us-could-default-on-its-debt-by-june-1/">warned</a> that the Treasury may not be able to pay all of the government’s bill in early June.</p>
<p>The Goldman Sachs executive said she agreed with Treasury Secretary Yellen that the U.S. defaulting on its debt obligations would have “catastrophic consequences for the U.S. economy.” Moreover, she cautioned that there would be “a huge ripple effect” if the Treasury stops making some payments.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Yellen said at a press conference ahead of a G7 meeting in Japan that a default would &#8220;risk undermining U.S. global economic leadership and raise questions about our ability to defend our national security interests.&#8221;</p>
<p>A lawmaker said this week that a default poses <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/lawmaker-warns-us-default-risks-dollars-reserve-currency-status-exploitation-by-china-and-russia/">risks</a> to the U.S. dollar&#8217;s reserve currency status. Federal Reserve Chairman <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fed-chair-warns-of-uncertain-and-adverse-consequences-of-us-debt-default-wed-be-in-uncharted-territory/">Jerome Powell</a> has also warned of &#8220;uncertain and adverse consequences&#8221; from the U.S. defaulting on its debt obligations.</p>

Trump, who is also running for president in 2024, stressed that letting the U.S. default is “better than what we’re doing right now because we’re spending money like drunken sailors.”</strong></p>
<h2>Donald Trump&#8217;s Advice on U.S. Default</h2>
<p>Former President and 2024 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has advised Republican lawmakers to let the United States default on its debt obligations if Democrats do not agree to spending cuts.</p>
<p>Trump was asked during a televised CNN Town Hall on Wednesday for his advice to Republicans on the possibility of the U.S. defaulting on its debt obligations. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I say to the Republicans out there — congressmen, senators — if they don’t give you massive cuts, you’re going to have to do a default.</p></blockquote>
<p>The former U.S. president added: “I don’t believe they’re going to do a default because I think the Democrats will absolutely cave, because you don’t want to have that happen.”</p>
<p>Trump, who announced in November last year that he is running for president again in 2024, stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>But, it’s better than what we’re doing right now because we’re spending money like drunken sailors.</p></blockquote>
<p>When pressed to clarify if he believes that &#8220;the U.S. should default if the White House does not agree to the spending cuts,&#8221; Trump promptly answered:</p>
<blockquote><p>Well, you might as well do it now, because you’ll do it later. Because we have to save this country. Our country is dying. Our country is being destroyed by stupid people, by very stupid people.</p></blockquote>
<p>Trump has issued multiple warnings regarding the U.S. economy and the U.S. dollar in recent months. He claimed last month that the USD is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/former-president-donald-trump-says-us-dollar-is-crashing-warns-were-very-close-to-world-war-iii/">crashing</a> and &#8220;will soon no longer be the world standard.&#8221; He also warned that &#8220;we are very close&#8221; to World War III.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has informed lawmakers that the Treasury Department may not be able to pay all of the government’s bills <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/treasury-secretary-yellen-warns-us-could-default-on-its-debt-by-june-1/">as early as June 1</a> “if Congress does not raise or suspend the debt limit before that time.”</p>

The SEC is reportedly looking into potential violations of federal securities law.</strong></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Marathon&#8217;s Montana Mining Facility Under SEC Investigation, Company Receives Second Subpoena</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Marathon Digital Holdings (Nasdaq: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-MARA/">MARA</a>) was served with a second subpoena on April 10, 2023, following a previous subpoena in October 2020. The company disclosed the news in its May 10 <a href="https://ir.marathondh.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001493152-23-016184/0001493152-23-016184.pdf">SEC filing</a>, revealing that it has now received a total of two subpoenas.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to the filing, the subpoena requires the company and certain executives to produce documents and communications related to the Hardin, Montana data center facility, which was previously described in a Form 8-K dated October 13, 2020. Marathon said it is fully cooperating with the investigation, and will provide the requested information to the SEC.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The company received an additional subpoena from the SEC on April 10, 2023, relating to, among other things, transactions with related parties,” Marathon added. “We understand that the SEC may be investigating whether or not there may have been any violations of the federal securities law. We are cooperating with the SEC.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Marathon’s subpoena comes on the heels of the company&#8217;s announcement of a partnership with Abu Dhabi-based Zero Two. The two firms are planning to build two large-scale immersion-cooled crypto-mining facilities. However, the company&#8217;s shares have taken a hit, with a 5.14% drop in the past day and a 6.78% decline over the last five days against the U.S. dollar. Despite the recent drop, Marathon&#8217;s stock has been performing well this year, with a 184.41% increase in 2023.</p>
