<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While last year’s downtimes and the seven major exploits the chain experienced in 2022 led to a severe decline in its TVL, the year so far has been different. Per <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Solana" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Messari</a>, Solana’s TVL at the beginning of the year was $209.25 million. Growing by 217% since then, the Layer 1 (L1) network’s TVL was $664 million at press time. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Solana registered a TVL uptick in the last month, other top L1 networks Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Avalanche, saw respective declines of 13%, 6%, and 10%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regarding Layer 2 (L2) scaling solutions, Arbitrum saw its TVL fall by 7% in the last month. Optimism, however, fared better as the rollup network logged a 10% jump in its TVL during the same period. </span></p>
<h4><b>State of Solana</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite registering a TVL growth in the last month, user activity on Solana suffered a shortfall. Per data from </span><a href="https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/projects/solana" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Token Terminal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the network registered a 5% decline in active user count in the past 30 days. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For context, user activity on the chain has been on a steady decline in the last year, primarily due to the several downtimes and exploits the network suffered during that period. In the past 180 days, daily active user count dropped by 15%. In the last 12 months, this fell by over 50%.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 1.6% drop in active user activity on Solana last week reduced trading volume across the decentralized exchanges hosted on the chain. zkSync, with a much lower TVL, exceeded Solana in DEX volume during that period, on-chain data revealed.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Zk Sync did more dex volume than Solana last week and Pulse Chain did more than Avalanche <a href="https://t.co/4clej4w12q" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/4clej4w12q</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, a silver lining exists. While user activity and trading volume suffered a decline, Solana’s transaction fees and network revenue surged. Per data from <a href="https://analytics.solscan.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Solscan</a>, network fees charged for successful non-vote transactions climbed to a high of 53.06 SOL on 2 August. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it has since declined, this represented a significant growth in network fees from 31.64 SOL recorded a month ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A broader assessment of all network fees revealed a 50% jump in the last month. Solana also saw a corresponding hike in revenue during the same period. On an annualized basis, the L1’s revenue has gone up by 21%.</span></p>

<p>Ryan Salame, the former Co-Chief Executive of FTX Digital Markets, has reportedly held talks with federal prosecutors regarding a plea deal in connection with the charges stemming from the crypto exchange’s collapse. News of the plea deal negotiation comes more than three months after the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/fbi-raids-former-ftx-ryan-salames-house/">raided</a> Salame’s house in Potomac, Maryland. </p>



<h2><strong>FTX’s Ryan Salame Could Plead Guilty Next Month</strong></h2>



<p>People familiar with the matter revealed that Ryan Salame could plead guilty to charges related to FTX as soon as next month, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-08/ex-ftx-executive-salame-talking-to-prosecutors-about-plea-deal#xj4y7vzkg" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a> reported earlier today. The charges will likely include criminal offenses in relation to the bankrupt crypto exchange and campaign finance law violations. Salame is one of the few executives who haven’t faced any charges following FTX’s collapse in November last year. </p>



<p>It is unclear if the former FTX executive’s plea deal with the Department of Justice would require him to testify against his former boss Sam Bankman-Fried, who is facing multiple charges, including wire fraud, securities fraud, bribery allegations, campaign finance laws violations, etc. Salame’s former co-workers, including ex-Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison and FTX co-founder Gary Wang, have already entered plea agreements with the Justice Department and will testify in the lawsuit against Bankman-Fried.</p>



<p>Salame was known to be a prolific political donor and previously made headlines for donating as much as $24 million to Republican candidates in the United States. His political campaign contributions came under scrutiny last month after federal prosecutors initiated an investigation over potential campaign finance laws violations in relation to the political campaign of his girlfriend, Michelle Bond, who was a congressional candidate in 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Buy &amp; Burn program will help to increase the value of RLB tokens by reducing the supply. As more RLB tokens are bought and burned, the supply will decrease, which will make the tokens more scarce and valuable.</p>

<p>These are all great changes that will benefit RLB holders.

On-chain Indicators Point to Short-Term Rally 16"><ul>
<li>BTC recorded its highest daily active address count on 2 August.</li>
<li>The recent increase in network activity, surge in loss-making transactions, and growing negative sentiment are all indicators of a short-term price rally for Bitcoin.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of daily active addresses that trade Bitcoin [BTC] has surged in August, reaching a three-month high of 1.07 million on 2 August, data from Santiment showed. Still growing, the number of addresses that have completed BTC transactions today was 1.03 million. </span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">📈 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">#Bitcoin</a>&#39;s address activity has surged to its highest level in 3.5 months in August. This utility increase, combined with major loss transactions &amp; negative sentiment, is a strong sign that a short-term (at minimum) <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">$BTC</a> price bounce is more probable. <a href="https://t.co/5PzjYROX5T" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/5PzjYROX5T</a> <a href="https://t.co/G2tevAWdSM" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/G2tevAWdSM</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the number of daily active BTC addresses increases, the number of transactions involving the cryptocurrency that has resulted in losses has also grown. An examination of the coin’s ratio of daily on-chain transaction volume in profit to loss revealed this. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This indicator measures the value of an asset’s transactions that return profits to the value of its transactions resulting in a loss within a single day. When the indicator logs an uptick and is above the zero line, market participants are making more profits than losses. Conversely, market participants are recording more losses when this metric returns a value below zero. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BTC’s ratio of daily on-chain transaction volume in profit to loss was -0.161 at press time, suggesting that more BTC trades returned losses at the time of writing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, weighted sentiment remains negative as the coin continues to linger in a narrow price range. Per Santiment, BTC’s weighted sentiment was -0.25 at press time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Santiment:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This utility increase, combined with major loss transactions &amp; negative sentiment, is a strong sign that a short-term (at minimum) $BTC price bounce is more probable.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But is the king coin ready for such a leap?</span></p>
<h4><b>Finally, a reason to smile?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite facing strong resistance at $30,000 and trading in a tight range for the past two months, BTC holders have been reluctant to sell their coins, according to an analysis of exchange activity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A look at its exchange reserves on a 30-day moving average revealed a 1.4% decline in the last month. This metric tracks the total number of BTCs held within cryptocurrency exchanges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the value of BTC’s exchange reserves rises, it indicates higher selling pressure as more coins are being forwarded to exchanges for onward sales. On the other hand, a decline suggests a reduction in BTC distribution and is often a precursor to a price uptick. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition the declining number of  BTC sell-offs, most traders are betting on a price increase.. This is evident from the funding rates on the futures market across leading exchanges, which show that longs outnumber shorts. This is a positive sign, as it suggests that many traders believe that the price of Bitcoin will rise in the short term.</span></p>

<p>While these on-chain indicators hint at a price growth in the short-term, it remains important to pay attention to macro factors that might affect BTC&#8217;s price negatively.</p>

<ul><li>Core Scientific is poised to exit its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings following a $77 million deal with Bitmain.&nbsp;</li><li>Bitmain will acquire a $54 million stake in the bankrupt Bitcoin miner in exchange for 27,000 Antminers.&nbsp;</li><li>Crypto platform Anchorage Digital will also take a multi-million dollar stake in the Bitcoin mining firm.&nbsp;</li><li>Core Scientific’s share price gained more than 4% following the latest developments.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Core Scientific, the largest publicly listed crypto mining firm by hashrate, is set to exit its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings following a $77 million deal with the world’s largest crypto mining equipment maker Bitmain. The deal was disclosed in a <a href="https://cases.stretto.com/public/X217/12024/PLEADINGS/1202408082380000000050.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">filing</a> with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas earlier today.</p>



<h2><strong>Core Scientific (CORZ) Stock Gains 4%</strong></h2>



<p>As per the latest court filing, <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/core-scientific-new-contracts-bankruptcy/">Core Scientific</a> has entered into an agreement to acquire 27,000 of Bitmain’s Antminer S19j XP mining rigs for $77.1 million. In exchange for the miners, Bitmain will receive $23 million cash and equity worth $54 million in the Texas-based crypto mining giant. </p>



<p>Crypto platform Anchorage Digital, which is owed $29 million by Core Scientific, will have its claim completely converted into equity in the restructured company. The other option for creditors of the bankrupt crypto miner is to take on secured debt at 80% of the value of their claims.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Creditors, including BlockFi, Barings, MassMutual Asset Finance, BaringsTrinity Capital, and 36th Street Capital Partners, are reportedly going to take on secured debt in the emerging company. When Core filed for bankruptcy in December last year, these creditors held a debt exposure of approximately $193 million.&nbsp;</p>



<p>B.Riley, which extended a loan of $70 million to Core Scientific as part of a bankruptcy financing deal earlier this year, is expected to provide $25 million in new financing. The investment bank will also convert the outstanding amount of the loan to a delayed term loan. The bankrupt crypto miner is also negotiating a $55 million equity rights offering for common stockholders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reorganization plan is largely contingent on approval from Core Scientific’s creditors as well as the relevant bankruptcy court. The latest developments led to a 4% hike in the company’s share price. At the time of writing, Core’s stock was trading at $0.95.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Binance is the first crypto exchange to receive both a Bitcoin Services Provider license (BSP) and a non-provisional Digital Assets Services Provider license (DASP) in El Salvador. </li><li>El Salvador is the 18th market license crypto&#8217;s largest centralized exchange by market cap. </li><li>The country was also the first to approve Bitcoin (BTC) as a legal tender in 2021, making headlines around the globe and drawing scrutiny from regulators like the IMF.</li></ul>



<p>Binance can now offer fully regulated Bitcoin and digital asset services in El Salvador after securing two licenses from the country&#8217;s central bank and digital assets regulators. </p>



<p>The company said in an <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/binance-becomes-first-fully-licensed-crypto-exchange-in-el-salvador-348306456147004721" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/binance-becomes-first-fully-licensed-crypto-exchange-in-el-salvador-348306456147004721" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official announcement</a> that it received a Bitcoin Services Provider license (BSP) from the Central Reserve Bank (Banco Central de Reserva) and the first non-provisional Digital Assets Services Provider license (DASP) from the National Commission of Digital Assets (Comisión Nacional de Activos Digitales). </p>



<p>Min Lin, Binance Head of Latin America said both licenses were secured after months of hard work and liaising with local regulators. Indeed, Binance had a presence in El Salvador but only through a third-party entity. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We are grateful to the Central Reserve Bank and the National Commission of Digital Assets. Their blockchain technology adoption has created a thriving sector in El Salvador that proves security and innovation are complementary assets. Now, it joins countries around the world that have granted Binance a regulatory license.</p></blockquote>



<p>Approval in El Salvador marks the 18th market to welcome Binance and issue a crypto license to the company. </p>



<h2>El Salvador&#8217;s Nascent Crypto Economy</h2>



<p>El Salvador became the first country in the world to approve Bitcoin as a legal tender. At the time, President Nayib Bukele drew scrutiny from international regulators like the IMF for legalizing the so-called digital gold. </p>



<p>Two years later, President Bukele signed the Digital Securities Act into law, further solidifying his administration&#8217;s crypto-savvy approach. The country is also exploring volcanic energy as a power source for <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/tether-el-salvador-1-billion-btc-mining/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/tether-el-salvador-1-billion-btc-mining/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin mining</a>. </p>



<p>Bitfinex Securities &#8211; an exchange offering tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) &#8211; received a provisional Digital Assets Services Provider license in April as the country continues to open its borders for crypto businesses. </p>

<p>Paradigm research partner and head of security, Sam (@samczsun), unveiled a joint effort between auditors, security professionals, and white hat hackers aimed at providing assistance during crypto hacks. </p>



<p>The working solution &#8211; a telegram bot &#8211; arrives amid multi-million rescue missions for Curve Finance, one of DeFi&#8217;s largest exchanges which was recently exploited for $73.5 million in cryptocurrencies. </p>



<p>According to Sam, SEAL 911 allows anyone to contact a professional from a pool of veteran security experts in emergency situations.

<h2>Curve Recovers Loot From Vyper-Pool Exploit</h2>



<p>DeFi&#8217;s community remains watchful even as Curve Finance recovers almost 75% of exploited liquidity. CRV&#8217;s price dropped along with TVL on Ethereum&#8217;s DeFi scene after attackers leveraged a reentrancy vulnerability to steal millions from crypto pools on Curve&#8217;s decentralized exchange. </p>



<p>Over a week later, the DEX <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/52-million-recovered-curve-finance-heist/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/52-million-recovered-curve-finance-heist/" rel="noreferrer noopener">recovered</a> $52.3 million out of $73.5 million stolen in late July/early August. CRV&#8217;s price also buoyed back to 60 cents after dropping to 49 cents following the exploit. </p>



<p>Curve is offering 10% of the outstanding funds &#8211; worth $1.8 million &#8211; as a bounty in return for information about the exploiter. </p>

<p>Huobi Global is aiming to become the first exchange to support the launch of Paypal’s new dollar-pegged stablecoin, PYUSD. The crypto exchange plans to list PYUSD on its trading platform soon and start by offering PYUSD/USDT trading pairs to its users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Huobi’s push to add the newly launched stablecoin came just a day after customers withdrew $49 million worth of stablecoins from the crypto exchange, which translated to over 33% of its stablecoin balance. The significant outflow of stables came amid reports of several Huobi executives being arrested in China</p>



<h2><strong>Huobi Global To Offer Zero Trading Fees On PYUSD Pairs</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.huobi.com/support/en-us/detail/44945804382445" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a> by Huobi Global, PYUSD/USDT trading pairs will be offered with zero trading fee permanently. The crypto exchange stated that it would list the new stablecoin as soon as its market circulation and liquidity conditions become favorable. The exchange reiterated that it aimed to become the first to offer&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Huobi has always been committed to maintaining friendly communication with high-quality projects and institutions in blockchain industry to jointly promote the development of the industry.”</p><cite>Huobi Global</cite></blockquote>



<p>Following the launch of PYUSD on August 7, Tron founder Justin Sun, who holds a considerable stake in Huobi Global, invited PayPal to issue its new stablecoin on the Tron network. Sun took to Twitter to highlight Tron’s efficiency and secureness that facilitated transactions worth $12 billion every day. “Mutual benefits await in the digital payment landscape. Let&#8217;s collaborate for a thriving ecosystem,” Sun added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PayPal <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/paypal-usd-pegged-stablecoin-on-ethereum/">unveiled</a> its PYUSD stablecoin on August 7 six months after it halted its development due to the regulatory crackdown on crypto in the United States. The new stablecoin will be issued by Paxos Trust Company, which will be 100% backed by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term U.S. treasury bonds, and similar cash equivalents. Paxos Trust Co. previously minted Binance’s BUSD stablecoins.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>A group of FTX customers has brought a class action suit against the exchange’s law firm.&nbsp;</li><li>Fenwick &amp; West LLP is being sued for allegedly aiding fraud through its legal advice to the crypto exchange.&nbsp;</li><li>The law firm has been accused of setting up entities used to perpetrate fraud and structuring transactions to avoid scrutiny.&nbsp;</li><li>Sam Bankman-Fried previously cited legal advice from Fenwick &amp; West to bolster his defense.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Fenwick &amp; West LLP, the California-based law firm that served as the primary outside counsel for FTX, is being sued by the bankrupt crypto exchange’s customers. The customers have brought a class action lawsuit against the law firm for its alleged role in aiding fraud through the legal advice it provided to the crypto exchange before its collapse last year.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Fenwick Was Aware Of FTX’s Shady Business Practices?</strong></h2>



<p><strong> </strong>A group of FTX customers filed a class action lawsuit against the exchange in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, though the plaintiffs plan to transfer it to the Southern District of Florida, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/ftx-law-firm-fenwick-faces-second-lawsuit-by-crypto-customers-2023-08-07/" rel="nofollow noopener">Reuters</a> reported earlier today. Earlier this year, a judicial panel <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/judicial-panel-consolidates-ftx-lawsuits/">ordered</a> the consolidation of multiple lawsuits related to the bankrupt exchange in Miami where they would be heard by Federal Judge Michael Moore. </p>



<p>The latest complaint alleged that the services extended to FTX by Fenwick &amp; West went beyond what a law firm usually provides to its clients. The crypto exchange’s customers accused the law firm of setting up “shadowy entities” that were used by founder Sam Bankman-Fried and his inner circle to commit fraud and structure the exchange’s transactions in ways that allowed them to circumvent regulatory scrutiny.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“When asked by FTX Group executives for counsel, Fenwick lawyers were eager to craft not only creative, but illegal strategies.” </p><cite>Complaint against Fenwick &amp; West LLP</cite></blockquote>



<p>The customers further alleged that through its unique position and proximity to FTX’s operations, Fenwick &amp; West was aware of the exchange’s complicated organizational structure, lack of internal controls, and dubious business practices. The class action lawsuit is the second FTX-related legal matter to hit the law firm. Earlier this year, Sam Bankman-Fried attempted to subpoena Fenwick to prove that he was acting on legal advice provided by the law firm during his stint as the exchange’s Chief Executive.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>PayPal is set to launch its own dollar-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum called PayPal USD (PYUSD).&nbsp;</li><li>The new stablecoin will be issued by former BUSD issuer Paxos Trust Company.&nbsp;</li><li>The fintech giant aims to establish itself in the growing digital asset space with PYUSD.&nbsp;</li><li>PYUSD comes just days after a key stablecoin bill was cleared by the U.S. House Financial Services Committee.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>American fintech giant PayPal is set to launch its own stablecoin on Ethereum. The payment services company announced earlier today that its dollar-pegged PYUSD stablecoin would be 100% backed by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term U.S. Treasuries, and similar cash equivalents. With its ERC-20 stablecoin debut, PayPal is looking to venture into the growing digital asset space.</p>



<h2><strong>Paxos Trust Co. Will Issue PayPal’s PYUSD Stablecoin</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2023-08-07-PayPal-Launches-U-S-Dollar-Stablecoin" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> from PayPal, the new PYUSD stablecoin will be issued by Paxos Trust Company, the New York-based blockchain firm that minted Binance’s BUSD stablecoin till February this year. Paxos is licensed by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), which also issued a BitLicense to PayPal in June last year. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Our commitment to responsible innovation and compliance, and our track record delivering new experiences to our customers, provides the foundation necessary to contribute to the growth of digital payments through PayPal USD.&#8221; </p><cite>Dan Schulman, president and CEO, PayPal</cite></blockquote>



<p>PYUSD will initially be made available to U.S.-based PayPal customers, who will be able to purchase it through the payments giant’s online platform. Users will be able to transfer the stablecoin between the platform and compatible external wallets, use it for online purchases, and convert it to one of PayPal’s supported cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Starting September 2023, Paxos Trust Co. will publish monthly Reserve Reports for PYUSD outlining the composition of the reserves backing the stablecoin. The stablecoin issuer will also publish third-party attestation of the value of the reserve assets. The attestation itself will be carried out per the standards set by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).&nbsp;</p>



<p>News of PayPal’s stablecoin comes nearly six months after the fintech giant <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/paypal-halts-stablecoin-crypto-crackdown/">halted</a> stablecoin development following the crackdown on crypto by regulators in the United States. At the time, Paxos was being probed by the NYDFS for unknown reasons. </p>



<p>The Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act of 2023, which was <a href="https://www.nasaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NASAA-Letter-to-Congress-Regarding-H.R.-4766-Clarity-for-Payment-Stablecoins-Act-of-2023.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">cleared</a> by the U.S. House Financial Services Committee last month may have played a role in PYUSD’s launch. Patrick McHenry, Chairman of the Financial Services Committee, said in a statement earlier today that the stablecoin bill brought much-needed clarity surrounding the regulation of stablecoins and other digital assets. </p>
