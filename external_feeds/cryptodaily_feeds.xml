			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Google Cloud has introduced an initiative specifically designed for Web3 startups, leveraging strategic partnerships with Alchemy, Aptos, Base, Celo, Flow, Hedera, Nansen, Near, Polygon, Solana, and Thirdweb.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Web3 Startup Program is aimed at forming a wider initiative from the Alphabet subsidiary to deliver technical tools and cloud services to firms looking to scale. The program thus welcomes Series A-stage companies building blockchain-based protocols and tech stacks.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"Our goal is to enable Web3 builders with reliable, scalable, and sustainable infrastructure on which to build their applications. We want to make Google Cloud the first choice for every Web3 startup and developer to help launch and scale their business," shares James Tromans, Head of Web3 Engineering at Google Cloud.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">The program will primarily feature credits which startups may receive (up to $2,000 in Google Cloud credits, valid for two years), as well as added benefits in terms of access to major blockchain events such as Paris Blockchain Week, Consensus, and TOKEN2049 Singapore. Google has also announced its participation with the latter event.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">For startups who have already obtained seed funding, up to $200,000 worth of cloud credits (for both Google Cloud and Firebase) for over two years is available, with an additional $12,000 in Google Cloud Enhanced Support credits. Sdtartups will also be able to operate more seamlessly with a year worth of Google Workspace Business Plus access. Participating partners in the program who will offer $1 million each for startups in either fiat amounts or tokens include Aptos, Celo, Flow, HBAR Foundation, Near, and Solana Foundation.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Polygon Ventures, the venture capital arm of Polygon, will provide $3 million in funding for seeded firms, while Coinbase' infrastructure arm, Base, will grant priority reviews for qualifying startups. Coinbase Ventures, on the other hand, will link participating startups to its listing teams, with support for networking with relevant venture capital firms. Alchemy will also be offering $10,000 in credits, alongside VIP support and gasless contract deployment through Thirdweb.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Web3 startups accepted into the program will be subject to certain requirements and restrictions. A "Start Tier" is available for pre-seed companies less than five years old, while a "Scale Tier" caters to those less than ten years old with verified funding up through Series A. Participants will have access to Google Cloud services, Web3 features, and partner offerings at significantly discounted prices.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Nansen CEO Alex Svanevik shared optimism on the prospects of Google Cloud helping out with scaling Web3, stating that:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"We [Nansen] are able to provide real-time intelligence to level the crypto playing field."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Despite entering a competitive field of Web3 infrastructure providers, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft's Azure, and Chainstack, Google Cloud aims to become the first choice for Web3 startups and developers. Google Cloud has been active in Web3 product development for several years. It previously launched the Blockchain Node Engine, a fully managed node-hosting service, and assembled a dedicated Web3 team of product managers and software engineers in 2022 to bring specialized products to the market for the Web3 community.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Following more than two years of intensive work, the crypto industry and the EU policymakers can jointly breathe a sigh of relief as the 20th of April marked the final Plenary vote of the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation or &ldquo;MiCA&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Implementing these new rules will provide much-needed clarity for all the crypto projects that target the EU market or want to do so in the future. The European Crypto Initiative (EUCI) welcomes this vital landmark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not many people know the story of EUCI and how our organisation started as a reaction to the Commission&rsquo;s legislative proposal on MiCA. Back then, I read it, and I jumped on a call with Marina Markezic and Florian Glatz, who were heading the local blockchain organisations in their home countries.</p>
<p>We decided right away that we needed to get involved in the process and help shape the regulation in a way that would accommodate the particularities of the industry. So now it felt incredible to observe the final discussions around MiCA in Plenary and then the text getting voted after all this time,&rdquo; shared Simon Polrot, co-founder and President of EUCI.</p>

MiCA&rsquo;s Effects Are Already Observable
<p>Even before the publication of MiCA&rsquo;s text in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) at the end of June, which will bring the application of the regulation a step forward, EUCI has already started to observe its practical effects.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are in a beneficial position of having a broader overview of the developments across the whole of the EU, meaning that we already observe the day-to-day differences on a member-state level caused by MiCA,&rdquo; shares Marina Markezic, EUCI&rsquo;s co-founder and Operational Manager.</p>

<p>Markezic continues to say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We now see enthusiasm within the industry that was missing in previous years - it is caused, on the one hand, by the expected legal clarity that will follow from MiCA&rsquo;s application, but on the other, some member-states that previously didn&rsquo;t enjoy much interest from crypto projects might have a chance to prepare for MiCA&rsquo;s implementation and become desirable destinations for CASPs licensing activities almost overnight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>EUCI reached out to experts from member states who shared their observations:</p>
In Italy:
<p>For a wide range of tokens that are not financial instruments, MiCA will exclude the application of national rules on financial products and prospectus obligations that scope more use cases than MiFID II prescribes.</p>
<p>According to Francesco Paolo Patti, a ​​Law Professor at Bocconi University and European Law Institute Council Member, MiCA will allow Italian start-ups to launch crypto-asset-related projects according to precise rules.</p>
<p>Further, it will enable the implementation of organisational and prudential requirements currently unknown to Italian CASPs. It will also put these service providers under the control of independent national authorities. The establishment of the Italian CASP register has been the first regulatory step, and MiCA will now provide a comprehensive legal framework and the establishment of new compliance practices.</p>
In France:
<p>The industry and the trade associations are cautious about the 18-month period during which many implementing measures will be developed - the so-called &ldquo;Level 2&rdquo; texts.</p>
<p>According to William O&rsquo;Rorke, Partner at ORWL Avocats, MiCA&rsquo;s adoption is welcomed by the French crypto asset industry as the applicable regulation in the country is already strong. More than 70 actors registered are registered as DASPs, and an approval procedure (similar to MiCA) has existed in France since 2020.</p>
MiCA Has Been Approved; Now What?
<p>&ldquo;Opposite to popular belief, the work on a regulation only begins with its final vote,&rdquo; shares Florian Glatz, another one of MiCA&rsquo;s co-founders, &ldquo;as this milestone and the subsequent OJEU publication only pave the way for the actual work in defining and applying the adopted rules.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Defining and applying MiCA would be achieved through the so-called Level 2 measures that European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) must develop within a specific period following the Regulation&rsquo;s publication in the OJEU. In a nutshell, these are supplementing measures delegated to said authorities to clarify further how the legislation will be implemented.</p>
<p>In the case of MiCA, the competent authorities are the European Banking Authority (EBA), the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European Commission. The topics these agencies have to clarify include distinguishing between crypto assets under MiCA and financial instruments under MiFID II. There are deadlines for those Level 2 acts under MiCA, ranging from 12 to 18 months after the regulation&rsquo;s application date.</p>
The International Scene
<p>International standard-setting bodies such as IOSCO, an association of national securities regulators, and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) will also have an important role to play in shaping and developing common principles for regulating the sector at a global level. This includes significant work on areas such as DeFi, which policymakers are still trying to wrap their heads around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ever since the finalisation of trilogue negotiations on MiCA in Autumn 2022, our attention has shifted primarily to the work done by international standard-setting bodies such as FSB and IOSCO. Their insights and reports will influence future MiCA reviews, but also the development of crypto regulations in other jurisdictions,&rdquo; adds Polrot.</p>

<p>Examples of international bodies&rsquo; publication roadmaps include IOSCO&rsquo;s work on crypto and digital assets, which will be led by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and is expected to conclude towards the end of 2023. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will oversee IOSCO&rsquo;s decentralised finance working group that is expected to publish a report on DeFi at the end of the year, which will also contain specific policy recommendations.</p>
Is MiCA II Coming?
<p>According to Glatz:</p>

<p>&ldquo;As much as we&rsquo;d like to say that the work on regulating the crypto asset industry in the EU is done, there are plenty of indications that the second iteration of MiCA could become a reality very soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His words are further supported by Commissioner McGuinness&rsquo; statement during the Plenary debate on the 19th of April that the Commission could accompany its first evaluation report for MiCA, due 18 months after it enters into force, with a legislative proposal reviewing MiCA&rsquo;s scope. MiCA II is expected to address DeFi, lending and staking, NFTs, and crypto-assets with no identifiable issuer.</p>
MiCA&rsquo;s International Impact
<p>When asked about MiCA&rsquo;s expected influence on an international level, Markezic shares that no other jurisdiction will have as much clarity as the EU. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy to imagine that other jurisdictions will be significantly influenced by MiCA&rsquo;s effect&rdquo;, says Markezic, adding that this trend is already observable in the UK through their current work on regulating crypto assets.</p>

<p>"In any case, EUCI will continue following all upcoming EU regulations affecting crypto and will work towards shaping them as much as possible in a way that benefits the industry and the European economy as a whole while at the same time providing consumers with the necessary trust and protection - just as we&rsquo;ve been doing for years," concludes Markezic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The European Crypto Initiative (EUCI) is a Brussels-based advocacy organisation that aims to shape EU regulations to favour open, permissionless and decentralised applications that leverage blockchain technology. EUCI&rsquo;s work is supported by the Ethereum Foundation, Maker DAO and the Interchain Foundation. </p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following more than two years of intensive work, the crypto industry and the EU policymakers can jointly breathe a sigh of relief as the 20th of April marked the final Plenary vote of the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation or &ldquo;MiCA&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Implementing these new rules will provide much-needed clarity for all the crypto projects that target the EU market or want to do so in the future. The European Crypto Initiative (EUCI) welcomes this vital landmark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not many people know the story of EUCI and how our organisation started as a reaction to the Commission&rsquo;s legislative proposal on MiCA. Back then, I read it, and I jumped on a call with Marina Markezic and Florian Glatz, who were heading the local blockchain organisations in their home countries.</p>
<p>We decided right away that we needed to get involved in the process and help shape the regulation in a way that would accommodate the particularities of the industry. So now it felt incredible to observe the final discussions around MiCA in Plenary and then the text getting voted after all this time,&rdquo; shared Simon Polrot, co-founder and President of EUCI.</p>

MiCA&rsquo;s Effects Are Already Observable
<p>Even before the publication of MiCA&rsquo;s text in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) at the end of June, which will bring the application of the regulation a step forward, EUCI has already started to observe its practical effects.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are in a beneficial position of having a broader overview of the developments across the whole of the EU, meaning that we already observe the day-to-day differences on a member-state level caused by MiCA,&rdquo; shares Marina Markezic, EUCI&rsquo;s co-founder and Operational Manager.</p>

<p>Markezic continues to say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We now see enthusiasm within the industry that was missing in previous years - it is caused, on the one hand, by the expected legal clarity that will follow from MiCA&rsquo;s application, but on the other, some member-states that previously didn&rsquo;t enjoy much interest from crypto projects might have a chance to prepare for MiCA&rsquo;s implementation and become desirable destinations for CASPs licensing activities almost overnight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>EUCI reached out to experts from member states who shared their observations:</p>
In Italy:
<p>For a wide range of tokens that are not financial instruments, MiCA will exclude the application of national rules on financial products and prospectus obligations that scope more use cases than MiFID II prescribes.</p>
<p>According to Francesco Paolo Patti, a ​​Law Professor at Bocconi University and European Law Institute Council Member, MiCA will allow Italian start-ups to launch crypto-asset-related projects according to precise rules.</p>
<p>Further, it will enable the implementation of organisational and prudential requirements currently unknown to Italian CASPs. It will also put these service providers under the control of independent national authorities. The establishment of the Italian CASP register has been the first regulatory step, and MiCA will now provide a comprehensive legal framework and the establishment of new compliance practices.</p>
In France:
<p>The industry and the trade associations are cautious about the 18-month period during which many implementing measures will be developed - the so-called &ldquo;Level 2&rdquo; texts.</p>
<p>According to William O&rsquo;Rorke, Partner at ORWL Avocats, MiCA&rsquo;s adoption is welcomed by the French crypto asset industry as the applicable regulation in the country is already strong.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">The latest in the ongoing clash between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and leading U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase comes as Coinbase files a narrow action just yesterday April 24, compelling the SEC to give a &lsquo;yes or no&rsquo; answer to a petition filed last July 2022.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The petition in question contains a list of questions asking for clarity on the nature of securities and how the agency goes about determining whether an asset is a security or not. On top of this, another petition filed just last March 20 asks the agency to exclude staking in its list of securities. The July petition went unanswered for nine months and thus causing Coinbase to file the narrow action in hopes of forcing the agency&rsquo;s response.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal wrote a blog post where he noted that the agency seems to:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">&ldquo;[have] already made up its mind to [categorically] deny [the] petition. But they haven&rsquo;t told the public yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">The SEC&rsquo;s response is important because it would allow Coinbase to challenge them in court and then argue for regulatory clarity.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The increasing significance of regulatory clarity within the cryptocurrency sector stems from several factors that have led Coinbase to file a specific action lawsuit against the SEC. With the prospect of investor protection, clearly defined regulations ensure that investors are protected from fraudulent schemes and practices in the crypto space. In the absence of regulatory clarity, bad actors could exploit loopholes or the lack of enforcement, potentially harming investors.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This also points to Coinbase' legitimacy within the crypto industry, given how regulatory clarity becomes crucial in establishing Coinbase and the the cryptocurrency industry by extension, as a legitimate and viable financial ecosystem.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Proper regulatory frameworks allow businesses to operate within the confines of the law, promoting trust, stability, and long-term growth. If and when regulatory clarity from the SEC is achieved, this will have one optimal effect: a better environment for regulation. Clear regulations would likely encourage innovation by providing a framework that guides the development and adoption of new technologies. In contrast, a lack of clarity may stifle innovation (and competition, given the environment) as businesses become hesitant to invest in new projects or technologies that might be subject to future regulatory scrutiny.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The SEC&rsquo;s brute force approach in dealing with crypto exchanges, as well as its head Gary Gensler&rsquo;s comments, has earned the crypto community&rsquo;s ire. More importantly, the agency has refused to give a proper definition to securities, which is what prompted Coinbase&rsquo;s petitions in the first place. As a backhanded response to these petitions, the SEC slapped Coinbase with a Wells notice last March 22.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">How the SEC will respond to this narrow action will be crucial; it will be a, if not &lsquo;the&rsquo;, defining moment for the nascent crypto sector in the United States. Should things go even further south, Coinbase will be forced to relocate to other countries with a more welcoming environment for crypto.</p>

The funding will be used to support TinyTap&rsquo;s business expansion and accelerate development in the edtech space.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">The investment will enable TinyTap to continue to expand its successful Web2 platform, which already serves over 9.2 million registered members, into an alternative Web3 education system that better values teachers by improving the earning opportunities available to them, and enables parents and communities to support and promote their preferred educational materials.&nbsp;</p><p class="ql-align-justify">TinyTap launched its Web3 strategy in 2022 with two successful auctions of Publisher NFTs, which generated 243 ETH (approximately US$352,000 at times of auction). Publisher NFTs are a new concept introduced by TinyTap to better empower, reward, and incentivize educational content creators and publishers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Each Publisher NFT represents co-publishing rights to one TinyTap Course, which is a curated bundle of educational games made on the TinyTap platform by one teacher in one specific subject. When these NFTs are sold, the proceeds are shared with the Course creators, and the NFT buyers assume the role of co-publishers. In return for promoting and marketing the associated Courses, the buyers share in the benefits generated from co-publishing efforts.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Since the TinyTap Publisher NFTs were auctioned in Q4 2022, the average income to NFT buyers resulting from their co-publishing efforts amounted to approximately 8.2% (or 19.7% annualized) of the purchase price of the Publisher NFTs*.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">The Publisher NFT model is therefore able to simultaneously benefit the creators of educational content, the buyers of the Publisher NFTs, and TinyTap. This frees the creators to focus their efforts on generation of quality content, while TinyTap and the buyers of Publisher NFTs distribute and promote the content.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Misa Matsuzaki owns two Publisher NFTs and earned about $7,823 from November 2022 to March 2024 by co-publishing the associated courses. She commented: &ldquo;TinyTap helps teachers to actualize great ideas into educational content that can be accessed regardless of location &ndash; for example, one of the courses I bought was adapted for Japan. I did the first translation and voice over myself with the help of the TinyTap&nbsp; team. I look forward to seeing how Japan will welcome these exciting new possibilities in education! I would like to see more use cases like TinyTap Publisher NFTs, which are so much more interesting than just having NFTs sitting in our wallet!&ldquo;</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Yogev Shelly, CEO of TinyTap, commented: &ldquo;Our Publisher NFTs genesis auctions demonstrated that the Web3 community is well suited and willing to support educators and educational content via this new powerful and equitable incentive system.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The country of Romania has made its first Web3 move with the launch of a new institutional NFT trading platform.&nbsp;</p>
New Romanian NFT Platform
<p>Romania is welcoming Web3 technology into the country. In the first step of its initiative, the country&rsquo;s National Institute for Research and Development in Informatics (ICI Bucharest) will soon be launching and in-house NFT trading platform called ICI D|Services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The platform launch has been scheduled for April 26 and will provide a bridge between institutions and users in the private and public sectors. However, the platform will primarily function as an NFT marketplace, where individual and institutional customers will be able to mint, manage, and trade NFTs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The platform is being launched with five inaugural NFT collections, which have been designed in collaboration with some popular Romanian sportspersons, organizations, and institutions, namely, the Romanian Olympic and Sports Committee, 18-year-old 100m freestyle swimming world record holder David Popovici, Romanian news agency Agerpres, national philately organization Romfilatelia, and Bucharest&rsquo;s Central University Library.&nbsp;</p>
ICI Bucharest Exploring Web3 Tech
<p>The ICI Bucharest blockchain laboratory coordinator Paul Niculescu-Mizil Gheorghe spoke about the country&rsquo;s efforts to adopt Web3-powered technologies. After focusing on research and development for five years, ICI Bucharest&rsquo;s focus has shifted to actively exploring blockchain technology and the possibilities introduced by Web3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He said,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blockchain technology increases the efficiency of the institutions, to approach solid use cases based on digital asset management, transparency, security in various institutional operations, such as in education, health, transport, land registration, supply chain management.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gheorghe also highlighted the role played by high-value NFTs in recent years, because of their uniqueness and rarity, despite the multitude of roles played by these assets in different use cases. He believes that even national institutions like ICI Bucharest could benefit greatly from these high-value assets.&nbsp;</p>
Initiative Supported By Government Agencies
<p>As the coordinator working between the country&rsquo;s government and the institution's efforts, Gheorghe commended the government for supporting Web3 adoption in the country. He has revealed that both the Romanian Ministry of Research, Innovation, and Digitalization and the Secretariat-General have extended their full support to the NFT marketplace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our institute wants to create a bridge between the young generations and the public institutions values, initiating a comfort zone for the interactions with the digital space.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Like many other countries, Romania has been dabbling in crypto and blockchain since 2020. However, the work on the NFT marketplace started more recently. It was first proposed by the ICI Bucharest in late 2021. The institution then went on to partner with MultiversX around mid-2022 to develop the platform architecture.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s5"> Uwerx is creating waves ahead of its launch. Find out why it has traders dropping Terra and heading towards its presale. Read up on how to be one of these traders and register in the presale to unlock a potentially treasure trove of profits.</p>
<p class="s5">Are you one of the millions that invested in the restarted Terra (LUNA) in hopes of making gains? The network and its token haven&rsquo;t performed up to expectations and you might be frustrated, looking for other avenues.</p>
<p class="s5">Why not look at Uwerx, a project that is going to fundamentally change how the freelancing market operates?</p>
<p class="s9">Terra (LUNA) Disappointing Many</p>
<p class="s5">With a few months left, it will be a year since the original Terra (LUNA) saw one of the worst crashes in crypto history. When Do Kwon, the co-founder of Terra (LUNA) attempted to revive the network by forking and creating a new Terra (LUNA), there were speculations on its rise to former glory.</p>
<p class="s5">But so far, it has been disappointing.</p>
<p class="s5">The forked Terra (LUNA) network kicked off at around $18 but fell sharply. Today trades at around $2.15. The network has overall failed to attract projects and conjecture by analysts put it at around $3.5 this year - if all things go the right way.The jump is a decent 63% increase, but this is a likelihood that is based on an extremely positive outlook for Terra (LUNA).</p>
<p class="s9">Want the Moon? Check Out Uwerx (WERX)</p>
<p class="s5">Terra (LUNA) may not reach the heights expected any time soon. The forked and relaunched network does not carry the market sentiment that the original had pre-fork. For investors, this is a disappointment. Even if it does reach the expected value of 2023, that is just a shadow of its preferred price.</p>
<p class="s5">On the other hand, Uwerx is gearing up to make waves in the industry with its WERX token. Primarily aiming for the freelancing industry and planning to bring about a change that individual service providers have been demanding for years, Uwerx has the right characteristics to dominate the market.</p>
<p class="s5">Some perks Uwerx will offer to the global freelancer community include an industry shattering set of standards:</p>
● Low Charges: Flat 5% in an industry that can charge as high as 20%.
● Transparency: All records, transactions, and dealings are recorded on-chain, and visible to all parties.
● Copyrights Protection: With all tasks recorded on the blockchain, users can showcase verifiable data on their portfolios.
● Payment Release: Payment is released in WERX tokens automatically using smart contracts when a project is completed successfully.
● Ownership By Users: Not only will taxes be cut to zero, the developers will hand over the platform to its users.
<p class="s13">Apart from these, Uwerx also has a few tricks up its sleeve for its tokenomics. Uwerx is dedicating 12.5% of its 750 million WERX tokens in a 25-year-long liquidity lockup after presale &nbsp;to give investors surety of sustainability. Topping it off with a code audit even before its launch (by InterFi Network and Solidproof) goes to show the sincerity of the project team.</p>
<p class="s13">Uwerx is planning to have its presale with 300 million WERX for early birds at a discounted $0.01 price tag. With forecasts that say WERX may go as high as $3 before the summers are over. This presents a good chance for investors to make some real profits, with the token expected to give nearly 30x returns&mdash;much more than Terra (LUNA) might.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Visa, a giant of payment processing, has unveiled some lofty goals for a new crypto endeavour. By using stablecoin payments, Visa could propel crypto into everyday use.</p>
Visa&rsquo;s new stablecoin payments product
<p>Building upon current blockchain technology, Visa&rsquo;s new offering allows users to seamlessly transact using stablecoins, without the need for fiat currency conversions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stablecoins are frequently tied to commodities such as gold or fiat currencies. This quality establishes them as an appealing choice for those seeking to circumvent the instability commonly linked with other cryptocurrencies.</p>
Better payments for businesses and individuals
<p>Visa&rsquo;s emphasis on stablecoin payments underscores a major milestone towards making crypto assets more feasible for the masses. By nixing the requirement to convert into fiat currencies, Visa has smoothed the path for businesses to acclimate to stablecoin payments, while enabling people to incorporate them in their everyday financial dealings.</p>
<p>Stablecoin payments possess advantageous benefits to both businesses and consumers, including expedient and streamlined transactions for companies, and a safe and effortless mode of paying for goods and services for patrons, all without the requirement of bank accounts or credit cards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, stablecoins grant superior security measures and privacy compared to conventional payment methods because of their decentralised blockchain network, impervious to hacking and fraudulent activity.</p>
Regulatory and market challenges
<p>Stablecoin payments come with some challenges, though. Regulatory compliance is a primary worry, considering that stablecoins still lack all-encompassing regulation. Therefore, to avoid legal problems, Visa will need to hammer out potential compliance issues with regulators before release.</p>
<p>Despite stablecoins being engineered to keep a stable value, market volatility remains a hurdle to overcome. The value of these coins can still be jolted by unexpected changes in the market. For Visa, staying updated with market trends and partnering with stablecoin providers will be crucial in reducing the impact of these fluctuations.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Venom, the first Layer-0 blockchain licensed and operated by Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), has officially launched its public testnet after years of development. That milestone represents a significant achievement in Venom's roadmap as it prepares to launch on the mainnet. As part of its growing ecosystem, Venom has also unveiled several in-house developed decentralized applications (dApps).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The Venom Testnet Has Arrived
<p>The testnet has been designed to cater to both ecosystem users and developers, allowing developers to test and debug dApps and blockchain protocols while enabling users to experience them firsthand. The program's primary goal is to promote innovation and community building within the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Developers and users can quickly try out the testnet in two simple steps. First, download the Venom Wallet from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store for mobile devices or as a Google Chrome extension for desktops. Second, users can start testing the Venom ecosystem by claiming a free testnet allocation.</p>
<p>Peter Knez, the Chair of the Venom Foundation Council, said, "We're thrilled to announce the launch of Venom's public testnet, which is a crucial step towards our upcoming mainnet launch. With our highly scalable and reliable asynchronous blockchain, we're confident that developers will be able to build innovative dApps, while users can experience them firsthand."</p>
<p>Developers can build on the asynchronous Venom blockchain, which boasts ultra-fast speeds of up to 100k TPS and dynamic sharding. Those are two core concepts to enhance scalability and network reliability. In addition, Venom has curated a repository of developer documentation to equip developers with the necessary tools and knowledge to begin building.</p>
Plenty of Benefits for Developers
<p>Venom's network boosts interoperability, making it a valuable tool for developers, while its low transaction fees make it user-friendly for global adoption. Several dApps are set to debut on Venom testnet, including Venom Wallet, Venom Scan, VenomPools, Venom Bridge, Venom Stake, Web3.World, WeUp, NFT Mint, and Oasis.Gallery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users can perform transactions and test the native Venom wallet while experiencing these dApps. Launching Venom's public testnet is a crucial milestone in the blockchain industry. It will provide a platform for developers to build innovative dApps, while users can experience them firsthand.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Web3 space is home to some of the most notable projects. However, the true value is typically gained from lesser-known altcoins with huge-growth potential. By getting into the early stages of a project, investors and traders have the ability to get a massive level of growth from their investments, as the project's popularity and momentum can push it forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aave (AAVE) has dipped in value, and Sparklo has gained a massive following from Web3 investors. Today, we will go over why this might be the case.</p>
<p>Aave (AAVE) Dips by 14.7%</p>
<p>On April 20, 2023, Balancer announced that the Aave (AAVE) V3 bbaUSD and wstETH/bb-a-weth Pools went live. This means that the liquidity provision has grown and that the DeFi building blocks are continuing to stack up.</p>
<p>Despite the announcement, the value behind the Aave (AAVE) altcoin has decreased. Specifically, on April 22, 2023, Aave (AAVE) was trading at $70.48. In the last seven days, Aave (AAVE) decreased in value by 14.7%. In the last 30 days, its overall value has been down by 6.8%, and this momentum behind Aave (AAVE) has left investors worried.</p>
<p>Sparklo (SPRK) To Revolutionize Web3 Investments</p>
<p>Sparklo will be an investment platform that enables users the opportunity to make fractionalized investments within silver, gold, and platinum.</p>
<p>This is a process that involves the procedure of minting non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on top of a blockchain, after which they are fractionalized. Investors can then purchase an entire NFT, after which it will be delivered to them, or just make a fractionalized investment in an NFT with an amount they feel comfortable with and can afford.</p>
<p>This makes the otherwise illiquid asset liquid, as a lot more people will be able to gain access to it.</p>
<p>The Future of Web3 Investments In Precious Metals</p>
<p>As experienced cryptocurrency investors know, investing in solid projects at their early stages is where significant gains can be made.</p>
<p>Sparklo will be bringing an alternative-investment platform, specifically made to enable anyone access to the precious metals market.</p>
<p>With a decentralized fractionalized investment and trading platform, anyone will gain the ability to begin investing in silver, gold, and platinum.</p>
<p>The SPRK token is trading at a value of just $0.015. Analysts predict that with the overall momentum of the market, the value can climb 40x in the upcoming months. The project was audited by the InterFi network, and its liquidity will also be locked for 100 years. This in-turn will make it completely safe for investors within the project.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In cryptocurrency, competition among projects is fierce, and the battle for dominance is never-ending. Recently, investors have been pondering whether Conflux (CFX) could overtake Solana (SOL) as the preferred blockchain platform. While there are arguments for both sides, some investors are turning to Collateral Network (COLT) as a potential alternative with its forecasted 3500% price increase and having a current token price of $0.014 in stage 2 of presale.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Conflux (CFX)</p>
<p>According to reports, Conflux (CFX) has good potential for growth in the future due to its unique features, such as its tree-graph structure that allows for faster transactions and its ability to support smart contracts written in Solidity, a popular programming language for Ethereum.</p>
<p>According to social media analytics and other factors, retail investors strongly support the present price surge of Conflux (CFX). This resulted from the two significant advancements of Conflux (CFX).</p>
<p>On February 15th 2023, Conflux (CFX) disclosed that they are working with China Telecom, the country's biggest wireless carrier with more than 390 million mobile subscribers, to create blockchain-based SIM cards. Later this year, this Conflux (CFX) project will debut in Hong Kong before moving to important mainland China cities like Shanghai.</p>
<p>In late January 2023, Conflux (CFX) teamed up with Little Red Book, China's version of Instagram, to make NFT-powered programs available to the social media's 200 million members. The price of Conflux (CFX) rose 90% in response to the news.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Solana (SOL)</p>
<p>Solana (SOL) is another cryptocurrency gaining popularity due to its fast transaction speed and low fees. It&rsquo;s also worth noting that Solana (SOL) has received much attention from investors lately due to its recent price surge.</p>
<p>Recently, Solana (SOL) experienced a network failure that resulted in the freezing of network operations. Solana (SOL) NFT trades increased by almost 9% from the previous week. The Solana (SOL) network is expanding, but the currency price is lagging.</p>
<p>Recently, the price of Solana (SOL) stood at $20.49, a decrease of 1.78% over the previous 30 days. The technical signals for Solana (SOL) also display sell indications, as seen by looking at them. Due to this, specialists predicted that the coin might soon drop below $19.</p>
<p>As of April 4th 2023, the Solana (SOL) price had slightly increased to $25.10 with a circulating supply of 392,373,593 SOL.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Collateral Network (COLT)</p>
<p>Collateral Network (COLT) is a relatively new cryptocurrency that experts have recommended for 2023. According to some predictions, COLT may surge from $0.01 to $0.35 over presale.</p>
<p>Anyone can use their physical assets as security for loans on the Collateral Network (COLT) blockchain crowdlending network. In addition, Collateral Network (COLT) borrowers can get loans without giving up any of their belongings.</p>
<p>Bring a possession that can be used as collateral, such as art, cars, real estate, etc, to Collateral Network (COLT) if you need money. They will authenticate the asset and mint it into a fractionalised NFT that will represent the physical asset, of which the lender community can then purchase pieces of the NFT to raise the funds for the loan. They get an agreed-upon interest rate in exchange every week, which is advantageous for all parties.</p>
<p>You can anticipate receiving payment for your assets on the Collateral Network (COLT) network in BTC, USDC, or any other type of digital currency within 24 hours. Furthermore, since all contract information is stored in the NFT metadata, where it cannot be changed, clarity will also be available on the Collateral Network (COLT) platform, boosting confidence between the lender and the borrower.</p>
<p>The COLT token, which is only worth $0.014 currently in stage 2 of public presale, will be at the centre of Collateral Network (COLT). You can participate in auctions, earn membership benefits, and exercise voting rights for administration by possessing the COLT token. But do not delay, as many experts predict that by the point the presale is over, the coin price will have reached $0.35.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>New comer cryptocurrency, Sparklo (SPRK) continues to make waves in the crypto industry stealing the attention of investors. The project displays an idea and system that shows it has potential as a result, several investors have been engaging in its presale.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though new, Sparklo (SPRK) is ambitious and has proven to be committed to its course. The token is working to secure its place on the list of 'Top 100 cryptocurrencies.'&nbsp; As old cryptocurrencies on the list continue to plummet, they make this ambition more attainable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aptos (APT) Plummets After Unlock&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Crypto.com data, Aptos (APT) fell -6.91% in the last 24 hours to $10.23 at the time of writing.</p>
<p>The impending unlock of 4.5 million APT tokens, which analysts said would boost the selling pressure on the asset, was a major factor in the value decrease. The unlock is estimated to be worth roughly $50 million based on current values, according to DeFillama statistics.</p>
<p>According to data from CryptoSlate, the unlock would bring APT's circulating supply up by 0.5% to 186 million tokens. Between the first three months of the year, the blockchain network has already experienced three unlocks in tranches of 4.5 million each.</p>
<p>Things are not looking well for the layer-1 blockchain network coin right now, and could get worse when the entire unlock is released.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Flare (FLR) Coin suffers Lose as Airdrop Drops&nbsp;</p>
<p>On January 9, at 23:59 UTC, the eagerly anticipated Flare (FLR) token airdrop occurred, causing a significant 83% drawdown during the subsequent 24 hours.</p>
<p>Flare(FLR) started trading in January 2021 and managed to reach an all-time high of $2.26 on May 1 of that same year. Since then, it has been mired in a macro-downtrend that roughly corresponds to larger market events, such as the FTX sell-off in November.</p>
<p>The first sign that trouble was developing came on January 8; an 18% drop that ended the day at $0.451838. On January 9, the selloff resumed, resulting in a 42% loss for the day. Currently Flare (FLR)&nbsp; is down by -0.48%</p>
<p>Sparklo (SPRK) to Release Aptos (APT) and Flare (FLR) on The Top 100 Cryptocurrencies List</p>
<p>Sparklo will be the first blockchain investment trading platform to focus solely on silver, gold, and platinum. Each investment generates and fractionalizes an NFT, which users can then use to invest in other projects.</p>
<p>The silver, gold, and platinum investments will be stored in legally recognized bullion storage facilities monitored by expert vault operators who are among the greatest suppliers of secure transportation and precious metal vault services in the world</p>
<p>Sparklo is now in the first stage of its presale. This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance for cryptocurrency lovers and investors. This ground-breaking initiative, priced at only $0.015 per token, features a revolutionary tokenomics structure that sets it different from the competition. Sparklo is ready to create waves in the crypto industry, with a strong focus on sustainability, security, and scalability.</p>
<p>Investors who participate in the presale have early access to this game-changing digital asset, boosting the possibility of huge returns as the project develops popularity. Sparklo is also supported by a devoted and experienced team of developers and industry professionals that are committed to seeing the project through to completion.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>South Korea&rsquo;s central bank, the Bank of Korea, has been given the green signal to probe crypto firms and operators of virtual assets operating in the country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This go-ahead will allow the bank to access data related to cryptocurrency transactions from exchanges operating in South Korea.&nbsp;</p>
A Landmark Development&nbsp;
<p>The go-ahead given to the Bank of Korea is viewed as a landmark development, given that the central bank holds differing views with the country&rsquo;s financial regulatory authority, the Financial Services Commission (FSC). The Korean Central Bank and the Financial Services Commissions have been at loggerheads regarding jurisdiction over crypto. Crypto regulation has been under discussion in the National Assembly, with the Financial Services Commission submitting that it accepted granting the Bank of Korea authority to probe cryptocurrency firms operating in the country.&nbsp;</p>
At Loggerheads&nbsp;
<p>The National Assembly is currently accepting opinions regarding the Virtual Asset Act from the government. The central bank&rsquo;s authority to request data submissions from crypto firms is also being explored in the act. The Financial Services Commission is set to express its official position regarding the matter at the bill&rsquo;s first subcommittee, which is scheduled to meet on the 25th of April. This could pave the way for the faster implementation of the Virtual Asset Act.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bank of Korea, in its submissions, has stated that it holds the authority to request for data on crypto firms and other digital and virtual asset issuers, specifically for stablecoins. The Bank of Korea stated that it is logical for it to regulate crypto since any potential risk from digital assets could spread to the traditional financial system. Meanwhile, the Financial Services Commission does not want crypto to be viewed on par with the traditional financial system. It added that if the central bank was given the authority to govern crypto and crypto firms, it could send out the message that digital assets were financial assets. In its submission, the Financial Services Commission stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the Virtual Asset Act specifies the inspection right of the Financial Supervisory Service, it will cause the general public to misunderstand that the virtual asset market/business operator is treated the same as the financial market/institution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Financial Services Commission Chair has repeatedly stated that he does not view cryptocurrencies and digital assets as financial instruments.&nbsp;</p>
Crypto Legislation In Limbo&nbsp;
<p>The South Korean government has repeatedly tried to push legislation around cryptocurrencies and crypto firms operating in the country. However, the turf war between the Bank of Korea and the Financial Services Commission has proved to be a major stumbling block. Kim Han-gyu, the Democratic Party lawmaker that proposed the Crypto Assets Act, has stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Financial Services Commission admits that it is necessary for the Bank of Korea to have the right to request data, but it is refusing to include it in the bill.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Financial Services Commission has also come under fire from officials of the Political Affairs Committee, a division of South Korea&rsquo;s State Affairs Commission. Officials from the committee have accused the Financial Services Commission of trying to monopolize its position as a crypto regulator.&nbsp;</p>
South Korea&rsquo;s Crypto Struggles&nbsp;
<p>The crypto space in South Korea has faced several issues over the past year. The problems began with the spectacular collapse of the Terra ecosystem and its associated stablecoin. Terra founder Do Kwon was recently arrested in Montenegro, along with another suspect, Hon Chang Joon. Both South Korea and the United States have requested their extradition. More recently, several staff members from the cryptocurrency exchange Coinone were taken into custody amidst allegations of bribery, breach of trust, and other criminal acts.&nbsp;</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korea&rsquo;s central bank, the Bank of Korea, has been given the green signal to probe crypto firms and operators of virtual assets operating in the country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This go-ahead will allow the bank to access data related to cryptocurrency transactions from exchanges operating in South Korea.&nbsp;</p>
A Landmark Development&nbsp;
<p>The go-ahead given to the Bank of Korea is viewed as a landmark development, given that the central bank holds differing views with the country&rsquo;s financial regulatory authority, the Financial Services Commission (FSC). The Korean Central Bank and the Financial Services Commissions have been at loggerheads regarding jurisdiction over crypto. Crypto regulation has been under discussion in the National Assembly, with the Financial Services Commission submitting that it accepted granting the Bank of Korea authority to probe cryptocurrency firms operating in the country.&nbsp;</p>
At Loggerheads&nbsp;
<p>The National Assembly is currently accepting opinions regarding the Virtual Asset Act from the government. The central bank&rsquo;s authority to request data submissions from crypto firms is also being explored in the act. The Financial Services Commission is set to express its official position regarding the matter at the bill&rsquo;s first subcommittee, which is scheduled to meet on the 25th of April. This could pave the way for the faster implementation of the Virtual Asset Act.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bank of Korea, in its submissions, has stated that it holds the authority to request for data on crypto firms and other digital and virtual asset issuers, specifically for stablecoins. The Bank of Korea stated that it is logical for it to regulate crypto since any potential risk from digital assets could spread to the traditional financial system. Meanwhile, the Financial Services Commission does not want crypto to be viewed on par with the traditional financial system. It added that if the central bank was given the authority to govern crypto and crypto firms, it could send out the message that digital assets were financial assets. In its submission, the Financial Services Commission stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the Virtual Asset Act specifies the inspection right of the Financial Supervisory Service, it will cause the general public to misunderstand that the virtual asset market/business operator is treated the same as the financial market/institution.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Twitter's recent decision to end its legacy verification program has led to users seeking alternative decentralized solutions. Historically, blue checkmarks were given to journalists, celebrities, and government figures for free, as long as they met certain criteria.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">CryptoDaily itself, a crypto news and media publication that has been serving the industry for over five years to date, recently lost its legacy "verified" status on Twitter. The rules for verification have been rotated to accommodate payments, for a rough monthly fee of USD $8 (depends on where you're from). This means that anyone can now apply for the verified status, regardless of stature or integrity: a decision that leaves journalists and publications such as CryptoDaily in the open.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">As the Twitter blue checkmark verification loses its meaning, some users have already made the switch to Bluesky, a platform backed by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. The platform is often touted as the decentralized alternative to Twitter. Dorsey has announced plans for the decentralized social protocol as early as 2019, hiring blockchain developer Jay Graber, who previously worked on ZCash, a privacy-first blockchain protocol. Graber now leads Bluesky as CEO.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Bluesky has been building out what's called the "Authenticated Transport Protocol" or AT Protocol. This protocol creates a layer of interoperability for social media, bridging various decentralized applications across a unified ecosystem. In October, when Bluesky opened the waitlist for its beta, it received 30,000 sign-ups in 48 hours. Despite its bare-bones features, Bluesky is growing in popularity among those who are seeking to move away from Twitter.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Bluesky is joined by other decentralized social media platforms such as Zion, Nostr, and Mastodon, all of which share the core principle of being open platforms built on blockchain-based principles. Zion itself is built over the Bitcoin protocol, while Nostr forms a non-peer to peer chain of clients with tamperproof, censorship-resistant features operating from cryptographic keys and signatures. Mastodon, on the other hand, forms a multi-server network of interoperable "communities" spread across regions and topics.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">On privacy and technology</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Privacy and technological progress have a complex and intertwined relationship. On the one hand, technological progress has enabled new forms of communication, collaboration, and innovation. It has also made our lives more convenient and efficient in many ways. However, this progress has also come at a cost to user privacy.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">It's easier and cheaper to collect, store, and analyze vast amounts of data, whether these are personal or not. What does this imply? Data has become a property, an asset that can be utilized to track different vectors of human life: from activities to interests, to behavior and tendencies. Big technology companies utilize this and sometimes, to the detriment of an unknowing public, exploit this for political influence and commercial gain. This is why privacy is essential to protect personal autonomy, and this is also why privacy is a critical basis for maintaining an open web, the same aspiration that Web3 protocols are now building.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Decentralized social protocols such as Bluesky, Nostr, and Mastodon prioritize privacy as a core principle because they are designed to give users control over their personal data. Decentralized systems distribute control and ownership of data across a network of users, rather than centralizing it with a single entity. This approach allows users to maintain ownership and control over their personal data, and to share it only on a need-to-know basis.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">These platforms prioritize privacy and security by using advanced encryption standards to protect user data, and operate without collecting or storing personal user information, which are not essential for the platform to function in the first place. Through these platforms, users can communicate and share content without fear of being tracked or censored. By prioritizing privacy, these platforms empower users to take control of their personal data and protect their privacy in an age where data breaches and privacy violations have become all too common.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Crypto and sovereignty</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Open and decentralized infrastructure in the crypto space are linked to concepts of sovereignty. With the decentralized nature of blockchain technology, crypto represents broader implications for both technology and human culture. In general, sovereignty refers to the idea that a state has complete authority and control over its own territory and people. It is a fundamental principle of modern nation-states and is often seen as the cornerstone of political power. Crypto represents the opposite, or at least an opposition, of these principles. It has, in recent years, emerged as a response to concerns about the centralized control of financial systems, as well as the erosion of privacy and personal freedoms. As such, it represents a movement that values autonomy, transparency, and self-governance, one that that seeks to empower individuals and communities to take control of their financial and social lives.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Decentralization, hence, opens possibilities where, rather than being controlled by a central authority, such as a government or a financial institution, protocols and communities may operate and grow based on distributed, horizontal values. From code to theory, every aspect of these social units work collectively, whether it's in terms of verification or validation for transactions, or governance and improvement proposals. What does this mean? This forwards the idea that crypto is inherently resistant to centralized control and is more resilient to censorship and manipulation, by design.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This tendency towards autonomy against authority is partly driven by the political philosophy of many early crypto pioneers, who saw crypto as a way to challenge the power of traditional financial and political institutions. They believed that by creating a decentralized financial system, they could create a more democratic and equitable society that was less dependent on the state.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This tension, however, has created challenges and risks. Certain governments have responded to the rise of crypto with a stark skepticism, or even hostility, viewing crypto as a sort of threat to state power and authority, especially in the domain of finance and economy. Some others, still, have argued that crypto and blockchain technologies can be utilized for defense. Tighter regulation continues, and total bans are still happening.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Despite these, crypto both as an industry and as a global community continues to grow and evolve, driven by a desire for greater autonomy and self-determination.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Argentina had to accept an anti bitcoin clause for an IMF bailout. El Salvador was told to drop bitcoin, but refused. Which country did better?</p>
Argentina accepts anti-crypto clause for bailout
<p>Back in March 2022 Argentina was given a $45 billion bailout by the International Monetary Fund. The bailout was sorely needed given that Argentina was about to default on its debts.</p>
<p>However, a surprising clause was inserted into the deal. This meant that Argentina needed to take a tough anti-crypto stance henceforth. According to Fortune.com, the Economy Minister Mart&iacute;n Guzm&aacute;n and the central bank president Miguel Pesce were both obliged to sign a letter of intent in which it was laid out how cryptocurrencies would be discouraged in order to &ldquo;prevent money laundering&rdquo; and &ldquo;to further safeguard stability&rdquo;.</p>
<p>At the time the previous month&rsquo;s inflation figure was recorded at a distinctly unhealthy level of 52.3%, and therefore Guzm&aacute;n said that the bailout deal would help the country to avoid &ldquo;a profound monetary and inflationary stress that would derail Argentina&rsquo;s economic recovery and have consequences on poverty,&rdquo; as reported by Al Jazeera.</p>
<p>Roll forward a year later, and the March inflation figure for Argentina has been announced at 104.3%. Argentinian citizens have seen the value of their purchasing power reduce by 100% over the course of just one year.</p>
<p>Did the IMF know that this would likely be the case? And did the most influential world financial organisation do its best to stop Argentinians from fleeing their currency into Bitcoin in order to protect themselves?</p>
El Salvador says no to IMF
<p>Also in the American continent, but in Central America, is the small country of El Salvador. Now far more prominent in the world thanks to its adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender, El Salvador has made many enemies due to its pro-Bitcoin stance.</p>
<p>In a report from January 2022, at a roughly similar time as Argentina was preparing for its bailout, a BBC article stated that the adoption of Bitcoin had led to &ldquo;large scale protests&rdquo; and that there were &ldquo;fears it would bring instability and inflation&rdquo; to the country.</p>
<p>The IMF was scathing of the decision, warning President Bukele of the many risks that Bitcoin could bring to the country, and threatening that it would now be difficult for El Salvador to be granted any more loans. The IMF urged the El Salvadoran government to remove the legal status for Bitcoin.</p>
El Salvador is flourishing
<p>More than a year has passed since the furore over El Salvador&rsquo;s decision. The President and his government held firm and the results so far have been highly encouraging.</p>
<p>According to the World Bank, GDP growth for El Salvador has climbed abruptly since 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Source: World Bank</p>
<p>In addition, the homicide rate has declined to an estimated 2.5 for 2023, from a high of 103 back in 2015.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Source: https://elsalvadorinfo.net/homicide-rate-in-el-salvador/</p>
<p>El Salvador&rsquo;s holdings of Bitcoin are still under water by around 30%, but going by Bitcoin&rsquo;s halving cycles, the country might expect to be in a net profit in the next year or so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And finally, El Salvadoran citizens overseas have the option to send money home via the Bitcoin rails instead of utiising usurious agencies such as Western Union, to say nothing of being able to start actually saving their wealth, instead of having it eaten away by inflation etc.</p>
<p>Argentinian citizens, on the other hand, are seeing their wealth evaporate. Bitcoin is a decentralised store of value outside the reach of greedy financial agencies and over-controlling governments, so it would perhaps behove Argentinians to put at least a part of their wealth into this asset.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Binance, the world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, has announced a new and significant upgrade to its ETH 2.0 staking service, which will be rebranded to ETH staking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the 27th of April 2023, Binance will introduce the Wrapped Beacon ETH (WBETH) on the ETH staking platform.&nbsp;</p>
The WBETH Solution&nbsp;
<p>Binance unveiled its latest staking offering through a Twitter post on its official handle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Introducing Wrapped Beacon ETH (WBETH) on #Binance ETH Staking, available from the 27th of April at 8 am UTC. WBETH allows you to use DeFi while continuing to receive your $ETH staking rewards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The latest staking solution from Binance is built on the Ethereum Network and puts Binance in the company of other liquid staking products such as Coinbase, Lido, Frax, and Rocket Pool. The new WBETH tokens will allow users to participate in DeFi initiatives outside the Binance exchange. In an official announcement, Binance stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Binance is rebranding ETH 2.0 Staking to ETH Staking and introducing Wrapped Beacon ETH (WBETH) on the ETH Staking service, effective from 2023-04-27 08:00 (UTC). WBETH is a new liquid staking token, where 1 WBETH represents 1 BETH and the total staking rewards accrued by the BETH token on ETH Staking after 2023-04-27 08:00 (UTC).&rdquo;</p>

A Few Details&nbsp;
<p>Following the launch, 1 WBETH token will be the equivalent of 1 BETH. According to Binance, users will be able to create WBETH by depositing 1 ETH and vice versa. Binance stated,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Each WBETH token will accrue ETH Staking rewards daily, in accordance with the daily APR on ETH Staking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Furthermore, to support the daily updates when it comes to the BETH/WBETH conversion rates, the &ldquo;wrap&rdquo; and &ldquo;unwrap&rdquo; functions will be paused each day at a predefined time. Binance will also continue to support its BETH/BUSD, BETH/USDT, and BETH/ETH spot trading pairings. However, users can also keep their BETH tokens in their spot wallets and receive daily staking rewards, and utilize the WBETH tokens to participate in DeFi projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adding WBETH to Binance&rsquo;s ETH staking service also gives users greater control over how they receive their staking payouts. The new token will allow users to access DeFi projects on other networks besides Binance. As a result, users can expand and diversify their crypto portfolios. Binance has stated that it has also created two smart contracts for the WBETH token, one for Ethereum and the other for the Binance Smart Chain.&nbsp;</p>
The Growing Popularity Of Liquid Staking Products
<p>Liquid staking products have gained significant popularity on Ethereum over the past couple of years. According to data from DeFillama, over 8 million ETH worth over $15 billion is locked into liquid staking derivatives. A majority of these assets, nearly 75%, are held by Lido Finance. Next in line is Coinbase&rsquo;s wrapped ETG product, which has just over $2 billion locked. These are followed by Rocket Pool, which has just over $980 million locked; Frax, with nearly $300 million; and Stakewise, with over $160 million.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>As the crypto market has continued to reel in from massive bearish pressure over the past year or so, the metaverse too seems to have lost some of its former momentum. However, as the use cases of this novel technological paradigm continue to emerge, many experts believe it's only a matter of time before this interconnected digital world revolutionizes several domains, including the world of fashion.</p>
<p>From a numbers standpoint, a recent study reveals that the worldwide market for digital fashion is projected to expand by $6.61 billion between 2021 and 2026. During this forecast period, the market is anticipated to experience a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36.47%, with a sustained increase in growth momentum thanks to the entrance of numerous fashion brands into the metaverse over the last couple of years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Big Brands are Embracing Digital Fashion
<p>Despite some naysayers referring to the idea of metaverse-centric fashion as a fad, it should be noted that many mainstream entities have already started investing in digital fashion. For example, Adidas recently partnered with Genies &mdash; an American avatar technology company &mdash; to create a wide selection of virtual clothing, while Nike acquired the digital sneaker brand RTFKT. Similarly, Roblox, an online gaming platform, has forged partnerships with Levis and Gucci to not only devise digital wearables but also host several virtual events in the near term.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, the Metaverse Fashion Week, an annual event taking place on Decentraland, has really brought the concept of metaverse fashion to the forefront. The 2023 iteration of the event featured designs from many prominent fashion labels such as Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Tommy Hilfiger, Est&eacute;e Lauder, Elie Saab, and Etro. The idea behind such events is to create a hybrid offering, one that combines the best of the physical and digital worlds.</p>
&nbsp;
Sustainability and Creative Freedom &mdash; The Metaverse Has Them Both
<p>One of the most significant aspects of metaverse fashion is its potential for sustainability. The fashion industry is responsible for a considerable portion of the world&rsquo;s annual carbon emissions, and therefore a shift towards digital clothing could help reduce the environmental impact of the sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, a recent study discovered that digital-only clothing is significantly more eco-friendly than physical clothing, producing 97% less CO2 and using about 3,300 liters less water per item. Furthermore, evidence indicates that substituting physical samples with digital ones during a brand's design and development stages can decrease the company's carbon footprint by an impressive 30%.</p>
<p>Not only that, digital fashion also offers creative freedom that isn't possible with traditional fashion. With digital garments, customization and modification are limitless, allowing for truly unique wardrobes that express individuality and style. In this regard, platforms like Upland are redefining this space immensely, offering users with wearables that cater to their various tastes and personalities &mdash; while being extremely holistic in their design structure.</p>
<p>To elaborate, Upland is a blockchain-based virtual world mirroring the real world. It allows users to purchase, sell, and trade virtual assets, and most recently, the platform introduced its inaugural &lsquo;Wearable Legits&rsquo; sale, featuring Brazilian-inspired costumes from the renowned Mangueira samba school in Rio de Janeiro. This addition enables &lsquo;Uplanders&rsquo; to customize their avatars according to their personalities and interests, encouraging deeper engagement with the virtual world.</p>
<p>As Upland expands and introduces more customization options, users can expect additional wearable costumes and accessories to further personalize their virtual avatars. This unique blend of metaverse fashion and blockchain technology is not only innovative but also environmentally conscious.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Looking ahead
<p>As people all over the globe continue to adopt and gravitate toward decentralized technologies, it stands to reason metaverse-based fashion will continue to gain more mainstream traction. This is because it not only offers a sustainable alternative to its traditional counterpart but also provides creative freedom for users to express their individuality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, with major brands and labels continuing to venture into the metaverse and platforms like Upland introducing novel innovations to redefine this burgeoning space, it is not unreasonable to expect the idea of virtual clothing to grow and change the fashion landscape for good.</p>
