<p>Bitcoin bulls managed to shake off December’s dust, decisively pushing past $17,000 for the first time in over three weeks. The world’s most traded cryptocurrency was trading at $17,348, up over 2.41% in the past 24 hours.</p>



<p>Ethereum led in gains surging by over 4.55% in the same period to trade at $1,330 Monday noon. Other cryptocurrencies in the top 15 groups by market capitalization also gained steam, led by Solana and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ada-leads-weekend-gains-as-cardano-eyes-super-bullish-milestones-for-2023-bitcoin-ether-little-changed/">Cardano</a>, up over 22% and 13%. Dogecoin, BNB and MATIC followed quietly, adding over 8%, 7% and 3.20% overnight. Overall, the global crypto market cap increased by 3.49% to tap&nbsp;$855.83B, according to data from CoinMarketCap.</p>



<p>Bitcoin’s surprising rebound comes after Friday’s positive nonfarm payment rolls data. While this data suggests an imbalance between labour supply and demand still exists, investors viewed cooling wages as a sign the Fed may slow its rate-hiking ambitions. Moreover, with the US inflation expected to remain stable in the coming week, economists have been pencilling in a 25 basis-point increase in the Fed’s benchmark rate, with some FED officials suggesting that a half-point hike is possible.</p>



<p>Fed’s monetary tightening is a big factor in Bitcoin’s price movement, contributing significantly to the cryptocurrency’s 64% decline last year. Observers have thus argued that the top crypto benefits immensely from the FED easing its monetary policy.</p>



<p>On January 4, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) announced that hedge funds significantly reduced their Bitcoin short positions “across the board” towards the end of 2022. Bitcoin futures open interest decreased by 1,086 from 14,124 on December 27 to 13,038 on January 4. This rate of decline suggests that investors should keep an eye on the conversion movement with long bets.</p>



<p>Confidence in the crypto sector has also been rekindling as authorities continue <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-feds-launch-ftx-task-force-to-trace-and-recover-stolen-investor-funds/">to crack down</a> on FTX officials and other rogue actors worldwide-suggesting regulations may soon follow. According to John Reed Stark, Former Chief of SEC’s Office of Internet Enforcement, the trend is likely to continue, bringing back crypto’s shine and allure.</p>



<p>Onchain, Bitcoin’s sentiment indicator, has turned neutral, with exchange signals tilting to extremely bullishness, according to data from the crypto analytics platform IntoTheBlock. 53% of BTC holders are also depicted as making money at the moment, with only 37% being in the loss.</p>



<p>While there is still room for <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-price-could-get-as-low-as-9000-asserts-pundit-who-correctly-predicted-btcs-top/">Bitcoin to plummet</a>, traders expect the price to mount a mini rally towards the $18,200 resistance. According to Cryptoquant’s “Greatest_Trader”, “<em>the end of the current bear market won’t be expected unless the price surpasses the realized price, currently at $19.7K.”</em></p>

<p>For most crypto firms, 2023 continues right from 2022, following the collapse of former crypto king Sam Bankman-Fried’s empire in November. In the past three months, layoffs in the sector have hit an all-time high as crypto prices drop to record lows.</p>



<p>However, of most concern has been the rate at which major crypto lending firms have been declaring bankruptcy, with most of them tracing back connections to FTX or Alameda research. Gemini, a US-based crypto exchange, is now on the brink of facing a similar situation.</p>



<h2 id="h-gemini-s-uncertain-future"><strong>Gemini’s Uncertain Future</strong></h2>



<p>In the past week, the exchange has come under the spotlight for its huge crypto holdings trapped in Genesis, which has had liquidity issues since the FTX collapse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gemini users have been unable to withdraw about $900M from the exchanges Earn program after the platform suspended the program due to Genesis halting withdrawals on November 16. Launched in February 2021, Gemini Earn is a service that promises interest payments of up to 7.4% APY compounded daily on cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>Apart from facing a string of user lawsuits, the Winklevoss twins-helmed crypto exchange has been trying to get Genesis to release the $900M to no avail. On Jan 2, Cameroon Winklevoss penned an open letter to Barry Silbert (CEO of Digital Currency Group, the parent company of Genesis), <a href="https://zycrypto.com/gemini-accuses-dcg-of-being-behind-genesis-woes/">accusing him</a> of “engaging in bad faith stall tactic” aimed at delaying negotiations to resolve the Genesis-Gemini situation. However, Barry denied the allegations, shifting the blame to Gemini, who failed to respond to a proposal on December 29th.</p>



<h2><strong>All Quiet on The Western Front</strong></h2>



<p>Despite facing a huge setback regarding the Earn, Gemini seems to have continued procession exchange user withdrawals without trouble. However, crypto analytics platform Cryptoquant has pointed out some glaring disparities suggesting that all may not be well with the New York-based exchange.</p>



<p>In a Jan 6 report, Cryptoquant revealed that Gemini “is experiencing declining exchange activity” on virtually all fronts. According to the firm,  cryptocurrency reserves for BTC, ETH, and stablecoins have dropped significantly. BTC deposits from other exchanges and trading volume have slumped to record lows, a sign that users are trying to avoid the exchange. </p>



<p><em>“These trends were exacerbated around the time Genesis paused withdrawals,”</em> wrote Cryptoquant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Onchain data, however, depicts Gemini as an institution-oriented exchange which could be the main reason it has been able to hold up. Institutions are generally depicted as long-term investors and hence have the appetite for holding through market storms retail investors. Last June, the exchange cut about 10% of its workforce, citing unfavourable market conditions, which could also help it cut on spending in the current crypto winter.</p>



<p>While it is unclear how long turbulent market conditions are likely to persist, it will be interesting to see how Gemini will come out of its current situation even as other crypto firms continue to fold.</p>

<p>Bitcoin’s <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-traders-hold-their-breath-as-the-new-year-opens-heres-whats-going-on-in-bitcoins-ecosystem/">turbulent performance</a> in 2022 hasn’t deterred big players from predicting a promising run for the asset in 2023. Bloomberg is one such platform with a bullish outlook on Bitcoin and presents notable reasons why the asset is poised to see rapid growth in the new year.</p>



<h2 id="h-bloomberg-cites-the-global-recession-as-a-bullish-propeller-for-bitcoin"><strong>Bloomberg cites the global recession as a bullish propeller for Bitcoin</strong></h2>



<p>In its most recent cryptocurrency outlook, Bloomberg analysts go over the impact of the perceived global recession on Bitcoin and other digital currencies in the market.</p>



<p><em>“The rising potential for a severe global economic shutdown may be a top crypto performance factor in 2023. Our bias is that Bitcoin is most likely to come out ahead in most scenarios…” Bloomberg explains.</em></p>



<p>It is worth noting that many other notable voices share Bloomberg’s views in the cryptocurrency industry. As 2022 came to a close and predictions for the new year rolled in, many prominent traders and investors mirrored this bullish sentiment.</p>



<p>The founder of Altana Digital Currency Fund, Alistair Milne, is one such figure. Milne called $45,000 for Bitcoin, given that inflation favours the asset.</p>



<p>Pointing to the inverted yield curve, which shows long-term interest rates are less than short-term interest rates, being a possible indicator, the report says that economic growth will ebb and result in implications for all assets.</p>



<p>Bitcoin could return to $12,000 or go even lower to $10,000 as a result. This would mean that the asset, which trades at $17,353 at press time, could shed anywhere from $4,490 or $6,940 of its current price. Nonetheless, it is still bound to make an upward comeback, the report maintained.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="647" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1-1024x647.png" alt="" class="wp-image-77025" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1-1024x647.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1-300x190.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1-1536x971.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1-2048x1294.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTCUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>It was also noted that another case scenario that might play out differently from last year is the Federal Reserve and central banks being forced to start “easing back on deflationary forces from declining asset prices.”</p>



<p>If this becomes the case, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-price-could-get-as-low-as-9000-asserts-pundit-who-correctly-predicted-btcs-top/">Bitcoin</a> could also follow another positive pathway.</p>



<p><em>“In this Fed pivot scenario, Bitcoin is poised to transition to a digital version of gold and perform like the metal and US treasury long bonds. A swift recovery in declining GDP and asset prices appear less likely.” </em>Bloomberg conclusively asserts.</p>

<p>Bitcoin and Ether traded without much fanfare Friday as the top crypto’s volatility continued its rapid decline. At press time, Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market volume, was trading at $16,983 after a 0.23% uptick in the past 24 hours.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Ether was exchanging hands at $1,272 after a 0.71% increase in the same period, according to CoinMarketCap data. Notably, the two cryptos continued to hold within a narrow range they have occupied since mid-December.</p>



<p>Other cryptos on the top-ten list of non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies continued to lose ground, with XRP, Dogecoin and MATIC plunging 2.90%, 3.78% and 2.77%, respectively, in the past day. The global cryptocurrency market capitalization increased by 0.74% to $830B, while the total crypto market volume dropped by 14.05%&nbsp;to $27.35B.</p>



<h2 id="h-cardano-leads-in-gains"><strong>Cardano Leads in Gains</strong></h2>



<p>Cardano managed to shake off the weakness, surging by 5.66% in the past 24 hours to trade at $0.29 at press time. In the past seven days, ADA, the native token for the Cardano proof-of-stake blockchain, has grown by over 18%, making it the largest gainer among the top ten cryptos.</p>



<p>ADA’s growth has been attributed to a range of key factors, including the user trust that goes with the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/charles-hoskinson-to-test-cardanos-new-wallet-with-1000000-worth-of-ada-experiment/">consistent growth</a> of its ecosystem. Earlier this week, Cardano dApps completed 16 million transactions hitting a new milestone. On January 4, crypto payments giant processor CoinGate noted in a report that ADA entered the top ten most used cryptos list for the first time in 2022.</p>



<p>Large investors also seem to be helping buoy ADA prices as the token’s current prices offer attractive discounts. Crypto market intelligence platform Santiment Feed attributed ADA’s end-of-week mini-surge to aggressive buying by addresses holding between 1M to 100M ADA.</p>



<p>According to the firm, this group of investors have added back 217.2M ADA since Jan 1 2023, despite dumping 568.4M coins in the final two months of 2022. As per the firm, this cohort “may be a main validator to watch for a price breakout”, potentially sending the price back to $0.30.</p>

<h2><strong>FTX Contagion Continues To Shake Markets.</strong></h2>



<p>Although the crypto market seems to have priced in the events of the last two or so months, the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-feds-launch-ftx-task-force-to-trace-and-recover-stolen-investor-funds/">FTX contagion</a> continues to unravel, suppressing crypto prices further. Crypto bank&nbsp;Silvergate Capital became the latest casualty announcing on Thursday it was cutting 40%&nbsp;of its staff after facing US$8.1 billion in withdrawals sparked by the FTX failure in November.</p>



<p>Genesis Global Trading, one of the leading lenders in the industry, also reportedly cut its headcount by 305 and is considering filing for bankruptcy, according to a report by Wall Street Journal, which cited people familiar with the matter. On Friday, Digital Currency Group, the parent company of Genesis Global Trading, announced it is shutting down a wealth-management division called HQ due to, among other reasons, a “prolonged crypto winter.”</p>

<ul>
<li>Fidelity files three trademark applications, delving into the metaverse with huge plans. </li>



<li>The firm leverages key areas like virtual real estate investments, NFT trading, and marketplace services. </li>



<li>Fidelity’s belief in digital assets has not wavered even after the implosion of FTX, with the firm poised to create more impact in the sector. </li>
</ul>



<p>Investment giant Fidelity is set to make inroads in the metaverse as its latest efforts in the development of web3 to the delight of metaverse users.</p>



<p>The firm filed three trademark applications in the United States covering a host of web3 products and services including, virtual real estate investments, cryptocurrency trading, and NFT marketplaces, among others. The investment giant&#8217;s latest move has kept users gleeful as they await the offerings in the metaverse. </p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks">filings</a>, the company is also looking at investment services for mutual and retirement funds in the metaverse. Another area is the provision of educational services and multiple conferences in digital reality platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>conducting classes, workshops, seminars, and conferences in the field of investments and in the field of marketing financial services in the metaverse and other virtual worlds,” </em>read the filing.</p>



<p>A metaverse electronic payment will also be rolled out as the filing states, “<em>financial administration of credit card accounts in the metaverse and other virtual worlds.” </em></p>



<p>Digital asset trading services in the metaverse will incorporate NFTs, cryptocurrencies, and electronic wallet services alongside a financial management advisory service in virtual real estate and referral services.</p>



<p><em>“Electronic wallet services in the nature of electronic storage and processing of virtual currency for electronic payments and transactions via a global computer network; digital currency, virtual currency, cryptocurrency digital token.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<h2 id="h-fidelity-s-digital-asset-drive">Fidelity’s digital asset drive&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Fidelity Investment’s push in cryptocurrencies this year has been nothing short of excellent despite the heavy criticisms by some lawmakers on its recent crypto offerings and the market downturn. In April, the firm announced plans to offer companies and their employees access to Bitcoin (BTC) in their 401(k) retirement accounts. </p>



<p>The investment company also launched Fidelity Crypto, a service that allows retail investors to trade Ethereum (ETH)  and BTC at zero fees from their phones. In October, the company increased its digital asset division by hiring 100 employees instead of other top firms laying off staff.</p>

<p>Bitcoin continued to trend range bound on Saturday, riling investors who had to contend with lacklustre price volatility in the past 14 months. At press time, the top cryptocurrency was trading at $16,966 after a 1.11% increase in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. Its biggest rival, Ethereum, also traded sluggishly at $1263- a level it has been toying at for the past two days.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="647" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1024x647.png" alt="" class="wp-image-77010" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1024x647.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-300x190.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1536x971.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-2048x1294.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTCUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Unlike the past year, where a clique of high net-worth investors like <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-bull-tim-draper-sticks-to-250000-price-prediction-for-btc-in-2023/">Tim Draper</a> and Ark Invest CEO Cathie woods made extremely optimistic calls for Bitcoin, it has increasingly become harder for investors to predict where crypto prices may be going as 2023 unravels. However, some sceptics are convinced that Bitcoin will plunge lower before the curve can flatten out in the coming days.</p>



<p>For instance, Gareth Soloway, the chief market strategist of InTheMoneyStocks, believes there is more room for Bitcoin to the downside. Speaking to Kitco News earlier yesterday, the pundit who correctly predicted Bitcoin’s 2021 top, noted that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/pundit-who-predicted-bitcoins-plunge-to-20k-lowers-bet-to-12000/">Bitcoin could plunge</a> to $9,000. </p>



<p><em>“I’m still looking at eventually $12,000 to $13,000 in a short-term target. I do believe it will go lower than that and pierce $10,000 and could go as low as $9,000 before all this is over.”</em> Soloway told Kitco’s, David Lin.</p>



<p>According to him, the Bitcoin chart was in the process of forming a “bear flag pattern” which, if validated, could see its price drop to the said level. He, however, stated that BTC was likely to see a minor rally in the near term.</p>



<p><em>“All we have to do is take out $17,000, and I actually think we are going to get a short-term rally to about $18,400. So actually, I’m very short-term bullish, but you can’t ignore the bigger pattern here, which is still bearish.”</em></p>



<p>Soloway’s predictions come even as the FTX debacle hammers the markets. In the past two months, firms linked to Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire have been folding, crushing investors’ risk appetite. To Soloway, however, whereas “there is still some flushing to do”, there was no doubt that all this was getting closer to ending.</p>



<p><em>“We are also getting close to potential regulation, which I think will be a huge asset for bitcoin and crypto as that will be an avenue for big money to start dabbling in crypto again,”</em> he went on. </p>



<p>Previously, Soloway has called for <a href="https://zycrypto.com/analyst-gareth-soloway-reveals-probable-trigger-for-bitcoins-ascent-to-500000/">Bitcoin at $500,000</a> in the long term as clear regulations for the crypto sector are passed, and adoption picks up. Since tapping an all-time high of $68,789 in November 2021, Bitcoin’s price has fallen over 75%, making it the fourth largest wipe-out of all time in the asset’s history.</p>

<p>MicroStrategy, the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin reserves, has continued to splash cash towards BTC purchases ignoring cynics and the industry’s chaos created by the stunning collapse of FTX.</p>



<h2 id="h-microstrategy-buys-more-btc"><strong>MicroStrategy Buys More BTC</strong></h2>



<p>In a Dec 28 filing with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), the business intelligence company disclosed it had purchased 2,395 bitcoins for approximately $43 million between Nov 1, 2022, and Dec 21, 2022.</p>



<p>More interestingly, it revealed that it sold 704 BTC on Dec 22 to help it take advantage of the various US tax benefits given bitcoin’s vanished value since it first started acquiring the cryptocurrency in 2020. Notably, it later bought back 810 bitcoins at $16,845 per coin on Dec 24.</p>



<p>The latest purchase now brings MicroStrategy’s holdings to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/crypto-community-fears-centralization-as-microstrategys-bitcoin-holdings-hit-132500-btc/">approximately 132,500 BTC</a> acquired at a total cost of around $4.03 billion and an average purchase price of approximately $30,397 a coin.</p>



<h2><strong>Crypto Community Puzzled At BTC Purchases</strong></h2>



<p>Whereas calls to purchase BTC at current discounted prices have been rising among crypto users, not everyone is stoked by MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy.</p>



<p>In the wee hours on Saturday, Michael Saylor, the company’s founder and former CEO, shared a Bitcoin performance chart from 2020, tweeting;</p>



<p><em>“The Bitcoin Strategy is winning for MicroStrategy.”</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/tuOaasGcaPbzNpJ5f5j-QtThyQUNHB5b046QcKY2YFmfzFzNzTifDt6KiBMW6OMnwvZdcHcyIAYC-gjnm3-zZNW52sg-jCp5XMy5fF40ZQ_MPYlqIPLyTLQxytH2NmaQodAzl83dQxqh0fQnEE1XvWLak_j23CJfd1vOqNkavQUB70bCxEN0mP3tH3DHw5yG4HEA4ygMJg" alt="C:\Users\Newton\Downloads\Fl0vsS3WYAM85fc.png"/></figure>



<p>The tweet, which has since garnered close to a million views, has received mixed reactions, with most comments suggesting most crypto adherents have lost hope in his bitcoin acquisition strategy.</p>



<p><em>“Microstrategy Bitcoin holdings are down 45%, which is almost the worst performer here. This chart assumes he went all in on Bitcoin at the date provided. In reality, he&#8217;s just been averaging in as everything crashes which defeats the point of this graphic,”</em> Fellow trader Nebraskan Gooner commented on the chart. </p>



<p><em>“$MSTR is down 90% from the high, has over 1 billion unrealized loss on the bitcoin, and has over $700 million debt to get those BTC. If that&#8217;s winning to you then I don&#8217;t want to know what losing means to you,”</em> another wrote.</p>



<p>With Bitcoin trading at around $16,966 at press time, MicroStrategy’s stash would now be worth just over $2.24 Billion, translating to an unrealized loss of about $1.79 billion.</p>



<p>Moreover, apart from debts owed to creditors for the purchase of Bitcoin, shares of MicroStrategy have continued to tumble, dropping nearly 50% following the FTX debacle.</p>



<p>Despite the downturn, MicroStrategy, which turned to bitcoin in 2020 as a hedge against inflation, remains unwavering, with Michael Saylor stressing that they <a href="https://zycrypto.com/microstrategy-reiterates-it-has-a-long-term-focus-on-bitcoin-despite-a-harrowing-year/">will never sell</a> their Bitcoin. Saylor, who has previously revealed he owns 17,732 bitcoins, believes that the world most traded cryptocurrency is “unstoppable” and that, ultimately “, Bitcoin is the separation of money and state”.</p>

<ul>
<li>The partnership is a win for the Ethereum-scaling network, having welcomed a major NFT project from Solana, y00ts.</li>



<li>Polygon’s native MATIC token added 3% in the last 24 hours.</li>
</ul>



<p>Financial services giant Mastercard is collaborating with Polygon to bring together music artists, their fans, and industry mentors through a Web 3 accelerator program. Mastercard Artist Accelerator will launch in spring 2023 with a live-streamed artists showcase &#8211; per the announcement.</p>



<p>The program targets musicians, DJs, and producers with the tools to share their content on Web 3, including minting non-fungible tokens (NFTs). It includes exclusive access to special events and music releases. For the fans, the MasterCard Artist Accelerator features a limited NFT edition dubbed The MasterCard Music Pass, providing users with exclusive Web3 learning resources.</p>



<p>Commenting about the launch during the Consumer Electronics Show, MasterCard Chief Marketing and Communication Officer Raja Rajammanar termed the partnership as an opportunity to nurture budding artists. &#8220;<em>Music is a universal passion, inspiring, moving, and bringing us together; however, it can feel impossible for budding artists to break in. With the MasterCard Accelerator, we are expanding access and driving connections further with cutting-edge Web3 technology,</em>&#8221; he said.</p>



<h2 id="h-mastercard-artist-accelerator-program-targets-new-crop-of-artists"><strong>Mastercard Artist Accelerator Program Targets New Crop of Artists</strong></h2>



<p>Polygon Studios, the firm behind Polygon blockchain, is optimistic that the program will empower a new generation of artists using blockchain technology &#8211; also educate the public about the technology. &#8221;<em>Web3 has the potential to empower a new type of artists that can grow a fan base, make a living and introduce novel mediums for self-expression and connection on their terms,</em>&#8221; CEO Ryan Wyatt said.</p>



<p>The announcement has boosted the price of Polygon’s native MATIC token, up to an intraday high of $0.8104, according to data shared by CoinMarketCap. The price changed by +3% in the past day and +5.79% in the last week. MATIC ranks tenth among other cryptos, with a market capitalization of more than $7 billion.</p>



<p>Mastercard Artist Accelerator is a win for Polygon, one of the fastest blockchains, onboarding major brands like Starbucks, Nike, and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/polygon-nfts-finally-coming-to-over-1-4-billion-instagram-users-matic-primed-for-huge-boost/">Instagram</a>. The blockchain is said to have paid $3m in grants to have Solana NFT projects, y00ts, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/solana-is-losing-its-touch-with-nfts-as-major-projects-announce-departure/">moved</a> to its platform. Together with DeGods, another NFT platform on Solana, y00Ts generated some of the highest NFT sales on Solana, up to 70%.</p>

<ul>
<li>Analysts mirror the development of the market in 2023 in line with the current status and future landmark activities.</li>



<li>The SEC v Ripple case, stablecoin, DeFi regulations, and demystification of the FTX saga, among others, are pivotal in swinging the pendulum.</li>



<li>Network upgrades on Ethereum, Solana and other blockchains rolled out this year will also set the tone for web3 development.</li>
</ul>



<p>The new year has come with new speculations and insights over the market as experts mirror key factors that can shape the growth of web3 over the next 12 months.</p>



<p>The major area analysts have dwelt on is the market&#8217;s bearish trend. Is an end in sight? Last year was chaotic, with several top assets losing as much as 60% in value with no positive roads in sight. Market leader, Bitcoin, slumped over 55% last year and still hangs below $17,000.</p>



<p>On the bright side, inflation is on the decline, and many experts have predicted stocks and other assets to bounce back, so the bear season may soon be over.</p>



<p>The SEC v Ripple (XRP) case is now two years old, and the final decision would be a landmark case for both the SEC and Ripple. On the side of the SEC, a judgment declaring XRP as a security could reshape digital asset regulation in the country.</p>



<p>Some commentators believe that the case would have a wider reach with authorities going after centralized exchanges like Binance US, Coinbase, and Kraken. Lewis Cohen, an attorney specializing in web3 and digital assets, stated that the SEC wants to go all out of its wins against XRP.</p>



<p>“<em>If they got their way, most US token marketplaces could not allow users to buy and sell ‘crypto securities’ without registering as an exchange or getting an exemption,” </em>he added.</p>



<p>A win for Ripple will prevent a draconian push by regulators to describe digital assets as securities. Specifically, it will be a landmark <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-ripple-will-triumph-in-sec-battle-and-gary-gensler-will-resign-this-year-pundit-predicts/">moment</a> for the XRP Army, which believes its beloved asset is being held back by the SEC.</p>



<h2 id="h-more-upgrades-for-ethereum"><strong>More upgrades for Ethereum</strong></h2>



<p>After Ethereum’s Merge last year, which <a href="https://zycrypto.com/the-merge-goes-live-and-a-new-era-for-ethereum-begins-heres-the-whole-bushel/">transitioned</a> the network to a proof-of-stake model reducing its energy usage by 99%, Vitalik Buterin restated his commitment to continue leading the advancement of web3. The blockchain will implement a Shanghai upgrade in Q1 2023 to enable stakers to withdraw their Ethereum (ETH).</p>



<p>Since staking kicked off on the blockchain, users have staked about $20 billion worth of ETH, including newly generated ETH, and will be available for withdrawal in March. Ethereum is also poised to extend its leadership as the leader in NFTs and other projects as its closest rival, Solana, battles migrating projects and technical issues.</p>

<p>Indonesia is considering setting up a national crypto exchange to keep pace with the fast-changing financial landscape.</p>



<p>Citing a Wednesday report by Bloomberg, the exchange is expected to launch later this year before the country assigns the Financial Services Authority (FSA) control over such assets. Presently, crypto assets in Indonesia are policed by “Bappebti” -the country’s commodities futures trading regulatory agency responsible for regulating commodity contracts.</p>



<p>Confirming the plan on Wednesday, January 4, Bappebti acting head Didid Noordiatmoko noted that the move was part of the country’s broader <a href="https://zycrypto.com/indonesia-set-to-tax-crypto-transactions-and-investments-from-may/">financial sector plan</a>.</p>



<p><em>“The FSA will assume regulatory power over the assets over the next two years, by which time the exchange should be set up,”</em> said Noordiatmoko.</p>



<p>The statement comes even as lawmakers push for a regulation seeking to task the FSA with regulation strengthening supervision and oversight of crypto-assets which have been booming in the South East Asia nation. Lawmakers presented the draft law in September 2022 following the Terra-induced turbulence by cryptocurrencies and the need to tighten the regulation of crypto exchanges.</p>



<p>Despite adopting a strict anti-crypto stance in the past, partially due to local regulations and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/indonesias-islam-council-bans-muslims-from-trading-bitcoin-deems-crypto-as-haram/">Islamic laws,</a> Indonesia has been loosening its noose, opting for progressive regulations as demand for crypto assets continues to soar. According to the country’s trade ministry, as of November 30th 2022, there were 16 million crypto investors compared to 11.2 million at the end of 2021. </p>



<p>Despite the ongoing crypto winter slashing trading volumes globally, statistics provided by the trade ministry showed that Indonesians traded 212 trillion rupiahs ($14.3 billion) worth of crypto in the first half of 2022. Presently 383 crypto assets and 10 local coins can be traded by Indonesians, with another 151 assets and 10 coins under evaluation by the Bappebti.</p>



<p>It is important to note that while trading in digital assets is legal in the country, the use of crypto payments as a form of payment is prohibited in Indonesia after the country imposed a blanket ban on the practice in 2017. That could change if the proposed law on moving crypto assets from the  Bappebti to the FSA is passed. </p>

<ul>
<li>The Manhattan US Attorney’s Office has created a task force to recover losses linked to the collapse of FTX.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The move comes as embattled FTX co-founder and CEO pleaded not guilty to several counts of fraud.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Analysts laud the creation of the task force and call for a renewed push against activities of bad actors in the cryptosphere.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>The US Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) has formed an ‘FTX task force’ to investigate and recover investor funds as well as to handle others related to the implosion of FTX last year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Damian Williams, a federal prosecutor on the FTX case, disclosed the task force&#8217;s establishment in a statement adding that all resources and expertise will be put in to ensure that justice is served. </p>



<p><em>“The Southern District of New York is working around the clock to respond to the implosion of FTX, all hands are on deck. We are launching the SDNY FTX task force to ensure that this urgent work continues, powered by all the SDNY’s resources and expertise until justice is done.”</em></p>



<p>Led by Andrea Griswold, the task force will use asset forfeiture to recover billions owed to FTX users. The task force is made up of experienced and seasoned prosecutors from various SDNY divisions, including the Public Corruption Unit, Commodities Fraud and Transactional Crime Enterprise Unit. </p>



<p>Griswold is also popular among digital asset circles for investigating the collapse of Terra&#8217;s stablecoin UST and LUNA token last year which wiped billions from the market. The FTX implosion has also resulted in huge losses, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) estimating over $8 billion loss for users. </p>



<p>FTX filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection in November, claiming to have 100,000 creditors and liabilities going over $10 billion. </p>



<h2 id="h-sbf-pleads-not-guilty">SBF pleads not guilty&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The creation of the task force comes after Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) pleaded not guilty to all charges of fraud linked to the collapse of FTX. SBF is now scheduled to face trial on Oct 2, with the court granting further bail conditions which prohibit SBF from accessing or transferring FTX assets. </p>



<p>SBF could potentially face <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ftxs-sbf-bags-250-million-bail-could-face-up-to-100-years-in-jail-as-close-associates-plead-guilty/">jail time</a> of up to 115 years if he is found guilty of all eight counts of fraud. Last month, former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison and FTX co-founder Gary Wang pleaded guilty to fraud charges concerning their roles in the collapse of the digital asset exchange.</p>

<p>Ethereum whales are busy amassing Shiba Inu ahead of the anticipated <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-finally-wants-to-drop-the-memecoin-tag-with-the-debut-of-its-own-blockchain-as-adoption-rate-wobbles/">Shibarium launch</a>. Whalestats shows that the meme crypto was among the top ten most purchased tokens among the top 2,000 largest Ethereum investors as of this week.</p>



<p>What is fueling the high whales’ appetite is the much-awaited Shibarium. It is a layer-2 platform expected to improve the performance of Shiba Inu. Speculations were heightened that Shibarium could be launched soon after the ecosystem’s lead developer Shytoshi Kusama remarked on the same. &#8220;<em>Love meeting with the team from UnificationUND about Shibarium. Aligning. Onboarding. Finalizing. Soon. Very Soon,</em>&#8221; Kusama said.</p>



<p>Described as the foundation for the Shiba Inu ecosystem, Shibarium features a decentralized exchange (DEX), blockchain games, and the metaverse &#8211; all of which have been under development. Shiba Inu currently relies on Ethereum, with shortcomings being slow transactions and high gas fees. However, that is bound to change within the layer-2 solution. Shibarium will take most of the transactions off Ethereum while still using the blockchain as a security layer.</p>



<h2 id="h-shibaswap-governance-token-bone-jumps-double-digit"><strong>ShibaSwap Governance Token BONE Jumps Double-Digit</strong></h2>



<p>BONE, a governance and utility token, has gained the most from the sentiment among the five major tokens in the Shiba Inu ecosystem. The digital asset, capped at 230,000,000 tokens, has gained 10% in the past week, according to data from CoinGecko. On the other hand, SHIB declined by 0.36% in the same period.</p>



<p>LEASH and TREAT are the other tokens expected to play a key role in the upcoming Shibarium. Both tokens can be staked for rewards in Shiba Inu liquidity pools. Also in the plan is SHI, a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-primed-for-strong-recovery-as-ecosystem-mulls-introducing-stablecoin-before-year-end/">utility stablecoin</a>. The Shibarium developers have also added a token burn mechanism to cut the supply of SHIB.</p>



<p>The latest data from the Shiba Inu burn tracker, Shibburn shows that the number of burned SHIB to date was 410,384,382,996,444 as of the time of writing these lines. The canine-themed token launched with an initial supply of a quadrillion tokens, out of which that in circulation stands at 562,850,341,247,185.</p>

<p>Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau has called for <a href="https://zycrypto.com/france-calls-for-eu-wide-cryptocurrency-regulation/">tougher regulatory requirements</a> for crypto firms even as European Union Nations chart a path forward for an all-around regulation.</p>



<p>According to a Jan 5 Bloomberg report, the governor stressed the need for France to move with urgency in enacting sound rules for the crypto sector when delivering a speech to the financial sector in Paris. Villeroy noted the recent volatility in the sector means France should not wait for European rules to come into effect before it can make licensing for Digital Asset Service Providers (DASPs) compulsory.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“All the disorder in 2022 feeds a simple belief: it is desirable for France to move to an obligatory licensing of DASP as soon as possible, rather than just registration,”</em> said Villeroy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently, licensing laws for DASPs are optional. However, persons who provide “crypto trading” and “custody services” on behalf of third parties must register with the AMF. About 60 crypto firms, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-eyes-france-as-spot-for-a-global-headquarters-amid-regulatory-thunderstorms/">including Binance</a>, operate in the country, having received lighter registration from the country’s Financial Markets Authority (FCA). At least 50 others operate in the country without licenses.</p>



<p>France has an eased regime for regulating digital asset providers, a factor that has often challenged its efforts to present itself as the most pro-crypto nation among EU nations.</p>



<p>Mid last month, Herve Maurey, a Senate finance committee member, proposed an amendment, which, if passed, will see the clause allowing crypto firms to operate without a license until 2026 removed. Proposing the amendment, Maurey noted that the FTX collapse had been a game changer, warranting tightening of rules urgently regardless of when the MiCA rules would be passed.</p>



<p><em>“This (FTX) led a number of players within the French system to consider that things needed to be supervised more tightly,”</em> he said.</p>



<p>That said, the amendment could end the option to operate without stringent checks as early as October 2023, with deliberations in the French parliament kicking off this month.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the soon-to-be ratified <a href="https://zycrypto.com/finalized-eu-mica-crypto-regulation-seeks-to-police-nfts-and-algorithmic-stablecoins/">Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCA)</a> regulation, which has been pending in the EU parliament, is expected to enter into force in early 2023. First tabled in 2020, the regulation seeks to establish harmonized rules for crypto assets and related services and activities for the EU level and put into place a framework that is intended to avoid Terra or FTX-style collapses.</p>

<p>Solana, one of the largest proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies, has been going bonkers, jumping over 40% in the past seven days on the back of BONK, a dog-themed token that recently debuted on the Solana ecosystem.</p>



<p>Launched on Dec. 25, BONK is a meme coin modelled after Shiba Inu and features a dog avatar. BONK is described as “the first Solana dog coin for the people, by the people.” Accordingly, 50% of the token’s supply is said to have been airdropped to the Solana community as a way of compensating them following FTX and Alameda’s collapse, according to a statement on the token’s website.</p>



<p>“<em>The Bonk community were tired of toxic “Alameda” tokenomics and wanted to make a fun meme coin where everyone gets a fair shot,”</em> read the statement.</p>



<p>In the past 24 hours, BONK has surged 42.90%, according to data from CoinMarketCap. This growth has also convinced some Solana traders that the token’s trading volume is potentially driving Solana’s price up, therefore piling into BONK.</p>



<p>Solana’s rebound comes after the cryptocurrency dropped as low as $8.30 on Dec. 29 after being caught up in the loss wave following the implosion of FTX and Alameda Research.</p>



<p>As ZyCrypto reported, Sam Bankman-Fried’s public support for Solana and revelations of Alameda holding a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/despite-solanas-tumble-amid-the-ftx-collapse-the-community-is-keeping-its-hopes-high/">significant chunk</a> of SOL on its balance sheet painted the cryptocurrency in bad light leading to a massive retail dump. Between Nov 7 and Dec 29 2022, SOL lost over 77% of its value, bringing the asset&#8217;s total losses to just over 96%.</p>



<p>Solana also witnessed a massive exodus of projects building on the ecosystem, with Non-fungible token (NFT) firm Dust Labs announcing plans to bridge off two of its top-performing Solana NFT projects, DeGods and y00ts, onto Ethereum and Polygon.</p>



<p>With the dust settling on the FTX saga following the arrest of Sam Bankman-Fried, the Solana community seems to be pulling themselves together with the hope of reviving Solana’s lost glory. In the past three weeks, calls on the community to focus on the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/heres-why-solanas-future-is-still-bright-despite-sol-price-nuking-97-below-ath-vitalik-buterin/">ecosystem’s developments</a> and growth as opposed to sideshows have been rising.</p>



<p>Last week, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin expressed support for Solana, noting that “the chain has a bright future” after the recent sell-off washed out “the awful opportunistic money people.” He went on to note that he hoped that Solana’s community would get its fair chance to thrive.</p>



<p>SOL was trading at $13.19 after a 1.22% drop in the past 24 hours.</p>
