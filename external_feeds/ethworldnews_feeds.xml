<ul><li>Tesla and Elon Musk have gone on the offensive against the lawyer representing the Dogecoin plaintiffs.&nbsp;</li><li>A new filing by Musk claimed that the plaintiff’s lawyer knew that his premise of the case was false.&nbsp;</li><li>Musk and Tesla stated in the filing that the wallets associated with the DOGE sales did not belong to them.&nbsp;</li><li>Dogecoin tanked more than 7% on the day that Musk and Tesla submitted their filing.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Elon Musk and Tesla Inc. have gone on the offensive against the lawyer representing the plaintiffs in the lawsuit filed by Dogecoin investors. In a recent filing with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, the tech billionaire, and his electronic vehicle giant sought Rule 11 sanctions against Evan Spencer of Even Spencer Law. Spencer represents a prospective class of Dogecoin who sued Musk and his EV firm for manipulating the price of the memecoin for personal giants.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Dogecoin Tanked 7% Following Elon Musk’s Latest Court Filing</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/column-musk-tesla-go-attack-against-dogecoin-plaintiffs-lawyer-2023-07-17/" rel="nofollow noopener">Reuters</a>, Elon Musk and Tesla filed a motion for Rule 11 sanctions against Evan Spencer, the lawyer representing the plaintiffs in the Dogecoin lawsuit. They claimed in the latest filing that Spencer was aware of his case being based on a false premise before he lodged his claims. The latest claims marked a new offensive from Musk and his legal team. </p>



<p>The latest court filing by Elon Musk and Tesla came more than a month after Spencer <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/dogecoin-accuse-elon-musk-insider-trading/">filed</a> an amended complaint on behalf of the plaintiffs. The complaint accused the tech billionaire of netting billions of dollars by dumping DOGE after hyping up the memecoin on Twitter, which Musk recently acquired. However, the new filing by Musk’s attorneys argued that the wallets cited in the amended complaint were not owned by Tesla or its owner. </p>



<p>The filing further stated that Spencer was aware of the same before he submitted the amended complaint, which included accusations of insider trading. Elon Musk and Tesla urged the overseeing judge to dismiss the amended complaint and sanction Evan Spencer. <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogecoin/" rel="nofollow noopener">DOGE</a> lost more than 7% of its value following the filing of the motion for sanctions. At the time of writing, the meme token was trading at $0.0699. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.ethena.fi/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.ethena.fi/" rel="nofollow noopener">Ethena </a>strives to become a pioneer in the crypto industry by developing a stablecoin and digital savings bond. These innovative financial products will be supported by derivatives and will maintain value, in relation to the US dollar without depending on the conventional financial system. Ethena is focusing on creating these offerings for investors outside of the United States.</p>



<p>One of their products is a stablecoin that has a mechanism to preserve its peg to the US dollar. Additionally they are working on introducing the worlds native savings bond.</p>



<p>Former <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bitmexs-arthur-hayes-samuel-reed-step-down-from-ceo-and-cto-roles/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bitmexs-arthur-hayes-samuel-reed-step-down-from-ceo-and-cto-roles/">BitMex </a>CEO, Arthur Hayes will provide guidance and advice to Ethena. The project secured a $6 million seed funding from DragonFly, a venture capital firm specializing in investments, which was founded by Arthur Hayes himself. Notable participants in this round include crypto derivative exchanges like Deribit, ByBit, OKX, Gemini and Huobi.</p>



<p>The ultimate objective of Ethena is to establish an alternative to banking systems worldwide. They firmly believe that their stablecoin and savings bond will offer individuals a decentralized and accessible means of preserving and growing wealth.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img src="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ethena.png" alt="Arthur Hayes&#039;s &quot;Holy Grail&quot; Stablecoin DeFi Project Ethena Raises $6M 4" class="wp-image-583131" width="845" height="473" srcset="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ethena.png 593w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ethena-300x168.png 300w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ethena-269x151.png 269w" sizes="(max-width: 845px) 100vw, 845px" title="Arthur Hayes&#039;s &quot;Holy Grail&quot; Stablecoin DeFi Project Ethena Raises $6M 4"></figure>



<p>According to Guy Young, the Founder and CEO of Ethena their platform aims to address the immediate need within the crypto space: DeFi endeavors to create a parallel financial system; however stablecoins, which are vital financial instruments in this sector remain completely reliant, on traditional banking infrastructure.<br></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We strongly believe that individuals worldwide should have access, to a financial tool, a dollar based savings instrument to securely store their wealth. With our stablecoin we are bringing to life our vision of a native stablecoin that does not rely on traditional banking systems. This enables the creation of an permissionless internet bond.</p></blockquote>



<h2><strong>A breakdown of what Ethena does:</strong></h2>



<p><br><strong>Stablecoin:</strong> The Ethena stablecoin will be backed by derivatives holding equal amounts of staked ETH and perpetual swaps shorting Ethereum. This unique approach allows it to maintain its peg to the US dollar without depending on the infrastructure. This improvement addresses some of the limitations found in existing stablecoins which are often susceptible to manipulation and volatility.</p>



<p><strong><br>Savings bond</strong>: The Ethena savings bond will be a token that function similarly to a US treasury bond. However it distinguishes itself by being permissionless and accessible to individuals around the world. This means that anyone, regardless of their location or financial standing will have the opportunity to invest in the Ethena savings bond.</p>



<p><strong><br>Decentralized:</strong> Ethenas stablecoin and savings bond will be built on the Ethereum blockchain ensuring decentralization and transparency. This means that there won&#8217;t be a single point of failure and people will have control over their funds.</p>



<p><strong>Accessible:</strong> Everyone around the world, regardless of their location or financial status, will have access to Ethenas stablecoin and savings bonds. This accessibility is made possible because they will be built on the Ethereum blockchain, a platform that&#8217;s source and permissionless.</p>



<h2><strong>This Isn&#8217;t The First Time Stablecoins Backed By Derivatives Have Been Created</strong></h2>



<p>You heard it right! In the past there has been attempts to create stablecoins backed by derivatives. One example is Basis Cash, which launched in 2020. Basis Cash tried to maintain its value by relying on a mix of derivatives linked to the US dollar, gold and oil. Unfortunately it failed to maintain its peg and therefore had to shut down in 2021.</p>



<p>Another failed attempt was IRON Finance, which was launched in 2021. IRON Finance used derivatives tied to the US dollar and Ethereum as its backing. IRON Finance was also shut down in 2021 after it  even tually lost $150 million due to a hack.</p>



<p>The failures of Basis Cash and IRON Finance highlight the challenges in creating a stablecoin backed by derivatives that are both secure and dependable. Ethena presents an approach to leveraging derivatives for stabilizing a coin, which holds the potential, for success.</p>



<p>In the past there have been challenges, in understanding the complexities of derivatives. This has made it difficult for issuers to effectively manage the risks involved in using derivatives to support a stablecoin.</p>



<p>The trading costs associated with derivatives can be quite high. This poses a challenge for issuers who need to generate revenue to cover the expenses of maintaining the stablecoins value.</p>



<p>Derivatives are subject to regulations in jurisdictions. This adds another layer of difficulty for issuers as they strive to comply with the rules and regulations.</p>



<p>Despite these obstacles there are advantages in using derivatives as collateral for a stablecoin such as enhanced security, increased reliability and improved efficiency.</p>



<p><strong>“Ethena is building the holy grail of stablecoins: a coin that is truly stable, decentralized, and capital-efficient,” </strong>said Tom Schmidt, General Partner at Dragonfly. “Stablecoins have grown massively in popularity over the past few years by providing access to USD-denominated savings and remittances for people around the world, but they&#8217;ve always been handicapped by one of these three issues. Ethena has a breakthrough design that remedies these issues while also benefiting a broad user-base. We&#8217;re thrilled to be partnering with them to bring their vision to life.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ethena plans to utilize the initial investment to get ready for the release of their stablecoin and bond asset in the third quarter of 2023. This includes successfully finishing the testnet phase in Q3 of this year, establishing partnerships with prominent players in the industry and conducting thorough smart contract audits to guarantee the security and efficiency of the protocol.</p>

<ul><li>SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has expressed disappointment with the recent summary judgment in SEC v Ripple.&nbsp;</li><li>A judge recently handed a partial victory to Ripple after ruling that XRP’s retail sales didn’t constitute an investment contract.</li><li>Gensler has stated that his agency is assessing the judge’s opinion on XRP’s retail sales.&nbsp;</li><li>Meanwhile, the federal judge has referred the lawsuit to a magistrate judge who sided with Ripple on the controversial Hinman docs.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Gary Gensler, Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has expressed his disappointment with the recent summary judgment in the securities regulator’s lawsuit against Ripple. Gensler was referring to the ruling by New York Federal Judge Analisa Torres, who handed a partial victory to Ripple after ruling that retail sales of XRP did not constitute an investment contract.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Federal Judge Refers SEC v Ripple Case To Magistrate Judge</strong></h2>



<p>Gary Gensler’s latest comments came during an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xR4l5F8fLRU" rel="nofollow noopener">event</a> hosted by the National Press Club in Washington D.C. During his speech, the SEC Chair stated that despite being disappointed about the ruling regarding retail sales, he was pleased with the Judge’s decision regarding the institutional sales of XRP. The summary judgment came more than two years after the securities regulator sued <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/crypto-leaders-ripple-xrp-sec-judgement/">Ripple</a> and its executives for illegally raising $1.3 billion by selling XRP, which it described as an unregistered securities offering. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We’re pleased from that decision recognizing the importance of protecting investors on the institutional investors. While disappointed on what they said about retail investors, we’re still looking at it and assessing that opinion.&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p>In related news, Federal Judge Analisa Torres referred the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple to Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn. Judge Netburn made headlines earlier this year after ordering the SEC to hand over the controversial Hinman documents to Ripple. The documents are internal communications and speeches related to William Hinman, the SEC’s former Director of Corporation Finance, who stated in 2018 that Ethereum is not a security. </p>

<ul><li>A report by the Wall Street Journal stated that Binance slashed employee benefits last month.&nbsp;</li><li>The crypto exchange cited declining profits for cutting back benefits including work-from-home expenses.&nbsp;</li><li>CEO Changpeng Zhao revealed in a meeting last week that the company was still profitable.&nbsp;</li><li>The crypto exchange reportedly laid off more than 1,000 employees in recent weeks.</li></ul>



<p>Binance reportedly slashed employee benefits last month due to dwindling profits amid legal and regulatory trouble. The reduced benefits took effect on June 19, 2023, when the world’s largest crypto exchange cut back on several benefits, including fitness reimbursement. The crypto giant also indicated that more cost-cutting measures could be adopted in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao Says Company Is Still Profitable</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/binance-cuts-back-employee-benefits-citing-decline-in-profit-51d51cf7" rel="noopener">report</a> by The Wall Street Journal, Binance used its internal messenger to inform its employees about the slashing of benefits, which affected mobile-phone reimbursements and work-from-home expenses, among other benefits. The crypto exchange cited declining profits for cutting back employee benefits. A <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-lab-invest-15-million-xterio-game/">Binance</a> spokesperson stated that the company was reevaluating certain products, business units, and staff benefits to ensure that the company’s resources were being deployed properly. </p>



<p>During a company meeting on July 14, 2023, co-founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao told his employees that the company was still profitable. He added that the lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had no impact on the company’s operations. As for the employee benefits, Zhao stated that he wasn’t sure when they would be reinstated.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Considering the current market environment and regulatory climate that has unfortunately led to a decline in profit, we have to be more prudent with our spending.”</p><cite>Binance&#8217;s internal message to employees</cite></blockquote>



<p>News of the slashing of employee benefits comes just days after <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/binance-lays-off-over-1-000-employees-d59ff6ad" rel="noopener">WSJ</a> reported that Binance had fired more than 1,000 employees in recent weeks. Former employees told the Journal that several hundred additional customer-service personnel were laid off by the crypto exchange last week. Changpeng Zhao revealed in the company meeting that there could be additional layoffs every three to six months.  </p>

<p>Uniswap Labs, the decentralized finance startup behind the world’s largest decentralized crypto exchange, has launched a permissionless, open-source, and auction-based protocol called UniswapX. The new blockchain protocol will allow trading across automated market makers and other liquidity sources.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Uniswap CEO Hayden Adams Unveils UniswapX at EthCC Paris</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://blog.uniswap.org/uniswapx-protocol" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a> by Uniswap, Chief Executive Hayden Adams unveiled the new blockchain protocol earlier today at the Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) in Paris. The DeFi exchange rolled out an opt-in beta for the protocol on the Uniswap Labs interface. Given that the protocol is still in beta, the majority of the orders will go through classic routing. UniswapX is currently available for Ethereum Mainnet and will be expanded to other chains as well as the Uniswap Wallet later. </p>



<p><a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/uniswap-v3-deployment-on-fantom/">Uniswap</a> Labs stated that UniswapX will offer “next-level aggregation” by outsourcing the complexity of routing to an open network of fillers who compete to fill swaps in a cost-effective manner. The competitive filler forms will benefit the protocol’s users by offering maximum extractable value (MEV) protection, better prices, gas-free swapping, and zero cost for failed transactions. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>With UniswapX, swappers will be able to use the Uniswap interface without worrying whether they&#8217;re getting the best price, and transactions will always be transparently recorded and settled on-chain.”</p></blockquote>



<p>The DeFi protocol stated that it would launch a cross-chain UniswapX that would combine swapping and bridging under one roof. This would include native asset swaps that would reduce the need for bridged tokens. Uniswap’s governance token <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/uniswap/" rel="nofollow noopener">UNI</a> surged by more than 3% following the announcement of the new blockchain protocol. At the time of writing, the token was trading at $5.97. </p>

<ul><li>Projects in the web3 and decentralized finance spaces lost nearly half a billion dollars to hacks and exploits in the first half of 2023.</li><li>DeFi accounted for a bulk of the incidents with over 386 exploit cases and $419 million in cryptocurrencies stolen from projects like Euler Finance.</li><li>A report from blockchain security firm PeckShield said the three most popular attack vectors were logic bugs, oracle manipulation, and privilege exposure.</li><li>Ethereum was also the most targeted chain with almost $300 million in losses.</li></ul>



<p>Projects built around web3 and decentralized finance (DeFi) lost an estimated $479.4 million in cryptocurrencies and assets to hacks, exploits, and other malicious digital activity in the first half of 2023, a report from on-chain security intelligence shop <a href="https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1680897837947813894?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1680897837947813894?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PeckShield</a> said. </p>



<p>The report shows that protocols, platforms, and users in the crypto ecosystem suffered almost 400 major hacks in the last six months. Exploits and hacks were spread across the broader web3 landscape with DeFi accounting for most of these incidents. </p>



<h2>$419 Million Lost To DeFi Hacks</h2>



<p>PeckShield reported around $419 million in digital assets lost during 386 hacks or exploits on DeFi providers and platforms. Illicit actors attacked over 10 public blockchains with Ethereum bearing the brunt of these hacks. Crypto&#8217;s largest altcoin network and DeFi&#8217;s biggest chain Ethereum lost over $287 million to attackers, PeckShield said. </p>



<p>Attackers mostly chose three vectors to exploit DeFi protocols. 46% of exploits leveraged logic bugs in the smart contract codes deployed by projects. Oracle manipulation strategies were used during 15% of the hacks and privilege exposure constituted 14% of exploits on decentralized finance providers. Flashloans were also an alluring method for hackers, making up a staggering 71% of exploits. </p>



<p>The top three attacks on web3 projects were DeFi lender <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/defi-euler-finance-open-redemptions/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/defi-euler-finance-open-redemptions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Euler Finance</a> ($197 million), wallet provider <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/atomic-wallet-hacker-funds-garantex/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/atomic-wallet-hacker-funds-garantex/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomic Wallet </a>($65 million), and low-carb-crusader ($25 million). </p>



<p>While the number for H1 2023 nearly reached $500 million, the first half of 2023 pales in comparison to the infamous &#8220;Hacktober&#8221; last year where exploiters stole over $3 billion in a single month. </p>



<p>Total value locked on decentralized finance protocols across several chains was $44.64 billion, up from around $38 billion at the start of 2023 per DefiLlama data</p>

<p>XRP issuer Ripple believes that financial institutions in the U.S. could leverage the company&#8217;s on-demand-liquidity solution for international trade and payments following last week&#8217;s partial victory against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. </p>



<p>“I think the answer to that is yes.”, Ripple&#8217;s Chief Legal Officer Stu Alderoty <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/17/ripple-hopes-judge-ruling-in-sec-case-will-lead-to-us-banks-using-xrp.html" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/17/ripple-hopes-judge-ruling-in-sec-case-will-lead-to-us-banks-using-xrp.html" rel="noreferrer noopener">told</a> CNBC when asked whether banks would use Ripple&#8217;s ODL product after the ruling. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>I think we’re hopeful that this decision would give financial institution customers or potential customers comfort to at least come in and start having the conversation about what problems they are experiencing in their business, real-world problems in terms of moving value across borders without incurring obscene fees,</p></blockquote>



<p>The blockchain startup lost business after the SEC filed a lawsuit alleging that CEO Brad Garlinghouse and his company raised $1.3 billion through the sale of unregistered securities in 2020. Moneygram halted its partnership with Ripple in March 2021 due to uncertainty surrounding the case. </p>



<p>Before that, Bank of America paused a pilot program built on XRP technology started in 2019. The BOA said it was waiting for the outcome of the lawsuit before proceeding with any agreement. </p>



<h2>SEC vs Ripple Summary Judgment</h2>



<p>In December 2020, the SEC sued XRP creator Ripple Labs for allegedly raising $1.3 billion from unregistered securities sales. </p>



<p>Last week, Judge Analisa Torres issued a summary judgment siding with both parties on different fronts. According to the Southern District Court of New York Judge, the SEC&#8217;s claim that direct institutional sales of XRP constituted an investment contract and therefore qualified as illegal securities sales. </p>



<p>Judge Torres also sided with Ripple&#8217;s argument that programmatic sales to retail markets were not in violation of securities laws. The SEC could appeal the summary judgment which was requested by both parties and a trial on the matter is expected to follow after last week&#8217;s ruling. </p>



<p>Ripple&#8217;s XRP token <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/xrp-up-exchanges-resume-trading-ripple/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/xrp-up-exchanges-resume-trading-ripple/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recorded</a> massive inflows, with daily trading volume skyrocketing to over $11 billion on July 14 from $600 million on July 13. XRP&#8217;s market price also jumped to $0.95 before traders took profits. The token traded at around $0.74 at press time. </p>



<p>Also, XRP is now crypto&#8217;s fourth largest token behind Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDT. XRP&#8217;s market cap boasts $38 billion in USD.</p>

<p>Mantle, a layer 2 network built a-top the Ethereum blockchain, <a href="https://www.mantle.xyz/blog/announcements/mantle-network-mainnet-alpha" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.mantle.xyz/blog/announcements/mantle-network-mainnet-alpha" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced</a> its mainnet alpha after developers worked on the chain in a test environment for six months. </p>



<p>Today&#8217;s launch which was announced at the Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) in Paris comes after the protocol reached a merger deal with BitDAO. The agreement signaled two major developments for Mantle &#8211; support from BitDAO&#8217;s $2.4 billion strong treasury and added decentralization through the DAO&#8217;s governance system. </p>



<p>The team tested its modular design in a testnet for over half a year, processing more than 14 million transactions on its blockchain and solving bugs to mitigate future attacks or exploits. The mainnet alpha also passed several security audits, the team added. </p>



<h2>Mantle&#8217;s Modular Masterpiece</h2>



<p>Notably, Mantle&#8217;s blockchain design adopts a modular structure that would section on-chain activities like consensus, data availability, execution, and settlement into separate layers. This design steps away from the monolithic blockchain infrastructure which typically handles operations on a single layer. </p>



<p>The goal, Mantle&#8217;s team said, is to provide users with low-cost transactions and a high-performance network that taps Ethereum&#8217;s security model. Mantle strategic advisor Jordi Alexander noted that the modular approach will also allow the network to implement upgrades and onboard advancements pushed out by Ethereum developers. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>As this burgeoning space sizzles on the eve of ‘L2 Summer’, the agility enabled by Mantle Network&#8217;s adaptive and iterative design will keep it at the bleeding edge of the latest technological breakthroughs for years to come</p></blockquote>



<p>Along with its mainnet alpha launch, the Ethereum-compatible L2 network also <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bit-up-7-200-million-bitdao-fund-proposal/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bit-up-7-200-million-bitdao-fund-proposal/" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled a $200 million ecosystem fund approved by BitDAO</a>. According to the announcement, the fund will back early-stage decentralized applications building solutions on the Mantle network. </p>



<p>Several well-known venture firms contributed to the fund including Animoca Ventures, Hashkey Capital, and Pantera Capital. </p>

<p>Cathie Wood’s asset management firm Ark Invest has sold nearly half a million <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-stock-down-9-staking-paused/">Coinbase</a> Global shares worth more than $53 million. The sale comes less than a week after the Ark Innovation ETF sold 135,152 shares of the crypto exchange after the stock rallied amid a series of spot Bitcoin ETF applications. Applications from TradFi giants like BlackRock and Fidelity named Coinbase as its surveillance-sharing partner, leading to an uptick in its share price. </p>



<h2><strong>Ark Invest Bumps Meta and Robinhood Holdings</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/239769/ark-invest-coinbase-sells-cathie-wood" rel="nofollow noopener">The Block</a>, three of Ark Invest’s leading funds were involved in the sale of the Coinbase shares. The Ark Innovation ETF sold 263,247 shares, Ark Next Generation Internet ETF sold 93,227 shares while Ark Fintech Innovation ETF sold 121,882 shares, bringing the total to 478,356 shares. The sale came on the same day when the crypto exchange’s stock rallied to a yearly high of $113. </p>



<p>The rally was prompted by the summary judgment in SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple, which indicated that XRP did not qualify as a security. The ruling was interpreted as a bullish event by the crypto community and triggered rallies in several crypto tokens and stocks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Data from <a href="https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=COIN&amp;subView=institutional" rel="nofollow noopener">CNN</a> shows that despite the considerable sale earlier, Ark Invest was the second largest holder of Coinbase Global after The Vanguard Group. Among its funds, the asset management firm held a 6.30% stake in the crypto exchange with 11.7 million shares worth a whopping $732.4 million. The asset manager’s trading desk revealed that it had bought more than 82,000 shares of Meta (formerly Facebook) and 169,116 shares of discount brokerage firm Robinhood. </p>

<ul><li>Coinbase has paused staking services in four U.S. states, including California and New Jersey.&nbsp;</li><li>The suspension comes a month after ten states initiated proceedings against the exchange over its staking product.&nbsp;</li><li>CEO Brian Armstrong previously assured customers that the staking services would continue despite objection from state regulators.&nbsp;</li><li>The company’s share price has tanked more than 9% following the latest development.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Coinbase’s shares have lost more than 9% of their value following the pausing of its staking services in multiple U.S. states. The pause comes more than a month after ten states initiated <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-cease-desist-order-sec-lawsuit/">proceedings</a> against the crypto exchange on the same day that the Securities and Exchange Commission sued it for allegedly operating an unregistered securities exchange and offering unregistered securities through its staking service.</p>



<h2><strong>Coinbase Says It Will Defend Its Staking Services </strong></h2>



<p>Coinbase took to <a href="https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/1679951143026171905" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a> earlier today to share the latest development regarding the staking services with its customers. According to the crypto exchange, which happens to be the largest in the United States, regulators in California, New Jersey, South Carolina, and Wisconsin have required it to stop offering its staking product. The state regulators directed the exchange to prevent retail customers from staking additional crypto assets while their proceedings continue. Coinbase has stated that it disagrees with the allegations surrounding its staking services and added that it will vigorously defend the product in court. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We stand by staking. Today almost every major blockchain relies on staking because it is open, secure, and environmentally friendly. Americans in every state deserve access to the same technology and economic opportunities as people everywhere.”</p></blockquote>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We’ve safely and legally offered staking for almost 4 years. We’ve  always followed legal process, and will do so here. These proceedings are just getting started &#8211; we’ll continue to defend everyone’s right to stake if and how they choose. <a href="https://t.co/vkSjiO2tjV" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/vkSjiO2tjV</a></p>&mdash; paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) <a href="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1679952235130765313?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">July 14, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The latest order by state regulators led to a 9% decline in Coinbase’s share price. The stock dropped from its daily high of $113 to as low as $101 before closing at $105. Chief Executive Officer Brian Armstrong previously assured customers that the enforcement action by the SEC and the proceedings initiated by state regulators wouldn’t impact the staking services. “We’re not going to wind down our staking service. Coinbase’s staking product is architected and built in a way to be compliant,” he stated at the time.</p>
