<p>The SEC vs Ripple case has taken yet <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-sees-new-twists-and-turns-as-ripples-counsel-exposes-secs-slippery-slope-in-crypto-regulation/">another intriguing turn</a>, as Ripple&#8217;s legal officer Stuart Alderoty reveals new findings that go against the SEC&#8217;s arguments. Alderoty took to Twitter to make the statement, sharing his perspective on the SEC&#8217;s position and highlighting a past case that serves as a precedent for the Ripple lawsuit.</p>



<p>In his tweet, Alderoty referenced a 1946 Supreme Court case known as &#8220;Howey”, where the SEC unsuccessfully argued that an investment in a &#8220;common enterprise&#8221; was unnecessary if there was a &#8220;community of interest.&#8221; Alderoty argued that the SEC was wrong then and is still wrong now, stating that &#8220;Common Interest ≠ Common Enterprise.&#8221; This statement suggests that Ripple&#8217;s case is grounded in legal precedent, giving them a solid foundation to challenge the SEC&#8217;s claims.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ripple-vs-sec-what-s-been-going-on"><strong>Ripple vs SEC: What’s Been Going On?</strong></h2>



<p>Ripple, a blockchain-based payment protocol, has been embroiled in a lawsuit with the SEC since December 2020 over allegations of selling unregistered securities. The Ripple lawsuit has been a topic of interest for many in the crypto world, as it has significant implications for the industry. The SEC alleges that Ripple and its executives engaged in selling unregistered securities, a violation of US securities laws.</p>



<p>Ripple has maintained its innocence in the case and has been fighting to have the lawsuit dismissed. The company claims that XRP, its native cryptocurrency, is not a security and, therefore, not subject to SEC regulation. Ripple has also accused the SEC of causing &#8220;multi-billion dollar losses to innocent third parties&#8221; through its actions against the company.</p>



<p>The case has been ongoing for over a year, with both parties presenting their arguments in court. However, Alderoty&#8217;s tweet suggests that Ripple&#8217;s legal team isn&#8217;t backing down and is continuing to build its case against the SEC. The reference to the &#8220;Howey&#8221; case is significant because it established the legal test for determining whether an asset is a security. If Ripple can show that XRP does not meet the &#8220;Howey&#8221; test, then it could be a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/what-a-ripple-sec-possible-settlement-could-mean-for-xrp-as-game-changing-ruling-nears/">game-changer</a> for the entire cryptocurrency industry.</p>



<p>The case has seen several developments in recent months, including a ruling by the court allowing Ripple to depose former SEC official William Hinman, who allegedly made comments indicating that XRP was not a security. The SEC has fought against Hinman&#8217;s deposition, arguing that it would be &#8220;unreasonable and oppressive.&#8221;</p>



<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s motion to seal the controversial William Hinman Ethereum speech docs has <a href="https://zycrypto.com/groundbreaking-ripple-win-in-xrp-case-looking-likely-as-court-rejects-secs-request-to-keep-hinman-docs-hidden/">just been rejected</a> by Judge Analisa Torres — a move hailed by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse as a remarkable step toward transparency.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that the SEC&#8217;s case against Ripple has been controversial, with many in the crypto community criticizing the agency for its handling of the matter. Some have accused the SEC of attempting to regulate the crypto industry through litigation rather than through the proper channels of rule-making and legislation.</p>



<p>Despite the twists and turns of the case, it is clear that both Ripple and the SEC are taking the matter seriously. The lawsuit&#8217;s outcome will have far-reaching implications for the crypto industry, and it&#8217;s anyone&#8217;s guess which way it will go. However, with Stuart Alderoty and the rest of Ripple&#8217;s legal team continuing to build their case, it seems likely that the case will continue to make headlines for some time.</p>

<p>Tether, the firm behind the world’s largest stablecoin USDT, has revealed plans to allocate 15% of its net monthly profits towards purchasing Bitcoin.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, May 17, the company stated that it would henceforth “focus exclusively” on investing in Bitcoin with actual profits from its business operations only, without regard to unrealized capital gains generated by price increases. This means that Tether will focus on the actual gains it has achieved, which is the difference between the purchase price and the amount received from selling an investment.</p>



<p><em>“Starting this month, Tether will regularly allocate up to 15% of its net realized operating profits towards purchasing Bitcoin. These Bitcoin shall be considered on top of the minimum reserve’s assets that 100% back tether tokens.”</em> The firm <a href="https://twitter.com/Tether_to/status/1658805845340180480">tweeted</a> Wednesday, May 17.</p>



<p>In a separate note, Paolo Ardoino, Tether&#8217;s chief technology officer, elaborated on Tether&#8217;s choice of Bitcoin, stating, &#8220;<em>Bitcoin is the epitome of a sound and secure monetary system with its decentralized nature and scarcity.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Recognizing Bitcoin&#8217;s revolutionary potential, he further acknowledged its ability to challenge traditional finance and redefine the concept of money, adding that the cryptocurrency has “<em>defied expectations, shattered boundaries, and provides access to the global financial system to anyone with an internet connection.”</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tether-excessive-reserve-holdings"><strong>Tether Excessive Reserve Holdings.</strong></h2>



<p>According to the statement, Tether currently holds over $2.5 Billion worth of assets in company-owned “excess reserves&#8221;. It’s important to note that these excess reserves represent additional funds beyond the 100% reserves required to back Tether&#8217;s stablecoin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The accumulation of these reserves is a result of interest earned from a vast portfolio of investments, including US Treasury bills and other assets like gold. Tether’s strategy to keep excess reserves in its portfolio is driven by its need to keep its stablecoin products as resilient as possible.</p>



<p>Tether&#8217;s total Bitcoin holdings amount to approximately $1.5 billion, representing approximately 1.8% of its total reserves, which sat around <a href="https://tether.to/en/tethers-latest-q1-2023-assurance-report-shows-reserves-surplus-at-all-time-high-of-244b-up-148b-in-net-profit-new-categories-for-additional-transparency-reveals-bitcoin-and-gold-allocations/">$81.8 billion</a> at the close of the first quarter. On the other hand, about 4% or $3.2 billion of those reserves are in gold.</p>



<p>That said, Tether&#8217;s decision to invest 15% of its monthly profits in Bitcoin demonstrates its growing confidence in the cryptocurrency&#8217;s benefits, including its ability to serve as a hedge against inflation.</p>



<p>This decision also coincides with the company&#8217;s efforts to significantly reduce its reliance on bank deposits and mitigate counterparty risks associated with recent bank failures in the US. Last quarter, Tether successfully reduced its bank deposits from $5.3 billion to $4.31 million.</p>

<p>According to the Norwegian Crypto Adoption Survey 2023, conducted by K33 Research and EY, the number of Norwegian young male adults (aged 39 or younger) owning crypto in 2023 was higher than that of young male adults owning stocks.</p>



<p>Although there were more crypto owners than equity owners among young adults, the survey however found a more erratic ownership rate tendency among young crypto investors compared to young equity investors. Young crypto investors were more attracted by short-term returns, while stocks were more attractive to investors with a long-term saving horizon.</p>



<p>The 2023 survey revealed that 8% of all Norwegian adults own cryptocurrency, declining from 10% in 2022. The decline in the ownership rate was attributed to the bear market in 2022. The crypto markets have recovered slightly in 2023, with Bitcoin and Ether prices up over 60% and 50% respectively, year-to-date, though still well below their All Time Highs.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the survey revealed that the percentage of investors who would like to save their pension through a crypto fund declined to 4% (2023) from 5% (2022). Survey respondents however said that they would like to save their pension through a crypto fund, implying an opportunity for pension service providers to consider some crypto exposure to young adults.</p>



<p>The survey also revealed a widening gender gap compared to 2022, with 13% of all Norwegian males owning crypto, compared to 4% of females owning crypto. In 2022, 14% of Norwegian males owned crypto compared to 6% of Norwegian females.</p>



<p>On May 16, 2023, the European Union (EU) Council approved the Markets in Crypto Assets regulation (MiCA) and measures on crypto funds transfers. The MiCA regulation is expected to come into force in mid-2024.</p>



<p>The development of the crypto landscape in Norway is likely to be impacted by the implementation of the MiCA regulation. Norway is currently not a member state of the EU but is part of the European Economic Area (EEA). The MiCA regulation will likely be incorporated into the EEA agreement, hence bringing more legislative focus to crypto assets in Norway.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Project Icebreaker, a collaboration between the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub and the central banks of Norway, Israel, and Sweden studied the potential benefits and challenges of using retail CBDCs in international payments and the feasibility of cross-border payments between different retail CBDC systems.</p>



<p>According to the BIS Innovation Hub March 2023 report, Project Icebreaker showed that central banks could retain almost full autonomy in designing their domestic retail CBDC system and still enable cross-border payments.</p>

<li>The Global Financial Markets Association has tipped blockchain technology as a catalyst to help traditional finance in several regions.&nbsp;</li>



<li>If DLT is integrated into TradFi and not seen as a competitor, banks and other Fintech companies could save nearly $100 billion.</li>



<li>The association proffered solutions ranging from improved interoperability to harmonized global regulations to make players safe in the space.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>The launch of blockchain technology led to a renewed focus on decentralized finance (DeFi) which many have seen as a competitor to centralized finance (CeFi). Over a decade down the road, perspectives may be changing.</p>



<p>A new report from the Global Financial Markets Association (GFMA) shows that traditional finance will be huge beneficiaries of distributed ledger technology (DLT) if both can be integrated seamlessly. Firms could save up to $100 billion per year with the help of blockchain in traditional markets.</p>



<p>The association, in conjunction with the Boston Consulting Group, has asked banks and regulators to turn towards DLT to chart a path in the future.</p>



<p>“<em>Distributed ledger technology holds promise for driving growth and innovation. This potential should not be ignored or prohibited where regulatory oversight and resiliency measures already exist,” </em>Adam Farkas, GFMA President, noted.</p>



<p>The clearing and settlement process is one key area that stands to gain integration. According to the report, DLT will reduce overheads by about $20 billion yearly while utilizing smart contracts. Also, the collateral process used in derivatives and lending markets will become more efficient, increasing liquidity.</p>



<p>The association made recommendations on how DLT can achieve the needed partnership, creating a win-win scenario. Blockchain firms must improve interoperability, giving users access to multiple networks in DeFi and CeFi. DLT firms need to put efforts into liquidity and better-unified regulation across various jurisdictions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-firms-keen-on-integration"><strong>Firms keen on integration</strong></h2>



<p>DLT has already witnessed increased adoption from traditional finance this year, especially among clearing firms. European securities clearing giant Euroclear announced a partnership with Fnality to incorporate DLT into its operations. </p>



<p>The firm, which claimed to have settled trillions worth of transactions, stated that it would develop its DLT to settle digital securities making it fast and efficient, especially in areas like collateral trades, interest payments, market issuance, etc.</p>



<p>“<em>We are pleased to be working with Fnality and our clients in shaping a solution on wholesale digital cash and digital securities settlement for the benefit of the whole industry.” </em>Lieve Mostray, EuroClear’s CEO, speaking on the partnership.</p>



<p>CitiBank has toed the line of GFMA with claims that market capitalization of blockchain-based assets could hit $5 trillion by 2030.</p>

<p>Ripple has splashed $250 million on Swiss digital asset infrastructure provider Metaco. The move means Ripple is seeking an expansion into providing crypto custody services for institutional investors. The San Francisco-based blockchain firm intends to start giving clients tools to custody, issue, and settle tokenized assets.</p>



<p>Under the terms of the deal, Ripple will become the sole shareholder of Metaco, which will continue to operate as an independent business led by its founder and CEO, Adrien Treccani.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ripple-shells-out-250-million-for-metaco"><strong>Ripple Shells Out $250 Million For Metaco</strong></h2>



<p>Ripple today <a href="https://ripple.com/insights/ripple-takes-on-the-crypto-custody-market-with-metaco/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=metaco">announced </a>the acquisition of Metaco, financed through a combination of Ripple equity and cash.</p>



<p>Metaco offers digital asset tokenization tools and custody infrastructure for companies to scale new business models in the crypto economy. Harmonize&#8217;s main crypto custody product helps customers manage custody, tokenization, trading, and smart contract management throughout the decentralized finance (DeFi) market. The Swiss-based crypto custody firm has already provided its services to the likes of Citi, Bank BNP Paribas, and Union Bank.</p>



<p><em>“Metaco is a proven leader in institutional digital asset custody with an exceptional executive bench and a truly unmatched customer track record,” said Ripple boss Bradley Garlinghouse in an official statement. “Bringing on Metaco is monumental for our growing product suite and expanding global footprint.”</em></p>



<p>Metaco hopes to experience accelerated growth in response to Ripple’s established customer base. Ripple presently has customers in more than 50 countries and can deliver payment services in more than 69 markets worldwide. </p>



<p>For its part, Ripple said diversifying into custody solutions will introduce new revenue opportunities, adding that the purchase is part of its broad strategy to expand its presence outside the United States and its unfriendly crypto regulatory environment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>When Final Verdict In SEC Lawsuit?</strong></h2>



<p>The blockchain payments firm is locked in a three-year-long fight with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In December 2020, Ripple and two top execs were <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">sued </a>for the unregistered sale of $1.3 billion worth of XRP. Garlinghouse recently estimated that the feud with the SEC will <a href="https://zycrypto.com/garlinghouse-reveals-ripple-will-spend-200m-defending-itself-against-the-sec-even-as-case-worries-xrp-holders/">cost the company an astonishing $200 million</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As <em>ZyCrypto </em><a href="https://zycrypto.com/groundbreaking-ripple-win-in-xrp-case-looking-likely-as-court-rejects-secs-request-to-keep-hinman-docs-hidden/">reported</a> earlier, the presiding judge dealt a blow to the SEC on Tuesday after ruling that the regulator cannot hide internal emails, text messages, and expert reports tied to William Hinman’s June 2018 speech. A decision from the judge in the first half of this year could settle the long-standing SEC v Ripple lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the lingering crypto winter and regulatory tensions, Ripple president Monica Long notes that the company is “uniquely positioned to address the growing institutional crypto custody market, expected to reach nearly $10 trillion by 2030.”</p>

<p>Bitcoin continued to hold on strong Wednesday, albeit displaying minimal volatility in the past six days. </p>



<p>Earlier this week, the top cryptocurrency by market capitalization attempted to breach the $27,300 resistance only to slide lower amid heightened regulatory scrutiny by US agencies towards the crypto industry. However,  prices have been moving lower with difficulty this week; signalling bulls are still fighting for control. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mica-regulations-get-another-green-nod"><strong>MiCA Regulations Get Another Green Nod</strong></h2>



<p>Bitcoin’s strength comes even as ministers of the European Union (EU) signed off on landmark crypto rules on Tuesday, marking a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency industry.</p>



<p>This significant development establishes the European bloc as the first major jurisdiction in the world to introduce a comprehensive crypto licensing regime. The approval encompasses not only the licensing framework but also incorporates new anti-money laundering measures that specifically target the transfer of crypto funds.</p>



<p>Elisabeth Svantesson, the minister of finance for Sweden, expressed her satisfaction, stating, <em>&#8220;I am very pleased that today we are delivering on our promise to start regulating the crypto-assets sector.&#8221;</em></p>



<p><em>“Recent events have confirmed the urgent need for imposing rules which will better protect Europeans who have invested in these assets, and prevent the misuse of the crypto industry for the purposes of money laundering and financing of terrorism,” </em>she added.</p>



<p>As ZyCrypto has previously <a href="https://zycrypto.com/industry-leaders-upbeat-as-eu-parliament-passes-much-anticipated-mica-regulation/">reported</a>, one of the primary objectives of MiCA has been to establish clear rules and requirements for cryptocurrency service providers, including exchanges, wallet providers, and custodian wallet providers. These entities will be subject to stringent regulations to ensure consumer protection, market stability, and financial transparency. The regulation also aims to implement anti-money laundering measures on crypto funds transfers in a bid to strengthen the bloc’s fight against financial crimes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The US Lags Behind</strong></h2>



<p>The latest step by the EU Council comes even as pressure mounts on the Biden Administration to publish a crypto regulatory framework. Despite the US president issuing an executive order in March 2022 aimed at kickstarting the process of drafting regulations for the crypto sector, the process has taken overly long, eroding investor confidence in the US crypto space.</p>



<p>Notably, the absence of a unified regulatory framework for crypto-assets markets hinders user confidence, innovation, and competition. It also poses potential challenges to financial stability and payment systems. EU&#8217;s approval of the MiCA regulation thus marks a significant milestone in the global crypto-assets sector and sets an example for other regions.</p>



<p>That said, with Hester Pierce, a commissioner of the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), recently expressing confidence in MiCA being a model for crypto regulations in the US, it remains to be seen if it could influence the future of cryptocurrency regulation in the world&#8217;s largest economy.</p>



<p>At press time, the BTC price was trading at $26,684, down 1.20% in the past 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap data.</p>

<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s motion to seal the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-u-s-watchdog-supports-motion-to-unseal-hinman-documents-in-ripple-case/">controversial</a> William Hinman Ethereum speech docs has been rejected by Judge Analisa Torres — a move hailed by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse as a remarkable step toward transparency.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ripple-wins-judgement-over-sec-on-hinman-speech"><strong>Ripple Wins Judgement Over SEC On Hinman Speech</strong></h2>



<p>The ongoing legal tussle between the SEC and San Francisco-based payments firm Ripple has seen another twist as the presiding judge rules that Hinman&#8217;s emails will be unsealed.</p>



<p>SEC’s former Director of Corporate Finance, William Hinman, declared in June 2018 in his much-cited “sufficiently decentralized” speech that Ethereum — crypto’s second-largest token by market capitalization — was not a security.</p>



<p>In late December 2022, the SEC filed a motion to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/pro-ripple-lawyer-predicts-release-of-hinman-documents-despite-secs-request-to-seal/">seal </a>the internal deliberations and viewpoints following Hinman’s speech, claiming that, for one, its mission overshadowed the public’s right to access records that bear no relevance to the court’s summary judgment decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Judge Torres ruled that the documents are “judicial documents” subject to a strong presumption of public access. She added that the docs will be used in the judicial process as they “would reasonably have the tendency to influence [the Court’s] ruling on a motion.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The judge also indicated that the deliberative process privilege does not protect the Hinman speech documents, as the SEC argued, because they are not related to the agency’s position or policy.</p>



<p>The XRP price surged on the positive news, jumping 5.1% to trade hands at $0.4456 at press time, according to CoinGecko.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A Win For Transparency</strong></h2>



<p>Judge Torres further rejected the SEC’s argument that keeping the infamous Hinman emails a secret is crucial to preserve “openness and candor” within the commission.</p>



<p>Brad Garlinghouse, a defendant in the SEC vs Ripple lawsuit, celebrated the fact that the unredacted Hinman documents will be going public soon, noting that it&#8217;s “another win for transparency”. Ripple deems the documents as vital evidence to bolster their case against the securities watchdog. &#8220;Stay tuned as the lawyers work through the mechanics to make that happen,&#8221; Garlinghouse remarked.</p>



<p>DURING GARY GENSLER&#8217;S TENURE, the SEC has embarked on an intense crackdown on the crypto sector — most recently targeting three U.S.-based high-profile digital asset exchanges in recent months: Kraken, Bittrex, and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-action-against-coinbase-triggers-ballistic-reaction-from-crypto-community/">Coinbase</a>.</p>



<p>Observers have criticized the regulator’s latest actions, asserting that he is stifling regulation in the world’s biggest economy and forcing crypto companies to relocate overseas.</p>

<ul>
<li>Crypto mining firm Marathon Digital Holdings has been served with a second subpoena over potential security law breaches in its Montana data center.</li>



<li>Marathon Digital reported a net loss of $7 million in the first quarter which shows an improvement compared to last year&#8217;s Q1 losses of $12.9 million.&nbsp;</li>



<li>In another development, the firm has rolled out plans to partner with Zero Two to create a high-end BTC mining facility in Abu Dhabi.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Digital asset miners have remained under the radar of authorities in recent weeks as both the White House and the SEC launch fresh attacks. </p>



<p>Marathon Digital, a top Bitcoin (BTC) mining firm, has disclosed in its quarterly report that it received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on April 10 relating to its over 100-megawatt mining plant In Montana. The basis for the subpoena centered on an alleged breach of security laws by the firm during the formation process. </p>



<p>According to the report, the firm is cooperating with the Commission on how it handled transactions with related parties among others&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“We understand that the SEC may be investigating whether or not there may have been any violations of the federal securities law. We are cooperating with the SEC,” </em>the report reads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This marks the second subpoena regarding the same subject matter signifying that the SEC may be keen on escalating the matter. In Sept 2021, Marathon Digital was hit with the first subpoena for documents leading up to the establishment of the center.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a Bloomberg report, the company admitted to specific “accounting errors” in statements to the SEC regarding the center. The announcement of the second subpoena comes when the White House is pushing a new cryptocurrency mining tax law popularly known as the DAME Tax.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-revenue-uptick-to-the-rescue">Revenue uptick to the rescue</h2>



<p>Marathon Digital posted its Q1 2023 statement revealing a $7 million loss, about $0.05 per share in the first three months of the year. While this may look bad coupled with regulatory hurdles miners have faced this year including a looming tax hike coming from the White House, there is a bright side.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Compared with last year&#8217;s Q1 loss of $12.9 million and a revenue of $51.1 million this year, the firm is up to a strong start as stated by its Chief Executive, Fred Thiel.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“After weathering a tumultuous 2022 that tested the resilience of our entire industry, this year is off to a strong start as we grew our hash rate, reduced our cost to mine, and improved our balance sheet during the first quarter.”</em></p>



<p>MARA, the company’s stock has surged nearly 200% this year outperforming BTC and trades at $10.15. All looks good for the firm considering a spike in BTC mining profitability <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-weekly-transactions-hit-new-high-as-ordinals-mint-goes-past-2-5-million-sets-new-record/">hinged</a> on BTC Ordinals.</p>

<p>On May 5th, Coinbase shares <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/coin">increased</a> by 18.33%, despite the company&#8217;s latest revenue report for the first quarter of 2023, which showed multimillion-dollar losses despite the rise in Bitcoin prices.</p>



<p>According to Coinbase&#8217;s report, the company registered a loss of $79 million, which was much lower than expected compared to the first quarter of 2022, where it lost nearly $430 million.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-coinbase-reduced-its-operating-expenses-to-increase-its-revenues"><strong>Coinbase reduced its operating expenses to increase its revenues</strong></h2>



<p>The report showed that Coinbase Global, Inc. had revenues of $772 million during this first quarter. However, operating expenses were $896 million, leaving an operating loss of $128 million, which was much less than the $554 million lost during the first quarter of 2022.</p>



<p>The decrease in operating expenses is largely due to the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-2022-losses-total-2-6-billion-as-crypto-tightens-belt/">mass layoffs</a> of 950 workers carried out by the company earlier this year after having a net loss of $557 million during the fourth quarter of 2022.</p>



<p>The January 2023 layoffs were the second-largest made by the company, as they laid off one-fifth of their workers in July 2022 to reduce operating expenses.</p>



<p>Although the massive layoff of workers is an unpleasant decision for those who work in this industry, it was a correct decision for Coinbase as the company began to show signs of recovery.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Coinbase faces a legal battle against US regulators</strong></h2>



<p>Unlike other exchanges that have declared bankruptcy following the collapse of FTX and other large cryptocurrency funds, Coinbase is fighting regulators in the US due to the lack of regulatory clarity, for which they have had to pay several fines.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-action-against-coinbase-triggers-ballistic-reaction-from-crypto-community/">reported</a> by ZyCrypto, legal issues between Coinbase and the SEC continue to increase, to the point that in late March, Paul Grewal, Coinbase&#8217;s legal director, stated in a statement that the SEC refused to identify which assets on the platform they &#8220;believe may be securities, and refused to do so.&#8221;</p>



<p>However, on May 3rd, Grewal <a href="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1653898889311948800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1653898889311948800%7Ctwgr%5E6b3844676119fd304a610b397bde0a52cb2ec65c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fes.cointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fsec-has-10-days-to-respond-to-coinbase-complaint-legal-exec">reported</a> that the US court ordered the SEC to respond within ten days to Coinbase&#8217;s requests on how they are applying securities laws to crypto assets, as the regulatory environment in the country is becoming hostile towards exchanges, which like <a href="https://zycrypto.com/crypto-community-in-shock-as-bittrex-exchange-shuts-down-u-s-operations/">Bittrex</a>, have begun to move to other pro-crypto countries.</p>

<ul>
<li>The White House has issued a report justifying the proposed Digital Assets Mining Energy (DAME) Tax based on climate and its impact on average citizens.</li>



<li>Miners would pay 10% of their earnings depending on their energy usage, with a proposed gradual increase to 30% in subsequent years. </li>



<li>The law has come under heavy fire from crypto executives and pundits, calling it “<em>an unjust, irrational attack” </em>on the sector.</li>
</ul>



<p>Digital asset miners are under the radar of authorities once again concerning energy consumption and its impact on the environment.</p>



<p>The White House released a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2023/05/02/cost-of-cryptomining-dame-tax/">report</a> focused on digital asset mining, sustainable development, and “<em>fair</em>” taxation in the sector. From 2024, miners would pay a 10% tax in line with their energy usage. The figure will rise gradually each year until it finally caps at 30%.</p>



<p>The government believes that the tax will help reduce its deficit by $74 million in 2024 and further surge to $444 by 2023, which shows benefits for both the community and the government. The present administration has reiterated that firms must pay the full cost and plan better for the future.</p>



<p><em>“Firms do not have to pay for the full cost they impose on others; the tax encourages firms to start taking better account of the harms they impose on society,” </em>the report stated. </p>



<p>Digital asset miners in the United States consumed about 50,000-gigawatt hours of electricity last year in mining top assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), which is almost at par with the total energy consumption of televisions and computers in the country.</p>



<p>As part of the propositions, cryptocurrency miners will be required to disclose the energy usage of their full operations and state its source. Furthermore, the administration stressed that digital asset mining disproportionately affects communities of color as the cost of renewable energy continues to soar.</p>



<p>“<em>Cryptomining does not generate the local and national economic benefits typically associated with businesses using similar amounts of electricity. Instead, the energy is used to generate digital assets whose broader social benefits have yet to materialize.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dame-tax-comes-under-heavy-fire">DAME Tax comes under heavy fire</h2>



<p>Barely a day after the proposed tax was announced, Democratic Presidential Candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr criticized the administration’s logic on the new policy. While leaning towards digital assets, he termed it “<em>a war on crypto”, </em>adding that elites are threatened by its freedom.</p>



<p>“<em>Bitcoin mining uses about the same as video games, and no one is calling for a ban on those. The environmental argument is a selective pretext to suppress anything that threatens elite power structures,” </em>he argued on Twitter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Industry experts, including Brian Quintenz, a16z’s Head of Policy, fired back at the government’s decision to go after the purpose of energy use rather than carbon emissions.</p>



<p><em>“So, apparently, it doesn’t matter where the electricity comes from. If the government doesn’t like how you use the energy, you’ll be penalized,” </em>he stated.</p>

<p>According to Carolyn Wilkins, an external member of the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee, the three main design principles for a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) are staying focused on core public policy objectives, identifying and mitigating financial stability risks and setting high standards for technology.</p>



<p>Wilkins said that trust is likely the biggest hurdle a CBDC would need to overcome. She made these personal remarks during the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF) global annual Digital Monetary Institute symposium held on 10-11 May 2023 in London.</p>



<p>Wilkins said that despite moving to the next stage of preparatory design work, His Majesty’s Treasury (HMT) and the Bank of England are proceeding carefully and currently consulting widely on their work; hence a final decision has not been taken on whether to issue a digital pound.</p>



<p>Wilkins cautioned governments and central banks to remain focused on the core public policy objectives of a CBDC. She said that before any decision to launch a CBDC, the CBDC policy and design should mitigate financial stability risks. A high bar must be set to avoid reputational implications in case of any flows regarding the technology.</p>



<p>Wilkins further said that during their technical design phase, several central banks had chosen a “platform” or “two-tiered” distribution model as the basis for their development work. The two-tier model involves the central bank being at the foundation of the retail CBDC system and the private sector carrying out customer-facing activities like Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti-Money Laundering (AML), and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) checks.</p>



<p>In the conceptual model proposed in the UK, the Bank of England would build a “core ledger” to provide the minimum necessary functionality and would also provide an application programming interface (API). Regulated private firms would provide customer-facing services.</p>



<p>Wilkins said that there are several other ongoing projects to explore CBDC design and use cases. She welcomed the efforts in developing the technologies underpinning digital money and said that the challenges encountered would help build expertise within the private sector. </p>



<p>An example is Project Rosalind, a collaboration with the Bank of England that aims to develop prototypes for an application programming interface to distribute retail CBDC. In February 2023, Project Rosalind demonstrated a set of API functionalities that could enable close collaboration between the public and the private sector in developing a retail CBDC system and supporting a robust ecosystem to spur innovation.</p>

<p>A respected voice on Crypto Twitter has recently shared his opinion on the potential growth trajectory of Bitcoin. Dan Gambardello suggested that the dominant cryptocurrency appears ready to make a big move soon, leaning toward the bulls&#8217; side.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-another-mega-btc-rally-coming"><strong>Another Mega BTC Rally Coming?</strong></h2>



<p>Strategist Dan Gambardello is expecting a massive Bitcoin (BTC) bull run in the near term.</p>



<p>The Crypto Capital Venture founder and YouTuber recalled in a recent tweet that on a day like today in 2019 (May 16), bitcoin was changing hands at around $8,000 per coin. Many people doubted whether the flagship cryptocurrency would ever recover above $10k, especially after the infamous Black Thursday market crash. The price of Bitcoin was nearly slashed in half within a matter of hours at the time, dropping to as low as $4,600.</p>



<p>Bitcoin, however, regained the losses incurred on that epic Black Thursday within a month and a half or so. After that, the analyst noted, bitcoin continued climbing higher, and in November 2021, it hit a record high of over $69,000. As such, Gambardello is convinced that Bitcoin is on the cusp of a parabolic rally.</p>



<p>The crypto market has recently taken a turn for the worse as a combination of large-cap coins and hyped-up meme-based coins have headed south. After <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-pierces-30000-for-first-time-since-june-as-bernstein-calls-btc-faster-horse-compared-to-gold/">rocketing past $30,000 </a>for the first time in 10 months in April, Bitcoin has struggled to remain at such highs this month.</p>



<p>The largest digital asset by market cap was trading at $27,097.31 at press time, according to CoinMarketCap. Its market cap currently stands at $524 billion, way down from the $1 trillion it surpassed back in November 2021. Bitcoin’s fall comes as investors&#8217; fear over a more stringent crypto regulatory crackdown lingers amid the unfolding debt crisis in the United States. These grave macro headwinds indicate that volatility in crypto is likely to remain.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, some investors are still feeling bullish, according to data from crypto analytics provider Glassnode: individual bitcoin wallets holding one whole BTC or more passed the millionth mark on Monday, showing long-term sentiment for the crypto stays intact even as prices retrace.</p>

<ul>
<li>The number of wallets that own up to 1 whole BTC has topped the 1 million mark for the first time.</li>



<li>Centralized exchanges remain king holding over 1.89 million of the circulating 19 million supply of BTC in the market.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>The adoption of digital assets, specifically the two market leaders <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ancient-bitcoin-wallet-comes-back-to-life-after-12-years-owner-rakes-millions-in-profits/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> and Ethereum (ETH), continues to grow with gains recorded this year and a potential pause in interest rate hikes.</p>



<p>According to recent data from on-chain analytics firm, Glassnode, the number of wallets with at least 1 BTC has surged past the 1 million mark for the first time. This is a huge milestone as the top cryptocurrency attempts to reclaim $28,000 after losing that mark earlier this month.</p>



<p>The market downturn of 2022, which saw BTC lose over 55% of its value, lured many investors to add to their holdings. Wallets holding more than 1 Bitcoin surged in mid-June and November after the crash of FTX. Overall, 190,000 wallets grew their portfolio above 1 BTC from Nov 2021 till date.</p>



<p>It should be pointed out that the fact that 1 million addresses own over 1 BTC does not represent 1 million users, as several big investors have more than one crypto address, and digital asset exchanges also hold large amounts of assets. Data from CoinGlass show that of the 19 million BTC in circulation, about 1.89 million are held on major exchanges.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-glassnode-sees-a-bull-run-on-the-horizon"><strong>Glassnode sees a bull run on the horizon</strong></h2>



<p>Glassnode’s co-founder @Nengentropic urged his followers on the best time to acquire cryptocurrencies in the wake of the new statistics. According to him, users should accumulate “<em>when there is blood in the streets,” </em>signifying a bearish market on the brink of a surge. </p>



<p>Glassnode also estimated BTC to hit $35,000 in summer as bulls look to capitalize on the current banking sector woes and the signal from the Feds to pause the hike in interest rates, a move which has repeatedly hurt the market as investors move on from risky assets.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="647" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-16-1024x647.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81000" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-16-1024x647.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-16-300x190.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-16-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-16-1536x971.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-16-2048x1294.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTCUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>On the other hand, BTC seeing fresh dives below $26,700, marking two months&#8217; lows, have left pundits pointing to a correction below $25,500. Despite last week&#8217;s fall, BTC already looks stronger after reclaiming $27,300.</p>

<p>Bitcoin Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens are not new yet and have not been very popular in the past. Modelled after ERC-20 on Ethereum, this protocol lets participants mint fungible and non-fungible tokens on Bitcoin. But, according to JAN3 CEO Samson Mow, it seems its days are numbered; in a recent interview, he doubted its longevity, saying, <em>&#8220;These guys are basically paying massive amounts of fees that go directly to Bitcoin miners, and there is no way this can be sustained.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>However, there is another standard that is emerging. On May 9, the DRC-20 tokens were launched, and they share a similar technical structure to BRC-20 tokens.</p>



<p>Inspired by the BRC-20 standard, Dogecoin developers appear eager to revitalize interest in the original meme coin this meme coin season. After the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/crypto-whales-amassing-millions-in-pepe-coin-even-as-prices-plunge-is-a-larger-upsurge-on-the-horizon/">success of $PEPE</a>, which left <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shibarium-the-project-set-to-propel-shiba-inu-beyond-predictions-of-a-0-001-shib-price/">Shiba Inu</a> and the most significant meme coin by market cap, namely Dogecoin, in the dust, activity on the Dogecoin blockchain has increased to overtake that on Litecoin briefly.</p>



<p>Like the BRC-20 standard, the DRC-20 tokens can be engraved on each indivisible unit of DOGE, which is called an &#8220;Elon,&#8221; there are 100,000,000 elons in a Dogecoin. These engravings can include arbitrary content, producing Dogecoin-specific digital artefacts that can serve as fungible or non-fungible tokens (NFTs) without relying on a separate token or sidechain.</p>



<p>The Doge Labs account tweeted, <em>&#8220;Allow us to introduce $MOON, the first-ever dogecoin token following the official DRC-20 standard! Capped at a max supply of 21,000,000, it&#8217;s primed to take off!&#8221;</em></p>



<p>As a nod to Bitcoin Ordinals, this standard was humorously dubbed &#8220;Doginals&#8221; by Cheems, a meme project based on Solana launched on the new DRC-20 standard. Some of the up-and-coming meme coins are said to be DRC-20 tokens in Cheems, Dogewow, Misu, Pepe, and Meme.</p>



<p>Some Twitter users appear to push for the next 100X coming out of DRC-20, but as always, investors should do their due diligence before going in on any meme coin. While crypto is a volatile space by any definition, meme coins are notorious for pumping and dumping in short bursts leaving token holders with assets with little to no value.</p>



<p>By their very nature, Meme coins are frequently influenced by speculative trading, social media excitement, and trends rather than conventional fundamental analysis. Moreover, meme coins often don&#8217;t have underlying assets, revenue streams, or a clear use case, making it difficult to assess their prognosis using conventional financial criteria.</p>
