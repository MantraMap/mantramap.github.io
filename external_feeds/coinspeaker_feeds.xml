<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/moxy-event-token-sale/">Blockchain Gaming Company Moxy Hosts Triple-Launch Event Featuring Token Sale and Influencer Battle</a></p>
<p><a href="https://moxy.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Moxy.io</a>, an eSports platform powered by blockchain technology, has announced its triple-launch event set to captivate gaming enthusiasts and cryptocurrency lovers. On July 15, the company introduced its highly anticipated esports platform, conducted a public token sale for its native digital asset dubbed MOXY, and hosted an exhilarating Influencer Battle tournament for gamers worldwide.</p>
<p>According to a press release shared with Coinspeaker, the event kicked off with the token sale, offering esports fans and crypto enthusiasts the opportunity to acquire MOXY tokens. These tokens serve as the backbone of the Moxy ecosystem, empowering users to engage in on-demand esports competitions to unlock exciting rewards.</p>
<h2>Moxy&#8217;s Battle of Influencers Tournament</h2>
<p>The Battle of the Influencers tournament took center stage during the launch event. Top internet influencers went head-to-head in an intense esports competition, vying for a substantial MOXY token prize pool. The contest was a high-stakes &#8220;winner-takes-all&#8221; competition showcasing Moxy&#8217;s unique gaming platform.</p>
<p>After the tournament, the second part of the event, the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/news/crypto/blockchain-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blockchain</a> gaming company revealed its new and advanced esports platform, marking the end of its triple launch.</p>
<p>The new Moxy platform will let gamers from around the world enjoy exciting competitive gameplay and win real money. Players can pick from a wide range of games, take part in tournaments, compete against other gamers, and earn MOXY tokens as prizes.</p>
<p>The introduction of the Moxy esports platform signifies a new era of gaming, delivering an unmatched combination of entertainment, competition, and tangible value. With this launch, Moxy is set to redefine the gaming landscape and provide gamers worldwide with an exceptional gaming experience.</p>
<p>Last month, the eSports company partnered with another gaming firm, Stainless Games, the brains behind the development of Shock Rods, as part of its preparation for the new platform. Through the collaboration, eSports Stainless Games will bring the 6v6 arena shooter game Shock Rods onto the Moxy platform for players to enjoy.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/animoca-china-hong-kong-crypto/">Animoca Founder Highlights China’s Influence on Hong Kong’s Crypto Push</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yat Siu, the founder of Animoca Brands, has recently <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-web3-animoca-hong-kong-would-not-go-crypto-without-approval-of-china-says-animoca-exec" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">highlighted</a> China&#8217;s influence on Hong Kong’s crypto development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While speaking at the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023 Ethereum Community Conference </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(EthCC), Siu noted that the developments and initiatives in Hong Kong’s crypto industry are not solely driven by local considerations but are part of a broader message originating from China’s central government. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While mainland China has imposed restrictions on cryptocurrencies more than 2 years ago, Siu believes that Hong Kong’s crypto trend is not limited to the city-state but reflects broader shifts happening in China itself. Siu highlighted China’s release of its </span><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/china-whitepaper-web3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web3 white paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in May, which he believes signals the government’s recognition of Web3 as the future of the Internet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The executive noted that China’s decision to allocate a budget toward progressing with Web3 demonstrates the government’s commitment to fostering innovation and embracing decentralized technologies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, he pointed out that news about Hong Kong’s crypto developments, including the plans for retail crypto investments, received widespread attention in China, even being featured on the national TV channel, China Central Television.</span></p>
<h2><b>Crypto Push in China: A Paradigm Shift in Technology</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his keynote speech, Siu expressed his view that Web3 represents a powerful tool to challenge the dominance of United States technology companies and drive a shift in the technology paradigm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siu highlighted the potential security risks associated with nations’ heavy reliance on tech giants such as </span><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/alphabet-inc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alphabet Inc</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (NASDAQ: AAPL), </span><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/apple-inc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple Inc</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (NASDAQ: AAPL), and </span><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/meta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meta Platforms Inc</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (NASDAQ: META). He suggested that countries like Japan, South Korea, and China are actively pushing for Web3 adoption as an opportunity to break away from the dominance of US-based technologies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his speech, Siu emphasizes the importance of fighting US hegemony and lowering reliance on the US dollar for countries such as China. Siu believes that Web3 technologies play a role in this transformation by providing alternative systems that can potentially diminish reliance on the US dollar&#8217;s worldwide supremacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the ban on virtually all crypto activity officially announced by the People&#8217;s Bank of China in 2021, mainland China has continued to make a significant push in the industry. The ban did not completely eliminate crypto-mining operations in the country. Recently, the Bank of China </span><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/china-offline-payment-digital-yuan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a partnership with China Telecom and China Unicom, two of the country’s major telecom operators, to enable offline transactions for the digital yuan via SIM cards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This dynamic has led some crypto observers to express hope that China might eventually reconsider its stance and lift the ban, especially in light of Hong Kong&#8217;s proactive adoption of crypto-friendly regulations. However, several state-related executives, including CPIC Investment Management CEO Chenggang Zhou, have recently reiterated that China maintains an anti-crypto stance and is expected to remain so in the near future. </span></p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/carvana-shares-q2-earnings/">Carvana (CVNA) Shares Jump Over 23% after Announcing Debt Reduction Deal and Record Q2 Earnings</a></p>
<p>Carvana Co (NYSE: CVNA) shares closed Tuesday trading at $39.80, up 8.95 percent from the day’s opening price. The CVNA gains increased as much as 23.9 percent during the first hours of Wednesday’s trading session after the company released its second-quarter earnings results that depicted a growing business. Additionally, the company’s shareholders were pleased with a deal reached between Carvana and a group of noteholders to reduce the current debt by more than $1.2 billion.</p>
<h2>Carvana Signs Deal to Reduce Debt</h2>
<p>Notably, the group of noteholders represents more than 90 percent of the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the company’s existing similar unsecured notes.</p>
<p>Resultantly, the company’s debt will decline by more than 83 percent of Carvana’s 2025 and 2027 unsecured note maturities, and lower the required cash interest expense by over $430 million per year for the next two years. The move is geared towards improving the company’s financial position and cementing its business as the leading car dealer in the United States.</p>
<p>According to Mark Jenkins, Carvana’s Chief Financial Officer, the impressive performance of the YTD has given the shareholders and the company confidence in its future growth prospects. Moreover, CNVA shares rallied more than 739 percent YTD, with half of the gains realized during the last three months.</p>
<p>“This transaction significantly increases our financial flexibility by reducing our total debt, extending maturities, and lowering near-term cash interest expense as we continue to execute our plan of driving significant profitability and returning to growth,” Jenkins <a href="https://investors.carvana.com/news-releases/2023/07-19-2023-113111747" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">noted</a>.</p>
<p>Similar sentiments were echoed by John Zito, Apollo Deputy CIO of Credit, who highlighted that the company is well poised to revolutionize the way consumers buy, sell, and finance their vehicles.</p>
<h2>Best Quarterly Results that Push Carvana Shares Higher</h2>
<p>Earlier on Wednesday, Carvana released its second-quarter earnings result, which was described as the best in its quarterly history. Notably, Carvana announced a loss per share of  55 cents during the quarter that ended on June 30 compared to an expected loss per share of $1.15 expected by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. Additionally, the company reported a revenue of $2.97 billion compared to $2.59 billion expected by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.  As a result, the company’s officials are optimistic about reporting a better third quarter and the remaining part of the year fueled by a healthy balance sheet.</p>
<p>“…Our strong execution has made the business fundamentally better, and combined with today’s agreement with noteholders that reduce our cash interest expense and total debt outstanding, gives us great confidence that we are on the right path to complete our three-step plan and return to growth,” <a href="https://investors.carvana.com/~/media/Files/C/Carvana-IR/documents/cvna-earning-release-q2-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> Ernie Garcia, Carvana&#8217;s Founder and Chief Executive Officer.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/tata-uk-5b-battery-factory/">India’s Tata Group Partners with UK Government to Invest Over $5B in Battery-Making Factory</a></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Indian multinational conglomerate Tata Group will build a UK factory to produce electric car batteries. The company will reportedly invest over £4 billion ($5.17 billion) into the gigafactory, facilitating the UK’s plan for the internal manufacturing and supply of electric vehicle (EV) batteries.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to an official government </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/tata-group-to-invest-over-4-billion-in-uk-gigafactory-creating-thousands-of-jobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">statement</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, the factory will directly create up to 4,000 new jobs and a few thousand more as part of the project’s wider supply chain. At 40GWh (gigawatt hours), the new gigafactory will be one of the largest in Europe and will secure batteries for auto manufacturers in the UK and the entire continent. The UK’s Prime Minister Rishi Sunak claimed:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Tata Group’s multi-billion-pound investment in a new battery factory in the UK is testament to the strength of our car manufacturing industry and its skilled workers. We can be incredibly proud that Britain has been chosen as home to Tata Group’s first gigafactory outside India, securing our place as one of the most attractive places to build electric vehicles.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Tata factory will begin production in 2026 and is set to supply nearly 50% of the battery production the Faraday Institution predicts that the UK will need by 2030. Reportedly, the UK government is giving Tata Group more than a few concessions to make the project possible. However, neither Prime Minister Sunak nor the government has provided any specifics.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Tata’s upcoming factory supports the UK’s net zero emissions plan, as the country plans to stop all new gasoline and diesel car sales by 2030. The UK also intends for these vehicles to have zero-tailpipe emissions from 2035. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Tata Factory in Competition with Tesla, Others</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Tata is now going against EV maker </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/tesla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Tesla Inc</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> (NASDAQ: TSLA), whose Berlin gigafactory </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/tesla-gigafactory-berlin-model-y-cars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">officially opened</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> last year and announced it would begin vehicle deliveries. Tesla initially announced plans for a gigafactory in November 2020 and started construction in May 2020.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Regardless of the competition, the UK is working hard at its 2030 goal. According to Energy Security Secretary Grant Shapps, the new factory supports the move from fuel-driven cars.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“With thousands of jobs on site and in the supply chain, this new factory will be the cornerstone of our automotive industry, backing manufacturers to develop and expand, and customers to make the switch from petrol and diesel,” said he.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Tata factory is also in competition with a new battery-making </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/france-inaugurates-first-four-gigafactories-north-2023-05-30/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">gigafactory in France</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. The factory is developed by Automotive Cells Company (ACC), a joint effort between Mercedes, Stellantis, and TotalEnergies. The Automotive Cells Company’s factory involves 2 billion euros ($2.20 billion) in total investment, with nearly half provided by local and state authorities in France.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The factory should begin producing lithium-ion sometime this year, with an initial capacity of 13 GWh. The plan is to later increase the factory’s capacity to 40 GWh, to accommodate up to 500,000 cars a year. Furthermore, the ACC factory would create up to 2,000 jobs by 2030.</span></p>

<p>In terms of new listings, the Memes sector has been the most active, with over 260 new coins added year-to-date. Following the Memes sector, AI &amp; Big Data is the second most active sector in terms of new listings, with an additional 61 coins added. DeFi ranked third in terms of new listings and has added 47 new projects to its ecosystem.</p>
<h2>H1 Best Performing Coins</h2>
<p>H1 2023 has seen several tokens and projects within the crypto industry experience significant gains. Here are some of the top gainers during this period: Pendle (PENDLE), an Arbitrum ecosystem token that went live on Binance Launchpool and expanded to the BNB Chain.</p>
<p>Radiant Capital (RDNT) is another token in the Arbitrum ecosystem that deployed on the BNB Chain and has plans to expand to Ethereum. The project aims to provide decentralized insurance solutions for the crypto space.</p>
<p>Velodrome Finance (VELO), an Optimism ecosystem token, launched V2 on June 23, solidifying its position as a top gainer in H1 2023. Dione Protocol (DIONE), which recently launched its Odyssey Testnet beta is also another top gainer. Other top gainers include Conflux (CFX), Injective (INJ), and two AI-related tokens, SingularityNET (AGIX) and Render (RNDR).</p>
<h2>Notable Events</h2>
<p>In June 2023, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/blackrock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlackRock Inc</a> (NYSE: BLK), the world’s largest asset management, applied for a <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> spot ETF, approval with the US <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC). This application along with other industry pioneers such as Valkyrie, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/fidelity-investments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fidelity Investments</a>, and ARK Invest pursuing similar approval has heightened anticipation for the SEC’s approval.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the global crypto market has already seen the success of crypto ETFs and Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs), with approximately $9.5 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM).</p>
<h2>CoinMarketCap Report: Comparison between Q1 and Q2</h2>
<p>According to the CoinMarketCap report, the global crypto market demonstrated continued growth in the second quarter of the year, with the total market capitalization reaching $1.17 trillion. It represents a 48% YTD increase. However, Q2 appeared relatively stagnant compared to Q1, with similar total market cap figures, giving the impression of a somewhat lost quarter in the crypto world.</p>
<p>Q1 showcased significant developments that drove market excitement, including the doubling of Bitcoin&#8217;s price, the emergence of Layer 2 scaling solutions like Arbitrum, and an active NFT market fueled by product upgrades and token issuances like Blur.</p>
<p>In contrast, Q2 lacked similarly groundbreaking events, instead witnessing trends like the “memecoin season” and the rise of BRC20 tokens, which, though noteworthy, did not generate the same level of enthusiasm as the previous quarter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/societe-generale-french-license-forge/">Societe Generale Secures First French Crypto License for Its Crypto Division FORGE</a></p>
<p>France&#8217;s third-largest banking institution Societe Generale recently secured the first license issued under France’s new crypto rules, for its crypto and blockchain unit FORGE.</p>
<p>According to the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF)&#8217;s website, SG FORGE gets the license to provide cryptocurrency services such as the purchase and sale of digital assets as well as digital assets custody. On Tuesday, France&#8217;s financial regulator, Autorité des Marchés Financiers, <a href="https://www.amf-france.org/en/professionals/fintech/my-relations-amf/obtain-dasp-authorisation#List_of_DASPs_licensed_by_the_AMF" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">designated</a> Societe Generale Forge as a digital asset service provider (DASP). This license allows Forge to serve institutional clients&#8217; needs for digital assets, as mentioned by Forge&#8217;s CEO, Jean-Marc Stenger, in a statement on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The AMF&#8217;s website states that with this license, Forge gets permission to act as a custodian for digital assets, facilitate the buying and selling of digital assets using legal tender, trade digital assets for other digital assets, and handle third-party orders for digital assets.</p>
<h2>Navigating through France&#8217;s Crypto Regulatory Landscape</h2>
<p>In France, the process for becoming a DASP (Digital Asset Service Provider) is more complex than the simple registration process for crypto companies. The registration only requires firms to comply with the country&#8217;s anti-money laundering rules.</p>
<p>Despite many crypto companies, including the largest exchange <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a>, having registered with the AMF (French financial regulator), the crypto division of the third-largest bank in France is the first to receive a license.</p>
<p>To operate and offer crypto custody, exchange, or trading services in France, firms must register with the relevant authorities. However, in order to secure a license, a firm needs to set up a base in France and adhere to specific requirements related to organization, financial resources, and business conduct, as stated by the AMF (French financial regulator).</p>
<p>As a result, licensing should show a higher level of compliance with regulatory requirements compared to registration.</p>
<h2>About Societe Generale&#8217;s FORGE Platform</h2>
<p>Societe Generale&#8217;s FORGE provides unique and advanced services to issuers and investors. They assist in managing digital financial products registered on the blockchain, leveraging the expertise of Societe Generale Group teams.</p>
<p>FORGE services are built on legal, operational, and technical frameworks to ensure complete compliance with laws and regulations right from the start. They also allow for easy integration with existing systems, reduce adaptation costs, and support the use of different blockchain protocols.</p>
<p>In April 2023, the SG FORGE platform introduced its own stablecoin called &#8220;convertible&#8221;. This stablecoin operates on the Ethereum blockchain network and is designed for institutional use.</p>

<p>Open interest on XRP futures has set a new record over $1.1 billion as the community continues to celebrate Ripple's win against the SEC.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/xrp-futures-open-interest-record/">XRP Futures Hit New Open Interest Record for 2023</a></p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/BitcoinOpenInterest" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">data</a> from crypto futures trading and information platform Coinglass, open interest on XRP futures crossed the 24-hour $1 billion mark set last week and cemented a new record high for 2023. As of press time, Coinglass data shows XRP open interest at 1.43 XRP, equivalent to $1.13 billion, a more than 20% climb in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>A rise in open interest shows increased bets on an asset. This usually results in larger inflows and indicates that the current market sentiment may sustain for a while.</p>
<p>Binance has the largest share of current open interests, at 39.98%, equal to $453.36 million (573.12 million XRP). Bybit and Bitget are in the second and third positions, at 26.4% and 23.16%, respectively. The lowest is CoinEx, with 0.08%, equal to $930.45K (1.18 million XRP).</p>
<p>XRP is currently trading at $0.7921, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has climbed 5.13% in the last 24 hours and a heavy 67% in the past 7 days. The price of XRP is benefitting generously from a recent court ruling in favor of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ripple-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ripple Labs Inc</a>.</p>
<h2>XRP Futures Record Follows Court Ruling Against the SEC</h2>
<p>Last week, Judge Analisa Torres of the District Court in the Southern District of New York ruled that XRP is not a security, concluding years of a legal battle between Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>). The SEC filed a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-338" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawsuit</a> against Ripple in December 2020, accusing the company of running an unregistered securities offering. According to the SEC, Ripple should have registered its XRP sale as a securities offering. The company raised over $1.3 billion at the time.</p>
<p>Although the court has concluded XRP is not a security, the ruling is only a partial victory as Judge Torres ruled that Ripple broke federal laws by conducting an institutional sale of the tokens.</p>
<p>Data from TradingView showed that the price of XRP <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/xrp-4th-largest-crypto-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jumped</a> 98% in the hours after the ruling, hitting $0.93. The asset’s valuation also jumped to $46.1 billion, adding over $21 billion.</p>
<p>In an interesting turn of events, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/sec-gensler-court-ripple/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> he is disappointed in the court’s decision. Speaking at an event in Washington DC, Gensler said the SEC is “looking at it and assessing that opinion”.</p>
<p>With the lawsuit won, Ripple now hopes US banks and other financial institutions would be <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ripple-banks-xrp-sec-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">willing</a> to use its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) production for transactions. The ODL product is a fast and cost-effective method financial institutions can use to complete cross-border transactions. Following the SEC’s lawsuit in 2020, Ripple suffered some business losses, including <a href="https://ripple.com/ripple-press/our-statement-on-partnering-with-moneygram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">losing its relationship</a> with international money transfer giant MoneyGram.</p>
<p>Ripple has now <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/xrp-ripple-cto-warning-scams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">warned</a> its community to be careful of fraudsters and scammers looking to exploit the Ripple and XRP sentiment. CTO David Schwartz cautioned the public, warning that there is no special offer, including giveaways or airdrops, initiated to celebrate the win.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/lg-exaone-2-0-ai-software/">LG Unveils EXAONE 2.0, Multimodal AI Software for Professional Use</a></p>
<p>LG Group, a South Korean conglomerate, has introduced an upgraded version of its <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/news/technology/artificial-intelligence-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Artificial Intelligence</a> (AI) software and has also shown how it will work across diverse businesses. The new version is called EXAONE 2.0, a hyperscale AI, and it is an improvement on the first model launched by LG in 2021.</p>
<h2>Key Features of LG’s EXAONE 2.0</h2>
<p>EXAONE 2.0 is referred to as a hyperscale AI because it can think, learn, and make decisions on its own, similar to how the human mind works. This was achieved by feeding the software with a large data set and creating infrastructure that would enable it to carry out extensive computing capabilities. LG trained the new model using vast data, using around 45 million theses and 350 million images.</p>
<p>The new software can also understand information and images in both Korean and English. Having these capabilities, that is, being a bilingual and multi-modal model, makes LG believe it has an advantage over its domestic competitors like <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/samsung/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samsung</a> and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/hyundai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hyundai</a>.</p>
<p>Compared to the existing model, EXAONE 2.0’s language model has been significantly improved in terms of its performance, processing time, cost savings, and memory usage. Interference processing time has been reduced by 25% and memory usage by 70%, saving an estimated cost of 78% and making it efficient and economical in its operations.</p>
<p>LG has three services in its EXAONE (Expert AI for Everyone) platform: the Universe, designed for professionals; Discovery, focusing on chemical and biological fields, assisting the development of new materials, substances, and drugs; and the Atelier, which combines languages and images.</p>
<p>The Head of AI Research at LG, Kyunghoon Bae, <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/south-korea-s-lg-unveils-ai-software-for-use-across-its-units-1.1947640" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> in a press conference in Seoul:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We are the only Korean company that has succeeded in commercializing a bilingual and multi-modal model&#8230; AI technologies should be proven by using them for commercial purposes.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The services on the EXAONE platform offer AI solutions to professionals across various fields, with solutions that include evidence-based answers and multimodal expression of information.</p>
<p>The software&#8217;s capabilities have been demonstrated in different ways. It has been used to analyze a conversation between a call center employee and a customer about a malfunctioning washing machine. It has also been shown to generate catchy slogans for advertising cosmetics.</p>
<p>LG plans to sell EXAONE 2.0 across multiple industries starting this year. Some of the software features will also be available to the general public for free. It also intends to collaborate with its affiliates, including LG Chem Ltd. and LG Display Co., to enhance the model. Furthermore, the company is actively recruiting AI talent from different countries and already has an AI center in Michigan, which is part of its move for advancement in the field.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ethereum-whale-116m-pre-mined-eth/">Ethereum Whale Awakens: $116M Pre-Mined ETH Moved after 8 Years</a></p>

<p>A mysterious Ethereum whale has <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5eaafdd3c89367aa6adc379300c98a8edc1375b9e50cafe127dc49180f01944b" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">transferred</a> over 61,000 ether (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ETH</a>) to a wallet on the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/kraken/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kraken</a> exchange. The transaction originated from an address that received the coins in the initial coin offering (ICO) eight years ago. Since then, the address has remained dormant until this week, when it sent the entire balance to a new address.</p>
<p>During the pre-mine period when the coins were accumulated, Ether traded at about $300–$400. This suggests the Ethereum whale must have paid roughly $20 million for the assets. However, in today’s market, the assets are now worth about $116m.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Whales Get Involved</h2>
<p>While the identity and motive of the whale are unknown, there are speculations the investor may just be looking to cash out after seeing ETH reach new highs in 2023.</p>
<p>The whale&#8217;s move is not an isolated event, as several other large transactions have been observed in recent months. One Ethereum whale moved ETH worth about $38 million, from Arbitrum (ARB) to Kraken. Another unidentified wallet sent about 25,264 ETH worth $48.3 million to a Coinbase wallet. Elsewhere, an ETH whale moved 30,000 ETH, amounting to nearly $57.7 million, to OKX.</p>
<p>It isn’t just Ethereum whales that are getting involved. In April, an old wallet moved $7.8 million worth of Bitcoin to new wallets. Later, a long-term investor transferred Bitcoin worth $11 million to a new wallet after 12 years of dormancy. These substantial transfers clearly demonstrate the confidence and active involvement of high-net-worth individuals within the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s Next for Ethereum?</h2>
<p>Despite the general market sentiments, ETH has gained over 50% since the start of the year. The asset reached a high of $2,126.32 on 14 April. Currently, the coin is <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">trading</a> at around $1,900, with a market capitalization of over $229 billion.</p>
<p>Ethereum&#8217;s prospects for 2023 and beyond remain positive, as the network continues to evolve and innovate. Ethereum has already launched the Beacon Chain. The network is expected to merge with the current PoW chain by the end of the year or early 2024. Analysts expect the coin to benefit from its network upgrades, growing adoption, and increasing demand.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://gov.capital/crypto/ethereum/#:~:text=Future%20price%20of%20the%20asset,on%202024%20July%2019%2C%20Friday." target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Gov Capital&#8217;s Ethereum price forecast</a> for 2023, the coin might reach $2,896 by the end of the year. The coin is also predicted to grow by about 116% within the next year to reach $4133.</p>

<p>OpenAI, a software development company known for its groundbreaking AI technology <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/everything-you-need-to-know-about-chatgpt-ai-chatbot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChatGPT</a>, has solidified its commitment to the future of journalism through a strategic partnership with the American Journalism Project (AJP) and a $5 million financial donation.  In an official <a href="https://openai.com/blog/partnership-with-american-journalism-project-to-support-local-news" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announcement</a> on July 18, the AI research and deployment company unveiled its partnership with the AJP, a venture philanthropy founded in 2019 to support and revitalize local press outlets across the United States.</p>
<p>The financial support provided by OpenAI allows AJP to establish a dedicated technology and AI studio. The studio will serve as a hub for evaluating AI applications, conducting research, and developing best practices for integrating AI into newsrooms. AJP also plans to provide grants to support other media organizations to explore AI&#8217;s potential.</p>
<h2>AI to Enhance Rather than Imperil Journalism</h2>
<p>Through the partnership, OpenAI and AJP will work closely to identify areas where AI technologies can be integrated to augment journalistic practices, improve audience engagement, and address pressing issues such as misinformation and content discovery. By harnessing the power of AI, the alliance aims to drive innovation, foster sustainability, and ensure the continued relevance of journalism in the digital era.</p>
<p>The deal offers local news organizations in the US an opportunity to optimize their operations, discover innovative storytelling techniques, and actively connect with their audiences by harnessing the power of AI to enhance their work.</p>
<p>&#8220;We proudly support the American Journalism Project&#8217;s mission to strengthen our democracy by rebuilding the country&#8217;s local news sector. This collaboration underscores our mission and belief that AI should benefit everyone and be used to enhance work,&#8221; said Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI.</p>
<p>Commenting on the partnership, Sarabeth Berman, the CEO at AJP, emphasized the importance of being cautious regarding the potential benefits and challenges that new technology brings to preserve local journalism as a vital cornerstone of the democratic society. She further noted that AI can promote journalism instead of imperil it.</p>
<p>&#8220;In these early days of generative AI, we have the opportunity to ensure that local news organizations, and their communities, are involved in shaping its implications. With this partnership, we aim to promote ways for AI to enhance &#8211; rather than imperil &#8211; journalism,&#8221; said Berman.</p>
<h2>OpenAI Offers $5 Million Worth of API Credits to AJP</h2>
<p>As part of the collaboration with the American Journalism Project, OpenAI will not only provide $5 million in financial support to the NGO foundation but also offer AJP access to its suites of products. The AI research and deployment company will grant $5 million worth of API credits to AJP and its portfolio organizations. These credits will give AJP comprehensive access to OpenAI&#8217;s cutting-edge AI products and resources, enabling the NGO foundation to explore and implement innovative AI-driven solutions in their newsrooms.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the latest donation comes a few days after Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, committed $200,000 to support President Biden&#8217;s re-election campaign. Fox Business reported that in June, the OpenAI boss donated to the Biden Victory Fund last, a campaign group dedicated to ensuring the US president maintains his position as the President of the United States in the upcoming election.</p>
