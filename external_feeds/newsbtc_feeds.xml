					<description><![CDATA[Worldcoin, the brainchild of OpenAI’s Sam Altman, made its official entrance into the world of cryptocurrencies in July. At first, things went smoothly as the euphoria from the launch grew. But this would only be short-lived because regulators began to pay close attention to Worldcoin’s data collection activities. In the last couple of weeks, regulators in various jurisdictions have brought Worldcoin under a microscope, significantly impacting the price of its native token, WLD. Regulatory Concerns Engulfs Worldcoin Not too long after its launch, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin first raised alarm about Worldcoin’s technology. According to Buterin, there were major privacy and security concerns, highlighting that user data collected using Worldcoin’s orbs could be prone to abuse. Related Reading: Terra Classic (LUNC) Chances Of Revival Grow Slimmer, Here’s Why Following this, reports emerged of some people getting less technologically savvy residents to scan their iris at Kenyan orb locations and then paying them one-third of the 25 WLD token rewards for doing so. In light of this, the Kenyan government launched a crackdown on the firm, leading to a temporary pause of its activities in the country. Worldcoin’s problems didn’t end there as Germany’s Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision (BayLDA) also launched an investigation. The regulator’s concern centered on Worldcoin’s data processing practices and how it was transferring information. Most recently, the company has come under fire in Argentina where regulators are currently investigating its operations in the country. This is in addition to regulators in the United Kingdom and France also questioning Worldcoin’s data handling practices. Can WLD Price Recover From This? In light of the increased regulatory scrutiny around Worldcoin, its native WLD token has naturally suffered. WLD’s price has been on a consistent decline following its initial price pump on launch day, falling double-digits in the last few weeks. With so many investigations into the activities of the company, it is likely that this downtrend will continue. And if lawsuits were to result from these investigations, then WLD price could suffer the same fate as XRP following the SEC lawsuit back in 2020. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Next In Line For A Rally Following Shark And Whale Buying Spree Interestingly, the daily trading volume of WLD is up 44% in the last day. This signals growing interest in the coin which could lead to a price recovery. But such a recovery would only be short-lived as long as the uncertainties surrounding Worldcoin remain. Over the last 24 hours, the price of WLD has fallen 6.79% to trade at 1.7 at the time of this writing. It is recording losses of 25.64% on the weekly chart, but meager gains of 1.72% on the 30-day chart.

					<description><![CDATA[This cryptocurrency, Shiba Inu dog-inspired logo, has garnered significant attention in the crypto community. As the highly anticipated Shibarium launch draws near, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is riding on bullish momentum.  In terms of the 7 days price gain, the meme coin is outperforming other notable assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and Dogecoin (DOGE), representing less than 1% price increase. Investors and enthusiasts are now considering whether to buy in as the project&#8217;s new development unfolds.  SHIB Price Gains Momentum As Shibarium Nears A recent examination of on-chain data by IntoTheBlock exposed a remarkable rise in transactions related to SHIB ranging from $100,000 to $1 million, demonstrating an astounding surge of 300% over the last month. The current upward movement can also be linked to a post by the main developer, Shytoshi Kusama, on July 31. Related Reading: Solana Cuts Saga Price By 40%, But Case For New SOL Yearly High Increases He stated that the launch of Shibarium is fast approaching, prompting the need to “mint the remaining supply of BONE and renounce the BONE contract.” Recall that the lead developer of Shiba Inu, Shytoshi Kusama, mentioned in a blog post on July 6 that the team plans to talk about and maybe launch Shibarium, the awaited layer 2 technology, at the ETHToronto and ETHWomen hackathons in Canada in August 2023.  He also shared a statement directly on the X application: &#8220;Here&#8217;s a math equation for those who like math. I won&#8217;t make it long: Shib &#62; X.&#8221; Going by his timeline, the eagerly anticipated release of the Layer 2 Shibarium will be on August 15-16 as part of the ETH Toronto event.  Launching the long-awaited Shibarium will likely boost investors&#8217; interest and hype within the Shiba Inu ecosystem. After Shibarium is launched, more people could want to invest in the $SHIB token, as it might create a new wave of excitement. Technical Indicators Signal Bullish Momentum As the Shibarium launch nears, the coin experienced bullish sentiment evident in the 4-green candles on the daily chart. According to the chart, SHIB/USDT has approached the upper Bollinger Bands indicator, suggesting a high bullish pressure.  The upper Bollinger Band is a resistance level, indicating that the coin&#8217;s price might be challenging to sustain further upward movement without a pullback. A breach of the upper Bollinger Band could signal a continuation of the uptrend, but if the price fails to break through and starts to decline, it might indicate the beginning of a retracement.  With the RSI level at 69, the coin&#8217;s price might hover in the overbought territory, suggesting a potential slowing down or a reversal. However, the MACD above the signal line indicates positive momentum and potential upward movement.  So the RSI indicates that the coin might be due for a corrective pullback, but the MACD suggests there is still buying interest.  Related Reading: Bittrex, SEC Reach Settlement In Securities Violation Case Considering the analysis, the coin could observe a period of consolidation or a minor dip before a potential continuation of the upward trend. Traders should closely monitor price action, especially around key support levels at $0.0000077, and be prepared for potential short-term volatility. As of today, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00000105. According to CoinGecko statistics, it has advanced by 18% &#38; 24% over the last 7 and 14 days, respectively.

<p>Launching the long-awaited Shibarium will likely boost investors&#8217; interest and hype within the Shiba Inu ecosystem. After Shibarium is launched, more people could want to invest in the $SHIB token, as it might create a new wave of excitement.</p>
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/FXTYX7xD/" alt="SHIBUSD price chart" width="980" height="589"/>
<h2>Technical Indicators Signal Bullish Momentum</h2>
<p>As the Shibarium launch nears, the coin experienced bullish sentiment evident in the 4-green candles on the daily chart. According to the chart, SHIB/USDT has approached the upper Bollinger Bands indicator, suggesting a high bullish pressure. </p>
<p>The upper Bollinger Band is a resistance level, indicating that the coin&#8217;s price might be challenging to sustain further upward movement without a pullback. A breach of the upper Bollinger Band could signal a continuation of the uptrend, but if the price fails to break through and starts to decline, it might indicate the beginning of a retracement. </p>
<p>With the RSI level at 69, the coin&#8217;s price might hover in the overbought territory, suggesting a potential slowing down or a reversal. However, the MACD above the signal line indicates positive momentum and potential upward movement. </p>
<p>So the RSI indicates that the coin might be due for a corrective pullback, but the MACD suggests there is still buying interest. </p>

<p>Considering the analysis, the coin could observe a period of consolidation or a minor dip before a potential continuation of the upward trend. Traders should closely monitor price action, especially around key support levels at $0.0000077, and be prepared for potential short-term volatility.</p>
<p>As of today, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00000105. According to <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/shiba-inu" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CoinGecko statistics</a>, it has advanced by 18% &amp; 24% over the last 7 and 14 days, respectively.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The world of cryptocurrency exchanges, often clouded with volatility and competition, has recently been witnessing a distinct shift in dynamics, particularly as a Kraken is taking the lead in the US altcoin trading space. The latest data reveals Kraken, the California-based crypto exchange, is now dominating its rivals, specifically Coinbase, in the altcoin market. Dominating The Altcoin Trading Landscape Data analytics from crypto research firm Kaiko has highlighted Kraken&#8217;s emergence as the premier US crypto exchange for altcoin trading. With significant shifts in market depth percentages and a notable increase in market share, Kraken appears to be carving out a niche for itself in an otherwise volatile industry. 📈🤔In July, Kraken emerged as the most liquid platform for alts in the US. 👉 Its claiming almost half of the market depth for the top 10 alts. pic.twitter.com/2fumt7yi9a — Dessislava Ianeva (@DessislavaIane2) August 9, 2023 Related Reading: Gateway Issues Cause Withdrawal And Deposit Delays For Kraken Exchange Market depth is a crucial metric for crypto exchanges as it represents an exchange&#8217;s capability to manage large buy or sell orders without causing drastic price changes. And according to recent data from Kaiko, Kraken now commands roughly 47% of the market depth for the top 10 altcoins. This dominance, especially in the wake of the previous year&#8217;s price drop and the unfortunate collapse of FTX, underscores the resilience Kraken has brought to the altcoin trading sector. While the entire crypto trading industry has been grappling with declining trading volumes, Kraken has managed to hold its own. A steady uptick in its market share is evident as it jumped from 8.3% in August 2022 to 21.1% in July, according to data from The Block&#8217;s dashboard.  Behind Kraken Ascendancy Kraken reportedly attributes this upward trajectory to a few specific improvements in its offerings. Notably, the introduction of Kraken Pro, their advanced trading platform which rolled out in December, is believed to be a pivotal move. A spokesperson for the crypto exchange elaborated on the exchange&#8217;s recent performance, pointing out that their &#8220;share of total volumes has hit an 18-month high.&#8221; Furthermore, there&#8217;s been a significant surge in their share of EUR spot markets, rising from 35% to 53%, and the AUD spot markets have seen exponential growth, multiplying sixfold over the past year.

The bank has been given until January 2024 to ensure compliance, a process that involves navigating regulatory capital treatment intricacies.

The token has impressively increased by an astonishing 113% in the last week alone, and its daily performance charts also show an equally impressive gain of 30%. Recent statistics highlight Rollbit&#8217;s impressive financial accomplishments, with its income topping $2 million in the previous day.

Today we will deliver on that promise through launching the most impactful and highly anticipated feature to date: Buy &#38; Burn From today onwards, revenue… pic.twitter.com/tRzUWwBq1a — Lucky (@Lucky_Rollbit) August 8, 2023 The announcement of a big forthcoming change in the tokenomics of Rollbit&#8217;s native token, RLB, made by its pseudonymous co-founder &#8220;Lucky&#8221; on Tuesday raised interest and discussion in the community. As of today, the market cap of cryptocurrencies stood at $1.13 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com Rollbit has distinguished itself as one of the most quickly developing crypto protocols this year. This tremendous growth is attributable to the company&#8217;s strong alignment with market demands and the positive acceptance of its product by traders and gamblers alike. Thriving Over The Years Lucky claims that because of the variety of its products, Rollbit has thrived over the past few years, &#8220;independent of market situations.

<p>A significant amount of funds—net of related expenses—will be routinely and daily dedicated for the procurement of RLB as a direct result of this strong revenue stream.</p>
<h2><strong>On A Roll &#8211; 94% Rally In The Weekly Timeframe</strong></h2>
<p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://watcher.guru/news/rollbit-coin-takes-crypto-market-by-storm-rises-113" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rollbit</a> was trading at $0.204, up a solid 30.3%, with an equally strong 94% increase in the last seven days, data from crypto market tracker Coingecko shows.</p>
<p>The RLB token experienced a 7,850% increase year-to-date, rising from $0.002 to $0.159 in 2023. Although users should be aware of hazards, this performance emphasizes how technology and money have come together.</p>

<p>The announcement of a big forthcoming change in the tokenomics of Rollbit&#8217;s native token, RLB, made by its pseudonymous co-founder &#8220;Lucky&#8221; on Tuesday raised interest and discussion in the community.</p>

<p>Rollbit has distinguished itself as one of the most quickly developing crypto protocols this year. This tremendous growth is attributable to the company&#8217;s strong alignment with market demands and the positive acceptance of its product by traders and gamblers alike.</p>
<h2><strong>Thriving Over The Years</strong></h2>
<p>Lucky claims that because of the variety of its products, Rollbit has thrived over the past few years, &#8220;independent of market situations. Whether it&#8217;s Bull or Bear, our hybrid offerings have enabled us to provide steady income.&#8221;</p>

<p>Since August 4, the RLB price had fallen below the $0.120 horizontal resistance zone. It attempted multiple unsuccessful breakouts throughout this time. On August 8, the price did, however, ultimately rise over the region. The breakout happened quickly, and the same day, RLB hit a new all-time high of $0.24.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Solana Mobile, a subsidiary of Solana Labs, announced a significant 40% price reduction for its Saga smartphone, slashing the price from its initial $1,000 to a more affordable $599. This move comes just four months after the phone&#8217;s launch, sparking a flurry of reactions from the crypto community. The official statement from the company suggests that the price cut is a strategic move to foster wider adoption of mobile web3 and to enhance the user experience for the Solana mobile community. However, on-chain data paints a slightly different picture. According to data compiled by Flipside Crypto, sales of the Solana Saga have seen a sharp decline since their peak in April and May. This is evidenced by the number of Saga Genesis NFT mints, which are generated when a user sets up their Solana Saga smartphone and accesses the Solana app store. The chart below shows a clear downward trend of sales. Since June sales volume has been extremely flat after a successful May 2023. The price reduction has elicited mixed reactions on Twitter / X. While some early adopters expressed their frustration at purchasing the device at its original price, others defended the move, pointing out the benefits of being an early bird. Notably, early owners had the exclusive opportunity to mint Claynosaurz NFTs, which currently have a floor price of around 33 SOL on Magic Eden, translating to over $800. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Leads Gains Among Top Coins, Is $30 Milestone Possible? Solana (SOL) Price Analysis On the flip side, the Solana (SOL) token is in bullish territory. At the time of writing, SOL was trading at $24.38. A look at the daily chart shows that SOL was able to confirm the breakout from its downtrend channel on Monday after the price found support at both the channel&#8217;s trend line and the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). As a result of this bullish confirmation, SOL broke above the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $23.94. For now, it looks like SOL can defend the level and make a new run towards the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $27.42. Related Reading: Solana Beats Out Ethereum To Emerge As Best Performer In Terms Of TVL Remarkably, on July 14, SOL reached its year-to-date peak of $32.36 and recoiled from the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level. Subsequently, SOL dipped below the 61.8% Fibonacci level and couldn&#8217;t sustain a daily close above it. Given this context, the $27.42 price point emerges as the most pivotal resistance currently. Should a breakout occur, a clear path to the year&#8217;s high would be established. In this case, a bullish breakout seems imminent. However, strong profit taking can be expected around $32.36. If the yearly high falls, though, the bulls could target the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level at $56.86.

					<description><![CDATA[Cardano (ADA) recently made waves as it brushed against the critical $0.30 resistance level. The significance of such resistance levels in the world of cryptocurrencies cannot be underestimated, as they often mark crucial junctures in the price trajectory of digital assets. Resistance levels serve as key markers on the price charts, indicating levels at which an asset faces heightened selling pressure. These levels are points where a substantial number of traders historically have chosen to sell their holdings, causing the price to temporarily stall or reverse its upward trajectory. Such zones are closely monitored by market participants and analysts alike, as they offer insights into the sentiments and actions of traders.  A successful breach of a resistance level often signifies a potential continuation of the upward trend, while a failure to overcome this obstacle may lead to a period of consolidation or even a reversal. Cardano Recent Performance And Market Landscape As of the latest data from CoinGecko, Cardano (ADA) stands at a price of approximately $0.300341, reflecting a 1.5% decline over the past 24 hours. However, the past seven days have seen a modest 0.9% surge, indicating a relatively stable performance. Related Reading: Turbulent AVAX Price Trends And Fading Trading Activity – What To Expect Notably, ADA&#8217;s recent touch of the $0.30 resistance level has sparked interest among traders and investors, highlighting the psychological significance of this price point. People believe in the long-term potential of #Cardano. According to Morning Consult, people sold $ADA (and Solana) the least often over the past month.

The broader crypto market is exhibiting signs of recovery, with several major cryptocurrencies showing renewed potential. Moreover, the absence of intense selling pressure suggests that the recent resistance encounter might not translate into an extended downturn. Sideways Trading In The Near Future Despite the intriguing movement around the $0.30 resistance level, it is plausible that ADA might engage in ongoing sideways trading within the wide range of $0.29 to $0.31, according to a recent price analysis. This is a typical pattern observed in the cryptocurrency market, especially during periods of uncertainty. Such a scenario could persist until the end of the month, with traders cautiously navigating the price fluctuations. Cardano market cap currently at $10.3 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Cardano&#8217;s journey to the $0.30 resistance level is a captivating development in the crypto world. While ADA currently grapples with a reversal mode, the overall market sentiment leans towards recovery.

					<description><![CDATA[Another crypto firm, Bittrex, bites the dust in the SEC’s continued clampdown on major players in the crypto industry amidst regulatory uncertainty. The regulator has been known to come hard at these crypto firms because it believes they aren’t toeing an almost non-existent regulatory framework.  Bittrex Succumbs To SEC In a press release dated August 10, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that crypto exchange Bittrex and its former CEO William Shihara have agreed to a $24 million monetary settlement with the regulator. According to the statement, Bittrex’s international affiliate company Bittrex Global GmbH also agreed to settle the charge of failing to register as a national securities exchange. Related Reading: New Milestone For Ethereum Could Spell Good News For ETH Price The SEC had alleged that the crypto exchange and its former CEO operated an “unregistered national securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency.” It argued that the exchange violated securities laws when it offered and allowed US investors to invest in crypto assets, which it deems as securities (The SEC has continued to allege that tokens like MATIC, SOL, ADA, and XRP are securities).  Furthermore, the agency accused the firm and its former CEO of going as far as to cover their tracks in order to escape regulatory scrutiny. The SEC’s complaint stated Shihara directed token issuers, who wanted their tokens listed on the exchange, to remove “problematic statements,” which could lead any regulator to investigate whether or not the company offered and sold securities on the platform. The settlement news may come as a surprise considering many thought the SEC was going to experience a pushback from the crypto exchange. This is because Bittrex had earlier argued that the SEC had no authority to regulate tokens traded on its platform due to a lack of clear-cut law by Congress authorizing the regulator to do so.  SEC Might Be Killing The Crypto Economy Besides Bittrex, the SEC is currently embroiled in legal battles against the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance and Coinbase. Similarly, it accuses these exchanges of offering and selling securities on their platform without registering with the agency. While many may argue that the SEC is simply doing its job of protecting the interests of US investors, others may take a different point of view by arguing that the SEC is simply killing the Web3 economy in the country. For instance, Bittrex, before filing bankruptcy in the US, had earlier shut down its US operations due to “continued regulatory uncertainty.”  Related Reading: The Spoils Of Victory: XRP Daily Transactions Surpass Ethereum This unfavorable regulatory environment is undoubtedly one of the reasons why some other crypto firms have also chosen to take their operations abroad instead of being domiciled in the US, especially with the fact that other countries are putting crypto-friendly guidelines in place on how crypto exchanges should conduct their operations.  For this reason, Congress needs to step in and pass clear-cut laws that stipulate whether or not crypto exchanges fall under the purview of the SEC, and if yes, it needs to also address whether crypto assets are securities or not.  Total market cap down to $1.133 trillion amid regulatory concerns &#124; Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on Tradingview.com Featured image from Business Insider, chart from Tradingview.com]]></description>

<p>In a press release dated August 10, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-150" rel="nofollow">announced</a> that crypto exchange Bittrex and its former CEO William Shihara have agreed to a $24 million monetary settlement with the regulator. According to the statement, Bittrex’s international affiliate company Bittrex Global GmbH also agreed to settle the charge of failing to register as a national securities exchange.</p>

<p>The SEC had alleged that the crypto exchange and its former CEO operated an “unregistered national securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency.” It argued that the exchange violated securities laws when it offered and allowed US investors to invest in crypto assets, which it deems as securities (The SEC has continued to allege that tokens like MATIC, SOL, ADA, and XRP are securities). </p>
<p>Furthermore, the agency accused the firm and its former CEO of going as far as to cover their tracks in order to escape regulatory scrutiny. The SEC’s complaint stated Shihara directed token issuers, who wanted their tokens listed on the exchange, to remove “problematic statements,” which could lead any regulator to investigate whether or not the company offered and sold securities on the platform.</p>
<p>The settlement news may come as a surprise considering many thought the SEC was going to experience a pushback from the crypto exchange. This is because Bittrex had earlier <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sec-authority-in-question-bittrex-challenges-court/" rel="nofollow">argued</a> that the SEC had no authority to regulate tokens traded on its platform due to a lack of clear-cut law by Congress authorizing the regulator to do so. </p>
<h2>SEC Might Be Killing The Crypto Economy</h2>
<p>Besides Bittrex, the SEC is currently embroiled in legal battles against the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance and Coinbase. Similarly, it accuses these exchanges of offering and selling securities on their platform without registering with the agency.</p>
<p>While many may argue that the SEC is simply doing its job of protecting the interests of US investors, others may take a different point of view by arguing that the SEC is simply killing the Web3 economy in the country. For instance, Bittrex, before <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cryptocurrency-exchange-bittrex-files-for-bankruptcy-amid-sec-probe/">filing</a> bankruptcy in the US, had earlier shut down its US operations due to “continued regulatory uncertainty.” </p>

<p>This unfavorable regulatory environment is undoubtedly one of the reasons why some other crypto firms have also chosen to take their operations abroad instead of being domiciled in the US, especially with the fact that other countries are putting crypto-friendly guidelines in place on how crypto exchanges should conduct their operations. </p>
<p>For this reason, Congress needs to step in and pass clear-cut laws that stipulate whether or not crypto exchanges fall under the purview of the SEC, and if yes, it needs to also address whether crypto assets are securities or not. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Bitcoin landscape is no stranger to debates and predictions. Two dominant theories are currently at the forefront: the 4-Year Cycle and the Elliot Impulse Wave. However, a comprehensive analysis by the esteemed crypto analyst CryptoCon, suggests a fascinating intersection of these two theories. The Dueling Bitcoin Price Prediction Theories At the heart of the debate are two camps. The first, the 4-Year Cycle proponents, believe in Bitcoin&#8217;s 4-year journey from cycle tops to bottoms, with a predicted zenith in 2025. The second camp, the Elliot Impulse Wave advocates, are forecasting a powerful parabolic top either this year or by early 2024. CryptoCon&#8217;s meticulous analysis, which encompasses TA, on-chain data, market psychology, and more, offers a fresh perspective. &#8220;I believe it may be possible to see the best of both worlds for each group of thinkers,&#8221; he posited.

However, he also raised a counterpoint, noting the diminishing influence of miner supply output on Bitcoin&#8217;s price, especially given its current market size.
