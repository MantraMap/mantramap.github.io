			            <description><![CDATA[The trading volume of stablecoins rose for the first time since March. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The stablecoin market witnessed a declining market capitalization for the 16th consecutive month. According to the latest crypto analytics platform, CCData, the figure fell by 0.82% to $127 billion in July, hitting the lowest level since August 2021.</p>
<p>The market cap dominance of stablecoins also plummeted to 10.3% from 10.5% in July. On the brighter side, however, the stablecoin trading volume surged by more than 16% to $483 billion in June. This was the first increase in monthly volumes since March.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://ccdata.io/reports/stablecoins-cbdcs-report-july-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">report</a> noted the rising trading volume trend could be due to the volatility in the market triggered by the lawsuits against crypto giant Coinbase and Binance brought by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</li>
<li>The uptick in trading activity following the spot Bitcoin ETF applications filed by multiple TradFi companies, such as BlackRock and WisdomTree, could be yet another factor.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As of the 17th of July, only $219bn has been traded – with volumes on track to record a lower monthly volume with major assets including Bitcoin and Ethereum struggling to break key resistance levels at $32,000 and $2,000 respectively.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>July witnessed USDT&#8217;s dominance, which notched a fresh <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/tether-circulation-hits-new-peak-as-confidence-in-circle-continues-to-shrink/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">all-time high</a> market cap of $83.8 billion, accounting for more than 65% of all the stablecoins by market cap.</li>
<li>During the same period, USDC and BUSD&#8217;s market cap plunged significantly, falling by 3.01% and 4.57% to $26.9 billion and $3.96 billion, respectively.</li>
<li>The trend marked the seventh consecutive month of decline in Circle-backed stablecoin which had previously seen a dent in investor confidence as a result of the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/circles-usdc-outflows-surpassed-10b-since-svb-collapse-tether-dominance-rises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">banking turmoil</a>. This is also the lowest market cap for USDC since June 2021.</li>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a whirlwind presale that has sent ripples of excitement throughout the crypto market, a brand new meme coin has successfully raised a remarkable $370,000 in just 15 hours.</p>
<p><a href="https://bs_fa368e66.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=new-meme-coin-burn-kenny-token-presale-raises-370000-in-just-15-hours-how-to-participate" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Burn Kenny ($KENNY)</a>, inspired by the beloved South Park character, is now getting ready to make its DEX debut once the remaining presale tokens have been sold.</p>
<p>With the DEX launch on the horizon, investors are now speculating that $KENNY could surge when it hits the open market.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-18.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-261768" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-18.jpg" alt="Picture1" width="602" height="244" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-18.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-18-300x122.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-18-50x20.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<h2>$KENNY Rides the Hype Train &amp; Garners Influencer Approval</h2>
<p>Ethereum-based token $KENNY has already turned heads in the “shitcoin” space, thanks to its blend of humor and exciting tokenomics.</p>
<p>The token is gaining significant traction, with early investors able to snap up 40% of the total $KENNY supply while the presale is ongoing.</p>
<p>Priced at $0.0001875, this accessible entry point ensures even small-time investors can get involved.</p>
<p>Moreover, $KENNY’s low price has already led to speculation that the token could provide exponential gains once listed on public exchanges.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-26.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-261769" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-26.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="349" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-26.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-26-300x174.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-26-50x29.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>YouTube analyst Jacob Bury released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xHcMiFGPqg&amp;ab_channel=JacobCryptoBury" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">video</a> discussing his optimism around $KENNY, even going so far as to brand it a “new 10x potential meme coin”.</p>
<p>The Crypto Whale Pumps <a href="https://t.me/whalepumpgroup23/152" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Telegram channel</a>, with over 23,000 members, highlighted $KENNY as a &#8220;potential moonshot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given these mentions, it’s clear that the Burn Kenny presale has quickly captured the attention of influencers and crypto communities.</p>
<p>With the hype building rapidly, some seem to believe getting behind this micro-cap gem could provide the chance for considerable profits if $KENNY sees a trajectory similar to past meme coin presale launches.</p>
<h2>Burn Kenny Tokenomics Set Stage for Colossal Growth</h2>
<p><a href="https://bs_fa368e66.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=new-meme-coin-burn-kenny-token-presale-raises-370000-in-just-15-hours-how-to-participate" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Burn Kenny’s</a> innovative burn mechanism is a crucial factor that could further amplify the token’s value over time.</p>
<p>Just 24 hours after $KENNY’s DEX listing, the burn phase will commence, during which tokens are “burned” and permanently removed from circulation at a rate of 10% per day.</p>
<p>Per the Burn Kenny <a href="https://burnkenny.vip/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">whitepaper</a>, this will continue until 30% of the total $KENNY supply has been destroyed.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-25.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-261770" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-25.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="228" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-25.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-25-300x114.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-25-50x19.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>The deflationary model is strategic &#8211; as the token supply decreases, the remaining tokens may become more valuable due to supply and demand dynamics.</p>
<p>As such, the artificial scarcity brought about by this Burn Mechanism could help boost $KENNY’s price over time.</p>
<p>Deflationary setups like this have proved successful in the past, with Bitcoin ($BTC) and Shiba Inu ($SHIB) being two prominent examples.</p>
<p>If $KENNY can leverage its burn mechanism to achieve even a fraction of the success achieved by these crypto giants, huge profits could be in store for early adopters.</p>
<h2>Burn Kenny Aims to Emulate Success of Predecessor $HANKEY</h2>
<p>Burn Kenny&#8217;s promise is also based on the success of its predecessor, <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0x677d46d3abca5e2d3a2286c52809b51457dd2368" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mr Hankey Coin ($HANKEY)</a>.</p>
<p>The South Park-themed $HANKEY gained huge meme coin community support, leading its presale to sell out in 10 hours.</p>
<p>After this, $HANKEY debuted on Uniswap, where the token&#8217;s value rocketed by 3x.</p>
<p>This resounding success hints at the potential of South Park-themed coins that Burn Kenny can tap into.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-19.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-261771" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-19.jpg" alt="Picture4" width="602" height="231" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-19.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-19-300x115.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-19-50x19.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Furthermore, $KENNY’s liquidity setup has been designed to ensure stability and growth.</p>
<p>A generous 40% of the total $KENNY supply has been allocated to the DEX liquidity pool.</p>
<p>This substantial pool will help traders buy and sell tokens with minimal slippage.</p>
<p>Moreover, Burn Kenny’s team has also instituted a 3-month liquidity lock once the token makes its DEX debut – designed to deter large sell-offs from occurring.</p>
<p>With these measures in place and presale prices of just $0.0001875 per token, early community members believe now is the ideal time to get behind Burn Kenny before its price takes off.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[SBF and Wang allegedly misused $546 million of clients' funds to buy Robinhood shares, while Ellison awarded herself with a $29 million bonus. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">FTX Trading has reportedly filed a lawsuit against the former CEO of the exchange Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), and some people from his inner cycle to recoup more than $1 billion, which they supposedly misappropriated before the company&#8217;s demise. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Numerous regulators and fallen investors have accused the previous management team of the marketplace of orchestrating a gigantic crypto scam that eventually resulted in multi-billion losses. FTX Trading agreed with the assumption, maintaining that it was &#8220;one of the largest financial frauds in history.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Firing More Shots at SBF </span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The legal issues for the disgraced founder of FTX &#8211; Bankman-Fried &#8211; are piling up, with the latest accusation coming from the new team behind FTX Trading. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In a recent complaint filed in Delaware bankrupt court (seen by The Economic Times), he was </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/ftx-sues-sam-bankman-fried-others-to-recoup-more-than-1-billion/articleshow/101999855.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">accused</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> of swindling over $1 billion in customer funds between February 2020 and November 2022 (the time when the exchange filed for bankruptcy protection).</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">FTX Trading further claimed that Caroline Ellison (who was the leader of Alameda Research), Zixiao &#8220;Gary&#8221; Wang (former FTX technology executive), and Nishad Singh (ex-engineering director) also had a hand in the matter.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to the complaint, SBF and his inner cycle used the money to finance political campaigns, purchase luxury apartments, engage in speculative investments, and fund other &#8220;pet projects.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">FTX Trading claimed that the fraudulent transfers included over $725 million of equity that the once-leading crypto platform and West Realm Shires awarded &#8220;without receiving any value in exchange.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">SBF and Wang allegedly misappropriated $546 million to purchase Robinhood shares, whereas Ellison used almost $29 million to pay herself bonuses. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">John Ray Thinks FTX Misused Clients&#8217; Funds Since Day One</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The current CEO and Chief Restructuring Officer of FTX &#8211; John J. Ray III &#8211; has been quite a critic of the previous management crew of the exchange. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/ftx-misused-customer-funds-since-the-beginning-new-ceo-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">claimed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> last month that the company commingled customer deposits from the get-go in 2019 while former employees lied to banking institutions about using Alameda Research as a trading firm for transactions. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;The image that the FTX Group sought to portray as the customer-focused leader of the digital age was a mirage. From the inception of the FTX.com exchange, the FTX Group commingled customer deposits and corporate funds and misused them with abandon at the direction and by the design of previous senior executives,&#8221; Ray argued.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The American also maintained that the former crypto giant owed users $8.7 billion in November 2022. He concluded that the current management team has shrunk that debt, recovering $7 billion in liquid assets so far.</span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Bitcoin seems unable to break away from $30K but that may be about to change soon. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The cryptocurrency market failed to initiate anything of substance throughout the past 24 hours, with bears somewhat assuming control over the momentum. The total market capitalization dropped by around $12 billion during the period, where most major cryptocurrencies are trading in the red today.</p>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price is flirting with $30K, but this might be about to change soon, according to some analysts. Let&#8217;s dive in.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price Ping Pongs at $30K</h2>
<p>The BTC price seems unable to break out from the relatively narrow range that it&#8217;s currently trading within. The price has once again fallen below the pivotal level of $30K as it failed to sustain yesterday&#8217;s gains, as seen in the chart below.</p>

<p>Prominent analyst Willy Woo has recently <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/huge-move-incoming-for-bitcoin-consolidation-period-nears-completion-according-to-analyst/" data-wpel-link="internal">observed</a> that the price might soon be about to break out of its consolidation, with many indicators leaning bullish. If that&#8217;s the case, we can finally see BTC move away from the current range.</p>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s dominance remains more or less where it was yesterday &#8211; at around 46.5%, according to CoinGecko. This shows that altcoins were unable to make a difference as well.</p>
<h2>Synthetix Network (SNX) Pumps 10% Daily</h2>
<p>Most of the larger altcoins are trading in the red today, as demonstrated in the heatmap below. Most notably, Ripple&#8217;s XRP has been unable to sustain above $0.8 and has tumbled to $0.77, down 5.5% on the day.</p>
<figure id="attachment_261759" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-261759" style="width: 1664px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crypto_heatmap_2107231.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-261759 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crypto_heatmap_2107231.jpg" alt="crypto_heatmap_2107231" width="1664" height="1132" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crypto_heatmap_2107231.jpg 1664w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crypto_heatmap_2107231-300x204.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crypto_heatmap_2107231-1024x697.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crypto_heatmap_2107231-768x522.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crypto_heatmap_2107231-1536x1045.jpg 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crypto_heatmap_2107231-50x34.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1664px) 100vw, 1664px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-261759" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Quantify Crypto</figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, SOL is down even more, trading at negative 7% in the past 24 hours, down to $25.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency that gained the most over the same period out of the top 100 is Synthetix Network (SNX). It&#8217;s up 10.3% and a total of 30% for the past seven days. Following it at a close second place is Maker&#8217;s MKR, which gained 9% during the last day.</p>
<p>Rocket Pool (RPL), on the other hand, lost 7.6% in the past 24 hours and is down over 20% during the week.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Bitcoin market momentum has been sideways for months but on-chain metrics suggest that the consolidation could be coming to an end soon.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On July 21, prominent on-chain analyst Willy Woo said that there were early signs that Bitcoin consolidation is nearing completion.</p>
<p>The asset has been very tightly range-bound for the past month. The longer-term view stretching back four months also shows sideways trading between larger boundaries.</p>
<p>Futures demand is currently moving the market, said Woo before adding that “this demand has been climbing against sideways price action (this is bullish).”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>— Willy Woo (@woonomic) <a href="https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1682094491719847937?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">July 20, 2023</a></p></blockquote>

<h2>Bitcoin Breakout Imminent?</h2>
<p>The Bitcoin fundamental strength indicator has just turned upwards, and this is usually followed by a large move to the upside. “Volatility dynamics also signaling a larger move is probable,” said Woo.</p>
<p>Glassnode has posted data on the Bitcoin Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), which “resides within a profit-dominant regime.”</p>
<p>The current chart shows very similar patterns to the prolonged periods of sideways trading during the bear markets in 2016 and 2019. Both were followed by a large breakout to the upside as markets moved into bull territory.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">SOPR currently resides within a profit dominant regime, recording a value of 1.06, indicating the average coin changing hands is locking in a 6% profit. This has similar characteristic to both the 2016 and 2019 periods. <a href="https://t.co/XxKalGLUq4" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/XxKalGLUq4</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>However, it is still too early to call a trend change just yet as BTC has failed to break resistance above $30K on three separate occasions in the past three months. Prices consolidating at resistance usually leads to declines back to support zones.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the asset has fallen back below $30K during the Friday morning Asian trading session. At the time of writing, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-price-analysis/" data-wpel-link="internal">BTC</a> was trading down marginally at $29,875, having lost 5% since the same time last week.</p>
<h2>Elsewhere on Crypto Markets</h2>
<p>Total market capitalization is flat on the day at $1.24 trillion at the time of writing. Markets have ranged between $1 trillion and $1.3 trillion since March, as even the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/stuttering-sec-chair-gary-gensler-disappointed-at-ripple-victory/" data-wpel-link="internal">Ripple victory</a> could not get them out of this channel.</p>
<p>However, on-chain activity suggests that slow and steady accumulation is still occurring at these levels, and patient investors are still stacking sats.</p>
<p>Ethereum prices have also broken down below the $1,900 level and were at $1,894 at the time of writing. ETH encountered heavy resistance at $2,000 and is down 5.7% over the past week.</p>
<p>Most of the altcoins were in the red during Friday’s early session, with Ripple (<a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-price-analysis/" data-wpel-link="internal">XRP</a>), Cardano (ADA), and Solana (SOL) losing 3-5%.</p>
<p>Polkadot (DOT), Uniswap (UNI), and Chainlink (LINK) were posting solid gains on the day.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[Press Release &#8211; Singapore, Singapore, July 20th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p>OpenEx Closed Funding Round to build an industry-unique hybrid exchange model that integrates centralization and decentralization, aiming to be the Hybrid,CEX+DEX, where certified partners can act as their own liquidity provider.</p>
<p>OpenEx today announced it has its Pre-A close for a valuation of 50 Million USD. The round includes prominent names in the Web3 space, including <a href="https://www.csquared.vc/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">C²</a> Ventures, Agallochum Capital, TKX Capital, Future Moneys, String Capital, and many other Web3 industry leaders. The new funding will be used to better the trading experience on the products.</p>
<p>The downfall of FTX reveals the chronic illness of the industry: many crypto exchanges enter the market to trade and form opposite trades with users leading to the exchange being exposed to huge price risks, rampant insider trading, and imperfect risk controls leading to user security issues such as capital safety.</p>
<p>By allowing certified partners to own their decentralized trading pool, autonomy and membership sovereignty is at the forefront. OpenEx’s core principles are neutrality, fairness, and impartiality. With decentralized trading pools, OpenEx will ensure fairness and foster increased participation in the trading ecosystem.</p>
<p>“OpenEx is growing at an exponential rate and we look forward to pushing out more fun and innovative products to our supporters,” said Bob Chien, Chief Business Officer of OpenEx, “Given the current market situation, we will soon initiate our trade mining program, where users will be rewarded as they trade.”</p>
<p>“Based on the OpenEx infrastructure and ecosystem, important links and participants of traditional financial markets, like brokers, will be able to provide more customized services to users in different regions and with different experience profiles.” stated Chris Lee from TKX Capital.</p>
<p>When asked about the future of OpenEx, CEO Jake Stolarski, replies, “We are here to democratize the traditional CEX model, with a focus on user empowerment and freedom, we hope that we can build a beginner-friendly platform that ensures fair transactions and personalized services.”</p>
<p>OpenEx has been online for nearly 3 months and already has an active community of over 100,000 monthly active users, with 60,000+ registered users and members respectively. The daily trading volume is approximately around 100 million USD.</p>
<p><strong>About OpenEx</strong></p>
<p>OpenEx is building an industry-unique new-generation hybrid exchange model that integrates centralization and decentralization, attracting diverse market entities through diverse trading modules to maximize liquidity creation and the most efficient pricing.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The leading cryptocurrency exchange Bitget revealed its plans to expand into the Middle East region, specifically the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The financial heart of the UAE &#8211; Dubai &#8211; has turned into a hotbed of cryptocurrency activity, attracting numerous companies with its friendly approach to the industry. Binance, Bybit, OKX, and other exchanges have recently obtained approval to offer services in the area. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A Move Focused on &#8216;Core Values&#8217;</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to a recent </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/bitget-targets-middle-east-as-next-region-for-business-expansion-301881737.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">announcement</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, Bitget is preparing to expand its presence in the Middle East by establishing regional headquarters and recruiting more team members in the next two years. The new employees will be responsible for certain mid-office and back-office duties.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;We hope to scale our Middle East team rapidly to support business growth, with between 30 to 60 hires over the next two years or more across the Middle East region. New team members will include various mid-office and back-office functions.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitget revealed that it might pick Dubai as an operational hub for the Middle East market. Managing Director Gracy Chen said this move &#8220;is not just about business, it is about our core values, which rest on advancing blockchain and crypto adoption worldwide.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The exchange has already started exploring ways to secure the necessary licenses from domestic regulators. The step is considered a top priority since it will support expansion and enable the firm to open regional offices.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitget has previously </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/crypto-exchange-bitget-expands-to-africa-plans-to-hire-400-new-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">displayed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> its intentions to increase its workforce by 50% (going from 800 workers to 1200) in Africa.

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite the market&#8217;s decline last year and the numerous negative events in the crypto sector, the exchange inked some major partnerships. </span></p>

The athlete serves as a brand ambassador of the exchange, and some of his duties include introducing Bitget&#8217;s products and services to sports fans and organizations.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Interestingly, the exchange emerged as one of the winners following the gigantic collapse of FTX.

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX announced that it had extended its collaboration with one of the most successful Italian soccer teams &#8211; AC Milan. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This could be considered another proof that the company continues its recovery following the prolonger bear market last year when it laid off employees and saw its CEO resigning from his post.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Renewing the Partnership</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">BitMEX <a href="https://blog.bitmex.com/ac-milan-partnership-update/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">disclosed</a> that it has transitioned to a Premium Partner of AC Milan according to the new terms. The exchange initially inked a Sleeve Sponsorship with the sports club in 2021. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company reminded about the numerous mutual initiatives launched with AC Milan over the past few years, such as celebrating its 19th Serie A title in 2022 and backing Fondazione Milan (a project aiming to support youngsters and local communities).</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;In the years ahead, we&#8217;ll be committed to organizing similar events and offering exclusive benefits to our fans worldwide,&#8221; BitMEX assured.</span></p></blockquote>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Casper Stylsvig &#8211; Chief Revenue Officer of AC Milan &#8211; said the team is &#8220;happy&#8221; to continue its &#8220;journey alongside a partner such as BitMEX.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Stephan Lutz &#8211; CEO of the crypto platform &#8211; said the associates &#8220;appreciate and applaud the spirit of competition and the sense of connection that comes from it.&#8221; As such, the company is &#8220;thrilled&#8221; to have extended its deal with the club.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">AC Milan is the second most-successful Italian soccer team (in terms of winning domestic championships). However, it has performed much better on the European scene, lifting the Champions League trophy seven times &#8211; a record for an Italian club.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Crypto and Soccer </span></h2>

			            <description><![CDATA[The US government is slowly but surely ridding itself of its BTC connected to Silk Road. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On-chain analysts at CryptoQuant have confirmed previous rumors that the United States government has sold another large batch of Bitcoin (BTC) connected to the defunct darknet marketplace, Silk Road. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">In a report shared with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">CryptoPotato</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, the firm said that the firm sold 8,200 BTC from Silk Road hacker James Zhong on July 12.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">This was slightly under </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/dump-incoming-us-government-moves-another-9000-btc-from-silk-road/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">previous estimates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, indicating that the government had moved roughly 9,826 from its known wallets. It’s also less than the government’s first confirmed sale of 9,861 BTC for $216 million in March. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Most of the coins were moved in a single transaction of 9,319 BTC, which sent 8200 BTC to one address, and 1119 BTC to another. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The former address “ forwarded the 8,200 Bitcoin to different addresses, [and] each address received 79 Bitcoin,” wrote CryptoQuant. “These coins were eventually deposited into exchanges or recombined into fewer wallets.”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Though not confirmed, the other address with 1119 BTC is believed to be controlled by the government. “This address is highly likely the change address of the transaction,” it said. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The firm said that the government still holds 195,307 BTC. These are related to seizures from other criminal incidents, including the </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitfinex-returns-portion-of-assets-stolen-from-2016-hack/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">Bitfinex hack</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.<br />

			            <description><![CDATA[A number of market signals show rising interest in altcoins over the past week thanks to a judge’s favorable ruling on XRP’s legal status.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The landmark victory for Ripple in its lawsuit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may have ignited a bull market for neighboring altcoins, according to a recent report from CryptoQuant.</p>
<p>The crypto market intelligence firm provided a series of stats reflecting growth in altcoin market activity over the past week, versus relative stagnancy within the Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) markets.</p>
<h2>The Return of Alt Season</h2>
<p>When analyzing price performance based on market capitalization, CryptoQuant&#8217;s data shows that MidCaps, which include XRP, outperformed other groups of cryptocurrencies, soaring by 29% on June 13th.</p>
<p>This included other cryptocurrencies that had previously been categorized as securities by the SEC in its lawsuit against Coinbase last month. The movements in the market caps of such coins – including Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), and others – are plotted against those of BTC and ETH in the chart below.</p>
<figure id="attachment_261698" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-261698" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-20-134724.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-261698 size-large" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-20-134724-1024x542.png" alt="" width="1024" height="542" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-20-134724-1024x542.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-20-134724-300x159.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-20-134724-768x406.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-20-134724-50x26.png 50w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-20-134724.png 1053w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-261698" class="wp-caption-text">Crypto SECurities Index.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Received on July 13, the summary judgment in the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/following-landmark-ripple-xrp-court-ruling-congressmen-slam-gensler-and-sec-for-predatory-approach/" data-wpel-link="internal">Ripple V. SEC</a> lawsuit ruled that XRP itself is not a security, nor are sales of the token on secondary markets securities transactions.</p>
<p>This marks the first time a cryptocurrency company has successfully fought off the SEC&#8217;s claims in a legal case that all crypto assets <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sec-chair-reasserts-every-crypto-is-a-security-aside-from-bitcoin-lawyers-disagree/" data-wpel-link="internal">aside from Bitcoin</a> are securities.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Unaffected</h2>
<p>Though Bitcoin briefly rallied to $31,700 after the landmark ruling, its price has since retraced to ~$30,000 and remains rangebound.</p>
<p>Failing to maintain an elevated price level, the top asset’s market dominance has partially fallen, putting it back under 50%, according to TradingView.</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s open interest also remained unaffected, despite ETH open interest rising substantially from $2.2 million to $2.7 million since that time. In terms of funding rates, XRP doesn’t appear to have substantially affected market sentiment.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We can witness mixed sentiments among derivatives traders as Bitcoin funding is relatively high while Ethereum’s funding rates just turned negative,” wrote CryptoQuant.</p></blockquote>
<p>Finally, analysts found that short-term sentiment among traders remains negative when observing Bitcoin and Ethereum’s Taker Buy Sell Ratio – a measure of buy and sell pressure for each asset. Both cryptos ratios are current &lt;1, meaning taker buy volumes are greater than taker sell volumes, reflecting bearish attitudes.</p>
