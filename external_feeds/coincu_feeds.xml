<p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who launched his presidential campaign during a Twitter Spaces event with Elon Musk on Wednesday night, said he would defend Bitcoin if elected next year.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;I just do not have an itch to have to control everything that people may be doing in this space, and I think the current regime, clearly, they have it out for bitcoin, and if it continues for another four years, they&#8217;ll probably end up killing it,&#8221;</p>
<cite>DeSantis said.</cite></blockquote>



<p>He said that if elected, he would defend Bitcoin and oppose any form of ban on the cryptocurrency. In addition, DeSantis, who moved to <a href="https://news.coincu.com/175228-florida-governor-central-digital-currency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ban</a> any central bank digital currency in the state earlier this month, said bitcoin is a threat to &#8220;central planners&#8221; who want social control&#8221;.</p>



<p>In May 2021, DeSantis signed legislation defining cryptocurrency in state statutes. He also clarified that Florida citizens can trade crypto without a license. In March 2022, he supported allowing businesses to pay their tax bills with crypto.</p>



<p>DeSantis is being evaluated as a serious opponent of Donald Trump for the Republican nomination for the White House in 2024. NBC&#8217;s preliminary poll shows DeSantis has 31% Republican support, compared with 46% for Trump.</p>

<p>His opposition to CBDCs resonates with much of the crypto community, especially when crypto exchanges like Coinbase are battling with US authorities, accompanied by warnings that domestic regulation could push the industry abroad. According to Cathie Wood&#8217;s Ark Invest, the United States risks losing its leadership position in the global cryptocurrency ecosystem to countries like the United Arab Emirates (UAE), South Korea, Australia, and Switzerland.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Coinbase&#8217;s Base detailed a timeline for the mainnet&#8217;s launch.</em></li>



<li><em>The plan does not include any precise dates, but it does include a list of five criteria that must be met before the network may go live.</em></li>



<li><em>Base will undergo internal and external audits after the Bedrock update to ensure there are no serious concerns discovered.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Coinbase has established particular goals that must be accomplished before the firm considers deploying Base, its layer-2 solution. One critical need is that the testnet has an established track record of stability.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1277.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="512" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1277-1024x512.png" alt="Coinbase&#039;s Layer-2 Coming To Mainnet Soon, No Tokens Planned" class="wp-image-189649" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1277-1024x512.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1277-300x150.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1277-768x384.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1277-360x180.png 360w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1277-750x375.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1277.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Coinbase&#039;s Layer-2 Coming To Mainnet Soon, No Tokens Planned 6"></a></figure></div>


<p>For the time being, the firm is incubating its Base internally, but the platform will ultimately become totally decentralized. It is based on Optimism&#8217;s OP development stack, which means that reaching the mainnet stage is heavily dependent on the efforts and contributions of OP Labs, an Optimism protocol contributor.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://base.mirror.xyz/gxOzGCE-9C7cNZBCo4Ubkkxr87L8BcHDfn5HViSdYGg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a>, the network&#8217;s primary concern as it prepares to launch its mainnet is safety and security. Mainnet migration milestones include testnet stability, the successful update of Optimism&#8217;s Bedrock, and the completion of evaluations and audits.</p>



<p>Completing the Regolith hardfork on the testnet network and testing the infrastructure with Optimism&#8217;s team before the Bedrock upgrade are examples of accomplished milestones.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1278.png"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="667" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1278.png" alt="Coinbase&#039;s Layer-2 Coming To Mainnet Soon, No Tokens Planned" class="wp-image-189650" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1278.png 1000w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1278-300x200.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1278-768x512.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1278-750x500.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" title="Coinbase&#039;s Layer-2 Coming To Mainnet Soon, No Tokens Planned 7"></a></figure></div>


<p>The first phase of the Layer-2 on the mainnet will be &#8220;Mainnet Genesis,&#8221; following which developers will have a window to deploy applications on Layer 2 on the mainnet. The Base core team will support decentralized apps that will be acknowledged as early builders on the network at this stage.</p>



<p>While the blog did not provide a timeframe or precise dates for when the network will be available on the main network, it did describe five particular criteria that would be unlocked during the event. The successful testnet of the Regolith hard fork and an infrastructure evaluation with the OP Labs team have already satisfied two of these requirements.</p>



<p>The objective continues to expand global economic freedom and opportunity by bringing millions of developers and the next billions of users into the crypto economy. Contrary to popular belief in the crypto world, Base indicated in the statement that it has no intentions to develop its own Layer 2 token.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Bitcoin continues to fall and break out of the $26,000 mark amid worries about the US debt ceiling and heightened Sino-US tensions.</em></li>



<li><em>Bitcoin&#8217;s price movement over the past 30 days has been at its lowest level since the beginning of this year.</em></li>



<li><em>The correlation between this market&#8217;s most significant currency and US stocks has decreased markedly.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><a href="https://news.coincu.com/189589-energy-web-launches-gp4btc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> has fallen off the $26,000 mark after a long period of trading around the $27,000-$26,500 mark, causing its correlation with US stocks to have dropped markedly.</strong></h5>



<p>Before that, the largest cryptocurrency in the world was trading around the threshold of 27,000 USD/BTC for three consecutive weeks. Price volatility is relatively low. Average trading volume over the past 7 days has hit the lowest level in 2 and a half years.</p>

<p>Today, BTC, after closing a strong bearish candle on the daily frame, confirmed that the momentum of the bulls is overwhelmed, but on the larger time frame, BTC price has reached weekly support.</p>



<p>In addition to the smaller timeframes, the momentum indicators are already in the oversold area. This does not rule out the possibility that BTC will retest the $25,000 support area and continue to withdraw and retest the resistance areas over $27,000 and $28,000.</p>

<p>Asian shares fell on Wednesday as investors traded cautiously after Sino-US tensions increased following China&#8217;s trade war. The ban on products by US memory chip maker Micron Technology manufactured for security concerns. Traders are also concerned that negotiations to raise the US debt ceiling have not progressed.</p>



<p>Major US stock futures fell. Tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures fell 0.17%, S&amp;P 500 futures fell 0.19%, and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 0.20%.</p>



<p>Sluggish debt ceiling negotiations have also weighed on investor sentiment, with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy saying on Tuesday that the two sides have yet to reach an agreement to avert a government default on the June 1st debt ceiling of 31.4 trillion US dollars.</p>



<p>The correlation between Bitcoin and US stocks can be seen decreasing, and this has been a popular trend since the beginning of this year. However, according to Bitcoin advocates, the cryptocurrency is a safe-haven asset during market volatility.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Tenet will collaborate with Conflux and Qtum, two blockchains with a strong presence in China, to strengthen the liquid staking industry&#8217;s foothold in the country&#8217;s marketplaces.</em></li>



<li><em>Users of Conflux and Qtum will each commit a minimum of $1 million in their native tokens to help protect each blockchain.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tenet, a layer-1 for generating yield and usefulness for fluid staking derivatives (FSD), is broadening its reach on the Cmarket by forming two vital collaborations with QTUM, a network based on Proof of Stake that amalgamates Ethereum and Bitcoin&#8217;s benefits, and Conflux, a foundational network operating on Tree-Graph, which is a hybrid consensus mechanism based on Proof of Stake and Proof of Work.</strong></h5>

<p>Users of Conflux and Qtum will each commit a minimum of $1 million in their native tokens to help secure each blockchain and earn Rewards from Web3 infrastructure company Ankr. Conflux and Qtum investors will then transfer their LSDs to Tenet&#8217;s network and resell them to get access to higher yield and utility.</p>

<p>Tenet provides a one-of-a-kind layer-1 ecosystem, with security derived in part from all partner tokens stored on its platform. Stakers get complete access to multiple DeFi yield chances on the network in exchange for each LSD staked through a Tenet LSD.</p>



<p>Customers that connect their assets to the network will be granted a one-of-a-kind LSD token by Ankr, a top staking infrastructure provider and Tenet partner. The LSD tokens are then staked with the layer-1 in order to produce TLSDs. By combining the original network yield, Tenet staking yield, and the DeFi protocol yield, stakers may treble their sources of income.</p>

<p>Conflux, which bills itself as China&#8217;s sole regulatory-compliant blockchain, has partnered with worldwide businesses and government institutions such as the city of Shanghai, McDonald&#8217;s China, and China Telecom. Qtum is a proof-of-stake blockchain that previously collaborated with Amazon Web Services China in 2018.</p>



<p>Tenet has also collaborated with Ankr, a supplier of staking infrastructure, to assist in developing LSD projects for its layer-1 blockchain partners. Greg Gopman, formerly CMO at Ankr, and Dan Peterson, formerly Director of Sales Operations at Blockdaemon, are co-founders of the initiative.</p>

<p>Companies may use the automated blockchain builder to have access to a no-code blockchain portal with 24/7 technical support and specialized infrastructure staff to assist them in running a bespoke network. AvaCloud blockchains employ precompiled smart contracts that are customizable and incorporated into blockchain technology.</p>



<p>Businesses may reduce time-to-market and expense by deploying fully supported networks without the need to recruit a large technical crew.</p>



<p>AvaCloud is already serving a wide range of applications, from large corporations to tiny teams of Web3 developers. Managed validators facilitate installation and upgrades, whilst extensive data tools give blockchain insights from the whole Avalanche network and Ethereum blockchain.</p>



<p>Ava Labs has just released Avalanche Warp Messaging, which enables native communications across all Avalanche subnets.</p>

<p>According to Ava Labs, the new tool will increase income prospects and pave the way for mass adoption-ready cloud-based blockchain infrastructure. Among its early adopters are AAA gaming company Shrapnel and Korean giant SK.</p>



<p>Ava Labs has been expanding its product offerings to cater to both Web2 and Web3 audiences, welcoming financial institutions like Deloitte, T. Rowe Price, and WisdomTree into its ecosystem. In May, the cloud division of Chinese tech behemoth Alibaba built a launchpad for businesses to deploy metaverse spaces on the Avalanche blockchain.</p>



<p>As Coincu <a href="https://news.coincu.com/187731-avalanche-powering-smart-contracts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, on the Avalanche Fuji testnet, Chainlink Functions, a serverless developer platform that lets anybody connect any Web2 API to a smart contract, is live.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>GP4BTC, a first-of-its-kind attempt to build an impartial, standardized energy monitoring system for the Bitcoin mining business, was launched by Energy Web.</em></li>



<li><em>It will function as a certification layer, allowing miners to communicate vital information with other entities.</em></li>



<li><em>The initiative will also assist firms mining responsibly in terms of recognition and reputation.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to a <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/05/24/2675064/0/en/Energy-Web-Launches-Certification-for-Sustainable-Bitcoin-Mining.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">news release</a>, the non-profit group Energy Web is launching a free sustainability register for Bitcoin miners that takes into consideration their energy inputs and influence on power networks.</strong></h5>

<p>Green Proofs for Bitcoin (GP4BTC) would act as a certification layer, allowing miners to communicate crucial data with other organizations.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>According to Amy Westervelt, Senior Delivery Lead and Head of the GP4BTC effort at Energy Web, the register may be referred to by different organizations depending on the performance of the miners. The goal of the initiative is to increase openness and accountability in the Bitcoin (BTC) mining business.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Today Bitcoin is scrutinized for its electricity consumption and associated climate impact. While leading miners are pursuing strategies to reduce their carbon footprints, the industry lacks a unifying definition of sustainable mining, as well as a shared framework for assessing and verifying miners’ sustainability practices. Green Proofs for Bitcoin seeks to provide this,” he stated.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Miners&#8217; environmental effect has been increasingly questioned because of their excessive energy usage. The Biden administration has said that it is considering imposing a punitive tax on miners depending on their energy use. At the time of the debut, Argo Blockchain, Cowa, DMG Blockchain, Gryphon Digital Mining, and Hive Blockchain were all approved.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>GP4BTC provides transparency into Bitcoin miners&#8217; decarbonization efforts, assisting the industry on its way to net-zero emissions. The project certifies miners based on their use of sustainable energy and contributions to grid stability during demand response. It encourages sustainability and responsibility in the Bitcoin mining industry.</p>



<p>GP4BTC will grade bitcoin miners based on two measures that include the energy mix they use: their purchases of renewable energy credits (RECs) and involvement in demand response programs. RECs reflect ownership in the long-term viability of the power generated. Demand response solutions enable businesses to shut down during peak energy demand.</p>



<p>Registration is now available for free. According to Westervelt, Energy Web is contemplating instituting fees for miners seeking certification or consumers wishing to access the data.</p>

<p>The previous verdict was reversed by the high court in Montenegro&#8217;s capital Podgorica, court spokesperson Marija Rakovic said by phone on Wednesday. Kwon is still imprisoned.</p>



<p>Do Kwon, a South Korean person, is the former CEO of Terraform Labs, the South Korean company behind the stablecoin TerraUSD, which crashed in May 2022, unsettling cryptocurrency markets.</p>



<p>Han Chong-joon, Kwon&#8217;s former chief financial officer, is also affected by the judgment. Both were granted bail of 400,000 euros ($430,500) by the Basic Court in Podgorica earlier this month. The prosecution swiftly filed an appeal, which moved the matter to a higher court for a decision.</p>



<p>Kwon and Joon were apprehended in March when they attempted to board a flight to Dubai at the airport in Montenegro&#8217;s capital, Podgorica. The two were accused of falsifying official papers, and a court in Podgorica sentenced them to 30 days in pre-trial custody.</p>



<p>The prosecution contended that once freed from jail, the defendants would have no desire to remain in Montenegro while awaiting extradition.</p>



<p>After Do Kwon&#8217;s arrest, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York unsealed an eight-count indictment against him for securities fraud, wire fraud, commodities fraud, and conspiracy.</p>



<p>The defendants, who previously denied any wrongdoing in relation to the accusations brought by the Montenegro prosecutor, informed the court that they owned property worth millions of euros and that the bail would be secured by their spouses.</p>



<p>Montenegro is not the only country threatening to execute Kwon, Han, and other Terraform Labs executives. They are also being <a href="https://news.coincu.com/189311-do-kwons-freedom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">investigated</a> by courts in South Korea, Singapore, and the United States. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accused Kwon and others of willfully trading in unregistered securities. If extradited to South Korea, Terraform Labs&#8217; founder may face up to 40 years in jail.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The Japanese Cabinet resolved on Tuesday to implement tighter anti-money laundering measures beginning June 1.</em></li>



<li><em>The proposal will allow digital asset transfers to be tracked, putting the country&#8217;s legal system in line with global norms.</em></li>



<li><em>Stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies tied to a currency such as the US dollar or a commodity, are among the crypto assets sought.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to local news site <em><a href="https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2023/05/c6410ba692f5-japan-to-enforce-crypto-anti-money-laundering-steps-from-june.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kyodo News</a></em>, Japan is due to introduce tighter anti-money laundering measures, including the Financial Action Task Force&#8217;s (FATF) so-called &#8220;travel rule,&#8221; on June 1.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1256.png"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="667" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1256.png" alt="Japan Effectively Prevents Crypto Anti-Money Laundering In June: Report" class="wp-image-189583" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1256.png 1000w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1256-300x200.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1256-768x512.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1256-750x500.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" title="Japan Effectively Prevents Crypto Anti-Money Laundering In June: Report 29"></a></figure></div>


<p>The decision was announced by Japan&#8217;s cabinet on Tuesday, after the global financial crime watchdog FATF found the country&#8217;s anti-money laundering measures inadequate.</p>



<p>According to the research, oversight groups have increased their surveillance of crypto assets that might be used to launder money, a practice in which money earned from unlawful acts is made to seem legitimate by processing it via legal transactions.</p>



<p>The FATF suggested the travel rule in 2019 to prevent money laundering and terrorism funding using cryptocurrency. By June 2022, the FATF was pressing member countries to pass travel rules &#8220;as quickly as feasible.&#8221;</p>



<p>The regulation mandates a financial institution conducting a crypto asset transfer to pass on customer information to the next institution, including the sender and recipient&#8217;s names and addresses.</p>



<p>Stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies tied to a currency such as the US dollar or a commodity, are among the crypto assets sought. If offenders do not comply with authorities&#8217; remedial directives, they will face criminal charges.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, the Group of Seven (G-7) international political body expressed support for the FATF&#8217;s efforts to hasten the worldwide implementation of its travel rule, which requires financial institutions to provide information about crypto money transfers. At the time, Japan had not enacted the travel rule. Japan&#8217;s decision to enforce the regulation is considered as an attempt to line with global norms backed by the G-7, of which Japan now serves as president.</p>



<p>Japan was an early embrace of cryptocurrency, legalizing it as property. Japan&#8217;s cryptocurrency restrictions are among the most severe in the world. After the massive hacks of Mt.Gox and Coincheck, Japan&#8217;s financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency, tightened regulations on cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>

<p>Customers have been reporting frozen transactions since May 21. According to Multichain, the troubles are the result of an ongoing upgrade and delayed upgrades to nodes for cross-chain routers.</p>



<p>According to a Chinese source, the Multichain crew was seized by Chinese authorities, and the Multichain team quickly transferred the token to the Gate.io exchange.</p>

<p>Axie Avatar Forge includes features that allow users to diversify their profile.</p>



<p>To begin, users may choose from a palette of 20 backdrop colors, including translucent, for their PNG or GIF. This enables matching their axie to a personal or business identity in either the digital or physical domains simpler than before. They can also zoom out to display your axie&#8217;s whole body or zoom in on its face. They now have more influence over their digital identity than ever before, thanks to Avatar Forge.</p>



<p>Users may use elements from the Axie Avatar Forge to build full animated scenarios, or they can freeze the frame of an axie in the midst of an action, such as halfway through a backflip.</p>



<p>While creating their avatar, users may additionally turn axie accessories on or off using the Axie Avatar Forge.</p>



<p>In addition, the team will commemorate the debut of the Axie Avatar Forge with a community challenge. Respond to the announcement tweet with an avatar from the Axie Avatar Maker. The best five responses in terms of overall likes will each get one Japanese axie. The competition will be open until June 7.</p>



<p>Sky Mavis has announced that Axie Infinity: Origins is now accessible on the Apple App Store, although for a limited number of countries, as Coincu previously <a href="https://news.coincu.com/188114-axie-infinity-launched-on-app-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>. Sky Games&#8217; long-term goal is to capitalize on the popularity of Axie Infinity Classic in 2021 by delivering a better gaming experience that does not need users to acquire NFTs and is available via conventional app stores.</p>



<p>Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Mexico, Venezuela, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam are among the countries involved in the launch, with a concentration on Latin America and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
