            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Department of Justice (DOJ) of the United States plans to reinforce its team responsible for investigating cryptocurrency-related crimes with more prosecutors. The unit will also have a new leader, with Claudia Quiroz replacing Eun Young Choi at the helm.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The team has played a major role in many of the DOJ&#8217;s crypto cases, such as bringing charges against Bitzlato and the investigation into Binance.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The DOJ <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-revamps-crypto-enforcement-team-73638efb?mod=lead_feature_below_a_pos1" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">disclosed</a> that it will more than double the number of prosecutors working for the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET) to prevent future crimes involving digital assets.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The unit will also become a permanent fixture of a section within the department&#8217;s criminal division focused on various computer-related probes. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Senior Justice Department official Nicole Argentieri revealed that Claudia Quiroz will serve as the NCET&#8217;s new leader, raising hopes that the amendments will bring the team &#8220;to the next level.&#8221;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Merging it into [Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section] will give it the resources and runway to accomplish even more,&#8221; she added.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The DOJ established the NCET in 2021 amid concerns that criminals, terrorists, and other wrongdoers have employed cryptocurrencies in their illicit activities.

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Interestingly, two months later, the cryptocurrency community witnessed the doom of FTX: seen by many as one of the biggest scams in the history of the industry. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ari Redbord &#8211; a former federal prosecutor who works at blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs &#8211; believes the DOJ has realized that &#8220;we&#8217;ve moved to a digital battlefield, where wars are fought on blockchains.&#8221;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;The reality is if this is, in fact, the future, every prosecutor, every investigator, is going to need to understand these cases,&#8221; he concluded.</span></p></blockquote>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, we take a closer look at Ethereum, Ripple, Cardano, Solana, and Polygon.</p>
<h2>Ethereum (ETH)</h2>
<p>Ethereum has shown indecision in the past week. This allowed sellers to take over the price action, which ended the week with a 5% loss. Despite this correction, the cryptocurrency remains above the key support at $1,820.</p>
<p>The current resistance is found at $2,000. ETH tried several times to turn this key level into support, but buyers were not strong enough, and the price fell under it every time.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, ETH seems likely to continue to range above the key support until the market forces push for a breakout. Considering that bears have the upper hand right now, do not exclude a possible test of the key support at $1,820.</p>
<figure id="attachment_261749" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-261749" style="width: 2854px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSD_2023-07-21_10-47-24.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-261749" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSD_2023-07-21_10-47-24.png" alt="ETHUSD_2023-07-21_10-47-24" width="2854" height="1458" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSD_2023-07-21_10-47-24.png 2854w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSD_2023-07-21_10-47-24-300x153.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSD_2023-07-21_10-47-24-1024x523.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSD_2023-07-21_10-47-24-768x392.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSD_2023-07-21_10-47-24-1536x785.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSD_2023-07-21_10-47-24-2048x1046.png 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSD_2023-07-21_10-47-24-50x26.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2854px) 100vw, 2854px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-261749" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Ripple (XRP)</h2>
<p>XRP has managed to maintain its most recent gains, booking a modest 3% loss as the price consolidates above the key support at $0.68. While most altcoins entered a deeper correction, XRP is holding quite well at current levels.</p>
<p>The key resistance is found at $0.93 cents, and so far, sellers did not allow the price to move above it. It is likely that the psychological level at $1 will attract a lot of sellers in the future looking to secure profits.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, XRP should be well positioned to hold above 68 cents as buyers prepare another attempt at breaking the key resistance.</p>
<figure id="attachment_261747" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-261747" style="width: 2854px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/XRPUSDT_2023-07-21_10-50-48.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-261747" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/XRPUSDT_2023-07-21_10-50-48.png" alt="XRPUSDT_2023-07-21_10-50-48" width="2854" height="1458" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/XRPUSDT_2023-07-21_10-50-48.png 2854w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/XRPUSDT_2023-07-21_10-50-48-300x153.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/XRPUSDT_2023-07-21_10-50-48-1024x523.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/XRPUSDT_2023-07-21_10-50-48-768x392.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/XRPUSDT_2023-07-21_10-50-48-1536x785.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/XRPUSDT_2023-07-21_10-50-48-2048x1046.png 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/XRPUSDT_2023-07-21_10-50-48-50x26.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2854px) 100vw, 2854px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-261747" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Cardano (ADA)</h2>
<p>In contrast to XRP, ADA has failed to retain most of its gains, and the price retraced nearly in full to the key support at 30 cents. In the process, it lost 10% of its valuation in the past week.</p>
<p>With buyers unable to push higher, they are left to defend the key support. This shows weakness in the price action, and there is little hope that ADA can make any significant moves at this time. The current resistance is at 35 cents.</p>
<p><span style="color: #2b2b2b;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead</span></span>, ADA has lost its bullish momentum. Buyers will have to wait for another opportunity until they attempt another move to reach the key targets at 35 and 38 cents.</p>
<figure id="attachment_261748" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-261748" style="width: 2854px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ADAUSDT_2023-07-21_10-49-33.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-261748" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ADAUSDT_2023-07-21_10-49-33.png" alt="ADAUSDT_2023-07-21_10-49-33" width="2854" height="1458" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ADAUSDT_2023-07-21_10-49-33.png 2854w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ADAUSDT_2023-07-21_10-49-33-300x153.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ADAUSDT_2023-07-21_10-49-33-1024x523.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ADAUSDT_2023-07-21_10-49-33-768x392.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ADAUSDT_2023-07-21_10-49-33-1536x785.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ADAUSDT_2023-07-21_10-49-33-2048x1046.png 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ADAUSDT_2023-07-21_10-49-33-50x26.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2854px) 100vw, 2854px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-261748" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">Solana (SOL)</span></p>
<p>Solana has entered a corrective period, booking a 10% loss this past week. This is not so concerning so long the price manages to hold above the key support at $25.</p>
<p>The current resistance levels are found at $28 and $33. SOL will have to break above these levels if the price is to continue its uptrend. Considering the price already doubled since June, it seems unlikely for the bulls will manage this in the short term.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, this cryptocurrency should focus on consolidating most of its recent gains and defend the key support level. This will allow it to create a strong base for a continuation of the uptrend.</p>
<figure id="attachment_261746" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-261746" style="width: 2854px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-21_10-52-27.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-261746" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-21_10-52-27.png" alt="SOLUSDT_2023-07-21_10-52-27" width="2854" height="1458" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-21_10-52-27.png 2854w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-21_10-52-27-300x153.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-21_10-52-27-1024x523.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-21_10-52-27-768x392.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-21_10-52-27-1536x785.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-21_10-52-27-2048x1046.png 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-21_10-52-27-50x26.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2854px) 100vw, 2854px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-261746" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">Polygon (MATIC) </span></p>
<p>MATIC is also found in a correction after a spike in the price took it to 90 cents. The current support is at 75 cents, and the price is slowly approaching this key level after losing 9% of its valuation this past week.</p>
<p>Such a correction is to be expected, considering that MATIC was at 50 cents in June. Any sharp increase in the price is usually followed by a pullback.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, if this cryptocurrency holds at 75 cents, then the uptrend will remain intact and allow buyers to try again to break the resistance at 90 cents. However, such price action will also depend on the overall market, which has to turn bullish to allow for this.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[Press Release &#8211; Seoul, South Korea, July 21st, 2023]</strong></p>
<p>Superblock, a contributor to <a href="https://www.over.network/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Over Protocol</a>, has raised $8 million from prominent companies and VCs in South Korea across two funding rounds. Investors included SK, Netmarble, DSC, E&amp;Investment, Schmidt, SpringCamp, and NaverZ.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ben (Jae-Yun) Kim, the founder of Superblock, said: &#8220;We are deeply diving into the South Korea market with the best local partners and looking to meet global partners accelerating us all over the world.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>As layer 1 blockchains have become faster and more established over time, the costs of bootstrapping and maintaining nodes have become increasingly expensive. As a consequence, blockchain applications have become challenging to operate without the use of costly equipment.</p>
<p>Over Protocol is a new layer 1 blockchain based on a protocol named &#8220;Ethanos&#8221; that only considers active accounts valid, enabling full nodes to discard obsolete data and operate with less storage, thus allowing for reduced storage requirements. With Over, anyone will be able to run a node and become a validator on their PCs at home. Ethanos has been published at EuroSys’21.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;With the ability for anyone to run a validator, individuals can earn potentially passive income through a process called home staking, enabling them to embrace a new lifestyle with new payment options, enhanced credit, and innovative finance opportunities,&#8221; Ben added.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>About Superblock </strong></p>
<p>Superblock builds products, tools, and decentralized applications to flourish the Over Protocol. Over Protocol is a truly decentralized layer 1 blockchain providing lightweight full nodes.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The advocacy group said that the bill would violate the First Amendment.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The bipartisan legislation introduced earlier this week &#8211; titled the Crypto-Asset National Security Enhancement (CANSEE) Act &#8211; that seeks to regulate the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector has caused quite a stir. Cypto advocacy groups are voicing objection to the bill arguing that such an approach would stifle innovation in the United States.</p>
<p>Coin Center, for one, lashed out at the bill and called it a messy, arbitrary, and unconstitutional approach to DeFi.</p>
<h2>CANSEE: A &#8216;Violation&#8217; of First Amendment</h2>
<p>The bipartisan Crypto-Asset National Security Enhancement Act (CANSEE) bill aims to tackle money laundering violations in DeFi, but legal experts remain skeptical. In a blog <a href="https://www.coincenter.org/the-cansee-act-is-a-messy-arbitrary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">post</a>, the crypto think tank&#8217;s CEO Jerry Brito slammed the bill introduced by Senators Reed, Rounds, Warner, and Romney, saying it &#8220;comes as a surprise&#8221; for lack of inputs from industry stakeholders.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8216;While we appreciate the Senators’ desire to combat the abuse of crypto protocols by criminal and enemy actors, the bill unfortunately also would make the development of such protocols in the U.S. and by U.S. persons unfeasible. Worse, the bill would be unconstitutional legislation as it would clearly violate the First Amendment.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Brito explained that if the legislation is passed, it would extend the penalties to anyone who &#8220;makes available an application designed to facilitate transactions using a digital asset protocol&#8221; as well as to those who &#8220;control a digital asset protocol,&#8221; a factor that will be solely determined by the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<p>Coin Center said that the bill gives &#8220;virtually unbounded discretion&#8221; to the Secretary.</p>
<p>Deeming it &#8220;unconstitutional,&#8221; Brito said that CANSEE could potentially impose crackdowns on developers, thereby leaving them vulnerable to &#8220;prosecution for merely publishing software&#8221; which is a violation of the First Amendment right to publish code.</p>
<h2>Decentralized in Name Only</h2>
<p>Even though the core idea behind <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/decentralized-finance-defi-vanguard-of-financial-revolution-assessing-opportunities-bottlenecks-compliance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">DeFi</a> is a &#8220;decentralized infrastructure&#8221; with no central authority, not all protocols are as decentralized as they claim. To that extent, the Coin Center admitted that it understands the Senators&#8217; approach to prosecute entities who facilitate money laundering and sanctions evasion by providing services that are &#8220;decentralized in name only.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, a blanket ban on the publication of open-source code for decentralized crypto protocols and enabling the Secretary to have sole discretion to give permits to centralized protocols that may as well be traditional financial institutions &#8220;is to cede the field of innovation to the rest of the world&#8221; the advocacy group said.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pepe’s price has shown significant weakness of late, falling 14% in seven days and 2.47% in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>The recent sell-off means the 13 July rally has been canceled out, leading to a head and shoulders pattern on the Pepe price chart.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, the price has dropped below the head and shoulders neckline and crossed below the 21-day exponential moving average.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-20.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-261828" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-20.jpg" alt="Picture4" width="624" height="265" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-20.jpg 624w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-20-300x127.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-20-50x21.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></a></p>
<p>For Pepe to regain bullish momentum, it must reclaim the head and shoulders neckline and use that as support before making a higher high.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Pepe’s inability to hold above $0.000001763 shows a weakening interest in the project and could signify a move toward $0.00000091.</p>
<p>After a sell of beginning on 4 July, Pepe’s price climbed over 13% in one day on 13 July. However, this was because of XRP’s partial victory over the SEC, and sell pressure continued the following day.</p>
<p>Pepe’s social analytics also paint a bearish picture. According to LunarCrush, <a href="https://lunarcrush.com/coins/pepe/pepe?metric=social_volume&amp;interval=1m" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Pepe’s social mentions</a> are down 76% in the last month, while social contributions are down 91%.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture5-7.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-261827" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture5-7.jpg" alt="Picture5" width="624" height="243" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture5-7.jpg 624w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture5-7-300x117.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture5-7-50x19.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></a></p>
<p>Moving to price data, CoinMarketCap shows <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Pepe’s 24-hour trading volume</a> is down 16% at $71,038,214.</p>
<p>The project currently has a $587,924,771 market cap, ranked 68 amongst all cryptocurrencies on CoinMarketCap.</p>
<p>Overall, Pepe’s price and social metrics show that interest is ceasing for the project. Could this be an end of an era, or is this a blip in Pepe’s journey? Ultimately, that remains to be seen.</p>
<p>For Pepe to regain the upwards trajectory, the broader market must display significant strength, and new developments or partnerships could also help boosts its price.</p>
<p>Ultimately, however, Pepe looks bearish in the short term, unable to hold above $0.000001763.</p>
<h2><strong>Traders Back New Token Evil Pepe Coin as a Pepe Alternative</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.care/b_evilpepe_35234?referrer=pepe-coin-price-falls-14-in-7-days-traders-are-buying-evil-pepe-coin-instead" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Evil Pepe</a> is a new Pepe alternative looking to reignite the Pepe hype. Currently available in its presale at $0.000333, the project could provide early investors access to the next meme coin pump.</p>
<p>So far, Evil Pepe has raised over $180K despite launching only a few days ago. However, top media analysts have already picked up the project, so a quick presale is expected.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture6-4.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-261826" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture6-4.jpg" alt="Picture6" width="936" height="380" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture6-4.jpg 936w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture6-4-300x122.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture6-4-768x312.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture6-4-50x20.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px" /></a></p>
<p>The project acts as Pepe’s alter ego, “the voice in your head you know will get you rich.”</p>
<p>90% of the $EVILPEPE tokens will be available in the presale, with the remaining 10% committed to DEX liquidity. This makes the project 100% community-driven and enables the seamless trading of the token.</p>
<p>Thanks to Pepe’s recent disappointing performance, the Evil Pepe community are calling for the project to absorb some of the Pepe community.</p>
<p>Analyst <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEFcrVYWdQM" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Jacob Bury</a> covered the project recently, speculating it could be “the next Pepe”. The Youtuber highlighted that coins inspired by Pepe often perform well.</p>
<p>Evil Pepe’s market cap at launch will be $1,996,002 &#8211; a drop in the ocean compared to Pepe’s $587 million market cap. This presents significant room for growth if the hype continues.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the legendary surge of Pepecoin ($PEPE), new meme coins are popping up everywhere. There are thousands of projects out there, and many analysts go about how investing in meme coins can generate tremendous profits and life-changing returns.</p>
<p>The reality, however, is that finding the right altcoin at the right price to put your hard-earned money in is particularly challenging. A newcomer, <a href="https://www.millionairegame.net/claim-discount-55" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">MillionaireGame ($MG)</a>, claimed to create a new millionaire every month. Can it really do that? Let’s dive in.</p>
<h2>What is the MillionaireGame?</h2>
<p>The MillionaireGame is a community-driven cryptocurrency project that sets the bold aim of “minting a crypto millionaire through smart contracts every month.”</p>
<p>In essence, the game works through a smart contract that’s provably fair, according to the official website, and the process of picking the winner is fully automated and auditable. The winner is chosen at random, but there’s one constant &#8211; it’s always one of the eligible $MG (the native token of the project) holders.</p>
<p>The smart contract is built on Ethereum, taking advantage of the network’s robust infrastructure, as well as a diverse user base and trustworthiness.</p>
<p>There’s also a certain appeal to the $MG and the way the entire ecosystem is being built. With the founder <a href="https://etherscan.io/verifySig/21810" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">revealed as a genuine crypto millionaire</a>, claims that MillionaireGame was “made by millionaires to create even more millionaires” adds to its convincing appeal.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-27.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-261809" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-27.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="624" height="367" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-27.jpg 624w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-27-300x176.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-27-50x29.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></a></p>
<h2>Necessary Steps and Tokenomics</h2>
<p>The team has also taken a few necessary steps to make sure that the drawing process doesn’t negatively interfere with the tokenomics of $MG. In fact, the website says that it’s estimated that during the game’s operation, the value should increase by some 2% per month while sustaining the tokenomics for a long period in the future.</p>
<p>As per the tokenomics in particular, an estimated 93% of the total supply of $MG will eventually be held by the community. The token supply is capped to 1 billion $MG.</p>
<p>It’s also interesting to note that there is no team pool, which should eliminate concerns of potential dumping on behalf of the team.</p>
<p>In general, the MillionaireGame is designed in a way where it caters to the genuine needs of investors. This is what’s supposed to set it apart from typical meme coins, most of which are just more of the same.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that this is not a lottery &#8211; each month, a token holder will have the chance to become the next crypto millionaire.</p>

<h2>$MG Presale Ongoing Now</h2>
<p>Early investors have the chance to get in before the public launch of the game &#8211; there’s currently an <a href="https://www.millionairegame.net/claim-discount-55" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ongoing presale</a>.</p>
<p>It’s designed in a modern way with numerous stages. During each stage, the price increases. This encourages early participation. Of course, those take on more risk, but this is directly reflected in the higher potential of return.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that there will be a pre-listing buy-back as well as a post-listing burn. The first round of the buy-back will take place before the listing, and it will allow those who feel more timid to exit. This will also alleviate concerns about quick selling from those who don’t believe in the project’s longer-term vision.</p>
<p>Once the $MG token is listed on exchanges, the repurchased tokens will be burned, allowing the true supporters to share in the rewards.</p>
<p>As the stages progress, the price of $MG is expected to continue increasing throughout the presale event itself.</p>
<p>To find out more about the project, please take a look at its <a href="https://www.millionairegame.org/MG-lite-paper.pdf" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Litepaper</a>.

			            <description><![CDATA[The trading volume of stablecoins rose for the first time since March. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The stablecoin market witnessed a declining market capitalization for the 16th consecutive month. According to the latest crypto analytics platform, CCData, the figure fell by 0.82% to $127 billion in July, hitting the lowest level since August 2021.</p>
<p>The market cap dominance of stablecoins also plummeted to 10.3% from 10.5% in July. On the brighter side, however, the stablecoin trading volume surged by more than 16% to $483 billion in June. This was the first increase in monthly volumes since March.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://ccdata.io/reports/stablecoins-cbdcs-report-july-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">report</a> noted the rising trading volume trend could be due to the volatility in the market triggered by the lawsuits against crypto giant Coinbase and Binance brought by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</li>
<li>The uptick in trading activity following the spot Bitcoin ETF applications filed by multiple TradFi companies, such as BlackRock and WisdomTree, could be yet another factor.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As of the 17th of July, only $219bn has been traded – with volumes on track to record a lower monthly volume with major assets including Bitcoin and Ethereum struggling to break key resistance levels at $32,000 and $2,000 respectively.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>July witnessed USDT&#8217;s dominance, which notched a fresh <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/tether-circulation-hits-new-peak-as-confidence-in-circle-continues-to-shrink/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">all-time high</a> market cap of $83.8 billion, accounting for more than 65% of all the stablecoins by market cap.</li>
<li>During the same period, USDC and BUSD&#8217;s market cap plunged significantly, falling by 3.01% and 4.57% to $26.9 billion and $3.96 billion, respectively.</li>
<li>The trend marked the seventh consecutive month of decline in Circle-backed stablecoin which had previously seen a dent in investor confidence as a result of the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/circles-usdc-outflows-surpassed-10b-since-svb-collapse-tether-dominance-rises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">banking turmoil</a>. This is also the lowest market cap for USDC since June 2021.</li>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a whirlwind presale that has sent ripples of excitement throughout the crypto market, a brand new meme coin has successfully raised a remarkable $370,000 in just 15 hours.</p>
<p><a href="https://bs_fa368e66.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=new-meme-coin-burn-kenny-token-presale-raises-370000-in-just-15-hours-how-to-participate" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Burn Kenny ($KENNY)</a>, inspired by the beloved South Park character, is now getting ready to make its DEX debut once the remaining presale tokens have been sold.</p>
<p>With the DEX launch on the horizon, investors are now speculating that $KENNY could surge when it hits the open market.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-18.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-261768" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-18.jpg" alt="Picture1" width="602" height="244" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-18.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-18-300x122.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-18-50x20.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<h2>$KENNY Rides the Hype Train &amp; Garners Influencer Approval</h2>
<p>Ethereum-based token $KENNY has already turned heads in the “shitcoin” space, thanks to its blend of humor and exciting tokenomics.</p>
<p>The token is gaining significant traction, with early investors able to snap up 40% of the total $KENNY supply while the presale is ongoing.</p>
<p>Priced at $0.0001875, this accessible entry point ensures even small-time investors can get involved.</p>
<p>Moreover, $KENNY’s low price has already led to speculation that the token could provide exponential gains once listed on public exchanges.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-26.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-261769" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-26.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="349" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-26.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-26-300x174.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-26-50x29.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>YouTube analyst Jacob Bury released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xHcMiFGPqg&amp;ab_channel=JacobCryptoBury" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">video</a> discussing his optimism around $KENNY, even going so far as to brand it a “new 10x potential meme coin”.</p>
<p>The Crypto Whale Pumps <a href="https://t.me/whalepumpgroup23/152" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Telegram channel</a>, with over 23,000 members, highlighted $KENNY as a &#8220;potential moonshot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given these mentions, it’s clear that the Burn Kenny presale has quickly captured the attention of influencers and crypto communities.</p>
<p>With the hype building rapidly, some seem to believe getting behind this micro-cap gem could provide the chance for considerable profits if $KENNY sees a trajectory similar to past meme coin presale launches.</p>
<h2>Burn Kenny Tokenomics Set Stage for Colossal Growth</h2>
<p><a href="https://bs_fa368e66.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=new-meme-coin-burn-kenny-token-presale-raises-370000-in-just-15-hours-how-to-participate" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Burn Kenny’s</a> innovative burn mechanism is a crucial factor that could further amplify the token’s value over time.</p>
<p>Just 24 hours after $KENNY’s DEX listing, the burn phase will commence, during which tokens are “burned” and permanently removed from circulation at a rate of 10% per day.</p>
<p>Per the Burn Kenny <a href="https://burnkenny.vip/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">whitepaper</a>, this will continue until 30% of the total $KENNY supply has been destroyed.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-25.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-261770" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-25.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="228" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-25.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-25-300x114.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-25-50x19.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>The deflationary model is strategic &#8211; as the token supply decreases, the remaining tokens may become more valuable due to supply and demand dynamics.</p>
<p>As such, the artificial scarcity brought about by this Burn Mechanism could help boost $KENNY’s price over time.</p>
<p>Deflationary setups like this have proved successful in the past, with Bitcoin ($BTC) and Shiba Inu ($SHIB) being two prominent examples.</p>
<p>If $KENNY can leverage its burn mechanism to achieve even a fraction of the success achieved by these crypto giants, huge profits could be in store for early adopters.</p>
<h2>Burn Kenny Aims to Emulate Success of Predecessor $HANKEY</h2>
<p>Burn Kenny&#8217;s promise is also based on the success of its predecessor, <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0x677d46d3abca5e2d3a2286c52809b51457dd2368" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mr Hankey Coin ($HANKEY)</a>.</p>
<p>The South Park-themed $HANKEY gained huge meme coin community support, leading its presale to sell out in 10 hours.</p>
<p>After this, $HANKEY debuted on Uniswap, where the token&#8217;s value rocketed by 3x.</p>
<p>This resounding success hints at the potential of South Park-themed coins that Burn Kenny can tap into.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-19.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-261771" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-19.jpg" alt="Picture4" width="602" height="231" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-19.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-19-300x115.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-19-50x19.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Furthermore, $KENNY’s liquidity setup has been designed to ensure stability and growth.</p>
<p>A generous 40% of the total $KENNY supply has been allocated to the DEX liquidity pool.</p>
<p>This substantial pool will help traders buy and sell tokens with minimal slippage.</p>
<p>Moreover, Burn Kenny’s team has also instituted a 3-month liquidity lock once the token makes its DEX debut – designed to deter large sell-offs from occurring.</p>
<p>With these measures in place and presale prices of just $0.0001875 per token, early community members believe now is the ideal time to get behind Burn Kenny before its price takes off.</p>
<h2>How to Buy $KENNY Token – Quick-Step Guide</h2>

			            <description><![CDATA[SBF and Wang allegedly misused $546 million of clients' funds to buy Robinhood shares, while Ellison awarded herself with a $29 million bonus. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">FTX Trading has reportedly filed a lawsuit against the former CEO of the exchange Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), and some people from his inner cycle to recoup more than $1 billion, which they supposedly misappropriated before the company&#8217;s demise. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Numerous regulators and fallen investors have accused the previous management team of the marketplace of orchestrating a gigantic crypto scam that eventually resulted in multi-billion losses. FTX Trading agreed with the assumption, maintaining that it was &#8220;one of the largest financial frauds in history.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Firing More Shots at SBF </span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The legal issues for the disgraced founder of FTX &#8211; Bankman-Fried &#8211; are piling up, with the latest accusation coming from the new team behind FTX Trading. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In a recent complaint filed in Delaware bankrupt court (seen by The Economic Times), he was </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/ftx-sues-sam-bankman-fried-others-to-recoup-more-than-1-billion/articleshow/101999855.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">accused</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> of swindling over $1 billion in customer funds between February 2020 and November 2022 (the time when the exchange filed for bankruptcy protection).</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">FTX Trading further claimed that Caroline Ellison (who was the leader of Alameda Research), Zixiao &#8220;Gary&#8221; Wang (former FTX technology executive), and Nishad Singh (ex-engineering director) also had a hand in the matter.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to the complaint, SBF and his inner cycle used the money to finance political campaigns, purchase luxury apartments, engage in speculative investments, and fund other &#8220;pet projects.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">FTX Trading claimed that the fraudulent transfers included over $725 million of equity that the once-leading crypto platform and West Realm Shires awarded &#8220;without receiving any value in exchange.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">SBF and Wang allegedly misappropriated $546 million to purchase Robinhood shares, whereas Ellison used almost $29 million to pay herself bonuses. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">John Ray Thinks FTX Misused Clients&#8217; Funds Since Day One</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The current CEO and Chief Restructuring Officer of FTX &#8211; John J. Ray III &#8211; has been quite a critic of the previous management crew of the exchange. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/ftx-misused-customer-funds-since-the-beginning-new-ceo-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">claimed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> last month that the company commingled customer deposits from the get-go in 2019 while former employees lied to banking institutions about using Alameda Research as a trading firm for transactions. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;The image that the FTX Group sought to portray as the customer-focused leader of the digital age was a mirage. From the inception of the FTX.com exchange, the FTX Group commingled customer deposits and corporate funds and misused them with abandon at the direction and by the design of previous senior executives,&#8221; Ray argued.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The American also maintained that the former crypto giant owed users $8.7 billion in November 2022. He concluded that the current management team has shrunk that debt, recovering $7 billion in liquid assets so far.</span></p>
