<p>The Web3 space is home to some of the most notable projects. However, the true value is typically gained from lesser-known altcoins with huge-growth potential. By getting into the early stages of a project, investors and traders have the ability to get a massive level of growth from their investments, as the project's popularity and momentum can push it forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aave (AAVE) has dipped in value, and Sparklo has gained a massive following from Web3 investors. Today, we will go over why this might be the case.</p>
<p>Aave (AAVE) Dips by 14.7%</p>
<p>On April 20, 2023, Balancer announced that the Aave (AAVE) V3 bbaUSD and wstETH/bb-a-weth Pools went live. This means that the liquidity provision has grown and that the DeFi building blocks are continuing to stack up.</p>
<p>Despite the announcement, the value behind the Aave (AAVE) altcoin has decreased. Specifically, on April 22, 2023, Aave (AAVE) was trading at $70.48. In the last seven days, Aave (AAVE) decreased in value by 14.7%. In the last 30 days, its overall value has been down by 6.8%, and this momentum behind Aave (AAVE) has left investors worried.</p>
<p>Sparklo (SPRK) To Revolutionize Web3 Investments</p>
<p>Sparklo will be an investment platform that enables users the opportunity to make fractionalized investments within silver, gold, and platinum.</p>
<p>This is a process that involves the procedure of minting non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on top of a blockchain, after which they are fractionalized. Investors can then purchase an entire NFT, after which it will be delivered to them, or just make a fractionalized investment in an NFT with an amount they feel comfortable with and can afford.</p>
<p>This makes the otherwise illiquid asset liquid, as a lot more people will be able to gain access to it.</p>
<p>The Future of Web3 Investments In Precious Metals</p>
<p>As experienced cryptocurrency investors know, investing in solid projects at their early stages is where significant gains can be made.</p>
<p>Sparklo will be bringing an alternative-investment platform, specifically made to enable anyone access to the precious metals market.</p>
<p>With a decentralized fractionalized investment and trading platform, anyone will gain the ability to begin investing in silver, gold, and platinum.</p>
<p>The SPRK token is trading at a value of just $0.015. Analysts predict that with the overall momentum of the market, the value can climb 40x in the upcoming months. The project was audited by the InterFi network, and its liquidity will also be locked for 100 years. This in-turn will make it completely safe for investors within the project.</p>
