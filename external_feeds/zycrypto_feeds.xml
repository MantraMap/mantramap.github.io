<p>Ripple Labs’ <a href="https://zycrypto.com/the-good-bad-and-the-complicated-from-the-sec-vs-ripple-verdict-as-bulls-envision-10-xrp-price/">split victory</a> over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) elicited waves of optimism for Coinbase in its case against the regulator. However, analysts have warned that the exchange still faces an uphill climb.</p>



<p>Berenberg Capital Markets noted in a new report that the SEC still has a strong case against Coinbase regarding the status of several offerings. According to the report, the allegations of Coinbase offering unregistered securities to the public hold substance as evidence in the exchange’s recent move.</p>



<p>Barely a day after the court ruled that XRP did not amount to a security, Coinbase moved to suspend the operations of its staking service in four U.S. states. Coinbase stated in its announcement that pausing its staking service is not an admission of guilt but is designed to allow the legal proceedings to run their full course.</p>



<p>However, Berenberg warned that halting the staking service “serves as a reminder to investors that Coinbase is far from being in the clear” The analysts cited a statement from Coinbase that although no customer has lost assets through staking, there are several risks associated with the offering.</p>



<p>Experts have pointed out that the SEC will be pinning the bulk of its argument on Coinbase’s submission that staking poses a measure of risk to investors.</p>



<p>Back in March, the SEC <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-action-against-coinbase-triggers-ballistic-reaction-from-crypto-community/">issued</a> a Wells notice to Coinbase confirming the start of enforcement action against the U.S.-based exchange. The SEC is accusing the exchange of running an unregistered securities exchange and offering the public unregistered securities through Coinbase Earn, its staking service.</p>



<p>Despite Berenberg’s warning, a number of Wall Street Banks have hailed XRP’s ruling as a net positive for Coinbase, expecting the exchange to include it in its defense.</p>



<p><em>“We view the ruling as incrementally positive for Coinbase, given the interpretation that in some cases a token may not be a security,”</em> said U.K.-based Barclays Bank. <em>“This may also provide incremental clarity for future token issuances.”</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-coinbase-faults-the-sec"><strong>Coinbase faults the SEC</strong></h2>



<p>While both parties head to court, Coinbase has made some scathing allegations against the SEC, eliminating a settlement option.</p>



<p>Coinbase refuted all allegations of breaching securities laws, saying that it had sought the SEC’s feedback on its crypto rules but received “none” from the commission.</p>



<p><em>“We also reiterated that we stand by our listings process &#8211; we don’t list securities today &#8211; and repeatedly invited the SEC to raise any questions about any asset at all on our platform,” </em><a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/we-asked-the-sec-for-reasonable-crypto-rules-for-americans-we-got-legal">said</a> Coinbase. <em>“We met with the SEC more than 30 times over nine months, but we were doing all of the talking.”</em></p>

<p>Stock market operator Nasdaq has ended its plans to provide its highly-anticipated crypto custody service, citing the ongoing regulatory conditions in the United States as the key reason for their decision. The service was scheduled to go live in the second quarter of this year. The sudden reversal of the custody plans marks a notable setback to the institutional adoption of crypto in the U.S.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nasdaq-halts-plan-for-institutional-crypto-custody-service"><strong>Nasdaq Halts Plan For Institutional Crypto Custody Service</strong></h2>



<p>CEO Adena Friedman announced that Nasdaq has dropped its plans for a Bitcoin custody service during the company’s Q2 results call.</p>



<p><em>“This quarter, considering the shifting business and regulatory environment in the United States, we have made the decision to halt our launch of the U.S. digital assets custodian business and our related efforts to pursue relevant license,” Friedman indicated.</em></p>



<p>The Nasdaq boss stressed that the firm would “remain committed to supporting the evolution of the digital asset ecosystem.” Friedman highlighted intentions to pursue collaborations with potential ETF issuers:</p>



<p>“We continue to build and deliver technology capabilities that position Nasdaq as a leading digital assets software solutions provider to the broader global industry.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A Bane For Crypto</strong></h2>



<p>News <a href="https://zycrypto.com/nasdaq-scales-up-crypto-ambitions-by-introducing-custody-service-for-institutional-players/">emerged </a>last year that Nasdaq was intending to roll out a crypto custody service in a bid to capture institutional investor interest. However, regulators in the U.S. have embarked on their most harrowing crackdown on crypto yet — initiating lawsuits against a number of high-profile companies.</p>



<p>The exchange operator had been awaiting permission from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) by the end of June to start offering custodial services to customers. Nasdaq was targeting a launch by the end of this month.</p>



<p>But the company has decided to rethink its involvement in the crypto custody business and its efforts to seek the requisite licenses for the service amid the regulatory uncertainty and heightened scrutiny of crypto-related offerings.</p>



<p>This surprising turnabout is a big blow to greater institutional adoption as concerns of a possible exodus of crypto firms to more friendly jurisdictions arise. Sadly, the U.S. is becoming a hostile place for the crypto industry to do business. The actions of the SEC and its chair Gary Gensler against the world&#8217;s foremost exchanges, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-suffers-double-whammy-as-sec-and-state-regulators-act-against-exchange-for-unregistered-securities/">Coinbase </a>and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">Binance</a>, have the crypto sector reeling.</p>



<p>Even so, there does seem to be institutional demand in the industry: BlackRock — and a slew of other prominent asset management firms — have <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-etfs-in-motion-an-analysis-of-open-spot-btc-etf-applications-in-the-market/">submitted </a>applications to launch spot Bitcoin ETF products. In fact, Nasdaq has partnered with BlackRock— the world’s largest asset manager — for the application, which is presently being <a href="https://zycrypto.com/approval-incoming-sec-officially-acknowledges-blackrocks-spot-bitcoin-etf-application/">examined </a>by the SEC.</p>

<p>In a landmark ruling, Judge Analisa Torres of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York sided with Fintech company Ripple and decided that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">XRP was not necessarily a security</a>. Ripple, the company behind the cryptocurrency, now expects U.S. banks and financial institutions to use XRP for cross-border payments.</p>



<p>In an interview with CNBC, Ripple&#8217;s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, said the company anticipates starting discussions with American financial institutions about adopting its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product. According to the San Francisco firm, XRP enables ODL to provide near-instantaneous money movement across borders.</p>



<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Ripple and its executives CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Executive Chair Chris Larsen, in December 2020, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">alleging the illegal sale of $1.3 billion worth of XRP</a>. Contrary to several of the SEC&#8217;s allegations against Ripple, the New York judge recently ruled that XRP was not, in essence, a security.</p>



<p>Stuart Alderoty was optimistic about the ruling prompting American banks to return to Ripple and utilize its ODL product, further stating, “I think we’re hopeful that this decision would give financial institution customers or potential customers comfort to at least come in and start having the conversation about what problems they are experiencing in their business, real-world problems in terms of moving value across borders without incurring obscene fees.”</p>



<p>Ripple uses ODL, which utilizes XRP as an intermediary currency, enabling instant liquidity sourcing and real-time fund transfers. ODL is used by various businesses, including payment service providers, fintech companies involved in business-to-business transactions, and organizations seeking to transfer internal treasury payments to foreign accounts.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ripple-s-customer-base"><strong>Ripple&#8217;s Customer Base</strong></h2>



<p>Interestingly while both Ripple and the SEC claim victory in the case, Judge Torres did make a split decision, granting that XRP itself was not a security. She also acknowledged that certain token sales qualified as securities transactions to institutional investors. The judge stated that approximately $728.9 million of such XRP sales did meet the criteria of securities, citing the ‘presence of a common enterprise and an expectation of profit’.</p>



<p>With Ripple&#8217;s core business operating outside the United States, most of its customers and revenue originate internationally. Although Ripple, which has approximately 900 employees globally, maintains a significant presence in the United States, Alderoty explained that since Ripple&#8217;s primary customer base is outside the United States, this aspect of the ruling would not immediately impact the company&#8217;s existing operations.</p>

<p>An extremely old Ether wallet has suddenly resurrected after eight long years of dormancy, moving pre-mined ETH worth $116 million to a Kraken wallet address. The tokens were accumulated during a sale event in June 2014 and have greatly increased in value over the years.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ethereum-ico-participant-wakes-from-8-year-slumber"><strong>Ethereum ICO Participant Wakes From 8-Year Slumber</strong></h2>



<p>Pre-mining era Ether, worth an eye-popping $116 million, moved wallets on July 18 after laying dormant for eight years, Etherscan <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x828d32346ae445ce058923642dd467261e69adae">data </a>shows. The wallet transferred all of its 61,216 ETH to an address on the Kraken exchange. On that day, its owner began with a cautionary transfer of 0.05 ETH to the Kraken address before proceeding to make the large-scale transfer.</p>



<p>Notably, moving $116 million worth of ETH required a mere transaction fee of $1.68 and 25.475673161 Gwei in gas price.</p>



<p>The Ethereum network held a sale event back in June 2014, allowing co-founders and early participants to purchase pre-mined Ether. This event was necessary because the Ethereum ecosystem couldn’t generate tokens on its own during this time and was also not being utilized for real use cases.</p>



<p>During the pre-mine period, the 61,216 Ether was bought at a price of between $300 and $400, which places the initial investment amount at around $20 million. At today’s price of $1,908, the value of those tokens has risen to over $116 million within the eight-year period.</p>



<p>The owner of the wallet remains unknown as of publication time. Still, holding his stash for eight whole years demonstrates the extent of hodling —  a popular investment strategy in the crypto community that prioritizes the long-term accumulation of crypto tokens. </p>



<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/10-year-dormant-bitcoin-whale-emerges-rakes-in-astonishing-38-million-profit/">Dormant wallets</a> with huge sums of crypto can resurrect for a string of reasons. Sometimes they have decided to cash in on big price increases. Other times, it&#8217;s simply because the owner may have been hacked. Nevertheless, such dormant whales&#8217; actions can substantially impact the market and investor sentiment. Monitoring any possible ripple effects from this latest multi-million-dollar transaction will be fascinating.</p>

<p>The eagerly awaited Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), which seeks to transform communication between the traditional finance (TradFi) and cryptocurrency ecosystems, has been made official by data provider <a href="https://zycrypto.com/tag/chainlink">Chainlink</a>. According to a Chainlink blog post, the protocol will make it possible for smooth cross-chain communication, encourage cooperation, and open up a wide range of opportunities for the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry. It is now accessible for early-access users on the Avalanche, Ethereum, Optimism, and Polygon blockchains.</p>



<p>With over 25 partner projects, including well-known players like the decentralized banking protocol Aave and the decentralized liquidity platform Synthetix, the CCIP, designed to create cross-chain apps and services, has been through rigorous testing. These early adopters set the bar for using CCIP&#8217;s capabilities because they understand its disruptive potential.</p>



<p>The relationship between Chainlink and SWIFT, the closed network banks use for international money transfers, has also been greatly aided by Chainlink&#8217;s CCIP. Chainlink and SWIFT recently announced plans to link various financial institutions to blockchain networks, with CCIP as the primary connector. Co-founder of Chainlink Sergey Nazarov voiced enthusiasm for this partnership&#8217;s pilot phase, saying that CCIP &#8220;could connect all of the blockchains and all of the bank chains.&#8221;</p>



<p>Chainlink has made CCIP accessible to all developers across five testnets, including Arbitrum Goerli, Avalanche Fuji, Ethereum Sepolia, Optimism Goerli, and Polygon Mumbai, as a sign of its dedication to supporting innovation and broad adoption. This starts the process of moving the protocol to mainnet general availability, where it will be available to users and developers everywhere.</p>



<p>The foundation of Chainlink&#8217;s CCIP is a strong security model that has supported the company&#8217;s renowned pricing oracles, recognized for their resilience against flash-loan assaults and other typical risks. The importance of CCIP was compared to the fundamental design of the internet by Sergey Nazarov, who said it aims to be the &#8220;TCP/IP of finance.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-major-finance-players-coming-on-board"><strong>Major Finance Players Coming on Board</strong></h2>



<p>In a statement to the online publication, DeCrypt, Nazarov stressed that the protocol&#8217;s promise extends beyond the world of cryptocurrencies and can help close the gap between traditional finance and digital assets. Major participants in the traditional finance industry, such as SWIFT, BNY Mellon, Citigroup, and BNP Paribas, have already started working with Chainlink.</p>



<p>“Through CCIP, we will create a private-public dynamic that will give access to traditional finance to digital assets and the cryptocurrency space to trillions of dollars”, Nazarov added.</p>



<p>According to Nazarov, this fusion of traditional banking with the blockchain industry marks a paradigm change. This market cycle is fueled by clients&#8217; persistent demand for crypto assets within conventional financial institutions, as opposed to earlier cycles entirely driven by token pricing. According to Nazarov, CCIP can revolutionize global banking, much like TCP/IP did when forming a unified internet architecture.</p>



<p>The CCIP protocol from Chainlink, which is currently operational and gathering support from pioneers and titans of the sector, can close the gap between traditional banking and the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The CCIP will transform the financial landscape and open the door for increased cooperation and innovation in the DeFi arena by enabling seamless communication and new opportunities.</p>

<p>Democratic presidential hopeful Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has pledged to restore strength to the United States dollar using <a href="https://zycrypto.com/tag/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a>. The Kennedy family scion also plans to exempt Bitcoin profits from capital gains tax.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-backing-the-dollar-with-bitcoin"><strong>Backing The Dollar With Bitcoin</strong></h2>



<p>Presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr has unveiled an ambitious plan that seeks to revolutionize the financial landscape of the U.S.</p>



<p>Speaking during the Heal-the-Divide PAC event on Wednesday, RFK claimed that backing the U.S. dollar with what he deemed “real finite assets” such as gold, silver, or Bitcoin, could help breathe life into the struggling economy and guarantee the status of the dollar as the world reserve currency.</p>



<p>“Backing dollars and U.S. debt obligations with hard assets could help restore strength back to the dollar, rein in inflation, and usher in a new era of American financial stability, peace, and prosperity.”</p>



<p>He noted that the process would be gradual and that he would revise the amount of backing for the dollar depending on the success of the audacious plan. “My plan would be to start very, very small, perhaps 1% of issued T-bills would be backed by hard currency, by gold, silver platinum or bitcoin,”<em> </em>he posited.</p>



<p>“Ironically we will be able to use bitcoin to save the U.S. dollar,&#8221; Kennedy added.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>RFK Vows To Exempt Bitcoin Profits From Capital Gains Tax</strong></h2>



<p>RFK has previously made waves in the cryptoverse, including when he made a pit stop at the biggest annual industry conference Bitcoin Miami where he declared that he’d “defend the right of self-custody of bitcoin and other digital assets.” He also revealed that his campaign is accepting BTC donations. It was also recently reported that Kennedy holds downwards of $250,000 in crypto.</p>



<p>The high-profile presidential challenger in the July 19 event that he would also exempt Bitcoin to U.S. dollar conversions from capital gains taxes. He said the proposed tax exemption would stimulate investment and encourage startups to establish their businesses within the United States instead of moving to other crypto-friendly jurisdictions like Singapore and Switzerland. In Kennedy’s view, making Bitcoin conversion a non-taxable event would foster innovation, safeguard privacy, and make it more difficult for governments to use digital currency against free speech.</p>



<p>FFK, who has been accused of circulating anti-vaxxer disinformation, has also been noted for his crypto enthusiasm in the past. The high-profile presidential challenger has been outspoken in his evangelism of crypto, including <a href="https://twitter.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1653808786577010697">bashing </a>a proposed 30% tax on crypto mining, describing the recent avalanche of regulatory enforcement actions against the sector as “an extra-legal war” that has harmed the U.S.’s economic prospects, and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/pro-crypto-presidential-candidate-robert-kennedy-jr-lauds-bitcoin-throws-shade-at-oppressive-cbdcs/">speaking against </a>“oppressive” central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).</p>

<p>ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood has updated her lofty Bitcoin price forecast. Wood now thinks the premier is going to $1.5 million by 2030. That&#8217;s under its bull-case scenario, while its base case sees BTC hitting $625,000 by that time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cathie-wood-says-her-confidence-in-btc-racing-toward-1-5-million-has-risen"><strong>Cathie Wood Says Her Confidence In BTC Racing Toward $1.5 Million Has Risen</strong></h2>



<p>Cathie Wood of Ark Invest — known for her previously <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cathie-wood-sticks-with-1-million-bitcoin-prediction-amid-maelstrom-of-regulatory-crackdowns-heres-why/">controversial $1 million price target</a> for Bitcoin— has just upped the ante.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wood highlighted her firm’s internal analysis during her latest <a href="https://twitter.com/DocumentingBTC/status/1681277645768540161">interview </a>with <em>Bloomberg </em>to explain her bullish outlook. “Our bull case, I think it&#8217;s $1,500,000 per coin, the best case is $625,000 (something like that),” the asset management titan posited.</p>



<p>As far as why her confidence in Bitcoin has increased, her reasoning boils down to this: the U.S. banking system turmoil that happened in March reinforced the flagship crypto’s long-term outlook to the upside. For Wood, Bitcoin acts as a great hedge against counterparty risk.</p>



<p>&#8220;Bitcoin is an insurance policy. We won&#8217;t have another &#8217;08-&#8217;09 crisis with Bitcoin. It&#8217;s decentralized and transparent,” she opined.</p>



<p>Wood has made no secret of her ultra-bullish stance. She made her first bold prediction in early 2021, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/amid-crypto-market-armageddon-ark-invests-cathie-wood-still-thinks-bitcoin-can-go-to-500000/">forecasting that BTC would reach $500,000 by 2026</a>, owing to the fact that more institutional investors would be moving into the digital asset. Early last year, she ratcheted up her prediction to $1 million per coin by 2030. At the time, ARK based its long-term call on the argument that the top crypto had the potential to “usurp 50% of gold’s role”.</p>



<p>ARK Invest offers several actively managed exchange-traded funds and holds $15 billion in assets under management. It’s hoping to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ark-invest-gains-edge-in-spot-bitcoin-etf-race-with-epic-surveillance-sharing-maneuver/">roll out a spot Bitcoin ETF product </a>in the near future.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Is Wood’s $1.5 Million Target Realistic Or Outlandish?</strong></h2>



<p>In this scenario, the market capitalization of Bitcoin — already the biggest token — would balloon to around $30 trillion from about $578 billion today, according to <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin">CoinGecko</a>. For comparison, the total value of the physical gold supply in the world is estimated to be around $12 trillion. This means that Bitcoin would be roughly 2.5 times more valuable than the entire gold market.</p>



<p>For now, BTC is trading hands at $29,753 after rallying to a new 13-month high of $31,800 on Thursday in the wake of the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">favorable court ruling for Ripple&#8217;s XRP</a>. The crypto is still 56.91% down from its all-time high of $69,044 recorded in November 2021.</p>



<p>It’s hard to say whether or not Wood’s pie-in-the-sky figure of $1.5 million can be considered well justified. Nonetheless, even a $1 million price target seems to be a bit too rosy for BTC bulls. That would indicate a market capitalization of circa $22 trillion, which is nearly 10x the current market value of Apple.</p>



<p>Time will tell whether Wood’s $1.5 million price prediction comes to fruition.</p>

<p>Binance, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, expressed disappointment and dissatisfaction with the recent complaint filed by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), alleging non-compliance issues by the exchange and its affiliated platform, Binance.US.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/sec-complaint-aims-to-unilaterally-define-crypto-market-structure-8707489117122437402">Binance</a>, they were taken by surprise by the SEC&#8217;s unilateral decision as the company was engaged in discussions with regulators to reach a negotiated agreement that would resolve the ongoing investigations.</p>



<p>However, the regulators chose to close those doors and proceed with <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">legal actions</a>. Binance considers this tactic &#8220;regrettable&#8221; given their collaborative efforts.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-binance-vs-sec-a-battle-for-the-future-of-the-crypto-industry"><strong>Binance vs. SEC: A Battle For The Future of The Crypto Industry</strong></h2>



<p>Binance indicated that despite the SEC&#8217;s limited jurisdiction over them as a non-U.S. exchange, they are ready to vigorously defend their platform and protect the interests of their users. Binance believes that the accusations brought forth by the SEC, under the guise of &#8220;emergency,&#8221; lack justification.</p>



<p>&#8220;Because Binance is not a U.S. exchange, the SEC&#8217;s actions are limited in reach. Still, we stand with digital asset market participants in the U.S., opposing the SEC&#8217;s latest overreach, and we are fully prepared to fight it within the boundaries of the law.&#8221;</p>



<p>Furthermore, Binance has highlighted the lack of clarity and guidance within the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cz-refutes-report-binance-is-considering-delisting-u-s-based-projects-in-face-of-crypto-regulatory-storm/">U.S. regulatory environment</a> for cryptocurrencies. They argue that this situation is hindering the country&#8217;s role as a global technological center by impeding progress and sector development.</p>



<p>Binance has emphasized that all user assets on their platforms, including Binance.US, remain secure and protected. They categorically refute any claims suggesting otherwise. These reassurances come in response to recent allegations published by Reuters, indicating that Binance commingled client funds with company revenue, thereby violating U.S. financial regulations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Hoskinson Warns of SEC&#8217;s Accusation For State-controlled CBDC</strong></h2>



<p>Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano and co-founder of Ethereum, indicated that the SEC&#8217;s accusation &#8220;seems like the next step in a series of measures to implement chokepoint 2.0 in the United States.&#8221; The ultimate goal, according to Hoskinson, is the launch of a state-controlled central bank digital currency (CBDC).</p>



<p>He further added that although this situation is not entirely unprecedented, it presents a perfect opportunity for the &#8220;fragmented&#8221; crypto industry to unite and confront regulators. Their aim is to prevent the country from falling into a dystopian state that would make the 1984 banking crisis look like a vacation.</p>

<p>According to a report recently released by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), current anti-money laundering (AML) policies are inadequate for effectively dealing with tax evasion in the cryptocurrency industry. The paper emphasized the growth of centralized institutions in the trading of crypto assets, providing tax authorities with a chance to gather crucial ownership data.</p>



<p>Contrary to the initial vision of crypto designers, centralized institutions, particularly exchanges, now play a vital role in cryptocurrency transactions. These institutions possess the ability to gather ownership information, making them pivotal in ongoing efforts to acquire useful third-party data that can be shared with tax authorities. Incorporating AML provisions to cover services relating to crypto transactions is crucial in this regard.</p>



<p>According to the IMF, AML standards are essential in the fight against money laundering and in assisting tax authorities. The standards include &#8220;know your customer&#8221; (KYC) guidelines, the submission of suspicious transaction reports (STRs), and the inclusion of customer information with transactions (referred to as &#8220;travel rules&#8221;). The United States applied AML regulations to cryptocurrency transactions as early as 2013 while the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) published guidance on how to put those requirements into practice in 2015. Over in the European Union, past legislation in the block did not cover cryptocurrencies, with a proposal for an updated regulation that would align with FATF recommendations is currently pending Council approval.</p>



<p>KYC provisions have proven invaluable in serving &#8220;John Doe&#8221; notices to crypto brokers, allowing the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to gather information on US taxpayers involved in cryptocurrency transactions exceeding $20,000 between 2016 and 2021. Similarly, the IMF points out, in the UK, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has utilized KYC rules to inform and remind crypto owners of their tax obligations. Recognizing tax crimes as a predicate offence for money laundering enables tax authorities to access the information collected by financial institutions under AML rules. However, in practice, AML rules alone are often insufficient from a tax perspective.</p>



<p>The IMF report highlights the limitations of AML rules in facilitating effective taxation concerning cryptocurrencies and, more broadly. The OECD reported in 2015 that only 20% of tax administrations surveyed had direct access to STRs, relying heavily on financial intelligence units to share potentially tax-relevant information. Additionally, tax administrations face obstacles in accessing the information generated by compliant financial institutions due to non-compliance by some jurisdictions with FATF guidelines.</p>



<p>Tax authorities aspire to secure the direct and automatic sharing of information on crypto transactions to address these challenges, similar to the established practice for traditional financial transactions. In the United States, the Infrastructure Improvement and Jobs Act, passed in November 2021, mandates digital service providers to report customer transaction details annually to the IRS, mirroring reporting requirements for bonds and shares. Furthermore, businesses are required to report crypto asset transactions exceeding $10,000, resembling the pre-existing rule for cash payments. Similar measures have been introduced in Brazil, where legal entities and individuals are obligated to report operations involving crypto assets.</p>



<p>However, applying reporting rules to domestic institutions may inadvertently drive transactions to mechanisms not subject to these rules or foreign exchanges that do not share information with domestic tax authorities. The IMF states that research suggests that actions targeted at specific exchanges may decrease activity on those exchanges but increase legal avoidance activity in crypto markets overall. Effective cross-border exchange of information is crucial, but existing frameworks were not originally designed to accommodate cryptocurrencies, creating uncertainties and potential gaps. The OECD has proposed a framework for cross-border exchange of information on crypto transactions, which could be built upon by member states.</p>



<p>Tax administrations currently have a limited amount of directly usable data on crypto ownership and transactions. To learn more about blockchain topologies, users can use publicly accessible data on unpermissioned blockchains and forensic analysis tools. To discover potentially tax-relevant behaviours and create connections with data collected from sources outside the blockchain, artificial intelligence technologies and conventional investigative techniques can both be used.</p>



<p>While the challenges posed by quasi-anonymity and technical complexity persist, tax administrations can employ other measures to encourage self-reporting, such as taxpayer education and targeted nudges. Large-scale actions and seizures can serve as deterrents, sending a clear message that authorities can uncover sophisticated schemes and hold individuals accountable.</p>



<p>To effectively combat tax fraud within the cryptoverse, IMF research emphasises the need for stricter laws and global cooperation. By addressing the shortcomings of AML rules, implementing robust reporting requirements, and promoting cross-border information exchange, tax authorities can strive to ensure the integrity of tax systems in the evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>In the realm of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin has long held the throne as the pioneering digital asset, capturing the attention of investors and enthusiasts worldwide. While recent market conditions have left some longing for excitement, the relentless pursuits of Bitcoin&#8217;s formidable players—sharks and whales—continue unabated.</p>



<p>Despite prices languishing within the $30,000 to $31,000 range, a fascinating trend has emerged: according to the data from <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1677805758216556544?t=XheAGpRp5UH9SOL0dVFxJw&amp;s=19">Santiment</a>, from June 17th onwards, addresses holding 10 to 10,000 BTC have collectively acquired an impressive 71,000 additional coins, amassing a staggering value of $2.15 billion. This article explores the actions of these influential entities and the potential implications for the market.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bitcoin-sharks-and-whales-the-dominant-forces-of-accumulation">Bitcoin Sharks and Whales: The Dominant Forces of Accumulation</h2>



<p>Within the complex ecosystem of Bitcoin, whales represent the largest and most influential players. With their immense holdings of Bitcoin, often ranging in the thousands or tens of thousands, they possess the power to steer market sentiment with their strategic movements. In recent weeks, these whales have showcased an unwavering appetite for <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-price-fall-ignites-huge-buy-the-dip-moment-for-whales-as-btc-accumulation-heightens/">accumulation</a>, defying the perceived monotony in the market. Their substantial purchases suggest a steadfast belief in Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term prospects and resilience, irrespective of short-term price fluctuations.</p>



<p>Agile and opportunistic sharks complement the whales. These entities thrive on exploiting market volatility and capitalizing on price fluctuations. Although their holdings may not rival the whales, their impact on market dynamics should not be underestimated. Known for their ability to make swift, calculated trades, these sharks possess a keen sense of timing, allowing them to seize opportunities within the $30,000 to $31,000 price range. Their actions, alongside those of the whales, contribute to the narrative that Bitcoin&#8217;s elite players remain undeterred by the lack of excitement.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Market Implications: Concentration and Potential Volatility</h2>



<p>These prominent players&#8217; consistent accumulation of Bitcoin carries significant implications for the broader cryptocurrency market. As whales and sharks <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-shrimps-and-crabs-accumulate-btc-aggressively-amid-heightened-institutional-interest/">accumulate</a> additional coins, the ecosystem&#8217;s wealth concentration intensifies. This concentration could amplify market volatility, as their actions have the potential to trigger cascading effects throughout the market. However, it is essential to consider alternative perspectives: their accumulation may reflect a belief in an imminent <a href="https://zycrypto.com/microstrategys-saylor-envisions-250k-btc-price-following-bitcoins-soaring-dominance/">price surge</a> or serve as a defensive strategy against market downturns. Ultimately, the motivations of these influential actors remain subject to interpretation and conjecture.</p>



<p>While market observers may perceive Bitcoin&#8217;s current price range as monotonous, the actions of its whales and sharks suggest a different narrative altogether. Their strategic acquisitions reflect a profound belief in Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term potential and contribute to the ongoing narrative surrounding the digital asset&#8217;s resilience. As the market continues to evolve, the activities of these dominant players will undoubtedly shape the future trajectory of Bitcoin, leaving investors and enthusiasts eagerly awaiting their next move.</p>

<p>The tides are shifting the crypto market of late. Frenzied trading has pushed XRP to garner trading volumes higher than those of Bitcoin, otherwise leading the pack in trading volumes. The positive sentiment around XRP comes after <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">Ripple’s legal win</a> against the U.S. Securities and Exchange (SEC).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-xrp-trading-volume-dwarfs-bitcoin-s"><strong>XRP Trading Volume Dwarfs Bitcoin’s</strong></h2>



<p>XRP has flipped Bitcoin to become the crypto asset with the highest trading volume.</p>



<p>Data from CoinMarketCap shows that XRP has registered roughly $25 billion in total trading volume since July 13, suggesting investors are confident in the token. The rapid volume surge came after a judge <a href="https://zycrypto.com/the-good-bad-and-the-complicated-from-the-sec-vs-ripple-verdict-as-bulls-envision-10-xrp-price/">ruled </a>that the sale of Ripple’s XRP tokens on exchanges and via algorithms did not constitute securities following a two-year legal battle instigated by the SEC.</p>



<p>On the day of the ruling, July 13, the trading volume of XRP pairs on centralized exchanges hit over $10 billion, which is <a href="https://twitter.com/rovercrc/status/1679517125264785409">deemed </a>the biggest volume in the last one and a half years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digital asset market research firm Kaiko <a href="https://twitter.com/KaikoData/status/1680865430741700608">observed </a>that “XRP has surpassed BTC as the highest volume asset.” For context, XRP dominated a staggering 21% of all crypto trade volume, while BTC contributed 20%. Ether — the second-largest crypto by market capitalization — made up for 8% of all volume, whilst other altcoins combined were responsible for 51% of the crypto volume.</p>



<p>The trading frenzy happened as Coinbase, Kraken, and other cryptocurrency exchanges<a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-overtakes-bnb-coin-as-fourth-most-valuable-crypto-as-coinbase-announces-relisting/"> re-listed </a>or revealed plans to restart trading with the token on their platforms for U.S. customers after the partially favorable court decision on Thursday.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>New XRP ATH In The Coming Months?</strong></h2>



<p>In December 2020, the SEC <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">filed </a>a civil complaint against Ripple, its CEO Bradley Garlinghouse, and co-founder Chris Larsen, claiming failure to register XRP as a security before selling over $1.2 billion worth to the public. Long years of Twitter spats and legal advances followed as Ripple tried to argue how fundamentally wrong it is to classify XRP as a security.</p>



<p>XRP’s price has endured periods of turmoil in the last few years since the suit was announced. But the recent days have seen the token enjoying a euphoric price rally.</p>



<p>According to Leonidas Hadjiloizou, a long-time cryptocurrency researcher, XRP’s July 13 $10 billion volume marked only the 76th largest daily trading volume.</p>



<p>“Even though this seems like a big number, historically, this was XRP’s 76th largest daily trading volume recorded on CMC. The highest was almost $37 billion on April 6th, 2021. We ain’t seen nothing yet,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/LeoHadjiloizou/status/1680595490185023488/">tweeted</a>.</p>



<p>This suggests that the XRP price could reach a new record high in the coming months, <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptoassetsguy/status/1680596315338571776">according to</a> some observers on Twitter.</p>

<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially acknowledged another Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) proposal for regulatory review, marking another bullish signal for Bitcoin (BTC). This time, SEC acceptance comes for the financial services firm Valkyrie, which has adopted ‘BRRR’ as the ticker for its ETF.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-valkyrie-spot-bitcoin-etf-application-acknowledged-by-sec"><strong>Valkyrie Spot Bitcoin ETF Application Acknowledged By SEC</strong></h2>



<p>The U.S. SEC has accepted Valkyrie’s application for a spot Bitcoin ETF following its <a href="https://zycrypto.com/approval-incoming-sec-officially-acknowledges-blackrocks-spot-bitcoin-etf-application/">acknowledgement of similar applications </a>by BlackRock and Bitwise in recent days.</p>



<p>The watchdog added Valkyrie&#8217;s proposal to launch the Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund to its <a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nasdaq.htm#SR-NASDAQ-2023-019">official docket</a> on Monday.</p>



<p>The SEC’s acknowledgement signifies the start of the official review process for Valkyrie’s ETF bid. With Valkyrie’s proposal now on the SEC&#8217;s official calendar, it will be published in the Federal Register and trigger a 21-day public comment period. While it’s an initial step in a long regulatory journey, it suggests the SEC’s willingness to explore the idea of a spot Bitcoin ETF and assess its potential effects on the market. </p>



<p>Valkyrie <a href="https://zycrypto.com/spot-bitcoin-etf-craze-valkyrie-becomes-the-latest-firm-to-apply-for-sec-approval/">refiled </a>paperwork with the SEC for its longstanding Bitcoin ETF proposal last month, just five days after BlackRock&#8217;s novel ETF submission. The Tennessee-based asset manager has selected ‘BRRR’ as the ticker symbol for its ETF — alluding to the popular meme that symbolizes the sound of money printing.</p>



<p>Valkyrie adjusted its spot Bitcoin ETF application on July 5 to include an agreement for “surveillance-sharing” with cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, just like BlackRock. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, banging on the SEC’s door is significant owing to its prominence in finance.</p>



<p>A spot Bitcoin ETF has been deemed a holy grail for the industry and would mirror the value of BTC without requiring institutional investors to store the asset themselves. It would also be tradable on a conventional stock exchange, much like shares in popular companies such as Apple and Microsoft.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Acceptance Bullish For Bitcoin Price</strong></h2>



<p>The SEC is also reviewing applications for funds, including Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust, WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust, VanEck Bitcoin Trust, and Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF, which also entered a three-week comment period.</p>



<p>Going back to 2013, the SEC has long stonewalled proposals for a spot Bitcoin ETF. Nonetheless, the latest competition among firms vying to be the first to launch a Bitcoin ETF in the United States is seen by many as a bullish development for the crypto industry.</p>



<p>The potential SEC endorsement of a spot ETF would equate to a seal of approval for Bitcoin from the securities watchdog. Moreover, the regulatory green light would introduce a fresh capital inflow into the BTC market.</p>

<p>U.S. Judge Sarah Netburn has directed the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs to determine three mutually convenient days for a potential settlement conference. This is the latest development following a recent legal ruling. The ruling stated that programmatic sales of XRP to retail investors did not constitute securities, resulting in a parabolic rally in the XRP price.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ripple-v-sec-settlement-imminent"><strong>Ripple v. SEC Settlement Imminent?</strong></h2>



<p>SEC litigation against Ripple Labs Inc. has kept crypto on edge since late 2020 by presenting the prospect that crypto assets are securities that fall under the commission’s tough regulatory purview. But even as a ruling last week seemed to undermine the regulator’s case, the issue is far from settled. However, this could change soon.</p>



<p>Judge Sarah Netburn has<a href="https://twitter.com/eleanorterrett/status/1681032363873124357"> reportedly ordered </a>both Ripple and the SEC to find three mutually convenient dates for a possible settlement conference “if they believe it would be productive at this time”.</p>



<p>Netburn urged the two parties to schedule this meeting six to eight weeks in advance due to the court’s busy calendar.</p>



<p>A settlement conference refers to a meeting between the parties in a suit where they try to reach an amicable resolution to their brawl, therefore avoiding a lengthy trial. In the case of the Ripple vs SEC dispute, Judge Netburn&#8217;s proposal of scheduling a settlement conference signifies a chance for both parties to resolve the conflict without moving the case forward to a trial.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>SEC Can Appeal Ripple Ruling</strong></h2>



<p>Netburn’s settlement recommendation comes after a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">crucial win for Ripple</a> on July 13. The judge in the proceedings ruled that the XRP token sales on digital asset exchanges weren’t securities even though sales and distribution of XRP directly to institutions were deemed investment contracts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The cryptosphere delighted in the implication of likely limits to the SEC’s authority to extend a clampdown on an industry it contends is rife with dangerous practices. As a result of Ripple’s partial victory, XRP has been trending upward, potentially implying that it could <a href="https://zycrypto.com/the-good-bad-and-the-complicated-from-the-sec-vs-ripple-verdict-as-bulls-envision-10-xrp-price/">hit $10</a>. In fact, a lot of crypto exchanges in the U.S. felt that the ruling was a real win for Ripple and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/jpmorgan-calls-ripples-landmark-xrp-decision-a-milestone-win-for-crypto-industry-but-theres-a-catch/">relisted XRP</a>.</p>



<p>However, some spectators <a href="https://twitter.com/CGasparino/status/1681061448946991107">believe </a>that the summary judgment may rest on precarious ground and may not translate to the crypto sector’s much-anticipated change in the way it&#8217;s treated by the SEC. This is because SEC chairman Gary Gensler has <a href="https://twitter.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1680997005944934401">hinted </a>that the agency is strongly considering an appeal against Judge Torres’ recent decision in the high-profile enforcement case against Ripple and pledged to continue with enforcement actions.</p>

<p>The Lightning Network is a second-layer expansion solution built on the Bitcoin blockchain. This network enables users to establish off-chain transaction pipelines, ensuring faster, more affordable, and scalable transactions while mitigating congestion issues on the cryptocurrency blockchain.</p>

<p>In May, the Binance exchange confirmed that it would bring Lightning Network support after the exchange could not offer Bitcoin withdrawals smoothly even with high gas fees.</p>

<p>Before Binance, only a certain number of cryptocurrency exchanges (such as Bitfinex, River Financial, OKX, Kraken, CoinCorner, etc.) offered Bitcoin withdrawals via the Lightning Network, but now Binance is on this list.</p>



<p>In April of this year, the U.S. public cryptocurrency exchange also confirmed that it will bring customers Bitcoin Lightning Network withdrawal support.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Binance and Regulatory Hurdles</strong></h2>



<p>Over the years, Binance has ranked among the top cryptocurrency exchanges for its highly secure and responsive services.</p>



<p>Despite the better service, the exchange faces a formidable legal hurdle in the U.S. due to regulatory action by two of the country’s top financial regulators against its cryptocurrency services.</p>



<p>Currently, the exchange is focused on making some major changes to its services to be able to easily comply with the new rules and regulations set out under the framework of the European Union (EU) Market in Cryptocurrency Assets (MiCA), which will at some stage in the coming years take effect.</p>
