<p>The Solana network has been on a tear this month, experiencing a substantial increase in its user base, leading to the successful breach of the critical $20 price resistance level for its native cryptocurrency SOL.</p>



<p>Despite being generally in the red this month, Solana&#8217;s price has been on an upward trajectory since last Thursday, surging roughly 10%. Over the past 24 hours, the tenth largest crypto asset by market cap has increased by about 1.2% and was trading at $20.72 at press time on Monday.</p>



<p>SOL’s growth can be attributed to several factors, key among them the impressive surge in the number of active users on the Solana network. According to data from Dune Analytics, the number of active Solana users on May 1 skyrocketed to roughly 3.5 million, marking an astonishing 146% surge compared to April 1. This surge brings the total number of unique active users on Solana&#8217;s network to an all-time high of 39.75 million.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="596" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-35-1024x596.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81649" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-35-1024x596.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-35-300x175.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-35-768x447.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-35.png 1360w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>According to experts, the surge in Solana&#8217;s user base can be attributed to the high transaction fees on <a href="https://zycrypto.com/solana-surpasses-ethereum-in-most-on-chain-active-addresses/">Ethereum</a> and other networks, particularly those involving NFTs, which have prompted users to explore alternative Layer 1 networks, with a considerable number migrating to Solana.</p>



<p>On Sunday, May 28, Tom Dunleavy, a former analyst at onchain analysis firm Messari highlighted Solana&#8217;s exponential growth in user numbers noting that Solana has experienced a massive spike in active users this month, making it difficult for Ethereum maximalists to ignore the platform.</p>



<p><em>“Even if you are an Eth maxi hard to not have a small allocation here with so users, devs and call options not priced in (ie mobile, neon, things eth can&#8217;t do (ie order book, xnfts)”</em> tweeted Dunleavy.</p>



<p>Solana’s popularity has also been fueled by the network’s expansion into AI with a new Chat GPT plugin. The plug-in, which Solana Labs had <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sol-jumps-over-8-as-solana-makes-groundbreaking-entry-into-ai-with-chatgpt-plugin/">hinted at</a> in late April, was eventually integrated into the network last week and is aimed at facilitating user onboarding into the web3 space. Among many other uses, the plug-in allows users to perform various tasks such as buying and listing NFTs, token transfers, transaction tracking and discovering NFT collections based on their floor prices.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, despite Solana’s explosion in the network activity, its total volume locked (TVL) had dropped slightly from about 280 million at the start of April to 270 million at press time, <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Solana?tvl=true">according</a> to DefiLlama.</p>



<p>That said, despite the slowdown in TVL, Solana’s surging user base and positive price momentum have relieved investors who are still contending with the post-FTX debacle losses. As users seek alternatives to high-fee networks, Solana&#8217;s performance and increasing adoption could help get SOL’s price out of the woods.</p>

<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s volatility persisted on the final day of May as prices continued to drop amidst a broader pullback in the crypto market.</p>



<p>Last Sunday, Bitcoin showed signs of recovery with a 4% surge, reaching $28,400. However, the gains were short-lived, and over the past three days, the price retraced, wiping out more than half of the previous gains and potentially setting the trend for June.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, despite the sharp price drop, several key metrics within the Bitcoin market indicate the potential for a bullish trend. On Tuesday, pseudonymous analyst “Cryptohell” from onchain analytics firm Cryptoquant highlighted the declining supply of BTC circulating on exchanges, a key indicator of a potential bull run.</p>



<p>In a post on the firm’s website, the pundit noted that since May 1, 2023, the exchange reserve metric had experienced a substantial decline, indicating a reduction in the amount of Bitcoin held on exchanges.</p>



<p><em>“At least the amount of Bitcoin circulating on exchanges has decreased in the past month. Specifically, if we calculate based on the Exchange Reserve USD metric, it indicates that exchanges have lost approximately $7 billion worth of Bitcoin,” </em>he wrote.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="645" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-33-1024x645.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81629" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-33-1024x645.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-33-300x189.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-33-768x484.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-33.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Furthermore, the pundit highlighted the deposit trend, which also exhibited a decline throughout the past month. He also analyzed historical transaction data from July 2019, concluding that it revealed a similar decrease in deposit transactions preceding a BTC price increase that preceded the May 2020 halving event. Based on these findings and considering the upcoming halving, Cryptohell concluded that these findings suggest a potentially positive market trend.</p>



<p>Another analyst from the same company, known as &#8220;onchain&#8221;, pointed out the UTXO Value Bands indicator, a tool to measure how much Bitcoin large investors are <a href="https://zycrypto.com/long-term-bitcoin-holders-defy-market-uncertainty-setting-the-stage-for-further-growth/">accumulating</a>. This indicator looks at the different values of Bitcoin being held and helps identify trends in the overall Bitcoin supply. When there is an increase in the percentage of Bitcoin held in the +10K BTC band, it means that significant investors are accumulating more Bitcoin. The pundit shared a chart showing that the number of Bitcoins held in this band has increased from 1,742,300 BTC to 1,774,200 BTC, suggesting a potential increase in demand and a subsequent price rise.</p>



<p>Echoing the sentiment of cautious accumulation, onchain analytics firm Santiment <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1663295838565838848">tweeted</a> on May 30 that addresses holding between 10 and 10,000 Bitcoins have accumulated a combined total of 93,000 BTC during the price fluctuations witnessed between $26,000 and $30,000 over the past month.</p>



<p>That said, despite the decline in price and the numerous fluctuations in the market, these crucial metrics indicate the possibility of a bullish trend for Bitcoin. Investors are thus likely to consider these indicators alongside their other price analysis tools to gain valuable insights into the cryptocurrency’s price trajectory.</p>

<p>At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $27,068, down 3% over the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sandeep Nailwal has tipped blockchain gaming to become the biggest driver of the next digital asset mass adoption.</li>



<li>Polygon partners with Immutable X to develop next-generation scalable blockchain games built on Polygon’s zk-rollup technology.</li>



<li>Polygon’s alleged centralization comes under scrutiny once more, but Nailwal debunks the claims with facts. </li>
</ul>



<p>Blockchain gaming boasts a $4.6 billion market capitalization with an expected growth of 70% to hit $60 billion by 2027, according to a MarketsandMarkets Analysis.</p>



<p>Sandeep Nailwal, a co-founder of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/polygon-whale-moves-millions-in-matic-as-the-networks-exchange-supply-jumps-to-5-week-high/">Polygon</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/13qngw0/hi_rindia_i_am_sandeep_nailwal_cofounder_of/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">believes</a> the once-bubbling blockchain gaming industry can make a comeback and drive the next mass adoption of crypto. Addressing the community on Reddit, he was asked about real-life uses of cryptocurrencies apart from payments. </p>



<p>He responded by tipping blockchain games as the future of the industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>I think gaming is the largest scale opportunity for crypto. There are some top games launching in Web3 in the next 6-18 months and it would be very interesting to see if some of them are able to crack the crypto code. Last year itself there was $2 billion+ in funding for Web3 games,”</em> he said.</p>



<p><em>Polygon combined with its ecosystem players like IMX [Immutable X], got the lion&#8217;s share in terms of those funded games. Fingers crossed for some of them to go big,”</em> he added.</p>



<p>The community also sought clarity why digital assets have become too speculative. Nailwal did not deny the speculative nature of crypto but stated that it has become the “<em>boon and band of crypto.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Boon because it attracts top talent towards the industry, bane because obviously, a large number of users and applications are speculative in nature. But one could argue that any potential big industry invites a lot of speculation early on. It was the same with the Gold rush area and it was also the same for the Dot com boom,” </em>he added.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-users-question-centralization"><strong>Users question centralization</strong></h2>



<p>Concluding the session with the community, users questioned the centralization of most web3 firms despite their decentralization claims. Nailwal noted that only Bitcoin and Ethereum have achieved better decentralization, as the rest are still playing catch up. </p>



<p>“<em>Crypto is still in its nascent stage. I don’t believe that any blockchain ecosystem, except Bitcoin and Ethereum, is fully decentralized yet. It’s not necessarily important that networks are fully decentralized from the get-go,” </em>he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, Polygon’s Nakamoto Coefficient was described as being too low by users. Nakamoto&#8217;s Coefficient rating measures a network’s level of decentralization. Polygon has a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/13qngw0/hi_rindia_i_am_sandeep_nailwal_cofounder_of/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">rating</a> of four according to NakaFlow, indicating that four nodes control a third of Polygon. </p>



<p>Nailwal explained that the network has two chains with the Polygon POS and not the Polygon zkEVM having a low Nakamoto Coefficient. He, however noted that the Polygon POS will become more decentralized.</p>



<p>“<em>Eventually we expect all public (non-app-specific) chains to have large decentralization factors, and we are working on some really big releases in the coming days. The eventual goal is to take the Polygon ecosystem to have 1000s of validators.” </em></p>

<p>XRP, a digital coin often used to make international payments, has stolen the crypto market spotlight once again after hitting the key $0.5 resistance mark— a potential signal of how investors feel regarding an ongoing legal battle<a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/217017/ripple-industry-wait-to-see-if-xrp-case-will-be-a-small-splash-or-a-tsunami-for-crypto"> </a>brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against associated blockchain payments firm Ripple.</p>



<p>XRP posted as much as 5 percent in gains over the past 24 hours to trade at $0.511 at the time of writing, according to CoinGecko data. The upward price action was accompanied by an impressive 82.37% spike in trading volume during the same timeframe.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-xrp-making-waves"><strong>XRP Making Waves</strong></h2>



<p>XRP has been on a roll in recent days following reports the SEC’s landmark case against Ripple was tilting in favour of the San Francisco-based firm. Today, a sudden spike in trading volume hurled the XRP price above the important $0.5 level.</p>



<p>XRP currently has a $26 billion market cap, which translates into a 24-hour increase of 4.68 percent. Perhaps even more notably, XRP is the top gainer among major tokens as it is now up 13.46 percent over the past seven days.</p>



<p>On-chain analytics firm Santiment recently<a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1663349921205088257"> pointed out</a> that XRP has enjoyed the second and third-largest surges in address activity in history in the last 2 days. Compared to a similar occurrence on March 18, expecting further price appreciation for XRP is reasonable. Should history repeat itself, the token’s price could jump 45% in the space of 10 days following the latest increase in activity.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What’s Next For XRP Price?</strong></h2>



<p>There does not appear to have been a clear catalyst for today’s XRP upsurge. However, it could be an indication that the bulls anticipate some truly good news about XRP and its ecosystem in the near future. For one, some insiders believe the SEC v. Ripple case is about to come to an end. Finally.</p>



<p>Notably, U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres recently <a href="https://zycrypto.com/groundbreaking-ripple-win-in-xrp-case-looking-likely-as-court-rejects-secs-request-to-keep-hinman-docs-hidden/">dismissed </a>the SEC&#8217;s motion to seal the Commission’s internal communications that occurred before a speech by its former director, Willian Hinman, in June 2018. In that speech, Hinman posited that the Ether token is not a security asset.</p>



<p>The unsealing of these documents could push Ripple toward a critical legal victory, given its ability to prove that XRP is also not a security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-ripple-boss-confident-groundbreaking-verdict-is-coming-in-weeks-after-hinman-speech-docs-win/">expressed confidence</a> that a final verdict in the lawsuit could be coming “in weeks”. Ripple’s win will undoubtedly set off a mega-bullish impulse for XRP as well as bring cheer to the broader crypto market, but a defeat could rekindle risk aversion.</p>

<ul>
<li>Bitcoin trades at a huge discount on Binance Australia if paid for using the Australian Dollar as the fiat deadline nears.</li>



<li>Traders looking to cash in on the discounted BTC were stunned by the inability to deposit Australian dollars in wallets and other conversion obstacles.</li>



<li>Binance continues to experience difficulties in Australia as its derivatives license was rescinded by regulators last month.</li>
</ul>



<p>Binance announced on May 18 that it would shut its Australian dollar services due to a decision from its third-party agent in the country. A move that may have triggered chaos.</p>



<p>Bitcoin (BTC) is trading for about $22,000 on Binance Australia, a massive 21% drop when traded against the Australian dollar. The massive discount comes as the deadline for local bank withdrawals in Australian dollars nears.</p>



<p>At press time, one BTC exchanges hands globally for $26,953 but trades in Binance Australia at roughly  $21,998. Binance <a href="https://twitter.com/binance_aus/status/1659018600496373760?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">informed</a> users that funds left in AUD will be converted to USD Tether but even that has failed to stop the panic in the markets.</p>



<p>The panic and rush to cash out have led to the price being largely discounted at a 21% rate. A Binance spokesperson has confirmed the position adding that the platform will look for an alternative soon.</p>



<p>“<em>Due to the recent removal of fiat on-ramp services by our payment processor’s banking partner, some Australian users have been withdrawing their AUD holdings from the platform in advance of the off-ramp closure on 1 June. As a result, AUD pairs have experienced less liquidity which has impacted their pricing. We will be delisting the remaining AUD pairs in line with the closure of fiat off-ramp services. We remain focused on securing additional fiat relationships to serve our users.”</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-no-room-for-arbitrage-gains"><strong>No room for arbitrage gains</strong></h2>



<p>A 21% discount on the price of Bitcoin is a good arbitrage opportunity with many tweeting on plans for a huge gain. However, traders now face certain hurdles as the platform has halted deposits in Australian dollars coupled with the popular asset conversion now becoming a Herculean task due to the premium placed on it.</p>



<p>Furthermore, while the company has announced a search for an alternative local payment provider, it will delist several trading pairs on the AUD on June 1 telling users to <em>“pay attention to the risks when trading.”</em></p>



<p>The exchange is under fire for that decision as analysts have described it as compounding the woes of users in a short period. Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, is under regulatory <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-prepares-to-pay-fines-to-settle-outstanding-u-s-regulatory-probes/">pressure</a> from many jurisdictions including Australia.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/tag/Solana/">Solana</a>, a blockchain platform renowned for its quick and inexpensive transactions, is competing to become the &#8220;next Apple&#8221; of the cryptocurrency realm. Despite repeated outages that have prompted questions about its stability and grandiose plans, Solana is adamant about capturing the crypto crown.</p>



<p>The fundamental objective of Solana is to provide a blockchain infrastructure that can facilitate the widespread adoption of dApps and promote innovation across multiple industries. Solana Co-founder Raj Gokal spoke about this in a recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/29/solanas-crypto-raj-gokal-interview/">interview</a> with Techcrunch+ and underlined the value of performance and scalability in realizing this vision, which has been Solana&#8217;s main area of concentration.</p>



<p>But repeated <a href="https://zycrypto.com/after-over-10-network-outages-solana-proposes-a-genius-solution-to-solve-debacle/">Solana outages</a> have prompted questions about the blockchain&#8217;s capacity to keep its promises. The platform experienced two big issues the previous month that caused network disruption and a transaction halt. Critics questioned the dependability of Solana&#8217;s infrastructure as a result of the dissatisfied users.</p>



<p>In response to these worries, Gokal admitted the outages and blamed them on the platform&#8217;s quick expansion. He reassured users that the team was actively working to address the fundamental problems and enhance the system&#8217;s stability. Gokal stressed the significance of taking lessons from these occurrences and putting them into practice to minimize similar disruptions in the future.</p>



<p>Analysts and investors have been paying attention to Solana despite the losses. According to InvestAnswers, a well-known provider of investing research, the value of SOL, the native cryptocurrency of Solana, should be at least three times higher than it is right now. The outfit attributed its projection to Solana&#8217;s technological breakthroughs and scaling possibilities.</p>



<p>Solana is determined to overcome its obstacles because it wants to be the next Apple in the cryptocurrency industry. The platform is now a real competitor for the crypto throne because of its solid technological capabilities and rising popularity. Even if recent outages have put Solana&#8217;s resilience to the test, the enterprise is steadfast in its resolve to resolve these problems and fulfil its commitments.</p>



<p>However, it first needs to address the serious concerns about network outages. All eyes will be on Solana as the cryptocurrency market develops to see if it can keep its speed and become the disruptive force it aims to be. Solana&#8217;s future will likely be shaped by the upcoming months, which will decide if it can maintain its position as a pioneer in the blockchain sector and possibly realize its goal of becoming the Apple of Crypto.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden announced in a May 28, 2023 Tweet that a budget agreement on raising the US debt limit had been reached in principle, and he strongly urged the House of Representatives and the Senate to pass the deal right away.</p>



<p>This follows days of uncertainty over when an agreement on the U.S. debt ceiling would be reached, raising fears of a potential debt default in early June.</p>



<p>On May 26, 2023, the Secretary of the Treasury, Janet L. Yellen, sent another letter to all members of Congressional leadership highlighting the risk that the Treasury would be unable to satisfy its obligations if Congress did not raise or suspend the debt limit before that time.</p>



<p>In a Tweet, Kevin McCarthy, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, also confirmed that a tentative agreement had been reached. Details of the debt ceiling agreement will be shared by McCarthy shortly.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-analysts-are-divided-over-the-impact-the-debt-ceiling-crisis-would-have-on-the-crypto-markets">Analysts are divided over the impact the debt ceiling crisis would have on the crypto markets</h2>



<p>Some analysts have argued that problems in the traditional finance market have tended to increase investor interest in cryptocurrency. Raising the debt ceiling would prompt more money printing and boost capital inflows into the crypto industry.</p>



<p>Other analysts are of the view that problems in the traditional finance market can prove bearish for crypto in the long term.</p>



<p>Still, some other analysts believe that a U.S. debt default could see stablecoins lose their investment appeal since some stablecoins hold reserves in short-term U.S. government bonds and cash (in U.S. dollars).</p>



<p>In the 24 hours preceding the debt ceiling tentative agreement, Bitcoin and Ether were trading under US$27,000 and US$1,840, respectively, according to CoinGecko data. In the 24 hours following the announcement of the tentative debt ceiling agreement, Bitcoin and Ether traded over US$ 27,000 and US$ 1,850, respectively.</p>



<p>In a statement, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce commended the tentative deal to prevent the debt Limit Crisis. The U.S. Chamber President and CEO, Suzanne P. Clark, said the U.S. is a step closer to averting an economic crisis.</p>



<p>The US Chamber of Commerce said that the agreement would see the U.S. confronting a future debt limit drama and lower the national debt. The Chamber of Commerce called for Republicans and Democrats to work together to secure the nation’s economic future and competitiveness.</p>



<p>The details of the debt ceiling agreement, its approval through Congress in the coming days, and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting scheduled for June 13-14 will likely provide further direction to the crypto and other financial markets.</p>

<li>Tokenization continues to garner steam as recent data reveal that the top six networks host over $200 million worth of tokenized assets.</li>



<li>Ethereum leads the pack among networks with firms like Ondo and MatrixDock holding 64% and 32% of the market share.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Experts praise innovation in the sector but lament the lack of regulatory clarity as the only obstacle in sight. </li>
</ul>



<p>Decentralized finance (DeFi) springs up new possibilities with tokenization as a way of issuing financial assets and securities including stocks and government-backed bonds on the blockchain.</p>



<p>A Dune report <a href="https://dune.com/steakhouse/tokenized-securities">shows</a> that tokenization on the blockchain now has tapped a $225 million market cap across the top six platforms. Leading DeFi blockchain, Ethereum boasts more activity as expected and is closely followed by Polygon and Gnosis Chain.</p>



<p>Firms like Ondo, Matrixport, Franklin Templeton, and Backed Finance have created ERC 20 tokens to represent stocks and government-backed bonds. Ondo and Matrixport dominate the scene with a market share of 64% and 32%, respectively focusing on short-term US bonds which are expected to yield about 5% due to interest hikes by the Federal Reserve.</p>



<p>As innovation grows, firms are seen to become more versatile in the industry. Last month, Franklin Templeton hosted a tokenized version of FOBXX, its own Nasdaq-listed US Fund on Polygon. Backed Finance tokenized bonds are currently being accepted as collateral across DeFi products, including Ribbon Finance and Angle.</p>



<p>Backed Finance has also rolled out a tokenized version of Coinbase stock on Ethereum alongside its ERC 20 version of over 400 companies in the S&amp;P 500. Ondo, on its part, adds value to its users through Flux, a lending service that lets users put up their ERC 20 tokens as collateral.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-future-of-tokenization-is-here">The future of tokenization is here</h2>



<p>Tokenization which leverages blockchain technology, is billed to grow massively in the coming months. Across the top six platforms, the sector has surged 17% in the last 30 days, with many saying it is “<em>the next generation of markets.”</em></p>



<p>BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink <a href="https://youtu.be/PSVpth7uqb4">noted</a> that tokenization leads to instant settlements, cheaper fees, and integration into its business model. Similarly, Kit Popplestone, Backed Finance Head of Marketing, noted that interoperability would unlock new opportunities and products, making lending more efficient.</p>



<p>With increased adoption comes sceptics who believe the lack of regulatory clarity may hinder the growth of tokenized securities. </p>



<p><em>“To continue this rapid growth, we need regulatory clarity and consistency, and just as importantly, tokens must be interoperable and composable with DeFi,” </em>Popplestone added.</p>

<p>Coinbase CEO has cautioned US policymakers against disregarding the importance of crypto beyond individual transactions, stating that doing so poses a threat to America&#8217;s longstanding position as a global financial leader and innovation hub.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/coinbase-ceo-americas-future-as-a-global-technology-leader-is-up-for-grabs-c3a9c6ae">opinion piece</a> published by Marketwatch Tuesday, Armstrong highlighted his efforts, along with other industry peers, in advocating for regulatory clarity to safeguard consumers and fully unleash the potential of cryptocurrencies. However, rather than implementing supportive regulations, he noted that the United States was experiencing the rise of enforcement actions and restrictive policies, forcing important players in the crypto sector to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-plans-to-move-offshore-due-to-severe-lack-of-clarity-from-sec-how-avorak-ai-helps-amid-these-developments/">migrate offshore</a>.</p>



<p><em>“By enforcing restrictive policies, the U.S. is inadvertently driving crypto-innovation offshore. That shift will compromise America’s legacy of pioneering technological advancements, and weaken our national security posture,” </em>said Armstrong.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The crypto executive went on to highlight the profound importance of cryptographic blockchains, stressing that they extend beyond financial services and serve as groundbreaking technologies with the potential to revolutionize various industries.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-china-could-topple-the-us"><strong>China Could Topple The US.</strong></h2>



<p>Armstrong further expressed fear over China toppling the US as the global financial leader, citing the failure to embrace innovation by the US. According to him, the continued deterioration of the US dollar as the global reserve currency was a direct result of policymakers ignoring change.</p>



<p>“<em>Currency has always embodied innovation”,</em> he said, noting that throughout history, the Currency has always embodied innovation, such as the transition from bartering to physical coins and portable paper currency to now cashless transactions.</p>



<p>In his view, while the US <a href="https://zycrypto.com/congress-house-committees-deliberate-on-innovation-and-regulation-of-digital-assets-in-the-u-s/">remains hesitant</a> about adopting blockchain technology, China has already made significant strides in this area. He particularly highlighted Chinese tech giants, including Alipay and Tencent, which have established integrated payment systems that offer immediate access to diverse services. Additionally, he noted that with the introduction of the digital yuan, China aims to directly challenge the longstanding dominance of the US dollar in global trade.</p>



<p><em>“Given these moves and China’s strategy to leverage financial technology to protect its own national interests, it should come as no surprise that Hong Kong is positioning itself as a&nbsp;global crypto hub,”</em> he said.</p>



<p>Additionally, Armstrong cautioned that China is not the only competitor in this race, as other established financial centres like the UK, United Arab Emirates, Brazil, Japan, the European Union, Australia, and Singapore are also actively working towards becoming cryptocurrency hubs.</p>



<p>That said, he urged policymakers to implement intelligent and customized regulations akin to the regulatory framework that shaped the internet age in the 1990s and early 2000s, stating that “<em>if we fall short today, the next generation of Americans will pay the price.”</em></p>

<p>The <a href="https://zycrypto.com/from-crypto-savior-to-being-up-against-the-ropes-how-it-turned-around-for-ftxs-sam-bankman-fried/">implosion of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX empire</a> is easily one of the most gruesome incidents in the crypto industry’s history. The FTX case underscores the risks of participating in the cryptocurrency market. In particular, it brings to the forefront the prevalence of counterparty risk in crypto.</p>



<p>The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, Binance, has come up with a potential solution to offset this risk, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-30/binance-may-let-some-clients-keep-trading-collateral-in-bank-accounts?srnd=cryptocurrencies-v2"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>. Binance wants to let select professional customers keep their trading collateral funds at a bank rather than on crypto platforms.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-binance-looks-to-eliminate-counterparty-risk"><strong>Binance Looks To Eliminate Counterparty Risk</strong></h2>



<p>Binance could soon move forward with a strategy to allow some of its traders to store their collateral in banks, thus eliminating counterparty risk.</p>



<p>For those unaware, counterparty risk is the measure of how likely one of the parties involved in a transaction is to default on their end of the bargain and how huge the damage is if they do.</p>



<p>Anonymous sources familiar with the matter told <em>Bloomberg </em>that Binance has engaged in talks with some institutional clients regarding the prospective plan that would enable them to employ bank deposits as collateral for margin trading.</p>



<p>Per the news publication, one possible arrangement would involve locking clients’ cash at a bank through a tri-party agreement while the exchange lends the customers stablecoins that would then serve as collateral for margin trading in both spot and derivatives markets. These collateral funds deposited in banks could be invested in money market funds, allowing clients to accumulate interest and offset the expense of borrowing crypto assets from Binance.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Binance Explores Collaboration With Banks</strong></h2>



<p>Two banks — Europe-based Bank Frick and FlowBank — have been floated in conversations about the project, although details of any potential partnership remain confidential. Moreover, Binance is yet to finalize the plan, and the arrangement is still subject to modification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nonetheless, the move comes as Binance and other crypto trading firms face immense pressure to guarantee safety in the event of unprecedented failure following the spectacular collapse of FTX last November, which brought about substantial permanent losses for institutional and retail traders.</p>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1mKwAxwAJ0&amp;t=2s&amp;ab_channel=Bankless">interview</a>, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao revealed that the exchange had briefly considered purchasing a bank and making it crypto-friendly, but ultimately decided against it due to strict regulations, the risks involved, and underwhelming profit expectations. Zhao noted:</p>



<p><em>“Banks are not cheap. Banks are very expensive for very little business revenue. […] The amount of capital required is quite high, and the regulatory approval for buying a bank is the same or more as setting up a new bank, which is very onerous If the banking regulators say, ‘Look, you can’t work with crypto’ then they can take your license away if you do. So buying a bank doesn’t prevent regulators from telling you, “No, you can’t touch crypto.” Even then, we would need corresponding banks all over the world.”</em></p>

<p>XRP holders’ counsel John E Deaton, known for his commentary on Ripple’s pending lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has predicted that FOMO will set in when the XRP price taps $2.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-deaton-is-mega-bullish-on-xrp-price"><strong>Deaton Is Mega Bullish On XRP Price</strong></h2>



<p>Looking to mainline the XRP community with a healthy dose of hopium is CryptoLaw founder John Deaton. Amid the plethora of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ex-ripple-exec-on-why-sec-might-still-defeat-ripple-in-xrp-lawsuit-amid-unmasking-of-hinman-docs/">bearish opinions</a> as the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit rages on, Deaton came out bullish as ever, highlighting XRP’s prospects.</p>



<p>He alluded that it is crazy to think that many people will not buy XRP at its current $0.48 price tag. However, he is confident that these same people will buy the token when it will be worth over $1. Even more interesting is that Deaton expects many investors to FOMO into XRP once its price surges above the impressive $2 mark.</p>



<p>There’s an old saying on Wall Street that financial markets are propelled by two emotions, fear and greed. In the cryptocurrency markets, the driver is usually a combination of the two: fear of missing out ( FOMO).</p>



<p>XRP is trading 1.3% higher intraday, pushing the sixth-largest cryptocurrency’s market cap beyond $25 billion. Currently trading hands at $0.499, XRP has every reason to reclaim the $2 level as the crypto traded at a historical high of around $3.40 over five years ago, as per CoinGecko.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>XRP Gearing Up For A Comeback</strong></h2>



<p>Most pundits in the crypto market who have closely followed the price performance of XRP in recent years have noted that the legal battle between Ripple and the SEC has caused considerable damage to the token.</p>



<p>Part of the lawsuit has centered around whether Ripple sold XRP tokens as unregistered securities. Most prospective investors and Ripple partners have stayed on the sidelines since the lawsuit was <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">initiated </a>in December 2020 amid regulatory confusion in the United States. This has greatly affected the price of XRP over the years.</p>



<p>The current consensus in the crypto community is that XRP will soon recoup all its losses and dart higher after the lawsuit reaches its conclusion.</p>

<ul>
<li>Dan Berkovitz, a former CFTC Commissioner, says Ethereum lies within the regulatory purview of both the SEC and the CFTC as the debate grows.&nbsp;</li>



<li>He asserts that digital assets can be categorized as a security and a commodity because of the existing legal framework. </li>



<li>Crypto executives and users continue to criticise the SEC, calling their regulatory approach “<em>stifling” </em>and harsh. </li>
</ul>



<p>The debate on the agency with regulatory powers over Ethereum (ETH) in the United States continues with a former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Commissioner dividing the cake into two halves.</p>



<p>Dan Berkovitz, a former CFTC  Commissioner and ex-general counsel to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has stated that ETH can be categorized as a commodity as well as a security based on the details of specific transactions.</p>



<p>Speaking on the Unchained podcast, he claims the digital asset is under the jurisdiction of both Federal agencies suggesting that synergy may be required to effectively regulate digital assets.</p>



<p>“<em>The law is clear. Something can be both a commodity and a security,” </em>he said.</p>



<p>Throwing more light on the topic, Berkovitz noted that ETH not being a physical commodity like “<em>wheat” and “oat” </em>is the genesis of the confusion because anything that is under a “<em>futures contract” </em>can be grouped as a commodity. He explained further that the word “futures” is part of the CFTC’s jurisdiction.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the Securities Act defined securities to include investment contracts stretching it to a “futures contract.” He concluded that since the SEC regulates securities and the CFTC jurisdiction covers futures trading and swaps, both agencies can regulate ETH. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sec-receives-knocks-maintains-position"><strong>SEC receives knocks, maintains position</strong></h2>



<p>The last six months have <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ethereum-and-stablecoins-are-commodities-cftc-clashes-with-the-sec/">revealed</a> regulatory confusion in the digital asset market with both the CFTC and the SEC making contradictory claims. The CFTC has called Ethereum alongside other cryptocurrencies commodities.</p>



<p>Gary Gensler-led SEC has stated that cryptocurrencies, except Bitcoin, should be categorized as securities. Gensler’s view has been criticized from all quarters, including in Congress, but the once pro-crypto administrator remains firm on his position.</p>



<p>Criticizing the SEC, Collin Lloyd a partner at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell said at the podcast that no case law suggests ETH on the blockchain can natively be a Security rather, the question should be if it was part of a Security transaction.</p>



<p><em>”It’s kind of a weird question to be asking, ‘Is this digital asset a security or not?’ I think you should be asking, ‘Is this digital asset being sold as part of a securities transaction?’ That depends on the facts and circumstances,” </em>he added.</p>

<p>In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin remains the leading digital asset, captivating the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike. Amidst market uncertainties, a recent report by IntotTheBlock sheds light on an intriguing trend. The report highlights the growing conviction of long-term Bitcoin holders as the total amount of Bitcoin they hold approaches an all-time high, surpassing previous levels recorded in March. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-resilience-of-long-term-holders-during-market-uncertainty"><strong>The Resilience of Long-Term Holders During Market Uncertainty</strong></h2>



<p>Despite the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market, long-term Bitcoin holders have consistently demonstrated their unwavering belief in the asset&#8217;s potential. Their conviction is showcased by the increasing accumulation of Bitcoin, as indicated by the rising <a href="https://zycrypto.com/retail-investors-bitcoin-ownership-hits-all-time-high-with-17-of-total-supply/">total amount held</a>. This trend reflects a strong commitment to the digital currency, even in the face of market uncertainty and short-term price fluctuations.</p>



<p>Market uncertainties often serve as a litmus test for the resolve of long-term holders. Various factors influence Bitcoin&#8217;s price movements, including macroeconomic events, regulatory developments, and market sentiment. During periods of turbulence, short-term traders may be tempted to sell their holdings, driven by fear or a desire to secure quick profits. In contrast, long-term holders exhibit resilience, viewing market fluctuations as an opportunity to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/why-michael-novogratz-advises-buying-bitcoin-amid-market-uncertainty/">strengthen</a> their positions and reap the rewards in the long run.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Significance of Accumulation &#8211; Sign of Future Growth?</strong></h2>



<p>The accumulation of Bitcoin by long-term holders carries several implications. Firstly, it reflects a long-term investment strategy, where holders believe in the asset&#8217;s potential for substantial future growth. This confidence is often grounded in understanding Bitcoin&#8217;s scarcity, its position as a store of value, and its increasing adoption across various industries.</p>



<p>Secondly, the growing accumulation by long-term holders reduces the available supply of Bitcoin in circulation, potentially exerting upward pressure on its price. As the scarcity of an asset increases, its perceived value rises, attracting new investors and further bolstering the market.</p>



<p>The conviction and accumulation of Bitcoin by long-term holders set the stage for the asset&#8217;s continued <a href="https://zycrypto.com/another-bitcoin-indicator-hints-at-explosive-btc-price-growth/">growth</a>. Their belief in the transformative power of Bitcoin as a decentralized digital currency is a testament to its potential to disrupt traditional financial systems.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the increasing adoption of Bitcoin by institutional investors and corporations adds credibility and stability to the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This institutional interest aligns with the long-term vision of Bitcoin and paves the way for broader acceptance and integration within mainstream financial markets.</p>



<p>The recent surge in the total amount of Bitcoin held by long-term holders showcases their <a href="https://zycrypto.com/microstrategy-doubles-down-on-bitcoin-vows-to-keep-accumulating-btc-despite-market-volatility/">unwavering conviction</a> in the asset&#8217;s potential. As market uncertainties persist, these holders stand strong, accumulating Bitcoin and setting the stage for further growth. This development highlights the enduring appeal of Bitcoin as a long-term investment and underscores its role as a cornerstone of the evolving digital economy. With increasing institutional adoption and growing global recognition, Bitcoin&#8217;s journey towards mainstream acceptance seems more promising than ever before.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ordinals is drawing top talents across web3, including ETH developers, to build on the Bitcoin Network.</li>



<li>OrdinalSafe, a wallet designed for Bitcoin Ordinals, emerged in second place in Bitcoin 2023’s pitch day event.</li>



<li>The great Ordinal debate takes center stage as some BTC maxis continue to oppose the development of Ordinals, citing security concerns. </li>
</ul>



<p>The buzz around Bitcoin Ordinals continues to grow, with inscriptions surpassing 9 million barely six months after its launch, drawing the attention of top investors.</p>



<p>The Bitcoin Conference 2023 held last week in Miami left memorable experiences and introduced investors to new products around the Bitcoin Network. Notable attendees included Ethereum developers who are glued to Bitcoin in recent weeks thanks to Ordinals.</p>



<p>Developers drawn by the wave of experimentation and innovation participated in an infrastructural pitch category with OrdinalSafe, a wallet created for Ordinals emerging second place. Asad Yusuf Atik OrdinalSafe’s CEO, lauded the remarkable event as a boost for young developers.</p>



<p>“<em>It&#8217;s your first time on that stage, and you&#8217;re trying to sell the vision of your product to other people, so you want to do a good job. I was nervous, but going to the stage for the prize, it felt great,” </em>he added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 22-year-old developer first broke into the scene in 2020 after his team created a Proof of Innocence protocol. The product was built for Ethereum’s coin mixer Tornado Cash and helped users prove that they did not use a sanctioned address to carry out transactions.</p>



<p>Atik explained that he learned about Ordinals on Twitter in February and got attracted by the buzz around it alongside other Ethereum developers.</p>



<p><em>“Even though we came from an Ethereum background, it felt like home,” Atik said. “If you&#8217;re developing on Bitcoin, you&#8217;re part of the community, right?”</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-btc-community-moves-with-ordinals"><strong>BTC community moves with Ordinals</strong></h2>



<p>Bitcoin Ordinals have come with positives for the network, but it has also sparked controversy in community spaces. While igniting bulls in anticipation of a run temporarily pushing BTC above $28,000, Ordinals also led to the congestion of the network, driving up transaction fees.</p>



<p>Ordinals hit 3 million inscriptions shooting up Bitcoin’s daily transaction <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-weekly-transactions-hit-new-high-as-ordinals-mint-goes-past-2-5-million-sets-new-record/">volume</a> to an all-time high, leading to congestion of the mempool. Transaction fees got so high, causing users to pay a “<em>premium” </em>on it. The situation got more complex with the world’s leading digital asset exchange Binance halting BTC withdrawals twice due to the surge in transactions.</p>



<p>Currently, a vast majority of BTC faithful have backed Ordinals despite dissenting voices claiming it poses a security threat to the network. MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor expressed his support for Ordinals, noting the key role it can play in the mass adoption of the asset.</p>
