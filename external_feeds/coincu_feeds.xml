<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The FBI raided former FTX CEO Ryan Salame&#8217;s Potomac, Maryland home.</em></li>



<li><em>There is presently no information available on what the FBI was looking for at Salame&#8217;s $4 million property.</em></li>



<li><em>Salame was the co-CEO of FTX Digital Markets, the affiliate in the Bahamas.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The residence of former FTX co-CEO Ryan Salame has allegedly been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/27/technology/ftx-ryan-salame-sam-bankman-fried.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">examined</a> by the FBI as the executive faces more investigation for his close advising position to Sam Bankman-Fried.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1958.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1958-1024x683.png" alt="Former FTX Exec&#039;s $4 Million House Searched By FBI: Report" class="wp-image-184538" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1958-1024x683.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1958-300x200.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1958-768x512.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1958-750x500.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1958-1140x760.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1958.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Former FTX Exec&#039;s $4 Million House Searched By FBI: Report 2"></a></figure></div>


<p>According to a story in <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/27/technology/ftx-ryan-salame-sam-bankman-fried.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Times</a></em> on April 27, citing sources familiar with the situation, the Bureau searched Salame&#8217;s $4 million house in Potomac, Maryland, on the morning of April 27.</p>



<p>There is presently no information available on what the FBI was hoping to discover at Salame&#8217;s residence. It is still unknown what the authorities were searching for. Salame was the co-CEO of FTX Digital Markets, FTX&#8217;s affiliate in the Bahamas. He also worked at Alameda Research and, together with Gary Wang and Caroline Ellison, became a part of Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s inner circle.</p>



<p>Authorities are investigating Salame&#8217;s $24 million in political contributions during last year&#8217;s midterm elections, alleging that the bulk of the overall $90 million contributed by ex-FTX employees—including to Republican Congressman George Santos&#8217; campaign—was stolen from customer money.</p>



<p>Salame was the fourth-largest receiver of these payments, receiving $87 million in total compensation. Former engineering director Nishad Singh and co-founder Gary Wang got $587 million and $246 million, respectively, from Bankman-Fried.</p>



<p>FTX&#8217;s new management, led by attorney and bankruptcy specialist John Ray III, stated at the time that it would be further investigating its rights to pursue potential legal action against the recipients and their subsequent transferees and that ongoing efforts would result in the identification of additional assets, liabilities, and transfers.</p>



<p>Prosecutors believe that Bankman-Fried recruited personnel, including Salame, who joined the business in 2021, to serve as proxies for his company and give tens of millions of dollars to both Republican and Democratic politicians.</p>



<p>The raid comes amid a long-running federal probe into the exchange&#8217;s collapse, which occurred in a spectacular manner last November. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has been charged by US authorities, and a number of FTX insiders have all agreed to cooperate as the case progresses toward a formal trial. FTX was valued at $32 billion before its demise. On many counts of money laundering, conspiracy, and wire fraud, Bankman-Fried risks life in prison.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The Magic Eden AMM pool has been launched, enabling users to operate as buyer LPs, seller LPs, and double-sided LPs.</em></li>



<li><em>Maker fees are now zero, and all liquidity pools have a fee multiplier of 1.3x.</em></li>



<li><em>Fee multipliers will be distributed to liquidity pool providers.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>NFT marketplace Magic Eden announced the launch of the Magic Eden AMM pool, allowing users to act as buyer LPs, seller LPs, and double-sided LPs.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1955.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="600" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1955-1024x600.png" alt="Magic Eden AMM Launched With 0 Attractive Maker Fee" class="wp-image-184534" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1955-1024x600.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1955-300x176.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1955-768x450.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1955-1536x900.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1955-750x439.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1955-1140x668.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1955.png 1649w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Magic Eden AMM Launched With 0 Attractive Maker Fee 5"></a></figure></div>


<p>Currently, Maker fees are 0 (until further notice), and all liquidity pools have a 1.3x fee multiplier ($50,000 prize pool). All fee multipliers will be sent to liquidity pool providers.</p>



<p>Users can handle a single-item sell or purchase order, but maintaining multi-item sale or buy orders (LPs) may soon become burdensome. Magic Eden&#8217;s AMM makes it simple to handle sell-side, buy-side, and double-sided LPs of any size.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1956.png"><img decoding="async" width="504" height="558" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1956.png" alt="Magic Eden AMM Launched With 0 Attractive Maker Fee" class="wp-image-184535" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1956.png 504w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1956-271x300.png 271w" sizes="(max-width: 504px) 100vw, 504px" title="Magic Eden AMM Launched With 0 Attractive Maker Fee 6"></a></figure></div>


<p>There were two kinds of LPs: buy-side LPs and sell-side LPs.</p>



<p>A buy-side LP is comparable to numerous collection offerings with varying pricing. Instead of entering prices one by one, describe your complete buy-side LP in words such as pricing curve type, the highest purchase price on the curve, number of single buy orders on the curve, incremental delta amount on the curve, and royalty-payment enabled.</p>



<p>A sell-side LP is analogous to several listings with varying pricing. Instead of entering prices one by one, just define the complete sell-side LP in words such as pricing curve type, lowest sell price on the curve, set of NFTs that must be included in the sell-side LP, incremental delta amount on the curve, and royalty payment necessary on each sale.</p>



<p>There is also a double-sided LP is one that has a buy-side and a sell-side. It functions similarly to a standard market maker in that users may trade both sides of the market. A double-sided LP&#8217;s author may establish an LP-Fee to collect fees as a percentage of each purchase or sell transaction using the LP. This implies that LP owners will be able to collect fees on all LP transactions.</p>



<p>Magic Eden AMM Pools make it easy to handle sell-side, buy-side, and double-sided LPs on Magic Eden. Users can quickly make, edit, and cancel orders with the right technology, regardless of how big their LP is.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>FTX Japan is planning to restart the exchange after reopening withdrawals for users.</em></li>



<li><em>The resale plan may be delayed despite being watched by many investors.</em></li>



<li><em>Adhering to the strict rules the Financial Services Agency set forth and following Japanese laws on separate asset management helped the Japanese branch escape the vortex of FTX.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>FTX Japan is said to be postponing a resale plan to launch its crypto exchange after reopening withdrawals for customers.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1953.png"><img decoding="async" width="560" height="294" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1953.png" alt="FTX Japan Delays Resale To Restart Exchange" class="wp-image-184523" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1953.png 560w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1953-300x158.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" title="FTX Japan Delays Resale To Restart Exchange 9"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Shareholders say FTX&#8217;s Japan branch plans to restart the Japanese exchange. Despite bidding interest, sales plans have been halted to maximize value. This seems possible because while most global companies associated with FTX were caught up in its debacle, only the Japanese branch was relatively unscathed and made it through a plan to reopen customer withdrawals. Besides reopening the exchange, FTX Japan may set up a custodian company that will handle all client funds separately from the exchange.</p>

<p>FTX Japan recently allowed customers to <a href="https://news.coincu.com/180228-ftx-japan-is-hoping-to-reopen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">withdraw money</a> and electronic assets starting from February 21 local time. On February 16, the exchange sent an email asking affected users to check their balances in preparation for the transfer of assets. CEO Melamed is confident of meeting the schedule and will announce the resumption of withdrawals after receiving sufficient data and related approvals for the balance transfer.</p>



<p>FTX Japan was originally a Japanese Liquid cryptocurrency exchange, and acquired by FTX in 2022. Following the bankruptcy of FTX, the Japanese branch said that Japanese customer assets will not be involved in bankruptcy proceedings in the United States &#8220;with consideration of deposit and custody sign these assets and property rights in accordance with Japanese law.&#8221;</p>

<p>According to documents published on December 26, 2022, FTX Japan manages an excess of customer deposits for all 14 cryptocurrencies it handles, including Bitcoin and ETH. In addition, the company operated a legal currency balance of about 6.3 billion yen, exceeding customer deposits by approximately 300 million yen.</p>



<p>FTX Japan adheres to strict rules set forth by the Financial Services Agency and is subject to Japanese legislation regarding separate asset management. The agency has managed to mitigate the impact of the FTX Global bankruptcy and take steps towards a smooth refund process for customers.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>US Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler delivered an essential message about cryptocurrencies in a newly released video.</em></li>



<li><em>He again emphasized that cryptocurrency trading platforms must be registered with the this agency</em>.</li>



<li><em>Gensler warns investors that many current crypto platforms are operating in violation of securities laws.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The president of the US securities regulator, Gary Gensler</strong>, <strong>has taken another blow to the crypto industry who has stated that many crypto platforms are operating in violation of securities laws.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1950.png"><img decoding="async" width="931" height="523" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1950.png" alt="Gary Gensler Warns Cryptocurrency Platforms Must Be Registered With SEC" class="wp-image-184514" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1950.png 931w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1950-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1950-768x431.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1950-750x421.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 931px) 100vw, 931px" title="Gary Gensler Warns Cryptocurrency Platforms Must Be Registered With SEC 13"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In an April 27 tweet, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler shared a <a href="https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1651624244445421591" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">4-minute video </a>of him describing the crypto asset as an &#8220;investment contract&#8221; before the announcement urges platforms offering such products to register with the SEC to protect US investors.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Instead, many crypto platforms are contending that their investment contracts are something else. The law cares about what something is, not what you call it.&#8221;</p>
<cite>He said.</cite></blockquote>



<p>The SEC has been at the forefront of the US crypto crackdown, with Gensler repeatedly asserting that essentially all crypto assets &#8211; except Bitcoin (BTC). In Gensler&#8217;s view, many crypto companies and platforms violate securities laws if they don&#8217;t register with the this agency.</p>



<p>However, this is contrary to the assertions before he assumed the current position. This was widely shared in a video from 2018. He stated that three-quarters of the crypto market is commodities, &#8220;not securities&#8221;.</p>



<p>The above information may put Gensler in a more disadvantageous situation. Two weeks ago, Congressman Warren Davidson proposed a bill that would require the dismissal of Gary Gensler for disagreeing with his policies to regulate the crypto industry. Hester Peirce &#8211; SEC Commissioner, also supported Davidson and accused Gensler of destroying the potential of new technologies. In addition, at a House hearing on the evening of April 19, many members criticized Chairman Gary Gensler for his approach to the field of cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>Currently, the SEC and Coinbase are also having a <a href="https://news.coincu.com/184504-coinbase-responds-to-secs-wells-notice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fierce legal battle</a> when Coinbase has filed a lawsuit against the this agency for ignoring the questions that the exchange has raised to the committee since July 2022. At the time, Coinbase asked the SEC to answer 50 questions and answers about establishing a complete regulatory framework for the crypto industry, but accused the exchange of listing unregistered securities.</p>

<p>Coinbase is currently facing regulatory issues with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC has issued a Wells notice against the exchange, which is a notification that enforcement actions may be taken against the firm.</p>



<p>To appeal the notification, Coinbase&#8217;s executives spoke publicly about the issue. Chief legal officer Paul Grewal spoke at Consensus 2023 and appeared on YouTube in a video with CEO Brian Armstrong. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="jeg_video_container jeg_video_content"><iframe title="Coinbase responds to the SEC’s Wells notice | Excerpt" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pvbWPUCFdKA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Grewal stated that Coinbase has been operating within the regulatory perimeter since it was approved for listing on the Nasdaq stock exchange two years ago. This suggests that the exchange has been operating within the regulatory perimeter and that any regulatory concerns arise from a lack of clarity or interpretation of relevant laws.</p>



<p>Grewal also stated that Coinbase is already regulated and has a New York state &#8220;BitLicense&#8221; that prohibits the exchange from listing securities. He believes that legislation or rulemaking is needed if the SEC wants to expand its oversight over the industry.</p>



<p>Armstrong reiterated that Coinbase is committed to working within the regulatory perimeter and thoroughly vets its offerings. The company does not list securities and rejects &#8220;some 90%&#8221; of the assets it reviews. Despite the regulatory concerns, the firm is still prepared to go to court to defend its position. However, it believes it does not have to come to that and welcomes an actual dialog about a workable path forward for the cryptocurrency industry.</p>



<p>According to Paul Grewal, Coinbase has been in talks with the SEC about its business for many years, including sharing its legal views on its asset listing and staking services. </p>

<p>Polygon zkEVM Mainnet Beta has been experiencing tremendous growth in April. According to Polygon Labs, total users, contracts deployed, and total value locked (TVL) have all experienced +300% growth. Compared to Ethereum Mainnet, the average daily gas is 7X cheaper on Polygon zkEVM Mainnet Beta. This is great news for users who can benefit from the cost savings.</p>



<p>The number of unique active wallet addresses on Polygon zkEVM Mainnet Beta has almost tripled, with nearly 50k users as of April 24. Transactions continue to grow at a similar pace, with the total number of transactions increasing by +300% since the start of the month. The number of successful transactions is 168k as of April 24, generating 95.25 ETH (approximately $177K) in fees.</p>

<p>Insight into developer activity also shows robust growth. The number of contracts deployed on-chain has nearly doubled, from 540 at the start of the month to more than 1,000.</p>



<p>While TVL is a popular metric, Polygon Labs notes that it isn&#8217;t complete as it is commonly measured in USD, and so it reflects movement in the price of ETH as much as it reflects the day-to-day growth (or shrinkage) of a protocol. </p>

<p>For the purposes of this update, Polygon Labs uses net value bridged (NVB) to describe a larger number referring to all the assets that have been bridged to the network minus those assets that have been bridged back to Ethereum Mainnet. As of April 24, TVB is approximately $8.5M, for a Δ of ~$3.4M.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>An unidentified individual or group raised the alert, naming roughly 1,000 Bitcoin addresses that they allege belong to Russian intelligence organizations.</li>



<li>External parties have previously recognized at least three of the alleged Russian wallet addresses as belonging to Russia, giving credibility to the mystery Bitcoiner&#8217;s claims.</li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to crypto monitoring company Chainalysis, a clandestine Bitcoin enthusiast seems to have turned the tables on the Russian state by unmasking hundreds of wallets presumably controlled by security organizations.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1946.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1946-1024x682.png" alt="Russian Bitcoin Wallet Linked To Security Agencies Leaked Amid Tension Conflict" class="wp-image-184501" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1946-1024x682.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1946-300x200.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1946-768x511.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1946-750x499.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1946-1140x759.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1946.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Russian Bitcoin Wallet Linked To Security Agencies Leaked Amid Tension Conflict 26"></a></figure></div>


<p>The unknown individual used a feature in the Bitcoin blockchain&#8217;s transaction documentation to identify 986 wallets controlled by the Foreign Military Intelligence Agency (GRU), Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), and Federal Security Service (FSB), according to Chainalysis, a company that works closely with the US government. The vigilante&#8217;s messages, written in Russian, accuse the wallets of being engaged in hacking operations.</p>



<p>The authenticity of the individual&#8217;s statements is yet unknown, and the three organizations have yet to reply to the news. If the claims are accurate, it is clear that the individual gained access to at least some of the addresses they allege are possessed by Russia, either via hacking or even an inside operation.</p>



<p>These charges, made in the weeks preceding Russia&#8217;s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, provided an unexpected crypto edge to a war already filled with interesting occurrences. The Ukrainian government has used cryptocurrencies to raise tens of millions of dollars for military purposes. Curiously, according to Chainalysis, some of the wallets ostensibly owned by Russia have already remitted payments to Ukraine.</p>



<p>Chainalysis reports that at least three of the reported Russian wallet addresses had already been identified with Russia by external parties, lending legitimacy to the mystery Bitcoiner&#8217;s assertions. Two of these wallets were allegedly engaged in the SolarWinds assault, while another supported servers used in Russia&#8217;s misinformation effort during the 2016 election.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1947-1024x683.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1947-1024x683.png" alt="Russian Bitcoin Wallet Linked To Security Agencies Leaked Amid Tension Conflict" class="wp-image-184502" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1947-1024x683.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1947-300x200.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1947-768x512.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1947-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1947-2048x1365.png 2048w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1947-750x500.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1947-1140x760.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Russian Bitcoin Wallet Linked To Security Agencies Leaked Amid Tension Conflict 27"></a></figure></div>


<p>According to Chainalysis, the mystery Bitcoiner&#8217;s spending habits add credence to their assertions. The person essentially destroyed almost $300,000 in Bitcoin while recording their claims on the blockchain, which is much more than is necessary for using the Bitcoin network&#8217;s OP RETURN field.</p>



<p>In a report, Chainalysis <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/russia-bitcoin-op-return-messages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">noted</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“The fact that the OP_RETURN sender was both willing and able to burn hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of Bitcoin in order to spread their message makes it more likely in our opinion that their information is accurate.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The sender ceased producing the inscriptions when Russia invaded Ukraine. They thereafter restarted their operations by delivering Bitcoin related to Russia to Ukrainian charity accounts.</p>



<p>If the claims are genuine, the addresses and any Bitcoin they contain are effectively compromised from a security standpoint, as Chainalysis pointed out. The possibility that the OP RETURN sender gained private keys for Russian-controlled addresses casts doubt on the security of the Putin regime&#8217;s crypto activities.</p>

<p>The regulatory environment for crypto in the U.S. is causing some companies to move offshore to avoid regulatory compliance. This move has not gone unnoticed by Gary Gensler, the Securities and Exchange Commission chair, who believes that crypto markets suffer from a lack of regulatory compliance, not regulatory clarity.</p>



<p>In a new pet-themed video on Twitter, Gensler compared the compliance conundrum of crypto to calling a dog a goldfish in order to skirt leash laws. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Intermediaries for investment contracts are required to comply with securities laws &amp; register with <a href="https://twitter.com/SECGov?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@SECGov</a>.<br><br>Instead, many crypto platforms are contending that their investment contracts are something else.<br><br>The law cares about what something actually is, not what you call it.</p>&mdash; Gary Gensler (@GaryGensler) <a href="https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1651624244445421591?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">April 27, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>He stated that it doesn&#8217;t matter if a company calls itself onshore or offshore; it must comply with American laws if it makes securities available to American investors.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“In many places around the country, we’re required to use a leash when you walk your dog. But let&#8217;s just say you get stopped because you&#8217;re walking Rover unleashed. What do you think would happen if you told the police officer that, Rover is actually a goldfish? You&#8217;d still get a citation. And that&#8217;s because the law cares about what something actually is, not what you call it.”</p>
<cite>Gensler said</cite></blockquote>



<p>Gensler&#8217;s comments come amid a tussle between the crypto industry and the SEC regarding regulating cryptocurrencies. Coinbase, one of the most vocal companies in this space, recently sued the agency.</p>



<p>Gensler&#8217;s stance is that many crypto platforms are pretending that the investment contracts they offer are more like goldfish, and the lack of compliance by these platforms means that basic investor protections are not in place.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Many crypto platforms are just pretending that these investment contracts that they offer are more like goldfish, and the lack of compliance by these crypto platforms means that you don’t have basic investor protections.”</p>



<p>“It doesn&#8217;t matter if you call yourself onshore or offshore. If you make securities available to American investors, you must comply with American laws.”  “The law is clear.”</p>
<cite>Gensler continued</cite></blockquote>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>According to PancakeSwap DAO, 70% of the CAKE-holding community voted in favor of curbing inflation and lowering block rewards.</em></li>



<li><em>The DAO proposes reducing the number of tokens stakeholders get as interest for storing their coins.</em></li>



<li><em>The PancakeSwap community opted for an &#8220;aggressive reduction&#8221; in staking incentives this week, causing the CAKE token to fall in value.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>A community <a href="https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/0x707643dd2c2b941c7274f26a0362922198912e8549050ae9f2d1d9d71ada04bb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vote</a> to reduce CAKE block rewards emitted by the decentralized-finance protocol PancakeSwap is nearing completion, with nearly 70% of votes of the decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, in favor of an “aggressive reduction.” The vote will end at 15:30 UTC on Friday.</p>



<p>CAKE emissions on PancakeSwap’s main liquidity pool would drop by 94% once the proposal is voted in. Core developers published a proposal to this effect, and voting kicked off earlier this week, although members of the protocols DAO started debating the proposal in early April. The proposal aims to cut down CAKE’s interest to around 3-5%. The current rate above 20% was deemed “unsustainable” by some community members.</p>



<p>The team behind PancakeSwap carefully considered the dialogue surrounding the unsustainable inflation rate of CAKE that required the token to see higher adoption and capital inflow for stakers to earn higher yields. A proposal to aggressively reduce inflation and transform CAKE’s tokenomics to generate higher real yield and favor long-term CAKE stakers was put forward.</p>



<p>To achieve this, the core team will change CAKE emissions from 6.65 CAKE per block to 3 CAKE per block if the proposal is voted for. 70% of community members already voted in favor of this “aggressive reduction.” Emissions refer to the rate new crypto coins are released or added to the total supply.</p>



<p>The first emission reduction will be immediate. Afterward, developers will slash token emissions by 0.5 CAKE per month. This reduction will happen every month for five months till emissions occur at a 0.35 CAKE per month rate.</p>



<p>At press time, 69.33% of voters were in favor of the proposal, 10.41% agreed to a gradual and not aggressive reduction in inflation, and 20.26% rejected both models.</p>

<p>On the weekly chart, PancakeSwap’s native asset CAKE declined by over 20%. The dip in CAKE’s price coincides with an exodus of staked tokens and a community vote to tweak tokenomics.</p>

<p>Google Cloud will add support for Polygon to its Blockchain Node Engine, which currently only supports Ethereum and Solana. Google Cloud will also build infrastructure to support Polygon zkEVM, a new blockchain within the Polygon ecosystem. By the end of Q3, Google Cloud will help developers deploy application-specific blockchains built with Polygon tech on its servers.</p>

<p class="has-small-font-size">The industry is experiencing a flight to quality as corporations seek to minimize risk when exploring new possibilities in Web3.</p>
<cite>Mitesh Agarwal, a managing director at Google Cloud, said in a statement</cite></blockquote>



<p>As part of its extensive partnership with Polygon Labs, Google Cloud has announced a range of benefits for Polygon Ventures, including hosting credits on its servers and access to its Web3 startup program. Polygon developers will also receive similar benefits, while Google Cloud will tailor its infrastructure to suit Polygon’s ecosystem. Polygon’s impressive list of clients, which includes Starbucks and Mastercard, demonstrates its growing importance in the industry.</p>



<p>This partnership represents a significant expansion of Google Cloud&#8217;s engagement with blockchain protocols. It goes beyond the level of support provided to Celo developers under the existing Google for Startups Cloud Program. Despite the current regulatory climate and market conditions, Google Cloud&#8217;s increased focus on Web3 is clear. </p>



<p>In the first half of 2022, it created digital assets and Web3 engineering teams and has since partnered with several labs and foundations to support a range of blockchains, including BNB Chain, Solana, Aptos, Tezos, Casper, and Celo.</p>



<p>The partnership with Polygon will help onboard more people into Web3 and minimize risk when exploring new possibilities in the industry.</p>
