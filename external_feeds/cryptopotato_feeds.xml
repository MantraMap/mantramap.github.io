			            <description><![CDATA[The extent of digital asset usage in the deal has not been disclosed.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>American entertainment and record label conglomerate &#8211; Warner Music Group &#8211; is continuing to expand its metaverse strategy, evident in its latest partnership and investment in DressX, a digital fashion retailer.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Warner Music artists will be able to collaborate directly with DressX to design and launch 3D and AR virtual clothing, which can be collected and accessed by fans across various social media channels such as Instagram, Snapchat, and other platforms partners.</p>
<h2>Warner Music Group Metaverse Push</h2>
<p>According to the official blog <a href="https://www.wmg.com/news/warner-music-group-announces-partnership-with-and-investment-in-leading-digital-fashion-company-dressx" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">post</a>, artists will also be able to leverage additional revenue streams through the partnership while simultaneously creating new outlets for fans to exhibit their fandom across multiple digital worlds.</p>
<p>In a statement, Oana Ruxandra, WMG&#8217;s Chief Digital Officer &amp; EVP of Business Development, said,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The representation of our future digital selves will be as important and, if you’re measuring by the sheer volume of interactions, maybe more important than how we represent ourselves physically. As our digital identities become exponentially more robust and impactful, we are focused on building partnerships that will enable WMG and our artists.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Warner Music Group has not revealed the amount invested in DressX as a part of the agreement.</p>
<p>Earlier this summer, DressX had partnered with Meta (formerly Facebook) and began selling outfits in the Mark Zuckerbereg-led company&#8217;s Avatar Store. This marked the first time a digital-native fashion company got the opportunity to be invited by the social media giant alongside prominent luxury labels &#8211; Prada, Balenciaga, and Thom Browne.</p>
<h2>Web3 Push</h2>
<p>The music and entertainment conglomerate partnered with Animoca Brands&#8217; The Sandbox to launch a music-themed virtual world in January this year. This was Warner Music Group&#8217;s first venture in the Web3 space, as part of which the company <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/the-sandbox-partners-with-warner-for-musical-metaverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">acquired</a> &#8220;ESTATE.&#8221;</p>
<p>For context, the &#8220;ESTATE&#8221; was described as a hybrid of a musical theme park and concert venue that will act as a portal for Warner&#8217;s artists to make an appearance in the metaverse.</p>
<p>A month later, Warner dived into record label company dived into blockchain gaming by <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/global-music-mogul-warner-music-group-partners-with-splinterlands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">partnering</a> with a developer, Splinterlands. The deal was to develop mobile-friendly, accessible games by moving towards arcade-style gaming in a bid to further advance the adoption and bolster community building more seamlessly than the conventional play-to-earn (P2E) games.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Trump’s “major announcement” appears to have attracted an audience of hungry buyers.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite his seemingly poor market timing, former U.S. President Donald Trump’s recently launched collection of digital “baseball cards” sold out within 24 hours of their release. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The crypto community has reacted with amusement – especially given Trump’s prior statements berating crypto as a “scam.”</span></p>
<h2>Trump Has an NFT Collection?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As CryptoPotato </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/donald-trump-announces-personal-nft-collection/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> on Thursday, Trump’s NFTs – or “cards” – portray art representing parts of his life and career. The collectibles featured him in various outfits and places, ranging from cowboy getup, to an astronaut suit, to a racecar driver. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Trump Digital Trading Cards (NFTs) are intended as collectible items for individual enjoyment only, not for investment vehicles,” clarified the investment page.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The collection featured 2,533 NFTs in total sold for $99 each – meaning the sale raised over $250,000. Each NFT purchased entered buyers into sweepstakes with a chance to win various prizes, including a 20-minute meeting with Trump, a zoom call, a golf game, or an autograph signed by the celebrity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, buyers of 45 separate NFTs earned a guaranteed ticket to a 2000-person Gala dinner with the former president. Each NFT could beat bought with cash, ETH, or WETH. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Melania Trump </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/melania-trump-launches-an-nft-and-blockchain-venture-based-on-solana/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> her own Solana-based NFT collection exactly one year ago today. Proceeds were used to raise money for foster children’s education.</span></p>
<h2>Trump’s Crypto Flip Flop?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Trump has repeatedly bashed Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in the past as a “scam” backed by nothing, which threatens the dominance of the U.S. dollar. Nevertheless, he was </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/former-potus-donald-trump-says-crypto-is-dangerous-but-praises-melanias-nft-project/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">supportive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> of his wife’s NFT foray last year. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t want to have all these other (cryptocurrencies),” he said in an interview with FOX business at the time. “There could be an explosion someday, the likes of which we’ve never seen. It will make the big tech explosion look like baby stuff. I think it’s a very dangerous thing.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Crypto Twitter couldn’t help but appreciate the contradiction since Trump unveiled his NFTs on Thursday. In total disbelief, crypto podcast host Scott Melker </span><a href="https://twitter.com/scottmelker/status/1603435725990551554?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1603435725990551554%7Ctwgr%5Ee24b092aa362577b925bc136ca813ea049535c41%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdecrypt.co%2F117317%2Fdonald-trump-nft-collection-crypto-cant-even" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> he hoped the collection would ultimately go to zero so the industry could “start again.”</span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Which way bitcoin’s price will go next is a question with many zeroes on it for many crypto investors as we finish 2022. Who knows? Here are 8 key factors to consider.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2022 Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the bevy of altcoins riding on the original gangster cryptocurrency&#8217;s very long coattails weathered their most brutal crypto winter to date. Of course, the cryptocurrency industry is eager for an end to the long, drawn-out Bitcoin price winter.</p>
<p>From Bitcoin miners and mining pools to Layer-2 chain developers like the Lightning Network to crypto day traders and crypto investors &#8211; confidence is shaken, fear and greed are high, and the metaphorical blood just keeps pouring out into the streets. When will it end?</p>
<h2>2023 Bitcoin Price History Was a Doozy and a Half</h2>
<p>The sharp market correction after the $69K ATH in November 2021 was reasonable, understandable, and even expected by many. When the price fell to the $30,000 handle in May, it was nerve-wracking. But the Bitcoin price still looked pretty good to anyone hodling bitcoin from Jan 1, 2018, through Jan 1, 2021. During that three-year period, BTC traded at an average of around $10,000.</p>
<p>Then, the fear really started to set in when Bitcoin&#8217;s price fell into an unequivocal crypto winter pattern as the Northern Hemisphere approached summer. The sudden slide during one week in June from the $30K handle to the $20K level was a major shock to the heart of crypto traders.</p>
<p>As we round out Q4 toward 2023, the situation with Bitcoin&#8217;s price is especially dire. While there was no doubt at all that we were in winter all year, at least Bitcoin held at the key support level of $20K from June until the beginning of November.</p>
<h2>FUD Sets In, Then Goes From Bad to Worse</h2>
<p>That $20,000 price per coin was an important psychological support level. Four-and-a-half months of price action firmly in the vicinity of that number seemed, after the dramatic price collapses in H1, like the good promise of a drawn-out bottom before the next trend rally.</p>
<p>The question now is how will Bitcoin perform in Q1 2023 and beyond.</p>
<p>There are several proverbial 8,000-pound gorillas in the room:</p>
<p>Among others &#8211; rampant losses to financially and legally insane crypto ventures, fierce competition from smart contract chains, the question of BTC&#8217;s correlation to U.S. tech stocks, intense regulatory ambiguity, and a pause from wary but very interested institutional investors.</p>
<p>The following is a brief summary review of 8 key long-range factors and their confluences on the Bitcoin price heading into 2023. (You can read a similar analysis and commentary published by the same author on CryptoPotato for the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/will-bitcoin-price-rally-continue-in-2021-8-key-considerations/" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin price at the beginning of 2021 here</a>.)</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/bearbitcoin_cover.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-119996" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/bearbitcoin_cover.jpg" alt="bearbitcoin_cover" width="1201" height="720" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/bearbitcoin_cover.jpg 1201w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/bearbitcoin_cover-300x180.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/bearbitcoin_cover-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/bearbitcoin_cover-768x460.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/bearbitcoin_cover-50x30.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1201px) 100vw, 1201px" /></a></p>
<h2>Bearish Indicators: Four Bitcoin Headwinds in 2023</h2>
<h3>1. Collapses of LUNA, FTX, and Others in 2022 Are Weighing on The Spot Price of Bitcoin</h3>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t find out who&#8217;s been swimming naked until the tide goes out&#8221; is an oft-used aphorism of Warren Buffett, the old &#8216;Oracle of Omaha,&#8217; to describe the effect of broad market corrections on the weakest participants in the game. They shake out of the game altogether as the downturn becomes a cash squeeze for the underlying businesses evaluated by the market.</p>
<p>The first phase of 2022&#8217;s Bitcoin winter appeared to market watchers as a clear-cut case of a necessary and inevitable price correction to a deeply overheated price level after the Nov 2021 peak. But the secondary effect of the price correction was to see who was just boasting to investors and who really had cash reserves to weather the Bitcoin crash. When the bear market revealed several crypto enterprises were insolvent, it sent the prices of BTC, along with other coins cratering over the rest of the year. Investors are now understandably wary to divine the industry and exchange markets to pick out winners.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s bear market revelations of insolvency and zero confidence in billion-dollar crypto startups like LUNA, FTX, and several crypto hedge funds even hit high-profile crypto investors <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/winklevoss-crypto-firm-employees-saw-020240051.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">like the Winklevoss Twins</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/08/ftx-spokesman-kevin-oleary-says-he-lost-15-million-crypto-payday.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Kevin O&#8217;Leary</a>, costing them dearly.</p>
<h3>2. U.S. Crypto Regulatory Ambiguity Could Drag Bitcoin Price Down Through 2023</h3>
<p>Regulatory ambiguity toward cryptocurrencies in the United States and across the globe where major crypto players operate is hurting the industry&#8217;s growth prospects by keeping huge investors on pause. They&#8217;re waiting to know what the government is going to do about cryptocurrencies before jumping into these turbulent waters.</p>
<p>Investing in cryptocurrency is fraught enough with dangers and risks, even without a sudden encroachment by government regulators that unexpectedly raises regulatory compliance costs. One of the most critical questions hanging in limbo at the moment is whether the United States will classify cryptocurrencies as commodities, securities, or something else entirely.</p>
<h3>3. Bitcoin Faces More Fierce Competition Than Ever</h3>
<p>While the constant and seemingly never-ending tumble of crypto prices this year has shocked investors, the crypto industry&#8217;s developers have been plugging away through the Bitcoin winter to improve the sectors&#8217; products and get them ready for more adoption and scale. <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/peter-schiff-blames-altcoins-for-bitcoins-fall-as-ethereum-merge-nears/" data-wpel-link="internal">Competition from BTC substitutes</a> like Ethereum and other altcoins could keep the original gangster crypto from rallying with the strength it otherwise could.</p>
<p>Vitalik Buterin, in <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1599166783541628928" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">a recent reply</a> to a frustrated crypto investor on Twitter, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;d recommend increasing your distance from trading/investing circles, and getting closer to the tech and application ecosystem. Learn about ZK-SNARKs, visit a meetup in Latin America, listen to All Core Devs calls and read the notes until you&#8217;ve memorized all the EIP numbers&#8230;&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s what Buterin and the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ethereum-completes-merge-successfully-crypto-markets-take-a-beating-this-weeks-recap/" data-wpel-link="internal">Ethereum team have been doing</a>, not sweating the extended market price downturn and keeping their heads down and their nose to the grindstone. <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/what-is-the-merge-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-transition-to-ethereum-2-0/" data-wpel-link="internal">The Ethereum merge to upgrade Ethereum Mainnet</a> from a proof-of-work system to a proof-of-stake network is calculated to scale the smart contract blockchain&#8217;s adoption faster when the next bull run occurs. <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/the-merge-is-official-ethereums-transition-to-proof-of-stake-now-complete/" data-wpel-link="internal">It was completed in September</a>.</p>
<h3>4. Bitcoin / Stock Market Correlation Stronger Than Ever</h3>
<p>Macro conditions are difficult for all financial markets heading into 2023. As Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1600945923898556417" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">recently summarized</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Macro conditions are difficult: energy in Europe, real estate in China &amp; crazy Fed rates in USA&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, permabear Nouriel Roubini (who attention markets call &#8220;Dr. Doom&#8221; for his inveterate bearishness) <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/12/07/how-bad-recession-economist-dr-doom-nouriel-roubini-stock-market-forecast/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">predicts a</a> looming severe recession will continue to discount U.S. stock prices. Even though the broad S&amp;P 500 benchmark is already down some 15% for the year, Roubini says we can expect another 25% haircut on stock prices from here.</p>
<p>Because the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/the-high-bitcoin-and-ethereum-correlation-with-wall-street-continues/" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin stock market correlation</a> has <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoins-price-has-correlated-with-us-stocks-for-the-last-month/" data-wpel-link="internal">remained tightly coupled</a> for over a year now, if stocks continue to go down, they could easily take bitcoin spot prices down with them.

<h2>Bullish Indicators: Four Bitcoin Tailwinds in 2023</h2>
<h3>1. Bitcoin / Stock Market Correlation Stronger Than Ever (Familiar?)</h3>
<p>Now the Bitcoin to stock market correlation could be a bullish indicator for bitcoin, depending on your view of how equities markets will move in 2023. If equities continue their downward trend into Q1 and Q2, supposing the Bitcoin spot price remains coupled to stocks, we will see a bear market extending into 2023.</p>
<p>However, if Bitcoin does not decouple from the stock market and we get a NASDAQ rally in 2023, odds are good that bitcoin spot prices will rally along with the broader tech and overall economy benchmarks.</p>
<p>In the very short term, stocks <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-stock-market-investors-shouldnt-count-on-a-santa-claus-rally-this-year-11670628375" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">are unlikely</a> to get a Santa Claus rally to round out Q4. It could very well be, though, that stocks will rally again in 2023 after posting significant losses for the calendar year of 2022. (On the year-to-date pane, the NASDAQ Composite is down some 30%, while the S&amp;P 500 Index is down 18%.</p>
<p>At least one top Wall Street analyst <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-of-the-most-frequently-cited-risks-to-stocks-in-2023-is-overstated-140558319.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">says that</a> one of the biggest headwinds potentially facing stocks in 2023&#8211; downward revisions in earnings estimates&#8211; is overstated. That&#8217;s because changes in Year over Year earnings have a statistical correlation to stock price changes of virtually zero.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a recent report by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/08/retail-investors-say-stock-market-will-bottom-in-2023-finimize-survey.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">CNBC is optimistic</a> about a stock market rally in 2023, citing retail investors&#8217; sentiment. They seem to think the bottom will be in next year and are going on a buying spree of tech equities especially.</p>
<h3>2. Bitcoin Is Oversold Like Crazy As We Head into 2023</h3>
<p>Perhaps one of the most important bullish leading indicators for the Bitcoin price next year is the absolutely <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/three-reasons-bitcoin-is-oversold-like-crazy-right-now-opinion/" data-wpel-link="internal">viciously oversold condition</a> of bitcoin trading pairs on liquid crypto exchange markets.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is so oversold at this point that its trendline on the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/dSTTgyYJ-Bitcoin-Rainbow-chart/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">has screamed straight through</a> the &#8220;BUY!&#8221; zone and settled for months now in the &#8220;Basically A Fire Sale!&#8221; zone of the chart.</p>
<p>The logarithmically graphed Bitcoin Rainbow Chart is a static BTC trading recommendation tool that helps investors and traders to determine the fair value of Bitcoin on the basis of its historical trends.</p>
<h3>3. BTC Fundamentals Are Strong</h3>
<p>While the price of a coin at the exchange has taken one steep fall after another, with each headline-making hit to the industry&#8217;s big players, the fundamentals of the economy and market for Bitcoin remain strong.</p>
<p>While the hash rate <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/hash-ribbon-reversal-confirms-bitcoin-miner-capitulation-phase/" data-wpel-link="internal">has dropped some</a> over the last month, the overall view of the Bitcoin economy is one of a very <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-hash-rate-marks-new-all-time-high-after-55-increase-in-2-months/" data-wpel-link="internal">solid hash rate</a> to price ratio for the Bitcoin network.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/three-reasons-bitcoin-is-oversold-like-crazy-right-now-opinion/" data-wpel-link="internal">Miners have continued to invest</a> heavily in their operations even with the price in steep and entrenched capitulation all year. Throughout the Bitcoin winter, a solid half to near-half of the coins held have actually been <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/half-of-bitcoin-is-held-at-a-net-unrealized-profit/" data-wpel-link="internal">held at an unrealized profit</a>.</p>
<h3>4. It&#8217;s About to Rain Institutional Investors and Hedge Funds</h3>
<p>Most of the institutional investment in cryptocurrencies is yet to come as we finish 2022. Big hedge funds that invest for retirees&#8217; pensions and venture capitalists are still waiting with dry powder to get in on the opportunities that Bitcoin&#8217;s price growth and volatility represent for them.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/most-institutional-investment-in-crypto-is-still-late-in-2022-opinion/" data-wpel-link="internal">They&#8217;re waiting</a> to get the regulatory green light from authorities to advance, and as they&#8217;re waiting, they continue to learn and hire blockchain experts and engineers to make preparations for when that day finally comes &#8211; maybe in 2023.</p>
<p>When they finally enter, allocating a half percent or one percent of their books to crypto like Bitcoin or Ethereum, the market will undoubtedly find a new center of gravity, with resilient key support at a much higher level than the market has so far seen with retail investors.</p>
<p>Also: Don&#8217;t forget the Millennials! <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/social-security-gets-8-boost-why-millennials-are-turning-to-crypto-opinion/" data-wpel-link="internal">They like crypto better than stocks</a>.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[After Serum, another Solana-based DEX seems to have had its administrator key compromised.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raydium – a Solana-based decentralized exchange (DEX) – was hacked for over $2 million on Friday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to Raydium, the hacker appears to have taken control of the exchange’s admin address to carry out the attack. </span></p>
<h2>Over $2 Million Lost</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raydium </span><a href="https://twitter.com/RaydiumProtocol/status/1603762271028748289" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">acknowledged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> the hack over Twitter, noting that investigations were still ongoing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It provided a link to the attacker’s </span><a href="https://solana.fm/address/AgJddDJLt17nHyXDCpyGELxwsZZQPqfUsuwzoiqVGJwD/transfers?cluster=mainnet-bd1" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">account</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, which appears to hold $1.45 million worth of Solana-based tokens at writing time. Solscan </span><a href="https://solscan.io/account/AgJddDJLt17nHyXDCpyGELxwsZZQPqfUsuwzoiqVGJwD" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">shows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that this balance is mostly comprised of SOL ($1.4 million) and SPL tokens ($44,000).</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Initial understanding is owner authority was overtaken by the attacker, but the authority has been halted on AMM &amp; farm programs for now,” said Raydium. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Arkham, a crypto-intelligence provider, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/ArkhamIntel/status/1603754277620445184" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">stated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> earlier that the Solana account had already drained multiple liquidity pools on Raydium. It recommended withdrawing funds from Raydium as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that’s not the whole story: investigating the matter, on-chain sleuth ZachXBT added that about $2 million in funds have already been </span><a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1603758780528861185" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">bridged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to Ethereum. Those funds were then quickly deposited into Tornado Cash – a crypto privacy mixer that was sanctioned by the US Treasury Department in August. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">ZachXBT’s finding has been </span><a href="https://twitter.com/nansenportfolio/status/1603762024667746305?t=jZ-QI3dUiHdGD3Glkc80Fg&amp;s=19" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">corroborated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by Nansen, which noted that $2.2 million in tokens, including $1.6 million in SOL, were withdrawn from Raydium by the hacker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">DeFiLlama <a href="https://defillama.com/protocol/raydium" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">shows</a> that $35 million in funds still remain on the DEX. </span></p>
<h2>Solana’s Woes</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The crypto bear market has not been kind to Solana, including both its native asset and defi ecosystem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The collapse of FTX and Alameda Research – two firms that were bullish supporters of the network – has seen SOL fall well away from crypto’s top ten. The token is worth just $12 at writing time, compared to $36 on November 5th prior to FTX’s liquidity crunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, Serum – another Solana-based DEX – has been forced to </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/serum-srm-backs-community-hard-fork-plans-after-ftx-collapse/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">start anew</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, as its own validator key was compromised when FTX went down. The new protocol – Openbooks – is supposed to be community driven. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fallout also caused Serum’s SRM token to tank by over 75% since November 6th. The Solana Foundation held over $100 million in SRM on FTX at that time, which has now been </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/solana-foundation-lost-over-180-million-in-crypto-on-ftx/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">entirely lost</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The month before that was a catastrophe for DeFi more broadly. Ultimately ending with </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/hacktober-finished-with-657-million-losses-from-crypto-exploits/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">$657 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in losses from smart contract exploits. </span></p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PR &#8211; San Francisco, United States, 15th December, 2022, Chainwire]</strong></p>
<p>We are thrilled to announce that the TrueUSD team is launching a new product called TCNH, which is a stablecoin pegged to Offshore Chinese Yuan (CNH) at 1:1. TCNH will be deployed on one of the fastest growing public blockchains, TRON, where users can obtain, hold, and trade the token.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that TCNH is a stablecoin pegged to Offshore Chinese Yuan (CNH). By definition, offshore currencies are stored and traded outside the issuing country while not subject to its financial regulations. They are often used as foreign exchange reserves, or for international investments or settlements. TCNH is safe and transparent. Like other TrueUSD products, TCNH complies with all relevant legal and technical requirements and is audited by world-leading accounting firms.</p>
<p>TCNH provides a new option for tens of millions of users on the TRON blockchain. It’s the latest manifestation of our commitment to digitizing traditional fiat currencies and further connecting the crypto world with the real world. TCNH will become a part of increasingly diverse stablecoin offerings for global users.</p>
<p>Annabel Gan, TUSD Director of Marketing and Business Development, commented &#8220;We&#8217;ve seen that financial markets like Hong Kong are moving towards becoming a global hub for digital currencies so our products are constantly evolving. We believe that TCNH will further cement our leading position in digital currency infrastructure and contribute to our effort of building a trustworthy and decentralized global payment network.&#8221;</p>
<h2><strong>About TCNH</strong></h2>
<p>TCNH is a TRON-based stablecoin pegged to Offshore Chinese Yuan (CNH) at 1:1. It is issued by the TrueUSD team and a sister product of TUSD. For more information, please visit tusd.io/tcnh.</p>
<h2><strong>About TUSD</strong></h2>
<p>TrueUSD (TUSD) is the first digital asset with live on-chain attestations by independent third-party institutions and is backed 1:1 with USD. So far, it has been listed on more than 100 trading platforms such as Binance and Huobi, and is live on 12 mainstream public chains including Ethereum, TRON, Avalanche, BNB Chain, Fantom, and Polygon. TrueUSD is attested to in real-time by Armanino, one of the largest US-based accounting firms, to ensure the 1:1 ratio of its USD reserve to the circulating token supply and the 100% collateral rate. Users can access the publicly available audit results via the official website tusd.io at any time. TUSD was granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the Commonwealth of Dominica on October 7th 2022.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[SBF gets arrested, CZ reassures Binance is in good financial standing, MetaMask teams with PayPal, and other exciting events in the past 7 days.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The biggest news of the past seven days is undoubtedly the arrest of the former CEO of FTX &#8211; Sam Bankman-Fried. This took place on December 13th in the Bahamas at the request of the US Government. SBF now faces multiple counts of fraud charges, including criminal charges from the US DOJ.</p>
<p>The US Bureau of Labor Statistics also published the numbers for the Consumer Price Index, which clocked in at 7.1%. The expectations were for 7.3%, which sent the markets, including Bitcoin, on a rally. The cryptocurrency topped $18K earlier in the week.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the celebrations were for not as a day later, during the FOMC meeting of the US Federal Reserve, Chairman Jerome Powell announced another 50bps rate hike, sending the crypto markets into a sea of red. The declines transitioned into Friday when BTC&#8217;s price reached an intraday low below $17K.</p>
<p>The crypto markets are riddled with turmoil and uncertainty as questions of Binance&#8217;s solvency worry investors. The exchange has so far shown no signs of an issue, as it was successful in processing over $8 billion in daily withdrawal requests. The CEO, Changpeng Zhao, even said that this doesn&#8217;t qualify as a &#8220;top 5&#8221; day in terms of the most withdrawals and reassured there&#8217;s no number that would put a strain on the exchange as it holds user assets 1:1. The last bit was later confirmed by on-chain analytics resource CryptoQuant, who stated that Binance&#8217;s users&#8217; deposits are 99% collateralized.</p>
<p>On a more positive note, the leading self-custody wallet, MetaMask, teamed up with PayPal to allow select US users to buy ETH directly from the application.</p>
<p>Also, two futures ETFs &#8211; one for BTC and one for ETH &#8211; launched on the Hong Kong Exchange earlier this week. They will be tracking the BTC and ETH prices on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.</p>
<p>All in all, it appears that we are in for an exciting end of 2022.</p>

It also came to light that the firm had been using preferential conditions for quicker trading on FTX.</p>
<p><strong>CZ Binance on Audits, FTX, the $2.1 Billion SBF Buyout in 2021, and Recent Withdrawal Spree. </strong>In an interview for CNBC, Changpeng Zhao <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/cz-binance-on-audits-ftx-the-2-1-billion-sbf-buyout-in-2021-and-recent-withdrawal-spree/" data-wpel-link="internal">talked</a> about the financial standing of Binance, how they handled billions of withdrawals in a day, a potential Big 4 audit, and more.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PR &#8211; British Virgin Islands, BVI, 15th December, 2022, Chainwire]</strong></p>
<p>The Metropoly presale for the METRO token has started successfully, with seven stages sold out and only three remaining. The METRO token presale started at $0.033 and will launch at a fixed price of $0.1. Metropoly has already managed to raise over $300,000 in its<a href="https://presale.metropoly.io/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> presale</a>. The blockchain-based project aims to transform the real estate industry&#8217;s operations, bringing it into the digital age.</p>
<p>Interest in Metropoly&#8217;s presale can be attributed to the fact that more investors are looking for alternative investment opportunities. Real estate-based projects are seen as a strong hedge against inflation and fluctuating market prices.</p>
<p>Implementing crypto in the real estate industry could disrupt one of the oldest industries in the world. It has the potential to remove the middlemen and all the associated fees and delays with buying real estate the traditional way.</p>
<p>Metropoly is the first real-estate NFT marketplace backed 100% by properties. It allows users to invest in real estate properties through NFTs. These NFTs are tied to properties in the real world, and Metropoly users can invest no matter their country or credit score.</p>
<p>Holders of the Real Estate NFTs still receive all the benefits of real estate ownership. This includes earning passive monthly income through the renting out of the property and the long-term appreciation of property values.</p>
<p>With the Metropoly platform, a real estate deal that used to take months to finish can be completed in seconds. It makes it easy for anyone, anywhere in the world, to enter the real estate market and hedge against inflation.</p>
<p>The project has also launched a<a href="https://gleam.io/Zb2di/metropoly-1000000-one-million-usd-giveaway" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> $1 million dollar giveaway</a> where the winner will gain access to a $1 million dollar apartment in the Burj Khalifa. The winner stands to earn up to $100,000 USD per year in rental income from this property alone. There are 10 easy ways to enter this contest, mostly by spreading the word about Metropoly, such as joining its Telegram channel, tweeting about the project, and referring friends.</p>
<p>Metropoly has released a<a href="https://prototype.metropoly.io/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> beta version of its platform</a><u>,</u> whose features include a marketplace, auctions, and mortgages. There is also a designated area to monitor monthly payouts made directly to your wallet in USDT.</p>
<p>The METRO token powers the entire Metropoly ecosystem. It is an ERC20 with a limited supply of 1 billion METRO tokens. The token will be used as a payment and reward method on the Metropoly platform and offers more than 20 use cases.</p>
<p>The Metropoly (METRO) presale is ongoing, and the token can be purchased with USDT, ETH, or BNB. During the current presale stage, 1 METRO token costs $0.05, and the minimum investment is $100 USD.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PR- San Francisco, USA, 13th December, 2022, Chainwire]</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.azarus.io" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Azarus</a> will be hosting a keynote stream in partnership with <a href="https://www.animocabrands.com/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Animoca Brands</a> at 7am UTC on Wednesday, December 14th (11pm PST on Tuesday, December 13th) to reveal the imminent listing on Uniswap of the AzaCoin, an ERC-20 Token on Ethereum Mainnet, which will list on Uniswap on January 11, 2023.</p>
<p>Founded in 2018, Azarus has been demonstrating that “streams are not TV” through its highly engaging Overlay Games. With Azarus, streamers run interactive games over their streams to play along in real-time with their entire audience, sponsored by brands. Overlay Games have generated over 4 million watch hours, distributing $2 million in prizes in the form of loyalty points redeemable in the Azarus Store.</p>
<p>Azarus is moving into a crypto-native rewards program, which will expose millions of loyal players to the benefits of true digital ownership. Azarus is upgrading its AZA points into a crypto-native token, the AzaCoin, giving Azarus holders ownership of the value of their attention and engagement. The AzaCoin will serve as a utility and governance token with the following benefits to the ecosystem:</p>
<ul>
<li>For Streamers: Get immediate access to your earnings with AzaCoins. Host game sessions using your channel’s community wallet. Engage your community through voting.</li>
<li>For Streaming Communities: Gain full ownership of your rewards as AzaCoin is distributed directly to a winner’s crypto wallet offering full control to redeem prizes, bid and buy instantly on streams or to purchase digital assets on the Azarus Marketplace</li>
<li>For Brands: Run and sponsor games for streamers using Azarus as part of their programming</li>
</ul>
<p>This shared desire to participate in the Azarus ecosystem creates a mutually beneficial opportunity as stakeholder incentives align, amplifying the value of the token.</p>
<p>“Azarus has been built on blockchain since the early days, with the vision to materialize the true nature of streams as a distributed digital stadium,” said founder Alex Cassassovici. “Listing the AzaCoin today brings us one step closer to this vision, aligning incentives of all stakeholders and giving the fans true ownership of the rewards they collect playing on stream.”“It’s our belief that Azarus will bring web3 to millions of new users,” wrote Animoca Brands founder Yat Siu. “Since our initial investment, we have been continually impressed at Alex&#8217;s leadership in transforming the medium of streaming into web3 that has already rewarded millions of players with millions of dollars. We&#8217;re beyond excited for the future of Azarus and are proud investors and partners.”</p>
<p>Holders of AzaCoin will have the option to stake their token for 3 months upon earning them in return for receiving a percentage yield back. As a governance token, AzaCoin allows viewers to vote on the usage of AzaCoins in the community wallet to impact the life cycle of Azarus Games on their preferred stream. To learn more about the token, head to <a href="http://azarus.io/azacoin" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">azarus.io/azacoin</a>.</p>

Azarus offers the first platform that provides an environment to build, distribute and monetize Overlay Games on any stream. Overlay Games bring together massive live audiences, revealing the true nature of streams as an interactive medium, supporting the company’s vision that “Streams are not TV.”</p>
