<p>30 days. That&rsquo;s how much longer we have until one of the biggest presales in the past 3 years comes to an end. If you pay attention to the bull market and meme coin corner of the crypto world at all, you&rsquo;ve likely heard of the project that is expected by many to become the next big thing, Big Eyes Coin (BIG). And if you haven&rsquo;t, you found this article at exactly the right time! It seems as though meme coin season is upon us again and the next Dogecoin Killer could be right around the corner, though this time the ones leading the new wave won&rsquo;t be dogs; it&rsquo;ll be a cat and a pair of frogs instead! As weird as that sounds, you&rsquo;ll understand exactly what that means as long as you keep reading!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jump Right into The Croak-pto Game With Pepe and Kermit</p>
<p>The story here is quite similar to the origins of the meme coin as a whole. Just as Dogecoin (DOGE) took its inspiration from the extremely popular Doge meme almost 10 years ago, these two crypto projects take their inspiration from a meme that could potentially be the quintessential meme that represents internet culture today. Pepe The Frog. Regardless of which social media platforms and websites you frequently use, you have 100% seen the Pepe meme and all its iterations. It&rsquo;s impossible to get away from. With that in mind, it&rsquo;s no wonder that the new age of meme coins would follow the same steps as their predecessor with their meme inspiration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PEPE (PEPE), of course named directly after said meme, has been on the receiving hand of exceptional growth and success since its debut in April, not even a complete month ago. Its momentum is incredible, spiking by 2,100% and reaching a $502 million market cap in such a short space of time. Pepe is already being compared to Dogecoin thanks to this, giving it the position of a real successor in many&rsquo;s eyes. It&rsquo;s even similar to it in that there is no real &ldquo;point&rdquo; to the token beyond being a fun alternative to other altcoins, though this has seemingly worked in PEPE&rsquo;s favour. That isn&rsquo;t to say all the new age meme coins are entirely focused on fun with no real utility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kermit takes its imagery from the most famous puppet in the world, Kermit the frog, it&rsquo;s undeniable that Pepe&rsquo;s meme power played a major role both in its reaction and success. Much like Pepe, Kermit launched just last month and has quickly built a following within the crypto community and it&rsquo;s not hard to see why. Beyond the interest it builds through the global influence of both the aforementioned muppet and meme, Kermit is actually a project with real value. It has no taxes, its LP has been burnt and its contract has been renounced, all working together to create a coin with high security and even higher return potential. There is one thing that Kermit missed out on though, something that could&rsquo;ve created an even stronger community to support it, which is a presale. Luckily, Big Eyes makes up for that.</p>

<p>Big Eyes, Big News, Big Plans</p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin (BIG), which has raised an incredible $35 million during its presale, has been making waves in the cryptocurrency community and is likely to continue making more with the announcement of the presale coming to an end 30 days from now on June 3rd. As the launch date approaches, the team promises to make more intriguing announcements that will make the project more alluring. Something we&rsquo;re already aware of that buyers have to look forward to is the Big Eyes NFT release! The NFT collection known as the Sushi Crew will include many fun and entertaining digital assets that are sure to capture the attention of every meme coin and NFT enthusiast around, including ones that feature the big eyed cat mascot and its hijinks. Not only are they exciting items to hold, but they will each have individual and exceptional attributes that will make them incredibly collectible and stand out. NFT&rsquo;s go hand in hand with the concept of meme coins, which makes Big Eyes&rsquo; focus on creating not only a collection but also a marketplace to trade them on a great step in pushing meme coins to the forefront once again! Though the presale will be coming to an end in a month, there is still one final thing that investors can get out of it! The final bonus code END300 gives users 300% extra tokens when used, so use it while you still can!</p>
