<h2>Banks in Argentina Now Authorized to Open Yuan Accounts</h2>
<p>Argentina&#8217;s central bank announced Thursday that it is now allowing Chinese yuan in bank accounts. The announcement states (translated by Google):</p>
<blockquote><p>The Central Bank of the Argentine Republic has incorporated the renminbi yuan as an accepted currency for deposit-taking in savings banks and checking accounts. Financial entities will thus be enabled to open bank accounts denominated in renminbi yuan.</p></blockquote>
<p>The decision by Argentina&#8217;s central bank to incorporate the Chinese yuan aligns with the country&#8217;s struggle against a dwindling supply of U.S. dollars. The move also coincides with China&#8217;s ongoing efforts to promote the internationalization of its currency.</p>
<p>In addition, Argentina&#8217;s National Securities Commission announced in June that it would allow dealing in renminbi-denominated securities. Earlier this month, China’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), and Argentina’s Central Bank signed an agreement for a 130 billion yuan ($17.9 billion) bilateral currency swap over three years.</p>
<p>BBVA Research’s senior China economist, Dong Jinyue, was quoted by the South China Morning Post as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Opening yuan accounts could attract more people and enterprises to exchange Argentinian peso to yuan, as more or less a ‘safe haven’ currency, instead of exchanging all of their local currency to U.S. dollars.</p></blockquote>
<p>“The diversification of foreign currency exchange will surely help alleviate the US dollar shortage in Argentina because US dollars become not the only foreign currency to exchange,” he opined.</p>

<p>Stephen Olson, a senior research fellow at the Hinrich Foundation, described:</p>
<blockquote><p>Given rising geopolitical tensions, China is growing increasingly uncomfortable with the pre-eminent role of the U.S. dollar in conducting international trade.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some people believe that the Chinese yuan has the potential to erode the dominance of the U.S. dollar in global financial markets, including <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/chinese-yuan-euro-digital-currencies-challenge-us-dollar-dominance-td-economist-says/">TD economist Vikram Rai</a>. Russia’s VTB Bank Chairman <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/chinese-yuan-to-replace-us-dollar-as-worlds-reserve-currency-says-russian-banker/">Andrey Kostin</a>, who is sanctioned by the U.S., said in May that the Chinese yuan could replace the U.S. dollar as the world’s main reserve and settlement currency as early as the next decade. In addition, many people expect a proposed <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-discusses-viability-of-brics-currency-says-pegging-to-chinese-yuan-would-be-first-major-step/">common BRICS currency</a> to challenge the USD’s hegemony.</p>

<h2>Stark Defends SEC Chair Gensler</h2>
<p>Former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) official John Reed Stark has defended SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, calling on the crypto community to quit personal attacks on him. Stark is currently president of cybersecurity firm John Reed Stark Consulting. He founded and served as chief of the SEC Office of Internet Enforcement for 11 years. He was also an SEC enforcement attorney for 15 years.</p>
<p>Gensler has said several times that all crypto tokens, besides bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>), are securities. His stance has raised concerns among many who perceive it as a preconceived judgment. However, when questioned in April by Congressman Patrick McHenry regarding whether ether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) is a security, Gensler evaded a direct answer, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ethers-security-status-remains-unclear-as-sec-chair-gensler-fails-to-answer-lawmakers-question/">insisting</a> he will not make any prejudgments on the matter.</p>
<p>Responding to some people calling for Gensler to recuse himself from enforcement actions concerning crypto, Stark cited Hester Peirce, a pro-crypto SEC commissioner widely recognized in the cryptocurrency community as &#x201C;crypto mom&#x201D; as an example. He asserted:</p>
<blockquote><p>SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce has a clearly pro-crypto ethos but never in a million years would I expect her to recuse herself because of her beliefs. And the same goes for SEC Chair Gary Gensler.</p></blockquote>
<p>He explained that &#x201C;Commissioner Peirce has dissented from, or criticized, just about every SEC effort to stop crypto-madness.&#x201D; In addition, she &#x201C;blames the SEC for crypto&#x2019;s massive collapse and impending doom,&#x201D; which Stark likened to &#x201C;the CEO of Marlboro blaming the FDA for lung cancer caused by cigarettes.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Stark stated: &#x201C;With all due respect to Hester, her pro-crypto antics not only place at risk the investors she is sworn to protect, but they also don&#x2019;t pass the straight face test.&#x201D; He advised:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#x2019;s time for Commissioner Peirce to abdicate all &#x2018;crypto mom&#x2019; duties and Big Crypto fealty and join the litany of expert computer scientists who believe that when it comes to crypto/defi/NFTs and other web3 nonsense, there is no there there. But recusal? Absolutely not.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many crypto proponents have criticized Gensler for taking an enforcement-centric approach to regulating the crypto industry. The SEC chairman is also heavily scrutinized for meeting with executives of the collapsed crypto exchange FTX, including former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who is currently facing multiple criminal charges.</p>
<p>Stark believes that both Gensler and Peirce have earned the right to be a member of the SEC and both deserve to press their points of view whenever they please. Furthermore, they have the freedom to decide whether or not to hold meetings with cryptocurrency executives as frequently as they want. &#x201C;That is not regulatory capture but is good communication and education,&#x201D; Stark said.</p>

<p>Moreover, Stark stressed: &#x201C;I have taught a cyber/securities regulation course at both Georgetown and Duke Law Schools for 20 years &#x2014; and what I say in the classroom is irrelevant to how I served as an SEC enforcement lawyer. The same should go for Chair Gensler.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Stark also shared that during his 11-year tenure as the chief of the SEC Office of Internet Enforcement, he actively engaged with various individuals from the securities industry. He noted that these interactions were essential for him to acquire knowledge, stay updated, and attentively listen to different perspectives. &#x201C;This was not unethical, it was in my job description, and the same goes for Chair Gensler,&#x201D; he emphasized, concluding:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#x2019;s time to attack the facts and law on SEC positions and quit the personal attacks on the SEC Chair or the SEC staff. It&#x2019;s an anemic and flawed pivot that does not work in a courtroom and is a transparent and bush-league attempt to rally the mob.</p></blockquote>

Notably, Cboe&#8217;s amended filings now include Coinbase as a partner in the surveillance-sharing agreement for the spot bitcoin ETFs.</strong></p>
<h2>Cboe Responds to SEC&#8217;s Concerns, Revises Spot Bitcoin ETF Filings With Coinbase Collaboration</h2>
<p>Following a report by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/insiders-say-sec-deems-blackrocks-spot-bitcoin-etf-and-other-applications-as-inadequate/">disclosing</a> the dissatisfaction of SEC insiders with the recent batch of spot bitcoin ETF applications by several prominent financial institutions, including <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/blackrock-files-for-bitcoin-trust-analyst-calls-it-a-real-deal-spot-bitcoin-etf-filing/">Blackrock</a>, Wisdomtree, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/valkyrie-funds-joins-race-for-sec-approval-as-it-files-application-for-spot-bitcoin-etf/">Valkyrie</a>, Fidelity, Ark Investment, and Invesco, four firms re-submitted their filings on Friday.</p>
<p>In an article by WSJ contributor Vicky Ge Huang, insiders, described as &#8220;people familiar with the matter,&#8221; revealed on Friday that the regulatory body deemed the ETF registrations inadequate. Cboe and Nasdaq were among those informed of this development, the WSJ report noted.</p>
<p>According to Ge Huang&#8217;s report, a spokeswoman from Cboe confirmed the exchange&#8217;s intention to resubmit its spot bitcoin ETF filings. True to their word, Cboe proceeded to <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1674882432506511360?s=20">update</a> and make necessary <a href="https://www.cboe.com/us/equities/regulation/rule_filings/">amendments</a> to the filings, which were initially submitted by Fidelity, Vaneck, Invesco, and Wisdomtree.</p>
<p>A significant development in the amendments came on Friday, as Coinbase was designated as a surveillance-sharing agreement (SSA) partner. It&#8217;s worth noting that while Blackrock and Ark did not resubmit their applications, Blackrock had already identified Coinbase as its SSA partner.</p>

<p>To date, the U.S. regulatory watchdog remains skeptical of the spot bitcoin ETF sponsors&#8217; ability to safeguard the funds against manipulation and ensure investor protection. Despite granting approval for multiple futures exchange-traded funds, the SEC recently greenlit a bitcoin futures ETF with leverage.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the latest ETF applications and Blackrock&#8217;s filing have designated Coinbase as a surveillance-sharing agreement (SSA) partner. However, it&#8217;s important to note that the San Francisco-based firm is currently entangled in a legal dispute with the securities regulator, as the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-becomes-the-latest-target-of-sec-accused-of-unregistered-brokerage-and-securities-violations/">SEC filed a lawsuit</a> against the exchange.</p>
<p><em><strong>Will the inclusion of Coinbase as a surveillance-sharing partner in the resubmitted spot Bitcoin ETF filings be enough to satisfy the SEC&#8217;s concerns? Share your thoughts and opinions about this subject in the comments section below.</strong></em></p>

Inscription activity has continued to rise since then. In addition to text, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and fungible BRC20 tokens, Ordinal inscription technology has ushered in a new naming standard called Sats Names, built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin&#x2019;s Sats Names Emerge</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://ordinals.com/">statistics</a>, in June 2023, Ordinal inscriptions surpassed the 14 million mark. As of July 1, 2023, there are now over <a href="https://ordinals.com/inscription/29230dc6f06c9cbfbfcf8c90105ee7166a6c77f71fbb0ee3c322096e48cc74dci0">14.41 million inscriptions</a>. So far, this trend has provided bitcoin miners with an additional <a href="https://dune.com/dgtl_assets/bitcoin-ordinals-analysis">1,799.65 BTC</a>, equivalent to roughly $54 million in inscription-related fees.</p>
<p>The vast majority (86%) of these inscriptions are simple plain text, while the remaining inscriptions are various file types such as JPGs and PNGs. Furthermore, Ordinal inscriptions have catalyzed the emergence of a new form of Bitcoin-based tokens under the BRC20 standard.</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/exploring-the-world-of-rare-satoshis-collectors-embrace-the-value-of-unique-bitcoin-artifacts/">new concepts</a> such as &#x201C;rare satoshis&#x201D; or &#x201C;satributes&#x201D; have emerged, along with a new trend known as Sats Names. <a href="https://docs.sats.id/sats-names/sns-spec/mint-names">Sats Names</a>, also referred to as SNS, is a standard for creating human-readable names on the Bitcoin blockchain using Ordinal inscription technology.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-595852 size-full" title="Bitcoin's Sats Names Ecosystem Flourishes: 370,000 SNS Names Inscribed" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cc.jpg" alt="Bitcoin's Sats Names Ecosystem Flourishes: 370,000 SNS Names Inscribed" width="1280" height="300" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cc-300x70.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cc-1024x240.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cc-768x180.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cc.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>This allows users to mint names with appended extensions like .sats and .xbt. For example, a user could choose a name like satoshi.sats or jimmy.sats. The guidelines specify that each ordinal can have only one name, and any UTF-8 character is permissible.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Capitalization does not matter,&#x201D; the Sats Names documentation details. &#x201C;All names will be registered as lowercase. No spaces are permitted within a name.&#x201D;</p>
<p>To check the availability of a Sats Name, individuals can use the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/satsnames/repositories">Sats Names API</a>, a web service that allows users to query the availability of Sats Names. Names are obtained on a first-come, first-served basis and can be purchased through various marketplaces focused on Ordinals.</p>
<p>The concept of decentralized name services has been present since Namecoin in 2011, and similar ideas have been implemented on other blockchains, such as the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) standard.</p>

<p>According to the Sats Names documentation, as of June 2023, there have been 250,000 .sats names inscribed, along with an additional 120,000 SNS names inscribed for other namespaces such as .ord, .btc, and .xbt.</p>
<p>The documentation indicates that so far, around 50,000 users currently possess SNS names, and it states that SNS name resolution is supported on the Unisat wallet and Ordinals wallet.</p>

The latest figures show a slide from $739.50 million recorded in May to $707.70 million in June.</strong></p>
<h2>June 2023 Sees a Slip in NFT Sales</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/nftglobal">Data</a> from cryptoslam.io reveals that NFT sales in the previous month experienced a slight decrease compared to May. In June, a total of $707.70 million in sales was recorded, with $452 million attributed to Ethereum-based NFT sales. These Ethereum NFT sales constituted over 63% of the overall sales for the month, indicating a 7.89% increase from the previous month&#x2019;s ETH-based NFT sales.</p>
<p>Among 22 different networks, Bitcoin emerges as the second-highest blockchain in terms of sales. In June, BTC-based NFT sales amounted to $110.30 million, representing 15.60% of the total sales. However, there was a significant decline of 42.36% in Bitcoin-centric NFT sales compared to the previous month&#x2019;s figures. On the other hand, Solana-based NFT sales witnessed a remarkable surge, soaring 65% higher than the previous month&#x2019;s sales, reaching an impressive $70.42 million.</p>

<p>Completing the top five blockchains in terms of sales are Mythos and Polygon, trailing behind <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, and SOL. However, both Mythos and Polygon experienced a decline in NFT sales during June compared to May. Mythos registered $28,322,124 in sales, representing a decrease of 19.75%, while Polygon saw sales amounting to $27,846,781, marking a significant drop of 45.91% from the previous month. Taking the lead as the highest-grossing NFT collection in June, based on 30-day sales, was Uncategorized Ordinals, raking in an impressive total of $52.91 million.</p>

<p>In June, Uncategorized Ordinal NFT sales witnessed a notable increase of 1.44% compared to May. Following closely behind was the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), securing the second spot with $49.76 million, up 28.20% higher than BAYC sales in May. The subsequent three leading collections after Uncategorized Ordinal NFT and BAYC NFT sales were Azuki, Azuki Elemental, and SMB Barrel Raffle. Among the top five <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io">highest-priced NFT sales</a> in June, four out of five were BTC-based NFTs, with the exception being the NFT Fidenza #545.</p>

<h2>Litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>)</h2>
<p>Litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>) was once again a big mover in cryptocurrency markets, as the token rallied to a multi-month high.</p>
<p>Following a low of $91.73 during Friday&#x2019;s session, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>/USD raced to an intraday high of $111.76 earlier today.</p>
<p>As a result of the rally, litecoin peaked at its strongest point since April 7 last year, when price reached a top at $116.00.</p>

<p>After breaking out of a ceiling at 61.00 on the relative strength index (RSI), <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a> bulls took the index past yet another ceiling.</p>
<p>This time at the 68.00 level, with price strength peaking at 73.91 to start the weekend, which is its highest point since January.</p>
<p>Litecoin has since gone on to retreat from today&#x2019;s high, and as of writing, is trading at $110.17.</p>

<h2>Dogecoin (DOGE)</h2>
<p>Another notable gainer on Saturday was dogecoin (DOGE), which climbed to a three-week high to start the weekend.</p>
<p>DOGE/USD jumped to a peak of $0.07079 earlier in the day, less than 24 hours after falling to $0.06264.</p>
<p>The move saw the world&#x2019;s largest meme coin jump nearly 5% higher, hitting its highest level since June 10 in the process.</p>

<p>As can be seen from the chart, Saturday&#x2019;s surge saw dogecoin collide with a key resistance level at $0.07000, before dropping lower.</p>
<p>DOGE is now trading at $0.06835, with the RSI hovering around the 56.00 mark, which is marginally above a ceiling at 55.00.</p>
<p>A target of $0.0750 likely remains on the agenda for bulls, however they face some challenges this weekend in order to reach this point.</p>

Markets moved to rebound on Saturday, after better than expected consumer sentiment data in the United Stated spooked traders. Bitcoin also rebounded, after falling below $30,000 on Friday.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>After falling below the $30,000 level during Friday&#x2019;s session, bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) rebounded on Saturday, however sentiment was still somewhat bearish.</p>
<p>Following a high of $31,093.98 on Friday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD dropped to an intraday low at $29,600.28 as the session progressed.</p>
<p>However, the price is now trading at $30,444.75, as bulls moved to buy the dip, pushing <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> higher to start the weekend.</p>

<p>As per the chart, the rebound came as the relative strength index (RSI) found a floor at the 63.00 mark.</p>
<p>The index is now tracking at 65.64, and seems to be heading for a resistance point around the 70.00 level.</p>
<p>A collision with this target will likely result in bitcoin once again moving above $31,000.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>On the other hand, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) was largely bullish to start the weekend, with price surging to a two-month high.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD has peaked at $1,945.27 so far on Saturday, which comes a day after falling to a low at $1,831.28.</p>
<p>As a result of this rally, the world&#x2019;s second largest cryptocurrency jumped to its strongest point since May 6.</p>

<p>One of the reasons for this move was a breakout, which saw the RSI move past a ceiling at the 58.00 point.</p>
<p>As of writing, it appears that this break may have been false, and the index is now at a reading of 58.17, giving up earlier gains.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> is now trading at $1,914.81.</p>

In an interview on CNBC, Clayton stated that the SEC&#8217;s strategy of bringing myriad cases to court against U.S. corporations was problematic &#8220;at a 30,000-foot level.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Jay Clayton Criticizes SEC&#8217;s Case Volume Strategy</h2>
<p>Jay Clayton, former chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), voiced his concerns with the new &#8220;ethos&#8221; of U.S. regulators, which involves bringing many cases to court, even those they think won&#8217;t succeed. In a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jv8LcYg6QA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a> on CNBC, Clayton referred to this enforcement strategy as a &#8220;fundamental shift&#8221; from how Americans view the role of the government.</p>
<p>About this new strategic approach, Clayton stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to be in a place where I know the government is going to bring cases they think they are going to lose; imagine you are the person that is subject to that case.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, Clayton declared that when agencies have the power of the state, they are &#8220;supposed to only bring cases and only make rules you think are going to pass judicial muster.&#8221;</p>

<h2>U.S. Enforcement Strategy Is &#8216;Problematic&#8217;</h2>
<p>Clayton also noted how state agencies believe that if they are not losing in courts, it can be perceived as if they have failed to fulfill their role as regulators, and how this can present problems for companies involved in these cases.</p>
<p>He explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What you are hearing from the leaders of the regulatory organizations is if we&#8217;re not losing cases, if we&#8217;re not being pushed back on by the courts we&#8217;re not doing enough &#8230; At a 30,000-foot level, I think that&#8217;s problematic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cameron Winklevoss, a co-founder of Gemini, a U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange that is facing a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-charges-genesis-and-gemini-winklevoss-says-regulators-lawsuit-is-super-lame/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawsuit</a> by the SEC &#8220;for the unregistered offer and sale of securities to retail investors through the Gemini Earn crypto asset lending program,&#8221; brought Clayton&#8217;s statements to the crypto space, <a href="https://twitter.com/cameron/status/1674132255906713605?t=CKkdAS6MJNxClaXythm_EA&amp;s=35" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stating</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> Former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton describes the new and deeply un-American ethos of the </span>SEC under <span class="r-18u37iz">Gary Gensler </span>— if we&#8217;re not losing cases, we aren&#8217;t suing enough businesses. This is a total abuse of power.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Previously, Clayton has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/former-sec-chairman-jay-clayton-on-enforcement-actions-crypto-should-be-treated-with-nuance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criticized</a> how some enforcement actions are carried out by the SEC, stating these matters should be approached with more &#8220;nuance.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Africa&#8217;s Share of Global Blockchain Funding Still Under 1%</h2>
<p>According to the latest Emurgo State of Web 3.0 in Africa report, the African continent’s cryptocurrency market &#8220;grew by over 1,200% between 2020 and 2021.&#8221; In addition, four African countries, namely Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa and Tanzania now feature the in the world’s top 20 for crypto adoption.</p>
<p>As shown by the data shared in the <a href="https://www.emurgo.africa/reports/emurgo-web-3-0-research-report.pdf">report</a>, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa accounted for 70% of the $88.5 million in blockchain funding which the continent received in 2021. However, despite this and the fact that African blockchain venture funding growth &#8220;was 11 times more when compared to general funding growth,&#8221; the continent’s share of total global blockchain funding is only 0.5%. This figure is nevertheless expected to grow when more companies attempt to create solutions to solve problems faced by the continent’s residents.</p>
<p>However, despite the underlying technology&#8217;s promise, as well as the impact that crypto assets have had on African residents, the report reveals that as much as 20% of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have banned crypto assets. The rest have either imposed some restrictions or implicit bans. The Central African Republic is the only African country to designate bitcoin as a legal tender.</p>
<p>As noted in the report, many countries in Africa have not embraced crypto assets due to their perceived risky nature. The collapse of crypto giants like the exchange FTX and subsequent ripple effects have seemingly reinforced governments’ negative perceptions about crypto assets.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<h2>Mitigating Against Risks Arising From Regulatory Changes</h2>
<p>Therefore, in order to help the continent’s crypto industry get on the good side of authorities, the authors of the report urged industry participants to consider working closely with regulators.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the need for the regulation of Blockchain and cryptocurrencies increases, key stakeholders need to work closely with regulators. This will ensure that risks that may arise as a result of regulatory changes are adequately mitigated,&#8221; authors of the Emurgo State of Web 3.0 report said.</p>
<p>More transparent regulations, on the other hand, will ostensibly see blockchain’s use cases increase. This increase in use cases will in turn spur further investments in the industry, according to the report.</p>

A rejection would prevent the exchange from advertising and growing in the major European market and deal another blow to its efforts to do regulated business on the Old Continent.</strong></p>
<h2>Germany Rejects Binance Bid to Obtain Bafin License, Sources Claim</h2>
<p>The Federal Financial Supervisory Authority of Germany (<a href="https://www.bafin.de/EN/Homepage/homepage_node.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bafin</a>) has informed Binance it will not be licensed as a crypto custodian, the German financial news magazine Finance Forward revealed in a <a href="https://financefwd.com/de/binance-lizenz-deutschland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> quoting sources familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>The digital asset exchange, the world’s largest by trading volume, can only expand its business in Germany if it receives the regulatory approval, the publication noted. Without it, it’s not allowed to advertise, for example, and German regulators have already targeted other crypto companies for that, including trading platforms like Crypto.com and Uniswap.</p>
<p>Bafin declined to clarify the situation with a spokesperson saying the authority does not comment on individual companies. “While we cannot share details of our discussions with regulators, we are continuing to work to meet Bafin requirements,” a representative of Binance was quoted as stating. The spokesperson emphasized this is an ongoing process and also said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are confident that we have the right team and the appropriate measures in place to continue our discussions with the regulators in Germany.</p></blockquote>
<p> has been under increased pressure from regulatory bodies in Europe and elsewhere. Authorities in Belgium <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-ordered-to-cease-all-crypto-services-in-belgium/">ordered</a> the exchange to cease all crypto services while prosecutors in France <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/french-investigation-targets-binance-allegations-of-money-laundering-and-regulatory-violations/">launched</a> an investigation based on money laundering allegations.</p>
<p>Earlier in June, Binance <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-pulls-out-of-netherlands-seeks-to-deregister-cyprus-unit/">exited</a> the Dutch market, after failing to register as a crypto service provider, applied for deregistration in Cyprus, and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-unit-in-britain-cancels-uk-regulatory-authorization/">cancelled</a> its U.K. authorization. The company also withdrew its application for license in Austria, Finance Forward noted.</p>
<p>This week, news came out that the exchange is looking for a new banking partner for euro deposits and withdrawals after payment processor Paysafe <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-to-lose-euro-transfers-as-paysafe-drops-support/">announced</a> its decision to discontinue support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Euro_Payments_Area" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEPA</a> transfers to and from the cryptocurrency exchange.</p>
