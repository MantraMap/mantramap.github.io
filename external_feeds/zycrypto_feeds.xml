<ul>
<li>BTC, ETH, XRP, and ADA record an uptick in value entering Christmas week. </li>



<li>On the other hand, DOGE is still struggling post-Elon Musk poll and traded lower by 8% in the past 7 days.</li>



<li>With the new year approaching, bulls are pushing their favourite coins to start the year on a high note.</li>
</ul>



<p>Digital asset enthusiasts have seen promise amid a turbulent market following a slight positive movement in the price of several top cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>Market leader Bitcoin (BTC) showed positive signs of a breakout after its price increased by 1% over the weekend, trading at $16,890 but still short of the $17,000 resistance level. Ethereum (ETH), on the other hand had a better weekend going up by 4% and trading at $1,223. </p>



<p>Cardano (ADA), which has performed poorly like other major assets this year, also saw slight gains over the weekend and has continued to be in the green zone on Monday. On the other end is the red zone currently hosting a large number of top assets.</p>



<p>Leading the pack is Elon Musk-backed Dogecoin (DOGE), still trading short sequel to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/dogecoin-takes-biggest-hit-falls-18-following-elon-musks-twitter-poll/">Musk’s Twitter poll</a> last week. DOGE has been down 8% over the past week, with its price hovering around $0.075.</p>



<p>Heavier losses hit Solana (SOL), Polkadot (DOT), Quant (QNT), and other assets in the last seven days. Solana fell 15%, exchanging hands at $11.85, while DOT plummeted 14%. Also recording double-digit losses are QNT and Avalanche (AVAX) losing 12% and 10% respectively ending the week at $105 and $11.78.</p>



<p>The recent losses in these top assets have been attributed to several factors, including the aftermath of the implosion of FTX and the wider bearish performance of the financial market.</p>



<h2 id="h-bulls-look-to-2023"><strong>Bulls look to 2023 </strong></h2>



<p>After a bad run this year, bulls have their eyes locked on 2023, with many already displaying new metrics on why their assets will soar in the new year. In the cryptoverse, the Ripple (XRP) community has been one of the loudest voices on the prospects of their coin, with bulls anticipating it <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-tops-a-three-year-high-above-1-amid-new-turn-in-ripple-lawsuit/">breaking into $1</a> in Q1 2023.</p>



<p>Despite the current setbacks, DOGE fans still hope for their anticipated Twitter use cases like incorporated payments to push the price to a new level. Like XRP, the DOGE community has predicted the coin to hit $1 in 2023. Market leaders BTC and ETH have both lost over 50% of their market cap with investors hoping for a recovery in Q1 2023.</p>

<p>Ethereum, the world&#8217;s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is set to come out ahead of Bitcoin in the next bull market, according to Bloomberg’s senior macro strategist Mike McGlone.</p>



<p>Despite Bitcoin and other risk assets deflating considerably in the past year, McGlone noted in the latest market outlook report that Ethereum <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ethereums-co-founder-vitalik-buterin-discloses-three-landmark-opportunities-for-crypto-in-2023/">exhibited more resilience</a>, suggesting that it “may be a top candidate to continue outperforming the firstborn crypto.”</p>



<p>Since tapping all-time highs in November 2021, Bitcoin and Ethereum have dropped roughly 76% and 75%, respectively. Notably, Ethereum’s annual volatility is about 1.3x that of bitcoin. Thus, while Ethereum is still deeply undervalued, McGlone noted that at a ratio of 0.08, the ETH/BTC cross rate remained the same as in May 2021 when the Nasdaq 100 Stock Index was about 20% higher, tilting ETH towards resuming appreciation if volatility tells us anything.</p>



<p><em>“Our graphic shows the trend of the No. 2 crypto outperforming No. 1, which appeared coincident with the rise of risk assets. This year’s 30% drop in the Nasdaq is part of a receding tide, including about a 65% decline in Ethereum to Dec 16,”</em> he wrote.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/RD4oT4N2vnO9YmzGUXDFFEdiCy6mcljgjmSJ3MnV9cdyrs13ABGjYYawnKFzhoSeMvvnALzjkzGHyjL4b-jYpeOlX35sV4ZPzWldvHoO-zOwZGkUh_cQRZ4tJHJemdF9rp4NEwwdeFq1mMa_AELHb0PgFgnsn_SEirfkTgFnD50IwNJSRKZkclroRRqwdu8Y8r13H3ueQQ" alt=""/></figure>



<h2 id="h-ethereum-s-holy-grail"><strong>Ethereum’s Holy Grail</strong></h2>



<p>According to the pundit, Ethereum’s resilience and projected outperformance against the top crypto-asset are largely tied to mainstream adoption.</p>



<p>“<em>Migration into the mainstream is our key takeaway and once the dust settles from some reversion in risk assets amid inflation pressures, Ethereum is more likely to resume doing what it has been&#8212;outperforming,”</em> Glone added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ethereum has been at the centre of focus in the past year as crypto adoption gathers steam globally.&nbsp;Although the crypto was modelled like bitcoin in its early years, Ethereum went a step further and now powers a wide range of applications through smart contracts -becoming a darling to institutions, developers and enthusiasts who believe that it&#8217;s a valuable altcoin with real-world use cases.</p>



<p>In the past year, thousands of projects and companies, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/paypal-teams-up-with-metamask-to-enable-ethereum-purchases-in-the-us/">such as PayPal</a>, have enrolled their services on the network seeking to make a footprint in the Metaverse, Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized autonomous applications (DAOs).</p>



<p>The demand for Ethereum has largely been depicted in the rise of its market dominance. In 2021, Ethereum’s market dominance rose as high as 22%, suggesting it could “Flippen” Bitcoin at some point.</p>



<p>Ethereum’s migration from Proof-of-Work to a more eco-friendly Proof-of-Stake consensus blockchain earlier this year has also boosted its appeal to governments and institutions worldwide as the push for lesser carbon footprints rages on.</p>



<p>Ethereum was trading at $1,212 after a 0.36% increase in the past 24 hours. On the other hand, Bitcoin was exchanging hands at $16,851 after adding 0.44% in the same period, according to data from CoinMarketCap.</p>

<p>The crypto market could be poised for a price rise going by historical market sentiment data pointed out by the crypto market intelligence tracking platform Santiment.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1593713589113610240?t=8-Z3v8QnNxamUjGtPmFXnA&amp;s=19">tweet</a>, Santiment noted that fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) in the crypto market had reached their most negative level in five months. This is indicated by the fact that conversations relating to crypto on all major social platforms, including Twitter, Reddit, Discord, and Telegram, are leaning towards a major bearish bias.</p>



<p>According to the analysis, such levels of negativity have historically increased the probability of future price rises.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Conversations relating to current market conditions on Twitter, Reddit, Discord, and Telegram indicate a major #bearish bias. This historically increases the probability of future price rises,&#8221; Santiment said.</em></p>



<p>Meanwhile, the metric is not the only bearish indicator Santiment anticipates contributing to a crypto market price bounce. The platform has <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1594767648625131523?t=zpVzSHB1KJuoQws5MuAWRg&amp;s=19">pointed</a> out that the Bitcoin (BTC) market has been seeing many traders finally liquidate their assets as its price has fallen to a two-year low.</p>



<p>The massive exodus of investors has resulted in the BTC market seeing the lowest level of transactions made while in profit since Nov. 2019. According to Santiment, bounces also typically occur when this happens in the market.</p>



<h2 id="h-ftx-collapse-is-still-the-leading-source-of-crypto-market-negative-sentiments"><strong>FTX collapse is still the leading source of crypto market negative sentiments</strong></h2>



<p>The <a href="https://zycrypto.com/a-deliberate-move-shark-tank-star-kevin-oleary-blames-binance-for-ftx-collapse/">FTX collapse</a> and the market contagion it sparked have continued to be the major cause of the crypto market&#8217;s unravelling in recent weeks. The market jitter has now reached Digital Currency Group (DCG) subsidiary Genesis, a liquidity provider to FTX. </p>



<p>According to a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-21/crypto-firm-genesis-warns-of-possible-bankruptcy-without-funding">report</a>, the crypto derivatives trading and lending firm has mentioned that it is considering filing for bankruptcy if it cannot raise around $1 billion in fresh funding from investors.</p>



<p>Aside from affected crypto firms, the collapse has been rocking the already shaky trust regulators had for the crypto market. U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren, Tina Smith, and Richard Durbin recently wrote to Fidelity Investments to reconsider their plans to introduce Bitcoin exposure to workplace retirement plans it manages.</p>



<p><em>“The recent implosion of FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange, has made it abundantly clear the digital asset industry has serious problems,” the Senators said. </em></p>



<p>Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-treasurys-yellen-more-effective-oversight-needed-crypto-markets-2022-11-16/">stated</a> that the failure of FTX and its impact on crypto investors &#8220;demonstrates the need for more effective oversight of cryptocurrency markets.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Cardano ecosystem continues to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-centered-stablecoin-djed-set-to-debut-in-january-ada-poised-for-rapid-adoption/">roll out innovations</a> that will play a major role in its development in 2023. One such innovation is Carp, a new Cardano SQL indexer and replacement for dbSync.</p>



<p>The tool released by product-based blockchain company dcSpark allows anyone to run a local price indexer for Cardano native assets. According to dcSpark, the tool does this entirely from on-chain data and does not require a third-party API. In its announcement, dcSpark describes Carp as:</p>



<p><em>&#8220;A super fast, super flexible indexer for Cardano that now supports indexing the top DEXs too! Can&#8217;t wait to see what you all build with this, and which other DEXs may be added next.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Sebastien Guillemot, CTO and co-founder of dcSpark, added that the tool is free to use as it does not require an API. The indexer, built using funding from Cardano grants program Project Catalyst, already supports three Cardano decentralized exchanges. These include Minswap, Wingriders, and SundaeSwap.</p>



<h2 id="h-cardano-community-turn-attention-to-upcoming-voltaire-upgrades"><strong>Cardano community turn attention to upcoming Voltaire upgrades</strong></h2>



<p>While Carp has already launched, Cardano has several other innovations that the community is weighing in on. JCRYPTO, a Cardano-focused educational podcast, has taken to explaining the Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) that will be the cornerstone of the Voltaire upgrade planned for 2023, CIP-1694.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The CIP will introduce a mechanism for on-chain governance that will be a precursor to the transition to the Voltaire phase in Cardano. The CIP was developed by IOG CEO Charles Hoskinson and is currently undergoing voting after being proposed by developer Jared Cordouan in late November.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Hoskinson has commended the podcast for its effort to understand the CIP. He further encouraged the Cardano community to read the CIP and share their opinion.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Glad to see the community going through this. I&#8217;d encourage everyone in Cardano to do readings of the CIP and share your opinions both pro and con,&#8221; he wrote in a tweet.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>The Voltaire upgrade is billed to move Cardano to adopt decentralized governance fully at the protocol level. Hoskinson had previously noted that the Voltaire upgrade would put Cardano far ahead of the competition.</p>



<p>Additionally, Cardano continues work on other projects, including Hydra and Mithril, that will bring massive scaling benefits to Cardano. Currently, Cardano is the most <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-reigns-as-the-most-developed-crypto-asset-as-ada-leaps-forward/">actively developed blockchain</a> network going by the number of significant submissions on its GitHub repository.</p>

<p>The Department of Treasury, the Australian Government ministerial department responsible for economic policy, fiscal policy, market regulation, and budgeting, announced that the country will introduce stricter rules for crypto in early 2023.</p>



<p>Minister in charge of the Treasury, Jim Chalmers, said in a press release that Australia&#8217;s government under Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is taking action to improve the regulation of crypto service providers. </p>



<p>However, Chalmers clarified that the legislation will only be introduced after the government completes its ongoing &#8216;token mapping.&#8217; The process involves uncovering the characteristics of all digital asset tokens in Australia, including charting the type of crypto asset, its underlying code, and any other defining technological feature.</p>



<p>Australia has been carrying out the process since August this year and has plans to release a consultation paper in early 2023. The mapping will inform the government of what financial service laws should regulate digital assets. It will also guide the development of appropriate custody and licensing policies to safeguard consumers, according to Chalmers.</p>



<p>The crypto regulations plans are part of broader financial sector reforms the Australian Government has lined up. The press release reveals that the government has plans to update and strengthen Australia’s payments system.</p>



<p>It will also strengthen financial market infrastructure and establish a regulatory framework for &#8216;Buy Now Pay Later.&#8217; According to the Treasury minister, Australia fell behind in financial regulations in these sectors due to the negligence and failed promises of the previous government.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Unfortunately, our regulatory architecture has not kept pace with changes in the market. In many areas, the previous government sat on its hands. In other areas, it made announcements but didn’t deliver,&#8221; the release stated.</em></p>



<h2 id="h-australia-is-still-ramping-up-its-cbdc-plans"><strong>Australia is still ramping up its CBDC plans</strong></h2>



<p>The government of Australia has also not given up its plans to introduce a digital version of its currency, the Australian Dollar. In a consultation paper the Treasury published this month, the ministry stated that the central bank digital currency (CBDC) is part of its strategic plan for the payments system.</p>



<p>The consultation paper posed questions about the policy rationale for an Australian CBDC. These include investigating the economic, legal, regulatory, and technological considerations associated with an Australian CBDC.</p>



<p>The paper revealed that channels for public input on the matter are open till February 2023. The Australian central bank adds that it intends to conduct a pilot test of the CBDC early next year.</p>

<p>The case between Ripple Labs Inc. and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continues to wrap up. In a new joint motion, both parties filed for an extension to file Daubert Motions until Jan. 13, 2023. The extension will also affect the filing accompanying redacted exhibits on the public docket.</p>



<p>Attorney James K. Filan, an XRP community member, first shared the filing. He notes that the court has already granted the motion. He also adds that the filing comes on the back of the court&#8217;s Dec. 19 sealing ruling.</p>



<p>The Daubert motion is a type of motion that seeks to exclude the presence of an expert&#8217;s testimony to a jury. In this case, it aims to protect third parties&#8217; confidential and legitimate privacy interests.</p>



<p>The sealing ruling saw <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-army-eager-to-receive-verdict-on-ripple-vs-sec-lawsuit-as-attorney-sets-tentative-settlement-date/">Ripple</a> score another minor win in the case. The court granted the company&#8217;s request to redact documents submitted in connection with the Daubert Motions. In particular, Ripple was permitted to redact case documents submitted by MoneyGram and &#8220;third party A&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>



<p>MoneyGram, formerly a Ripple partner, requested to redact the deposition transcript of one of its officers. Third-party A&#8217;s refer to non-parties subpoenaed for documents and testimony in the lawsuit. These parties requested the redaction of seven documents to which Ripple has consented.</p>



<p>In contrast, the SEC had a minor loss in the ruling. The regulator&#8217;s motion was granted and denied in part. The court denied the SEC&#8217;s request to redact the names of the consulting firms that assisted its expert witnesses. However, it granted its request to redact documents and exhibits submitted in connection with the Daubert motions.</p>



<h2 id="h-experts-still-expect-the-case-to-end-around-march-2023"><strong>Experts still expect the case to end around March 2023</strong></h2>



<p>The SEC vs Ripple case just clocked two years since it began in Dec. 2020. However, experts like Attorney Filan, who have followed the case, expect to see a dispute resolution soon.</p>



<p>Filan predicted in November that District Judge Annalisa Torres would make her ruling on all pending issues in the case on or before March 31, 2023. This ruling will include both the expert motion and the summary judgment.</p>



<p>For its part, Ripple expects to receive a favourable ruling in the case. The blockchain-based fintech company has reiterated severally that it <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-ripple-continues-to-exude-confidence-of-scoring-major-win-against-the-sec/">is confident</a> in its arguments in the case. At present, the embattled XRP token trades at $0.35, up 2.49% in the last 24 hours.</p>

<p>The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) released its 2022 Annual Report following approval by its voting members on December 16, 2022. According to the report, digital assets were amongst the vulnerabilities identified within the United States (U.S.) financial system.</p>



<p>The FSOC is a federal government organization charged with identifying risks to the financial stability of the United States, promoting market discipline by eliminating expectations on the part of shareholders, creditors, and counterparties of such companies that the U.S. government will shield them from losses in the event of failure, and for responding to emerging threats to the stability of its financial system.</p>



<p>An October 2022 FSOC Report on <em>“Digital Asset Financial Stability Risks and Regulation” found that financial stability vulnerabilities with respect to digital assets arose firstly from the interconnections between the digital asset ecosystem and the traditional financial system and secondly from the digital asset ecosystem. The report recommended that members continue to enforce existing laws by applying following the principle of “same activity, same risk, same regulatory outcome”.</em></p>



<p>The FSOC 2022 Annual Report identified gaps in the regulation of crypto-asset activities within the U.S. and made recommendations to address the gaps.</p>



<p>The first gap that the annual report noted was that the spot markets for crypto-assets that are not securities were subject to limited direct federal regulation. The council recommended that Congress pass legislation that provides for explicit rulemaking authority for federal financial regulators over the spot market for crypto-assets that are not securities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second gap identified was that crypto-asset market businesses did not have a consistent or comprehensive regulatory framework and could engage in regulatory arbitrage. To reduce the risk of regulatory arbitrage, the Council recommended continued coordination, legislation addressing the risks posed by stablecoins, legislation relating to regulators’ authorities to have visibility into and supervise the activities of all of the affiliates and subsidiaries of crypto-asset entities, and appropriate service provider regulation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The third gap identified was that a number of crypto-asset trading platforms have proposed offering retail customers direct access to markets by vertically integrating the services provided by intermediaries such as broker-dealers or futures commission merchants. The Council recommended that member agencies assess the impact of potential vertical integration by crypto-asset firms.</p>



<p>Finally, the Council recommended that Council members continue to build capacities related to data and the analysis, monitoring, supervision, and regulation of crypto-asset activities.</p>



<p>Crypto asset prices have declined in 2022, with the total crypto market cap dropping from a US$ 2.3 trillion at the start of the year to around US$ 900 million, as at press time. A number of crypto companies have also wound down, with FTX making the news headlines when it filed for bankruptcy in November 2022. The crypto events of 2022 are likely to have a significant impact on the future of crypto.</p>

<p>Binance’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Rohit Wad considers India a hub of web3 innovations, and he plans to hire technology professionals from its top universities. In an interview with Businessline, Wad mentioned Mumbai among the cities where it plans to select new talents.</p>



<p><em>“There is going to be a tremendous boom, in the innovation that comes out of India. In fact, as a beginning step, I would like to see if we can find interns in India and get them bootstrapped on crypto,” he said.</em></p>



<p>Binance is also looking to invest in Indian web3 startups. Without naming the probable candidates on its investment radar, the Binance CTO revealed that the company might look at a couple of Indian startups for this purpose in the near future.</p>



<p>Wad plans to induct new interns from the list of cities, including Toronto, Vancouver, and Mumbai. As Binance is a remote-first company, hiring from different global tech hubs works fine with its work-from-home employment model.</p>



<p>Binance is set to hire India’s tech institutes and universities, mainly from Mumbai, which, according to Wad, is among the top global tech incubation hubs.</p>



<p>Wad disclosed that Binance has keenly watched the Indian blockchain ecosystem and has identified some promising startups and entrepreneurs. As far as Binance is concerned, its primary goal would be to build a vibrant community of developers and coders interested in learning more about decentralized technologies, as India has a lot to offer regarding technical skills and knowledge.</p>



<p>Wad’s interest in India’s tech talents comes close on the heels of a recent survey by Nasscom, and a web3 venture capital fund that said India, with its huge talent pool, is <a href="https://zycrypto.com/india-with-huge-talent-pool-set-to-play-key-role-in-global-web3-push-study/">all set to play a key role</a> in global web3 transformation.</p>



<p>Binance CEO Chengpang Zhao (CZ) twice pointed out India’s high taxation for the cryptocurrency sector in about a fortnight. First, he talked about it at Singapore Fintech Festival, where he said <a href="https://zycrypto.com/heavy-taxation-could-kill-indias-cryptocurrency-market-binance-ceo-warns/">high taxes would kill</a> the crypto industry in India. On November 17, he said India’s crypto trade market is unviable due to high taxation. Given this, Binance does not plan anything big for the Indian market right now, he clarified.</p>



<p>However, CZ mentioned that Binance, which is available to Indian users, is engaged with prominent crypto industry players and influencers to put its logic before the Indian policymakers.</p>

<p>According to Fabio Panetta, a Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank (ECB), solid foundations for the broader digital finance ecosystem are needed to harness the possibilities of digital technologies, and that regulation alone will not be enough to address the shortcomings of cryptos.</p>



<p>Panetta said that a risk-free and dependable digital settlement asset provided by central bank money and new technologies for wholesale settlement are some of the areas the ECB is exploring. Panetta was speaking at the Insight Summit held at the London Business School on December 7, 2022.</p>



<p>Panetta is sceptical that crypto technology can replace regulated intermediaries. He further said that unbacked crypto-assets were too volatile, offered no benefits to society, transactions inefficient, did not fund consumption or investment and played no part in combating climate change.</p>



<p>Panetta referred to investors who had suffered significant losses from the crypto collapse and could not be compensated as there were no insurance schemes. He also pointed out that stablecoins are exposed to runs.</p>



<p>To mitigate crypto risks while harnessing the innovative potential of digital finance beyond cryptos, Panetta said that what is required is a timely, global regulatory framework for crypto-assets to primarily prevent crypto-assets from circumventing financial regulation. This should be followed by shielding the mainstream financial system by segregating crypto-related activities of supervised intermediaries.</p>



<p>Panetta emphasised that digital finance, like other forms of finance, requires an anchor of stability in the form of a risk-free digital asset. He said that the regulation of crypto activities would have to be adapted to the continuous evolution of crypto risks. He called for regulators, overseers, and supervisors to be empowered to adjust their instruments to keep pace with market and technological developments.</p>



<p>Panetta advised authorities to address the social risks associated with crypto-assets, such as tax evasion, illicit activities, and their environmental impact. He called for harmonisation of the taxation of crypto-assets across jurisdictions.</p>



<p>Panetta concluded that regulation would not turn risky instruments into safe money. He, however, said that a stable digital finance ecosystem requires well-supervised intermediaries and a risk-free and dependable digital settlement asset, which only digital central bank money can provide.</p>



<p>The European Union (EU) is already working on a comprehensive framework for crypto assets through the markets in crypto-assets (MiCA) regulation. MiCA aims to harmonise rules for crypto-assets within the EU. MiCA will also provide legal certainty for crypto-assets not covered by existing EU legislation and subject stablecoin issuers of e-money tokens and asset-referenced tokens to licensing and supervision.</p>

<ul>
<li>Retail investors&#8217; Bitcoin holdings hit an all-time high, according to a new report from Glassnode.</li>



<li>The group&#8217;s total Bitcoin ownership now stands at 17% of the total supply, a 5% growth from its 12% figure in 2020.</li>



<li>Although current statistics from the report show that Bitcoin ownership is largely decentralized, critics argue that the survey did not account for wrapped and lost Bitcoin.</li>
</ul>



<p>A new report released by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode shows that retail investors are doubling down on their <a href="https://zycrypto.com/still-bullish-billionaire-money-manager-bill-miller-maintains-view-bitcoin-will-rise-again-despite-ftx-chaos/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> investments despite the recent bearish trend.</p>



<p>According to the report, retail investors&#8217; BTC ownership is now at an all-time high of 17% of the total supply showing significant growth over the years. Retail BTC ownership has grown exponentially since 2011, with several periods of rapid growth, including the late 2014 bull market and 2017.</p>



<p>In 2020, the figure stood at 12% of the total supply showing a 5% growth in two years. Glassnode classifies retail investors as wallets holding less than 10 BTC in exchanges currently at $168,300.</p>



<p>With this new report, experts say that the asset is headed in the right direction. Blockchain expert Will Clemente lauded the performance of BTC in the last 12 years, although he believes it is not yet perfect.</p>



<p><em>“Not perfect yet, but solid for a 12-year-old asset and definitely trending in the right direction. Bitcoin&#8217;s supply disperses over time, while fiat&#8217;s holder base concentrates to whales over time.”</em></p>



<p>Blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock also confirmed the report with data showing that holders of 0-10 BTC stand at 17%. An increase in the total holding of retail investors shows a growth in the adoption of BTC rather than other narratives, such as distrust from institutional investors.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-btc-holdings-getting-more-decentralized"><strong>Are BTC holdings getting more decentralized?</strong></h2>



<p>Whales have been a significant part of every digital asset, opening up the decentralization debate. Over the years, data shows that BTC holdings are slowly becoming more spread across all categories of holders.</p>



<p>Data from IntoTheBlock show that wallets with 100 BTC are having a declining market share from 69.5% in 2013 to 59.8% today. BTC is also more decentralized than other top cryptocurrencies. About 38% of Ethereum (ETH) and 64% of Dogecoin (DOGE) are held by addresses with 0.1% of total supply compared to BTC with 9%.</p>



<p>Critics have pointed to the fact that the recent statistics do not include lost BTC, wrapped BTC signifying that it may not be as decentralized as portrayed.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ethereum’s co-founder Vitalik Buterin says Ripple is a centralized entity against claims that they are more decentralized.</li>



<li>Ripple’s CTO David Schwartz hits back at Buterin, saying he has no grasp of the relationship between Ripple, XRP, and XRPL.</li>



<li>Users hold mixed views of Ripple’s decentralization claims following the company’s explanation in its Q3 reports.</li>
</ul>



<p>Vitalik Buterin has come after <a href="https://zycrypto.com/garlinghouse-shakes-off-secs-antics-towards-ripple-and-xrp-wants-answer-on-the-legal-status-of-ether/">Ripple and XRP</a> and, this time hits the structure and tokenomics of its XRP with strong claims of centralization.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with Bankless on Monday, he stated that Ripple is “<em>still completely centralized</em>” against claims that the company is now more decentralized following criticisms.</p>



<p>“<em>A project in the crypto space needs to have some kind of chain data structure somewhere,” </em>he continued.</p>



<p>Still, on the rift, he said that the company is yet to apologize for its statements to the US government that China controls Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC).</p>



<p>“<em>XRP has not apologized for claiming that Bitcoin and Ethereum are Chinese-controlled.”</em></p>



<p>The comments from Buterin have drawn the reaction of the Chief Technology Officer of Ripple,<em> David Schwartz,</em> who took to Twitter to <a href="https://twitter.com/joelkatz/status/1604947261242212357?s=21&amp;t=2R7zQDol4kmUZzbudABSlA">say</a> that Buterin “<em>still doesn’t understand, or is pretending not to understand, that Ripple is a company and XRP is a digital asset.”</em></p>



<p>Buterin is among the critics that argue that the excessive control Ripple Labs has over XRP points to centralization. Ripple’s community has come after Ethereum with claims of corruption as the reason it has an easy pass with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>



<p>After Ripple called ETH and BTC, Chinese-controlled assets, Buterin replied that XRP has lost the right of protection from the digital asset community because of such wild claims.</p>



<h2 id="h-ripple-s-decentralization-claims"><strong>Ripple’s decentralization claims</strong></h2>



<p>In the past, users have criticized the way Ripple Labs have controlled the XRP token, with several investors even confusing them as the same. The company explained that Ripple is a digital asset payment platform leveraging blockchain technology for institutions, while XRP is the native token of the XRP Ledger (XRPL).</p>



<p>To show its decentralization, the company has released data showing that it only controls 4 out of the 130 validators of XRPL. Ripple stated earlier this year that XRPL is “<em>based on an inherently decentralized, democratic, consensus mechanism — which no one party can control.”</em></p>



<p>Ripple, in their third-quarter earnings <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripples-2022-q3-report-highlighting-achievements-amid-plunging-markets/">report</a>, revealed that for the first time, the company’s XRP holdings have dropped below 50% of the total supply after it faced criticisms earlier in the year.</p>

<p>Following his extradition from Bahamas prisons, disgraced FTX boss <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ftxs-sam-bankman-fried-accepts-extradition-to-the-us-after-deadlock/">Sam Bankman-Fried</a> made his first appearance yesterday at the New York Southern District, where he was served a $250 million bail option and made to pledge a commitment to house arrest, travel ban and intense scrutiny at his parent&#8217;s house.</p>



<p>Other restrictions include a transaction limit of $1000, a ban on using or possessing firearms, access to credit, business set-up, and close monitoring of substance abuse.</p>



<p>Charges laid before the son of two MIT Professors, Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, include wire fraud, money laundering, camp fund breach, and conspiracy, even as the entire family has come under scrutiny for their role in the billion-dollar crime.</p>



<p>Sam, 30, who is believed to have stolen approximately $4 billion and plunged over 50 top creditors into debt, reportedly broke the record for the largest pre-trial bond ever issued, reflecting the magnitude of his crimes which has been labelled everything from <em>a relapse of Enron</em>&#8216; to <em>a fraud of epic proportions</em> altogether.</p>



<h2 id="h-friends-plead-guilty"><strong>Friends Plead Guilty</strong></h2>



<p>FTX Co-founder Gary Wang and Caroline Ellison, the former CEO of FTX&#8217;s funnel company, Alameda, both pleaded guilty on Thursday to fraud charges and have vowed to cooperate with the authorities to uncover the depth of Sam&#8217;s despicable fraud.</p>



<p>The details of the charges accuse Gary of creating software to illegally funnel funds from FTX to Alameda, Ellison of tampering with trading stolen funds for leveraged trading, and both parties conspiring to hide illicit activities from investors and auditors.</p>



<p>Even with numerous accounting discrepancies widely publicized by CoinDesk last month, the duo was quick to dismiss the discovery as only a portion —and not aĺl— of the company&#8217;s balance sheet at a time when Alameda was technically insolvent.</p>



<h2 id="h-looming-conviction"><strong>Looming Conviction</strong></h2>



<p>Just how long could Sam spend in prison? Anywhere from a few decades to over a hundred years, going by the federal statute, which stipulates 20 years for a single count of wire fraud. Sam has up to six count charges.</p>



<p>Last week, the SEC, in a separate charge on the former poster boy for crypto, declared that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-ceo-cz-calls-sam-bankman-fried-a-fraudster-reveals-the-real-reason-behind-ftx-crash/">Sam had defrauded</a> over 90 US investors, concealed his motives and actions, and lavished billions of customer&#8217;s funds on personal expenditures.</p>



<p>It would be a sour and busy festive season for the Bankman-Fried family as they prepare a compelling defence all week in the run-up to the next hearing slated for 2023.</p>

<p>In his speech on November 21, 2022, on the topic “Reflections on DeFi, digital currencies and regulation”, at Warwick Business School&#8217;s Gilmore Centre Policy Forum Conference on DeFi &amp; Digital Currencies,  the Bank of England’s Deputy Governor for Financial Stability, Sir Jon Cunliffe, said that the general themes of corporate governance, and the quality of collateral in regulated and supervised conventional financial firms do apply to the crypto world.</p>



<p>Sir Cunliffe mentioned that bringing the activities of the crypto world within the relevant regulatory frameworks provides several benefits that include the protection of consumers/investors, protection against financial stability risk, and fostering of innovation of new technology. </p>



<p>Sir Cunliffe further stressed the need to continue the inclusion of crypto financial service activities and the entities within the existing regulatory framework under the guiding principle of ‘same risk, same regulatory outcome’.</p>



<p>Sir Cunliffe said that the central bank is actively exploring the issuance of a digitally native Pound Sterling. With the current trends marked by a reducing role of cash and an increasingly digital economy that comes with new forms of tokenised money, a digital pound that is robust and interchangeable without loss of value may be needed in future. He also noted that a digital pound could provide a settlement asset to a wide variety of private sector innovators and developers of payment services.</p>



<p>Sir Cunliffe said that a consultative report should be issued around the end of this year setting out the next steps on the issuance of a digitally native pound sterling by the Bank of England.</p>



<p>On November 15, 2022, before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, in Washington, D.C., the US Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision, Michael S. Barr, said: <em>“We do not want to stifle innovation, but when regulation is lax or behind the curve, it can facilitate risk taking and a race to the bottom that puts consumers, businesses, and the economy in danger and discredits new products and services with consumers and investors. I believe everyone has a stake in getting the regulatory balance right”.</em></p>



<p>Barr further said that crypto-asset-related activity requires effective oversight that includes safeguards to ensure that crypto companies are subject to similar regulatory safeguards as other financial services providers.</p>



<p>As to whether crypto is regulated under an existing or a separate legal and regulatory framework, the recent events during the dramatic collapse of the FTX exchange further enhance the calls for faster and more effective crypto regulatory frameworks.</p>

<ul>
<li>The testnet is currently undergoing an audit to remove bugs and possible vulnerabilities.</li>



<li>Polygon zkEVM is touted as the highest level of scalability for Ethereum.</li>
</ul>



<p>Polygon launched the last testnet before the rollout of the zkEVM scalability solution, which bundles transactions to increase speed and reduce gas fees. The layer-2 network has also announced an audit of the platform.</p>



<p>&#8220;<em>Researchers at Polygon are introducing the pioneering use of recursion in a zkEVM, resulting in batch aggregation. In addition, an optimized prover now generates proofs for a batch in under 4 minutes (down from 10,)</em>&#8221; the company wrote on its official website.</p>



<p>The testnet has incorporated all the required features of zkEVM for the final deployment. It enables Polygon zkEVM to confirm a batch of ZK proofs – where each will track multiple transactions. According to the announcement, bundling many transactions into a single proof is the top level of scalability with equivalence to the EVM.</p>



<h2 id="h-zkevm-public-testnet-milestone-and-its-relevance-in-defi"><strong>ZkEVM Public Testnet Milestone And Its Relevance In DeFi</strong></h2>



<p>Termed the ‘holy grail’ of scalability, Polygon <a href="https://zycrypto.com/matic-primed-for-huge-shakeup-as-polygon-records-huge-milestone-for-ethereum-scaling-with-zkevm/">announced zkEVM</a> public testnet on October 10, 2022. The testnet, according to the developers, has attracted interest from notable EVM-based DeFi protocols like Aave.</p>



<p>While launching the testnet, the layer 2 network said integrating Zero-Knowledge proofs with Ethereum Virtual Machine was the most challenging step. It noted that testnet could prove that zkEVM generates ZK proofs within its EVM-equivalent environment.</p>



<p>During the launch, Polygon added that it needed to achieve the top level of EVM compatibility to reach type-2 EVM compatibility, where Polygon zkEVM would be like Ethereum from within. Currently, the scalability upgrade is limited in speed and capacity.</p>



<p>Polygon says the public testnet would enable it to &#8220;<em>debug, stabilize, and get ready for audits before the mainnet launch.</em>&#8220;</p>



<p>ZkEVM is a layer 2 construction on Ethereum that addresses scalability with mass transfers merged into a single transaction. The platform&#8221; <em>records the validity and correctness of bundled transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.</em>&#8221; In addition, the blockchain enhances the network&#8217;s speed by keeping only the transfer&#8217;s proofs and the bundled data.</p>
