The international entity emphasizes that nations should confront the risks cryptocurrencies pose to global financial stability. The FSB contends that occurrences within the preceding year have underscored the “structural vulnerabilities of crypto assets and related players.”</strong></p>
<h2>G20’s Financial Stability Board Provides 9 Crypto Industry-Centric Recommendations for Countries and Standard-Setting Bodies</h2>
<p>As stated in a newly published <a href="https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P170723-1.pdf">report</a>, the G20’s Financial Stability Board (FSB) wants to rein in the crypto industry with tighter regulations and standardized frameworks. The FSB&#8217;s strategy for governing crypto asset operations hinges on encouraging collaboration between jurisdictional financial authorities and standard-setting bodies (SSBs). This cooperation aims to guarantee that such activities are governed by sturdy regulation and oversight matching the financial stability risks they pose, all while fostering responsible innovation.</p>
<p>The FSB has identified several notable failures within the crypto industry over the previous year, including the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/a-dark-day-for-crypto-a-deep-dive-into-the-obliterated-terra-token-ecosystem-and-damaged-apps/">depegging event</a> of Terra&#8217;s stablecoin and the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/from-a-32-billion-valuation-to-financial-troubles-an-in-depth-look-at-the-rise-and-fall-of-ftx/">implosion of FTX</a>. “These events demonstrate interlinkages between crypto asset markets and the traditional financial system,” the authors of the FSB report outline. Nevertheless, the regulatory authority concedes that the impact on conventional finance was &#8220;limited&#8221; amid these two distinct incidents. Still, “interlinkages and possible spillovers between the crypto asset and traditional financial systems could markedly increase,” the FSB report explains.</p>
<p>The FSB further states:</p>
<blockquote><p>These events have further highlighted that many crypto asset activities involve economic functions similar to those in traditional finance and should be comprehensively regulated and/or brought into compliance with new or existing rules as appropriate.</p></blockquote>

<p>The FSB’s nine outlined recommendations stress that regulatory structures must also mandate that any crypto asset activities aiming to execute a similar economic role as those in the conventional financial system, are subject to identical or equivalent regulation. This should hold true regardless of how these crypto asset activities are carried out or the manner in which they are promoted, the report emphasizes. The FSB is of the opinion that the recommendations provide sufficient latitude for SSBs to formulate detailed standards tackling crypto sector-specific issues within their individual jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The FSB says the main concern is to “safeguard client assets,” remove “conflicts of interest,” from the sector, and establish “cross-border cooperation.” The FSB and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) &#8220;will deliver a joint report to the G20 in September 2023, which will synthesise the policy findings from IMF work on macroeconomic and monetary issues,” the FSB report concludes.</p>

Aave users can now mint the stablecoin asset by leveraging Aave version three (v3).</strong></p>
<h2>Aave&#8217;s Dollar-Pegged GHO Token Goes Live on Ethereum</h2>
<p>This week, on July 14, 2023, Aave&#8217;s community approved a <a href="https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=268">governance proposal</a>, swiftly followed by the much-awaited launch of the stablecoin GHO on the Ethereum network. GHO, initially <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/aave-dao-approves-the-launch-of-a-collateral-backed-stablecoin-called-gho/">announced</a> in July 2022, had a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/aave-launches-stablecoin-gho-on-ethereum-goerli-testnet-with-open-source-codebase-and-audits/">test run</a> on Ethereum&#8217;s Goerli testnet in February 2023. In line with the information from the Github repository, the newly debuted stablecoin, and its affiliated smart contract underwent <a href="https://github.com/aave/gho-core/tree/main/audits">multiple audits</a>.</p>
<p>Currently, GHO is relatively insignificant when compared with the top ten heavyweights of the stablecoin world, especially when considering circulating dollar-pegged coins. The circulating supply of GHO stands around <a href="https://archive.ph/gh5xm">2,510,269 tokens</a>, representing a meager 0.0016% of the overall $127 billion stablecoin economy. At 12:20 p.m. Eastern Time on Sunday, GHO hit a trough at $0.9813, yet so far, it has generally maintained its peg to the dollar.</p>

<p>Emulating numerous stablecoin assets, individuals can gather interest with Aave&#8217;s freshly debuted GHO stablecoin. Users who stake the AAVE token are also rewarded with an extra 30% discount on current GHO borrowing rates. Thus far, there are approximately 234 GHO holders, and since the mainnet inception, a total of 893 transactions have been logged. <a href="https://archive.ph/D8OZG">Data</a> sourced from coinmarketcap.com reveals that GHO has seen roughly $1,437,756 in worldwide trading volume over the past 24 hours.</p>

Data illustrates an intensified dedication of hashrate to the Litecoin blockchain as the critical halving deadline draws near.</strong></p>
<h2>Litecoin Reward Halving Draws Near</h2>
<p>Over the last two weeks, <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC/">litecoin (LTC)</a> has seen a notable descent, depreciating approximately 17% in value against the U.S. dollar. However, casting the gaze back a full month reveals a contrasting picture, with <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a> capturing a gain of roughly 18%. In just 15 days, the Litecoin network stands on the precipice of its third halving.</p>
<p>History shows us a pattern with the first two reward reductions taking place on August 25, 2015, and August 5, 2019, respectively. This forthcoming third halving is set to shrink the miners&#x2019; rewards from a substantial 12.5 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a> per block to a more modest 6.25 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>. In contrast to Bitcoin&#x2019;s average block interval, which aims to clock in at ten minutes per block, Litecoin operates at a swifter pace, producing a new block every 2.5 minutes.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, factoring in current <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a> exchange rates, a single block rewards miners with $1,161 derived from the freshly minted 12.5 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>. If the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>&#x2019;s price manages to maintain the same exchange rate, a block mined post-August 2, 2023, can anticipate a value of around $580. The price upswing of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a> over the recent 30-day span has sparked substantial interest, luring an abundance of Scrypt hashrate.</p>

<p>Litecoin&#x2019;s hashrate dramatically peaked on July 4, 2023, reaching a record high of 1.03 petahash per second (PH/s) at block height 2,503,485. This indicates an unprecedented level of activity on the network. At present, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>&#x2019;s total hashrate is coasting along at <a href="https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/litecoin/hashrate-chart">804</a> terahash per second (TH/s).</p>
<p class="p1"></p>
<p>In the mining industry, Litecoin&#x2019;s application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) mining devices are currently staking a claim as some of the market&#x2019;s most profitable machinery. For instance, a mining rig delivering 8.8 gigahash per second (GH/s) can amass an estimated daily profit of $7.83. Moreover, a machine operating at 9.5 GH/s could garner a slightly higher daily earning of $9.24.</p>

Initially, at a mere 2% to 5% in late June, the disparity sharply soared to an astonishing 16% by mid-July. Even though bitcoin lingered just above $30,000 on Monday, its valuation on Binance US is roughly $5,000 lower than the worldwide average in relation to the USD pair.</strong></p>
<h2>USD Trading Pairs on Binance US Show Significant Disparities</h2>
<p>At the week&#x2019;s start, the digital economy suffered a downturn with a 1.22% drop in value, reducing it to $1.2 trillion. Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) maintains a trading value of around <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230717124934/https://coinmarketcap.com/">$30,180</a> per unit, while ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) is roughly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230717124934/https://coinmarketcap.com/">$1,911</a> per coin. However, the price divergence across <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>, and select other coins exclusively paired with the U.S. dollar on Binance US &#x2014; a prominent crypto exchange &#x2014; continues to expand.</p>
<p>As per <a href="https://archive.ph/glZLe#selection-1517.0-1517.4">July 17 data</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD trading illustrates <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> transactions at a starkly lower rate of $25,073 &#x2014; a staggering 16.92% below the global mean exchange rate for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. Similar inconsistencies in Binance US&#x2019; exchange rates are apparent for the majority of cryptocurrency assets and stablecoins when matched with the U.S. dollar. For instance, ether, now trading above $1,900 per unit, remarkably drops to around $1,595 on Binance US when paired with the greenback.</p>

<p>Concurrently, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>/USD pairs exhibit a rate of $0.76 per tether on this platform &#x2014; significantly lower than its anticipated dollar-pegged value. Likewise, binance coin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a>), despite its market value of $242 per coin, exchanges for a mere $200 when compared against the dollar on Binance US. Over the past fortnight, disparities within Binance US have further deepened; by the end of June, exchange rate variances spanned between <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-28/crypto-discounts-worsen-on-binance-us-as-sec-investigation-s-impact-takes-hold?leadSource=uverify%20wall">2% and 5%</a>.</p>

<p>As July commenced, the gap between U.S. dollar matches and global exchange rates <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-us-arbitrage-social-media-users-say-btc-discount-not-indication-of-an-opportunity/">widened considerably</a>. The cause behind Binance US&#x2019; current pricing discrepancies stems from the platform&#x2019;s suspension of USD deposits, resulting in customers being unable to top up their accounts with fresh dollars. The residual dollars on the exchange, since Binance US halted deposits, triggered the pricing irregularities, as traders sell coins at broad discounts. The duration and extent to which these disparities will persist remain uncertain.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) narrowly avoided a drop below the $30,000 level on Monday, as market sentiment remained uncertain following recent gains.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD slipped to an intraday low of $30,045.23 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, which comes a day after peaking at $30,437.56.</p>
<p>Some expected prices to drop this week, after last week&#x2019;s rally pushed volumes deep into overbought territory.</p>

<p>The relative strength index (RSI), which reached a high of 66.00 last week, now sits at the 52.85 mark.</p>
<p>This is marginally above a floor at 52.00, which seems to have been the last line of defense preventing <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> from falling under $30,000.</p>
<p>As of writing, bitcoin is trading at $30,201.14.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) also moved lower on Monday, however traders were once again able to prevent price from dropping below the $1,900 level.</p>
<p>Following a high of $1,942.03 during Sunday&#x2019;s session, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD dropped to a bottom of $1,901.06 to start the week.</p>
<p>This resulted in the world&#x2019;s second largest cryptocurrency falling lower for a fourth consecutive day.</p>

<p>Since reaching a multi-month high at $2,029, sellers and profit takers have moved to push price lower.</p>
<p>Similar to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, this was due to price strength being overbought, with a reading above the 70.00 mark. However, it now sits at 52.94.</p>
<p>The next visible floor appears to be at 50.00, and should it reach this point, ethereum will likely be trading below $1,900.</p>

Specifically, the blockchain analytics firm explained that crypto inflows to known illicit entities are down 65% compared to the previous year while inflows to risky entities are down 42%.</strong></p>
<h2>Crypto Crime Down &#8216;Significantly&#8217; This Year</h2>
<p>Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis released its mid-year update on cryptocurrency-related crime on Wednesday. Noting that crypto crime is down 65% overall, the firm wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our data shows that cryptocurrency-related crime is down significantly this year.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Through the end of June, crypto inflows to known illicit entities — not including inflows to entities that have been sanctioned or subject to special measures — are down 65% compared to where they were at the same time in 2022,” Chainalysis detailed.</p>
<p>In addition, “Inflows to risky entities (made up primarily of mixers and high-risk exchanges) are down 42%” and “Inflows to illicit addresses are down in nearly every category,&#8221; the firm noted.</p>
<p>While crypto crime is down substantially overall, the blockchain analytics firm pointed out that ransomware was the sole type of cryptocurrency-related crime projected to grow in 2023, as attackers have extorted an additional $175.8 million more than they did during the same time period last year.</p>

<p>Moreover, crypto scammers have experienced a significant drop in revenue compared to the previous year, with their total collections in 2023 through June being approximately $3.3 billion less than in 2022. Noting that their total earnings for the current year amounted to slightly over $1 billion, Chainalysis emphasized:</p>
<blockquote><p>Through the end of June, crypto scammers have pulled in 77% less revenue than they did through June of 2022 — and keep in mind as well that 2022 itself saw a large drop in revenue compared to 2021.</p></blockquote>

Amidst this digital revolution, <a href="https://trackingjustbit.io/d6fa265fc">JustBit </a>emerges as a distinctive platform that has captivated a multitude of gamers with its extensive selection of games and flexible deposit methods.

<p><b>Casino Gameplay: Winning and Losing Explained</b></p>
<p>To comprehend why players win or lose at casinos, we need to delve into the underlying mechanisms of casino games. Casinos, including online ones like <a href="https://trackingjustbit.io/d6fa265fc">JustBit</a>, use a system called Random Number Generator (RNG) to ensure fair gameplay.</p>
<p><b>The Role of RNG in Casinos</b></p>
<p>RNG, standing for Random Number Generator, ensures a diverse array of results with every interaction in games such as slots, poker, blackjack, and roulette. The outcomes are consistently spontaneous, unaffected by any prior results, providing players with a genuinely impartial gaming encounter across websites, including <a href="https://trackingjustbit.io/d6fa265fc">JustBit</a>.</p>
<p>However, the element of randomness also implies that outcomes are mostly down to luck. While the player has a mathematical edge, it doesn&#x2019;t guarantee that the player always wins. Players may hit winning streaks or endure losing streaks, all due to the RNG mechanism. Hence, it&#x2019;s crucial for players to view casino games primarily as a form of entertainment rather than a consistent source of income.</p>
<p><b>The Influence of Strategy on Game Outcomes</b></p>
<p>In the realm of casino games, it&#x2019;s common for players to credit victories or defeats to the caprices of fortune. However, while fortune indeed plays a pivotal role in numerous casino games, it&#x2019;s crucial to understand that it&#x2019;s not the solitary determinant. For some games, implementing strategic thought and thoroughly comprehending the game&#x2019;s regulations can notably sway your prospects of clinching a victory. This thrilling intersection of expertise, planning, and probability constitutes the real allure of casino games across websites such as <a href="https://trackingjustbit.io/d6fa265fc">JustBit</a>.</p>
<p><b>Mastering the Art of Strategy in Casino Games</b></p>
<p>A number of casino games, like Blackjack and Poker, don&#x2019;t solely rely on the unpredictable hand of fate. Instead, these games open up a space for strategic decisions that can markedly impact your chances of victory. Understanding the rules of the game forms the basic foundation here. Grasping the different hand combinations in Poker or knowing when to hit, stand, or double down in Blackjack can significantly affect the game&#x2019;s outcome.</p>
<p>In addition to the rules, acquiring knowledge of basic strategies is equally critical. For instance, Blackjack strategy charts provide a mathematical breakdown of the best decisions to make based on your cards and the dealer&#x2019;s face-up card. On the other hand, in Poker, knowing when to fold and when to raise, reading your opponents&#x2019; behaviors, and managing your poker bankroll are strategies that can reduce and increase your winning potential.</p>
<p><b>The Role of Luck: A Constant Variable in Casino Games</b></p>
<p>Despite the strategic elements, it&#x2019;s important to remember that no strategy can guarantee a win in these games. The variable of luck ensures a certain level of unpredictability in every game round. This means that even the most experienced players armed with fail-proof strategies can occasionally lose to beginners.</p>
<p>These scenarios highlight the fundamental element of chance in casino games, reminding us that while strategies can significantly enhance the gameplay and boost your winning potential, they can&#x2019;t promise consistent triumphs. This unpredictability ultimately infuses these games with their sense of thrill and engagement over websites, <a href="https://trackingjustbit.io/d6fa265fc">JustBit</a> being a case in point.</p>
<p><b>Psychology&#x2019;s Impact on Casino Outcomes</b></p>
<p>When pondering over casino games, our thoughts frequently gravitate toward components such as fortune, probability, and tactical moves. Even though these elements definitively mold the casino gameplay arena, a nuanced yet potent facet carries significant weight in dictating outcomes &#x2013; the player&#x2019;s psychology. As a profound interaction of mental operations and emotional reactions, human psychology profoundly influences the actions we undertake, the choices we execute, and our responses to the results when engaged in games over web-based venues like <a href="https://trackingjustbit.io/d6fa265fc">JustBit</a>.</p>
<p><b>The Thrill of Anticipation and the Pleasure of Reward</b></p>
<p>One of the most fascinating psychological aspects at play in casino gaming is the thrill of anticipation. As players place their bets and await the outcome, an intense sense of excitement builds up. This feeling is linked to the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter in our brain associated with pleasure and reward. When we anticipate a potentially rewarding activity, such as hitting a winning combination in a slot game on <a href="https://trackingjustbit.io/d6fa265fc">JustBit</a>, our brain releases dopamine, creating feelings of enjoyment and satisfaction.</p>

<p><b>RTP (Return to Player)</b></p>
<p>The world of online casinos is fascinating, brimming with colorful graphics, exciting sounds, and the constant thrill of potential winnings. While these elements make for an engaging experience, understanding some of the key terminologies used in the industry can elevate your gaming adventure, offering you insights that could potentially help your gameplay strategy.</p>
<p>One such term is the RTP, which stands for Return to Player. Although it might sound complicated, the concept behind RTP is quite straightforward. To put it in simple terms, RTP is a measure that tells you how much a particular casino game is designed to pay back to its players over an extended period. It&#x2019;s a theoretical figure calculated based on thousands, if not millions, of game rounds.</p>
<p>Imagine you&#x2019;re playing a slot game with an RTP of 96%. This percentage indicates that over a long timeline, the game will give back 96 EUR for every 100 EUR that players put into it. However, this doesn&#x2019;t mean that if you, as an individual player, wager 100 EUR, you&#x2019;re guaranteed to receive 96 EUR back. Some players might win a jackpot, while others might get less than 96 EUR. This scenario underscores the random nature of casino games, where winning or losing primarily depends on luck.</p>
<p><b>Why RTP Matters?</b></p>
<p>Grasping the concept of RTP can substantially impact your gaming choices on platforms like <a href="https://trackingjustbit.io/d6fa265fc">JustBit</a>. Each game&#x2019;s RTP is a consideration, with a Blackjack game potentially offering over 99% RTP and certain slots offering around 95%.</p>
<p>RTP can shape your gaming approach. High RTP games might appeal to those avoiding risks, while those seeking thrill may choose lower RTP games. However, your decision shouldn&#x2019;t hinge solely on RTP. Your familiarity with the game, its enjoyment level, and volatility should also play a part.</p>
<p><b>Exploring the Exclusive Bonus Structure at Justbit</b></p>
<p>Justbit stands out with its innovative array of bonuses and promotions designed to optimize players&#x2019; potential for success. Among its impressive offerings is an industry-leading 45% cashback benefit, acting as a protective shield, enabling players to recoup a considerable proportion of their losses.

These promotional offers do more than just heighten the excitement; they prolong the duration of a player&#x2019;s gaming session, thereby amplifying the potential for victorious outcomes.</p>

Under the arrangement, an Ethiopian airliner was paid local currency equivalent to $100 million while Dangote Cement is said to have received a similar amount of nairas. </strong></p>
<h2>Ongoing U.S. Dollar Shortages</h2>
<p>The central bank of Ethiopia is reported to have performed a $100 million currency swap transaction with its Nigerian counterpart. Under the swap agreement, Ethiopia’s national airliner, which has been unable to repatriate funds trapped in Nigeria, took over the Nigeria cement company Dangote Cement’s profits which were similarly stuck in Ethiopia.</p>
<p>According to a local <a href="https://www.thereporterethiopia.com/35363/">report</a>, the two central banks resorted to the swap transaction because the arrangement obviates the need for U.S. dollars when settling. As suggested in the report, the arrangement is seemingly suitable for Ethiopia and Nigeria which both face ongoing shortages of foreign exchange.</p>
<p>As has been reported by Bitcoin.com News, the two countries are among several African states facing <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/nigerias-rising-inflation-and-foreign-exchange-shortages-fueling-devaluation-speculation-imf-mission/">persistent</a> U.S. dollar shortages. The shortages have in turn led to the growth of the foreign exchange parallel market. Attempts to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ethiopian-central-bank-restricts-the-amount-of-cash-that-should-held-by-travelers-to-and-from-the-country/">rein in</a> the parallel market by both central banks have seemingly failed to channel the flow of the greenback away from the parallel market.</p>

<p>Under the arrangement, Ethiopian Airlines, which could not retrieve about $180 million from Nigeria, will receive the local currency equivalent of $100 million from the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE). Likewise, Dangote Cement, which had over $200 million locked in Ethiopia’s financial system, would get paid nairas equivalent to $100 million by the Central Bank of Nigeria.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the unnamed sources at NBE have reportedly characterized the swap transaction as a temporary measure. Mesfin Tassew, the CEO of the Ethiopian airline, suggested that the swap agreement only applicable to the $100 million and not for the entire blocked funds.</p>

Failla called to attention the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) approval of Coinbase&#8217;s Initial Public Offering (IPO), hinting that the agency could have been more thorough. Failla expressed skepticism about the SEC&#8217;s posture that approving the Coinbase S-1 form to go public meant &#8220;nothing,&#8221; stating that the commission could have called out Coinbase&#8217;s behavior.</strong></p>
<h2>SEC v. Coinbase: Judge Failla Was Skeptical Towards Regulator&#8217;s Posture on Coinbase IPO Approval</h2>
<p>Katherine P. Failla, judge for the Southern District of New York, has called attention to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) behavior when approving the Initial Public Offering (IPO) of Coinbase to go through back in 2021. Failla hinted that the commission might have done more to signal the problems in the exchange&#8217;s business model before greenlighting its listing on Nasdaq.</p>
<p>During the pre-motion conference of the case, which took place on July 13, Failla was curious about the SEC approval of the S-1 form from Coinbase, which described its business model to the commission to be listed in public markets.</p>
<p>Failla questioned SEC attorney Peter Mancuso about this, <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/c5bd0wqjc7v0/46XloV2v8raTCNRhg8XTKZ/2a13c4bec44230bc8ae30ab37c01722e/Premotion_Conference_Tr.__7.13.23_.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stating</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there some significance that I should give, or maybe there is none, to the fact that the commission issued the S-1 and didn&#8217;t say, hey, watch out, guys, you&#8217;re engaging in securities laws violations?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mancuso stated that there was &#8220;no way&#8221; that approval of an S-1 constituted a &#8220;blessing of a company&#8217;s entire business.&#8221; However, Failla pressed the subject, expressing &#8220;skepticism&#8221; towards the SEC&#8217;s stance. She declared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You never could have said to them, hey, you guys need to register as a securities exchange. That was within the power of the SEC to do, was it not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While Mancuso explained that he could not &#8220;really speak to that,&#8221; Failla explained that nothing stopped the commission from doing it.</p>

<h2>Further Criticism</h2>
<p>The approval of Coinbase&#8217;s public offering came up again further along in the discussion, with Sullivan &amp; Cromwell&#8217;s Steven Peikin blasting the commission&#8217;s stance, stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fact is, other judges have had the exact same instinct that you have had and have said, in numerous instances, the fact that the commission reviews and authorizes a registration statement is of some legal weight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The approval of Coinbase&#8217;s IPO was signaled in one of the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-alleges-sec-lacks-any-powers-to-regulate-digital-asset-exchanges-in-recent-filing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filings</a> before this pre-motion conference as part of the exchange&#8217;s defense, stating that the commission allowed Coinbase&#8217;s shares &#8220;to be sold to millions of retail and institutional investors&#8221; and implying that the recent lawsuit contradicts this approval action, given that six of the twelve assets deemed to constitute securities by the commission were already listed on Coinbase&#8217;s trading platform at the time.</p>

Unlike existing zero knowledge blockchain protocols, QED has a novel state model which is horizontally scalable, meaning it is no longer limited by TPS restrictions that have previously prevented adoption of blockchain technologies in Web2 use cases such as social networks, traditional finance, and gaming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enabled by advances in fast recursive zero knowledge proofs, QED is able to achieve this scale without compromising security or decentralization and proves all transactions end-to-end using proof recursion (verifying a zero knowledge proof in a zero knowledge proof ). This process of decentralized recursive proving culminates in a single block proof which can be verified by an Ethereum smart contract, making the protocol only reliant on the Proof of Math itself, rather than an incentive based consensus system vulnerable to collusion, hacking and misaligned incentives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the first blockchain capable of serving billions of users in a single block, QED does away with the need for a zk-VM by compiling smart contract functions directly to zero knowledge circuits, making it the first zk-Native blockchain. QED’s novel approach to ZKP allows users to prove their own transactions on their own device in milliseconds, enabling a new privacy centric internet where transactions are private by default and sensitive data never has to leave a user’s device.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With its announcement of the QED Protocol, Open Asset Standards unveiled QED&#8217;s official Dapen Smart Contract IDE. With Dapen, Web2 developers can write zk Smart Contracts in the world&#8217;s 2 most popular programming languages, JavaScript and Python, which have a developer market share 357 times larger than the Solidity community which only makes up a miniscule 0.1% of the world’s developers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to making blockchain accessible to more developers than ever before, Dapen has integrated support for Markdown smart contracts which allow even non-technical users to write smart contracts in English using their integration with several large language AI models (LLMs) including ChatGPT.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Backed by Animoca Brands&#8217; fund Sparkle Ventures whose General Partners include Sebastien Borget, Co-founder of Sandbox, and Yat Siu, Co-founder of Animoca Brands, QED is set to see major adoption within the gaming space which regularly support millions of concurrent gamers playing at once. Due to its horizontal scaling model, QED is able to add transaction processing capacity by simply adding more proving nodes to its network, allowing large scale gaming to integrate with blockchain technologies such as dynamic NFTs for the first time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Headed up by Founder and CEO Carter Feldman, a former childhood hacking prodigy and reverse engineer, the QED core team is made up of a diverse team from both Web2 tech giants and Web3 titans including Binance, reflecting the protocol&#8217;s mission to unite Web2 and Web3.</span></p>
