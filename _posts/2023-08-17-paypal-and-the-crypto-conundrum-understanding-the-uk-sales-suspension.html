PayPal has announced a temporary suspension of cryptocurrency sales within the United Kingdom for a minimum of three months, commencing on October 1. This decision is in direct response to the recent regulatory reforms introduced by the Financial Conduct Authority, Britain&#8217;s financial regulator.Â  The FCA is set to implement more stringent guidelines aimed at curbing the advertising of cryptocurrencies to British consumers, which includes the mandatory inclusion of risk warnings and the discontinuation of &#8220;refer a friend&#8221; incentives.

This move comes against the backdrop of the impending enforcement of the &#8220;Travel Rule&#8221; in the UK. As of September 1, 2023, all cryptocurrency firms registered under the FCA will be obligated to adhere to the Travel Rule guidelines, a series of crucial Anti-Money Laundering and Know-Your-Customer regulations established by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). This mandate was introduced following governmental amendments to relevant legislation in July 2022. Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $28.525.
