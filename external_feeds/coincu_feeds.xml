<p>This agency has won a legal battle with decentralized organization Ooki DAO for allegedly providing unregistered items, disrupting the industry-wide perception that decentralized financial (DeFi) actors are immune to regulatory scrutiny.</p>



<p>US District Judge William H. Orrick ruled on Thursday that the Ooki DAO operated an illegal trading platform and illegally operated as an unregistered futures commission trader (FCM), which gives the default judgment to the CFTC. He ordered the organization to pay $643,542 in fines, permanently shut it down, and shut down its website. The regulator&#8217;s win proves that decentralized entities can face regulatory consequences for their transactions.</p>



<p>The original lawsuit, filed in US District Court for the Northern District of California last September, accused the DAO of providing &#8220;leveraged and margin&#8221; commodity trading to retail customers and not complying with consumer knowledge laws when serving those merchants.</p>



<p>Ooki DAO, the heir to a company called bZeroX, is accused of allowing Americans to trade illegal crypto derivatives products. In September, the CFTC settled the allegations with bZeroX and its founders, Tom Bean, and Kyle Kistner, and attempted to sue the entire DAO at once. Chatbots and forum messages served the lawsuit.</p>

<p>In January, this agency asked a federal judge to rule that the DAO violated federal commodity law after the DAO missed a deadline to respond to the lawsuit. However, a judge rejected this request.</p>



<p>There are more and more lawsuits against Defi organizations with the involvement of regulators. In March, a California court ruled that the bZx protocol and its token holders should be liable for mining losses that deplete their DAO coffers. And in April, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) subpoenaed SushiSwap Chef Jared Grey.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>The cryptocurrency exchange stopped providing services to institutional clients in the United States on June 21.</em></li>



<li><em>This outage comes from &#8220;limited demand&#8221; from institutional clients due to the &#8220;current market landscape&#8221;.</em></li>



<li><em>Retail investors will not be affected by this decision and will continue to be able to use the platform in the United States.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The company announced on Friday that Crypto.com will no longer offer its services to institutional customers in the United States, effective June 21. The Singapore-based crypto exchange has announced that it will no longer provide services to institutional customers in the United States from June 21.</strong></h5>

<p>The Crypto.com exchange said that institutional users have been informed in advance of the decision to suspend services given the &#8220;current market context,&#8221; which has &#8220;limited demand&#8221; from institutional customers. Retail investors will not be affected by this decision and will continue to be able to use the platform in the United States.</p>



<p>The decision came in the same week as crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase were sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), alleging that they violated securities laws.</p>



<p>On-chain data shows that since enforcement action by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) comes 12 hours after Binance.US announced it was suspending USD deposits and notifying customers that they were preparing to suspend fiat withdrawals, the exchange has seen a negative net outflow of $25.4 million in the past 24 hours and $1.4 million in the past hour.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrency companies are scaling back in the United States as regulators expand their desire to control the cryptocurrency market with draconian regulations. The massive exodus of crypto companies to leave the US and European markets to other Asian promised lands like Hong Kong has begun since the beginning of the year.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Polygon, the prominent Layer 2 project, is hinting at something that could capture the attention of a large community.</em></li>



<li><em>Other projects also joined the trend when posting tweets with just the number &#8220;2&#8221; and a purple background.</em></li>



<li><em>Many users believe in an upcoming project or possibly a new airdrop.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Recent Layer 2 projects have created an exaggerated mystery with the purple color of today&#8217;s top Layer 2 project Polygon covered around the number &#8220;2&#8221;.</strong></h5>

<p>Recently, a series of DeFi and Layer 2 projects are literally creating a new movement when simultaneously posting a mysterious tweet containing the number &#8220;2,&#8221; and the main background color is purple. Sandeep Nailwal, the Co-Founder of Polygon also <a href="https://twitter.com/sandeepnailwal/status/1666830608666963968" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> this mysterious tweet before.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>Not only Polygon but projects like Bungee, Polkastarter, and Orbiter Finance also responded to the movement, Umbrella Network even changed its Twitter profile picture.</p>

<p>Many users have begun to get excited about the event, claiming that it is an upcoming Polygon project that could cause a stir. Others think that an airdrop (very low probability) may be announced in the near future.</p>



<p>However, we should not expect something overwhelming like the Arbitrum airdrop or a potential new project, as this is not the first time the projects have posted such tweets together.</p>



<p>In February, the crypto community on Twitter woke up to the surprise of a series of top Ethereum DeFi projects that were “tumbling” about something.</p>



<p>Accordingly, the accounts of famous DeFi projects such as Maker, Yearn Finance, SushiSwap, Balancer, Euler, Opyn, Degenscore, Gearbox Protocol, Zerion, Phi.xyz, Dopex, Aura Finance, … simultaneously posted pictures &#8220;fists facing left and right” with the caption “Monday <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />” without providing further information.</p>



<p>Since then, a series of other projects have also quickly &#8220;caught trending&#8221; and shared images associated with their brand identity design, making the community even more curious. But in the end, it&#8217;s just another attempt at team collaboration on projects.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>DAI, the stablecoin issued on the Ethereum blockchain, has gained significant traction in decentralized exchanges, with approximately 42% of its initial use cases being in this sector.&nbsp;</em></li>



<li><em>This highlights the growing importance of DAI within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a recent announcement, MakerDAO revealed that approximately 42% of the initial use cases for DAI, the stablecoin issued on the Ethereum blockchain, are within decentralized exchanges (DEXs).&nbsp;</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/makerdao.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="647" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/makerdao.jpeg" alt="MakerDAO: About 42% of DAI&#039;s Initial Use Cases Are For Decentralized Exchanges" class="wp-image-193795" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/makerdao.jpeg 1000w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/makerdao-300x194.jpeg 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/makerdao-768x497.jpeg 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/makerdao-750x485.jpeg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" title="MakerDAO: About 42% of DAI&#039;s Initial Use Cases Are For Decentralized Exchanges 15"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>It was noticed by MakerDAO that around 42 percent of the early use cases for DAI, the stablecoin that is issued on the Ethereum blockchain, are within decentralized exchanges (DEXs).&nbsp;</p>



<p>This highlights the growing adoption and importance of DAI in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Other significant use cases include destruction, national debt, lending, and personal address holdings.</p>



<p>Notably, around 70% of the total DAI supply is held in Ethereum addresses, while 22.9% is distributed across bridges, DEXes, lending platforms, and the Dai Savings Rate (DSR). Only a minuscule 0.6% of DAI resides in centralized finance (CeFi) platforms such as exchanges and on-ramps.</p>

<p>Coincu reported that the core development team of <a href="https://news.coincu.com/190286-makerdao-increasing-dai-savings-rate/">MakerDAO</a> has proposed increasing the DAI savings rate to 3.33% in response to soaring interest rates and the need to counter persistent inflation driven by actions of the US Federal Reserve. This adjustment to the DSR aims to attract more users and stimulate DAI usage. Interest will be accrued in real-time based on the system&#8217;s revenue, and the proposal is currently undergoing the formal voting process.</p>



<p>The proposed increase in the DSR has garnered strong support from the community, with many believing it will further enhance DAI&#8217;s appeal. Some community members have even indicated that they would explore alternatives to DeFi borrowing if the proposal is approved.</p>



<p>As DAI continues to gain prominence in decentralized exchanges and MakerDAO explores measures to improve its savings rate, the stablecoin&#8217;s role within the DeFi ecosystem is set to strengthen. These developments are expected to contribute to increased DAI usage and further growth in the decentralized finance space.</p>

<li><em>DOJ charges Russian hackers for attacking Mt.Gox and operating illegal BTC-E exchange, marking a significant milestone in major crypto investigations.</em></li>

<p>Bilyuchenko and Verner are accused, according to court records, of conspiring to launder around 647,000 bitcoins that were stolen from Mt.Gox during their attack. Additionally, Bilyuchenko is accused of collaborating with Alexander Vinnik to operate BTC-E between the years of 2011 and 2017. This complaint was brought against him in 2017.</p>



<p>The DOJ&#8217;s charges mark a significant milestone in two major cryptocurrency investigations. The indictment alleges that Bilyuchenko and Verner were involved in the extensive theft of cryptocurrency from <a href="https://news.coincu.com/167796-creditors-of-mtgox-receive-bitcoin/">Mt.Gox</a>. Furthermore, Bilyuchenko is believed to have played a role in the establishment of BTC-E, an exchange notorious for laundering funds for cyber criminals worldwide.</p>

<p>The allegations bring attention to the ongoing efforts within the bitcoin industry to address cybercrime and unlawful activity. The goal of the authorities is to improve the ecosystem&#8217;s security and integrity by holding individuals accountable for their role in illegal activities like as hacking and money laundering. This new information should serve as a warning to users of cryptocurrencies that they should place a high priority on security measures and proceed with extreme caution while interacting with cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>



<p>The filing of criminal charges against Russian hackers by the Department of Justice (DOJ) in connection with an attack on Mt.Gox and the operation of BTC-E sends a strong message that unlawful activities involving cryptocurrencies will not be tolerated. This action highlights the significance of regulatory enforcement as a means to defend the reputation of the sector and shield users from any potential dangers that may arise.</p>

<p>OKX announced that it has repurchased and burned 5,497,312.77 OKB tokens, equivalent to approximately $258 million. The buyback and burn period spanned from March 1, 2023, to May 31, 2023. This strategic move is expected to increase the value of the remaining OKB tokens in circulation.</p>



<p>Following the announcement, the price of OKB experienced a modest increase, rising from $44 to $45, representing a 1.4% surge within the past 24 hours. The market capitalization of OKB now stands at an impressive $2.6 billion.</p>



<p>Since the inception of the OKB buyback and burn program in April 2019, the platform has eliminated a total of 64,042,314.70 OKB tokens. As a result, the current circulating supply of OKB has reduced to 235,957,685.30 OKB.</p>

<p>The buyback and burn initiative demonstrates <a href="https://news.coincu.com/189670-okx-listing-16-popular-tokens-hong-kong/">OKX</a>&#8216;s commitment to increasing the value and scarcity of OKB tokens. By reducing the supply, OKX aims to create a more attractive investment proposition for token holders and foster a positive market sentiment.</p>



<p>OKX&#8217;s latest buyback and burn event, resulting in the destruction of millions of OKB tokens worth $258 million, underscores the exchange&#8217;s commitment to enhancing the value of OKB tokens. As the circulating supply continues to decrease, the remaining OKB tokens are expected to become more scarce and potentially experience an increase in value. The success of the buyback and burn program reflects OKX&#8217;s proactive approach to token management and its focus on creating a robust and valuable ecosystem for its users.</p>

<p>According to a case <a href="https://webapps.sftc.org/ci/CaseInfo.dll?&amp;SessionID=506627B85CF53F14BE39606F8C85FCE599BFF1B8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed</a> in the Superior Court of California, San Francisco, Curve Finance founder Michael Egorov stole the three VC companies&#8217; trade secrets and cheated them out of over $1 million in money while dangling the false promise of prospective ownership in Curve to acquire the investors&#8217; confidence and support.</p>



<p>Egorov allegedly deceived them in several ways over a six-month period, according to ParaFi Digital Opportunities, Framework Ventures, and 1kx.</p>



<p>The case, filed in April, also claims that Egorov relocated to Switzerland to avoid the impending legal consequences. Since 2020, the three companies have been pursuing breach-of-contract litigation against him and his business Swiss Stake in Switzerland.</p>



<p>Beginning in 2020, Egorov allegedly deceived three venture investors by falsely promising them a share in Curve Finance.</p>

<p>According to their most recent lawsuit filed in San Francisco in April, he is believed to have leveraged their network and reputation to win the trust and legitimize Curve Finance.</p>



<p>As events evolved, Egorov allegedly stole the plaintiff&#8217;s trade secrets, which included critical information for Curve Finance, such as industry relationships, financiers, and financial know-how.</p>



<p>Curve Finance is a platform that allows users to exchange tokens for cheap costs by pooling related assets. Platform liquidity providers are compensated with the protocol&#8217;s native coin CRV and trading fees.</p>



<p>As stated, no VC funds were used to employ engineers, attorneys, or other personnel since Erogov has no intention of selling the business. It also claims that he sold millions of dollars worth of CRV tokens, which the complaint claims belonged to them.</p>

<p>According to court records filed on May 22, Egorov&#8217;s lawyers allege that the action filed in San Francisco is a response to three-year-old litigation in Switzerland. They contend that his firm, Swiss Stake (Curve&#8217;s license holder), has the legal authority to end the dispute.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“To justify their blatant forum shopping, Plaintiffs concocted a new and compelling story painting Egorov as an evil villain who duped three naïve VC firms into giving up ‘trade secrets,’&#8221; Egorov’s lawyers said in the filing.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The hearing on VC&#8217;s charges of missed commercial possibilities with Curve&#8217;s rivals is still pending. Michael Egorov will make a statement after consulting with his attorneys. The VCs&#8217; attorneys indicated they would respond later.</p>

<p>The United States Department of Justice recently unsealed charges against two Russian nationals for their alleged involvement in hacking and laundering approximately 647,000 bitcoins from the cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox. The indictment also alleges that the two individuals went on to operate another illicit cryptocurrency exchange called BTC-e. The charges highlight the Department of Justice&#8217;s commitment to bringing bad actors in the cryptocurrency ecosystem to justice and preventing financial system abuse.</p>



<p>According to court <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-nationals-charged-hacking-one-cryptocurrency-exchange-and-illicitly-operating-another" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-nationals-charged-hacking-one-cryptocurrency-exchange-and-illicitly-operating-another" rel="noreferrer noopener">documents</a>, the two individuals gained unauthorized access to the server holding the cryptocurrency wallets for Mt. Gox. They fraudulently caused bitcoin to be transferred to bitcoin addresses controlled by them and their co-conspirators. </p>



<p>They allegedly caused the theft of approximately 647,000 bitcoins from Mt. Gox between September 2011 and at least May 2014, representing the vast majority of the bitcoins belonging to Mt. Gox&#8217;s customers. They allegedly laundered the bulk of the bitcoins stolen through Mt. Gox principally through bitcoin addresses associated with accounts controlled at two other online bitcoin exchanges.</p>

<p>The indictment charges the two individuals with conspiracy to commit money laundering, and one of them is also charged with operating an unlicensed money services business. The Justice Department noted that the charges are an important milestone in two major cryptocurrency investigations.</p>



<p>The FBI, IRS-CI, and Homeland Security Investigations are among the agencies investigating the case, and the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Offices for the Southern District of New York and the Northern District of California are handling the cases. The Justice Department&#8217;s Office of International Affairs has also assisted.</p>
