					<description><![CDATA[Solana is showing bullish signs above $15 against the US Dollar. SOL price could extend its rally above the $18 and $20 resistance levels. Sol price started a fresh increase above the $15 and $16 levels against the US Dollar. The price is now trading above $16 and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours). There is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $15.90 on the 4-hours chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could rise further if it stays above the $15.00 and $12.80 support levels. Solana Price Eyes More Gains This week, solana price formed a base and started a steady increase above the $14 level. There was a strong increase above the $15 resistance zone, similar to bitcoin and ethereum. The bulls even managed to pump the price above the $16.50 resistance. It traded to a new yearly high at $17.47 and is currently consolidating gains. There was a minor correction below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $12.70 swing low to $17.47 high. Sol price is now trading above $16 and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours). There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $15.90 on the 4-hours chart of the SOL/USD pair.

If SOL fails to clear the $18 resistance, it could start a downside correction. An initial support on the downside is near the $16.35 level. The first major support is near the $15.00 level and the trend line. It is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $12.70 swing low to $17.47 high.

					<description><![CDATA[Ethereum has rallied above $1,400 today as on-chain data shows ETH sharks have been busy accumulating recently. Related Reading: Altcoin Volume Dominance At Highest Since Jan 2021, Trouble For Bitcoin? Ethereum Shark Addresses Have Grown By 3,000 In the Last Two Months As per data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the current number of shark addresses in the market is the highest since February 2021. The relevant indicator here is the &#8220;ETH Supply Distribution,&#8221; which tells us which coin groups have how many wallets. These coin groups are ranges that define the number of coins the addresses currently hold in a particular group. For example, the 1-10 coins cohort includes all wallets holding at least one and at most 10 ETH. The Supply Distribution metric for this group would then track the total number of addresses falling inside this range. In the context of the current topic, the coin group of interest is the 100-10,000 coins cohort (which is made up of two separate groups, 100-1,000 coins, and 1,000-10,000 coins; they have just been merged).

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum has rallied above $1,400 today as on-chain data shows ETH sharks have been busy accumulating recently.</p>

<h2><b>Ethereum Shark Addresses Have Grown By 3,000 In the Last Two Months</b></h2>
<p>As per data from the on-chain analytics firm<a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1613359474710048768" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> Santiment</a>, the current number of shark addresses in the market is the highest since February 2021. The relevant indicator here is the &#8220;ETH Supply Distribution,&#8221; which tells us which coin groups have how many wallets.</p>
<p>These coin groups are ranges that define the number of coins the addresses currently hold in a particular group. For example, the 1-10 coins cohort includes all wallets holding at least one and at most 10 ETH. The Supply Distribution metric for this group would then track the total number of addresses falling inside this range.</p>
<p>In the context of the current topic, the coin group of interest is the 100-10,000 coins cohort (which is made up of two separate groups, 100-1,000 coins, and 1,000-10,000 coins; they have just been merged). Now, here is a chart that shows the Supply Distribution data for this Ethereum coin group:</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Polkadot has finally managed to break past the rigid price resistance mark of $5. Over the last 24 hours, DOT increased by more than 6%. In the past week, the coin has secured double-digit gains. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Climbs 5% To Take Out Hurdles, Is Bottom Really In? Bitcoin moved into its daily chart&#8217;s $18,000 price zone, pushing altcoins on their respective charts. Although DOT rallied in the last 24 hours, the altcoin is still not out of the woods. The altcoin must remain above two price levels. The technical outlook still sided with the bulls, but there was a fall in the accumulation on the daily chart, indicating that there has been a fall in demand. The demand, however, secured by DOT reached a multi-month high. Usually, after being overvalued, the coin starts to retrace on its chart. Indicators showed that if buyers do not remain consistent, DOT will depreciate on its chart over the subsequent few trading sessions. The altcoin market capitalization fell slightly in the last 24 hours, which meant demand for the altcoin dipped. At the moment, DOT was trading 90% below its all-time high of 2021. Polkadot Price Analysis: One-Day Chart DOT was trading at $5.09 at the time of writing. The coin was trading within an ascending parallel channel (blue). The ascending parallel channel marked a bullish force in the market. At the time of writing, Polkadot broke above the ascending parallel channel, indicating that DOT might consolidate over the subsequent trading sessions before it starts to retrace. Immediate resistance for the coin stood at $5.30; if it managed to breach that level, it could rally to $5.40. On the other hand, if Polkadot loses its momentum, it will fall to $4.80. The altcoin has to remain above the $4.80 mark, or the bears will take over completely. Technical Analysis The altcoin was still in the bullish zone despite a slight fall in demand. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) was above the 60 mark with a minor downtick; this indicated that although demand fell, the price was under bullish control. Similarly, the asset price was seen above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA), which indicated that the bulls were driving the price momentum in the market. As RSI secured a multi-month high, the altcoin traveled above the 50-SMA (yellow) line. With increased demand, technical indicators pointed out traders could have a buying opportunity. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence suggests price momentum and reversals. Related Reading: Avalanche Impresses With 32% Rally – Will AVAX Sustain This Ascent?

					<description><![CDATA[According to a tweet by TRON (TRX) on January 10, the network has displayed an impressive performance as it is currently ranked second in terms of total value locked (TVL) in the entire crypto space. TRON&#8217;s TVL has reached $9.2 billion by end of 2022, TRON DAO disclosed. Related Reading: Avalanche Impresses With 32% Rally – Will AVAX Sustain This Ascent? TRON chief executive to extend help to FTX and SBF TRX price spikes by 1.52% TRX remains robust in terms of trades A lot of people are now keeping an eye on TRON, and wondering whether it can hold on to its ranking and recuperate especially following its recent sharp decline. The network has always championed its quest for further decentralization. In fact, in comparison to other crypto assets, TRX has made significant progress over a short span of time. Image: TRON DAO TRX Price In The Green, Up 11% In Last Week According to CoinMarketCap, TRX&#8217;s price has increased by 11% in the last seven days, and trading at $0.05744 as of writing. Noticeably, many investors are worried about their crypto investments, especially with the crypto crash that happened just recently. Image: CoinMarketCap TRON CEO, Justin Sun, disclosed that he would extend some help to both FTX and its former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried so the crypto exchange can recover. This recent statement by Sun is quite controversial and has put the network on a bad light. More so, this caused investors to hesitate with the crypto especially as it shows support for the disgraced crypto company. Meanwhile, TRX is said to lead the crypto space in terms of trustworthiness, being an open network. The year 2022 is said to be the token&#8217;s best year so far with its price shooting to as much as 2,950%, an all-time high. In fact, even in the face of an ongoing bear market, TRON remains to be as robust as ever in terms of trades with investors generously funding the network. FUD Surrounding TRON Still Felt Recent price activity in TRON (TRX) has been influenced by Bitcoin (BTC) and the activity of the US stock market. On the 11th of January, speculators wagered on reduced U.S. inflation, which boosted cryptocurrency markets and led to a rally on U.S. stock markets. At the time of publication, the fear, uncertainty and doubt surrounding TRON&#8217;s founder Sun and the Huobi exchange can still be felt, which contributed to the negative weighted sentiment regarding TRX. TRX total market cap at $5.2 billion on the daily chart &#124; Chart: TradingView.com Related Reading: Polkadot Records New Achievements In Dev’t Activity, Pushes DOT Price Up This demonstrates that the investor had a pessimistic view of the asset going into the transaction. However, this was not enough to stop TRX from surging. At this point, TRON’s revenue has shown to spike from $509,942 to $637,526 as seen in the previous month. The increase in revenue is said to be triggered by the padding of the number of active wallet addresses on the network which also shows an increase in users by 4.53%. Overall sentiment for TRON is positive, which could mean that TRX price has the potential to skyrocket in the future. -Feature image by MEXC Blog]]></description>

<h2><b>TRX Price In The Green, Up 11% In Last Week</b></h2>
<p>According to<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tron/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> CoinMarketCap</a>, TRX&#8217;s price has increased by 11% in the last seven days, and trading at $0.05744 as of writing.</p>
<p>Noticeably, many investors are worried about their crypto investments, especially with the crypto crash that happened just recently.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-515890 size-full" src="https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/a-35.png" alt="" width="859" height="379" srcset="https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/a-35.png 859w, https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/a-35-460x203.png 460w, https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/a-35-768x339.png 768w, https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/a-35-750x331.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 859px) 100vw, 859px" /></p>

<p>TRON CEO,<a href="https://www.theportugalnews.com/news/2023-01-11/apecoin-ape-and-tron-trx-pump-orbeon-protocol-orbn-is-quickly-selling-out-its-presale/73724" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> Justin Sun</a>, disclosed that he would extend some help to both FTX and its former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried so the crypto exchange can recover. </p>
<p>This recent statement by Sun is quite controversial and has put the network on a bad light. More so, this caused investors to hesitate with the crypto especially as it shows support for the disgraced crypto company.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, TRX is said to lead the crypto space in terms of trustworthiness, being an open network. The year 2022 is said to be the token&#8217;s best year so far with its price shooting to as much as 2,950%, an all-time high.</p>
<p>In fact, even in the face of an ongoing bear market, TRON remains to be as robust as ever in terms of trades with investors generously funding the network.</p>
<h2><b>FUD Surrounding TRON Still Felt</b></h2>
<p>Recent price activity in TRON (TRX) has been influenced by Bitcoin (BTC) and the activity of the US stock market. On the 11th of January, speculators wagered on reduced U.S. inflation, which boosted cryptocurrency markets and led to a rally on U.S. stock markets.</p>
<p>At the time of publication, the fear, uncertainty and doubt surrounding TRON&#8217;s founder Sun and the Huobi exchange can still be felt, which contributed to the negative weighted sentiment regarding TRX.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/FHYVKhic/" width="2047" height="979" /></p>


<p>This demonstrates that the investor had a pessimistic view of the asset going into the transaction. However, this was not enough to stop TRX from surging.</p>
<p>At this point, TRON’s revenue has shown to spike from $509,942 to $637,526 as seen in the previous month. The increase in revenue is said to be triggered by the padding of the number of active wallet addresses on the network which also shows an increase in users by 4.53%.</p>
<p>Overall sentiment for TRON is positive, which could mean that TRX price has the potential to skyrocket in the future.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The crypto rally that greeted the new year has definitely brought gains to the world of altcoins. According to CoinMarketCap data, most huge gains were made by altcoins in the past 30 days. AVAX, native token of the Avalanche blockchain, is one of them with gains of up to 32% in the seven days.  The rally came as major cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum all registered gains and increased investor sentiment. Although the fear, uncertainty, and doubt of the last year’s bear market is still present, the increasing chance of a recession still gives investors some worry. As of writing, AVAX is trading at $15.96, up 28% in the last 24 hours, data from Coingecko show. What Supported The Avalanche Rally?  The Avalanche ecosystem has been bullish. Recently, Shopify partnered with Avalanche to allow Shopify merchants to sell their NFTs. According to public information, users don’t need to handle any cryptocurrencies to buy NFTs.  Venly, one of the numerous blockchain partners of Shopify, created a no-code tool for sellers to create NFTs. In a recent interview, Venly co-founder Tom Dierckxens said that this evolution in NFT technology is an evolution which can be adopted in the mass market. This is only the most previous on-chain development for the ecosystem. On a previous tweet by Axaholic, a Twitter account dedicated to Avalanche updates, the ecosystem partnered up with Re Protocol which tokenizes the reinsurance industry, empowering business through blockchain solutions.  On-chain developments also led to Avalanche experiencing a strong uptick in development activity and price as seen on data provided by Santiment.  Also, the world&#8217;s largest cloud provider, Amazon Web Services (AWS), has joined forces with blockchain technology firm Ava Labs to speed up and broaden the use of blockchain across different types of industries.

Image: Phemex Will AVAX Maintain Its Momentum? The current momentum seems to be profit-taking behavior before another bullish leg up. With the markets anticipating lower Consumer Price Index levels, AVAX might have a needed boost in the coming release on Thursday.   However, with its high correlation with Bitcoin, it could follow the top crypto in any direction. Bitcoin, as of writing, has broken past the $18,000 mark and trading at $18,229, up 8.2% in the last seven days, based on data by Coingecko.

The Bollinger Bands in the middle of the chart are a measure of the volatility of the price swings over a given time period (daily or weekly) and are shown in gray. Volatility goes up when the space between the bands (or the amount of gray area) extends. -Featured Image: Cointribune]]></description>

On a previous <a href="https://twitter.com/avaxholic/status/1610124275327078401?s=20&amp;t=6BL_oNwC5cRjy9ywIYMijA" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">tweet</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/avaxholic" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Axaholic</a>, a Twitter account dedicated to Avalanche updates, the ecosystem partnered up with Re Protocol which tokenizes the reinsurance industry, empowering business through blockchain solutions. </p>
<p>On-chain developments also led to Avalanche experiencing a strong uptick in development activity and price as seen on data provided by <a href="https://app.santiment.net/s/xHE24U_N" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Santiment</a>. </p>
<p>Also, the world&#8217;s largest cloud provider, Amazon Web Services (AWS), has joined forces with blockchain technology firm Ava Labs to speed up and broaden the use of blockchain across different types of industries.</p>

<p>With this collaboration, Avalanche, Ava Labs&#8217; layer-1 blockchain, will be more accessible to individuals and businesses, and node administrators will have more control over the network&#8217;s performance and functionality.</p>

<h2><strong>Will AVAX Maintain Its Momentum?</strong></h2>
<p>The current momentum seems to be profit-taking behavior before another bullish leg up. With the markets anticipating lower Consumer Price Index levels, AVAX might have a needed boost in the coming release on Thursday.  </p>
<p>However, with its high correlation with Bitcoin, it could follow the top crypto in any direction. Bitcoin, as of writing, has broken past the $18,000 mark and trading at $18,229, up 8.2% in the last seven days, based on data by Coingecko.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the chart above contrasts the token&#8217;s price adjustment and volatility over the past 24 hours (left) with that during the last seven days (right).</p>
<p>The Bollinger Bands in the middle of the chart are a measure of the volatility of the price swings over a given time period (daily or weekly) and are shown in gray.</p>
<p>Volatility goes up when the space between the bands (or the amount of gray area) extends.</p>
