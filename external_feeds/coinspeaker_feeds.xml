										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-german-license-denied-bafin/">Binance Application for German Operational License Denied by BaFin</a></p>
<p>Germany&#8217;s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) has reportedly denied the Binance exchange&#8217;s application for a crypto custody license. Finance Forward, a news publication, has <a href="https://financefwd.com/de/binance-lizenz-deutschland/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> that BaFin has communicated this decision directly to the exchange.</p>
<p>The decision signifies a regulatory setback for the crypto trading platform. A custody license would have allowed <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> to legally offer crypto custody services to its German customers, ensuring compliance with the country&#8217;s stringent financial regulations.</p>
<p>People familiar with the matter suggest that BaFin&#8217;s decision was influenced by concerns over the lack of transparency and regulatory compliance within Binance&#8217;s operations. However, The nature of BaFin&#8217;s decision regarding Binance&#8217;s custody license remains uncertain.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear if the denial constitutes a formal cancellation or an expression of intent amid ongoing negotiations. However, the message conveyed by these discussions is undeniably clear, BaFin has doubts about Binance&#8217;s compliance with regulatory standards.</p>
<p>Notably, a Binance spokesperson has acknowledged the ongoing discussions with regulators and emphasized the company&#8217;s commitment to complying with BaFin&#8217;s requirements. On the other hand, BaFin declined to comment on the matter due to professional secrecy requirements in Germany.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Binance has already established a significant presence in the German crypto market. As one of the largest crypto apps in Germany, Binance has managed to attract a substantial user base, with an estimated two million customers.</p>
<p>Despite the absence of a license, individuals can still access the Binance website and app, as there are no explicit restrictions on visiting or using the platform. However, limitations arise in terms of the Binance exchange&#8217;s ability to legally provide custodial services and certain other regulated activities in Germany.</p>
<h2>BaFin Rejection: Implications for Binance</h2>
<p>The denial of a custody license in Germany poses significant challenges for Binance, as Germany represents one of Europe&#8217;s largest and most influential markets. With the license, Binance would have gained a competitive advantage by offering compliant custodial services to German customers.</p>
<p>However, without the necessary license, Binance is not permitted to promote its services within the country. This can potentially impede the company&#8217;s growth and outreach to potential customers in the German market.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this action may affect Binance&#8217;s credibility in the broader crypto market. Given the increased emphasis on regulatory compliance, exchanges that fail to meet regulatory criteria risk losing credibility and may find it difficult to retain the trust of both investors and institutional partners.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that Binance is not the only Fintech startup that has been scrutinized by German regulators. Other fintech startups targeted by German regulators include Crypto.com, Cakedefi, and Uniswap.</p>
<p>Recent reports also suggested that Binance has encountered challenges with regulatory approvals and operations in various jurisdictions. A recent report revealed that Binance <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-withdraws-application-austria/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">withdrew</a> its application for regulatory approval in Austria.</p>
<p>Additionally, the company has reportedly abandoned its registration with Cyprus&#8217; securities regulator and decided to <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-bids-farewell-to-the-netherlands-a-new-crypto-gem-with-the-growth-potential-of-btc-goes-global/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exit</a> the Netherlands after an unsuccessful attempt to register.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ecb-cbdc-trials-2024/">ECB Set to Launch CBDC Market Settlement Trials by 2024</a></p>
<p>The European Central Bank will begin trials on market transaction settlements using distributed ledger technology (DLT) via a central bank digital currency (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBDC</a>). The ECB’s readiness to begin the CBDC trials and experimentation follows the first <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/groups/ntwcg/pdf/ecb.ntwdocs230621_outcome_1st_ntwcg_meeting.en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meeting</a> of the New Technologies for Wholesale Settlement Contact Group (NTW-CG).</p>
<p>The minutes of the meeting explored transaction settlements between financial institutions in addition to the development of a CBDC. The ECB’s trials will begin in 2024 and likely cover basic transactions and settlements as they will be “limited in capacity and time”.</p>
<h2>The ECB and the Digital Euro CBDC</h2>
<p>Last month, the ECB <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ecb-digital-euro-prototype-cbdc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finalized</a> a digital euro prototype and published a report on its findings. Although this prototype is a result of deep research, the apex bank has yet to decide on CBDC issuance.</p>
<p>The ECB’s report indicated that it researched the use of DLT and smart contracts as a framework for the CBDC. While they proved essential, the ECB has concerns about decentralized smart contracts. Nonetheless, executive board member Fabio Panetta notes that the digital euro would integrate with the existing financial ecosystem. This would help financial institutions to expand innovation and related solutions. The report came after the ECB conducted the prototype exercise from July 2022 to February 2023.</p>
<p>The European Commission also published proposals that support the use of a digital euro that complements coins and banknotes. The Commission said it recognizes that while most people like the cash option, many others want digital options for payment, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<h2>More Research into a European CBDC</h2>
<p>Proposals submitted by the European Commission contain a legislative proposal to safeguard the role of cash and another to create a legal framework for the digital euro. The Commission’s proposal states that the euro would support direct transactions between devices, would not require an internet connection, and would ensure a higher level of privacy. However, the Commission notes that its proposal still depends on the ECB to determine CBDC issuance.</p>
<p>The European Parliament is in favor of continued research into a CBDC. However, its position on issuance may be less favorable. According to a <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/european-parliament-research-digital-euro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> by the Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, a CBDC could adversely affect the ECB. Economist Ignazio Angeloni, who authored the report, believes that a CBDC would force the ECB to compete with commercial banks for deposits.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Angeloni states that the CBDC should not be too successful or too unsuccessful. If too successful, there would be adverse consequences for the monetary policy if bank intermediation is not optimum. This could lead to financial instability if the process &#8211; which channels funds between institutions with surplus and those that do not have enough &#8211; is destabilized.</p>
<p>On the other hand, an unsuccessful CBDC would mean the ECB wasted a lot of resources. According to the economist, the ECB would also suffer reputational damage.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-future-growth-aspects/">Binance Continues to Focus on Future Growth Aspects despite Regulatory Hurdles</a></p>
<p>This month, crypto exchange <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> has gone through a lot of regulatory turbulence after facing major lawsuits from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a> action has also led to Binance losing some market share in June.</p>
<p>However, these regulatory hurdles haven&#8217;t deterred Binance from making further progress with future goals in mind. As per the latest press release shared with Coinspeaker, Binance is implementing machine learning and AI to make the platform safer and more secure.</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>In Binance&#8217;s peer-to-peer (P2P) platform, ML technology is employed to identify suspicious language in communications. By utilizing ML in P2P chat, feedback, and advertisements, potential payment scams, customer service impersonation, and malicious messaging can be detected. This technology has proven effective in preventing thousands of scams.</p>
<p>For the know-your-customer (KYC) process, Binance utilizes a combination of computer vision (CV) and AI. These technologies aid in verifying documents and videos submitted by users during the registration process. The implementation of CV and AI has significantly strengthened the verification process, enabling the detection of forged KYC documents and facial attacks.</p>
<p>In addition to enhancing security, Binance explores the creative use of AI. An example is Bicasso, a feature that leverages advanced AI technology to generate user avatars, which can then be transformed into non-fungible tokens (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFTs</a>). This demonstrates Binance&#8217;s commitment to leveraging AI for innovative product development.</p>
<h2>Binance Is Improving Infrastructure</h2>
<p>Over the last year, Binance&#8217;s engineering team has been working hard to improve the platform&#8217;s infrastructure thereby making it more faster and efficient for users. Binance has also upgraded its futures matching engine and thus increasing the capacity by 50%.</p>
<p>With some improvements to its Ledger, Binance claims that it has made transactions anywhere between 5-50 times faster.</p>
<p>Binance has implemented significant improvements to enhance user security, including the integration of passkey technology into Binance ID. This advanced technology provides users with increased protection against SMS scams and malicious attacks by making it more difficult for scammers to gain unauthorized access to accounts.</p>
<p>Continuing their focus on user-centric developments, Binance has introduced an updated <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-decentralized-finance-defi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeFi</a> wallet, offering users greater flexibility in choosing the crypto wallet that suits their needs. Leveraging Binance ID and passkey technology, the new DeFi wallet ensures that users never have to worry about losing their passkey or seed phrase.</p>
<p>Another example of Binance&#8217;s responsiveness to user needs is the introduction of the Binance Tax tool. This tool was developed after users expressed the need for a simplified and clearer method to access information for their tax returns.</p>
<p>Binance also understands the value of continuous improvements to the core trading experience. Throughout the year, they have introduced nearly 200 updates to enhance trading accessibility and provide users with essential information. These updates include features like the ability to reverse positions, access yearly profit and loss analysis, view multiple currencies simultaneously on charts, and additional shortcut buttons for easier navigation, such as Adjust Leverage, Stop PnL, Close Position, Market Close, and Reverse.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/hm-shares-soar-16-month-high/">H&#038;M Shares Soar 17%, Hits 16-Month High</a></p>
<p>On Thursday, popular fashion retailer H&amp;M saw its shares reach a 16-month high as its Q2 profits exceeded expectations. The multinational clothing company gained 16.74% to reach its highest level since February 2022. At a time when people are spending more on food to survive the increasing cost of living, the retailer managed to surge as it targets shoppers less vulnerable to the high standard of living. H&amp;M also began to record a significant share increase as it began its <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/hm-exits-russia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cost-cutting measures</a>.</p>
<p>Like many other companies, H&amp;M laid off employees to reduce high costs and amass profit. The company became the first European retailer to dismiss staff in response to the cost of living crisis. It cut 1,500 off its workers to save 2 billion Swedish crowns ($190 million) a year in November 2022.</p>
<p>&#8220;The external factors that affect our purchasing costs continue to improve, work on the cost and efficiency program is proceeding at full speed, and much of the work that we have done in recent years is starting to bear fruit,&#8221; H&amp;M CEO Helena Helmersson <a href="https://hmgroup.com/news/h-m-hennes-mauritz-ab-six-month-report-14/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>.</p>
<h2>H&amp;M Shares Pop as Sales Spike</h2>
<p>The company&#8217;s CEO Helena Helmersson said H&amp;M upped sales in multiple markets even as customers reduced their spending behavior. The number of people who splurge on clothing has diminished amid the unstable economy. Also, She mentioned that H&amp;M gathered profits in the second quarter, which caused its shares to soar despite the &#8220;unfavorable weather&#8221;. The CEO added that the sale of the company&#8217;s summer collection also began on a good level as summer kicks in across northern Europe.</p>
<p>Following impressive performance during the second quarter, H&amp;M continued at a good pace. Sales between June 1 and June 27 grew 10% YoY, with the most contribution from the womenswear collection. Cedric Rossi, the next-gen consumer analyst at Bryan Garnier in Paris, also had something to say about the factors pushing H&amp;M shares to a high level:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I was really surprised to see that, without any higher promotional activity &#8211; because markdowns were in line with last year &#8211; H&amp;M decreased its inventory position.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The sharp drop in inventory sales was another surprising cause, as the company&#8217;s inventory was at 16.7% of rolling 12-month sales on May 31, down from 19.2% a year earlier. Considering the better-than-expected profit and the inventory margin, investors could digest a weaker margin of 8.2% for the second quarter. Meanwhile, the company recorded 9.2% in the previous year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/worldcoin-okta-world-id/">Blockchain Project Worldcoin Taps Okta to Launch World ID</a></p>
<p>Blockchain identity project Worldcoin <a href="https://worldcoin.org/blog/announcements/sign-in-with-worldcoin-available-okta-auth0-marketplace" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">has announced</a> a new collaboration with Okta – an identity management software. According to the announcement, the collaboration will help Worldcoin to launch its proposed identity protocol, World ID, in Germany.</p>
<h2>Worldcoin Floats World ID, Brags About Its Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Per the announcement, World ID verification will start out in the German capital &#8211; Berlin. The new protocol will employ custom-designed hardware, called The Orbs, to verify German-based users using their biometric data.</p>
<p>By collaborating with Okta, Worldcoin has now introduced a &#8220;Sign in with Worldcoin&#8221; option on Okta&#8217;s Auth0 marketplace. That is the marketplace where developers access Okta&#8217;s authentication solutions. This means that developers may now use the new sign-in option as an alternative to <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/google/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a> or Facebook when they want to log in to their apps.</p>
<p>The press release also shared how users can become fully verified by World ID, Worldcoin&#8217;s identity protocol. Such users must first have their irises scanned at any of the Orbs, which have been placed at designated locations around the globe. The Orb will then use artificial intelligence (AI) to generate unique codes or cryptographic IDs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tiago Sada, head of product, engineering, and design at Tools for Humanity, the company behind Worldcoin, has heaped praises on the privacy policy of the Orb.</p>
<p>According to Sada, the Orb does not store by default, the data it captures while it processes a user&#8217;s biometric data into an ID that the user can store on their device. However, users also have the option to have their data stored. About that, Sada said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If they do that, then their data is encrypted, and then it can be used for things like improving the accuracy and inclusivity of the models.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Sada further revealed that a user can revoke the permission at any time.</p>
<p>As of publication, Worldcoin boasts a user base of 1.9 million users in 30 countries. Similarly, Okta <a href="https://www.okta.com/sg/resources/whitepaper/scaling-okta-to-billions-of-users/thankyou/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">claims</a> to service &#8220;hundreds of millions of users&#8221; presently.</p>
<p>So, by integrating with Okta and launching the World ID, Worldcoin hopes to help developers and applications distinguish between real humans and bots. But more importantly, the biometric data aspect can also help mitigate fraud attempts.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/tech-nothing-funding-96m-phone-2/">Tech Startup Nothing Secures $96M Funding for US Expansion Ahead of Phone (2) Launch</a></p>
<p>London-based tech startup Nothing has successfully closed its recent fundraising round with $96 million secured from both new and existing partners. The company was founded in 2020 by Carl Pei, the former co-founder of the smartphone maker OnePlus.</p>
<p>In an announcement on Twitter, Nothing revealed that the investment round was led by the European venture capital company Highland Europe with participation from GV, EQT Ventures, and C Capital, along with strategic stakeholder Swedish House Mafia. Due to the investment, Tony Zappala, a partner at Highland Europe, will join the company&#8217;s board.</p>

<p>— Nothing (@nothing) <a href="https://twitter.com/nothing/status/1674033720578256901?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 28, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Nothing Plans to Explore the US Tech Market for Its Phone (2) Launch</h2>
<p>The funds will be used to develop and introduce new products, as well as to boost sales and facilitate the company&#8217;s expansion into the United States market. Additionally, the new capital will be utilized to support the launch of its upcoming smartphone, the Phone (2). The highly anticipated Phone (2) is scheduled for release on July 11 and will feature a Qualcomm processor. With its sights set on the US market, Nothing aims to compete directly with tech giant Apple.</p>
<p>The London-based startup, which has factories in India and China, has already made a mark in the tech industry with its product lineup, which includes wireless earbuds such as Ear 1, Ear 2, and Ear Stick, as well as the Nothing Phone, its inaugural smartphone.</p>
<p>Armed with the recent funding injection, Nothing aims to strengthen its talent base and continue delivering innovative and fun consumer tech products. The company currently employs 450 individuals and is expanding its software engineering team alongside its hardware specialists. The team&#8217;s dedication and execution will play a crucial role in solidifying the company&#8217;s position as a prominent challenger in the consumer tech industry.</p>
<h2>Nothing Records 1.5 Million Product Sales to Date</h2>
<p>Despite the challenging landscape of the smartphone consumer market and the economic climate, Nothing has achieved significant milestones and is poised for further growth. The company reported $200 million in revenues in 2022 and is on track to exceed that figure this year. The firm said it had sold 1.5 million devices, with 800,000 phones sold to date.</p>
<p>&#8220;In just over two years, we&#8217;ve assembled one of the strongest teams in the industry and sold over 1.5 million devices worldwide. It&#8217;s clear that there&#8217;s a real demand for an innovative challenger in the consumer tech industry. With this new round of financing, we&#8217;ve never been better positioned to realize our vision to make tech fun again,&#8221; the company&#8217;s CEO, Carl Pei, said in a statement.</p>
<p>The successful fundraising round demonstrates investor confidence in the company&#8217;s product offerings, business model, and potential. The upcoming Phone (2) launch, which will also be made available to American consumers, marks a pivotal moment for the company&#8217;s expansion plans. While the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/nothing-nft-project-phone-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phone (1)</a> had a limited release due to radio band support, the upcoming Phone (2) has been designed to address this issue and target the lucrative US market.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the company&#8217;s future product roadmap remains exciting. With a vibrant community of nearly 46,000 members on Discord, the firm actively engages with its user base to gather insights and ideas for future products.</p>
<p>While a smartwatch production has been hinted at, Nothing&#8217;s focus extends beyond hardware. The company&#8217;s CEO has also expressed interest in improving software experiences and exploring areas where privacy-focused apps and services can thrive.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-loses-paysafe-eur/">Binance Loses Paysafe as EUR Banking Partner amid Regulatory Concerns</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a>, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/binances-european-banking-partner-stop-support-sept-coindesk-2023-06-29/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">has lost</a> its banking partner Paysafe in Europe. Binance partnered with Paysafe in January 2022 after losing Barclays and Santander as banking partners in 2021. Since then, the exchange has been trying to expand its presence and reach in Europe. Consequently, Paysafe&#8217;s decision will set back the exchange&#8217;s European plans.</p>
<h2>Paysafe Is Wary of Regulators</h2>
<p>Paysafe and Binance partnered Paysafe owns Skrill and Neteller, two popular e-wallet services that let users deposit and withdraw euros to and from Binance. However, its SEPA services will be unavailable to Binance users in the European Economic Area (EEA) from September 25.</p>
<p>While Paysafe did not give more reasons for its decision,  the move comes amid growing regulatory pressure on Binance in many countries, including the UK, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Canada. The exchange also recently ceased its operations in <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-bids-farewell-to-the-netherlands-a-new-crypto-gem-with-the-growth-potential-of-btc-goes-global/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Netherlands</a> and Cyprus and has been asked to stop its services in Belgium.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the US SEC has also accused Binance of operating without proper licenses, offering unregistered securities and breaking anti-money laundering rules. While Binance has expressed its disappointment at the SEC, it reiterated that it was committed to working collaboratively with regulators and partners around the world.</p>
<h2>Binance’s Woes: Potential Danger to the Crypto Ecosystem</h2>
<p>In the meantime, Binance informed its users that it is working to find another payment service provider.  It also reiterated that the decision would not affect its other services.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Binance has tried to improve its compliance and governance standards in recent months. The exchange has hired former regulators and bankers as advisers and executives. It also announced plans to set up regional headquarters and obtain licenses in different jurisdictions.</p>
<p>However, some analysts have noted that Binance’s decentralized and global structure makes it hard to regulate and oversee. Others like Tomio Geron, senior reporter at <a href="https://www.protocol.com/fintech/binance-regulation-crypto" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Protocol</a>, believe that Binance’s aggressive expansion into various regions attracted the scrutiny of regulators looking to protect investors.</p>
<p>One thing that everyone agrees on is that Binance’s troubles could hurt the wider crypto industry, as it has a large share of the market volume and liquidity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/orange-bank-operations-bnp-paribas/">Orange to Transfer Bank Operations to BNP Paribas as Both Giants Begin Exclusive Acquisition Talks</a></p>
<p>French telecommunications giant Orange is looking to get out of the banking sector by selling Orange Bank to <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/bnp-paribas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BNP Paribas</a>. Orange has now begun exclusive negotiations with BNP Paribas, which would end Orange’s banking business if successful.</p>
<p>Orange Bank has faced a little too much difficulty since the telecoms giant ventured into retail banking. The Orange Group began banking after buying a majority stake in Groupama Banque in 2016. At the time, Stephane Richard oversaw the acquisition and new business as the CEO. However, the current CEO, Christel Heydemann, is now getting rid of Orange Bank, hoping to sell it to BNP Paribas.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://newsroom.orange.com/the-orange-group-announces-the-completion-of-its-strategic-review-of-orange-bank-and-the-opening-of-exclusive-negotiations-with-bnp-paribas/?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">official release</a>, Orange Group says it began searching for a partner for Orange Bank after a strategic review months ago. The discussions will cover a partnership related to Orange Bank’s French customer portfolio and the bank’s Spanish business.</p>
<p>BNP Paribas chief operating officer Thierry Laborde expressed enthusiasm at the possibility of helping Orange Bank with its transition out of banking. According to Laborde, “as a long-standing partner of the Orange Group and Orange Bank, we are naturally delighted to be able to provide a complete continuity solution to Orange Bank customers following Orange Group’s strategic choice to withdraw from retail banking&#8230;we will support customers with a solid banking package and high-performance services.”</p>
<p>Orange Bank has sustained heavy losses since its inception, more than 1 billion euros ($1.09 billion), according to a Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/telecoms-company-orange-enters-exclusive-talks-with-bnp-paribas-exit-retail-2023-06-28/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a>. Another report states that Orange Bank <a href="https://www.aroged.com/2023/06/29/the-end-of-orange-bank-3-1-million-customers-could-leave-for-bnp-paribas/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">lost</a> about 200 million euros last year.</p>
<p>According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), Orange Bank could be done with banking entirely by 2026. If negotiations go well, Orange Bank will merge with Hello Bank, the online banking arm of BNP Paribas. Hello Bank has 800,000 customers in France and a total of 3.3 million in Europe. Successfully combining Hello with Orange’s over 2 million customers could put the merged company in fierce competition with other banking giants in the country. Orange Bank also has 700 employees at the moment.</p>
<p>Whether or not the talks will yield fruits remains to be seen. Nonetheless, Orange Bank intends to maintain normal banking operations throughout its negotiations with BNP Paribas. Hydelmann said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Our priority will be to provide exemplary support for all our employees and customers. This process will be carried out in complete transparency, within the framework of our dialogue with our staff representative bodies.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Orange Group notes in the press release that the operation only concerns Orange Bank’s business in France and Spain. It also states that the outcome does not affect Orange Group’s financial outlook for the 2023-2025 period. Also, the Group promises to conduct all processes in full transparency, and consult with employee representative bodies. Furthermore, Orange Group assures the full involvement of relevant authorities and regulators throughout the process.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/north-carolina-house-bill-bitcoin/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/north-carolina-house-bill-bitcoin/">North Carolina House Passes Bill to Study How Holding Bitcoin Could Be Profitable for State</a></p>
<p>The lower house of the North Carolina General Assembly has <a href="https://www.ncleg.gov/BillLookUp/2023/H721" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed</a> a bill that would task the Department of State Treasurer to assess the feasibility of the state holding Bitcoin (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC</a>). The study will also measure the benefits that the state could derive from such investments. The bill proposes allocating $50,000 to study the acquisition, secure storage, insurance, and liquidation of gold bullion and other virtual assets like BTC.</p>
<p>The study aims to determine the impact of holding gold and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin on North Carolina&#8217;s funds. It will also investigate whether these assets can help the state hedge against inflation or protect against systemic credit risks. Additionally, the study will examine whether these assets can reduce volatility and increase profits for the state.</p>
<p>The bill also explores the possibility of establishing a state-administered depository for cryptocurrencies, potentially making North Carolina a custodian for digital asset holdings in the United States. Before proceeding with this, the costs and benefits of using a privately managed depository or another state&#8217;s depository will be evaluated.</p>
<p>The state House of Representatives voted on the bill, with 73 out of 120 members voting in its favor, 40 members against it, and the remaining seven were absent. The bill will now need to be passed to the Senate, which can either approve it and sign it into law or reject it.</p>
<h2>The Bill Could Change How Digital Assets Including Bitcoin Are Perceived by North Carolina Government</h2>
<p>In another related matter, on May 4, the North Carolina House passed another bill with unanimous support. This bill prohibits the state from accepting payments made with a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and also prevents the United States <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/federal-reserve-system-frs-what-it-is-and-how-it-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Reserve</a> from using the state as a testing ground for future CBDC initiatives.</p>
<p>Initially, the bill was designed to stop all crypto payments within the state, but it was later amended to specifically prohibit <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBDC</a> payments. This means that state-affiliated institutions will not be accepting CBDC payments. While the legislation is in the best interest of the state, there are concerns that it could hinder innovation in digital assets and impede the growth of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in the state. Furthermore, the state recently imposed a one-year ban on crypto mining.</p>
<p>While North Carolina is taking steps to protect its citizens and mitigate the impact of cryptocurrencies, it is important to consider the potential benefits of digital assets to avoid falling behind in innovation.</p>
<p>Taken together, the CBDC and mining ban demonstrates North Carolina&#8217;s efforts to safeguard its people and regulate the influence of crypto. However, conducting a study on the potential benefits of digital assets has the potential to bring about significant changes in how cryptocurrencies and other digital assets are perceived in the state.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ftx-former-compliance-officer-fraud/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ftx-former-compliance-officer-fraud/">FTX Sues Former Compliance Officer for Enabling Top Management Fraud at Exchange</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ftx-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a> has filed a complaint in court that claims that Daniel Friedberg, one of its former top attorneys, was a major part of the fraud that company founder Sam Bankman-Fried and other top executives perpetrated. The <a href="https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/FTX/ExternalCall-DownloadPDF?id1=MTU0MDA0Mw==&amp;id2=0&amp;cid=0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">complaint</a>, which was filed in the US Bankruptcy Court in Delaware on Tuesday, claims that Friedberg acted as the company&#8217;s fixer on several occasions. That is, he was responsible for silencing, albeit with hush money payments, anyone that dared raise concerns about the company&#8217;s impropriety.</p>
<p>While Friedberg served as FTX US’s chief compliance officer, he was also a general counsel to Alameda Research, the trading arm of the exchange. His job roles ensured that Friedberg effectively helped FTX’s former management’s fraudulent scheme, per the complaint.</p>
<p>Rather than escalate concerns, Friedberg was said to deliberately ignore the alleged lack of internal controls at the exchange. And would even go as far as &#8216;whitewashing&#8217; employee complaints by settling claims for “inflated” amounts. The money was being thrown around so much that even in some cases, Friedberg would hire law firms that represented whistleblowers to act on behalf of FTX, says the company.</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, Friedberg ultimately created an enabling environment for FTX executives to mismanage customer funds. And he didn&#8217;t do all that for nothing. The lawsuit also claims that Friedberg received millions of dollars in unjustified compensation.</p>
<p>He currently faces 11 charges from FTX&#8217;s new legal team. And the charges include breach of fiduciary duty, legal malpractice, corporate waste, and several others related to fraudulent transfers. However, the full extent of Friedberg&#8217;s involvement and the damages thereof will only be determined at trial.</p>
<h2>FTX Seeks to Claw Back Tens of Millions of Dollars</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, FTX is also seeking to reclaim the funds Friedberg received while working for FTX. Those include payments linked to his $300,000 salary at FTX US, a $1.4 million signing bonus, an equity stake in the US arm of the exchange, and another $3 million payment from Alameda. Together, all of the funds are estimated to be worth “tens of millions” of dollars.</p>
<p>FTX <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ftx-exchange-files-for-bankruptcy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed</a> for bankruptcy in November 2022 after mismanaging customer deposits. And the company’s new leadership has repeatedly claimed that the firm&#8217;s failure was caused by <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/sam-bankman-fried/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bankman-Fried</a> and other top executives.</p>
<p>Bankman-Fried has been criminally charged for using billions in FTX customer funds to fund his personal ambitions.
