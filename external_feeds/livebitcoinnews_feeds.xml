										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CME Group in Chicago, one of the world’s biggest derivatives marketplaces, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cme-group-expand-bitcoin-ether-130000579.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">says it’s going to be</a> expanding its Ethereum and bitcoin-based options across both standard and micro-sized contracts.</p>
<h2>CME Group to Establish All-Day Bitcoin Contract Trading</h2>
<p>The news comes right as several other Ethereum and bitcoin-focused contracts are reaching their expirations now in late May. Through these new contracts, expiries are set to be available every day from Monday through Friday of each week. In a statement, Giovanni Vicioso – the CME Group global head of cryptocurrency products – said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are pleased to offer these new options contracts to provide market participants with greater precision and versatility in managing short-term bitcoin and ether price risk. Against a backdrop of heightened market volatility in the digital asset sector, we continue to see clients turn to a trusted, regulated venue like CME Group for reliable and efficient cryptocurrency risk management products.</p></blockquote>
<p>Previously, the CME Group only offered contracts that expired on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. However, these additions will ensure that contracts ending on Tuesdays and Thursdays will also be available to traders, meaning all present contracts will complement each other in the general scope of how the platform works.</p>
<p>Paul Eisma – head of options trading at XBTO – also threw his two cents into the mix, commenting:</p>
<blockquote><p>CME Group continues to innovate and lead in the institutional crypto options on [the] futures market. By completing the short end of the implied volatility surface with the addition of the new Tuesday [and] Thursday micro-options contracts and weekly standard-size contracts, institutional market makers such as XBTO can deliver precise liquidity to market participants of all sizes who trade and hedge cryptocurrency exposures spanning every business day of the upcoming week for the first time.</p></blockquote>
<p>There’s plenty of good news for the CME Group arising as of late. Some of the biggest news circles around the fact that the company has achieved a record daily average national rate of more than $3 billion, suggesting that more and more individuals are seeing bitcoin and Ethereum as valid tools and additions to their portfolios.</p>
<p>In addition, Q1 of 2023 saw more than 11,000 contracts, while open interest averaged more than 24,000 contracts. March 22 also saw a record high in bitcoin contracts traded on the platform (a total of more than 2,300), while open interest reached a high of 14,700 contracts at the end of March.</p>
<h2>Boosting the Crypto Space Like Never Before</h2>
<p>The last major news to emerge regarding CME Group <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/cme-group-is-releasing-new-around-the-clock-pricing-info-for-crypto-assets/" data-wpel-link="internal">came about well over</a> a year ago when it was announced the firm was going to be partnering with CF Benchmarks as a means of unveiling approximately 11 new crypto reference rates.</p>
<p>The rates were set to apply not to futures products, but to crypto networks like Litecoin, Cosmos, Polygon, Stellar Lumens, and Solana.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jon Blaylock has a rather <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-ph/news/others/ex-pastor-launches-cryptocurrency-to-raise-funds-for-philippine-churches/ar-AA19Xmnn" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">interesting history behind</a> him. In the past, he was a pastor at a church, though he’s since left the world of religion to focus on technical innovation, eventually beginning a company called 3lock that he’s now the CEO of.</p>
<h2>Jon Blaylock: A Former Religious Leader with a Vision</h2>
<p>His most recent venture involves establishing Ophir, a decentralized digital currency that will develop the first endowment smart contract on the blockchain (it&#8217;s named after a land mentioned in the Bible). The goal is to raise digital currency funds to help establish further churches throughout the Philippines – his native country – and help present institutions stay afloat.</p>
<p>The donation drive is known as “Project Ophir Crypto.” The goal is to attract crypto donations from all over the world to ensure churches in the country have what they need to keep their services going and their doors open to a God-seeking public. At the time of writing, several digital currencies are accepted through the program including USDT (a popular stable currency), USDC, ETH, SLP, and HEX.</p>
<p>Those who make donations are also set to receive Ophir tokens as rewards for their actions. While at the present time, these tokens possess no monetary value, this is likely to change in the future as Blaylock wants to make Ophir available for general trading on exchanges and similar platforms. In a recent statement, Blaylock mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>Opportunities for positive transformation are limitless… By creating a platform that is easy to use and available to all, we hope to empower people to take control of their finances and unlock their true potential, and by accepting a variety of cryptocurrencies, including ETH, USDC, USDT, SLP HEX, and TXN, we can reach a wider audience and make it easier for you to support our project.</p></blockquote>
<p>Continuing his discussion, he commented that if churches can move past technical blockades and adopt blockchain, the impacts will be “remarkable,” and he believes the current state of the church will be transformed for the better.</p>
<h2>Blockchain and Churches Already Have a History</h2>
<p>To an extent, the arenas of both religion and blockchain have <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/several-churches-are-saying-yes-to-btc-donations/" data-wpel-link="internal">already crossed paths</a> multiple times. This largely stems from the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/coronavirus/" data-wpel-link="internal">COVID pandemic</a> of three years ago. During that time, when religious services and institutions were cut off to the public due to stay-at-home orders, many had no means of donating to collection baskets so that their favorite steeples could remain upright.</p>
<p>This, in turn, caused many religious institutions to turn to blockchain and digital currencies. They began posting crypto addresses on their websites to ensure people could send money as necessary. In addition, the maneuver helped a lot of people avoid contact and touching funds that had clearly been handled by multiple hands and people over the years, thus limiting the spread of the disease.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vetle Lunde – a senior analyst at K33 Research – stated in a <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/bitcoin-could-peak-at-45k-in-may-analyst-says/ar-AA19Xegv" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">recent interview that</a> bitcoin, the world’s number one digital currency by market cap, is following the same patterns it did in 2019, and that the asset could wind up hitting $45K per unit either by the end of this month or next month.</p>
<h2>The Same Things We Witnessed Roughly Four Years Ago Are Showing Up Again</h2>
<p>It makes sense when he says that bitcoin is following the footsteps it left four years ago. 2019 was an interesting year in many ways given that it followed 2018 (naturally), which up to that point, was one of the worst years on record – if not <em>the</em> worst – for bitcoin. However, nobody could have thought anything could “outclass” it in terms of negativity the way 2022 has.</p>
<p>Last year was easily bitcoin’s worst period, with the asset losing well over 70 percent of its value and dropping into the mid-$16K range during the final weeks (a massive dip from the all-time high of $68,000 per unit it hit in November the previous year). The asset’s crash led the space to lose more than $2 trillion in overall valuation, especially as many other leading digital assets – such as Ethereum – chose to follow BTC’s path.</p>
<p>However, since the beginning of the year, the leading digital currency has experienced a few solid bumps that ultimately saw it jump into <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-rose-to-30k-in-mid-april-analysts-discuss-why/" data-wpel-link="internal">the $30K range as</a> recently as a few weeks ago. This marked the first time the coin hit such a mark in about ten or 11 months, and now, according to Lunde, the bull run is going to surge even further given that he thinks $45K is in the asset’s immediate future.</p>
<p>He stated in the discussion:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bottoms in both cycles lasted for approximately 370 days, and the peak-to-trough return after 510 days of both cycles reached 60 percent. In 2018, the bear market rally topped 556 days after the 2017 peak, on June 29, 2019, with a 34 percent drawdown from the peak. While history is far from likely to repeat in a similar fashion if the fractal were to continue, BTC would peak around May 20 at $45,000.</p></blockquote>
<p>During 2018, bitcoin lost more than 80 percent of its value. Prior to the start of that year, it hit its then all-time high of nearly $20K per unit, though by the end of the following year, it was trading in the low and mid-$3,000 ranges, and it took roughly five months for the asset to show any further signs of life.</p>
<h2>How Could a Rally, Which Means Prices Are Going Up, Ever Be &#8220;Hated?&#8221;</h2>
<p>Lunde further noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>The hated rally of 2019 ended with a significant blow-off top before BTC resumed trading at a 40-60 percent drawdown from its 2017 ATH. The early 2023 rally has all the hallmarks of a hated rally.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At a recent hearing in Delaware, it was <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/world/bankrupt-cryptocurrency-exchange-ftx-has-recovered-7-3-billion-in-cash-liquid-crypto-assets/ar-AA19MwSv" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announced the now</a> defunct crypto exchange FTX – which fell apart in November of last year – has recovered more than $7.3 billion in assets at the time of writing. This is an increase of more than $800 million since the month of January.</p>
<h2>FTX Is Trying to Pick Itself Up</h2>
<p>The company is working to garner as many funds as it can to pay off some of its loans as part of its bankruptcy proceedings, which it first entered roughly six months ago. The company is fully down in the dumps and is considering reopening in the future at some point according to FTX attorney Andy Dietderich. In a recent interview, he stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>The situation has stabilized, and the dumpster fire is out.</p></blockquote>
<p>First coming to fruition in the year 2019, FTX required only three years to come out as one of the world’s top five digital currency trading platforms. The company was overseeing billions in trades, and Sam Bankman-Fried – the main executive behind it – was lauded as a genius by many (his net worth was also in the billions towards the end of 2022).</p>
<p>Sadly, this reputation was short-lived as in mid-November, SBF complained of a liquidity crunch on social media. He said he <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-i-the-fall-of-a-token/" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>needed fast cash</strong></a> to keep his business in operation, and he eventually turned to his biggest rival Binance about a possible buyout. While things <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-ii-binance-said-it-would-buy-the-firm/" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>appeared to be moving</strong></a> in that direction for some time, Binance eventually backed <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-iii-the-rise-and-fall-of-sam-bankman-fried/" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>away from the deal</strong></a>, claiming the problems FTX was facing were simply too big for it to handle.</p>
<p>From there, the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/what-will-happen-now-that-ftx-is-bankrupt/" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>company filed bankruptcy</strong></a> and SBF resigned from his post. Things would have been bad enough if they had stopped there, but the trash meter kept rising. It was later discovered that SBF had utilized customer funds to invest in luxury Bahamian real estate and to pay off loans taken out by his other company Alameda Research. He <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-ftxs-disgraced-founder-has-been-arrested/" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>was eventually arrested</strong></a> and extradited back to the United States. He has <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/former-ftx-exec-sam-bankman-fried-pleads-not-guilty-to-fraud/" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>entered a not guilty plea</strong></a> and is awaiting trial at his <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-to-await-trial-at-his-parents-house/" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>parents’ California home</strong></a>.</p>
<h2>Rising Prices Have Helped</h2>
<p>One of the big things that has helped FTX in the long run is how much crypto prices have come along in just the past few weeks. For example, BTC rose to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-rose-to-30k-in-mid-april-analysts-discuss-why/" data-wpel-link="internal">a whopping $30K some</a> time ago, a big improvement from where it was at the end of last year (during that time, it was trading in the mid-$16K range).</p>
<p>Should the company decide to open its doors once again for business, the choice will be left up to the new CEO John Ray III, though Dietderich mentioned that it’s going to be a while before the enterprise can come back in such a way.</p>

<h2>Howard Marks Feels Bitcoin Has a Solid Future</h2>
<p>Over the past several weeks, Marks said bitcoin is becoming a huge power play for those losing faith in the American banking system, which has <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/analysts-provide-their-thoughts-on-latest-bitcoin-rally/" data-wpel-link="internal">been in trouble as</a> of late. At press time, about three banks in the U.S. have completely fallen apart, largely due to the ballooning debt the Fed has taken on.</p>
<p>In a recent interview, Marks commented on bitcoin:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are people who believe that when you have a bank crisis, like we did with Silicon Valley Bank and some of the others, that the weakness of the banks shows the strength of bitcoin. It&#8217;s in many ways an anti-bank play. It does seem that there are good uses for some coins, and bitcoin seems to be the one in the lead so far.</p></blockquote>
<p>He said that up to this point, interest rates have been relatively low, and they’re largely responsible for all the money U.S. investors have made over the past four and a half decades. He also said that while the present rate hikes aren’t likely to last much longer, he does think the days of super-low rates are dead and gone. He commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>The declining interest rates were responsible for the majority of all the money that&#8217;s been made in the last 45 years… The rates are high today to fight inflation. I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re going to stay this high, but they&#8217;re through coming down in any major way, and they&#8217;re through being ultra-low.</p></blockquote>
<p>He also stated that the present situation presents opportunities for both investors and the Fed to show some humility, which has been missing from the financial landscape in the U.S. for years. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Humility is a really important thing, especially in the market, which humbles us all. Anybody who doesn&#8217;t allow for humility, in a field where there&#8217;s randomness and uncertainty, and qualitative and subjective things are important, is riding for a fall.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the long run, he doesn’t think the Fed has done a good job in ensuring the cogs of the monetary machine keep running smoothly. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>People used to talk about the factory of the future, which would have one man and one dog, and it was the dog&#8217;s job to keep the man from touching the equipment. It was the man&#8217;s job to feed the dog. I would like to have the Fed keep its hands off the machinery most of the time.</p></blockquote>
<h2>AI Will Present Problems</h2>
<p>In closing, he said advancements in AI could cause problems for a lot of workers in the future, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>AI, just like passive investing and machine learning, even maybe to a greater extent, will knock out everybody who doesn&#8217;t add value.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is bitcoin mining <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/voracious-bitcoin-mining-messing-texans-090846053.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">running the state</a> of Texas into the ground?</p>
<h2>Texas Could Wind Up on the Wrong Side</h2>
<p>Texas declared itself open for bitcoin mining about two years ago. During that time, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-crypto-mining-clampdown-in-china-is-not-over/" data-wpel-link="internal">the nation of China</a> said the practice would be declared illegal, meaning those taking part in crypto mining within its borders had to find a new place to set up shop, and <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/texas-is-still-a-major-crypto-mining-hub/" data-wpel-link="internal">the Lone Star State seemed</a> like a good area given it had vast open land and cheap electricity.</p>
<p>However, according to a new report by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), things are beginning to move in a negative direction. The document states:</p>
<blockquote><p>Prospective crypto mining businesses have requested to put approximately 33,000 more megawatts in the ERCOT interconnection queue over the next few years (enough to power the whole state of Florida)… A single bitcoin transaction used nearly 1,452 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity, equal to the power consumption of an average U.S. household for nearly 50 days.</p></blockquote>
<p>A separate news outlet says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Their massive energy consumption combined with their ability to shut off almost instantly allows some companies to save money and make money by deftly pulling the levers of U.S. power markets… In practice, they rarely are asked to shut down. Several of the companies are being paid through these agreements [most] of the time they operate. Most years, they are asked to turn off for only a few hours, at which point they are paid even more.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not long ago, it was reported that <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/texas-paid-crypto-mining-firm-bit-deer-a-lot-of-money-to-shut-its-machines-off/" data-wpel-link="internal">Texas paid a specific bitcoin</a> mining company to shut down its systems during a time of heavy winter storms. Overall, that company made millions of dollars doing nothing over the course of several weeks. ERCOT says it’s not looking to discriminate against the types of companies looking to set up in Texas, nor does it have problems with firms looking to offer specific kinds of services. It said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We want to be able to serve any business that wants to do business in Texas, and that includes crypto miners.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ed Hirs – a University of Houston energy economist – believes that a lot of these excessive electricity practices seen in the mining industry in Texas are going to fall onto the shoulders of everyday citizens. He mentioned in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ironically, when people are paying the most for their power, or losing it altogether, the miners are making money selling energy back to Texans at rates 100 times what they paid.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Ordinary Citizens Bearing the Burden?</h2>
<p>A study performed by research firm Wood Mackenzie seconds this, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>Increased demand has caused electric bills for power customers to rise nearly five percent, or $1.8 billion per year. In West Texas, where several bitcoin mines have settled, bills have increased by nearly nine percent.</p></blockquote>

<li>The price is now trading below the $115 zone and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $115 on the 4-hour chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair could continue to move down if it stays below the $115 resistance zone.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Bitcoin cash price is declining below the $115s zone against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-eyes-another-increase-to-30k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a>. BCH/USD could extend losses if there is a close below $110.</em></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis</h2>
<p>Bitcoin cash price struggled to gain pace for a move above the $117 and $118 resistance levels. BCH formed a high near $117.41 and started a fresh decline.</p>
<p>There was a clear move below the $116.00 and $115.00 support levels. The pair even declined below the $112 support. It tested the $110 zone. A low is formed near $109.30 and the price is now consolidating losses. It is now trading above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $117.41 swing high to the $109.30 low.</p>
<p>Besides, it is trading below the $115 zone and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-cash-analysis-risk-of-fresh-drop-to-105/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. Immediate resistance is near the $113.50 level.</p>
<p>The 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $117.41 swing high to the $109.30 low is also near the $113.50 level. The next key resistance is near $115 and the trend line. Any more gains above $115 could set the pace for a move toward the $118 level.</p>
<p>If there is a move above the $118 resistance, the price could rise toward the $122 zone. If not, the price might continue lower below $111.</p>
<p>Immediate support on the downside is near the $110 zone. The next major support is near the $105 level, below which the bears might aim for $100.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bhutan is a small country lodged between India, Nepal, and China on the continent of Asia. Its biggest claims to fame are its architecture, its vast open landscapes… and the big crypto stash that the nation has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/iainmartin/2023/04/15/the-tiny-kingdom-of-bhutan-secretly-held-millions-of-dollars-in-cryptocurrency/?sh=275021ab7f1d" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">allegedly been hiding from</a> the world all this time.</p>
<h2>Bhutan Has Been Hiding a Lot of Crypto</h2>
<p>Bhutan is a miniscule and obscure nation. It also doesn’t appear to have all the technological advancements of its neighbors. The region only began supporting cell phone usage about 20 years ago, and in many areas, traffic lights are still absent or in the process of being put up. One wouldn’t assume that a country like Bhutan would be all that into crypto or the technology that supports it, but new court documents suggest otherwise.</p>
<p>These papers revealed that the sovereign investment arm of Bhutan was a big customer of both Block Fi and Celsius, two crypto lending platforms that <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/opinion-crypto-in-the-age-of-bankruptcy/" data-wpel-link="internal">went bust in 2022</a> (arguably the most bearish year on record for the crypto industry). The losses of the nation were never disclosed up until now. It is estimated that this investment division is worth just shy of $3 billion, meaning the country has more money stashed away than it’s been letting on all this time.</p>
<p>The investment firm is known as Druk Holding &amp; Investments. It’s believed the institution has been accumulating crypto since 2022, which is interesting because while the country was clearly able to gather millions of dollars in digital currency units over the course of a single year, it clearly chose the worst time to do so given how badly everything crashed during that time.</p>
<p>Right now, Druk says it’s sworn to secrecy about the matter of how much it’s lost, though it did say it engaged in a court battle with Block Fi that has since been settled. It’s not known how the money accumulated nor what the company was planning to do with all the funds. Druk’s CEO Ujjwal Deep Dahal commented in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>We do not have any comments as the matter with Block Fi has been settled. We are not able to comment due to confidentiality.</p></blockquote>
<p>Duncan Bonfield – chief executive of the International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds – also threw his two cents into the mix, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have seen no real interest in cryptocurrency as an asset class, and we do not believe any of our members have an allocation to crypto in their portfolios.</p></blockquote>
<h2>You Couldn&#8217;t Even Visit</h2>
<p>Bhutan is a relative newcomer to “modern society” and visitors in many ways. The nation could not be traveled to until 1974, and that only occurred as a means of building its economy through tourism.</p>
<p>Prior to that, the nation had fallen victim to a pandemic that prohibited all foreigners from entering.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anthony Scaramucci of Skybridge Capital says <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/anthony-scaramucci-says-he-is-more-bullish-on-bitcoin-now-than-ever-before-incredibly-sturdy-bizarrely-anti-fragile-asset-class/ar-AA19UgZq" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">he’s never been more</a> bullish on bitcoin as he is now.</p>
<h2>Scaramucci Has Good Reason to Love BTC</h2>
<p>In many ways, his words make sense, and Scaramucci has a big, giant reason to be bullish. After all, the world’s number one digital currency by market cap <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-rose-to-30k-in-mid-april-analysts-discuss-why/" data-wpel-link="internal">recently hit $30K for</a> the first time in about 11 months, and 2023 appears to be directing bitcoin on a healing path that’s likely to reverse all the damage done during the previous year, which was arguably the worst on record for BTC.</p>
<p>In a recent discussion, Scaramucci commented that bitcoin has been enduring some hardcore boom-bust cycles in which it goes up quite high then crashes down very low. He says this all coincides with the halving process, and how interesting (and coincidental, in many ways) bitcoin is going to endure another halving event next year in 2024.</p>
<p>He also says that the mainstream media has been giving bitcoin and crypto a lot more attention as of late. He commented that this is likely leading to a lot of the rising and falling we’re seeing in the BTC cycles. In addition, he says bitcoin wallets have never been available on such a large scale.</p>
<p>This, in turn, has led to a bit of an issue in that many fraud schemes have emerged in recent months and years, something that he feels has brought down the reputation and the legitimacy of the space. He commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>What happened almost right on time is the intersection of fraud and over-leverage, which always happens in the age of new technology… The technology that we have now can create a bee swarm.</p></blockquote>
<p>He says that there have been many elements leading up to the present anti-crypto stance taken by Gary Gensler, who heads the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Among them are the many crypto companies collapsing in America such as <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/" data-wpel-link="internal">FTX</a>, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/celsius-network-is-next-crypto-company-to-file-bankruptcy/" data-wpel-link="internal">Celsius</a>, and <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/block-fi-is-the-latest-crypto-company-to-go-bankrupt/" data-wpel-link="internal">Block Fi</a>.</p>
<p>Despite this, however, he’s convinced bitcoin is an “incredibly sturdy” and “anti-fragile asset class,” and he believes the currency is going to end the year in the $40,000 or $50,000 price range.</p>
<h2>Some Things Remain in the Way</h2>
<p>He further said that there are individuals out there that are going to do everything they can to bring bitcoin down. Among them are people like Charlie Munger – Warren Buffett’s right hand man – and Jamie Dimon, who’s the head of JPMorgan, arguably one of the biggest financial institutions in the world. Speaking about the latter, Scaramucci said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Jamie Dimon is probably the smartest person in financial services history since the original J.P. Morgan, and there&#8217;s no way if you got him unplugged and you got him with truth serum in him that he would say to you that bitcoin is a decentralized bedrock.</p></blockquote>
