					<description><![CDATA[On May 30, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that Ishan Wahi, the former Coinbase product manager, and his brother, Nikhil Wahi, had agreed to settle charges brought forth by the regulator accusing them of engaging in an insider trading scheme. SEC Settlement With Former Coinbase Product Manager In this way, the two defendants also agreed that their actions violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act.  Accordingly, Ishan has been sentenced to two years in prison, while his brother, Nikhil, will serve ten months behind bars. In a statement, the SEC also said the former Coinbase product manager forfeited 10.97 ETH and 9,440 USDT. On the other hand, Nikhil has submitted to the state 892,500 USDT.  Related Reading: Russia scraps plans for a national cryptocurrency exchange, as HedgeUp (HDUP) Prepares for world Domination migrating on Stellar This is part of the settlement and forfeiture of securities the SEC said were ill-gotten.

<p>In this way, the two defendants also agreed that their actions violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act. </p>
<p>Accordingly, Ishan has been sentenced to two years in prison, while his brother, Nikhil, will serve ten months behind bars.</p>
<p>In a statement, the SEC also said the former Coinbase product manager forfeited 10.97 ETH and 9,440 USDT. On the other hand, Nikhil has submitted to the state 892,500 USDT. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[XRP, one of the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, has been bullish since May 26th, outperforming most of the top 10 cryptocurrencies. This surge in price comes as investors have high expectations for the outcome of the ongoing SEC vs. Ripple Labs case. Related Reading: Trader Joe Goes All-In On Auto-Pools: Game-Changer For DeFi Investors? XRP Shatters 2-Year Trendline The recent uptrend in XRP is particularly significant as the cryptocurrency has just broken through a two-year trendline, a key technical indicator for traders and investors, according to the trader Jaydee. Per the analysis of Jaydee, In 2017, XRP experienced a significant breakout when it surpassed a two-year trendline. This breakout led to a massive increase in value for the cryptocurrency, with XRP seeing a surge of 504x over just one year. This means that if an investor had purchased XRP at the start of 2017, they would have seen a return on investment of more than 50,000% by the end of the year. If XRP were to experience a similar surge in value today, with the cryptocurrency currently trading at $0.5116, it could reach a value of $258 by 2024. However, it&#8217;s important to note that predicting future price movements in cryptocurrency markets is highly challenging, and many factors could impact the value of XRP. For example, the ongoing SEC vs. Ripple Labs case could significantly impact the token&#8217;s future price movements. If the case is resolved in Ripple Labs&#8217; favor, it could lead to increased adoption and investment in XRP. On the other hand, if the case is decided against Ripple Labs, it could lead to a decrease in demand for the cryptocurrency and a drop in its value. However, Jaydee believes that the cryptocurrency will not experience a surge of 504x shortly. According to the analyst, XRP&#8217;s market cap is too high to support such a significant increase in value. The token has a market cap of over $26 billion, making it the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.  Despite these uncertainties, many investors remain bullish on XRP&#8217;s prospects. The cryptocurrency has already seen significant adoption within the financial industry, with many major banks and payment processors using XRP for cross-border transactions.  Key Indicators Point To Significant Growth Potential According to the Average Sentiment Oscillator (ASO), the current set-up for XRP is highly bullish, with several key indicators pointing toward a strong upward trend in price. One key factor contributing to this bullish sentiment is the high volatility of XRP&#8217;s market depth, indicating significant interest and demand for the cryptocurrency.  Additionally, the current trend&#8217;s strength is strong, with a bullish cross indicating that XRP is likely to continue its upward trajectory, per a recent analysis by Egrag Crypto. While XRP has been ascending in the price for almost four months, there is still a major resistance level known by Egrag as the &#8216;Final Wake Up Line&#8217; that XRP has yet to break through. However, even if the token experiences a minor correction after a 20% pump, there are still possible support levels at $0.4810 and $0.4277 that could prevent a significant drop in value, according to Egrag Crypto’s latest analysis.  Related Reading: Coinbase CEO Drops Bombshell Prediction – Is China Set To Dominate Crypto? If XRP does dip below these support levels, it is considered normal and not necessarily a cause for concern as long as it respects its below lines as strong support in the near term.

					<description><![CDATA[The amount of funds flowing through the Avalanche Bridge is down 70% in the last 24 hours, DeFiLlama data on May 31 shows. 70% Drop In Activity In The Avalanche Bridge To Ethereum Over the past day, the bridge has facilitated $2,634,828 worth of transactions and processed $22.4 million in transfers in the last week. The bridge has processed 278 transactions in the past day, totaling around $2.6 million. It shows a sharp decrease in activity between Ethereum and Avalanche, among the world&#8217;s largest smart contract platforms. Related Reading: Trader Joe Goes All-In On Auto-Pools: Game-Changer For DeFi Investors? The Avalanche Bridge connects the Avalanche’s C-Chain, one of the three interoperable blockchains defining the low-finality platform, with Ethereum.  Since C-Chain is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), assets can be smoothly transferred from Avalanche to Ethereum and vice versa.  The compatibility with the EVM coupled with the decentralization of the bridge means users can move funds between the two blockchains securely.  Avalanche, unlike Ethereum, is explicitly designed for decentralized finance (DeFi) dApps. It boasts high processing speeds, relatively low fees, and is decentralized. However, it lags Ethereum in activity, judging from the total value locked (TVL).  According to DeFiLlama data, over $26.5 billion of the approximately $48 billion of all DeFi TVL is managed by dapps on Ethereum. More Assets Moved Between Avalanche And Bitcoin Notably, while there is a worrying contraction in the number of transactions and value between Avalanche and Ethereum, the Avalanche Core Bitcoin Bridge is booming.  On May 31, there was a significant increase in transfers and value, with a spike of 2,726%. Within 24 hours, assets worth over $6.5 million were transferred through the bridge. This is roughly half the average weekly transfers which stand at $13.81.  Bitcoin transferred to the Avalanche C-Chain from the Bitcoin network is tokenized and is compliant with the ERC-20 standard. In that case, it can be moved to Ethereum and used to participate in DeFi. Related Reading: Coinbase CEO Drops Bombshell Prediction – Is China Set To Dominate Crypto? Scanning the activities stemming from Avalanche to Bitcoin and Ethereum, the disparity could suggest that more users are moving their assets to and from Bitcoin.  However, no direct fundamental event could explain why more users are bridging tokens from Bitcoin and cutting down engagement with Ethereum. In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Avalanche prices have been under pressure, falling from recent highs. To illustrate, AVAX is down 6% from May 28 highs, extending losses from mid-April. AVAX is down 35% in the last six weeks and retesting March 2023 lows.  AVAX may slip below a critical multi-week support level if sellers double down. In that case, it could drop to December 2022 lows at around $10. Feature Image From Canva, Chart From TradingView]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin price action is at an impasse. Bulls and bears are divided as to what happens next, leading to months of consolidation. It could all come down to the next few days, according to the most important BTCUSD price chart you&#8217;ll see this week. The chart shows just how critical the stalemate in crypto markets is currently, and why this week could be the end of the indecision. Bitcoin Momentum Takes A Pause, But What&#8217;s Next? In technical analysis, the velocity of price increases or decreases can be measured by momentum. Various tools exist that get the job done, including the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator. The tool is designed to give overbought and oversold signals, plus buy and sell signals based on crossovers of the signal and MACD lines. Passing through the zero line is also an indication of momentum strengthening, as well as the underlying trend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Double Fractal Points To “Extended” Parabolic Rally It is for all these reasons and more that the chart below is so important. The chart consists of BTCUSD on the one-week timeframe. Underneath the price action is the LMACD – a logarithmic version of the MACD. The log version allows more comparative analysis between long-term cycles. At just a glance, it is easy to see that the tool appears ready to cross downward, generating a sell signal. The inflection point is visible in the LMACD &#124; BTCUSD on TradingView.com Below The Zero Line: Doom Or Redemption? What&#8217;s worse is the fact the sell signal will occur alongside a failure to hold above the zero line on the LMACD. Such a sign of momentum failure would more than likely lead to a retest of current bear market lows across crypto. However, the D in the indicator&#8217;s name stands for &#8220;divergence.&#8221; Signals are generated based on the tool converging or diverging. Diverging upward in Bitcoin, could send the crypto market blasting off higher instead. Related Reading: Down But Not Out: The One Line Bitcoin Must Hold To Be Bullish But beware. It is possible that both situations could happen before the week&#8217;s end. The LMACD could cross down and turn the histogram red for the first time in 2023 and shake out those eager to jump the gun on the sell signal. After the shakeout, the tool could diverge up before close and continue to push momentum and price to new highs. Alternatively, the tool could diverge upward at this inflection point, only to later cross back down. What is for certain is that the current lack of a decision in price direction is about to end, according to the LMACD. Tony is the author of the CoinChartist (VIP) newsletter.

<h2>Below The Zero Line: Doom Or Redemption?</h2>
<p>What&#8217;s worse is the fact the sell signal will occur alongside a failure to hold above the zero line on the LMACD. Such a sign of momentum failure would more than likely lead to a retest of current bear market lows across crypto. However, the D in the indicator&#8217;s name stands for &#8220;divergence.&#8221; Signals are generated based on the tool converging or diverging. Diverging upward in Bitcoin, could send the crypto market blasting off higher instead.</p>

<p>But beware. It is possible that both situations could happen before the week&#8217;s end. The LMACD could cross down and turn the histogram red for the first time in 2023 and shake out those eager to jump the gun on the sell signal. After the shakeout, the tool could diverge up before close and continue to push momentum and price to new highs. Alternatively, the tool could diverge upward at this inflection point, only to later cross back down. What is for certain is that the current lack of a decision in price direction is about to end, according to the LMACD.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Trader Joe, a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) on the Binance Smart Chain, is making waves in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) world with its new Auto-Pools feature. According to the DeFi researcher Tindorr, this innovative solution offers a set-and-forget yield farming strategy for liquidity providers (LPs), eliminating laborious position management.  Auto-Pools allows LPs to provide liquidity to multiple assets through Liquidity Books, with strategies built and hosted off-chain by the Trader Joe&#8217;s team in a &#8220;Black Box&#8221;. The scalability and adjustability of Auto-Pools make it a simple yet smart move by Trader Joe&#8217;s to outperform other emerging DEXs and ignite bullish sentiment for $JOE. Related Reading: Coinbase CEO Drops Bombshell Prediction – Is China Set To Dominate Crypto? Can Trader Joe&#8217;s Auto-Pools Ignite Bullish Sentiment? The combination of Liquidity Book and Auto-Pools provides capital efficiency and the best user experience approach for new DeFi users, attracting more liquidity to the protocol. With the current size of Trader Joe, it has a niche to capitalize on untapped areas in the DeFi market. While competitors are entering the market, being a first mover gives Trader Joe&#8217;s an advantage, with the main challenges for new protocols being liquidity and real usage. For LPs, the first Auto-Pool called &#8220;The General&#8221; will launch soon, automatically rebalancing and auto-compounding all associated fees and rewards. By staking $JOE, users can get $JOE and earn protocol revenue generated, with a significant Annual Percentage Rate (APR) of 22.7%.  The staked $JOE increased by 2x in just one week, indicating a strong bullish sentiment towards the token. DeFi researcher Tindorr believes that Trader Joe&#8217;s Auto-Pools have the potential to revolutionize the DeFi market. When trading within one bin, the one-click yield farming solution with zero-slippage trading could be a game-changer for DeFi investors seeking a solid product-market fit.  Furthermore, hosting the strategies off-chain gives Trader Joe&#8217;s a double-edged sword, with the ability to be highly scalable and dynamically adjustable but also requiring users&#8217; trust in the &#8220;Black Box&#8221; execution. Overall, Trader Joe&#8217;s Auto-Pools represents a pivotal moment for the DEX to outperform its competitors and attract more liquidity to the protocol. With its niche in untapped areas of the DeFi market, the combination of Liquidity Book and Auto-Pools offers capital efficiency and the best UX approach for new DeFi users.  The first Auto-Pool, &#8220;The General,&#8221; is set to launch soon, and with the increasing staked $JOE and high APR, it&#8217;s worth keeping an eye on Trader Joe&#8217;s future growth. Trader Joe And WOO Network Partner Up For A Revolutionary Omnichain Ecosystem Trader Joe and WOO Network have announced a strategic collaboration to strengthen the liquidity of the WOO token on Arbitrum and to expedite growth towards a joint vision of a unified, omnichain future. Per the announcement, this partnership brings together both platforms&#8217; resources and innovative capabilities to enhance market presence and drive innovation in the DeFi space. As part of the collaboration, WOO traders and liquidity providers can now trade and earn WOO on Trader Joe&#8217;s decentralized exchange through the Liquidity Book, one of the most capital-efficient automated market makers (AMMs) in DeFi. Liquidity Book offers zero-slippage swaps and provides liquidity providers unparalleled ease and flexibility in deployment and management, making it an ideal tool to help boost WOO to new heights.

					<description><![CDATA[Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has warned that the US risks ceding its global financial leadership and innovation hub status if it fails to recognize the transformative potential of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency.  In a recent interview with Market Watch, Armstrong urged policymakers and regulators to provide regulatory clarity to ensure consumer protection and realize the promise of crypto. Armstrong further claimed:  By enforcing restrictive policies, the U.S. is inadvertently driving crypto-innovation offshore. That shift will compromise America’s legacy of pioneering technological advancements, and weaken our national security posture. Brian Armstrong Warns U.S. Could Lose To China The Coinbase CEO emphasized that currency has always embodied innovation, from the earliest coins as physical stores of value that transitioned the human race from bartering to commerce to the advent of portable paper currency that bolstered lending and investments.  Related Reading: Indian Banks Urged To Embrace AI And Blockchain For Future Readiness Armstrong also notes that the technologically driven financial system of the 20th century, which was characterized by innovations such as credit cards, electronic transfers, and online banking, helped to make it the &#8220;American Century&#8221; &#8211; a period of US economic and political dominance. This highlights the importance of technological innovation in driving economic progress and global influence and suggests that the US must continue to lead in this area to maintain its position as a global economic leader. However, Coinbase CEO suggests that now the US and other democratic nations are up against digital systems promoted by an ambitious adversary, China. Armstrong revealed that China is promoting two Chinese tech behemoths, Alipay and Tencent, which offer integrated payment systems with direct, instant access to an array of services.  With the recent launch of its digital yuan, China aims to directly challenge the US dollar and its role in global commerce. Given these moves and China&#8217;s strategy to leverage financial technology to protect its national interests, Hong Kong is positioning itself as a global crypto hub. Coinbase CEO Urges US Congress To Seize Historic Opportunity Armstrong put forward that smart and bespoke regulation in the 1990s and early 2000s enabled the US to define the Internet Age. And just like then, now is the time for Congress to seize the historic opportunity presented by crypto, pass comprehensive legislation that safeguards consumers, and fosters innovation.  Moreover, he stressed that crypto has the potential to play a significant part in stimulating the American economy and promoting democratic values worldwide. &#8220;If the US falls short today, the next generation of Americans will pay the price,&#8221; the CEO said. Furthermore, Armstrong warned that if the US fails to recognize the transformative potential of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, it risks ceding its global financial leadership and innovation hub status to other countries.  Bringing crypto and blockchain innovation back to the US a decade from now will require a colossal and sustained effort that may not succeed. Therefore, Armstrong urged policymakers and regulators to work together to modernize the financial system and reaffirm the country&#8217;s role as a global technology leader rather than abdicating it. Related Reading: Optimism Crashes 33% Following Token Unlocks, Why There Could Be More Pain To Come He also acknowledged that traditional financial capitals, including the UK, United Arab Emirates, Brazil, Japan, the European Union, Australia, and Singapore, are also vying to become crypto hubs. He argued that the nexus between financial technologies and democratic values is integral to America&#8217;s identity. It&#8217;s why he decided to base Coinbase in the US. Overall, Armstrong highlights the potential of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency to revolutionize the financial system and other sectors, and the importance of the US in fostering innovation in this space.

					<description><![CDATA[Bali police have arrested a car rental owner in the state for accepting payments in crypto assets. The arrest came after the state government warned against using cryptocurrencies as payment options for any transaction. Bali Police Worked Undercover To Arrest Car Rental Business Owner While working undercover as customers, Bali police agents arrested an individual identified as TS (33) on May 29 in Jimbaran, Badung, in Bali, Indonesia. The Bali Police’s Cyber Unit started its investigations following increasing reports of people using crypto assets for transactions in the state. These include businesses like car rentals, cafes, hotels, property agencies, and others. Related Reading: Bullish Case For Litecoin Grows Stronger As LTC Halving Draws Close Chief of the Crime Investigation Unit Nanang Prihasmoko spoke to CNN Indonesia about the arrest. The unit chief stated that the police contacted the suspect as a potential renter by secretly infiltrating a car rental group on the Telegram app. The police then requested TS&#8217;s crypto wallet address for rental payment and set a physical meeting to conclude all arrangements.  Finally, the police arrested the car rental owner at the point of the meeting. Prihasmoko revealed that TS had started accepting crypto payments from foreigners on the island three months ago.  And following his arrest, the police seized some of the suspect’s assets, including his mobile phone used for crypto transactions. They also seized an Indodax account, a Pajero Sport vehicle, his ATM card, a Telegram account, and Telegram screenshots. According to Nanang, using any other currency for payments or financial obligations except the Indonesian rupiah violates Indonesian law. Offenders of such law could face one-year imprisonment and a penalty fine of IDR 200 million. Bali Warned Against Using Crypto For Payments The government of Bali has previously warned against the use of cryptocurrencies for payments in the region. In a statement by Bali Governor Wayan Koster, the ban on crypto payments cuts across different areas such as shopping, accommodations, restaurants, rentals, and other activities. Related Reading: Here Are The Top 3 Chinese Coins To Buy As China Leads The Bull Run The governor mentioned that anyone caught in the act would be strictly punished and the penalty could even include a forceful closure of the offenders&#8217; businesses in the state. Furthermore, Governor Koster extended the warning against crypto use to tourists and other foreigners within the island state. He said the state has zero tolerance for violating laws and improper actions from tourists. According to the governor, foreigners violating Balian laws could face deportation,  sanctions, or penalty fines. Indonesia only encourages the use of its local currency, the Indonesian rupiah. It is the only legal tender permitted for conducting transactions in the country. Featured image from Pixabay and chart from TradingView]]></description>
