<p>The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, with price fluctuations often sparking excitement and concern among investors. In this article, we examine the recent price drop of Litecoin (LTC) and the surge of Tradecurve, which has remained a favorite presale among investors.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s8">Litecoin (LTC) Sees a Bearish Downturn</p>
<p>Litecoin (LTC) has witnessed a recent price drop, causing concern among its bulls. In the last week alone, Litecoin saw a drop of 14.5% on the price charts. The decline in Litecoin's value can be attributed to various factors, including overall market sentiment and profit-taking by traders.</p>
<p>Litecoin has a value of $94.30 with a market cap of $6.9B, which is a drop of 2.43% in the last 24 hours. Not only that, the technical analysis for Litecoin also paints a bearish picture, with both its technical indicators and moving averages showing strong sell signals.</p>
<p>To predict how the current conflict between the bulls and the bears will turn out, traders are now paying particular attention to the $90-$92 price range. If it falls below that range, Litecoin may continue dropping to its support level of $85.</p>
<p class="s8">Tradecurve (TCRV) Seen As the Top Pick Among Investors</p>
<p>In contrast to Litecoin's downturn, the Tradecurve (TCRV) presale has experienced a surge in price, solidifying its position as a favorite among investors. The recent 20% surge in Tradecurve's price reflects growing confidence and interest from the investor community.</p>
