Shiba Inu (SHIB) kicked off the year aggressively as it rallied alongside other meme coins. However, as the year progresses, Shiba Inu has experienced a downward trend leaving investors wondering: should they hold or sell?  Shiba Inu coin&#8217;s value on Coingecko is currently at $0.00001027, experiencing a decrease of 3.4% over the last seven days and a more significant slump of 7.8% over the past two weeks. The question on every investor&#8217;s mind now is: what move should they make next with the meme coin? Source: Coingecko Key Levels To Watch For Shiba Inu For traders and investors who want to get a clear grasp of SHIB’s price trajectory, it’s important to remember that there are two key levels to consider: the support level and the resistance level. The support level is currently set at $0.0000095. Alternately, the resistance level, which is now at $0.00001 at the time of writing, signifies the price at which sellers are expected to enter the market and sell their SHIB holdings, hence exerting downward pressure on the price of the meme coin.

On the other hand, if the price rises over the $0.00001 resistance level, it can be a bullish indicator that buyers are flooding the market and pushing the price higher. As such, keeping a close eye on these key levels can help traders make informed decisions when buying or selling SHIB.
