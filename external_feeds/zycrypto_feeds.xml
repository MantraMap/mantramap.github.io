<p>The decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, Sturdy Finance, lost 442 ETH (approximately $765,000 at the time of this publication) due to a security vulnerability exploited by some hackers.</p>



<p>The blockchain security company, <a href="https://twitter.com/peckshield/status/1668067645638299648">PeckShield</a>, alerted the DeFi protocol on Twitter about fraudulent transactions through which attackers manipulated prices on the platform.</p>



<p>&#8220;We are aware of the reported exploit of the Sturdy protocol. All markets have been paused; no additional funds are at risk, and no user actions are required at this time,&#8221; affirmed Sturdy Finance.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sturdy-finance-loses-765-000-in-eth"><strong>Sturdy Finance loses $765,000 in ETH</strong></h2>



<p>The DeFi platform confirmed that it was a victim of the attack and sent a message to its users, assuring them that the necessary measures have been taken to prevent further funds from being stolen from the protocol.</p>



<p>However, the hacker managed to steal over $765,000 in ETH, which was sent to a cryptocurrency mixer.</p>



<p>According to the security firm <a href="https://twitter.com/BlockSecTeam/status/1668084629654638592">BlockSec</a>, the attacker of Sturdy Finance exploited the read-only reentrancy in the protocol&#8217;s price balancer to manipulate the price of the BstETH-STABLE pair.</p>



<p>&#8220;This technique is commonly used by <a href="https://zycrypto.com/hackers-steal-23-million-in-ether-shiba-inu-and-other-tokens-from-singaporean-exchange-bitrue/">hackers</a> to withdraw funds from DeFi protocols,&#8221; says BlockSec.</p>



<p>It involves taking advantage of the ability to repeatedly call a function in a single transaction before the first function call has been completed. Thanks to this, hackers can withdraw more money than should be possible.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Sturdy Finance hack exposes the vulnerability of DeFi platforms</strong></h2>



<p>Attacks on DeFi platforms have increased over time, leading many to consider this ecosystem a paradise for <a href="https://zycrypto.com/north-korean-hackers-linked-to-45-of-3-8-billion-crypto-theft-in-2022-chainalysis-reports/">hackers</a>. The theft of $625 million from Ronin Bridge and the $197 million stolen from <a href="https://zycrypto.com/euler-finance-197-million-hack-bears-links-with-north-korea-but-it-could-all-be-one-big-misdirection/">Euler Finance</a> are just examples of the vulnerability of these platforms.</p>



<p>Due to financial transactions in DeFi occurring on the blockchain without intermediaries, there is an inherent risk. This lack of regulation and decentralization makes decentralized finance platforms vulnerable to attacks.</p>



<p>Despite these challenges, DeFi has continued to evolve and demonstrate impressive growth. However, it is necessary for security also to evolve to create a safer environment for users.</p>

<ul>
<li>Top assets lost value this week, with ADA shedding 22% and market leader BTC plunging to new lows not recorded in months. </li>



<li>The wider market was hit with deep losses wiping off $40 billion from the total market cap in 24 hours.</li>



<li>Observers say the market had a slow adverse reaction to the Fed&#8217;s uncertain stance on interest rate hike before the full impact on Thursday.</li>
</ul>



<p>Bitcoin (BTC) dipped below $25,000 for the first time in three months after the Feds signalled more interest rate hikes could be implemented.</p>



<p>The digital asset market was a sea of red as many coins posted weekly losses. Leading the losses in the top 20 by market capitalization was Polygon (MATIC), which plunged 24.1% and 8% in the past 24 hours. Solana (SOL) recorded a loss of 22.8% to trade at $14.54. </p>



<p>The past seven days have seen Cardano (ADA) lose slight gains it picked up this month. The community dubbed <em>ETH Killer </em>shed 22% of its value this week and 7% over the past 24 hours. XRP also saw a price correction after its community went into a frenzy following the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-demands-investigation-into-former-sec-director-hinman-and-his-controversial-speech/">revelation</a> of the Hinman documents. XRP exchanges hands at $0.475 after losing 5.44% in the past week. </p>



<p>Other altcoins posted huge losses, including Polkadot (DOT), BNB, Avalanche (AVAX) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), which recorded losses of 13.96%, 12.4%, 19.4%, and 17%, respectively. BTC bulls were left stunned after the asset dropped below the $25,000 mark for the first time in three months. At press time, BTC trades at $24,950, with several on-chain metrics pointing upwards for the asset. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-feds-keep-market-on-edge"><strong>Feds keep market on edge</strong></h2>



<p>At the release of the recent Consumer Protection Index (CPI), the entire market anticipated a renewed push for most assets as many predicted the Feds would end the 14-month hike in interest rates. Although interest rates were maintained after positive inflation data, the Feds noted that rates could still go up towards the end of the year.</p>



<p>A rate hike is detrimental to the market as it blunts investor excitement leading to a departure from risky assets. According to Josh Gilbert, an eToro market analyst.</p>



<p>“<em>Much of the positivity we’ve seen from risk assets this year, including Bitcoin, is built on the expectation that inflation will fall and interest rates will peak, and then begin to be cut. Inflation is moving in the right direction but the comments from Jerome Powell signify that rates could stay higher for longer, which would put Bitcoin on the back foot,” </em>he explained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The stock market also reacted similarly to cryptocurrencies following comments from the Feds as both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq dropped points.</p>

<p>Latest on-chain data shows the Ripple network is expanding as the number of new XRP addresses increases.</p>



<p>According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, these increases in addresses usually signal a potentially significant price growth.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/cuwa9LGQxoGDiSDABAaQ6P2zrC3ytnAdD_LAlZfP4eUYi9IDwgs4plhQeeKgQgWr20ihEioYpj3HWG2aApmQJPAnuTWw7_-NUlFwn3egazCFnULKOmG2g8nN04X7jU3FmcIThKzTMEbgCpQ3YASMuBg" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Network Growth (XRP). Source: Santiment</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-xrp-preparing-for-its-next-rally"><strong>Is XRP preparing for its next rally?</strong></h2>



<p>As <a href="https://zycrypto.com/a-new-boom-for-xrp-record-breaking-address-activity-indicates-upturn-ahead-to-1-xrp-price/">reported</a> by ZyCrypto, the surge in new addresses helped drive the price of XRP above the psychological resistance of $0.50, reaching a peak of $0.056 on Tuesday as the XRP Army continue to envison the $10 price point.</p>



<p>Although the increase in addresses could be a bullish signal suggesting the next XRP rally, it&#8217;s not a completely reliable indicator.</p>



<p>Investors focus on the outcome of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple, alleging that XRP is a Security. Recently, District Judge Annalisa Torres ordered the inclusion of former SEC director William Hinman&#8217;s speech in the case documents, where he stated that Ether is not a Security token.</p>



<p>The use of these documents is crucial for Ripple in the case, as it could help the company demonstrate that, like ETH, XRP is not a security token.</p>



<p>Additionally, a victory in the Ripple lawsuit could have significant implications for the price of XRP and the cryptocurrency market as a whole. According to several experts, Ripple and its token are undervalued, considering the company&#8217;s reserves exceed four times its market value. Furthermore, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-contemplates-ipo-as-sec-lawsuit-finally-nears-end-will-it-propel-xrp-to-10/">Ripple has expressed its desire to go public</a>, generating significant interest from institutional investors.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>XRP retreats 7.4%</strong></h2>



<p>Today, the price of XRP experienced a 5.4% retreat, according to CoinGecko data, following the recent <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">SEC lawsuit</a> against Binance.US, Binance International, and Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao. The lawsuit alleges that the exchange allowed North American users to use the international platform without regulatory permission to operate an unauthorized security token.</p>



<p>Furthermore, they were accused of using unauthorised user funds, transferring them to other international entities, thus evading federal laws.</p>



<p>However, despite the current decline of XRP, several indicators, such as moving averages, VPVP, and ADX, among others, continue to project a bullish trend on daily timeframes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/y4Usp67GHk8PYDgNKdZHdJvr75RaboxyhU9wEsPhZwcDCGogmJqrOdrFk2vlsgYeASGHUBwLxO7yVmttjkQNNgSomeMdYZEgXzY0qjqWY8q7O6Ybz-yYcgJ90yR7977eKy-8PPLXD2PpCSU4SsK95Uk" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Therefore, XRP needs to respect the support zone to maintain its bullish movement above $0.45. If it stays above that zone in the coming days, it could likely target the next resistance at $0.60 in the short term.</p>

<p>Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value, has continued to trade sluggishly since mid-April, with last week’s regulatory scares pushing its price below $26,000.</p>



<p>However, since Monday, the top cryptocurrency has exhibited unexpected resilience, with investors temporarily setting aside concerns over Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuits against <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-attorney-is-ready-to-go-to-bat-for-binance-coinbase-users-in-fight-against-sec/">Binance and Coinbase</a> and turning their attention to the upcoming Federal Reserve&#8217;s interest rate decision.</p>



<p>Notably, the retracement of Bitcoin, especially since last year&#8217;s decline, has generated a surge of curiosity, enticing many investors to seize the opportunity by purchasing the dip.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, blockchain analytics firm Glassnode reported that Bitcoin &#8220;Shrimps&#8221; and &#8220;Crabs&#8221; have increased their holdings significantly, accumulating nearly 1 million BTC since the collapse of the cryptocurrency LUNA in May 2022. <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-enters-full-accumulation-season-with-shrimps-and-whales-seizing-their-share-of-the-pie/">Shrimps</a> are entities that hold less than 1 BTC while crabs are those that own less than 10 BTC.</p>



<p><em>“Following the LUNA collapse, Bitcoin entities with less than 10 BTC (Shrimps &#8211; Crab) have shown their resilience, increasing their relative share of the circulating supply from 13.72% to 17.54%, a 3.82% increase equivalent to +790K BTC.”</em> Tweeted Glassnode.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lG0Q26l4_QhC6JpG3_ykps1Eq0s5rKP4WuQvJyc4BlO8AohPpmMccbKEO8nhq-CQKY-3d0j34SfZQKSS93pWyojIInA0F49ZbuU2FnaamoYT6fLES2CuJE7WEW5IkUo-4rlZn9R8UxPgwoCcu4Cz2g" alt=""/></figure>



<p>But this is not the only cohort that is buying the dip. Another firm, Santiment, noted a bullish trend in Bitcoin&#8217;s accumulation patterns despite the falling price. As the altcoin market experienced a frenzy, Santiment highlighted a divergence between Bitcoin&#8217;s accumulating whales and the declining price.</p>



<p>According to the firm, Whale holdings in Bitcoin increased by approximately 1,000 BTC daily, indicating that more prominent investors were accumulating more Bitcoin even as prices dropped.</p>



<p><em>“With whale holdings moving up by ~1K $BTC per day while prices fall, there is reason to believe a strong rebound can occur,”</em> tweeted the firm.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, other Bitcoin metrics also seem to be <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoins-on-chain-metrics-in-excellent-shape-despite-price-plunge-analyst-says/">improving</a>. According to Glassnode data, Bitcoin&#8217;s short-term holders have experienced a significant profit-driven phase since the start of the year. However, as the spot price of Bitcoin continued to trend lower, the STH (Short-Term Holders) Realized Profit/Loss Ratio has now approached a critical decision point, indicating an equilibrium position.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9MfOwnWqN4ytYZ56RRY10sansYroK7p8BMw6_UrXm0lqLWgoCShHq0gPeo1PMKSxlJbLILoXrf-sCtqr2pRBY_YsXnFs1m6mx4hFEtPC4TSNkN4dv7Q86NhgdHW9Rn7lf58R1e05M1rs1b0YcByqRA" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Glassnode suggested on Tuesday that a bounce off the equilibrium position “would be considered constructive”, signalling support for Bitcoin. Conversely, if the ratio decisively falls below the equilibrium point, it would indicate market weakness and the possibility of more price drops. The market thus awaits this pivotal moment to assess the future trajectory of Bitcoin.</p>



<p>At press time, BTC was trading at $25,114, down 3% in the past 24 hours. Notably, Bitcoin&#8217;s current price range is regarded as robust support. Further, the presence of a bullish flag pattern and inverse head and shoulders patterns suggest the possibility of an upcoming bullish rally.</p>

<p>Hours after the public release of the infamous William Hinman emails, cryptocurrency payments service provider Ripple called for a thorough investigation into the former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) director Bill Hinman and his now-released June 2018 speech, in which he said bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) were not securities, in his view.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hinman-should-be-probed-ripple"><strong>Hinman Should Be Probed: Ripple</strong></h2>



<p>Documents tied to William Hinman, the former director of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s Division of Corporation Finance from 2017 to 2020, were <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-primed-for-massive-upsurge-as-sec-case-tilts-in-ripples-favor-amid-huge-reveal-of-hinman-docs/">released to the public</a> Tuesday, shedding some light on the internal deliberations among SEC staffers that happened at the time.</p>



<p>And Ripple’s chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty calls for a fresh investigation into Hinman. In a <a href="https://twitter.com/s_alderoty/status/1668601239536390144">series of tweets</a> on Tuesday, Alderoty explained the need to uncover the reasons behind his infamous ether speech and the application of the Howey test.</p>



<p>In that speech given in 2018, Hinman declared that Ethereum (ETH) shouldn’t be categorized as a security because it was “sufficiently decentralized,” something that caused bewilderment when the SEC later filed a lawsuit against Ripple for allegedly selling $1.3 billion worth of XRP tokens as unregistered securities.</p>



<p>Alderoty inferred Hinman had overstepped his bounds by creating law without the authority.</p>



<p>“Unelected bureaucrats must faithfully apply the law within the constraints of their jurisdiction. They can’t — as Hinman tried — create new law.“</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Hinman Issue</strong></h2>



<p>Looking at the behind-the-scenes edits and correspondence about the speech, Alderoty notes that the ex-director “invented factors” that should be considered when deciding what “sufficiently decentralized” actually is.</p>



<p>The legal officer said the docs demonstrated that Hinman ignored multiple warnings that the speech contained “made-up analysis with no basis in law” and caused “greater confusion” in the cryptocurrency market.</p>



<p>Besides launching a probe into Hinman, Alderoty pressed the SEC also to remove the speech from its website. He further urged that the speech should no longer be invoked in discussions about whether or not a token is a security.</p>



<p>“Despite the SEC repeatedly flip-flopping on the significance of the speech in litigation, it remains on the agency’s website,” the Ripple chief legal officer posited.</p>

<p>There’s a rumour going around Twitter claiming that Binance has been secretly selling Bitcoin to keep its BNB token afloat. Binance chief executive officer Changpeng Zhao has quickly dispelled the speculation, proclaiming that no BTC or BNB trading activity is happening behind the scenes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cz-rebukes-claims-of-secretly-selling-btc-to-prop-up-bnb"><strong>CZ Rebukes Claims Of Secretly Selling BTC To Prop Up BNB</strong></h2>



<p>On Tuesday, popular crypto trader going by the online alias 52kskew accused Binance of intentionally manipulating the market to keep the prices of BNB from dropping below certain levels.</p>



<p>“USDT reserves have been pumped into BNB aggressively since 27th May. BNB is being sold off for BUSD to suppress volatility in BTC,” 52kskew astutely <a href="https://twitter.com/52kskew/status/1668726427703996418">noted</a>. “BUSD is pumped into BTC to suppress downside volatility so BTC can be swapped out for USDT.”</p>



<p>Similarly, trader JW100x claimed that Binance is determined to keep the price of BNB above $220 at all costs to prevent a “liquidation waterfall”. JW100x described the practice of selling spot Bitcoin to stabilize the value of BNB as a “total house of cards”, pointing to the potential for market destabilization.</p>



<p>Joe Consorti, a market analyst at The Bitcoin Layer, also <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeConsorti/status/1668723869794926595">described </a>BNB’s price action as “unusual”, with the “$220 level” being “staunchly defended.” He indicated that it might be a liquidation zone for a BNB-collateralized loan.</p>



<p>CZ felt compelled to quickly respond to these allegations on Twitter, dismissing them as FUD via his infamous “4” moniker. For those who don’t know, FUD stands for “fear, uncertainty, and doubt.” The crypto community has long used the pejorative to portray what they deem as misconceptions or exaggerations circulated by crypto foes to scare off investors, regulators, and the general public.</p>



<p>According to the Binance boss, Binance has not sold any BTC or BNB. He added that the exchange still holds a bag of the FTX (FTT) token, a popular crypto asset issued by the now-defunct FTX digital asset exchange.</p>



<p>Zhao further <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1668735411705765893">accused</a> the Crypto Twitter members of supposedly spreading the rumours of self-serving intentions: “Maybe they are shorting… who knows.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Fresh Binance FUD Or Facts?</strong></h2>



<p>CZ’s emphatic rebuff, however, has been met with harsh skepticism from the cryptoverse, with Consorti <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeConsorti/status/1668741759629762561">prompting </a>Binance to publish an audited statement proving that it doesn’t have any BNB-collateralized liabilities in order for the FUD to go away.</p>



<p>In the highly volatile crypto world, such grave allegations could shake market confidence and attract further regulatory scrutiny. Notably, the rumours come as the global exchange is mired in a legal spat with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over allegations of considerable malfeasance and federal securities violations at its Binance.US unit.</p>



<p>Earlier today, a federal judge refused to order a temporary restraining order freezing Binance.US’s assets. This will allow the U.S. arm of the firm to continue doing business while hashing out limitations with the agency.</p>



<p>Whether Binance will provide evidence to corroborate CZ&#8217;s claims or if these allegations will further taint the company’s reputation remains to be seen.</p>

<p>After much legal wrangling, Ripple Labs finally released Hinman documents earlier yesterday that showed behind-the-scenes edits and correspondence about a speech the former director of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s Division of Corporation Finance gave in 2018, in which he said that, while cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether may start off as securities, they can become commodities once they become sufficiently decentralized.</p>



<p>While most XRP advocates believed the emails and internal SEC messages would significantly help Ripple in its ongoing legal fight with the agency, Gabriel Shapiro, the general counsel at investment firm Delphi Labs has burst their bubble.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-do-the-hinman-emails-really-help-ripple"><strong>Do The Hinman Emails Really Help Ripple?</strong></h2>



<p>Shapiro <a href="https://twitter.com/lex_node/status/1668585963893710849">lambasted </a>the emails as a “nothingburger” that revealed nothing new that would be valuable to Ripple’s case. &#8220;I&#8217;d love it if this helped Ripple&#8217;s case, but it just doesn&#8217;t,&#8221; opined Shapiro. The legal expert pointed out that the documents, which show that Hinman planned to have a conversation with Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin in the 2018 pre-speech, do not change anything.</p>



<p>The emails support Hinman’s belief that ether could not be classed as a security. Per Shapiro, the planned conversation with Buterin was widely known among cryptocurrency attorneys for years.</p>



<p>Shapiro admitted that the unsealing of the controversial documents tied to William Hinman is helpful to Ripple’s fair notice defense. Still, he also stressed that the contents of these emails do not provide bombshell arguments for the blockchain company’s case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In December 2020, the SEC <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">filed a lawsuit</a> accusing Ripple of raising more than $1.3 billion via an unregistered securities offering with its own XRP cryptocurrency. Ripple claims Hinman’s comments at the time indicate XRP should not be considered a security — which could result in a favourable outcome for the blockchain payments company.</p>



<p>Shapiro, however, noted that the extra mark-ups in the Hinman documents offer an interesting perspective of how different SEC personnel were thinking at the time.</p>



<p>Another skeptic is crypto critic-cum-podcaster Bennett Tomlin, who <a href="https://twitter.com/BennettTomlin/status/1668604389441822720">noted</a>:</p>



<p><em>“Imagine having enough $XRP bags in 2023 that you end up thinking these emails are exciting. You’ve had years to correct your position and still ended up here.”</em></p>



<p>While the securities lawyer and Bennett shredded any XRPArmy euphoria surrounding the documents, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse believes these emails will <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-ripple-ceo-garlinghouse-says-hinman-docs-are-well-worth-the-wait-ahead-of-unsealing-today/">play a key role</a> in the SEC’s suit.</p>



<p>In his <a href="https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1668601650242809857">Twitter thread</a>, Garlinghouse postulated it&#8217;s &#8220;absolutely unconscionable&#8221; that Hinman moved forward with his speech while editors at the agency thought what he was about to say was a bad idea. He said it&#8217;s even more disturbing that the SEC sued Ripple and its top executives, &#8220;when their own Division Head deliberately created confusion about this.&#8221;</p>



<p>After the emails were released to the public, the price of XRP spiked from 53 cents to 56 cents before settling at around 51 cents at publication time, according to data from CoinGecko.</p>

<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has intensified efforts towards regulating crypto in the country. This is in spite of a lack of regulatory clarity, which has made it impossible for crypto companies to know what is expected of them.</p>



<p>While the commission has always taken a stand against the crypto industry, it has invested more to clamp down on crypto this year than ever. One of the arguments the SEC holds is that all crypto assets &#8211; except Bitcoin &#8211; are securities, and all exchanges that trade them should be registered under the commission as securities exchanges.</p>



<p>Ripple and XRP were the first to face a lawsuit on the matter, and the case has been ongoing since 2020. This time, top crypto exchanges <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-attorney-is-ready-to-go-to-bat-for-binance-coinbase-users-in-fight-against-sec/">Binance and Coinbase were dragged to court</a> within 24 hours, and while the case is on, the question is will crypto exchanges ultimately be forced to register with the SEC?</p>



<p>A group of strategists with JPMorgan, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou says this is possible. In a note on Thursday last week, they wrote:</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Eventually, the SEC position might be confirmed by lawmakers and Coinbase, Binance.US and other U.S. exchanges would have to register as brokers and most cryptocurrencies would be treated as securities.”</em></p>



<p><em>“This could be more onerous and more costly for the crypto industry but there could be positives as well, as crypto markets would be subjected to similar regulations applied to traditional markets such as equities and thus offer more transparency and investor protection,&#8221;</em> the note added.</p>



<p>Most crypto enthusiasts would argue that such a move will compromise everything that crypto stood for &#8211; the minimized scrutiny of the space, which gives investors the liberty of controlling their own money.</p>



<p>The strategists at JPMorgan are however hopeful that this push by the SEC could eventually force legislators to come up with proper regulation for the industry. &#8220;it would clear the industry from bad practices and bad actors, which in turn is necessary for the industry to mature and see more institutional participation,&#8221; they said.</p>



<p>The outcome of the case will, however, be determined by the conclusion on whether cryptocurrencies are securities or not, and the Ripple case will play a pivotal role in answering this question.</p>

<p>The past week has brought forth a series of regulatory uncertainties and price drops for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>Over the past seven days, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization lost slightly over 4% following an intense battle initiated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission against the world’s two largest crypto exchanges.</p>



<p>Amidst this tumultuous period, on Sunday, May 11, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode reported significant <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-falls-below-26000-amid-regulatory-concerns-debt-ceiling-predictions-whats-next-for-btc/">Bitcoin</a> outflows from miners to exchanges providing further evidence to support the ongoing sell-off. As per the firm, Bitcoin miners sent many coins to exchanges in the past week, with the largest inflow reaching $70.8 million. However, although this represents the third-largest inflow on record, it falls short of the peak inflow of $101 million witnessed during the primary bull market in 2021, the firm said.</p>



<p>However, despite these negative aspects, other on-chain metrics offered a more optimistic outlook for Bitcoin. JA Marrtuum, an analyst at Cryptoquant, highlighted the continuous decline in exchange reserves, indicating a decreasing supply of Bitcoin available for trading. Notably, this trend contributes to the narrative of increasing scarcity, which historically has been a catalyst for price appreciation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/J7FDLopabQT86x60CPz5UeM1ezMMsxxqlyRakpwxzdVsmsHzvOPE9vbp-lB2SLtEQGaLdAeSJXLOcZ1fKZf1W-luqle9hSvD8CpTaNE2dn6xstHMMpzUP9lLX6EtkHD2HtR1IY38TwnSi1zcuAwx8w" alt=""/></figure>



<p>He also noted that the percentage of Bitcoin held by long-term holders remains steady compared to previous cycles. According to him, this suggests that despite short-term market volatility, a significant portion of Bitcoin holders remains confident in the long-term prospects of the cryptocurrency.</p>



<p><em>When we analyze Bitcoin from an on-chain perspective, it appears to be in excellent shape. In fact, it looks better than ever before,”</em> said Marrtuum adding, <em>“If you still have doubts, remember the old saying in the stock market: &#8220;When in doubt, zoom out.&#8221; When we take a broader view of the situation, it looks fantastic.”</em></p>



<p>From a technical analysis standpoint, Bitcoin&#8217;s price is currently hovering around a critical support level. Analyst &#8220;Captain Faibrik&#8221; highlighted a falling wedge pattern, emphasizing the importance of defending the crucial trendline support. According to the pundit, Bitcoin bulls need to regain the $27,000 resistance level for bullish momentum to start. However, if the major trendline support is not maintained, there is a possibility of a bearish rally of approximately 15% in the coming days, he warned.</p>



<p>Another analyst, &#8220;Cryptocator,&#8221; focused on the short-term outlook for Bitcoin, emphasizing key levels to watch. He says channel resistance at $27,200 and support at $25,400 are crucial price levels. Failure to hold the support could lead to a further drop to $24,800 or $24,700. However, he said a break above $26,300 might signal a potential recovery.</p>



<p>At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $25,886, up 0.21% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data.</p>

<p>The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has unveiled the hackers&#8217; identities behind the infamous Mt. Gox cryptocurrency exchange hack of 2011.</p>



<p>In a Friday statement, the DOJ announced that Russian nationals Alexey Bilyuchenko and Aleksandr Verner had been charged with conspiring to launder approximately 647,000 bitcoins stolen from <a href="https://zycrypto.com/big-btc-crash-ahead-mt-gox-creditors-to-be-paid-in-bitcoin-after-making-over-2000-gains/">Mt. Gox</a>. Additionally, Bilyuchenko was charged with operating the illicit cryptocurrency exchange BTC-e from 2011 to 2017 in collaboration with Alexander Vinnik. The Mt. Gox hack was a significant event in the cryptocurrency industry, leading to the exchange&#8217;s insolvency.</p>



<p>The DOJ&#8217;s indictment alleges that Bilyuchenko and Verner, along with their co-conspirators, gained unauthorized access to Mt. Gox&#8217;s server in September 2011 and fraudulently transferred the stolen bitcoins from the exchange wallets to addresses controlled by themselves and their co-conspirators over about three years. Moreover, the two were also charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering, with Bilyuchenko facing an additional charge of operating an unlicensed money services business.</p>



<p>Additionally, the DOJ alleged that Bilyuchenko and his co-conspirators operated a digital currency exchange that enabled criminals worldwide, including hackers, ransomware actors, narcotics rings, and corrupt public officials, to launder billions of dollars. The DOJ then expressed its commitment to identifying cybercriminals regardless of their location, emphasizing that Bilyuchenko and his co-conspirators will face justice for the harm caused to communities.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Alexey Bilyuchenko and Aleksandr Verner thought they could outsmart the law by using sophisticated hacks to steal and launder massive amounts of cryptocurrency, but the charges unsealed demonstrate our ability to tenaciously pursue these alleged criminals until they are brought to justice.” </em>Said Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York.</p>



<p>In a separate indictment unsealed in the Northern District of California (NDCA), Bilyuchenko was accused of working with Alexander Vinnik and others to operate the BTC-e exchange from 2011 until its closure in July 2017. Notably, BTC-e was one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges globally and served as a means for cybercriminals to transfer, launder, and store the proceeds of their illegal activities.</p>



<p>Mt. Gox ceased operations in 2014 after the extent of the theft was revealed, impacting the credibility and trust in the cryptocurrency industry. That said, creditors of the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox are set to receive compensation following the approval of a rehabilitation plan.</p>



<p>The plan, accepted by a significant majority of voting rehabilitation creditors, aims to reimburse victims, with eligible ones receiving approximately 90% of their assets. On Wednesday, June 7, the rehabilitation plan became “final and binding”, officially opening the window for compensation. However, although there has been no soft date set for the distribution, the plan is expected to be finalized before year-end, according to a previous communique.</p>

<p>Gary Gensler may have refused to say if ether and other cryptocurrencies are securities in the recent past — but the now-chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) certainly appeared confident about their security status back in 2018.</p>



<p>A video is making rounds on Twitter showing Gensler speaking at a conference organized by <em>Bloomberg </em>for institutional investors. Gensler was a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology at the time, with the 2018 event preceding his nomination as chairman of the SEC by roughly two years.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://twitter.com/twobitidiot/status/1668328519334780928">video</a>, Gensler, a civilian at the time and speaking only in his capacity as a professor, says “Three-quarters of this [crypto] market is probably not securities.” He used Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash as specific examples, even stating, “Why did I name those four? They’re not securities.”</p>



<p>To catch you up, a security is a tradable financial asset with monetary value, such as stocks or bonds, that satisfies the infamous Howey Test. According to U.S. law, an asset meets the legal definition of a security if it is an investment of funds in a common enterprise from which there is an expectation of profit based on the efforts of others.</p>



<p>The clip of Gensler’s talk at the <em>Bloomberg </em>conference is one of many that have recently surfaced on Twitter. Still, in 2018, while giving a lecture at MIT, the now SEC boss affirmed that ether was not a security in the eyes of the Securities and Exchange Commission. </p>



<p>It’s a statement that totally contradicts most recent comments as chairman of the SEC in which he <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-chair-gary-gensler-indirectly-declares-ether-is-a-security/">says </a>besides bitcoin, which is a commodity, all other tokens in the crypto market are securities. Gensler has also launched a war against crypto exchanges — like Bittrex, Kraken, Binance, and Coinbase — claiming that they allow the trading of unregistered securities.</p>



<p>Some Republican lawmakers in the U.S. have criticized Gensler for his latest enforcement actions that are obviously stifling innovation in the world’s biggest economy and forcing a slew of tech companies to relocate overseas. Congressmen Rep. Davidson and Rep. Emmer have even <a href="https://zycrypto.com/pro-crypto-lawmakers-officially-introduce-legislation-to-oust-sec-chair-gary-gensler/">introduced a new bill</a> to remove Gensler from office.</p>

<p>XRP, the native cryptocurrency for the Ripple network, has witnessed an impressive surge following the public release of the highly anticipated Hinman documents.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, the popular cryptocurrency soared over 7% to tap $0.5650 at noon.&nbsp;This price movement was met with enthusiasm from investors, as the reveal is a significant development in the ongoing legal dispute between the cryptocurrency firm and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>



<p>In a tweet, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-ripple-ceo-garlinghouse-says-hinman-docs-are-well-worth-the-wait-ahead-of-unsealing-today/">expressed his optimism</a> about the potential influence of these documents on the lawsuit, saying he believes “they were well worth the wait.”</p>



<p>The infamous Hinman documents consist of internal communication within the SEC related to a speech delivered in 2018 by William Hinman, the former Director of the Corporation Finance division. In the speech, Hinman stated that Ether was not a security. Ripple has always insisted that these documents will be crucial, shedding light on the SEC&#8217;s perspective on cryptocurrencies, particularly Ether and XRP.</p>



<p>Expressing his gratification, Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, <a href="https://twitter.com/s_alderoty/status/1668601229688324097">noted</a> that the public could finally get a glimpse at what occurred behind the scenes. According to the lawyer, the documents reveal that Hinman disregarded multiple warnings regarding the speech&#8217;s fabricated analysis, which lacked a legal foundation and failed to consider the Howey factors.</p>



<p>Stuart argued that these factors, created by Hinman to determine when a token becomes &#8220;sufficiently decentralized&#8221;, were seen as introducing confusion and regulatory gaps within the market. He noted that despite the agency exhibiting inconsistent positions on the speech&#8217;s significance in litigation, it remains accessible on the SEC&#8217;s website. This is despite the SEC insisting that the documents were Hinman’s opinion.</p>



<p>Stuart concluded by calling for the immediate removal of the speech from the SEC&#8217;s website, investigating potential influences on Hinman, and reassessing the speech&#8217;s validity in discussions around the classification of tokens.&nbsp;He emphasized the need for unelected officials to faithfully apply existing laws rather than attempting to create new ones, as Hinman seemingly did.</p>



<p>It is important to note that as the legal dispute between Ripple and the SEC approaches its conclusion, the contents of Hinman’s documents can tilt the scales in favour of Ripple.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, apart from the public release of the Hinman documents, the crypto market has also been reacting to two other <a href="https://zycrypto.com/australia-based-lawyer-bill-morgan-tells-us-exactly-why-june-13-will-be-a-monumental-day-for-crypto/">notable events</a>. Today, the US Court of Appeals for the third circuit ordered the SEC to clarify a rulemaking petition by Coinbase.</p>



<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-vs-sec-stakes-just-got-higher-following-binance-coinbase-lawsuits-as-xrp-win-proves-pivotal/">Binance US</a> is also expected to challenge the SEC&#8217;s request to freeze its assets. The exchange filed a motion in court on Monday, June 12, stating that complying with the SEC&#8217;s request would put it out of business if granted.</p>

<ul>
<li>The SEC has asked a US court for an order to temporarily freeze assets linked to Binance.US as it prosecutes its case against the company. </li>



<li>The Commission also seeks an expedited discovery period and substituted service instead of the traditional physical service.</li>



<li>The crypto community and industry executives have stood in solidarity with Binance, heavily criticizing the SEC. </li>
</ul>



<p>The digital asset market is under intense regulatory fire from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with Binance and Coinbase at the fore. Experts say this might only be the surface.</p>



<p>Barely a day after the SEC filed a lawsuit against Binance, the Commission is now looking to seize its assets to protect users. According to the filing made at the DC District Court, the SEC has asked the judge to freeze assets belonging to Binance.US through two companies. </p>



<p>The two impacted companies, BAM Management US Holdings and BAM Trading Services, act as the holding and operational firms for Binance US. The motion also requests that funds held by the two companies be returned to their customers, whether in fiat or digital assets.</p>



<p>If the motion is granted, funds overseas will be repatriated to the United States, and the companies, along with CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ), would show cause against a pending preliminary injunction. In addition, the motion mandates Binance US to preserve all records without destroying, mutating, or altering anything.</p>



<p>The Commission wants the whole process expedited “<em>to ensure the safety of customer assets and prevent the dissipation of available assets for any judgment” </em>and will institute substituted service instead of the traditional physical method. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-community-roots-for-binance"><strong>Community roots for Binance</strong></h2>



<p>Binance has received much support from the digital asset community and industry executives following its regulatory battle with the SEC. The company, in its response, stated that it would “<em>vigorously” </em>defend its reputation, debunking all allegations. </p>



<p>The move to seize Binance.US assets has faced initial criticisms around digital assets spaces on social media. Shark Tank’s Kevin O’Leary expressed that the move will starve Binance of oxygen, adding that the entire sector may need to find another haven. </p>



<p>In reaction to Gary Gensler’s comments on the similarities between Binance US and FTX, crypto enthusiasts have fired back, asking Gensler why FTX was not sued and Binance being unfairly targeted. Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse noted that the recent attack of Binance was a ploy to “<em>distract users from how it handled FTX.”</em></p>

<p>It might finally be time to witness the last chapter of the SEC’s lawsuit against distributed ledger tech company Ripple.</p>



<p>Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has hinted that the highly contested Hinman materials could tip the longstanding procedural fight with the Commission in his company’s favour. Garlinghouse implied there are critical insights to be deduced from the incoming reveal of the so-called Hinman documents.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-beginning-of-the-end"><strong>Beginning Of The End</strong></h2>



<p>Last month, a federal judge <a href="https://zycrypto.com/groundbreaking-ripple-win-in-xrp-case-looking-likely-as-court-rejects-secs-request-to-keep-hinman-docs-hidden/">ruled </a>that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission should release documents tied to former official William Hinman&#8217;s landmark 2018 ether speech to Ripple today, June 13. While Judge Torres will allow the SEC to redact the names and personal details of people mentioned in the emails and internal communications, she indicated that the SEC could not shield the so-called &#8220;Hinman Speech Documents,&#8221; explaining they were relevant to the judicial process.</p>



<p>While responding to a question put forth by cryptocurrency YouTuber Jungle Inc, Garlinghouse <a href="https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1668361426187218945">expressed</a> that while he could not disclose too much, he and Ripple&#8217;s chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty see the speech docs as worth the 18-month fight to get them made public.</p>



<p>America’s securities watchdog has hounded Ripple in court for years, having accused the company in December 2020 of selling XRP as an unregistered security.</p>



<p>Ripple requested the documents in discovery, and the request was granted on Oct. 21, 2022. While the documents could be used as a part of Ripple’s defense by providing key context on the SEC’s stance regarding crypto security classification, the agency had tried to keep them hidden on multiple occasions, contending that they are irrelevant to the court’s summary judgment decision.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Lawsuit Conclusion Draws Closer</strong></h2>



<p>Access to these now-controversial materials would mean Ripple counsel can finally understand how Hinman came to the conclusion that ether was not a security, which could impact XRP’s own categorization as a security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most Ripple fans believe the imminent unsealing is super bullish for XRP as they price Ripple’s groundbreaking victory in the lawsuit. Should Ripple score an outright win against the SEC, it would mean the agency would have to acknowledge that XRP is in fact not a security.</p>
