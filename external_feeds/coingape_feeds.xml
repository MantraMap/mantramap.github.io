As per the latest report from ABC News, SBF who&#8217;s currently in the Fox Hill jail of The Bahamas has agreed to his extradition to the US on multiple charges.

As per the latest report from ABC News, SBF who&#8217;s currently in the Fox Hill jail of The Bahamas has agreed to his extradition to the US on multiple charges.</p>
<p>Reports suggest that SBF has signed his extradition paper and a hearing for the same will happen on Wednesday in Nassau. The <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-12-21/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-signs-extradition-papers/101796332" target="_blank" rel="noopener">development</a> has been confirmed by Bahamas Acting Commissioner of Corrections Doan Cleare.</p>
<p>After signing his surrender documents on Tuesday, the Bahamas Commissioner said that SBF will sign a separate set of papers and finalize his waiver of rights to fight extradition.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Federal authorities are looking to fly back SBF to the U.S. soon after Wednesday&#8217;s hearing. The Bloomberg <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/sam-bankman-fried-to-fly-to-us-wednesday-escorted-by-fbi-agents-1.1861932" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> notes that the disgraced FTX founder will be accompanied to the US by FBI agents in a non-commercial aircraft. Another source familiar with the matter said that the plane will leave from a private airport in The Bahamas.</p>
<h3>Not A Good Christmas for SBF</h3>
<p>Sam Bankman Fried has been facing severe charges over the misuse of customers&#8217; funds at FTX which led to a dramatic collapse of a $32 billion company. Some previous <a href="https://coingape.com/how-much-jail-time-sbf-is-looking-at-if-convicted/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> suggest that SBF might face 115 years of prison which is equivalent to life imprisonment.</p>
<p>After getting earlier this month, the Bahamian court also denied bail to SBF last week. Since then, he&#8217;s been placed in one of the most notorious jail facilities of the island nation i.e. Fox Hill.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Bahamian authorities will escort Sam Bankman-Fried from the prison to the court. Although initially hesitant, SBF has agreed to the extradition to the U.S. This change in attitude might be partly due to the expectation that SBF could get bail in the US. So far, it isn&#8217;t clear where SBF is planning to land on Wednesday.</p>

This facility is now available to 160 countries across the world.</p>
<p>Currently, Uniswap supports Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum. It means over the DEX, users can purchase their respective cryptocurrencies such as DAI, ETH, MATIC, USDC, USDT, WBTC and WETH.</p>
<p>Amid the recent collapse of crypto exchange FTX, trust from <a href="https://coingape.com/uniswap-unveils-new-feature-to-rival-crypto-exchanges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">centralized exchanges</a> has dropped as many investors are moving their crypto into self-custody. As a result, the demand and trading volumes on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have also shot up.</p>
<p>DEX&#8217;s offers greater user protection since they have self-custodial wallets, and are permissionless and immutable protocols. But when compared to centralized exchanges, DEXs don&#8217;t offer a very sound onboarding experience. With the latest move, the Uniswap DEX is planning to solve this exactly.</p>
<h3>Uniswap Partners With MoonPay</h3>
<p>In partnership with MoonPay, Uniswap will now allow users to transact in DeFi via the Uniswap Web App and buy crypto using any card and bank transfers. Users just need to connect their wallet to the Uniswap Web app and can buy crypto instantly. The DEX platform <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://uniswap.org/blog/web-fiat-on-ramp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We&#8217;re bringing you the best fiat on-ramp experience &#8211; no spread fees on USDC, the lowest processing fees in the market, and instant access!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Uniswap has also made it clear that they would not collect any financial information of their users such as credit card, debit card, and bank information. Besides, they also don&#8217;t collect any personally identifiable information for their users. Uniswap has also placed minimum and maximum caps for the purchase of different crypto and stablecoins.</p>
<p>After the purchase, users can see their digital assets in their wallets within minutes. So far, the off-ramp facility of moving crypto to a bank account isn&#8217;t available. But the DEX added that they are working on it.</p>
<p>Also, users cannot purchase NFTs directly using cards or bank accounts. They first need to purchase ETH and buy NFTs through it.</p>

Earlier, reports suggested that the billionaire was already in the hunt for his replacement. It may be recalled that Musk had fired former CEO Parag Aggarwal among others as his first official act since taking over as the company head. It remains to be seen how his favorite cryptocurrency <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/dogecoin/">Dogecoin (DOGE)</a> will perform if someone replaces Musk.</p>

<h2>Software And Servers</h2>
<p>In a reaction to the Twitter poll on his leadership, Musk said he will still have some oversight on the company even if someone takes charge as new CEO. In line with his aggressive approach in leading the social media company, Musk said he would like to lead the software and servers teams. This is regardless of if he continues to be the CEO or not. Also, it will be interesting to see how soon would Musk be able to find his replacement. It may be recalled that he said his role as Twitter CEO would be temporary.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job! After that, I will just run the software &amp; servers teams.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Solana price prediction: a bearish breakdown of the month-long range setup puts Solana&#8217;s price in a longer correction. Thus, losing the $12.75 support may intensify the ongoing selling pressure and push the prices back to the last swing low of $11.35.

Thus, losing the $12.75 support may intensify the ongoing selling pressure and push the prices back to the last swing low of $11.35. But will this support replenish the bullish momentum or encourage prolonged downfall?</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $12.75 breakdown sets Solana coin price for a 7.5% downfall.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An evident bullish divergence in the daily-RSI slope indicates a potential bullish reversal from $11.35</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 24-hour trading volume in the Solana coin is $192 Million, indicating a 0.3% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/d/DaNmqCfB.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For nearly a month, the Solana price wobbled in a fixed range from $15 to $12.75. This long consolidation was supposed to bolster the coin price for higher recovery once it breached the overhead resistance of $15.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the recent sell-off in the crypto market triggered by <a href="https://coingape.com/massive-bnb-selling-amid-binance-fud-where-is-it-heading/">FUD surrounding Binance</a> and hearsay for US Fed to tighten interest rate hikes caused significant outflow in Solana coin. As a result, the coin price ended the range setup in the seller&#8217;s favor with a breakdown of $12.75 support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On December 16th, the Solana price breached the $12.75 support with increasing volume, indicating the sellers are aiming to visit lower levels. However, with the ongoing uncertainty in the crypto market, this altcoin is stuck in a retest phase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the SOL price trades at $12.25 with an intraday gain of 2.35% Furthermore, the higher price rejection candle attached to this daily candle indicates the intense selling pressure from above.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If this selling pressure persists, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoin</a> should eventually drop 7.5% lower to pierce the $11.35 support. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, if the recent selling pressure was solely due to panic selling in the market, the Solana price should rebound from the $11.35 mark.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Relative strength index:</strong> Despite the sideways price action, the higher high movement in the daily <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> indicates growth in underlying bullishness and a higher possibility for price reversal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMA&#8217;s:</strong> the large gap between the crucial EMAs(20, 50, 100, and 200) indicates the overall trend is bearish.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $12.7 and $15</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support levels- $11.35 and $10</span></li>

The genesis blockchain was then split in two, Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, similar to how <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> split into Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash back in 2017.</p>
<h2>What Sets ETC Apart</h2>
<p>Ethereum Classic describes itself as an open-source, blockchain-based distributed computing platform featuring smart contract functionality.</p>
<p>The fundamental functioning of Ethereum (ETH) and <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://br.coingape.com/tag/ethereum-classic/">Ethereum Classic (ETC)</a> is quite similar. On Ethereum Classic, the majority of Ethereum&#8217;s key functionalities are also available. However, there are a few significant distinctions between the two. The most crucial being the fact that, upgrades to the Ethereum <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/">blockchain</a> are predominantly incompatible with Ethereum Classic.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-expert-predicts-ethereum-eth-price-range-time-to-buy/">Crypto Expert Predicts Ethereum (ETH) Price; Time To Buy?</a></em></p>
<p>This became particularly notable in September 2022, when<a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/ethereum-merge/"> The Merge</a> took place, where the Ethereum blockchain finished transitioning to a proof-of-stake consensus method. As, Ethereum Classic still remained a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/proof-of-work-pow/">proof-of-work chain</a>.</p>
<p>At the start of last year, when the bull run was ready to commence, the token took off and rallied along with other major cryptocurrencies. And, despite having reached record highs, ETC&#8217;s price recently had a significant fall as a result of recent pullbacks and ongoing turmoil in the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/cryptocurrency-market/">crypto market</a>.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Classic (ETC) Price Prediction For Long Term</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, the price of ETC is $15.77, up by 1% over the previous day, according to the market monitoring portal <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">CoinMarketCap</a>. The price of the cryptocurrency was almost double the last year with ETC trading at around $34 in December of 2021.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132375" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/21002903/Capture10.png" alt="" width="918" height="539" /></p>
<p>But according to projections made by the website <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://cryptopredictions.com/ethereum-classic/">cryptopredictions.com</a>, the price of ETC might increase again in the coming years.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: </strong><a title="Solana (SOL) Price: Biggest Hurdle For Recovery Amid FTX Effect" href="https://coingape.com/solana-sol-price-biggest-hurdle-for-recovery-amid-ftx-effect/" rel="bookmark">Solana (SOL) Price: Biggest Hurdle For Recovery</a></em></p>
<p>The data further predicts a steady growth rate for the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> in case there are no more black-swan events.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132374" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/21002813/image4.png" alt="" width="1579" height="903" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, according to today’s price, if you invested $1,000 into Ethereum Classic, you would receive 63.33 ETC coins.</p>
<p>And in case the price hits $100 in the next few years, this $1,000 investment of yours would become $6,333, which is an increase of 533%.</p>

However, XRP Holders’ lawyer has claimed that the SEC is filing cases against crypto firms as it wants to kill the market.</p>
<h2>XRP lawyer slams watchdogs approach</h2>
<p>Gabriel Shapiro, General Counsel at Delphi Labs mentioned that SEC is aggressively expanding <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1605231668012408833" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">the notion of &#8220;disgorgement&#8221;</a> in the <a href="https://coingape.com/lbry-faces-defeat-in-sec-vs-lbry-case-tweets-wont-give-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawsuit against LBRY</a>. It is trying to treat all distributions of LBC tokens as sales.</p>
<p>It added that the SEC is equating the resulting benefits of distribution to profit generated on the current LBC spot price.</p>
<p>John Deaton, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/amicus-curiae/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amicus Curiae</a> in the XRP lawsuit or XRP holders’ lawyer slammed the SEC over its approach towards the crypto market. He highlighted the commission&#8217;s alleged in its objection that all money raised by the crypto firms went into operation.</p>
<h2>SEC making abrupt claims</h2>
<p>Deaton added that after these claims the SEC brings up disgorgement. As per the XRP lawyer, under Liu, it is meant to be offset by legitimate business expenses. However, the watchdog pled that everything raised by the LBRY went into operations.</p>
<p>XRP lawyer is being abusive in the non-fraud case against LBRY. He mentioned this directly reflecting the SEC’s approach to crypto which is to kill it. Deaton brought up the SEC vs KiK summary judgment the commission wasn’t able to get disgorgement.</p>
<p>He added that this is a dangerous message that SEC is sending to the crypto market in general.</p>

Previously this support has initiated some strong rallies, validating it as a high accumulation zone.  Thus, the coin price is currently hovering above this support in order to replenish lost bullish momentum.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The short-term trend in polygon coins is sideways.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The daily EMAs accumulated near the $0.87 mark create a tough hurdle to overcome.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the MATIC is $382.5 Million, indicating a 33% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/v/vvIdPYEO.png" alt="Polygon Coin Price" width="1946" height="1109" />Source- &#8211;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the recent sell-off in the crypto market triggered by <a href="https://coingape.com/massive-bnb-selling-amid-binance-fud-where-is-it-heading/">FUD surrounding Binance</a> and the possible tightening of interest rate hikes by the US Fed, the polygon coin price witnessed significant outflow in last since last week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the top of $0.94, the altcoin is 18% down and evaporates the entire gains from the November end rally. By the press time, the coin currently trades at $0.79 and wavers above the multi-month support of $0.763.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the accumulation zone has well supported the polygon coin price over the past two months, maintaining an overall sideways trend. While the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/bitcoin-ethereum-price-prediction-is-this-a-temporary-recovery-in-crypto-market/">crypto market turned bullish today</a>, the MATIC price rebounded 2.71% higher from the mentioned support. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the buying pressure persists, a daily candle closing above the $0.82 resistance will increase the chances for a bullish reversal.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, considering the overall market sentiment is still negative, the Polygon coin price will likely breach the $0.763 support. This possible breakdown may hint at a deeper correction which could plummet the prices 13.5% down to the $0.69 mark.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicators</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs:</strong> the flattish EMAs(100 and 200) accentuate an overall range-bound movement. However, these EMAs offer additional selling pressure with a potential bearish crossover between the 50-and-100-day EMA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>RSI:</strong> the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">daily-RSI slope</a> dives below the last swing slow for the support level, indicating weakness in the bullish momentum and a higher possibility for downtrend resumption.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Polygon Coin Price Intraday Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $0.79</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Medium</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance levels- $0.82 and $0.87</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support levels- $0.76 and $0.6</span></li>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin (BTC) price rallied today after the U.S. Dollar Index fell sharply in response to the Bank of Japan&#8217;s raising their upper band limit for 10-year yields to 50 basis points. The BTC price rebounded after hitting a low of $16,398 on Monday and extended gains on Tuesday to hit almost $17,000.

The BTC price rebounded after hitting a low of $16,398 on Monday and extended gains on Tuesday to hit almost $17,000.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin price soars nearly 2% in the last 24 hours, with the price currently trading at $16,933. The 24-hour low and high for Bitcoin are $16,398 and $17,028. The resistance near $17,150 remains crucial for the BTC price. Bitcoin will be bullish in 2023 if the BTC monthly close breaks above the resistance level.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin On-Chain Data Indicates Selloff</h2>
<p>While the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bear-market-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bear market</a> rally supported by the weak U.S. dollar amid Bank of Japan monetary policy changes pushes Bitcoin price upwards, the upcoming rally will likely be weak.</p>
<p>On-chain data indicates short-term Bitcoin holders, especially 3-6 months, are selling their Bitcoin holdings continuously. In fact, the decline in BTC price observed on Monday was due to a selloff by 3-6 month Bitcoin holders.</p>
<figure id="attachment_132366" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132366" style="width: 714px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-132366" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/20212101/Bitcoin-Spent-Output-3-6-Months.webp" alt="Bitcoin Spent Output (3-6 Months)" width="714" height="354" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-132366" class="wp-caption-text">Bitcoin Spent Output (3-6 Months). Source: CryptoQuant</figcaption></figure>
<p>Historically, the Spent Output Age Bands rise for 3-6 months holders is followed by massive downward movements. In fact, a sharp move occurred just before the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a> crisis. Therefore, traders must keep an eye on the Spent Output of 3-6 month Bitcoin holders to help predict an upcoming Bitcoin price fall.</p>

<h2>Crypto Analysts&#8217; Bitcoin Predictions</h2>
<p>Crypto analyst <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-btc-price-close-to-this-level-for-next-support-range/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael van de Poppe predicts that BTC</a> could have a strong continuation if it breaks the $16,900 level. Moreover, Bitcoin holding the $16.5K support level remains key for the price rally toward $18K.</p>
<p>Rekt Capital earlier suggested that <a href="https://coingape.com/popular-analyst-predicts-bitcoin-btc-eth-ada-link-price-for-new-year-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin price holding the $17,150 level</a> will be crucial for Bitcoin and altcoins. If Bitcoin closed the month below the support level, a move toward $13,900 can be seen. Moreover, Bitcoin has strong resistance at $18K and a strong rally is possible only if BTC price breaks the $18K-$19K level.</p>

The blockchain lost value quite rapidly with the news of the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/sam-bankman-fried/">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>&#8216;s crypto empire facing liquidity issues. Although the cryptocurrency recovered significantly since then, there is still long way to recovery to the all time high level. Compared to the price range it maintained in first week of November 2022, the SOL token is still under 50% of the value.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, crypto analysts are predicting that Solana (SOL) price could potentially never return to the all time high of $258. In July 2021, at the peak of the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bull-market/">bull run</a>, the cryptocurrency had a total market size of $78.20 billion. Whereas the current market size is $4.60 billion. The recent bloodbath came due to the stake the SBF related companies had in the blockchain network. The links to FTX collapse had a huge effect on the SOL price.</p>
<h2>Threats To Solana Network</h2>
<p>Despite the underlying contagion effects, crypto analysts say it could be difficult for SOL to recover to the all time high. Jordi Alexander, a crypto market insider, predicted that Solana&#8217;s fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $100 billion was not justified.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Solana never comes close to its ATH again. The main threat to Solana is a new L1 that also uses the same approach but does it in a better designed way. There is quite a strong community, the builders love it.. But I don&#8217;t think that can explain the $100b FDV that it had.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

Thus, from the top of the $0.11 resistance, the price has tumbled 35.4% down to reach its current price of $0.074. The memecoin breached multiple supports during this downfall and most recently plunged below the $0.074 level. How far may this bearish breakdown tumble the Dogecoin?</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The  $0.074 support breakdown sets the Dogecoin price for a 12% drop</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The RSI indicator wavering low in the bearish territory indicates negative sentiment among market participants.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 24-hour trading volume in the Dogecoin coin is $467.5 Billion, indicating a 30% loss.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/n/NLjMmZBE.png" alt="Dogecoin Price" width="1946" height="1109" />Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On December 19th, the coin price witnessed a nearly 10% intraday loss and pierced monthly support of $0.074. Moreover, a recent Twitter poll on whether Elon Musk should step down from Twitter&#8217;s head must be attributed to this aggressive downfall. Among 17,502,391 votes, 57.5% of the people chose ‘YES’ that Musk shows step down, while 42.5% voters said ‘NO.’</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Should I step down as head of Twitter? I will abide by the results of this poll.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, a high possibility of Dogecoin-support Elon passing the baton for Twitter head to someone else must have created more negative in the market.</span></p>
<p>Also read <a href="https://coingape.com/elon-musk-actively-searching-for-new-twitter-ceo/">Breaking: Elon Musk Actively Searching For New Twitter CEO</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, the famous American rapper Snoop Dogg posted a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/SnoopDogg/status/1604656918844256257?s=20&amp;t=_twRJ5EmNFKK01VXAtag6Q" rel="nofollow">similar tweet</a> saying whether he should run Twitter, and out of a total of 3,398,119 votes, 81% of people said ‘YES.’ However, this tweet is mostly like a joke that just needs to be laughed out.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back to analysis, today, the Dogecoin price is 3%, and retest the breached $0.074 mark as a potential resistance. The long-wick rejection attached to this daily indicates the sellers are defending the newly obtained barrier.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the post-retest downfall may tumble the coin price another 10% down to revisit the $0.065 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, a daily candle closing above $0.074 may weaken the bearish thesis.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical  indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>MACD:</strong> A significant spread between the indicator’s <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a> and signal indicates sustained selling in the market, which eases further correction in Doge price</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs:</strong> the EMA slope offers two bear signals, with the negative crossover between the 20-and-200-day EMA and a potential death crossover between the 50-and-200-day EMA.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dogecoin Price Intraday Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $0.734</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Medium </span></li>

This comes after Musk posted a Twitter poll on Sunday afternoon, asking people if they thought he should continue leading the firm or resign from his position.</p>
<h2>Elon Abides By Twitter Verdict</h2>
<p>With over 17 million people casting their votes in the viral Twitter poll, the end results came in with a whopping 57.6% of voters agreeing that Musk should resign.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Should I step down as head of Twitter? I will abide by the results of this poll.</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1604617643973124097?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 18, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Musk, who bought the company in October of this year for a jaw-dropping $44 billion, has previously declared that his role as CEO would be temporary. Musk had stated, &#8220;I expect to reduce my time at Twitter and find somebody else to run Twitter over time.&#8221; in a court in November.</p>
<h2>Hunt For CEO Had Already Started</h2>
<p>However, Musk later said in a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1604628761395138561" rel="nofollow">tweet</a> that he found no potential successor at the social media giant.</p>
<p>The 51-years-old billionaire businessman was further quoted as saying,</p>
<blockquote><p>The question is not finding a CEO, the question is finding a CEO who can keep Twitter alive</p></blockquote>
<p>Although, many have raised questions about the legitimacy of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/twitter/">Twitter</a> polls which are often plagued with malicious bots and unauthentic accounts casting multiple shares of votes, Elon seems to be headfast on finding a new CEO.</p>
<p>Reports have also emerged that, Elon and his team were already on the hunt for a new CEO, even before the Twitter poll was posted.</p>
<h2>Elon Musk&#8217;s Rocky Start At Twitter</h2>
<p>Musk&#8217;s takeover of Twitter has been tumultuous; under his direction, there have been significant <a href="https://coingape.com/whats-going-on-at-twitter-layoffs-twitter-outage-doge-down/">employee layoffs</a>, an alleged increase in <a href="https://coingape.com/elon-musk-deletes-kanye-wests-twitter-account-heres-why/">racist hate speech</a>, <a href="https://coingape.com/gm-pauses-twitter-advertising-others-boycott-musk/">advertisers boycotting Twitter</a> or trimming down their ad budgets significantly, and also the infamous gamble of reinstating previously banned accounts.</p>

<p>And even more recently, women who lost their jobs at Twitter are suing billionaire Elon Musk in federal court alleging that the mass layoffs specifically targeted female employees.</p>
<p>Carolina Bernal Strifling and Willow Wren Turkal, both of whom had previously worked for the social media giant, brought the class action lawsuit on behalf of other female employees who were in a comparable position.</p>

This also led to steady growth in the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/polygon-matic/">Polygon (MATIC)</a> price, so much so that it is now one of the favorite cryptocurrencies of popular faces in the industry. The token really picked up at the beginning of last year, when the bull run was just about starting. Although it rose manifold at all time highs, the recent pullbacks due to crypto crash incidents led to huge price correction for MATIC.</p>

<h2>Polygon (MATIC) Price Prediction For Long Term</h2>
<p>As of writing, MATIC price stands at $0.8021, up 1.27% in the last 24 hours, according to price tracking platform <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polygon/" rel="nofollow">CoinMarketCap</a>. At the peak of last year&#8217;s bull run, the cryptocurrency shot up to about six times its current value. Almost an year ago in December 2021, MATIC price was $2.72. Meanwhile, it is estimated that the top 10 ranked cryptocurrency could reach as much as $1.710 in a few years time, as per the estimates of <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://cryptopredictions.com/polygon/?year=2023" rel="nofollow">cryptopredictions.com</a>.</p>
<p>However, the website also estimates that the cryptocurrency could take a huge price jump going into 2023.</p>

<p>The Polygon network also has few the metrics going its way currently. Recently, with the launch of former U.S. President Donald Trump’s NFT Trading Cards, Polygon NFT market saw increased traction. Also, the company tied up with major companies like Reddit platform, increasing scope for further expansion. The Polygon blockchain saw huge volumes of NFT trading volumes, raising speculation of MATIC price rise.</p>

He is currently facing charges in Manhattan federal court for eight counts of fraud. But things went haywire when SBF demanded to see a copy of his federal indictment before agreeing to return to the U.S. Due to the denial of such a request, Bankman-Fried was consequently sent back to the Fox Hill Prison in Nassau.</p>
<h2>Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s Bail Plea</h2>
<p>However, as per the latest reports the former <a href="https://coingape.com/sbf-resigns-john-ray-iii-joins-as-new-ftx-ceo/">FTX CEO</a> might finally be released on bail in the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/united-states/">United States</a>. And, according to FOX business journalist, <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/EleanorTerrett" rel="nofollow">Eleanor Terrett</a>, SBF might step on the U.S. soil by &#8220;tonight or tomorrow&#8221;.</p>

<p>She continued by saying that thee bail could be granted to Bankman-Fried after preliminary agreements between his attorneys and Southern District of New York (SDNY) prosecutors.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Adding detail here: Bankman-Fried will be arraigned at a federal court in Manhattan where he’ll have a new bail hearing. While multiple sources say he’s expected to be released on bail, it will ultimately be up to the judge to decide.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The development comes moments after <a href="https://coingape.com/the-bahamas-judge-denies-bail-to-disgraced-ftx-founder/">Bankman-Fried’s bail request got denied</a> in the Bahamas court. Since SBF was detained on December 13 on suspicion of fraud and money laundering, his attorneys have stepped up efforts to secure his release on bail.</p>
<h2>Higher Chances Of Bail In US?</h2>
<p>Sources who are closely related to this matter have stated that, SBF has a higher chance of getting bail in the United States after his request is put up in the Manhattan court.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href="https://coingape.com/manhattan-court-finds-ftx-founder-sbf-guilty-to-wire-fraud/">Manhattan Court Finds FTX Founder SBF Guilty To Wire Fraud</a></em></p>
<p>Accordingly, defense attorney Zachary Margulis-Ohnuma noted that SBF will be asked to submit a plea during his initial court appearance in Manhattan and the judge will then determine his bail.</p>

However,<a href="https://coingape.com/shiba-inu-coin-news-1-3-trillion-shib-moved-amid-this-binance-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> recent updates from the SHIB</a> ecosystem have kept SHIBarmy morales high amid the recent crypto downturn.</p>
<h2>Whale behind Shiba Inu coin price drop?</h2>
<p>As per the LookonChain, a whale address moved around 200 billion Shiba Inu coin (approx worth $1.67 million) to Crypto.com on Monday. However, just after 5 hours of this mega transfer, <a href="https://coingape.com/shiba-inu-coin-shib-tokens-price-skyrockets-over-this-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shiba Inu price</a> dropped by big 7%.</p>
<p><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1605078805831303169" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Data depicts</a> that Shiba Inu coin whales a good amount of money over this transaction. Tracker reported that the crypto whale bought around 15.29 Trillion SHIB tokens with 10 Ethereum (approx worth $3,795). This whale acquisition was recorded on August 7, 2020.</p>
<p>It added that the whale then made 1967 Ethereum (approx worth $7 million) by trading on SHIB on the Uniswap platform. The crypto whales went on trading Shiba Inu on Centralised exchanges after SHIB got listed on Binance, Crypto.com, and more.</p>
<p>LookonChain mentioned that the whale might have made a profit of more than $85 million. It highlighted that if the whale buys the Shiba Inu coin when it received the tokens and went to sell at the price when transferring out the same out amount of tokens.</p>
<h2>Will SHIB price drop more ahead?</h2>
<p>However, the whale is reportedly an expert in buying Shiba Inu at a lower price and selling them at a price surge. Meanwhile, the Crypto whale is still holding 3.33 trillion Shiba Inu Coin (approx worth $28 million).</p>
<p>On the market side, Shiba Inu price is down by 11% in the last 7 days. SHIB is trading at an average price of $0.000008, at the press time. Meanwhile, its 24 hour trading volume is up by 52% to stand at $196.7 million. However, Shiba Inu Coin is still the second largest meme token with a market cap of around $4.7 billion.</p>

Knowing when to buy and sell is the most important aspect of NFT trading. There are a few different strategies that can be used in NFT trading, but the most common and easiest to follow is the buy low, sell high strategy.</p>
<p>You buy NFTs when the price is low and sell them when the price is high using this strategy, which is exactly what it sounds like. Although this tactic is straightforward, it can be challenging to put into practice. You need to have a solid understanding of the <a href="https://coingape.com/nft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFT market</a> and the NFTs you&#8217;re trading in order to successfully buy low and sell high.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What is NFT?</b></p>
<p>An NFT is a digital asset that represents physical items such as art, music, in-game items, and videos. They are bought and sold online, frequently with <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cryptocurrency</a>, and they are generally encoded with the same underlying software as many cryptos.</p>
<p>Although they&#8217;ve been around since 2014, NFTs are gaining notoriety now because they are becoming an increasingly popular way to buy and sell digital artwork. A staggering $174 million has been spent on NFTs since November 2017. NFTs are also typically one-of-a-kind, or at the very least one of a very limited run, with unique identifying codes.</p>
<h3><b>Factors for Evaluating NFT Collectibles</b></h3>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Purpose of the NFT</li>
<li aria-level="1">The rarity of the NFT</li>
<li aria-level="1">Utility of the NFT</li>
<li aria-level="1">Tokenomics of the NFT</li>
<li aria-level="1">Artist or Creator of the NFT</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Top 5 NFT trading Strategies For Investors 2023</b></h2>
<h3><b>Buy the floor</b></h3>
<p>There is a good chance that NFTs will continue to exist for many more years as the market for them continues to grow in popularity. Because of this, new investors ought to think about buying NFTs at the floor price.</p>
<p>The least expensive price for a non-fungible token is the NFT market floor price. The lowest NFT listed for sale, which would be the floor price, can be found by sorting the NFT items from a particular collection by price. However, not all inexpensive NFTs assure a profit. You should always choose an NFT project based on your interests because of this. The best thing you could do is follow the project before it is launched to ensure you&#8217;ll get the best price for an NFT collectible. Purchasing it at the floor price is always a wise NFT trading strategy in case the token gains popularity.</p>
<h3><b>Search for Google Trends</b></h3>
<p>Regardless of how inexperienced you are in the NFT market, you can quickly tell if a specific NFT market is still hot by checking the most recent Google trend. This will resemble marketing research more. But the reason for that is simple: that&#8217;s what it is. And what better place to ask this question than the search engine that everyone uses to browse the web? A great free resource that provides excellent insights into the general public&#8217;s perception of a topic or keyword is Google Trends. Ratings for word searches range from 0 to 100. A high rating suggests that NFT collectibles are appealing to consumers. It also suggests that now is a good time to buy subtly.</p>
<p>Try to track and compare market trends with the project&#8217;s trading volume for better outcomes. A project with many traders is more likely to be healthy than one with a small number of traders, so it is also crucial to keep track of this number.</p>
<h3><b>Purchase NFTs collectibles from a few sellers</b></h3>
<p>Any NFT investment that yields a profit assumes that you will be able to sell it for more money than you paid for it. Naturally, it will be more challenging to sell an NFT without a sizable community that is willing to support the project.</p>
<p>The number of sellers for a given NFT collection should always influence your trading strategies. You need to have a significant enough trading volume to close a sale if you want to sell. The challenge of maintaining competitive prices grows as the number of sellers rises. This is so that more people than you will lower their prices.</p>
<h3><b>Look for underpriced NFTs</b></h3>
<p>Finding an underpriced NFT in a marketplace is the goal of every novice NFT investor. This approach works regardless of whether there is little interest in a particular NFT collection because it is independent of market trends. Finding NFTs that are currently selling for less than they were purchased for is necessary for this NFT trading strategy to be profitable.</p>
<p>Although market prices should be taken into account, they should not be your only consideration. You can assume that the NFT value has increased if the market for a project as a whole has improved.</p>
<p><b>Buy the ceiling</b></p>
<p>If you have the cash to invest in NFTs, which are valuable and in high demand, the ceiling, or top, is a great option. This implies that if there is greater demand for the project, ceiling NFTs may become more expensive. These products are also well-liked in the marketplace, where customers can sort products by price, from highest to lowest. They might be advertised as the best illustration of the project&#8217;s NFTs in various locations.</p>
<p>The disadvantage of this specific NFT trading strategy is that fewer people have enough money to buy NFT. Finding someone willing to sell at a fair price is difficult as a result. If the project loses support, ceiling traders could incur significant losses. This is a play with a high risk/high reward ratio for those with sizable bankrolls.</p>

As a result, a majority of cryptocurrencies are trading in the green today, creating a sense of <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/bitcoin-ethereum-price-prediction-technical-chart-hints-an-upcoming-relief-rally/">relief rally</a> in the market. But how far may this recovery last?</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Top Gainers and Losers</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-132341" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/20183258/Screenshot_20221220_182248.png" alt="heatmap of cryptocurrency prices" width="1200" height="675" />Source- Coin360 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On today’s bullish day, XDC Network and ImmutableX tokens are the biggest gainers among the top 100 list. As per coinmarkecap website, the XDC price shows a 5.79% rise in the last 24hour, hitting the current price of $0.026, whereas IMX jumps to $0.4544, registering a 5.35% rise. Conversely, Chain and MultiversX (Elrond) tokens show the highest loss, where XCD dumped 9.74% to trade, and EGLD price tumbled 8.54% to trade at $35.7.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin Price </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-132342" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/20183346/Screenshot_20221220_182358.png" alt="BTC" width="1200" height="358" />Source- Coinmarketcap</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On December 16th, the <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-btc-price-close-to-this-level-for-next-support-range/">Bitcoin price</a> gave a massive breakdown from the combined support of $16800 and a rising trendline. This breakdown poised BTC for a deeper correction phase if it shows sustainability below the $16800 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the coin price has been sideways for the last four days trying to replenish the bearish momentum at the newly obtained resistance of $16800. Today, the Bitcoin price is 2.3% up and shows a retest to the mentioned barrier,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/b/BVI6s3j2.png" alt="Bitcoin Price Prediction" width="1946" height="1109" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, if the selling pressure persists, the sellers will resume the prevailing and plunge the price below $16000 support into revisiting $16820.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, a daily candle closing below $16820 will weaken the bearish thesis.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum price </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-132343" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/20183412/Screenshot_20221220_182429.png" alt="ETH" width="1200" height="369" />Source- Coinmarketcap</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the recent downfall, the <a href="https://coingape.com/ethereum-price-prediction-why-eth-price-may-drop-another-9/">Ethereum price</a> managed to sustain above local support of $1160. Today, as the crypto market turned bullish for major cryptocurrencies, the ETH price rose 4% and reached the $1213 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, with sustained buying, this <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoin</a> will retest the recently breached support of $1240-1220. However, this relief rally backed by lesser volume indicates this growth is temporary, and the ETH price soon resumes the prior downfall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/t/tMV1CoAE.png" alt="Ethereum Price Prediction" width="1531" height="818" />Source-Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, with a high possibility for Ethereum price to start a fresh decline from the $1240-$1220 mark, the coin holders may witness an 11% downfall to reach $1080.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternatively, a breakout above $1240 will undermine the bearish momentum.</span></p>

<p style="color: #252525">With portfolios going red, it&#8217;s understandable that investors want to tread sensibly in the current market scenario. Hence, we have compiled a list of altcoins, that look most stable and low risk, and could hold your portfolio together in the ongoing bear market.</p>
<h3 style="color: #252525">Ethereum (ETH)</h3>
<p style="color: #252525">Ethereum is usually criticised for having high gas fees for conducting transactions. However, with its recent pivot to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism and scheduled ecosystem upgrades that will make the network more scalable, more secure, and more sustainable, Ethereum is here to stay.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">It would be virtually impossible to think about the NFT and dApp ecosystem without Ethereum. With so much usability and significance, Ethereum will remain a force in the industry despite a bear market.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Current Price: $1,212.54<br style="color: #252525" />Market Cap: $148 Billion</p>
<h3 style="color: #252525">BNB</h3>
<p style="color: #252525">Although BNB is a utility token and has been regularly criticised for being too &#8220;centralized,&#8221;  it has captured a significant market share in the crypto industry.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">One can not underestimate the rise of Binance&#8217;s ecosystem and the subsequent importance of BNB (to pay for goods and services, settle transaction fees on Binance Smart Chain, participate in exclusive token sales, etc.).</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Current Price: $249.35<br style="color: #252525" />Market Cap: $39 Billion</p>

<h3 style="color: #252525">XRP</h3>
<p style="color: #252525">Ripple (along with two of its top executives) is embroiled in a court case with the SEC, with the latter alleging that they should have registered XRP as a security, while the company maintains that XRP is a currency.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Regardless of the legal battle, XRP is still prominent as the ecosystem seeks to replace the old, expensive, and cumbersome international payments system. It can aide traditional financial institutions in modernising their infrastructure to enable fast and cost-effective payment processing.</p>

However, <a href="https://coingape.com/terra-classic-lunc-developers-edward-kim-zaradar-leave-terra-rebels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">core developers Edward Kim and Tobias Anderson</a> (Zaradar) leaving Terra Rebels sparked fear in the Terra Classic community.</p>
<p>As a result, Terra Classic (LUNC) price slips below $0.00013, the lowest level seen last time in August. The 24-hour low and high for LUNC are $0.0001288 and $0.0001402, respectively.</p>
<h2>Zaradar To Work With Edward Kim in New Team</h2>
<p>Terra Classic core developer Tobias Anderson or Zaradar renounced his position due to an inability to align with the most recent governance discussions on funding. The fear spurred in the LUNC community if Edward Kim and Zaradar will be associated with Terra Classic.</p>
<p>Zaradar in a recent <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/ZaradarBH/status/1605067328198086658" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweet</a> on December 20 clarifies that he&#8217;s not leaving the community and continue to be in the Terra Classic community. He plans to work on L1 developments on the chain and focus on building.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Just to clarify. I am not leaving the community, I am simply trying to focus the time I have on L1 and let TR grow onto a path of its own. Lets all just look forward and focus on building, rather the battling.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The community member asked Zaradar whether he believes Terra Rebels is headed in the wrong direction. Zaradar commented &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The dispute in Terra Rebels started weeks ago, he said.</p>
<p>LUNC influencer ClassyCrypto <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/ClassyCrypto_/status/1605032144518406144" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Zaradar <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">left </span><span class="r-18u37iz">Terra Rebels </span>to work with Terra Classic core developer Edward Kim <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">on a new </span><span class="r-18u37iz">LUNC</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> development team. However, Edward Kim hasn&#8217;t cleared that if he is working on a different team or planning to work on an existing developer group.</span></p>
<p><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/ClassyCrypto_/status/1604995726861225984" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terra Classic v23 upgrade</a> has already been delivered, said Terra Rebels. The v23 release started with the <a href="https://coingape.com/terra-classic-edward-kim-on-reopening-ibc-channel-proposal-10983-other-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">v1.0.4 release to open IBC channels</a>. Currently, Terra Rebels is working with Edward Kim for v2.0.3 LUNC parity.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, TerraCVita developer group is ready to work with Edward Kim and build for the community.</p>
<h2>Terra Classic (LUNC) Price Tumbles Amid FUD</h2>
<p>Terra Classic price tumbles to a low of $0.0001288 as the community speculates a massive fall in LUNC price after core developers quit Terra Rebels. Currently, the LUNC price trades at $0.0001343, down 4% in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>The trading volume recorded a 78% increase amid the bear market rally in the broader crypto market. However, experts believe the LUNC price can dump below $0.00012 as <a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-market-update-japan-monetary-policy-bitcoin-ethereum-price/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin and Ethereum rally remains weak</a>.</p>

<p>The top crypto losers on Tuesday were Terra Classic (LUNC), Chian (XCN), and Toncoin (TON).</p>
<h2>Top Crypto Losers today, December 20:</h2>

<h5>Popular meme coins:</h5>
<h3>Dogecoin and Shiba Inu price:</h3>
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) fell 4.03% at USD$0.074332. Its 24-hour trading volume was up almost 132% at $671,395,814. <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/shiba-inu-shib/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shiba Inu</a> (SHIB) was down 3.42% to USD$0.000008. At the time of writing, the current CoinMarketCap ranking of Shiba Inu is 15, at a live market cap of USD$4,612,555,936.</p>
<h3>Short-term relief in Bitcoin (BTC) prices:</h3>
<p>The slight recovery in Bitcoin&#8217;s price today from an overnight dip on December 20 was seen as the U.S. dollar weakened following a sudden policy twist from the Bank of Japan (BoJ).</p>
<p>As soon as the Japanese policymakers lifted the cap on bond yields, the yen instantly gained against the U.S. dollar. As of 6:59 a.m. EST, the U.S. dollar index (DXY) was down 0.74%, retreating to lows under 104 and abandoning its attempt at a sustained rally on intraday timeframes.<br />
The short-term benefits from today&#8217;s fall in DXY figures have brought relief to Bitcoin enthusiasts today.</p>
