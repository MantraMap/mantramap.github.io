			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Australia's Treasury Department is developing its token mapping framework for digital assets to be both "tech agnostic" and "principles-based," rather than adopting a rigid, "token specific" methodology. This innovative approach aims to flexibly classify tokens based on their function and purpose.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Trevor Power, the Australian Treasury assistant secretary, shared in an interview with Cointelegraph during the Australian Blockchain Week that the purpose of this approach is to structure regulations around the principles of the token's function, rather than focusing solely on the specific technology or token.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"The token mapping paper spends a lot of time talking about the token, the system, the value delivered for the very purpose of trying to structure whatever regulation such that it draws on those principles so then a token can be placed within that," Power stated. </p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">He further emphasized the intent behind the approach, stating: "It's trying to be tech agnostic. It's not trying to be token specific."</p>
Shaping the Framework
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Power outlined that crypto assets, which change their utility and function over time, would be subject to regulatory review, particularly if they become significant within the ecosystem. This review will ensure that they "graduate through the regulatory system" accordingly, despite previous delays.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">He stressed the importance of creating a robust token mapping regulation that could function in a "tech-neutral" and "principles-based manner," to adequately account for such changes.</p>
Influence and Reception
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Power highlighted that the token mapping initiative hadn't been influenced by recent regulatory enforcement actions by the United States Securities Exchange Commission. Instead, he hinted that Australia's crypto framework might lean closer to the European Union's Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation in its approach.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">As Australia's token mapping framework takes shape, Power welcomed U.S. and foreign digital asset firms to consider the Australian market, asserting that they should align with the token mapping framework, designed to balance innovation and consumer protection:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"There are two arms to every component of regulation. One is to make sure that that framework is there, and the second one is to make sure there's room for industry to grow and be innovative."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Australia's Treasury Department believes that token mapping is essential to understanding how the crypto ecosystem interacts with the country's existing financial regulatory frameworks. They had earlier conducted a consultation process, inviting stakeholders' views on the proposed token mapping framework.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">NEAR Foundation, the firm behind the NEAR protocol ecosystem development, is partnering with Alibaba Cloud, Alibaba Group's digital technology and intelligence backbone.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The strategic alliance aims to galvanize the NEAR Foundation's reach into Alibaba Cloud's extensive developer ecosystem in Asia and the Middle East. By simplifying the process of launching new NEAR validators via Alibaba Cloud's "plug-and-play" infrastructure, the partnership seeks to attract more developers to build on the NEAR protocol.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">&ldquo;Our partnership with Alibaba Cloud is a major milestone for the NEAR Foundation. It proves that NEAR protocol&rsquo;s technology can truly lift the restrictions surrounding Web3 development, allowing more creators to build exciting applications and helping to onboard billions of Web2 users to the possibility of Web3," said Marieke Flament, CEO of the NEAR Foundation.</p>

Tooling and Infrastructure: Empowering Developers
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The NEAR Foundation and Alibaba Cloud are joining forces to offer Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) as a service to developers and users in the NEAR ecosystem. This service, coupled with multi-chain data indexing, provides developers with a data-query API, simplifying the process of searching data across multiple blockchains.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">App developers working on the NEAR Blockchain Operating System (BOS) can now leverage Alibaba Cloud's infrastructure. BOS offers a unified layer for browsing and discovering open web experiences compatible with any blockchain. Its standout feature, FastAuth, enables developers to onboard new users with just an email, eliminating the need for crypto.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">&ldquo;Together with NEAR&rsquo;s Node-as-a-Service initiative and BOS, we support the Web3 community to create exciting applications that will benefit a wide consumer audience. We are looking forward to what we can achieve with this partnership," said Raymond Xiao, Head of International Web3 Solutions, Alibaba Cloud Intelligence.</p>

Market Response and Future Collaborations
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Following the partnership announcement, NEAR's market price witnessed an 8% surge to $1.57, signaling the market's positive response. As part of the partnership's future endeavors, both entities plan to expand their collaboration through participation in a variety of global Web3 conferences and events.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The announcement follows closely on the heels of Alibaba's appointment of new Chairman Joseph Tsai, known for his active investments in the Web3 sector.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Bounces Off 29985:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 27 June 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) continued to steadily soften early in the Asian session as the pair hovered around the 30266.94 area, a level that represents the 61.8% retracement of the recent appreciating range from 29539.57 to 31443.67.&nbsp;&nbsp; Buying pressure recently emerged around the 29975.80 area when BTC/USD tested the 78.6% retracement of the same appreciating range.&nbsp; &nbsp;The depreciation to this area accelerated after Stops were elected below the 30198.14 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the appreciating range from 24750 to 31443.67.&nbsp; The recent rapid appreciation to the 31443.67 area was its strongest level in twelve months and represented a test of the 31488.23 area, an upside price objective associated with buying pressure that strengthened around the 26637.41 area.&nbsp; &nbsp;Stops were also recently elected above the 30127.80 area during the ongoing appreciation, an upside price objective associated with historical buying pressure that emerged around the 15460 and 19568.52 areas.&nbsp; Stops were also triggered above additional upside price objectives around the 29068, 29159, 29458, 30088, 30200, 30292, and 30477 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additional upside price objectives include the 31737, 32125, and 33569 areas.&nbsp; Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 31674, 32043, 34531, and 34658 areas.&nbsp; Following recent upside price activity, areas of technical support and potential buying pressure include the 30192, 29863, 29423, 28886, 28179, 28096, and 27293 areas.&nbsp; Technicians are closely watching to see how much technical support develops around the 28095.44 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the historical depreciating range from 69000 to 15460.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">The world&rsquo;s top cryptocurrency exchange is eyeing a move to Dubai, in the midst of its battle with the United States&rsquo; Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Binance Dubai General Manager Alex Chehade has said that the UAE is the prime destination for crypto businesses and has noted its pro-crypto stance and policies.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Chehade notes that the UAE is diversifying away from fossil fuels and has turned to cryptocurrency to achieve this. He also expects the influx of young people to the country to contribute to the rapid adoption of cryptocurrency. In a tweet last June 15, Binance MENA retweeted that over 27.7% of the UAE&rsquo;s population are crypto owners.</p>
Virtual Assets and Financial Diversity
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The UAE has its own regulator exclusively for virtual assets, the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA). Just last June 15, top crypto exchange OKX received an MVP preparatory license from VARA. MVP stands for &lsquo;minimal viable product&rsquo; and a preparatory license allows approved licensees to fulfill all pre-conditions required to undertake MVP operations within the VARA regime. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Binance itself received its own MVP license last September 2022. All of these point to the UAE&rsquo;s pro-crypto environment and why numerous crypto businesses are eyeing to expand on the country. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a clear framework for people and businesses to engage with, whereas you&rsquo;re just not seeing as much of that elsewhere,&rdquo; Chehade said.</p>
Contrasts and Regulation
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This is in contrast to the United States and the SEC. Binance is currently in the middle of a dispute with the United States&rsquo; SEC and has just filed a lawsuit against the commission last June 23. The SEC and its chairman Gary Gensler in particular, have not flinched on their hardline stance against virtual assets and businesses and there seem to be no signs of a shift anytime soon.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Binance's interest in Dubai emphasizes the potential for countries with forward-thinking policies to position themselves as global crypto centers. By welcoming industry leaders like Binance, they can drive innovation and economic growth. Conversely, regulatory hostility or uncertainty, as observed in the US, can deter businesses and stifle the sector's development.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The implications of Binance's strategic move extend beyond individual companies or countries. This shift illustrates a key aspect of the future growth of the cryptocurrency industry &ndash; the necessity of harmonious interaction between crypto businesses and regulatory bodies. While the robustness and security of the crypto market are paramount, overregulation can inhibit innovation and advancement. Striking this delicate balance could determine the trajectory of the global crypto landscape.</p>

The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s5">Polkadot (DOT), one of Ethereum&rsquo;s biggest rivals, has announced an update to its governance system, removing the voting group formerly referred to as &lsquo;First Class Citizen&rsquo; from the network.

▪ Polkadot (DOT) has entered into a new era after a major update to its governance system
▪ The update has made the Polkadot network more decentralized by eliminating &lsquo;First Class Citizen&rsquo; groups
▪ A new hybrid exchange, Tradecurve (TCRV) will integrate AI into its trading platform to allow for AI-assisted trading.
Polkadot Makes Update to its Governance System
<p class="s5">Polkadot (DOT), a major Ethereum challenger, has announced a major update to its governance system to take the network into a new era of decentralization. As part of the network update, Polkadot launched OpenGov to give the Polkadot community full control of the network by allowing holders of the DOT token to vote and propose referenda to make changes to the network.</p>
<p class="s5">Polkadot hopes to transform its network into a fully autonomous, transparent, &amp; efficient decision-making network by giving users equal rights to vote. As a result, OpenGov has removed the so-called first-class voters like the Polkadot Council and the Technical Committee from the voting. Now, the amount of DOT tokens a holder has determines their voting strength.</p>
<p class="s5">In addition, this new governance infrastructure will allow for multiple governance proposals to be simultaneously voted on by the Polkadot community. With OpenGove in place, Polkadot has been transformed into a fully decentralized Web 3 project where all the governance processes are directly controlled by its community members.</p>
<p></p>
Tradecurve to Integrate AI Support Into Its Hybrid Exchange
<p class="s5">Since the launch of OpenAI&rsquo;s ChatGPT in November 2022, many projects have been exploring the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space.</p>
<p class="s5">Tradecurve is a new hybrid exchange that is building the first crypto-exchange platform with AI integration to support algorithmic or automated trading.</p>
<p class="s5">With the inclusion of AI-assisted trading, Tradecurve users will be able to leverage the advanced mathematical models of the platform to make trading decisions. The AI trading feature of the platform will support several variables, including price, timing, and volume, for users to place trades automatically.</p>
<p class="s5">To add to AI trading, Tradecurve will also support copy trading. With this feature, traders can directly copy the trading positions of other more successful traders on Tradecurve.</p>
<p class="s5">As a hybrid exchange, Tradecurve combines the best features known to centralized exchanges (CEXs) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to create a well-rounded platform. Tradecurve is currently in the fourth stage of its presale, where its native utility token currently retails for $0.018 apiece, but is expected to rise by up to 40% in the upcoming week.</p>

<p class="s5">Polkadot (DOT), a major Ethereum challenger, has announced a major update to its governance system to take the network into a new era of decentralization. As part of the network update, Polkadot launched OpenGov to give the Polkadot community full control of the network by allowing holders of the DOT token to vote and propose referenda to make changes to the network.</p>
<p class="s5">Polkadot hopes to transform its network into a fully autonomous, transparent, &amp; efficient decision-making network by giving users equal rights to vote. As a result, OpenGov has removed the so-called first-class voters like the Polkadot Council and the Technical Committee from the voting. Now, the amount of DOT tokens a holder has determines their voting strength.</p>
<p class="s5">In addition, this new governance infrastructure will allow for multiple governance proposals to be simultaneously voted on by the Polkadot community. With OpenGove in place, Polkadot has been transformed into a fully decentralized Web 3 project where all the governance processes are directly controlled by its community members.</p>
<p></p>
Tradecurve to Integrate AI Support Into Its Hybrid Exchange
<p class="s5">Since the launch of OpenAI&rsquo;s ChatGPT in November 2022, many projects have been exploring the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space.</p>
<p class="s5">Tradecurve is a new hybrid exchange that is building the first crypto-exchange platform with AI integration to support algorithmic or automated trading.</p>
<p class="s5">With the inclusion of AI-assisted trading, Tradecurve users will be able to leverage the advanced mathematical models of the platform to make trading decisions. The AI trading feature of the platform will support several variables, including price, timing, and volume, for users to place trades automatically.</p>
<p class="s5">To add to AI trading, Tradecurve will also support copy trading. With this feature, traders can directly copy the trading positions of other more successful traders on Tradecurve.</p>
<p class="s5">As a hybrid exchange, Tradecurve combines the best features known to centralized exchanges (CEXs) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to create a well-rounded platform. Tradecurve is currently in the fourth stage of its presale, where its native utility token currently retails for $0.018 apiece, but is expected to rise by up to 40% in the upcoming week.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Japanese tax administration has offered companies that issue cryptocurrencies a 30% tax break under a revision of its corporate tax rules. </p>
<p>Japan&rsquo;s National Tax Agency (NTA) has revised its corporate tax rules to provide a tax exemption to companies issuing cryptocurrencies. Under the revised regulations, companies will no longer be taxed on unrealized gains. Under the previous rules, companies issuing cryptocurrencies were taxed on unrealized gains at the end of a tax period.</p>
<p>The NTA explained that companies&rsquo; holdings would be excluded from the market evaluation of a company&rsquo;s assets if specific terms are met.</p>
<p>Japan&rsquo;s previously harsh tax regulations forced many domestically established crypto and blockchain firms to set up shop elsewhere. Japan&rsquo;s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) approved the proposal for the revised rules in December to improve business conditions for companies issuing cryptocurrencies in Japan.</p>
Japan Introduces Stricter AML Measures
<p>The Japanese crypto industry is changing after introducing stricter anti-money laundering (AML) procedures. Since June 1, tougher AML measures were introduced to trace crypto transactions to align Japan&rsquo;s legal framework with international crypto laws after its AML measures were found to be lacking by the Financial Action Task Force. The cabinet revised the relevant crypto rules in December, focusing on monitoring the movement of illicit funds under the pretext of legal crypto transactions.</p>
<p>Japan is such a significant player in the global crypto market, and the government was forced to address the risk associated with the industry.</p>
<p>Part of Japan&rsquo;s stricter policy includes the enforcement of the &ldquo;Travel Rule.&rdquo; The Travel Rule aims to ensure the precise monitoring of illicit proceeds. Under this rule, any financial institution processing a crypto transfer exceeding $3,000 must share customer information with the recipient exchange or institution.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>If you're a crypto enthusiast seeking the next big investment opportunity or simply looking for meme coins with utility, you're in the right place. In this article, we'll explore the top cryptos of 2023, including Cardano, Solana, Avalanche, Ripple, and the newcomer, Caged Beasts (BEASTS).</p>
1. Caged Beasts: Instant 20% USDT On Referrals
<p>Caged Beasts (BEASTS) is not your ordinary meme coin. With its vibrant art style and rewarding referral system, it sets itself apart from the other meme coins littering the market. It has just gone live with the first stage of its presale.</p>
<p>The nascent meme coin rewards members of the community who actively participate in growing the community through its referral system. This system operates by allowing users to generate a shareable custom code that they can send to their friends to invite them to the community. When someone makes a purchase with this code, the referrer instantly receives 20% of the deposit made by the friend in BNB, USDT, or ETH, while the referred friend receives an extra 20% on top of their purchase as a welcome gift.</p>
2. Avalanche: Riding the Wave of Potential
<p>With a $0.18 increase in value over the past 24 hours and a 1.06% upward trend in the last 7 days, Avalanche (AVAX) is capturing the attention of investors. In the last month alone, AVAX's price has risen by 22.61%, demonstrating its ability to be a solid asset if the current trend persists. Looking ahead to the rest of the year, price predictions for Avalanche range from a minimum of $10.04 to a maximum of $9.98, with an average trading price projected around $9.92, and an estimated ROI of -11.7%.</p>
<p></p>
3. Cardano: Top Crypto Of 2023?
<p>Cardano (ADA) is another crypto project that has been gaining momentum recently. With a $0.01 increase in value within the past 24 hours and a promising 6.37% upward trend over the last 7 days, Cardano presents a favorable investment opportunity. The growth of ADA, as evidenced by a 28.45% increase in the last month, positions it as a solid asset for those looking for long-term gains.</p>
<p>In 2023, price predictions for Cardano range from a minimum of $0.173 to a maximum of $0.282, with an average trading price projected around $0.391, and an estimated ROI of 8.5%.</p>
<p>4. Ripple: Recovering From Legal Trouble</p>
<p>Ripple (XRP) seems to be recovering well from its case against the SEC. With a $0.0010 increase in value over the past 24 hours and a positive trend of 5.24% in the last 7 days, XRP continues to show promise. While the growth may be more modest compared to other projects, a 4.75% increase in the last month indicates the reliability of XRP as an asset.</p>
<p>For 2023, Ripple's price predictions range from a minimum of $0.422 to a maximum of $0.489, with an average trading price projected around $0.555. Although the potential ROI is estimated at -0.2%.</p>
<p></p>
<p>5. Solana: Harnessing the Power of Innovation</p>
<p>Solana (SOL) has been making waves with its recent positive trend, with a $0.02 increase in value within the past 24 hours and a 2.98% upward trend over the last 7 days, Solana presents a favorable investment opportunity. The growth of SOL, as evidenced by a 22.44% increase in the last month, indicates its potential as a reliable asset.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you're a crypto enthusiast seeking the next big investment opportunity or simply looking for meme coins with utility, you're in the right place. In this article, we'll explore the top cryptos of 2023, including Cardano, Solana, Avalanche, Ripple, and the newcomer, Caged Beasts (BEASTS).</p>
1. Caged Beasts: Instant 20% USDT On Referrals
<p>Caged Beasts (BEASTS) is not your ordinary meme coin. With its vibrant art style and rewarding referral system, it sets itself apart from the other meme coins littering the market. It has just gone live with the first stage of its presale.</p>
<p>The nascent meme coin rewards members of the community who actively participate in growing the community through its referral system. This system operates by allowing users to generate a shareable custom code that they can send to their friends to invite them to the community. When someone makes a purchase with this code, the referrer instantly receives 20% of the deposit made by the friend in BNB, USDT, or ETH, while the referred friend receives an extra 20% on top of their purchase as a welcome gift.</p>
2. Avalanche: Riding the Wave of Potential
<p>With a $0.18 increase in value over the past 24 hours and a 1.06% upward trend in the last 7 days, Avalanche (AVAX) is capturing the attention of investors. In the last month alone, AVAX's price has risen by 22.61%, demonstrating its ability to be a solid asset if the current trend persists. Looking ahead to the rest of the year, price predictions for Avalanche range from a minimum of $10.04 to a maximum of $9.98, with an average trading price projected around $9.92, and an estimated ROI of -11.7%.</p>
<p></p>
3. Cardano: Top Crypto Of 2023?
<p>Cardano (ADA) is another crypto project that has been gaining momentum recently. With a $0.01 increase in value within the past 24 hours and a promising 6.37% upward trend over the last 7 days, Cardano presents a favorable investment opportunity. The growth of ADA, as evidenced by a 28.45% increase in the last month, positions it as a solid asset for those looking for long-term gains.</p>
<p>In 2023, price predictions for Cardano range from a minimum of $0.173 to a maximum of $0.282, with an average trading price projected around $0.391, and an estimated ROI of 8.5%.</p>
<p>4. Ripple: Recovering From Legal Trouble</p>
<p>Ripple (XRP) seems to be recovering well from its case against the SEC. With a $0.0010 increase in value over the past 24 hours and a positive trend of 5.24% in the last 7 days, XRP continues to show promise. While the growth may be more modest compared to other projects, a 4.75% increase in the last month indicates the reliability of XRP as an asset.</p>
<p>For 2023, Ripple's price predictions range from a minimum of $0.422 to a maximum of $0.489, with an average trading price projected around $0.555. Although the potential ROI is estimated at -0.2%.</p>
<p></p>
<p>5. Solana: Harnessing the Power of Innovation</p>
<p>Solana (SOL) has been making waves with its recent positive trend, with a $0.02 increase in value within the past 24 hours and a 2.98% upward trend over the last 7 days, Solana presents a favorable investment opportunity. The growth of SOL, as evidenced by a 22.44% increase in the last month, indicates its potential as a reliable asset.</p>
<p>Looking into 2023, price predictions for Solana suggest a minimum price of $11.42 and a maximum price of $16.52, with an average trading price projected around $21.61. With an estimated ROI of 6.5%, Solana showcases its potential to deliver strong returns and captivate its community.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Blockchain-based lending platform Soil says it&rsquo;s ready for prime time after achieving compliance with Estonia&rsquo;s local financial markets regulator.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The startup has created a decentralized finance protocol that aims to bridge the gap between borrowers such as businesses and private debt foundations, and stablecoin holders who wish to lend their capital to earn yield. The&nbsp; protocol hosts a debt marketplace through which borrowers can obtain financing using tokenized collateral. Lenders, who pledge capital to Soil&rsquo;s marketplace, will earn a highly competitive yield on their stablecoins, Soil says. The protocol&rsquo;s revenue is derived from fees earned for connecting borrowers to lenders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Soil said its platform&rsquo;s compliance with Estonian regulations is a key step for the company as it confirms the validity of its business model. According to Soil Chief Executive Jakub Bojan, the company hired teams of lawyers from multiple jurisdictions to ensure its protocol would be validated by local regulators.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Despite this great success, we continue to work and do our best to ensure that our project is at the forefront of the cryptocurrency market and is transparent and safe for our partners and investors around the world,&rdquo; Bojan added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Soil explained that the security and compliance of its platform is a major priority for the company, as it seeks to position itself for the EU&rsquo;s upcoming MICA regulation, which aims to protect consumers from the risks associated with investing in digital assets. The new legislation ensures that crypto asset service providers respect strong requirements to protect user&rsquo;s wallets, and have certain liabilities in cases where customer&rsquo;s assets are lost. The legislation also covers aspects such as market manipulation and insider dealing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Soil said the solid legal support, along with its innovative business model, means that it&rsquo;s well positioned to inspire greater confidence in the DeFi ecosystem among investors.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>After hitting a local high at over $31,000, bitcoin looks to be regrouping ready for another leg higher.</p>
<p>That bitcoin has broken out and that a strong uptrend is forming is not in much doubt. The higher high has been made and bitcoin is currently buoyed up by the strong horizontal support at $30,300.</p>
<p>If what is happening with the traditional monetary system is taken into account bitcoin would appear to be a complete no-brainer as a means of moving wealth out of the system and into bitcoin where it cannot be manipulated, more of it cannot be printed, and where it cannot be confiscated.</p>
More currency will be printed
<p>The mainstream narrative of whether the Federal Reserve will or will not pivot into quantitative easing and start printing more currency is not really here nor there, at least in the long term. That it will print more currency is an absolute certainty given the economics of a debt-based system.</p>
How will bitcoin bear up?
<p>However, many economic commentators are of the opinion that bitcoin will suffer greatly as liquidity becomes more scarce and a descent into what could be a dreadful recession provokes a massive sell-off in risk assets.</p>
<p>Bitcoin has never had to deal with such an environment in all of its lifetime so far, so it is going to be extremely interesting to see how it will bear up among other financial assets.</p>
<p>It must be said that it was built for exactly this. When Satoshi Nakamoto launched bitcoin the Genesis block bore the text:</p>

<p>Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks</p>

<p>This was a reference to the Times newspaper of January 3 2009, when the Great Recession was in full swing and the world was on the brink of economic catastrophe.</p>
<p>Satoshi Nakamoto realised that people would need a lifeline to get them out of constant debasement of the currency and an ever-increasing chance of complete economic meltdown.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is due to start its bull market and with its halving coming in April next year it does look like an incredibly good bet. On the other hand, if one holds fiat currency its inherent debasement is an absolute certainty. Education oneself on these matters is the only way to be able to survive what is coming.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Blockchain users could be forgiven for losing count of the number of different networks they interact with. As established blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum experience limitations over the number of use cases they support and their scalability, crypto projects are looking to newer chains to support their activities. By building on alternative blockchains, projects can tap into the new capabilities they offer and benefit from faster transactions and lower processing costs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, the number of blockchain networks competing for market share in industries like decentralized finance, gaming, metaverse, and other areas is growing. There is no single blockchain that has emerged as the platform for every type of use case, as each network comes with trade-offs. As a result, developers simply select the most appropriate blockchain for whatever it is they&rsquo;re trying to achieve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The Need For Interoperability
<p>Given this reality, it has become clear that a solution for blockchain interoperability is imperative for all users. In a world where businesses of every shape and size are so reliant on collaboration, it&rsquo;s necessary to find a way for the different blockchains they use to safely interact with one another. By building interoperability, networks provide a more user-friendly experience, enabling frictionless sharing of data and smoother execution of transactions governed by smart contracts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With traditional software systems, the makers of those programs and applications strive for interoperability as they know it&rsquo;s beneficial for their users. For instance, imagine if it were not possible to send an email from a Gmail account to a Yahoo account. It would throw a massive spanner in the works of mass communication. As such, software has become highly integrated in many ways. Not only can we email any address from any provider, but we can also import our contacts into messenger software like Skype. In the enterprise world, software interoperability is even more important, allowing business workers to import data from Salesforce into Excel spreadsheets where it can be analyzed, for example.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blockchain networks recognize that use cases such as DeFi, healthcare, gaming, and digital identity cannot exist in siloes, and so interoperability has become a key goal of most projects. Luckily for blockchain users, a number of projects have made rapid progress in this area, enabling both data and digital assets to traverse across blockchain networks with remarkable ease.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
How Blockchain Interoperability Is Achieved
<p>One of the most successful examples of blockchain interoperability is the Cosmos ecosystem, which bills itself as the &ldquo;Internet of blockchains&rdquo;. Within Cosmos, developers can access a wealth of applications and services built for distributed networks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cosmos enables blockchain interoperability through its Inter Blockchain Protocol, known as IBC. It supports a suite of cross-chain applications and makes it possible for users to exchange data and digital assets freely across multiple supported blockchains, including Binance Chain and Crypto.org.&nbsp;</p>
<p>IBC is best understood as an open-source protocol that works by relaying messages between independent blockchain networks, and linking them together. Because not every chain is IBC compatible, Cosmos has gotten around this with the introduction of a &ldquo;peg zone&rdquo; that&rsquo;s able to bridge zones within Cosmos to external blockchains such as Ethereum and Bitcoin. Cosmos also offers a software development kit that can be used by coders to create alternative versions of their dApps for different, compatible blockchains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another blockchain that&rsquo;s following the ecosystem approach is Polkadot, which has developed a network of interoperable parachains that are linked to its central Relay Chain. Each of the parachains on Polkadot&rsquo;s network hosts its own, specific project or dApp, with some of the most interesting being Moonbeam, Centrifuge, Manta Network, and Parallel Finance. Each parachain is designed in a way that ensures optimal performance for the specific dApp it supports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To ensure scalability, Polkadot provides a common set of validators for every parachain within its ecosystem. By spreading transactions across its ecosystem of parachains, they can be processed faster. At the same time, because the parachains all share the same architecture, they all support cross-chain transactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Polkadot is strongly supportive of developers too. It&rsquo;s possible to create a customized blockchain using Substrate that&rsquo;s natively compatible with all other chains on the Polkadot network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Horizen bills itself as the most secure, interoperable blockchain ecosystem supported by the most decentralized, multi-tier node infrastructure in the crypto industry. It enables interoperability between blockchains through a protocol called Zendoo, which uses a novel sidechain construction that&rsquo;s tailored to be compatible with Horizen&rsquo;s main chain while adapting to other blockchains. Secure, decentralized cross-chain communications are conducted via a sidechain that&rsquo;s enhanced with privacy-preserving zk-SNARK technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Zendoo, a Bitcoin-based protocol can operate with any other domain-specific blockchain or blockchain-like ecosystem, with the protocol only updated once to introduce the required mechanism for deploying sidechains that enable cross-chain transfers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One key advantage of Horizen&rsquo;s method is that Zendoo enables backward transfers to be verified by the main chain without the use of external certifiers or validators. In other words, the main chain does not monitor the sidechains and knows nothing about their internal structure, boosting security. Zendoo does this through the generation of recursive proofs of each sidechain state transition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any discussion of blockchain interoperability should also mention the efforts of Chainlink, which is a Web3 platform that provides oracle services to smart contracts hosted on any blockchain network. Its primary focus is not so much on blockchain-to-blockchain interactions, but rather on enabling smart contracts to interact with real-world networks. It gives new industries access to any blockchain, enabling dApps to integrate with Web2 software and systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oracles play a key role in facilitating communication between blockchains and things that happen in the real world. For example, they allow blockchains to monitor traditional financial markets, and react to events such as sports results, the weather, and more. By enabling this kind of interoperability, Chainlink is emerging as a crucial link between blockchains and third-party data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Blockchain Interoperability Is Crucial
<p>The success of any dApp has long been tied to its ability to interact with the growing number of blockchain networks and legacy-based systems in the world. Blockchain interoperability is crucial because it lowers the barrier of entry, enabling more users to engage with protocols and conduct transactions freely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As blockchain interoperability has improved thanks to the efforts mentioned above, users now have multiple ways to move their data and assets across networks, making the dApps that use them much more flexible. Instead of being restricted to a single blockchain, smart contracts can now interact with almost any network and even tap into real-world data. Interoperability allows dApps to support more flexible use cases, helping to spur more widespread adoption of crypto in general.&nbsp;</p>
