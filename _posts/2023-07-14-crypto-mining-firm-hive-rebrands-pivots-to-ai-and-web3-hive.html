<p class="md-end-block md-p">Crypto mining company Hive Blockchain Technologies has unveiled its new brand identity, Hive Digital Technologies, representing a strategic shift towards artificial intelligence (AI).</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Canadian firm aims to leverage its vast Nvidia graphics processing unit (GPU) fleet to tap into burgeoning opportunities in AI and cloud computing.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">An Evolved Focus</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In a statement issued on July 12, Hive Digital revealed that the updated brand better represents the company's current focus. In the burgeoning era of GPU cloud technology, Hive is poised to expand its Nvidia GPU-oriented revenue channels while also contributing to AI advancements that propel the new Web3 ecosystem.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">According to Hive's CEO Aydin Kilic, the company plans to grow its cloud hosting business using its extensive GPU fleet, recognising the growing demand driven by AI and machine learning applications. In addition to crypto mining, Hive will offer rental services of GPU server clusters and introduce a new service, HIVE Cloud. The service targets small and medium-sized businesses, offering them an efficient and cost-effective alternative to major cloud service providers.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">From Crypto Mining to AI Cloud Services</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Established in 2017, Hive has been a pioneer in the cryptocurrency mining sector. Despite maintaining a strong presence in Bitcoin mining, the company sees tremendous potential in leveraging its 38,000 Nvidia GPU fleet for large-scale computational tasks.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Hive has been using these high-performance GPUs to mine Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network. However, since Ethereum transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism in September 2022, reducing the profitability of mining, the company has been exploring other revenue streams for its GPUs.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Hive's rebranding comes as several mining companies pivot from their original blockchain-focused models. Earlier this year, Riot Blockchain, a Bitcoin mining firm, rebranded to Riot Platforms to reflect its diversified business operations.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Projected Market Impact</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In an official press release, Hive's Executive Chairman, Frank Holmes, expressed optimism for the AI sector's potential, highlighting large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT as a driving factor. According to Holmes, the high-margin business opportunity with their Nvidia GPU cards could generate over $100,000,000 in annual revenues.</p>
