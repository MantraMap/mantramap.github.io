TUSD has added more than a billion dollars&#8217; worth of tokens to its existing supply. As of the present moment, the market capitalization of TUSD stands at approximately $3.13 billion.</strong></p>
<h2>TUSD&#8217;s Supply Spiked 52% on June 16, Rising by a Billion Tokens</h2>
<p>In a recent stablecoin update, Bitcoin.com News <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/stablecoin-economy-reaches-20-month-low-as-busd-redemptions-surpass-10-billion-tokens-in-3-months/">shed light</a> on the challenging times faced by the dollar-pegged token economy, with significant redemptions causing its market valuation to plummet to its lowest point in 20 months. As of June 19, 2023, the collective market capitalization of the leading stablecoins amounts to <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/stablecoins">$129.99 billion</a>, while these tokens have witnessed global trade volume of $20.84 billion in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>Notably, three of the top five stablecoins in terms of market capitalization, namely USDC, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/dai-emerges-as-third-largest-stablecoin-overtaking-busd-in-market-capitalization/">DAI</a>, and BUSD, have experienced supply reductions ranging from 3.8% to 22% over the past 30 days. <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/TUSD/">TUSD</a>, on the other hand, has witnessed a supply increase of about 53.5% over the past month.</p>
<p>The stablecoin experienced a surge in market valuation on July 16, 2023, reaching $3.11 billion, a substantial jump from the previous day&#8217;s $2.04 billion. This means that while TUSD grew by 53.5% within 30 days, a single day last Friday accounted for 52% of that increase. According to the <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x0000000000085d4780B73119b644AE5ecd22b376">smart contract data</a> on <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/etherscan-unveils-code-reader-an-ai-powered-tool-that-aims-to-bolster-smart-contract-analysis/">Etherscan</a>, the circulating supply of TUSD tokens on June 19 is approximately 3,135,633,560.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-594127 size-full" title="TUSD Supply Skyrockets With 1 Billion Injection Amidst Decline in Stablecoins" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/gg4445alenn.jpg" alt="TUSD Supply Skyrockets With 1 Billion Injection Amidst Decline in Stablecoins" width="1280" height="850" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/gg4445alenn-300x199.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/gg4445alenn-1024x680.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/gg4445alenn-768x510.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/gg4445alenn.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>Interestingly, despite there being 52,079 TUSD holders, the top 10 wallets control <a href="https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/true-usd/richlist/">83.31%</a> of the circulating supply. Among the top ten wallets, Binance emerges as the largest holder with its leading address containing 389,561,743 TUSD tokens. Moreover, out of the top ten addresses with the highest TUSD holdings,  controls five of them.</p>

<p>The crypto exchange, known for its substantial trade volume, also possesses another wallet with 45,233,811 TUSD, one with precisely 28,000,000, another with 10,601,602, and lastly, one holding 10,270,001 TUSD. Additionally, the decentralized finance (defi) protocol Aave has locked 4,780,182 TUSD for its aTUSD tokens.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://portfolio.nansen.ai/dashboard/binance">statistics</a> from Nansen.ai, Binance&#8217;s TUSD stash accounts for 5.26% of the exchange&#8217;s $52.45 billion portfolio. TUSD was introduced in mid-2018 through the Trust Token platform as an ERC20-based stablecoin. It <a href="https://tusd.io/">asserts</a> to be entirely backed by U.S. Dollars and overseen by a regulated operator.</p>
<p>The stablecoin company also collaborated with the custodian <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/custodian-prime-trusts-payments-subsidiary-banq-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection/">Prime Trust</a>, the company that Bitgo <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/digital-asset-trust-firm-bitgo-sets-sights-on-prime-trust-acquisition/">expressed intentions</a> of acquiring. However, earlier this month, the team&#8217;s Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/tusdio/status/1667386940948369408?s=20">disclosed</a> that &#8220;TUSD mints via Prime Trust are paused&#8221; until further notice. On Monday, at 8:58 a.m. Eastern Time, the company reiterated that mints via Prime Trust remain unavailable.</p>
<p>“In view of the uncertainty, minting through Prime Trust is still temporarily paused while minting/redemption through our other banking partners are unaffected,” the company <a href="https://twitter.com/tusdio/status/1670778081769033728?s=20">tweeted</a>. “We will resume Prime Trust process when the circumstances improve. Thanks for your patience.”</p>

The central bank said the launch of the platform is expected to help reduce local demand for the greenback. Governor John Mangudya said the tokens have a value which is &#8220;linked to the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA).&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>&#8216;Gold Token&#8217; Bank Accounts</h2>
<p>The Zimbabwean central bank has said it is &#8220;finalizing&#8221; the establishment of a peer-to-peer (P2P) platform which is expected to facilitate digital gold token transactions. According to a June 17 Sunday Mail report, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) hopes to launch the platform towards the end of the month.</p>
<p>The P2P platform is part of the central bank’s measures which seek to diminish local demand for the U.S. dollar and to stabilize the Zimbabwean dollar. The latest digital gold token announcement by the RBZ came just a few weeks after it launched a gold-backed digital currency. As <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-zimbabwes-central-bank-says-upcoming-gold-backed-digital-currency-to-help-reduce-demand-for-us-dollar/">reported</a> by Bitcoin.com News at the time, the RBZ initially said the tokens &#8220;would be used both as a means of payment and a store of value.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the Sunday Mail <a href="https://www.sundaymail.co.zw/rbz-finalises-platform-for-digital-token-payments">report</a>, holders of the digital gold tokens will be required to open &#8220;gold token&#8221; bank accounts which in turn will be converted to a U.S. dollar-benchmarked value system. The report added that the gold tokens will also be added to the mix of currencies which are legal tender in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h2>P2P Platform Undergoing Tests</h2>
<p>The report revealed that the central bank has sold some 313.9 kilograms of gold-backed digital tokens so far, and also quotes the RBZ governor revealing that the P2P platform is currently undergoing tests.</p>
<p>&#8220;The second phase of the rollout of the digital gold tokens, which will enable transacting using the gold-backed digital currency, will start this month, and we are currently testing the system before launch,&#8221; Mangudya said.</p>
<p>The RBZ governor also said the tokens have a value which is linked to the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA). He added that the digital gold tokens will be stored in a special wallet known as an e-gold wallet or gold card.</p>
<p>Persistence Gwanyanya, an economist and a member of the central bank’s monetary policy committee, is quoted in the same report hailing the measures taken by the RBZ. Gwanyanya said he expects to start seeing positive results in the coming weeks.</p>

In a rapidly evolving and challenging crypto landscape, they discussed the pressing issues and opportunities to shape a better future for the Web3 space.</b></p>
<p>As a result of these two days of intensive talks, the Proof of Talk constitution was presented, 10 commitments to truly revolutionize the Web3 industry: transparency, community engagement, education, ethical conduct, best practices, collaboration, inclusivity, long-term vision, accountability, and advocating for positive change.</p>
<p>“<i>These two days of talks have shown us that the Web3 industry, which is based on a strong sense of community, shared leadership and transparency, is ready to move to the next stage.”, said </i><b><i>Zohair Dehnadi, </i></b><b>Co-Founder &amp; Partner, X Ventures who organized the Summit.</b></p>
<p><b>Learning from the past to build the future of Web3</b></p>
<p>“<i>We are at a crossroads right now, not only in the industry, but in the world as a whole. How we forge the path forward as pioneers in this paradigm shift is crucial</i>”, highlighted <b>Megan Nilsson (Crypto Megan)</b>, the conference MC when introducing the conversation.</p>
<p>Among the key takeaways from the 100+ speakers from all sides of the industry and beyond who joined, <b>Yat Siu, Co-Founder &amp; Executive Chairman of Animoca Brands.</b></p>
<p>emphasized that: &#8220;<i>People joining your vision are joining something bigger than their own. Just like education, which touches all of us, NFTs provide a great way to develop new opportunities. Teachers deserve to make more money, and one potential avenue could be through NFTs in the educational sector.“</i></p>
<p>When discussing decentralization, <b>Pascal Gauthier, CEO of Ledger </b>pointed out that “<i>Interestingly, in the realm of crypto, the playing field is different. Unlike other sectors, it is the first domain where the United States and China are not leading due to regulatory constraints. This presents a unique opportunity for Europe, marking the first time it is not losing the game but actively participating and shaping the future.&#8221; </i></p>
<p><b>Among the main takeaways from conversations with Matthias Reiser </b>(Co-Founder &amp; Partner, X Ventures), <b>Neil-Cunha-Gomes </b>(Head of EMEA Fintech, Softbank Vision Fund)<b>, Nicolas Louvet </b>(CEO, Coinhouse)<b>, Kate Levchuk </b>(Institutional Sales, CEX.IO)<b>, Ivan De Lastours </b>(Blockchain/Crypto Lead, BPI France)<b>, James Tromans </b>(Director, Google Cloud Web3)<b>, David Uhryniak </b>(Director of Ecosystem Development, Tron)<b>, Alexis du Peloux </b>(Partner, XAnge)<b>, Alex Odagiu </b>(Investment Director, Binance Labs)<b>, Christian Rau </b>(Senior VP Fintech and Crypto Enablement Europe, Mastercard)<b>, Elise Yoshida </b>(Digital and Web3 Communications Director, Christian Louboutin),<b> Caroline Malcom, </b>(VP Global Public Policy, Chainalysis),<b> Joseph Collement </b>(General Counsel, Bitcoin.com),<b> Kunal Bhasin </b>(Director &amp; Co-Lead Crypto assets &amp; Blockchain CoE, KPMG), <b>Alban Vendeuvre</b> (Investor, Cathay Ledger Fund), <b>Nova Lorraine</b>, Author, Designer &amp; Editor in Chief, Raine Magazine</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">The importance of actively participating in regulation to ensure that regulators understand the real problems being solved by crypto companies. Regulation is needed to establish trust and create a framework for the crypto industry. Banks and traditional financial institutions also need to better understand the risk-reward proposition of leveraging technology in the crypto space.</li>
<li aria-level="1">The future of centralized exchanges (CEX) innovation may lead to unforeseen changes in the landscape. the potential influence of AI agents, the importance of financial support and community assistance</li>
<li aria-level="1">The importance of UX and user-friendly interfaces for governance. Good UX leads to understanding, engagement, and adoption, thereby removing barriers to participation. The integrity of governance and cross-chain compatibility are also key considerations for lowering barriers</li>
</ul>
<p>The themed workshops also enabled participants to engage in practical activities and delve into the intricacies of tokenomics, strategies to build a successful Web3 marketing pipeline, and who to navigate fundraising in bear market conditions.</p>

This proposal, put forward by Michael Neuder, a researcher from the Ethereum Foundation, aims to address concerns related to decentralization, inflation, and the size of the validator set. Neuder acknowledges that the existing threshold promotes decentralization, but he also highlights the drawbacks of inflation and the substantial number of validators that it entails.</strong></p>
<h2>Ethereum Developers Want to Raise the Validator Threshold</h2>
<p>During the latest Ethereum core developer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/ybgQuRcz9sg?feature=share">consensus meeting</a>, a gathering of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> software engineers and researchers, an intriguing notion emerged for elevating the validator threshold from 32 ether to 2,048 ether. As it stands, aspiring validators must possess roughly 32 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> to commence the validation process, but this proposed adjustment would amplify the threshold by 64-fold.</p>
<p>The individual behind this idea is Michael Neuder, a researcher from the Ethereum Foundation, who presented his proposal titled &#x201C;Increase the Max_Effective_Balance.&#x201D; In addition to this proposition, Neuder delved into the realm of auto-compounding validator rewards, stimulating further contemplation and dialogue among the attendees.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Without a validator set contraction, single-slot finality is not feasible using the <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/a-simple-single-slot-finality-protocol/14920">current</a> <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/horn-collecting-signatures-for-faster-finality/14219">designs</a>,&#x201D; Neuder&#x2019;s proposal details. &#x201C;Without single-slot finality, we believe that enshrined PBS is also not viable. Additionally, the current p2p layer is <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/removing-unnecessary-stress-from-ethereums-p2p-network/15547">heavily burdened</a> by the artificially large and rapidly growing validator set (see <a href="https://twitter.com/potuz1/status/1657031082749861891">this thread</a> from Potuz outlining what happened during the May 12 non-finality event). We see a validator set contraction as a must-have for a sustainable and upgradable Ethereum consensus layer.&#x201D;</p>
<p>According to the researcher, implementing this increase would not only enhance Ethereum&#x2019;s overall efficiency but also alleviate the rapid expansion of the validator set. He insists the proposal holds the potential to address the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/temporary-transaction-finality-glitch-disrupts-ethereum-network-for-25-minutes-developers-investigate-the-cause/">finality issues</a> that plagued the Beacon chain in <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ethereum-patch-set-to-fix-transaction-finality-challenges-after-second-bout-disrupts-network/">May 2023</a>. Subsequently, numerous individuals took to the ethresear.ch web portal to voice their thoughts on the proposed escalation of the validator threshold.</p>

<h2>The Move Could Potentially Marginalize Home Stakers</h2>
<p>The divergent opinions expressed on this matter underscore the existing divide among Ethereum advocates and researchers, revealing a compelling discourse within the community.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This would significantly decrease &#x2018;real&#x2019; decentralization by effectively raising the 32 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> solo staking floor to whatever the new EB value would be,&#x201D; the Cookie Lab <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/increase-the-max-effective-balance-a-modest-proposal/15801/2">stated</a> in response to Neuder&#x2019;s proposal. &#x201C;Sure while one can still spin up a validator with 32 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>, its influence would be one of a second-class citizen when compared to one with &#x2018;maxed out&#x2019; EB.&#x201D; Others favored the concept of auto-compounding rewards.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The benefit of compounding rewards for solo stakers is pretty large, and their chance of proposing doesn&#x2019;t fall due to a change in Max EB, only an increase of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> being staked by others,&#x201D; another person <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/increase-the-max-effective-balance-a-modest-proposal/15801/3">wrote</a>.</p>
<p>Neuder&#x2019;s proposal is anticipated to spark prolonged debates among the core developers, as they have chosen to delve deeper into this concept on Discord. A notable faction contends that embracing the idea may inadvertently foster centralization within the Ethereum network, exacerbating the preexisting challenges faced by the validator set.</p>
<p>Amidst the varied opinions, one individual expressed affinity for the proposal but raised a pertinent concern, <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/increase-the-max-effective-balance-a-modest-proposal/15801/14">emphasizing</a>, &#x201C;[My] main concern with the proposal as currently written is that it seems to degrade the UX for home stakers.&#x201D; This consequential move could potentially marginalize home stakers, resulting in a landscape where corporate entities and affluent individuals dominate the network, leaving behind an altered power dynamic.</p>

Essentially, the service leverages AI to enable users to retrieve and interpret the source code of a specific contract address.</strong></p>
<h2>Etherscan Introduces an AI-Powered Code Reader for Smart Contract Analysis</h2>
<p>On June 19, 2023, <a href="https://etherscan.io">Etherscan</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/etherscan/status/1670757723858956290?s=20">announced</a> a new feature that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) into its blockchain explorer&#x2019;s capabilities. Code Reader beta harnesses &#x201C;the power of AI to seamlessly learn about any smart contract source code,&#x201D; Etherscan said on Twitter. Additionally, Etherscan has introduced <a href="https://info.etherscan.com/code-reader/">documentation</a> on how to use the Code Reader service.</p>
<p>&#x201C;By selecting a contract address, users can access and interact with the contract&#x2019;s source code files,&#x201D; the Code Reader walkthrough article notes. The software utilizes Openai&#x2019;s large language model (LLM) and it can essentially accelerate smart contract research and development, Etherscan explained.</p>
<p>The software further &#x201C;auto-populates the contract address, source code, and AI prompts to retrieve AI-generated answers.&#x201D; Essentially, both veteran coders and newcomers can gain an understanding of a smart contract&#x2019;s operations and functionality. Etherscan said on Twitter that this is &#x201C;very much a beta release &#x2013; please let us know what you&#x2019;d like us to add or improve.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Etherscan&#x2019;s AI-powered tool follows the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/etherscan-launches-advanced-filter-for-enhanced-ethereum-blockchain-exploration/">recently introduced</a> filter tool revealed on June 2, 2023. Both tools can enhance the data for researchers, onchain sleuths, and investigators by utilizing AI or the myriad new search filters. Since the beginning of 2023, AI concepts <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ai-chatbots-weigh-in-is-bitcoin-poised-to-become-a-global-reserve-currency/">associated</a> with cryptocurrency and blockchain solutions have been emerging, including <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ai-centric-crypto-market-loses-over-1-billion-in-value-in-90-days/">AI-centric tokens</a>, along with chatbots loaded with <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-com-unveils-amy-an-ai-powered-companion-for-crypto-enthusiasts/">knowledge about cryptocurrencies</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/talk2satoshi-developer-launches-unique-ai-chatbot-infused-with-bitcoin-knowledge/">bitcoin (BTC)</a>.</p>

This strategic expansion further strengthens the company&#8217;s commitment to furnishing comprehensive asset coverage and unparalleled risk management solutions for all B2Broker customers.</p>
<p>As a multi-asset liquidity provider, B2Broker supports all major asset classes, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Rolling Spot FX &amp; Precious Metals</li>
<li aria-level="1">Equity Indices</li>
<li aria-level="1">Energies</li>
<li aria-level="1">Commodities</li>
<li aria-level="1">Crypto Derivatives/CFDs</li>
<li aria-level="1">Single Stocks/CFDs</li>
<li aria-level="1">ETFs</li>
<li aria-level="1">NDFs</li>
</ul>
<p>This accomplishment consolidates B2Broker&#8217;s leading position in the industry, demonstrating its steadfast commitment to meeting the diverse requirements of its clients.</p>
<p><b>NDFs At B2Broker</b></p>
<p>NDFs are critical financial instruments in international trade used to mitigate currency risk. They enable parties to offset potential losses resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates between two currencies. NDFs allow participants to swap the difference between a pre-agreed fixed exchange rate at the start of the contract and the current market exchange rate on a specified future date. NDFs are cash settlements, meaning they do not involve the actual exchange of the underlying currencies.</p>
<p>These instruments are particularly important in emerging markets where local currency forwards may not be feasible or available, making them effective tools for managing risk and offer companies a cost-effective approach to hedging against potential losses in cross-border transactions.</p>
<p>B2Broker offers a wide range of NDF currencies, providing customers the option to offset currency risk in various emerging markets. These NDF currencies include USD/BRL, USD/CLP, USD/COP, USD/IDR, USD/INR, USD/KRW, and USD/TWD.</p>
<p><b>Advantages Of B2Broker’s Innovative Product </b></p>
<p>B2Broker has designed NDFs based on the structure of Contracts For Differences (CFDs). Thus, unlike traditional NDFs, where settlements can take up to T+30 days, B2Broker’s clients can receive their settlements on the next business day through the CFD contracts. This innovation eliminates client settlement risks and expedites the entire process, ensuring optimal efficiency and peace of mind.</p>
<p>B2Broker’s dedication is further expressed through its commission rates, which are currently some of the lowest in the industry.</p>

As a result, he has been sentenced to four months in jail for the offense.</strong></p>
<h2>Do Kwon Sentenced to 122 Days in Prison, Defendant Has 8 Days to Appeal</h2>
<p>According to the Montenegrin court, Do Kwon, also known as Kwon Do-Hyung, has been convicted of possessing and attempting to use a counterfeit passport. The court&#8217;s <a href="https://sudovi.me/ospg/sadrzaj/D264">announcement</a> specifies that Kwon has been found guilty of the criminal offense of document forgery. Montenegrin law enforcement authorities will seize Kwon&#8217;s travel documents, which include a Costa Rican passport, a Belgian passport, and two other forms of identification.</p>
<p>The court has imposed a four-month jail sentence on Kwon, as stated in a translated court statement that mentions “all relevant circumstances were taken into consideration in determining the severity of the sentence.” Kwon has an eight-day window to lodge an appeal following the receipt of a written copy of the court&#8217;s judgment.</p>
<p>Kwon&#8217;s sentencing comes after the former executive of Terraform Labs was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/do-kwon-to-be-released-on-e400000-bail-pleads-not-guilty-in-montenegro/">granted bail</a>, with a set amount of $435,000. Nevertheless, the Montenegrin High Court <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/terraform-labs-ceo-do-kwon-denied-bail-by-montenegrin-high-court-extradition-requests-loom/">unequivocally revoked</a> the lower court&#8217;s bail ruling on May 24, 2023. Marija Rakovic, a court spokeswoman, directly relayed this official information to Bloomberg.</p>

<p>So far, Kwon has been incarcerated in Montenegro for a cumulative period of 88 days. Unless he files an appeal against the verdict, it is anticipated that he will serve an additional 122 days in jail. Reports indicate that Montenegro&#8217;s prisons are <a href="https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/313615_MONTENEGRO-2021-HUMAN-RIGHTS-REPORT.pdf">overcrowded</a> and deemed <a href="https://www.refworld.org/docid/4da56da5c.html">distressing</a>. Meanwhile, both South Korea and the United States are actively pursuing the establishment of an extradition treaty with Montenegro, aiming to bring Kwon to face charges in their respective countries.</p>

The block generation time, averaging less than ten minutes, indicates that the difficulty is projected to climb by an estimated 2.1% to 2.33% based on the latest statistics. </strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Set for Fourth Increase</h2>
<p>In just eight days, the Bitcoin network is poised to readjust the difficulty encountered by miners, and once more, an increase is on the horizon. Over the course of three successive adjustments since May 18, 2023, the difficulty has swelled by 8.8%.</p>
<p>Currently standing at an unprecedented 52.35 trillion, the total difficulty has reached an all-time high (ATH). Coinciding with this milestone, the network&#x2019;s hashrate also hit a new ATH of <a href="https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/bitcoin/hashrate-chart">516.61 exahash</a> per second (EH/s) on June 11, at block height 793,868.</p>
<p>Throughout the past 2,016 blocks, the hashrate has maintained a steady average of 382.7 EH/s, while over the past 90 days, it settled at approximately 356.2 EH/s. Projections indicate that around June 27, the difficulty is set to experience an estimated boost of <a href="https://archive.ph/kT9T4">2.1%</a> to <a href="https://archive.ph/Tbvtk">2.33%</a>.</p>
<p>Notably, block intervals have been <a href="https://archive.ph/Ncu0q">noticeably shorter</a>, with the current data revealing generation times ranging from eight minutes and 52 seconds to nine minutes and 44 seconds. At this pace, uncovering the remaining 1,278 blocks guarantees an imminent increase in difficulty.</p>

<p>Over the past month, Foundry USA boasts a hashrate share of around 32.22% of the network&#x2019;s hashrate. Within the span of 30 days, Foundry managed to unearth 1,431 blocks out of a total of 4,442 mined. Recent three-day statistics indicate that Foundry&#x2019;s hashrate hovers around 103.60 EH/s. Following Foundry&#x2019;s lead, there&#x2019;s Antpool, F2pool, Viabtc, Binance Pool, and Luxor Tech, respectively, trailing behind.</p>
<p>Despite the current lower <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> prices and high difficulty, miners have displayed unwavering determination by continuing to bolster their efforts. Notably, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/new-study-highlights-bitmains-s19-mining-rigs-dominate-bitcoin-networks-hashrate/">research reveals</a> that mining participants are harnessing the industry&#x2019;s most high-performing application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) mining rigs available in the market.</p>

Price traded close to a one-week high on Monday, marginally below a key resistance level. Ethereum also rebounded, and is now hovering near a support point of its own.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>After dropping to a three-month low last week, bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) has since rebounded, trading close to a one-week high on Monday while seeing consolidation.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD hit an intraday peak of $26,675.93 to start the week, which is its strongest point since June 11.</p>
<p>The move pushed price close to a key resistance level of $26,800, which is typically the last line of defense before heading to $27,000.</p>

<p>In order to move beyond this point, a breakout will also need to occur on the relative strength index (RSI), in particular at a ceiling of 50.00.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 48.87, as traders begin to prepare for the potential of a break.</p>
<p>Should this occur, traders will likely be targeting the $27,300 level.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) started the week above $1,700, less than a week after almost falling below the $1,600 mark.</p>
<p>Following a low of $1,721.28 on Sunday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD hit an intraday high of $1,746.51 earlier today.</p>
<p>As a result of the move, the world&#x2019;s second largest cryptocurrency remains close to a one-week high of its own at $1,769.</p>

<p>From the chart, it appears that ethereum&#x2019;s RSI is at a reading of 41.48, which is marginally below a ceiling of 42.00.</p>
<p>Should this point of resistance be broken, it is likely that bulls could make another run towards the $1,800 region.</p>
