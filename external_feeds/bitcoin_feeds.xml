Kennedy Jr. (RFK Jr.) has warned of severe consequences of a nuclear war between the U.S. and Russia. In one estimate, more than five billion people could die from a war between the two nations, including around 99% of those in the U.S., Europe, Russia, and China.</strong></p>
<h2>RFK Jr on Potential US-Russia Nuclear War</h2>
<p>U.S. presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has raised concerns about the severe consequences of a nuclear war between the U.S. and Russia in a series of tweets. RFK Jr. is a son of former U.S. Attorney General and Senator Robert F. Kennedy and nephew of former U.S. President John F. Kennedy. The presidential hopeful wrote on Sunday:</p>
<blockquote><p>How would a nuclear war between the U.S. and Russia affect you?</p></blockquote>
<p>He also shared a video that outlines what the aftermath of a full-scale nuclear war between Russia and the U.S. could look like based on non-classified data. The video referenced a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-022-00573-0#Tab1">research paper</a> published in August last year, which estimates that more than five billion people could die from a war between the United States and Russia, including around 99% of those in the U.S., Europe, Russia, and China.</p>
<p>“We obviously don&#8217;t know how many people will survive a nuclear war but if it&#8217;s even remotely as bad as scientists think then it has no winners — merely losers,” the video notes.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">How would a nuclear war between the U.S. and Russia affect you? This video gives some idea. My comments below.<a href="https://t.co/wKUbUtAit2">https://t.co/wKUbUtAit2</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>“This is the future the Biden administration risks by escalating the war in Ukraine,” Kennedy asserted in a follow-up tweet.</p>
<p>Citing U.S. National Security Council official Fiona Hill and former Israeli PM Naftali Bennett, RFK Jr. stated that Ukraine and Russia agreed on the terms of a negotiated peace back in March last year. “Russia pledged to retreat to pre-invasion lines and Ukraine pledged not to join NATO in exchange for security guarantees from a number of Western countries,” Kennedy detailed. However, he noted: “Leaders from Washington and London arrived to scuttle the deal and prolong the war.”</p>
<p>Last month, Kennedy said President Joe Biden is &#8220;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kennedy-jr-says-biden-is-preparing-for-ground-war-with-russia-as-world-war-iii-warnings-escalate/">preparing for a ground war with Russia</a>&#8221; by signing the executive order to mobilize select reserve forces in order to augment Operation Atlantic Resolve. Some people believe that World War III is either already here or is coming. Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy secretary of Russia’s Security Council, recently <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-medvedev-natos-military-aid-ukraine-brings-world-war-three-closer-2023-07-11/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cautioned</a> that the increase in <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_217059.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">military assistance</a> to Ukraine by the NATO alliance brings World War III closer. The president of a New Delhi-based think tank said this week that he believes World War III has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indian-analyst-world-war-iii-already-started-brics-could-merge-with-sco/">already started</a>.</p>

This will result in hyperinflation, a spike in interest rates to compensate for the loss of purchasing power, and falling asset prices, further accelerating U.S. decline,” he described.</strong></p>
<h2>Analyst Says ‘Dollar Dominance May Be Coming to an End’</h2>
<p>Lowy Institute, an independent international policy think tank, published an opinion piece titled &#8220;De-dollarization: shifting power between the US and BRICS” on Aug. 3. The article is authored by Michael Roach, a management consultant and researcher for the institute.</p>
<p>“Will a new global reserve currency threaten the greenback’s supremacy? The short answer is yes,” Roach began. The analyst predicted:</p>
<blockquote><p>The dollar dominance may be coming to an end.</p></blockquote>
<p>He detailed that when Saudi Arabia and Russia signed a military cooperation agreement in 2021, the exclusive role of the U.S. as &#8220;the sole protector of the Saudi Kingdom” ceased to exist. In addition, he noted that at this year’s World Economic Forum in Davos, Saudi Arabia’s Finance Minister Mohammed Al-Jadaan announced that his country was open to trading in other currencies besides the U.S. dollar. Noting that this is “something they haven’t done in nearly 50 years,&#8221; he emphasized: “The signals of de-dollarisation were emerging.”</p>
<p>The analyst also mentioned that during the 2022 BRICS summit, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that the economic bloc was working to create an “international reserve currency.&#8221; There has been speculation that the BRICS nations&#8217; common currency will be <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/gofrom/most_popular/brics-bank-official-discusses-common-currency-as-reports-of-gold-backed-brics-currency-gain-attention">backed by gold</a>. However, Leslie Maasdorp, vice president and chief financial officer of the New Development Bank, also known as the BRICS Bank, said last month that the development of anything alternative to the U.S. dollar is &#8220;a medium to long-term ambition.&#8221; The BRICS nations are Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.</p>

<p>The Lowy Institute analyst also explained that central banks are already stockpiling gold reserves. Referencing the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves (COFER), he stressed: “Countries are positioning themselves for a new international system.”</p>
<p>While pointing out that de-dollarization is occurring, he said &#8220;it is not something unique.&#8221; Roach explained: &#8220;The rise and fall of empires and reserve currencies are apparent throughout history — from the Dutch Empire and the guilder to the British Empire and the pound sterling, and now the U.S. Empire and the dollar. There will inevitably be a shift in the world order, and it may well be the BRICS’ time,” he opined.</p>
<p>The analyst concluded:</p>
<blockquote><p>As the reliance on U.S. dollars diminishes, central banks will begin dumping their dollar reserves. This will result in hyperinflation, a spike in interest rates to compensate for the loss of purchasing power, and falling asset prices, further accelerating U.S. decline.</p></blockquote>

The raid came just days after the Kenyan government announced the suspension of Worldcoin&#8217;s activities in the country. </strong></p>
<h2>Officers Armed With Search Warrant</h2>
<p>The Kenyan police recently raided a building housing cryptocurrency and biometric ID project Worldcoin, and reportedly took away devices used for storing data. According to a local <a href="https://kahawatungu.com/police-raid-worldcoin-cryptocurrency-warehouse-in-nairobi-over-data/">report</a>, the law enforcement agents were not only armed with a search warrant but had the backing of so-called multi-agency officials.</p>
<p>The raid on Worldcoin’s Kenyan offices came barely a week after the government <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/kenyan-government-says-it-has-suspended-worldcoin-activities/">suspended</a> the cryptocurrency project on grounds that it posed a threat to public safety. Before that, Kenya’s data regulating agency had <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/kenyan-data-regulator-issues-warning-as-residents-rush-to-get-worldcoins-free-money/">sounded</a> the alarm over Worldcoin’s activities in the East African country.</p>
<p>However, following the move by the Kenyan government, Tools for Humanity (TFH)’s Alex Blania <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/worldcoin-confirms-kenya-id-verification-pause/">said</a> in a tweet that his organization would use the pause in Worldcoin’s activities to address regulators’ concerns. Yet, as stated in a report published by Kahawa Tungu, Data Commissioner Immaculate Kassait is adamant that Worldcoin did not adequately explain its intentions during its registration process, hence the raid.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Eliud Owalo: At the point of registration, Worldcoin  had met all the requisite requirements for registration purposes. What Kenyans need to understand is that there is a difference between registration and operationalization <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MondayReport?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MondayReport</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/TrevorOmbija?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@TrevorOmbija</a> <a href="https://t.co/bUxOEc7C0d">pic.twitter.com/bUxOEc7C0d</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>User Data &#8216;Will Not Be Infringed&#8217;</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, Eliud Owalo, the Kenyan ICT minister who has defended Worldcoin’s activities in the past, suggested in an interview with Citizen TV Kenya that TFH may not have been adhering to the requirements of its registration license. When asked about the fate of the data collected from over 350,000 Kenyans who had their irises scanned by Worldcoin&#8217;s &#8220;Orb,&#8221; Owalo said the Office of the Data Commissioner “has ensured that that data will not be infringed.”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>
<p>Reacting to news of the raid, Erik Voorhees, the founder of crypto exchange platform Shapeshift, lamented how the seizure of Worldcoin’s data storage devices has resulted in the transfer of users&#8217; personal data to politicians.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just like that, all the private data (which can never be revoked) is in the hands of politicians. And also whichever regime comes into power next. Of course, raiding the orbs isn’t even necessary. Governments of any country can just demand it all with a strongly worded letter,&#8221; Voorhees said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/ErikVoorhees/status/1688598672685121556?s=20">tweet</a>.</p>

Economists state that the uncertainty of the upcoming elections caused key bagholders to hedge their portfolios with foreign currency. However, analysts fear the effect this movement might have on retail prices.</strong></p>
<h2>Argentine Peso Bleeds as Investors Take Cover in U.S. Dollars</h2>
<p>The Argentine peso plunged to new historic lows Monday, less than a week before the PASO elections, in which parties elect their representatives for the October general ballotage. The Argentine fiat currency <a href="https://www.clarin.com/economia/escapa-dolar-blue-trepa-596-mercado-prepara-lunes-post-paso_0_nd2IiybBUw.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> 597 units per dollar on its free &#8220;blue&#8221; exchange rate, jumping 22 pesos in just one day.</p>
<p>This accelerated fall is said to be related to the uncertainty in the upcoming elections, with individuals and companies seeking to hedge their savings in foreign currency. Also, economic analysts say the next meeting with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which could result in a new official devaluation scheme, might play a part in this abnormal behavior.</p>
<p>Mateo Reschini, a research analyst for Inviu, <a href="https://www.perfil.com/noticias/bloomberg/bc-traders-ponen-fecha-a-devaluacion-argentina-mercado-sin-bozal.phtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The market takes note of the relevance of the date of the upcoming elections and decides to be covered against possible exchange rate jumps, hand in hand with statements from economists, the IMF statement, and media rumors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From July 7 to August 7, the Argentine peso lost 21% of its value against the U.S. dollar.</p>

<h2>Inflationary Ride</h2>
<p>This movement in the exchange rate is already wreaking havoc in retail stores, which have <a href="https://www.infobae.com/economia/2023/08/08/la-suba-del-dolar-trajo-remarcaciones-de-precios-y-elevo-el-piso-de-la-inflacion-para-agosto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rushed</a> to change prices and announce new pricing schemes for the next few days. Analysts fear that this could cause an acceleration of the inflation numbers, with some already expecting a 9%+ Consumer Price Index (CPI) for August.</p>
<p>Inflation numbers for July will be offered after the upcoming PASO elections, but consultants have <a href="https://www.bloomberglinea.com/latinoamerica/argentina/inflacion-julio-2023-que-es-el-ciclo-ganadero-y-como-afecto-al-precio-de-la-carne/#:~:text=Para%20julio%2C%20el%20%C3%ADndice%20se%20ubicar%C3%ADa%20por%20encima%20del%207%25.&amp;text=Desde%20el%20octavo%20mes%20del,con%20el%20aumento%20de%20agosto." target="_blank" rel="noopener">predicted</a> a 7.7% CPI, which would set the annual inflation rate at 114%, one of the highest in the world.</p>
<p>The country has tried to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/central-bank-of-argentina-reduces-dollar-and-yuan-disbursement-to-importers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduce</a> its disbursements to importers lately to control its dollar and yuan-based reserves, having to resort to using Chinese yuan to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/latam-insights-argentina-to-complete-imf-payment-with-chinese-yuan-bolivia-also-using-chinas-currency-for-international-settlements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complete</a> certain payments to the IMF. However, Economy minister and presidential candidate Sergio Massa reported the government reached a new <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/imf-agrees-release-7-5-162554598.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agreement</a> with the IMF, which would give the country an influx of at least $7.5 billion in the coming months.</p>

In spite of the existence of more than 26 million Paypal stablecoins, the contract continues to retain a substantial 92.91% of this supply. Concurrently, the Paxos Treasury wields control over 7.08% of all the PYUSD in circulation.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Paypal&#x2019;s PYUSD: Unpacking the Smart Contract, &#x2018;Freeze&#x2019; Function, and What It Means for Centralized Stablecoins</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Over a day has passed since Paypal and Paxos <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/payments-giant-paypal-launches-dollar-backed-stablecoin-pyusd/">announced</a> the new stablecoin PYUSD and unveiled the official <a href="https://github.com/paxosglobal/pyusd-contract">Github code repository</a> and <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x6c3ea9036406852006290770bedfcaba0e23a0e8">smart contract address</a>. Before the smart contract&#x2019;s publication, several bogus PYUSD tokens <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/paypals-new-stablecoin-sparks-confusion-wave-of-counterfeit-tokens-flood-decentralized-exchanges/">were created</a> and introduced to decentralized exchange (dex) platforms. Currently, the token contract reveals roughly <a href="https://archive.ph/gXuiN">26,905,005.66 PYUSD</a> in circulation across eight wallets.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The leading two holders possess <a href="https://archive.ph/sHI1G">99.99% of the supply</a>, indicating that PYUSD exists but has not yet been distributed. The initial mint occurred on August 3, 2023, five days prior, and PYUSD has experienced a total of 175 transfers, presumably internal tests. One <a href="https://twitter.com/Crypto_McKenna/status/1688634220044750848?s=20">topic of conversation</a> is Paypal&#x2019;s contract containing a &#x201C;freeze&#x201D; option, which has become a <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=paypal%20freeze&src=typed_query">trending subject</a> on social media platforms such as X (formerly Twitter).&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The <a href="https://github.com/paxosglobal/pyusd-contract/blob/master/contracts/PYUSDImplementation.sol">smart contract</a> features freeze and seizure (wipe) capabilities. The &#x201C;freeze&#x201D; function permits an appointed asset protection role to freeze a specific address; upon freezing, the address cannot transfer or receive tokens according to checks in transfer-related functions. The &#x201C;unfreeze&#x201D; function enables an assigned asset protection role to unfreeze a particular address, lifting any freeze-imposed limitations.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
A designated asset protection role can utilize the &#x201C;wipeFrozenAddress&#x201D; function to clear the balance of a frozen address, effectively confiscating its tokens. The tokens are deducted from the total supply while setting the frozen address balance to zero. Although freezing features are currently under discussion, other well-known stablecoins like <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>, USDC, and USDP also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/centre-obliges-government-request-freezes-address-with-100000-usdc/">possess</a> address-freezing <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/kucoin-hacked-for-150-million-in-bitcoin-bitfinex-and-tether-freeze-33-million-of-the-stolen-funds/">capabilities</a>.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Many dollar-pegged token providers argue that these functionalities assist in regulatory compliance management or responding to suspicious activities. Additionally, the PYUSD contract employs an outdated Solidity version 0.4.24. Like most popular stablecoin assets presently, PYUSD&#x2019;s contract can raise or lower the total token supply. Moreover, the PYUSD contract owner can also pause/unpause it, blocking transfers and approvals during a halted state.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The PYUSD smart contract shares similarities with today&#x2019;s notable centralized <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/top-stablecoins-see-steady-decline-over-past-month-as-dollar-pegged-token-economy-shrinks/">stablecoin assets</a> in terms of control and minting capabilities. It shouldn&#x2019;t be confused with decentralized stablecoin assets or censorship-resistant cryptocurrencies like <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a>. <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/paypals-latest-report-1-billion-in-crypto-assets-holdings-are-predominantly-btc-and-eth/">Paypal</a> enjoys a substantial position in the financial world, and while PYUSD doesn&#x2019;t pose a significant threat to decentralized and permissionless crypto assets, it could challenge centralized and regulated stablecoins.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />

These traders lucratively capitalized on early investments in esteemed blue-chip NFT collections such as Cryptopunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), and Art Blocks.</strong></p>
<h2>Navigating the NFT Gold Rush: Coingecko Uncovers Strategies of Top 15 Profitable Traders</h2>
<p>In its <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/top-nft-traders">latest NFT analysis</a>, Coingecko details that the top traders in the NFT arena have earned between $3.3 million and $101.6 million individually, cumulatively exceeding $300 million. The report explains the strategic investment choices and collections that have fueled the success of the foremost NFT traders.</p>
<p>Delving into the profits of the top 100 Ethereum NFT traders, Coingecko&#8217;s study discloses the most significant victors of the market thus far. This analysis focuses on traders&#8217; realized profits, meaning the tangible earnings secured through NFT sales. To qualify for this elite list of 100, traders were required to exhibit consistent activity over the past half-year and possession of no fewer than two collections.</p>
<p>The study illustrates that the leading NFT traders predominantly wagered on blue chip NFT collections at an early stage, an investment that has subsequently skyrocketed in value. Notably, Larva Labs&#8217; Cryptopunks constitute an astonishing 70.6% of total profits for the top 15, followed by Art Blocks&#8217; generative art at 12.2% and Bored Ape Yacht Club at 5.5%.</p>
<p>Occupying the zenith of the rankings, the NFT trader dubbed “Seths” boasts $101.6 million in realized gains to date. This vast fortune was cultivated across nine distinct addresses brimming with valuable Cryptopunks and other sought-after blue chip NFTs. Trailing in prestige, “Punks OTC” and “Mr.703” secure the next upper echelons with profits of around $29 million and $27 million, respectively.</p>
<p>Of the 15 top earners, 11 have extracted millions solely from Cryptopunks. For instance, trader 0x7eb2..3f6b clinched fifth place chiefly by selling one specific Cryptopunk to a renowned buyer. Conversely, some elite traders, such as Akira, directed their focus more towards Art Blocks.</p>
<p>Though these NFT moguls have reaped monumental wealth, the report underscores that this prosperity hinged substantially on early bets on the correct collections. Without astute identification of the upcoming blue chip collections, replicating such returns appears highly improbable. The study cautions average traders to diversify, to avoid losing opportunities in the few collections poised for explosive growth.</p>

The move came as cryptocurrencies rebounded, following a slow start to the week. Solana was another big mover, as it headed towards the $24.00 level.</strong></p>
<h2>Chainlink (LINK)</h2>
<p>Chainlink (LINK) was one of Tuesday’s biggest movers, as price surged by as much as 4% during the session.</p>
<p>LINK/USD hit an intraday peak of $7.42 earlier in the day, following a low of $7.00 to start the week.</p>
<p>Yesterday’s bottom was also a long-term support point, with bulls choosing to reject a breakout on this occasion.</p>
<p>This comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) continued to move away from a floor at the 48.00 mark.</p>
<p>As of writing, price strength is tracking at 52.20, close to a resistance zone of 53.00.</p>
<p>In the event this level is breached, there is a strong possibility that LINK could move towards $7.50.</p>
<h2>Solana (SOL)</h2>
<p>Solana (SOL) also made strong gains on Tuesday, with bulls pushing price towards the $24.00 level.</p>
<p>After starting the week at a low of $22.49, SOL/USD raced to an intraday peak of $23.68, earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Momentum seems to have shifted in favor of the bulls, with solana now trading at its highest point since last Wednesday.</p>
<p>This is now the third consecutive day that SOL has edged higher, resulting in the RSI nearing a collision with a ceiling at 53.00</p>
<p>Currently, price strength is tracking at 51.87, with a move to the aforementioned target likely to result in SOL moving above $24.00.</p>

A small group of prominent investors are wagering that bond prices will bounce back following the abrupt escalation in rates.</strong></p>
<h2>Hedge Funds Place Bold Wagers Against Treasuries Amid Soaring Yields</h2>
<p>Analysts at Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-07/goldman-jpmorgan-say-buy-treasuries-after-last-week-s-big-rout">contend</a> that the recent plunge in Treasuries has been excessive, urging investors to seize the opportunity to buy. Warren Buffett, unfazed by <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/white-house-yellen-slam-fitchs-us-rating-downgrade-biden-officials-call-it-bizarre-and-baseless/">Fitch&#8217;s downgrade</a> of U.S. debt, persists in <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a89fa03c-7c41-432d-9b67-fca6119c8018">purchasing</a> billions in Treasuries weekly for Berkshire Hathaway.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, billionaire investor Bill Ackman has unmasked a colossal <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4624664-bidenomics-set-for-showdown-with-bond-vigilantes-bill-ackman-places-monster-short-bond-bet">short position</a> against Treasuries, motivated by his anticipation of enduringly elevated inflation. The benchmark <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/TVC-US10Y/">10-year Treasury note&#8217;s yield</a> broke the 4% barrier last week, a movement inversely related to prices. This upswing trails the Federal Reserve&#8217;s assertive shift towards steep interest rate hikes aimed at quelling inflation.</p>

<p><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/india-poised-to-leapfrog-major-economies-becoming-worlds-second-largest-by-2075-goldman-sachs-report-predicts/">Goldman Sachs</a>&#8216; strategists argue that the confluence of supply dynamics and Fitch&#8217;s downgrade doesn&#8217;t warrant the spike in yields. They forecast a “tactical” recovery in Treasuries and endorse purchasing 30-year inflation-protected bonds subsequent to yields reaching an 11-year zenith.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-economists-discard-prior-recession-prediction-foresee-us-economic-resilience/">JPMorgan</a>, too, views the sell-off as exaggerated. Their analysts attribute the downturn to the liquidation of overpopulated long positions rather than fresh economic insights, expressing particular optimism about 5-year Treasuries.</p>
<p>Billionaire <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/billionaire-bill-ackman-on-us-banking-crisis-we-are-running-out-of-time-to-fix-this-problem/">Bill Ackman</a> caused a sensation last week, disclosing a substantial short bet against 30-year Treasuries. He foresees the yield on the 30-year bond surging to 5.5%, driven by forecasts of sustained higher inflation coupled with the corresponding risk premium.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I have been surprised how low US long-term rates have remained in light of structural changes that are likely to lead to higher levels of long-term inflation including de-globalization, higher defense costs, the energy transition, growing entitlements, and the greater bargaining…</p>
<p>&mdash; Bill Ackman (@BillAckman) <a href="https://twitter.com/BillAckman/status/1686906272937869312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 3, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Conversely, Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-buying-treasuries-regardless-112513557.html">persists</a> in acquiring Treasuries at a staggering $10 billion per week. Buffett brushes off apprehensions over Fitch&#8217;s U.S. debt downgrade, portraying Treasuries as a “no-brainer” investment, notwithstanding climbing yields.</p>
<p>The divergent wagers underscore the ongoing Wall Street debate regarding the potential longevity of the Treasury yield&#8217;s upsurge. Moreover, an inverted yield curve, where short-term rates have surpassed long-term yields, has intensified recession concerns.</p>
<p>This trend in bond markets is considered unusual and is often seen as a sign of an upcoming economic downturn, and it&#8217;s been this way for quite some time now. The inversion of the yield curve is a reliable indicator that has historically been followed by a recession in the following six to eighteen months.</p>

The company hopes the move will bridge the gap between fiat and cryptocurrencies for all of its stakeholders. Ethereum was marginally higher today.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) was back in the green on Tuesday, as the cryptocurrency made marginal gains during today&#x2019;s session.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The move came as Paypal announced its USD stablecoin, which will be hosted on the ethereum blockchain.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Following the news, CEO Dan Schulman said: &#x201C;Our commitment to responsible innovation and compliance, and our track record delivering new experiences to our customers, provides the foundation necessary to contribute to the growth of digital payments through Paypal USD.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD rose to a peak of $29,402.65 on the news, following a low of $28,724.14 the day prior.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Today&#x2019;s peak sees bitcoin trade at its highest point since last Wednesday, when it was last above $30,000.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Tuesday&#x2019;s rally has also brought the 10-day (red) moving average to the cusp of an upwards crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) rose marginally after the Paypal news, with price moving away from a recent support point.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Following a low of $1,804.72 to start the week, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD jumped to an intraday high of $1,836.06 on Tuesday.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Despite the slight rise in price, ethereum continues to trade below a recent resistance level of $1,850.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
A positive for bulls, however, comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) broke out of its ceiling at the 43.00 mark.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Currently, the index is tracking at a reading of 43.88, with the next resistance zone near the 50.00 point.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In the event this target is reached, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> will likely be back above $1,900.&#13;<br />

McHenry stated that if properly regulated, stablecoins &#8220;hold promise as a pillar of our 21st-century payments system,&#8221; calling on Congress to put clear rules on the sector by enacting stablecoin-specific regulation.</strong></p>
<h2>Representative McHenry States Stablecoins Might Become &#8216;Pillar&#8217; of Current Payment Systems</h2>
<p>U.S. Representative Patrick McHenry issued a statement on Monday, weighing in on the significance of the recent U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin launched by payments behemoth Paypal.</p>
<p>McHenry, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, viewed this development positively, stating that Paypal&#8217;s announcement was &#8220;a clear signal that stablecoins—if issued under a clear regulatory framework—hold promise as a pillar of our 21st-century payments system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Paypal <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/payments-giant-paypal-launches-dollar-backed-stablecoin-pyusd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the launch of an in-house managed stablecoin on Monday, dubbed &#8220;Paypal USD&#8221; (PYUSD). Paypal CEO Dan Schulman <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/payments-giant-paypal-launches-dollar-backed-stablecoin-pyusd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> the company&#8217;s vision was to integrate this stablecoin into its overall payments infrastructure.</p>
<p>McHenry also reinforced the need to bring clarity to the sector to grow the stablecoin industry in the country. He <a href="https://financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=408945" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clear regulations and robust consumer protections are essential to enabling stablecoins to achieve their full potential. That’s why it’s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Stablecoin Regulation Advances</h2>
<p>McHenry has been one of the supporters of bringing cryptocurrency and stablecoin-specific regulations to the U.S. In July, the House Financial Services Committee <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/4-crypto-bills-pass-us-house-committee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed</a> four cryptocurrency bills. The Clarity for Stablecoins Act, a stablecoin-specific bill, was among these, having been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-house-financial-services-committee-passes-stablecoin-legislation-after-a-few-fireworks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved</a> with bipartisan support.</p>
<p>McHenry also detailed that the Clarity for Stablecoins Act was built on top of the already existent crypto regimes that some states like New York have built, offering strong regulation to cryptocurrency companies.</p>
<p>Regulating digital assets and stablecoins is of significant importance for the U.S., McHenry detailed, declaring that the future of the leadership of the country in the digital asset industry was linked to the regulations. He concluded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are currently at a crossroads to keep America at the forefront of digital asset innovation. Congress is making significant, bipartisan progress on legislation to ensure the U.S. leads the financial system of the future. We must finish the job.</p>
