<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/cerebras-g42-100m-ai-supercomputer/">Cerebras Systems and G42 Join Forces in $100M AI Supercomputer Deal</a></p>
<p>Cerebras Systems, a Silicon Valley-based artificial intelligence (AI) company, has secured a strategic partnership with G42, a prominent technology group based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The deal will see the supply of three cutting-edge artificial intelligence supercomputers worth approximately $100 million. The collaboration comes as cloud computing providers around the globe seek other alternatives to cope with the high demand for AI computing solutions, with <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/nvidia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nvidia Corp</a>&#8216;s products facing shortages due to the immense popularity of services like ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Cerebras Condor Galaxy systems have garnered significant attention for their advanced capabilities, challenging Nvidia&#8217;s dominance in the AI computing market. G42 has committed to acquiring three of these systems, with plans to extend the collaboration further, potentially <a href="https://www.cerebras.net/press-release/cerebras-and-g42-unveil-worlds-largest-supercomputer-for-ai-training-with-4-exaflops-to-fuel-a-new-era-of-innovation" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">obtaining</a> up to nine additional units next year. The systems are constructed in the United States to speed up the deployment.  According to an announcement on July 20, the first AI supercomputer, known as Condor Galaxy 1 (CG-1), will be operational this year, while the remaining two, CG-2 and CG-3, are expected to go online by early 2024.</p>
<h2>Cerebras CEO to Relocate to the UAE for Three Months</h2>
<p>The $100 million deal begins as a strategic partnership between the two innovative entities. As part of this alliance, Cerebras CEO Andrew Feldman has disclosed his intention to relocate to the UAE for three months. During this period, Cerebras CEO will closely collaborate with G42 to further develop their computing service using revolutionary AI systems. Feldman envisions this as a rare opportunity to transform the market by creating cutting-edge AI computing solutions for various sectors.</p>
<p>Based in Abu Dhabi, G42 is a tech conglomerate with nine operating companies specializing in data center and cloud service businesses. With the acquisition of Cerebras&#8217;s AI supercomputers, the company aims to offer advanced AI computing services to industries like healthcare and energy, revolutionizing how these sectors leverage AI technologies.</p>
<p>The collaboration between the two companies represents a powerful combination of expertise and resources, with G42 securing significant backing of $800 million from US tech investment firm Silver Lake, which is strongly supported by the UAE&#8217;s sovereign wealth fund, Mudabala.</p>
<h2>&#8216;White Glove&#8217; Service for Success</h2>
<p>Cerebras&#8217;s unique &#8220;white glove&#8221; service has been pivotal in fostering the new alliance. G42 Cloud CEO Talal AlKaissi praised the company for its seamless support in building AI systems on their machines, making the collaboration a smooth and efficient process. He hinted at the possibility of utilizing the excess capacity to offer AI solutions to open-source AI communities worldwide, with a focus on the vibrant US ecosystem.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cerebras has what they call a &#8216;white glove&#8217; service that makes it easy for us to build AI systems on its machines. There will be some excess capacity that we hope to wholesale with Cerebras to customers in the open-source AI community from many places around the world, especially in the US ecosystem,&#8221; AlKaissi told Reuters.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/gamers-blockchain-games/">Professional Gamers Ready to Explore Blockchain-Based Games</a></p>
<p>Blockchain technology in gaming appears to be gaining traction among gamers who take part in gaming tournaments for a living. This comes despite resistance from some game developers. Gaimin Gladiators&#8217; professional Dota 2 player Erik “Tofu” Engel <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/web3-blockchain-dota-2-rocket-league-pros-want-to-explore-web3-and-blockchain-gaming" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">expressed his thoughts</a> on Web3 in gaming and how it can help gamers. The gamer, who has won over $400,000 in major tournaments in the Dota 2 competitive gaming scene, is happy to see game developers make “more out of games than just games.”</p>
<p>“The idea of blockchain gaming is still a new and expanding topic for most of us, and it’s something I want to explore more in the future. If it’ll improve gaming and make it even more rewarding, then that’s definitely something to look out for in times ahead,” he said.</p>
<p>Engel went on to express that Web3 has features that &#8220;feel beneficial to the player” and that he looks forward to seeing what gaming companies do next.</p>
<p>Another professional gamer, Max &#8220;Maxeew&#8221; Ng lauded the integration of the new technology into gaming, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The idea behind adding new technology and features is something that pretty much any game can benefit from, especially when it is something that can reward the users’ time and expenditure on the game itself.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The gamer added that he has looked into blockchain games and will try them out after the current gaming season.</p>
<p>Gaimin Gladiators co-founder Joseph Turner also weighed in, noting that the emergence of blockchain-based games “spooked many major publishers”.</p>
<p>Game developers sought to distance themselves from the trend. For instance, in 2021, the developer of popular video games Dota 2 and Half-Life – Valve Corporation – removed blockchain-based games from its Steam gaming marketplace. The firm went on to revise its guidelines and ban games that issue cryptocurrencies or <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFTs</a>.</p>
<p>Turner believes that the “extremely traditional” gaming company&#8217;s stance on blockchain-based games was likely to change over time. He urged blockchain projects to go beyond blockchain integration into games and directly engage the competitive gaming industry.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Walter Lee, BNB Chain&#8217;s growth partner and GameFi lead, believes that Web3 and blockchain technology have the potential to empower traditional gaming ecosystems. He cited use cases such as the tokenization of in-game assets and on-chain verifiable random number generation.</p>
<p>Lee pointed out that Web3 offers many opportunities for professional gamers such as the ability to develop their brand and generate income in decentralised finance.</p>
<p>“There is a surge of many interesting upcoming games from various new studios. Some of these titles may potentially gain massive popularity and generate new exciting esports leagues for the industry [&#8230;] Players will be able to sustain and build in the industry with lesser reliance on an esports firm; this balances the demand between esports firms and players,” he said.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-doj-bankman-fried-ellison-diary/">US DoJ Accuses Sam Bankman-Fried of Leaking Ellison&#8217;s Diary to Press</a></p>
<p>The United States Department of Justice (DoJ) has accused disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried of leaking the private diary of former colleague Caroline Ellison to the New York Times.</p>
<p>Yesterday, The New York Times <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ceo-caroline-ellison-alameda-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> an article delving into the personal writings of Ellison, whom they refer to as a crucial witness in the upcoming trial of Bankman-Fried. Before the downfall of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ftx-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a>, Ellison was in charge of Alameda Research, a sister trading firm, and had a romantic relationship with Bankman-Fried on various occasions. A month after FTX&#8217;s collapse Ellison pleaded guilty to federal charges in December 2022.</p>
<p>Later yesterday, the DoJ submitted its filing <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940.176.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noting</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The defendant’s purpose in sharing these materials is plain. Ellison has pleaded guilty to a cooperation agreement and is expected to testify at trial that she agreed with the defendant to defraud FTX’s customers and investors, and Alameda’s lenders.”</p></blockquote>
<p>It further continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>“By selectively sharing certain private documents with the New York Times, the defendant is attempting to discredit a witness, cast Ellison in a poor light, and advance his defense through the press and outside the constraints of the courtroom and rules of evidence: that Ellison was a jilted lover who perpetrated these crimes alone.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Also, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has formally requested Judge Lewis A. Kaplan to implement an order that restricts extrajudicial statements from both parties and witnesses, aiming to safeguard a fair trial conducted by an impartial jury.</p>
<p>The DOJ highlighted that deliberate leaks intended to discredit witnesses not only run the risk of prejudicing the jury pool but may also deter other witnesses from coming forward to testify.</p>
<h2>FTX Sues SBF and Allies</h2>
<p>In another development, crypto trading platform FTX has sued Sam Bankman-Fried and his close allies to recover $1 billion in questionable transactions. The recent lawsuit is part of the efforts by FTX to revive the exchange, under the leadership of new CEO John Ray.</p>
<p>The lawsuit targets Bankman-Fried, Gary Wang (FTX co-founder and former chief technology officer), Nishad Singh (former director of engineering), and Caroline Ellison (co-chief executive of Alameda Research LLC, a significant FTX unit). All of them face accusations of doing dishonest transfers that personally benefited them but didn&#8217;t benefit FTX.</p>
<p>For example, the complaint alleges that Bankman-Fried and Wang took $546 million from Alameda in May 2022 to buy shares in Robinhood Markets Inc. They provided Alameda with fake loans that didn&#8217;t require any collateral and had lower interest rates than what the market offered. The only person who authorized these loans for Alameda was Ellison, according to the lawsuit.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Bankman-Fried, Wang, and Singh also face accusations of using fake loans to acquire FTX stock worth $250 million at that time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/north-korean-hackers-attack-jumpcloud/">North Korean Hackers Attack American IT Company JumpCloud</a></p>
<p>A North Korean group of hackers has been identified to be responsible for a recent security breach at American IT management company JumpCloud. According to cybersecurity experts, the attack may be an attempt by the hackers to gain access to multiple potential victims all at once.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://jumpcloud.com/blog/security-update-incident-details" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a> by JumpCloud, the firm confirmed that the attack took place on June 27. It also further clarified that the hackers targeted less than 5 of its clients, using its access. And though JumpCloud did not disclose the exact customers that were affected by the attack, there might be reasons to believe that it was about no more than mere crypto theft. That is according to sources who are closely familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, cybersecurity firms CrowdStrike Holding and Mandiant have also weighed in on the attack.  CrowdStrike confirms that the hack was carried out by the &#8220;Labyrinth Chollima&#8221; group. Whereas, Mandiant also confirmed initial suspicions that the group may be working on behalf of North Korea. According to Mandiant,  the hackers responsible worked for North Korea&#8217;s Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB). That is the country&#8217;s primary foreign intelligence agency.</p>
<h2>JumpCloud Hack: Latest Development in North Korean Cyber Crimes and Crypto Theft</h2>
<p>It is worth noting that the JumpCloud hack is not the first time that North Korea will be linked with such bad acts. However, the latest hack appears to be signaling that North Korean hackers are gradually improvising.</p>
<p>For context, they seem to now be targeting companies that can give them broader access to multiple victims, rather than their old way of going after individual crypto firms. Technically, that is a term known as the &#8220;supply chain attack&#8221;.</p>
<p>But despite the various allegations against North Korea, particularly as it pertains to organizing crypto heists, the country has continued to deny its involvement.</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth though, blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis said last year that North Korean hackers stole about $1.7 billion worth of digital assets over multiple hacks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/indonesia-national-crypto-exchange/">Indonesia Unveils National Crypto Exchange and Clearing House</a></p>
<p>Indonesia, one of the world&#8217;s most populous countries, has officially joined the ranks of nations with a national crypto exchange and clearing house. After overcoming challenges and delays, the Commodity Futures Trading Supervisory Agency (Bappebti) <a href="https://bappebti.go.id/siaran_pers/detail/12795" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> on July 20 the successful launch of the long-awaited exchange, marking a significant milestone in the country&#8217;s crypto journey.</p>
<p>With this exchange, the Southeast Asian country aims to provide a regulated and legitimate platform for digital asset trading within its borders to boost investor confidence, promote financial inclusion, and enhance crypto transactions&#8217; overall transparency and security. The newly introduced digital asset trading platform will be an exclusive venue for legally conducting crypto trades within the country.</p>
<p>Accompanying the platform, Bappebti has also introduced a state-of-the-art futures clearing house, an essential component that facilitates smooth and secure transactions between buyers and sellers. This addition is expected to bolster the country&#8217;s overall crypto ecosystem, offering a higher level of protection and reliability for market participants.</p>
<h2>Interest in Cryptocurrencies Continues to Surge in Indonesia Despite Ban on Crypto Payments</h2>
<p>Indonesia began its journey to establish a national crypto exchange in 2021. However, due to the meticulous review process of potential participants, the launch, initially <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/indonesia-crypto-stock-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planned</a> for the end of 2022, was delayed until July 2023. The Trade Minister of Indonesia, Zulkifli Hasan, revealed that licensed traders in Indonesia can now join the national exchange within a specified window, enabling them to participate actively in the country&#8217;s growing crypto market.</p>
<p>Last year, Indonesia&#8217;s deputy minister of trade, Jerry Sambuaga, proposed policy changes in response to the growing interest in digital assets. One of the proposals required two-thirds of the directors and commissioners of crypto firms to be Indonesian citizens.</p>
<p>Despite the ban on using cryptocurrencies for payment, Indonesia&#8217;s interest in digital assets has surged, especially during the pandemic. Bappebti&#8217;s data revealed that nearly 11 million people, approximately 4% of the country&#8217;s population, have invested in cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>The newly launched exchange and clearing house will provide vital transaction records and enhanced protection for crypto investors in Indonesia. It also marks a significant step in monitoring the rapidly growing sector amid the ongoing transition in regulatory oversight. While the country prohibits using cryptocurrencies as a means of payment, it permits investments in these assets, leading to a surge in investments during the pandemic.</p>
<h2>Binance Indonesia Arm Tokocrypto Registered with the National Exchange</h2>
<p>According to the Bappebti announcement, renowned licensed crypto companies, including Tokocrypto, an Indonesian digital asset trading platform acquired by <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> in December 2022, and Indodax, are among the prominent traders on the exchange. Day-to-day operations of the national crypto platform will be managed by PT Bursa Komoditi Nusantara, ensuring adherence to regulatory standards and efficient functioning. PT Kliring Berjangka Indonesia will oversee clearing transactions, providing a seamless and reliable trading process.</p>
<p>With the passing of a new law earlier this year, the Financial Services Authority will gradually take over the regulation, supervision, and oversight of cryptocurrencies from Bappebti over a two-year transition period. The move reflects Indonesia&#8217;s commitment to fostering a robust and secure crypto market for its investors.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/canadian-crypto-investor-home-robberies/">Canadian Police Warns Public on Crypto Investors&#8217; Home Robberies</a></p>
<p>In recent times, high-value crypto investors in Canada have become victims of home robberies, prompting the local police to issue a public warning.</p>
<p>Both the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in Richmond and Delta Police have <a href="https://bc-cb.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/ViewPage.action?languageId=1&amp;siteNodeId=2122&amp;contentId=80507" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expressed</a> their concern over the emerging pattern of these attacks and are urging potential victims to come forward and report any incidents to aid in their ongoing investigations.</p>
<p>The Canadian Police noted that several incidents have been reported within the past year, where armed assailants have targeted investors’ homes, seeking to steal their digital fortunes. The sheer audacity and sophistication of these crimes have raised serious concerns within the law enforcement community.</p>
<p>Over the past year, Richmond and Delta police have been alarmed by a series of robberies targeting individuals known to be high-value crypto investors. The attackers seem to have detailed knowledge about the victims’ crypto investments, their residential addresses, and the best time to strike.</p>
<p>With this information at hand, the criminals employ tactics to gain access to their victims&#8217; homes, posing as delivery personnel or authoritative figures. Once inside, the suspects proceeded to rob the victims of information that provides access to their cryptocurrency accounts.</p>
<p>The investigations reveal that these robberies have netted significant amounts of digital currency gains, but the specific figures have not been disclosed by the authorities.</p>
<p>One encouraging development is that an arrest has already been made in connection with one of the reported incidents, and charges are being recommended. While the authorities have not confirmed a direct link between all the cases, they have identified a discernable pattern that the criminals seem to follow in executing these home robberies.</p>
<h2>A Call to Action</h2>
<p>The recent wave of home invasion-style robberies targeting high-value cryptocurrency investors in Richmond and Delta has raised major worries about the crypto community&#8217;s safety and security. With ongoing investigations and collaboration between the Richmond RCMP and Delta Police, there is hope that the perpetrators of these crimes will be brought to justice.</p>
<p>In the meantime, crypto investors are urged to take precautions to protect themselves and their assets. The police department has advised residents to refrain from letting strangers or delivery personnel into their homes, regardless of how legitimate they may appear. Instead, residents are encouraged to request deliveries be left outside and to be cautious when dealing with unknown individuals at their doorstep.</p>
<p>Additionally, the department recommended that investors should discuss financial matters only with individuals they trust and avoid sharing sensitive financial information in public places, where eavesdropping is possible.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the crypto regulatory landscape in Canada appears to have become stringent as a host of crypto exchanges are exiting the territory. Dubai-based crypto exchange Bybit recently <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bybit-exit-canada-regulatory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> its exit from Canada due to recent regulatory developments in the North American nation. Bybit’s departure from Canada follows shortly after leading crypto exchange <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> made a similar announcement.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/aviation-digital-yuan-ticket/">China’s Aviation Authority Approves Digital Yuan for Ticket Purchases</a></p>

<p>China&#8217;s Civil Aviation Administration (CAAC) has officially <a href="http://www.caacnews.com.cn/2/2/202307/t20230718_1368969.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">approved</a> the digital yuan for purchasing air tickets. The company issued a notice on July 18, 2023, via a blog post.</p>
<p>Spring Airlines was the first aviation company to <a href="https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202104/16/WS60794328a31024ad0bab6188.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">allow payments</a> for its ticket with the digital yuan in 2021. The carrier received 560 yuan for a flight ticket from Shanghai to Shenzhen. Xiamen Airlines soon followed suit in November of the same year. Afterward, Beijing Daxing International Airport and Beijing Capital International Airport also unveiled a digital yuan initiative in 2022. However, widespread use of the asset in the aviation sector did not follow.</p>
<h2>Partnership for Air Tickets</h2>
<p>With the new development, the CAAC is partnering with the China Merchants Bank (CMB) to launch a digital yuan payment platform. The platform is known as the Civil Aviation Ticket Government Procurement Management Platform Application Digital RMB Settlement Mode. While both parties have partnered on multiple projects in the past, this new project will allow digital currency to be used to settle business air tickets. Likewise, passengers can also use the CBDC to access novel services via the platform.</p>
<p>Additionally, the platform brings a new service experience to business passengers and is expected to boost the digital economy. Before the launch, the company noted that it completed the functional testing of the air ticket procurement service system. It also tested the China Merchants Bank’s clearing system. </p>
<h2>Digital Yuan Tests Continue Across Sectors</h2>
<p>China has made significant progress in the development of a CBDC. The PBOC has been testing the digital renminbi across the nation since 2020. Its first major <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/315000-worth-digital-yuan-olympics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deployment</a> of the asset was for the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. Since then, the bank has been conducting pilot tests across different cities.</p>
<p>The bank has also encouraged the use of digital yuan in the transportation sector. Railway stations, light rail connections, and metro systems have been upgraded around the nation to facilitate smooth transactions with the digital yuan. Elsewhere, the bank partnered with <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/china-offline-payment-digital-yuan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">China Telecom and China Unicom</a> to allow offline transactions for the digital yuan via SIM cards. The plan would also allow users to pay for goods and services using the digital yuan, even without a bank account or an Internet connection.</p>
<p>The adoption of the digital yuan by the CAAC is expected to boost the development and innovation of the digital economy in the nation. It should also augment the competitiveness and influence of China&#8217;s aviation sector in the global market.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/trump-man-on-the-moon-nft-nasa/">Melania Trump&#8217;s &#8216;Man on the Moon&#8217; NFT Drop at Odds with NASA Regulations</a></p>
<p>Former United States First Lady Melania Trump’s latest <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFT</a> drop “Man on the Moon” has been met with pushback as it appears to be in violation of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) merchandising regulations. The limited edition collectible was released on Wednesday, one day before the 54th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission, and features a July 21, 1969 image of astronaut Buzz Aldrin on the moon. The image was captured by fellow astronaut Neil Armstrong who is seen as a reflection in Aldrin’s visor.</p>
<p>The $75 collectible places the iconic image in a silver frame with a textured surface that appears to be inspired by the moon’s surface. The bottom of the frame sports a three-dimensional model of the moon while the back features the disembodied text “One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind”. It also includes an embedded audio file that will be &#8220;unlocked&#8221; upon purchase.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

I salute America’s ingenuity and ongoing commitment towards excellence. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/USAmemorabilia?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#USAmemorabilia</a> <a href="https://t.co/Kr7hJUC63w">pic.twitter.com/Kr7hJUC63w</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p></blockquote>
<p>NASA’s <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/features/Merchandising_Guidelines.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Regulations on Merchandising Requests and Media Usage Guidelines</a> strictly prohibit the use of its intellectual property in NFT. While images that are produced by the agency and in the public domain – like the Buzz Aldrin image – can be used freely, NASA reserves the right to approve or deny requests for their use on merchandise. The regulations state that the agency “does not wish for its images to be used in connection with NFTs” and is &#8220;not approving any merchandising applications&#8221; related to NFTs.</p>
<p>The drop was done in partnership with USA Memorabilia, the “premiere NFT platform featuring United States memorabilia”. It appears that the former first lady and the NFT platform did not consult with the federal agency, hence the conflict.</p>
<p>The drop has sparked conversation online as members of the NFT and crypto community wait to see how the agency will respond. It is unclear if NASA will take legal action against Trump. A NASA attorney is reported to have previously told <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-07-19/nasa-logo-shirts-swimsuits-everything" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">The Los Angeles Times</a> that while the agency can send cease-and-desist letters to merchants who overstep its guidelines, it prefers less confrontational means including informal conversations.</p>
<p>Melania Trump, like her husband former US President <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a>, has been an active participant in the NFT space in recent weeks. Last month the former first lady debuted a line of collectibles commemorating pivotal moments in American history with a collection titled the “1776 Collection”.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/opensea-trading-feature-deals/">OpenSea Announces New Trading Feature Dubbed Deals</a></p>
<p>The NFT trading community on OpenSea now will have a new feature to enable P2P trading dubbed Deals. With the new trading feature, the OpenSea NFT trading community can offer a combo of digital artworks and sweeten the deal with Wrapped Ethers (WETH). The NFT marketplace announced that users no longer need to use sketchy DMs and websites to trade their digital artworks since OpenSea Deals provides a seamless platform.</p>
<p>Notably, the OpenSea Deals feature is powered by the Seaport protocol, which was introduced earlier last year. The Seaport protocol is a web3 marketplace project backed by OpenSea that is used for safely and efficiently buying and selling <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFTs</a>. Moreover, the Seaport protocol uses open-source core smart contracts, which entail different items including <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ETH</a>, ERC20, ERC721,  and ERC1155.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Introducing Deals: offer your NFTs for theirs, securely on OpenSea.</p>
<p>👉 <a href="https://t.co/bTciJLUWDK">https://t.co/bTciJLUWDK</a> <a href="https://t.co/KR2MLbi7jh">pic.twitter.com/KR2MLbi7jh</a></p>
<p>&mdash; OpenSea (@opensea) <a href="https://twitter.com/opensea/status/1682077991029932032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 20, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>With the Make a Deal OpenSea feature, users can offer one or more of their NFTs in return for another user’s NFTs. However, the user must first have a wallet address, and an ENS name or basically an OpenSea username for the person intended to make a deal with.</p>
<p>“Similar to Offers, the user accepting the Deal will pay gas. At this time, Deals transactions won’t include the OpenSea fee or any creator earnings. ERC-721 NFTs from badged collections that are visible in a user’s profile (not hidden) are eligible for Deals,” OpenSea <a href="https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/articles/18477733878803?_gl=1%2Aotc1ih%2A_ga%2AMzUyMzMwNDc1LjE2ODk5MTg4Mzk.%2A_ga_9VSBF2K4BX%2AMTY4OTkxODgzOS4xLjEuMTY4OTkyMDUxOC4wLjAuMA.." target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">noted</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, OpenSea has been criticized for not being friendly to the community during the crypto bear market. According to Twitter user Aaron (@Aaronsage), the crypto industry currently needs value and not innovation. The Twitter user suggested that OpenSea could have easily launched a crypto token to give back to the community instead of announcing a trading platform since most people are holding their bags in anticipation of future bull rallies.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">&#8211; Disabling Creator Royalties<br />&#8211; OpenSea Pro<br />&#8211; NFT Trading</p>
<p>All things that this space doesn&#39;t CURRENTLY NEED</p>
<p>Yet, the braindead OpenSea team implemented them</p>
<p>&mdash; Aaron (@AaronSage) <a href="https://twitter.com/AaronSage/status/1682138205720829952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 20, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>OpenSea and Its Market Position</h2>
<p>The OpnSea NFT marketplace has enjoyed significant dominance in the digital artwork industry since its official Launch a few years ago. For instance, OpenSea collected revenue of about $600 million in 2022 despite the cryptocurrency industry battling the bear market effects. Nonetheless, the NFT trading volume has significantly declined as more traders recently moved to more promising digital assets like meme coins.</p>
<p>Consequently, OpenSea has been forced to continue innovating in a bid to remain on top of the NFT marketplace competition.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the rising use of NFTs in different industries including the luxury sector to eliminate counterfeit products has given OpenSea huge growth prospects. Furthermore, the use of phygital by different blockchains including Shiba Inu, and VeChain has increased the overall NFT traded volume. Additionally, the exponential growth of the metaverse and GameFi industry has given the NFT market more utility away from mere speculation.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-attorneys/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-attorneys/">Sam Bankman-Fried Faces Legal Action from FTX Attorneys</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/sam-bankman-fried/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>, the former CEO of the now-defunct <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ftx-exchange/">FTX</a> crypto exchange is embroiled in a legal battle with his former company’s lawyers.</p>
<p>The attorneys have <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/20/sam-bankman-fried-is-paying-defense-lawyers-with-ftx-funds-lawsuit.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reportedly</a> filed a lawsuit in Delaware bankruptcy court, accusing Bankman-Fried and members of his leadership team of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars from FTX and its sister hedge fund, Alameda Research.</p>
<h2>The $10 Million Gift Scandal</h2>
<p>The focal point of the legal battle lies in a transaction involving a substantial $10 million gift to Sam Bankman-Fried’s father, Joe Bankman. While gifting money to family members is not unlawful, this significant transaction, which allegedly occurred around January 2022 has sparked concerns.</p>
<p>FTX attorneys contend that the $10 million gift was essentially a ruse to divert company funds into the personal coffers of the former CEO’s family. The complaint contends that these funds are now being used to pay for Bankman-Fried’s criminal defense expenses, suggesting potential links to criminal activities related to the alleged misappropriation of funds.</p>
<p>In light of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ftx-exchange-files-for-bankruptcy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX&#8217;s bankruptcy</a>, the lawyers for the exchange are determined to recover as much money as possible for the company&#8217;s creditors and investors. The allegations of embezzlement against Bankman-Fried and his leadership team are central to this mission.</p>
<p>Despite mounting questions, a representative for Bankman-Fried has opted not to comment on the matter, leaving stakeholders and the crypto community searching for answers. Should the court find them guilty of these financial misdeeds, they may be ordered to repay the misappropriated funds, along with facing potential fines and penalties.</p>
<h2>The Rise and Fall of FTX</h2>
<p>FTX, founded in 2019 by Sam Bankman-Fried and Gary Wang, quickly gained recognition as a pioneering crypto exchange. Bankman-Fried’s background in quantitative trading and his reputation as a savvy crypto investor played a significant role in propelling FTX to prominence.</p>
<p>The exchange stood out for its diverse offerings, including perpetual futures contracts, options trading, and other innovative financial products. FTX&#8217;s successful partnerships with renowned sports teams, celebrities, and institutions further solidified its position in the competitive crypto market.</p>
<p>However, the exchange’s success was short-lived, as liquidity dried up and customer withdrawal demands exceeded the company’s capacity. These financial difficulties became insurmountable, prompting FTX to declare bankruptcy late last year.</p>
<p>Sam Bankman-Fried faces a slew of criminal allegations, including fraud, bribery, and campaign finance offenses. The allegations point to possible corporate wrongdoing, with Bankman-Fried reportedly engaging in acts that contributed to FTX’s financial instability.</p>
<p>Alongside Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX and Alameda executives Caroline Ellison, Gary Wang, and Nishad Singh are also named as co-defendants in the case. Meanwhile, Bankman-Fried has maintained his innocence throughout the legal proceedings and pleaded not guilty to all charges.</p>
<p>As the trial is expected to <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-criminal-charges-ftx-sbf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commence later this year</a>, the industry will closely monitor the evidence presented and the arguments put forth by both the prosecution and the defense.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coinbase-shut-down-crypto-lending/" rel="prev">next</a></p>
