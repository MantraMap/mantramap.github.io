<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Reddit&#8217;s tokens Moons (MOON) and Bricks (BRICK) see volatility amid platform changes.</em></li>



<li><em>Speculation of a potential Kraken listing boosts MOON&#8217;s value, while Reddit&#8217;s terms update impacts BRICK&#8217;s price.</em></li>



<li><em>The social network aims for simplicity, removing certain bonuses while retaining verified virtual goods.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Moons (MOON) and Bricks (BRICK), the native tokens of Reddit&#8217;s r/CryptoCurrency and r/Fortnite subreddits respectively, have experienced significant volatility following recent changes in Reddit&#8217;s product orientation. While Moons witnessed a surge in value, fueled by speculation about potential listing on the cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://coincu.com/199312-kraken-requested-irs-for-customer-information/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kraken</a>, the excitement was partially misplaced.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1186-1024x684.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="684" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1186-1024x684.png" alt="Reddit Community Tokens Skyrocket Over 300% In Just Two Days" class="wp-image-203623" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1186-1024x684.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1186-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1186-768x513.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1186-750x501.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1186-1140x761.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1186.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Reddit Community Tokens Skyrocket Over 300% In Just Two Days 1"></a></figure></div>


<p>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/151a5t2/the_reddit_tos_has_been_changed_and_verified" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">change</a> in Reddit&#8217;s policy regarding the distribution of reward points was revealed through a tweet by the unofficial Twitter account dedicated to r/CryptoCurrency Moons. According to the <a href="https://twitter.com/unofficalMoons/status/1680551451385364482" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweet</a>, Coins, and Rewards, two bonus mechanisms in the Web2 format, will be removed, while the platform will retain <a href="https://coincu.com/136796-reddits-collectible-nft-avatars/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Collectible Avatars</a> and Community Points mechanics. This alteration aims to simplify the platform&#8217;s structure, and further details regarding the new direction for awarding will be announced in the coming months.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to note that the concept of community points, pioneered by Reddit admins through tokens like Moons and Bricks, falls under the category of verified virtual goods, along with Reddit&#8217;s collectible avatars. On the other hand, Reddit coins and awards are considered virtual goods and are set to disappear.</p>



<p>The tweet highlighting these changes refers to an archived copy of the platform&#8217;s terms of use page, indicating that the news itself is several months old. Nonetheless, the information sparked a surge in MOON&#8217;s price, which rose by 270% to over $0.34, as tracked by TradingView. Currently, MOON is listed on exchanges such as SushiSwap, Gate.io, and MEXC.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1184-1024x624.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="624" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1184-1024x624.png" alt="Reddit Community Tokens Skyrocket Over 300% In Just Two Days" class="wp-image-203620" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1184-1024x624.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1184-300x183.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1184-768x468.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1184-1536x935.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1184-2048x1247.png 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1184-750x457.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1184-1140x694.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Reddit Community Tokens Skyrocket Over 300% In Just Two Days 2"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">MOON price chart. <em>Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Similarly, Bricks, the token rewarded for contributions in the r/Fortnite subreddit, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/brick" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">experienced</a> a significant increase in value, surging by 360% in just two days. The reasons behind this surge are linked to the speculation surrounding impending changes on the social network.</p>



<p>Coingecko&#8217;s co-founder and COO, Bobby Ong, acknowledged the impact of the speculation on these tokens&#8217; prices. Ong also suggested that this phenomenon reflects a new trend among social networks in reallocating value to users. His tweet expressed confidence in the future, where social networks will find innovative ways to redistribute value to contributors. Ong mentioned that he himself holds Moon and Brick archives but only for testing purposes.</p>



<p>While the potential listing of Moons on Kraken was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/151a5t2/comment/js8fkkt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hinted</a> at by a member of Kraken&#8217;s support team, it should be noted that Moons are currently supported by a limited number of exchanges, including MEXC, Gate.io, SushiSwap, and RCP Swap. If Kraken were to list Moons, it could bring significant changes to the token&#8217;s trading landscape. Users on the r/CryptoCurrency subreddit humorously speculated that they would adopt Kraken as their exchange of choice. The support team member, named Bill, directed people to a form for filing coin listing requests.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://coincu.com/194304-reddit-crypto-communities/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a> continues to navigate changes in its product orientation, the volatility of Moons and Bricks demonstrates the impact these alterations have on the value and trading activity of community tokens. The future of Reddit&#8217;s awarding system remains uncertain, but the recent developments highlight the evolving landscape of social networks and their efforts to provide value to their user communities.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Shinhan Bank, SCB TechX, and a major financial institution in Taiwan have completed a successful proof-of-concept pilot for stablecoin remittance on the Hedera open-source network.</em></li>



<li><em>The pilot achieved real-time settlement and foreign exchange rate integration across multiple currencies, showcasing the potential for efficient cross-border payments.</em></li>



<li><em>The use of stablecoins offers a low-cost and reliable method for transferring value across borders, increasing financial inclusion and accessibility for underserved communities.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Shinhan Bank, SCB TechX, and a major financial institution in Taiwan have <a href="https://hedera.com/blog/shinhan-bank-scb-techx-successfully-pilot-stablecoin-remittances-on-the-hedera-network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the successful completion of a proof-of-concept (PoC) pilot for stablecoin remittance. This pilot was conducted on the efficient and eco-friendly Hedera open-source public network.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1180-1024x614.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="614" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1180-1024x614.png" alt="Shinhan Bank, SCB TechX Successfully Complete Second Stablecoin Pilot On Hedera" class="wp-image-203606" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1180-1024x614.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1180-300x180.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1180-768x461.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1180-750x450.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1180-1140x684.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1180.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Shinhan Bank, SCB TechX Successfully Complete Second Stablecoin Pilot On Hedera 4"></a></figure></div>


<p>During the pilot, real-time settlement and foreign exchange (FX) rate integration was achieved across the Thai Baht (THB), New Taiwan dollar (NTD), and South Korean won (KRW). The PoC, which is EVM-compatible, allows any EVM-based stablecoin issuers to participate using the framework in the future.</p>



<p>This PoC builds upon <a href="https://coincu.com/125948-shinhan-card-launches-blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shinhan Bank</a>&#8216;s previous work in stablecoin international remittances, demonstrating progress in the pursuit of efficient and cost-effective cross-border payments.</p>



<p>Byunghee Kim, Chief of the Blockchain division at Shinhan Bank, expressed satisfaction with the partnership with Hedera and highlighted the importance of stablecoins for facilitating cross-border remittances. He emphasized how stablecoins offer a low-cost and reliable way to transfer value, contributing to financial inclusion and accessibility for underserved communities.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;The successful completion of this second PoC marks an important step forward in our efforts to make cross-border payments faster, cheaper, and more accessible to people around the world.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>SCB TechX also emphasized the potential of stablecoins in increasing financial inclusion and improving access to financial services for individuals and businesses in underserved communities.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>This announcement is a significant milestone for the financial industry as more banks and financial institutions recognize the transformative potential of blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT) in cross-border payments.</p>



<p>Using stablecoins as a solution, banks can leverage an intermediary currency such as a dollar stablecoin to eliminate the need for maintaining accounts worldwide. This approach reduces costs by providing liquidity between local currencies and the dollar, streamlining the payment process.</p>



<p>The scalability of public blockchains and DLT is a challenge for stablecoins. <a href="https://coincu.com/172960-hedera-upgraded-the-mainnet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hedera</a>, with its EVM smart contracts, can handle 300 transactions per second. For transactions that do not require smart contracts, Hedera&#8217;s native token service can scale up to 10,000 transactions per second. The platform is also working on a hybrid version that uses smart contracts for stablecoin management by the issuer instead of every transaction.</p>

<p>Stablecoin usage has predominantly been for crypto transactions and P2P payments. The average cost of remittances worldwide is around 6%, but it varies significantly across jurisdictions. Low-cost networks like Hedera enable transactions at a fraction of a cent, reducing the overall payment costs.</p>



<p>Hedera has introduced a stablecoin accelerator program and plans to open-source major components of the software required for launching stablecoins, further promoting innovation in this space.</p>

<p>This acknowledgment comes as the SEC <a href="https://coincu.com/202973-sec-now-acknowledges-blackrock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continues</a> its comprehensive review process for various ETF proposals.</p>



<p>Valkyrie&#8217;s proposal, outlined in an official filing on July 17, seeks a rule change to list and trade a spot Bitcoin ETF on Nasdaq. As part of the regulatory process, the SEC has opened a public comment period, allowing interested parties to provide feedback within 21 days after publication in the Federal Register. This period of public input is an important step before the SEC proceeds with its official review and evaluation.</p>



<p>Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at <em>Bloomberg</em>, <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1681062886808879104" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> the acceptance of Valkyrie&#8217;s spot Bitcoin ETF application by the SEC. Notably, Valkyrie was the final applicant to submit a spot Bitcoin ETF proposal amid a recent surge of applications. Balchunas also highlighted that Valkyrie has chosen the ticker symbol &#8220;BRRR&#8221; for the Bitcoin ETF on the Nasdaq exchange.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1179-1024x683.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1179-1024x683.png" alt="SEC Now Accepts Valkyrie&#039;s Spot Bitcoin ETF Application" class="wp-image-203596" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1179-1024x683.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1179-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1179-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1179-750x500.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1179-1140x760.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1179.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="SEC Now Accepts Valkyrie&#039;s Spot Bitcoin ETF Application 8"></a></figure></div>


<p>This move by the SEC to accept Valkyrie&#8217;s spot Bitcoin ETF application indicates a growing interest and recognition of the potential benefits of such investment products. Several prominent firms, including BlackRock, VanEck, Invesco, <a href="https://coincu.com/202622-fidelity-fires-up-bitcoin-etf-race/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fidelity</a>, and WisdomTree, have also entered the race to secure SEC approval for their <a href="https://coincu.com/202636-sec-now-reviews-bitwise-bitcoin-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin ETF</a> proposals. The increased attention from major financial players highlights the growing acceptance and adoption of Bitcoin in traditional investment vehicles.</p>



<p>The potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF holds significant implications for the cryptocurrency market. A spot ETF would involve the purchase and custody of actual Bitcoin, with its price linked to the current market spot price. If a Bitcoin spot ETF receives approval from regulatory bodies like the SEC, it would signify a major step toward mainstream acceptance and legitimacy for Bitcoin. Furthermore, the approval could lead to an influx of institutional capital into the cryptocurrency market, bolstering its liquidity and overall growth.</p>

<p>The positive market response to the filing of spot Bitcoin ETFs can already be observed in the price movements of Bitcoin. Following the announcement of the spot Bitcoin ETF filing by BlackRock, Bitcoin experienced a price rally that pushed it above the $30,000 level. Investors are now eagerly awaiting updates on the progress of Bitcoin ETF applications as they anticipate the potential for increased accessibility and institutional participation in the cryptocurrency market.</p>



<p>Overall, the acceptance of Valkyrie&#8217;s spot Bitcoin ETF application by the SEC, along with the growing number of similar proposals, reflects a notable shift in the regulatory landscape toward embracing digital assets. While the SEC&#8217;s review process is ongoing, these developments indicate a growing recognition of the value and potential of Bitcoin ETFs, bringing the cryptocurrency market one step closer to broader acceptance and integration within traditional investment frameworks.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Sui Network&#8217;s daily transactions skyrocketed by over 50 times in two weeks.</em></li>



<li><em>The surge is driven by the popularity of the blockchain game Sui 8192, where each move is recorded as a transaction.</em></li>



<li><em>Sui Network surpasses Solana in daily transactions and holds a market capitalization of around $500 million.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Sui Network, a blockchain platform, has witnessed an unprecedented surge in daily transactions, marking a significant milestone for the network.</strong></h5>

<p>Just four days ago, the daily transactions on the Sui Network <a href="https://coincu.com/202781-sui-network-reaches-explosive-growth-with-1-m/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassed</a> 22.2 million, representing an astounding increase of over 50 times compared to the previous two weeks.

<p>Sui 8192, developed by the team behind the Sui-native Ethos Wallet, has emerged as a major driving force behind the surge in network activity.</p>



<p>The game draws inspiration from the well-known 2048 puzzle game but adds a unique twist by leveraging blockchain technology. Players are tasked with strategically shifting and combining tiles using arrow keys, with the ultimate goal of reaching the coveted 8192 tile.</p>



<p>What sets Sui 8192 apart is that each move made during gameplay is recorded as a transaction on the Sui blockchain, akin to the creation of a non-fungible token (NFT). As a result, players are required to pay gas fees for every transaction, leading to a substantial increase in daily activity on the <a href="https://coincu.com/193868-sui-network-releases-sip-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sui Network</a>.</p>

<p>This remarkable growth in users and transactions has <a href="https://twitter.com/DegenerateNews/status/1680148514838560769" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">propelled</a> the Sui Network ahead of Solana in terms of daily blockchain transactions. Solana, known for its scalability and support for gaming applications, has faced several network outages in recent months and years, allowing Sui to take the spotlight with its impressive surge in network activity. The Sui Network&#8217;s architecture and object-based programming language have been cited as crucial factors contributing to the success of Sui 8192 and the overall network&#8217;s performance.</p>



<p>Looking at the token metrics, the SUI token currently boasts a <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/sui/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">market capitalization</a> of nearly $500 million. Additionally, the daily active address count stands at approximately 30,000, underscoring the growing engagement and adoption of the Sui Network.</p>



<p>At the moment, the SUI token is trading at $0.755. Prior to that, SUI spiked to $0.78 with a gain of nearly 15% in the past 24 hours. Currently, the token&#8217;s momentary response has yet to see a clear bullish signal as the resistance area at $0.75 is still not fully conquered.</p>

<p>In terms of future token issuance, the Sui Foundation has provided a detailed plan. The <a href="https://coincu.com/182613-sui-network-launch-mainnet-on-may-3rd/">Sui mainnet</a> is scheduled to go live on May 3, 2023. The long-term circulating supply of SUI tokens is set at 10 billion, with approximately 5% of the tokens to be in circulation at the mainnet launch. The remaining tokens will be <a href="https://sui.io/token-schedule" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> according to a proposed schedule, with the full token supply expected to be released by April 2030. The Sui Foundation has emphasized that the timetable may be subject to changes to ensure the network&#8217;s stability and vitality.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Cathie Wood remains bullish on Coinbase following the court ruling favoring Ripple Labs against the SEC.</em></li>



<li><em>ARK Invest continues to sell off Coinbase stock, attributing the activity to profit-taking and reallocating capital to other opportunities.</em></li>



<li><em>Industry experts see the Ripple ruling as a potential positive precedent for Coinbase and other exchanges facing regulatory challenges, although concerns about unresolved regulatory aspects remain.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cathie Wood, the founder, and CEO of ARK Investment Management, expressed her optimistic view on cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase following a court ruling in favor of Ripple Labs against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on July 13.</strong></h5>

<p>Despite ARK Invest&#8217;s <a href="https://coincu.com/201934-cathie-woods-ark-invest-cuts-coinbase-shares/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent sales </a>of Coinbase stock, Wood <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2023-07-17/cathie-wood-on-ark-fund-flows-coinbase-ai-investments-video" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remains positive</a> about the exchange, citing the court ruling as a positive development for the industry, she said on <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2023-07-17/cathie-wood-on-ark-fund-flows-coinbase-ai-investments-video" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg TV</a></em>.</p>



<p>ARK Invest recently <a href="https://coincu.com/203046-ark-invest-lose-weight-on-coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold</a> off an additional $50 million worth of Coinbase stock on July 15 as the stock rallied. Wood attributed the selling activity to profit-taking and reallocating capital to other investment opportunities.</p>

<p>Ripple Labs secured a huge victory in its court lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, sending cryptocurrency prices and associated equities up toward the close of the week.</p>



<p>In December 2020, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple, alleging the crypto and blockchain solutions provider of marketing its XRP coin as unregistered securities. A court in the Southern District of New York determined on Thursday that XRP is a security when sold to institutions but not when sold to the general public. After the judgment, XRP surged almost 90% to $0.82.</p>



<p>Wood&#8217;s sentiments align with other industry experts who believe that the Ripple ruling could set a positive precedent for Coinbase and other exchanges currently facing regulatory challenges. The ruling potentially influenced the ongoing legal battles of <a href="https://coincu.com/203016-coinbase-suspends-staking-services-sec-lawsuits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a> and <a href="https://coincu.com/203514-binance-terminates-sponsorship-with-argentina/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a> with the SEC.</p>



<p>Despite receiving a Wells Notice in March and facing a lawsuit from the SEC in June, Coinbase&#8217;s share price has shown resilience, remaining relatively stable. Wood emphasized the robustness of Coinbase&#8217;s stock value.</p>

<p>While many are optimistic about Coinbase&#8217;s future, analysts from Berenberg Capital Markets cautioned that regulatory aspects for crypto exchanges are still unresolved. They specifically mentioned Coinbase Earn, a product offering crypto staking yield, as potentially vulnerable to being defined as a security.</p>



<p>Coinbase&#8217;s stock has performed well this year, rallying 189.3% so far. On Monday, it closed at $105.55, slightly below its one-year high of $107.</p>



<p>Overall, Wood&#8217;s positive outlook on Coinbase is driven by the recent court ruling and the resilience demonstrated by the exchange, despite regulatory challenges.</p>

<p>This innovative solution enables the deployment of <a href="https://coincu.com/140343-neon-labs-plans-to-release-evm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)</a> code on Solana, a feat that was previously not possible. Neon EVM aims to integrate seamlessly with Solana&#8217;s high throughput capabilities, offering developers the opportunity to leverage the native functionality of Solana and reduce operational costs.</p>



<p>The Neon EVM smart contract, built on Solana&#8217;s blockchain, processes wrapped Ethereum transactions, combining the robustness of Ethereum&#8217;s decentralized application (dApp) environment with Solana&#8217;s highly efficient infrastructure. Developers can now deploy Ethereum dApps directly on the <a href="https://coincu.com/202186-solana-is-now-out-of-bear-price-zone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solana</a> network, benefiting from Solana&#8217;s technical capabilities with minimal code adjustments.</p>

<p>Traditionally, achieving cost-effectiveness for Ethereum Virtual Machine dApps involved using rollups or sidechains. The introduction of Neon EVM on Solana presents a layer 2 alternative, enabling significant savings in transaction costs.</p>



<p>While Ethereum&#8217;s average transaction fee is around $2, using layer 2 solutions can bring costs down to $0.5-$0.1. In contrast, Solana boasts an average transaction fee of just 0.00001 SOL (~$0.0002) per transaction, offering remarkable savings of 10,000x.

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Binance, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, has unexpectedly terminated its sponsorship agreement with the Argentina national football team.</em></li>



<li><em>The deal, signed in early 2022, was controversial as the exchange competed with the Chiliz/Socios fan token project for sponsorship rights.</em></li>



<li><em>Binance&#8217;s decision comes amidst growing regulatory challenges, declining profits, and recent layoffs at the exchange.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Binance, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, has <a href="https://twitter.com/BinanceArg/status/1680971083904700416" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">terminated</a> its sponsorship agreement with the reigning World Cup champion, Argentina. The unexpected move was announced on Twitter, stating that the exchange had ended its sponsorship of the Argentina football team.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1161.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1161-1024x576.png" alt="Binance Terminates Sponsorship Deal With Argentina Amid Falling Profit" class="wp-image-203516" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1161-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1161-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1161-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1161-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1161-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1161.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Binance Terminates Sponsorship Deal With Argentina Amid Falling Profit 28"></a></figure></div>


<p>The sponsorship agreement between the exchange and Argentina was signed in early 2022 for a period of five years. The exact value of the agreement was not disclosed. As part of the deal, Binance&#8217;s logo was set to appear on the team&#8217;s training jerseys and stadiums during friendlies featuring Argentina.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Binance has decided to end its association with the AFA (Argentine Football Association). We regularly evaluate the results of our partnerships around the world and unfortunately, despite being offered time and opportunity, AFA has not fully met its contractual obligations, which goes against our business values ​​and our association principles. Binance remains committed to growing in Argentina and continues to engage with local partners, including prestigious universities, with the goal of continuing to expand educational efforts and strategic business alliances,&#8221; the exchange stated.<a href="https://twitter.com/BinanceArg/status/1680971083904700416" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The sponsorship deal itself was surrounded by controversy, as Binance competed with the Chiliz/Socios fan token issuance project to become the sponsor for the Argentina team, including star player Lionel Messi. Socios, feeling aggrieved, sued the Argentine Football Federation (AFA), seeking to be the sole fan token partner until 2026.</p>

<p>This termination of sponsorship comes at a challenging time for Binance. The exchange has faced regulatory and legal challenges globally, resulting in <a href="https://coincu.com/202996-binance-fired-1000-people-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent layoffs</a> of over 1,000 employees. The <a href="https://coincu.com/203495-binance-cuts-benefits-and-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">declining profits</a> of the company have also led to the cessation of certain employee benefits.</p>



<p>In addition to the Argentina football team, the exchange sponsors other teams and issues fan tokens for S.S Lazio (Italy), FC Porto (Portugal), and Santos FC (Brazil). The exchange has also partnered with the Confederation of African Football to sponsor the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (CAN) and collaborates with the F1 Alpine team. Binance&#8217;s NFT platform has partnered with Cristiano Ronaldo to release NFT collections for fans.</p>



<p>In recent years, Binance has faced various legal and business challenges. The exchange has been sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and is rumored to face potential criminal prosecution by the US Department of Justice. It has encountered regulatory troubles in several countries, including the UK, the Netherlands, Belgium, Cyprus, Brazil, Austria, France, Germany, and Australia.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1163.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1163.png" alt="Binance Terminates Sponsorship Deal With Argentina Amid Falling Profit" class="wp-image-203519" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1163.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1163-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1163-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1163-750x500.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Binance Terminates Sponsorship Deal With Argentina Amid Falling Profit 30"></a></figure></div>


<p>These developments have impacted the exchange&#8217;s market share, particularly in the US, where its <a href="https://coincu.com/197963-binanceus-lost-as-judge-rejects-its-accusations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance.US</a> platform has lost a banking partner, limiting its ability to handle USD transactions. The exchange has also reportedly laid off a significant number of employees, although Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has disputed the accuracy of the reported figures.</p>



<p>In late June, several key members of Binance&#8217;s senior management resigned, including the Chief Counsel, Chief Strategy Officer, and Vice President of Legal Compliance. These departures are believed to be linked to the ongoing investigation by the US Department of Justice into Binance&#8217;s activities.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Binance, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, is facing financial challenges as it grapples with falling profits and regulatory issues.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1158.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1158-1024x576.png" alt="Binance Cuts Benefits Of Employees Amid Regulatory Challenge" class="wp-image-203507" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1158-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1158-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1158-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1158-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1158-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1158.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Binance Cuts Benefits Of Employees Amid Regulatory Challenge 31"></a></figure></div>


<p>As Coincu <a href="https://coincu.com/202996-binance-fired-1000-people-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, the company recently made headlines for laying off over 1,000 employees, and now it has been revealed that Binance is also reducing employee benefits as part of its cost-cutting measures.</p>



<p>According to the<em> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/binance-cuts-back-employee-benefits-citing-decline-in-profit-51d51cf7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wall Street Journal</a></em>, Binance has decided to cut back on several employee benefits, including mobile-phone reimbursement, fitness reimbursement, and work-from-home expenses. These changes were communicated to employees through an internal message viewed by the publication. The message cited the current market environment and regulatory climate, which have led to a decline in profit, as the reasons for scaling back on benefits. The exchange hinted that further cost-cutting actions may be necessary in the future.</p>



<p>The decision to reduce benefits comes at a time when Binance is facing regulatory challenges in multiple jurisdictions. The exchange has been <a href="https://coincu.com/200786-binance-in-crisis-executives-flee-storms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">embroiled</a> in lawsuits from regulatory bodies such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

<p>During a company meeting on its sixth anniversary, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, also known as CZ, <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1679951762906595330" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">assured</a> employees that the exchange remains profitable and has not been impacted by the SEC lawsuit. However, he cautioned that additional layoffs could occur every three to six months, and he expressed uncertainty about when the cut benefits would be reinstated.</p>



<p>The recent layoffs and benefit reductions have raised concerns among employees and industry observers. Some former employees have reported that several hundred customer-service employees were let go, adding to the already significant number of layoffs. CZ disputed the reported numbers and stated that layoffs are a regular occurrence in any company.</p>

<p>Binance&#8217;s regulatory struggles have not been limited to the United States. The exchange has faced challenges in Europe, leading to its exit from certain markets due to regulatory hurdles. These issues have contributed to a decline in Binance&#8217;s market dominance and raised questions about its ability to navigate the evolving regulatory landscape.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://coincu.com/200804-binance-abandons-dutch-market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a> adjusts its operations to address financial strain and regulatory pressures, the industry will closely monitor its future actions. Rebuilding market share and ensuring compliance with regulations will be key priorities for the exchange as it seeks to regain stability in the highly competitive cryptocurrency market.</p>
