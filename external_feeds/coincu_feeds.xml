<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color"><strong>Introduction Of UPbit</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Chi-Hyung Song</strong> serves as the Chief Executive Officer of the UPbit exchange, which is owned and operated by Dunamu. <strong>A connection has been established between the cryptocurrency exchange and the American cryptocurrency exchange known as Bittrex.</strong> The development of the UPbit exchange was facilitated by the Bittrex exchange. As a result of the rising amount of transactions that take place there, the cryptocurrency exchange has developed to become the largest cryptocurrency exchange for digital assets by the year 2018.</p>



<p>Due to the fact that the <a href="https://upbit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UPbit website</a> and trading platform are <strong>now only available in Korean</strong>, the company&#8217;s ability to attract customers from all over the world will be severely hindered. The Google translation, on the other hand, is rather good, which suggests that both the website and the trading platform may be accessed reasonably effectively in English and, most likely, in other languages as well.<strong> The fact that international consumers must utilize the same procedure as South Koreans</strong> in order to register and trade with the exchange, which is extremely geo-specific, is <strong>the most significant obstacle that they must overcome</strong>. A South Korean telecom operator requires users to have a KakaoTalk account in addition to <strong>a Kakao Pay account</strong> in order to log in and verify their identity. To put it simply, if you do not currently reside in South Korea, it will be impossible for you to create an account with UPbit.</p>



<p>The desktop and mobile app versions of the exchange platform are quite <strong>similar to the KakaoStock platforms.</strong> In essence, they are a variant of the same technology that has been adapted to facilitate bitcoin trading. This suggests that the technology possesses an exceptionally high level of quality in terms of design, usability, and functionality. The exchange does not offer leveraged trading for cryptocurrencies; nevertheless, it does give traders with a resource that is both analytical and newsfeed-based of the highest quality.</p>



<p><a href="https://news.coincu.com/147505-upbit-parent-company-prevents-staff-trading/">UPbit </a>is a cryptocurrency exchange that allows consumers to purchase cryptocurrency, make deposits using fiat cash, or trade their existing crypto assets for other cryptocurrencies. The trading services offered by<strong> the platform come with associated costs and charges, both of which add to the income generated by the exchange.</strong> Because <strong>UPbit is not a DEX</strong> (decentralized exchange), the company has full control of its operations, which it appears to have utilized well.</p>



<p>Registered users have the ability to exchange their assets or spend fiat currency to obtain additional assets through a straightforward process. The monies can be withdrawn to the wallet once the costs linked with the transaction have been paid.</p>

<h3>Exchange Markets</h3>



<p>At the moment, the<strong> South Korean Won is the only fiat currency that UPbit accepts</strong>. Transactions involving the Won may be carried out both into and out of bank accounts located in South Korea. Because of its collaboration with Bittrex, UPbit now provides customers with access to more than one hundred different cryptocurrencies in the form of coins and tokens. There is access to almost all of<strong> the top 100 cryptocurrencies ranked by market capitalization,</strong> in addition to other cryptocurrencies not included in that list.</p>



<h3>Fees and Charges</h3>



<p>Takers and creators on the UPbit platform each have to pay a fee in order to use it. It is possible that the<strong> flat charge rate of 0.25%</strong> for trading volume is not the lowest in the industry. To this day,<strong> it does not appear to have any effect on the platform&#8217;s normal flow of incoming and leaving deals.</strong> A constant maker on the platform does not have an advantage due to the fact that the charge is the same for both takers and makers. This is because consistent makers are able to obtain lower rates on other exchanges. Users don&#8217;t have to pay anything to make deposits on UPbit; however,<strong> there is a fee associated with withdrawing funds.</strong> The fees associated with withdrawing each cryptocurrency are distinct from one another. The exchange <strong>does not levy any hidden or extra costs on top of these prices; </strong>they are the only fees that are imposed.</p>



<h3>Security and Fairness</h3>



<p>As might be anticipated from a cryptocurrency exchange that is <strong>backed by one of South Korea&#8217;s major internet and Fintech heavyweights in the form of Kakao,</strong> the cyber security standards that UPbit traders rely on to protect themselves are quite robust. <strong>The security for the wallets is provided by BitGo</strong>, which is generally recognized as the global standard for multi-signature wallets and is used by <strong>a substantial number of the world&#8217;s most famous cryptocurrency exchanges.</strong> BitGo is the global standard for multi-signature wallets. The partnership with Kakao Pay, a mobile payments app that is operated by the company that is also a participant in this venture, ensures the safety of customer accounts. In terms of market share, Kakao Pay is the second most popular mobile payment system in South Korea behind Samsung Pay. On the question of whether or not the<strong> UPbit&#8217;s cybersecurity criteria are superior</strong>, there is little space for disagreement.</p>

<h3>Trading Options</h3>



<p>Customers of the UPbit exchange can take advantage of the practicality of a mobile phone application that is provided as a service. Customers can trade using either a mobile application or a desktop software that is made available to them. <strong>Customers and users can get this mobile app by heading to either the Google Play Store or the App Store.</strong> Both stores are linked in the previous sentence. Users also have the option of trading using a mobile app, which is accessible to them in the event that they do not desire to trade using the desktop software. This option is available to they in the event that users do not wish to trade using the desktop app. Trading cryptocurrencies is typically done using a desktop application since customers find it to be more convenient.</p>



<h3>Currencies and Countries</h3>



<p>The translation of the website into other languages is made possible with the assistance of Google Translate; nonetheless,<strong> the Republic of South Korea is the primary focus of the exchange.</strong> The website provides a list of the countries that have provided help (Singapore, Thailand, South Korea, and Indonesia, at the time of writing of this article). <strong>The United States of America is not included on the list of nations that UPbit supports.</strong></p>



<p>The list of fiat currencies that can be used is as short as it can possibly be. The Won is the only fiat currency used in this country. When it comes to digital currencies, the quantity of available assets might cover a broad spectrum. Over one hundred different assets are supported by means of an intricate network that includes both its own exchange and a collaboration with Bittrex, a prominent cryptocurrency exchange.</p>

<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color"><strong>Pros and Cons</strong></h2>



<h3>Pros</h3>



<ul>
<li>Supported are well over a hundred different cryptocurrencies.</li>



<li>Sponsored by one of the most successful technological businesses in South Korea</li>



<li>The most advanced technology now employed by trading platforms.</li>



<li>Superior levels of online protection</li>
</ul>



<h3>Cons</h3>



<ul>
<li>Trading on this site might be challenging for those who are not from South Korea.</li>



<li>Only the South Korean Won, a fiat money, is supported here.</li>



<li>There is no provision for margin trading.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color"><strong>Is It Safe To Use UPbit?</strong></h2>



<p>The fact that<strong> the exchange is situated in one of the crypto capitals of the globe </strong>explains why it has such a large user base and why it has not been the subject of any allegations of fraud. The closely knit architecture focuses on a specific user base, which doubles as a barrier to protect against potentially harmful materials. <strong>UPbit operates as a controlled trading platform. </strong>While the corporation itself is responsible for the governance and regulation of the platform, the platform is still subject to the laws and rules that are applicable only in the particular geographic location. However, one thing to keep in mind is that in order to register on the exchange, you need to have a phone network in South Korea in addition to a few other things that are <strong>region-specific</strong>. Users located in other countries may experience difficulty complying with the regulations as a result of this.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>It is not a coincidence that within a matter of months, UPbit has become the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world and, according to the data provided by CoinMarketCap, the fifth largest in the world by daily turnover.<strong> UPbit&#8217;s meteoric rise has been driven entirely by the company&#8217;s dedication to innovation and customer service. </strong>The partnership with Bittrex, the major US exchange, that allowed well over cryptocurrencies to be supported, has also gone a long way toward quickly establishing the exchange among the global elite. The exchange has what is arguably the most serious backing in the world in the form of Kakao Corp., the South Korean internet giant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, the partnership with Bittrex has allowed well over cryptocurrencies to be supported. When it comes to both technology and safety, UPbit has very few competitors, and its selection of currencies that can be traded is right up there with the best of them. <strong>The one significant negative is that UPbit is almost exclusively a South Korean exchange</strong>; as a result, opening an account and engaging in trading might be challenging for individuals of other nationalities.</p>

<h5><strong>The cross-chain protocol has become indispensable with the development of multi-chain ecology, but because it carries a large number of funds, it belongs to a category of projects with high technical and security difficulties. In 2022 alone, cross-chain bridges such as Wormhole, Ronin Network, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/154719-bnb-chain-becomes-largest-layer1-blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BNB Chain</a>, Horizon, and Nomad have lost hundreds of millions of dollars in funds due to hacker attacks.</strong></h5>



<h5><strong>Back to the fundamentals of the project, security is the most important issue for cross-chain protocols. The zero-knowledge proof technology solution using &#8220;trustless&#8221; can avoid possible manual intervention and human factors in the design of cross-chain protocols and may become a future development route. And from there, Way Network was born.</strong></h5>

<h2>The development history of cross-chain protocol</h2>



<p>The development of cross-chain protocols can be seen as a process of continuous decentralization and reduction of external conditional intervention. After excluding fully centralized cross-chain protocols such as exchanges and wallets, the commonly used so-called decentralized cross-chain protocols still adopt a relatively centralized approach. The specific security mechanisms in such schemes include POS consensus, multi-signature and secure multi-party computing. </p>



<p>This is also the type of cross-chain solution that is most prone to security incidents, and it is difficult for the project party to prove its innocence after funds are stolen. For example, although<strong> Ronin Network</strong> needs 5 of the 9 verifiers to complete the withdrawal, Sky Mavis controls 4 of them and can sign on behalf of another verifier, <strong>Axie DAO</strong>. Therefore, hackers only need to control <strong>Sky Mavis</strong>. Controlled 5 of 9 validators, completing the attack.</p>



<p>In recent months, cross-chain protocols using decentralized security mechanisms led by <strong>LayerZero</strong> have gradually gained an advantage in development. LayerZero is a full-chain interoperability protocol. It deploys an Endpoint on each supported chain. The Endpoint will run an ultra-light node, and transmit block headers containing cross-chain information on demand through Oracle (oracle machine), and then The proof information is transmitted through the Relayer (repeater) for verification, so as to ensure the correctness of the information. This makes LayerZero rely on two off-chain components, the relay and the oracle, to transmit messages between different chains. </p>



<p>Users must trust that the relay and the oracle will not conspire to do evil, and they must also believe that the protocol itself will not cause harm to the Relayer. However, according to the experiments of <strong>L2BEAT</strong> and others, in LayerZero&#8217;s architecture, repeaters and oracles can be changed, and attackers can extract underlying assets by changing repeaters and oracles at any time.</p>

<p>This does not mean that the development of cross-chain protocols stops here. Among the two main expansion schemes of <strong>Ethereum</strong>, the founder <strong>Vitalik</strong> <strong>Buterin</strong> believes that <strong>ZK Rollup will beat Optimistic Rollup in the long run</strong>. Recently, projects represented by <strong>Way Network </strong>have begun to apply <strong>zero-knowledge proof </strong>(ZKP) technology to cross-chain protocols to realize cross-chain bridges without trust assumptions. Users do not need to trust any external third parties, including the protocol itself, and only need to pass mathematical and cryptographic proofs to ensure the security of inter-chain communication.</p>



<p>The first-generation cross-chain protocol is usually based on POS, multi-signature, and multi-party security calculations. Generally, it needs to be verified by dozens of nodes to complete the cross-chain information transmission; the second-generation cross-chain protocol is based on game theory. Assuming that it is expanded, the logic that originally required multi-party verification or even dozens of verifications in the first generation of products is simplified to unilaterally verify the correctness of relay information transmission through the oracle machine Oracle. </p>

<p>The third-generation cross-chain protocol uses pure mathematics and cryptography to make zero-knowledge proofs of the information transmission process and verifies the verification contract deployed on the target chain to ensure the validity of the proof itself, information and user. <strong>Payload</strong>.</p>



<h2>Technical architecture of Way Network</h2>



<p>Way Network is a full-chain interoperability protocol based on zero-knowledge proof without any trust assumptions. It is designed with a modular architecture so that applications can easily integrate with it. Way Network mainly includes 3 routes and 4 components. </p>



<p>Among the three routes, the core route is realized through <strong>zkRelayer</strong>; the upper route is realized through Way Luggage; the lower route is realized through Way IMTP. The 4 components include <strong>Sender</strong> and <strong>Receiver</strong> smart contracts, <strong>zkRelayer</strong>, <strong>Luggage</strong> and <strong>IMTP</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>zkRelayer</strong> relays block headers from the source chain as well as proofs, messages and payloads on the target chain. zkRelayer is also the key to Way Network&#8217;s trustless assumption and scalability, which will be described in detail below.</p>



<p><strong>Way Luggage</strong> is a cross-chain data transfer protocol in which users hold data ownership and is responsible for ensuring the availability of cross-chain data. In the context of <strong>Web2</strong>, user data is stored on a specific centralized server, the ownership of the data belongs to the platform, and the user does not have any authority over the data itself. </p>



<p>An important difference between <strong>Web3</strong> and <strong>Web2</strong> is in solving the problem of data ownership. Users can store data on the blockchain through IPFS, Filecoin, Arweave and other decentralized storage projects. On this basis, <strong>Way Luggage p</strong>rovides cross-chain authority control, inter-chain data transmission and processing, privacy protection and other technologies to ensure that users truly own data ownership.</p>



<p>Way IMTP is an inter-chain message transmission protocol that provides faster inter-chain communication by sending verified messages to dApps. Users can preview messages before the messages on the target chain are verified, which can save Receiver’s verification time on the target chain. </p>



<p>The difference between <strong>IMTP</strong> and <strong>XMTP</strong>, another Web3 encrypted communication protocol, is that the former solves the problem of inter-chain communication, while the latter solves the problem of communication between users or applications on the same chain, which is similar to WAN and The difference between LANs.</p>



<p>The Sender contract on the source chain and the Receiver contract on the target chain is a pair of smart contracts based on zkRelayer&#8217;s application. The Sender contract is responsible for receiving cross-chain messages on the source chain and sending them to zkRelayer; Receiver maintains a list of the latest block headers and updates them after verifying zkRelayer&#8217;s proof.</p>



<p>Combining zkRelayer, Way Luggage, Way IMTP and other components, Way Network can not only cross-chain assets but also transmit instant messages, status and files between blockchains, getting rid of the limitations of cross-chain assets.</p>



<h2>How to realize cross-chain communication without trust assumptions?</h2>



<p>The cross-chain process needs to consider the trade-offs among factors such as security, decentralization, cross-chain cost, and cross-chain efficiency. Most cross-chain protocols have their own priorities, but realizing the trustless assumption has become the current development of cross-chain protocols. an important requirement.</p>



<p>zkRelayer is the key to realizing trust-free assumption and scalability. It uses zero-knowledge proof technology to send and receive messages in a trust-free way, providing a secure environment for inter-chain message transmission. </p>



<p>In the entire proof process of<strong> Way Network,</strong> the process of chain<strong> A→Sender→zkRelayer→ZK Verifier→Receiver→B </strong>chain only relies on mathematical and cryptographic formulas. Once the code is successfully deployed, it no longer needs the intervention of external conditions, because the code It will be open source, and it can also be verified that no external force can affect the cross-chain process.</p>



<p>The cross-chain communication solution based on zkRelayer will have the following advantages:</p>



<ul>
<li>Trustless security without trust assumptions</li>



<li>No permission required </li>



<li>Decentralized</li>



<li>Versatile and pervasive</li>



<li>Scalable and extensible</li>



<li>High-efficiency and low cost</li>
</ul>



<p>At the heart of zkRelayer is zkProver, which is responsible for performing the most computationally demanding generation of zero-knowledge proofs. We know that zero-knowledge proof is a cryptographic technique in which the prover can convince the verifier that a certain result is correct without providing any useful information to the verifier.</p>

<p>The zero-knowledge proof system used by Way Network is called <strong>zkSpark</strong>, which is a transparent zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive proof of knowledge (zkSNARK), which has the advantage of short proof and verification time, but does not require trust initialization and does not involve any confidentiality content, and does not require complex steps to generate public parameters.</p>



<p><strong>zkSpark</strong> is based on sublinear proof time programmable codes, which is the time-optimal proof scheme among all <strong>ZKPs</strong>. Verification proofs will incur sublinear costs. zkSpark is also a cryptographic primitive designed by the Way Network team. On the basis of not increasing information transmission, <strong>zkProver</strong> will not increase the time for relaying messages, making the user&#8217;s cross-chain process safe and credible.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>The development of cross-chain protocols can be seen as a process of continuous decentralization and reduction of external conditional intervention. Way Network adopts zero-knowledge proof technology. The cross-chain bridge based on zkRelayer can truly realize the trustless assumption. After deployment, it only relies on mathematical and cryptographic algorithms to ensure the security of the cross-chain. It is expected to become the next generation of cross-chain protocol.</p>



<p>On the basis of asset cross-chain, Way Network will also realize the application of cross-chain bridge in <strong>DeFi</strong>, social, <strong>NFT</strong> market and games. The most promising of these are full-chain DEX, cross-chain lending, and decentralized stablecoins in DeFi.</p>

<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Three tokenized U.S. Treasuries and bond products, introducing a whitelist system</h2>



<p>As an important means of financing and financial instruments, bonds are low-risk safe-haven assets and fixed-income investment products, especially the interest rate of US treasury bonds is generally recognized as the risk-free interest rate in the market. </p>



<p>However, the thunder of high-yield products such as <strong>UST</strong>, which once advertised <strong>20% interest</strong> in the encryption market, is hitting investors&#8217; confidence, and the yield performance of the DeFi field, which focuses on high returns, is not satisfactory. Take the leading lending projects Compound and Aave as examples. <strong>LoanScan</strong> data shows that as of <strong>January 21</strong>, the deposit rates of <strong>USDC</strong> on <strong>Compound</strong> and <strong>Aave</strong> have <a href="https://linen.app/interest-rates/borrow/historical" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped</a> to <strong>2.34%</strong> and<strong> 2.36%</strong>, which are <strong>far lower than the interest rates on U.S. Treasury bonds.</strong></p>

<p>In order to balance exposure risks and improve profitability to the greatest extent, in fact, many crypto projects choose treasury bonds as their investment choice. For example, MakerDAO allocated 500 million DAI to invest in U.S. treasury bonds and corporate bonds, and Circle will allocate all <strong>USDC</strong> reserves of Gold into the form of cash and short-term U.S. Treasuries, USDT issuer <strong>Tether</strong> has increased its holdings of U.S. Treasuries by more than <strong>$10 billion </strong>after removing commercial paper from its reserves, Sui development company Mysten Labs treasury is all funded by cash and Composition of the national debt.</p>



<p><strong>Ondo Finance </strong>is a large-scale, highly liquid ETF managed by institutions such as asset management giant <strong>BlackRock</strong> and <strong>Pacific Investment Management Corporation (PIMCO)</strong>. It has launched three tokenized U.S. Treasury bonds and bond products, namely U.S. government bond funds OUSG), <strong>Short-Term Investment Grade Bond Funds (OSTB)</strong> and <strong>High Yield Corporate Bond Fund (OHYG).</strong></p>



<p>Among them, <strong>OUSG</strong> will invest exclusively in short-term U.S. Treasury bonds, initially through the <strong>BlackRock U.S. Short-Term Treasury Bond ETF (SHV)</strong>, which is expected to yield <strong>4.62%</strong>; OSTB will invest in short-term investment-grade corporate bonds, initially through <strong>PIMCO Enhanced Short-Term Maturity Active ETF (MINT)</strong>, yielding<strong> 5.45%</strong>; OHYG will invest in high-yield corporate bonds, initially via <strong>BlackRock iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond (HYG)</strong>, yielding <strong>8.02%</strong>. Bond investors can transfer on-chain the net equity value of the tokenized fund approved by the smart contract, and Ondo Finance will charge an annual management fee of <strong>0.15%</strong>.</p>



<p>In view of the failure of unregulated companies in the encryption field in 2022, Ondo Finance chose to cooperate with strictly regulated third-party service providers and hold assets in bankrupt far-qualified custody institutions.</p>



<p> Among them, Clear Street, a prime brokerage platform for institutional investors, is the main broker of the fund and will keep the fund&#8217;s securities in the DTC (American Depository Trust Company) account; Coinbase Custody will take care of any stable assets held by the fund. </p>



<p><strong>Coinbase</strong> <strong>Prime</strong> handles the conversion between stablecoins and fiat currencies; Richey May, an accounting and financial consulting company will serve as the fund&#8217;s tax consultant and auditor. The company has been rated as the best company by Inside Public Accounting many times.</p>

<p>However, for compliance reasons, Ondo Finance will adopt a whitelist system. Investors need to pass KYC and AML screening before they can sign the subscription documents. Stablecoins or US dollars can be used. The SEC defines <strong>a &#8220;qualified purchaser&#8221; as an individual or entity investing at least $5 million.</strong></p>



<p>Ondo Finance was founded by former Goldman Sachs digital asset team member Nathan Allman and former Goldman Sachs technology team vice president Pinku Surana. It was originally an Ethereum-based DeFi protocol that allowed users to initiate crypto-backed loans to earn income. Lenders and borrowers jointly invest funds in “Ondo Vaults” that use smart contracts to enforce loan terms. </p>



<p>During 2022, Ondo Finance raised $10 million through public token sales, and completed $20 million in financing led by <strong>Founders Fund </strong>and <strong>Pantera Capital. </strong>Previously, Ondo Finance and the stablecoin protocol <strong>Fei Protocol </strong>launched <strong>Liquidity as a Service</strong>, invested a total of <strong>$100 million</strong> in the deployment of the plan, and reached cooperation with <strong>UMA, GRO, FOX, NEAR</strong> and other well-known DeFi protocols through Liquidity as a Service Help them increase the liquidity of decentralized exchanges, eliminate unsustainable liquidity mining activities that cause currency price fluctuations, but currently, the Vault pages with Fei Protocol and UMA are also 404. It’s worth mentioning that Fei Protocol went out of business after it was hacked and $80 million was stolen.</p>



<p>However, at present, Ondo Finance’s official website has no relevant content on the previous lending and liquidity-as-a-service business. According to the speech of its CEO, Nathan Allman, the business transformation has been carried out. Alternatives to bridge the gap between low-yield and high-risk returns on-chain, allowing investors to quickly and easily switch back and forth between stablecoins and traditional assets, especially highly liquid, low-risk products.”</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Breaking through the volume bottleneck, real-world assets accelerate into DeFi</h2>



<p>In fact, looking at most DeFi protocols, most of them revolve around the original assets on the chain, which also presents an invisible ceiling for the development of DeFi. <strong>DefiLlama</strong> data. <a href="https://defillama.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shows</a> that in the past year, affected by the sharp decline in encrypted assets, the total lock-up volume of DeFi has dropped from a maximum of over <strong>$180 billion </strong>to about <strong>$39 billion</strong>, a drop of <strong>more than 78%</strong>, which is different from the volume of traditional assets.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-21-at-17.47.19.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="349" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-21-at-17.47.19-1024x349.png" alt="Screenshot 2023 01 21 at 17.47.19" class="wp-image-161705" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-21-at-17.47.19-1024x349.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-21-at-17.47.19-300x102.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-21-at-17.47.19-768x262.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-21-at-17.47.19-1536x524.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-21-at-17.47.19-2048x698.png 2048w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-21-at-17.47.19-750x256.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-21-at-17.47.19-1140x389.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Can Ondo Finance Break Through By Allowing Stablecoins To Buy Government Bonds? 18"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">   </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Before that, there have actually been many projects testing the waters to introduce real assets into DeFi. For example, <strong>JPMorgan Chase, DBS Bank</strong> and <strong>SBI Digital Asset Holdings </strong>have used the Aave protocol on Polygon to complete foreign exchange and government bond transactions on the Ethereum network. The bank swapped tokenized versions of Singapore government securities for Japanese government bonds and yen for Singapore dollars as a test. However, this on-chain foreign exchange and bond exchange test is aimed at regulators such as the Monetary Authority of Singapore.</p>



<p>Another example is MakerDAO issuing the world&#8217;s first DeFi-based real asset loan. The <strong>Fix&amp;Flip</strong> loan pool<strong> New Silver</strong> on Tinlake, a lending platform based on the Centrifuge protocol, as the asset initiator, used MakerDAO as a credit tool to obtain the first loan. Not only that, but <strong>MakerDAO</strong> also jointly launched a $220 million fund with BlockTower Credit to provide capital for real-world assets. Aave has partnered with the encryption company Centrifuge to launch a real-world asset market, RWA Market, which allows companies to invest in real-world asset-backed markets in all aspects of their business.</p>



<p>In general, for DeFi, which is stuck in a development bottleneck, although it achieved rapid ecological expansion with high returns in the early stage, it still cannot compete with traditional finance. Only by embracing real-world assets can it better enter the mainstream world. Ondo Finance and other projects put traditional assets on the chain, which will help DeFi open the door to the incremental market and realize a new paradigm for the application of traditional assets.</p>

<p>Al-declaration Zeyoudi&#8217;s is similar to Saudi Arabia&#8217;s neighbor. <strong>Mohammed Al-Jadaan</strong>, the Saudi finance minister, stated earlier this week that the country is open to talking about<strong> trading in currencies other than the US dollar.</strong></p>



<p>Some of the largest economies in the world are looking at methods to avoid the US currency due to the dollar&#8217;s strength in the first half of last year and its use as a tool to enforce sanctions against <strong>Russia</strong>. <a href="https://news.coincu.com/156410-china-will-launch-first-nft-marketplace/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">China</a> has worked to increase the usage of the yuan in transactions with significant exporters of energy and commodities in an effort to increase the yuan&#8217;s global appeal.</p>



<p>The <strong>Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA)</strong> must provide companies operating in cryptocurrency activities a license and permission, according to new regulations announced by the <strong>UAE Cabinet</strong> last week.</p>



<p>The principles set forth a welcoming posture towards cryptocurrencies while also promising to follow international guidelines for fighting money laundering and terrorist funding and supporting financial penalties. This, along with Al-Zeyoudi&#8217;s statements, shows that the UAE is working hard to develop the crypto industry in the country.</p>

<p>The foundation <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/01/20/stellar-foundation-nicked-by-genesis-bankruptcy-with-13m-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> in a statement to <em>CoinDesk</em> that it gave around <strong>$13 million</strong> to <strong>Genesis</strong> in <strong>2022</strong>, but it described the amount as <strong>&#8220;immaterial&#8221; in comparison to the rest of its coffers.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://stellar.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stellar Development Foundation</a> now has<strong> 30 billion XLM </strong>in its possession. At the current exchange rate, Stellar&#8217;s XLM token holdings give the company a paper worth of almost <strong>$200 million</strong>.</p>



<p>Although the foundation asserts that it has mostly avoided damage from the Genesis scandal, the intertwining of an ecosystem fund&#8217;s assets with the over-the-counter crypto lending desk highlights exactly how extensive the Genesis scandal&#8217;s ripple effects may be.</p>



<p>The pension funds of<strong> Fairfax County, Virginia</strong>, and <strong>MoonAlpha Finance</strong>, the group behind <strong>Babel Finance</strong>, which is owed <strong>$150 million</strong>, were also among the biggest Genesis disclosed in the bankruptcy papers on Thursday.</p>

<p>These companies make up Genesis&#8217; crypto financing division, which was upended by the collapses of hedge fund <strong>Three Arrows Capital</strong> and cryptocurrency exchange <strong>FTX</strong> last year.

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Avraham Eisenberg was charged by the SEC because the American securities regulator said Eisenberg had stolen $116 million from Mango Markets.</em></li>



<li><em>The MNGO token, a governance token that the agency said was issued and sold as security was controlled by Eisenberg.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>Avraham Eisenberg was accused by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of planning an attack on Solana-backed Mango Markets that resulted in the theft of $116 million from the cryptocurrency trading platform.</strong></h5>

<p><strong>Eisenberg</strong>, a citizen of the United States, will be sent to New York to face the numerous criminal and civil allegations brought against him after being detained there in December. The <strong>MNGO</strong> <strong>token</strong>, a governance token that the <a href="https://news.coincu.com/159258-sec-also-investigating-mango-exploiter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEC</a> said was marketed and sold as a <strong>security</strong>, was manipulated by <strong>Eisenberg</strong>, according to the agency.</p>



<p><strong>Eisenberg</strong> allegedly violated a number of federal securities laws, including several anti-fraud and anti-market manipulation rules, according to the petition.</p>



<p>As was<a href="https://news.coincu.com/159137-cftc-accuses-mango-markets-exploiter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> previously Coincu&#8217;s report</a>, <strong>Eisenberg</strong> is also under investigation by the <strong>Justice Department</strong> and the <strong>Commodity Futures Trading Commission.</strong></p>



<p>The agency <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-13" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> in a statement that investigations into further suspected breaches of securities laws, as well as other organizations and people connected to the alleged misbehavior, are still underway. According to the complaint, Mango Markets is not operating.</p>



<p><strong>Eisenberg</strong> started a conspiracy to steal around <strong>$116 million</strong> worth of cryptocurrency from the <strong>Mango Markets </strong>platform on <strong>October 11, 2022</strong>. In order to exchange a significant quantity of crypto derivatives for <strong>MNGO</strong> <strong>tokens</strong>, he reportedly utilized a <strong>Mango Markets account</strong> under his control and a different account to purchase the same derivatives.</p>

<p><strong>Eisenberg</strong> thereafter made a number of big purchases of the seldom traded <strong>MNGO</strong> <strong>token</strong> to artificially boost its price in comparison to the cryptocurrency <strong>USD</strong> <strong>Coin</strong>, the agency claimed.</p>



<p>On Twitter in October of last year, he boasted about the initial attack and <strong>called it a &#8220;highly profitable trading strategy.&#8221;</strong> The tactic, he claimed, was carried out by a group of users, and it briefly put <strong>Mango</strong> <strong>Markets</strong> out of company.</p>



<p>Under the leadership of current Chair <a href="https://news.coincu.com/139096-gary-gensler-cited-enforcement-actions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gary Gensler</a>, who has stated his belief that almost all crypto assets qualify as securities, the SEC has increased its examination of the cryptocurrency market.</p>
