<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/moonbirds-spotify-nft-music/">Moonbirds Partners with Spotify to Enable NFT Music Unlocks</a></p>
<p>The Moonbirds (MOONBIRD), an <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a> ERC-721 NFT token with a total supply of 10k units, has announced a strategic partnership with <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/spotify/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spotify Technology S.A</a> (NYSE: SPOT) to enable the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFT</a> holders to unlock certain music creations on the online platform. According to the announcement, Moonbirds holders in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia, another few selected geographic regions can access Moonbirds playlist dubbed Sounds of a Digital Renaissance on the Spotify platform.</p>
<p>However, only Android Moonbirds users will access the pilot program, according to the announcement.</p>
<p>Reportedly, the Moonbirds developers see the partnership with Spotify as an opportunity to onboard Web2 to Web3 through the NFT industry. As a result, the NFT holders have a chance to unlock more utility while still holding their assets on the blockchain.</p>
<p>Notably, the Sounds of a Digital Renaissance was curated by Twitter user @dannylee, with the help of SongBirds, @TheSongBirds.</p>
<p>“This playlist will fuel the creative minds of our community and our artists, with multi-genre hits from artists such as Tame Impala, Diplo, and more,” Moonbirds <a href="https://twitter.com/moonbirds/status/1656711519986647041" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">noted</a>.</p>
<p>The Moonbirds team promised to keep building more utility for its NFT holders to enable value creation. Moreover, there are thousands of NFT projects in the entire blockchain industry all competing for the same markets.</p>
<h2>Moonbirds Economics</h2>
<p>According to market data provided by CoinGecko, the MOONBIRD NFTs had a floor price of 2.08000 ETH, worth approximately $3,673.92 on Friday, May 12. Additionally, the Moonbirds NFT project had a market capitalization of approximately 20,800 ETH, worth approximately $36,739,241, and a daily traded volume of about 80.47 ETH.</p>
<p>With about 10k unique digital assets, the Moonbirds project reported a total of 6,449 owners. Currently, the MOONBIRD NFTs are available for trading on <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/opensea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenSea</a> and LooksRare.</p>
<p>However, OpenSea had the majority of Moonbirds NFT volume in the past 24 hours.</p>
<h2>Spotify Taps on NFT to Broaden Its Market</h2>
<p>Earlier this year, the KINGSHIP NFT project, a subgroup of Board Apes signed to Universal Music Group (UMG), announced a strategic partnership with Spotify in a pilot program to help unlock certain playlists.</p>
<p>“All you need is a KINGSHIP Key Card NFT to unlock this playlist on Spotify. For now, this pilot is only available to Android users in the US, UK, DE, AU, and NZ,” the KINGSHIP <a href="https://twitter.com/therealkingship/status/1628484798648922113?s=46&amp;t=KhJnNBzOeYQ2WRnwTODjvA" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">noted</a>.</p>
<p>Similarly, the partnership with Kingship was only made available to Android users since Apple introduced some internal policies restricting the functionalities of NFTs.</p>
<p>The integration of Spotify with NFT projects including Moonbirds has helped its stock market rally more than 80 percent YTD. According to the latest stock market data, Spotify stock is trading at around $142.68, down 2.98 percent today.</p>

<p>Chinese chip powerhouse SMIC saw Q1 revenue fall to $1.46 billion as it continues to withstand chip shortages and US trade sanctions. </p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/smic-revenue-q1-2023/">SMIC Sustains 20.6% YoY Revenue Fall in Q1 2023 to Record First Income Deficit in Three Years</a></p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/smic-revenue-q1-2023/">SMIC Sustains 20.6% YoY Revenue Fall in Q1 2023 to Record First Income Deficit in Three Years</a></p>
<p>Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) has seen its revenue fall according to its latest quarterly figures. On Friday, the Chinese chipmaking giant posted revenue of $1.46 billion for Q1 2023 amid challenging macroeconomic parameters. In addition to being down 20.6% year-on-year (YoY), SMIC’s latest revenue haul represents the first income deficit in over three years. The last time the Shanghai-based semiconductor maker experienced a sales decline was in Q3 2019.</p>
<p>SMIC’s revenue fall also extended to its net profit, which plunged 48% YoY to $231.1 million. As mainland China’s largest contract chip maker, SMIC hopes to eventually catch up with regional rivals, especially Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/tsmc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TSMC</a>). However, SMIC’s ambitions to boost China’s domestic semiconductor industry suffered a setback when the company incurred US sanctions in 2020. At the time, Washington placed SMIC on a trade blacklist called Entity List, effectively cutting the leading East Asian chipmaker off from essential production resources. As a result, SMIC has struggled to manufacture more advanced, cutting-edge semiconductors competitively.</p>
<p>Despite production trailing TSMC and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/samsung/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samsung</a>, as well as constraints posed by US sanctions, SMIC <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/smic-2022-revenue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted record revenue</a> throughout last year. In February, the company reported a full-year 2022 revenue of $7.2 billion, representing a 34% increase from last year. Furthermore, SMIC saw a gross margin of 38%, its second year of sales growth above 30%.</p>
<h2>SMIC Exec Chalks Up Revenue Fall to Global Chip Shortage Also Affecting Other Semiconductor Players</h2>
<p>SMIC executives attributed the latest income drop to waning demand due to the sustained chip shortage. On an earnings call, the company’s co-chief executive Zhao Haijun admitted that prospects for recovery in the year’s second half remained unclear. SMIC’s declining earnings also came amid business and operational outlook revisions by other leading chip manufacturers such as TSMC and Samsung.</p>
<p>The impact of the global chip glut saw TSMC recently update its 2023 revenue forecast from slight growth to a lower single-digit decline. Meanwhile, US semiconductor powerhouse <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/intel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intel</a> (NASDAQ: INTC) anticipates a loss of 4 cents a share in Q2 2023. Intel’s grim outlook came after the Santa Clara-based company reported its <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/intel-q1-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most significant quarterly deficit</a> last month. However, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger remained optimistic at the time by focusing on bright spots in the chipmaker’s agenda. Emphasizing that Intel’s bleak first-quarter financial outing alluded to the company’s steady transformational progress, Gelsinger <a href="https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1615/intel-reports-first-quarter-2023-financial-results" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">explained</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“While we remain cautious on the macroeconomic outlook, we are focused on what we can control as we deliver on IDM 2.0: driving consistent execution across process and product roadmaps and advancing our foundry business to best position us to capitalize on the $1 trillion market opportunity ahead.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Intel’s chief financial officer David Zinsner also assessed its performance, explaining that it surpassed top and bottom line expectations. Furthermore, at the time, the CFO added that Intel remained committed to exercising discipline in expense management. Zinsner said the tech giant would continue driving efficiencies and cost savings.</p>

<p>Crypto trading data analyzer CryptoQuant recently weighed in on Bitcoin&#8217;s (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC</a>) price potential and appeal in 2023. In a media session, representatives from the crypto trading analyzer opined that more institutions could shore up on BTC later this year. The decentralized data provider&#8217;s reps also forecasted the prominent token returning to its previous record high by early 2024.</p>
<h2>CryptoQuant Says Bitcoin 2023 Price Trajectory Is Up</h2>
<p>In an <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/institutions-intend-to-buy-bitcoin-in-late-2023-interview-with-cryptoquant/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">interview with CryptoPotato</a>, CryptoQuant Head of BD &amp; Strategy Benjamin Brannan suggested 2023 as a prime time to buy Bitcoin. Brannan explained that the world&#8217;s largest crypto by market cap is essentially &#8220;out of the depths of the bear market&#8221;. Furthermore, the CryptoQuant executive added that despite the ever-present possibility of corrections, institutional clients look to invest in BTC in Q3 and Q4. Speaking on such indications received from sophisticated crypto investor hopefuls, Brannan explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;These are from conversations that I&#8217;ve been having mainly with institutional allocators and also people who are fundraising core funds as well. They&#8217;ve been speaking with various institutions or high net worth individuals.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>However, the CryptoQuant business developer stressed that institutions would likely only invest in Bitcoin and crypto in the second half of the year. This way, prospective investors can be sure that BTC has escaped the bear cycle. In Brannan&#8217;s opinion, Bitcoin already appears to be in full-scale bullish mode. He also touched on the crypto&#8217;s price correlation to gold, its place in the market cycle, and its role in the crumbling US banking situation.</p>
<h2>How US Banking Meltdown Has Driven Bitcoin Price Correlation to Gold Higher</h2>
<p>Bitcoin is currently changing hands over $26K, a substantial appreciation from the $16,500 where it began the year. Several analysts and observers, including Brannan, believe the crypto&#8217;s rally is primarily due to the ongoing banking crisis. According to consensus opinion, investors have fled the mainstream financial landscape in droves and repurposed their investments toward crypto assets. An increasing number of investors have viewed crypto as &#8216;safe haven&#8217; assets following the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate, and First Republic.</p>
<p>The development also sees a diminishing correlation between BTC and stocks and a surging correlation between crypto and gold. As of early April, the Bitcoin-to-gold correlation was 50%, surpassing the token&#8217;s 20% correlation to stocks. Furthermore, Bitcoin&#8217;s newfound risk-off asset status also reflects the popular digital currency&#8217;s increasing resilience to <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/federal-reserve-system-frs-what-it-is-and-how-it-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Reserve</a> interest rate hikes.</p>
<p>Although Bitcoin&#8217;s purported safe haven status seems unquestionable at the moment, Brannan sees the coin moving like a mixture of stocks and gold long-term-wise.</p>
<p>CryptoQuant Head of Marketing Ho Chan Chung also weighed in on the latest Bitcoin price development. According to Chung, crypto is viewed as a commodity that performs commendably when the fiat system stutters. Furthermore, the executive added that BTC&#8217;s status as a commodity in the US, instead of security, fuels its success.</p>
<p>Although Bitcoin&#8217;s infamous four-year-cycle bull and bear transitions based on its supply issuance schedule are well-documented, nailing the exact timing of highs and lows is tricky. However, Brannan believes there are some reliable indicators to identify bottoms. One such indicator is Market-Value to Realized-Value ratio (MVRV). This on-chain perspective divides an asset&#8217;s market capitalization by its realized capitalization.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-house-committee-sec-chair-gensler/">US House Committee on Financial Services Issues Ultimatum to SEC Chair Gensler</a></p>

<p>The US House Committee on Financial Services has given the Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>) Chair, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/gary-gensler/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gary Gensler</a>, an ultimatum to respond to its requests.</p>
<p>The committee is asking for access to internal documents concerning the SEC&#8217;s activities, especially about the agency&#8217;s proposed climate rule and charges against the former <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ftx-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a> CEO. Despite the congressional demands, Gensler had refused to provide the documents. Consequently, Congressman Bill Huizenga, Chairman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, <a href="https://huizenga.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=401606" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voiced his apprehensions</a> about the SEC&#8217;s lack of transparency and accountability.</p>
<p>Huizenga noted that it was inconceivable that the SEC was “struggling to process three requests from Congress in a timely and responsive manner” despite the manpower at its disposal. Despite the questions, the SEC Chairman stonewalled throughout the Capitol hearing.</p>
<h2>US House Committee: SEC Should Be More Transparent</h2>
<p>Apart from grilling Gensler about the SEC&#8217;s proposed climate rule, Huizenga also pressed Gensler for information about the charges against former FTX CEO <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/sam-bankman-fried/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>. Further, Congress asked for information from the SEC about its stance on cryptocurrency regulation.</p>
<p>Huizenga warned Gensler against using the Department of Justice as a shield to avoid further questioning. Already, there have been calls for Congress to subpoena the Commission to compel it to respond. This, according to various crypto community members, is because previous letters and hearings have not brought regulatory clarity to the crypto industry.</p>
<h2>What the Ultimatum Means for the SEC</h2>
<p>The ultimatum highlights the growing pressure on the SEC to take a more transparent approach to its regulatory activities. It also underlines the call for clearer and more concise guidelines for the industry.</p>
<p>Recall that Gensler has been under fire for suggesting that digital assets should be considered securities. The SEC chairman was billed to appear before Congress for his duplicitous stance on digital assets. </p>
<p>As crypto continues to evolve, regulators like the SEC need to keep up to protect investors and ensure market stability. The House Committee&#8217;s request for information shows that Congress is closely watching the SEC&#8217;s activities. It also suggests that Congressional oversight wants the regulator to act in the best interests of investors and the broader market.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/nbcu-yaccarino-twitter-ceo/">NBCU&#8217;s Linda Yaccarino Allegedly in Talks to Become Next Twitter CEO</a></p>
<p>According to Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/linda-yaccarino-in-talks-new-twitter-ceo-elon-musk-7a006bb5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a>, NBCU&#8217;s Head of Advertising <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/linda-yaccarino/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linda Yaccarino</a> is all set to become the next Chief Executive Officer of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/twitter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a>. The news comes hours after Elon Musk&#8217;s announcement via Twitter that he has appointed a new CEO.</p>
<p>Yaccarino, who devoted a major part of her life and career to WarnerMedia&#8217;s TV operations before joining NBCUniversal ten years ago, oversees the Comcast-owned firm&#8217;s ad-sales operations around the world.</p>
<p>In an article written on Yaccarino ten years ago, she was coined as the woman who wouldn&#8217;t do with &#8216;small steps&#8217;. Known for her strong negotiating skills, Liz Janeman, the then executive veep of advertising sales at Cabler Ovation, called her incredibly aggressive.</p>
<p>Yaccarino has recently led projects to produce new cash flows through e-commerce and worked to revamp the way the TV industry estimates its audiences for advertisers aspiring to offer more credibility. A spokesperson for NBCUniversal&#8217;s ad-sales business claimed that he wasn&#8217;t aware of any information about a change in Yaccarino&#8217;s status with the firm.</p>
<p>However, an individual aware of the recent proceedings suggested NBCU might have to rework the presentation because of Yaccarino&#8217;s possible release. The Madison Avenue expert is what Twitter needs today. Since the power shift to Elon Musk in October for $44 billion, the social media platform has lost advertisers as the CEO can not stop experimenting with its new features in real time.</p>
<p>Musk has withdrawn the blue-tick feature that confirms identities, only making them available if the customers pay extra for it. He has also offered new access to accounts that were initially banned for writing wrongful or offensive material.</p>
<p>However, there were speculations of other top executives who could be a good fit for the position. For example, Nada Stirratt, a veteran digital advertising executive who resigned from Facebook and has previously also worked with Viacom as well as News Corp and was the Chief Executive officer of Verve Mobile, was also considered as one of the leading names for the spot.</p>
<p>Yaccarino, over the recent months, has assisted Twitter in re-establishing its repertoire with advertising agencies. In April, she interviewed Musk at an industry event in Miami Beach, and NBCUniversal shook hands on an agreement with Twitter that will create content associated with the 2024 Paris Olympics available on the social site.</p>
<p>According to a former senior marketing executive at <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/bank-of-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bank of America</a> Lou Paskalis, Yaccarino has a great interest in Twitter and sees an opportunity there.</p>
<p>Her departure will open the discussion for the new ad-sales operation head. A possible successor was Laura Molen, who, however, exited the company last year. Rumors are rife that Mark Lazarus, the NBCU executive who supervises the firm&#8217;s streaming and TV businesses, could potentially overtake the ad-sales part.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/makerdao-ai-inspired-blockchain-roadmap/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/makerdao-ai-inspired-blockchain-roadmap/">MakerDAO Plots New AI-Inspired Blockchain, Publishes Roadmap</a></p>
<p>MakerDAO, the issuer of the DAI stablecoin, has revealed its plans for a major update it calls the “Endgame”, this follows after the platform recently <a href="https://forum.makerdao.com/t/the-5-phases-of-endgame/20830" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">published</a> a detailed roadmap of the upcoming update.</p>
<p>According to the May 11 announcement, the update will take place in five phases and will effect changes that will use artificial intelligence (AI) tools and ultimately lead to the creation of a new blockchain. Part of the publication reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The update will use AI tools and apply them to open and scalable processes.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>MakerDAO Seeks to Create the Most Widely-used Stablecoin</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, per the roadmap it published, MakerDAO is looking to ensure that the project creates the world&#8217;s most widely-used stablecoin in the next three years. To achieve this, Endgame will seek first to streamline the Maker Ecosystem by uniting the Maker governance token (MKR) and the Dai stablecoin (DAI).</p>
<p>MakerDAO co-founder Rune Christensen has also shed more light on the platform’s plans. According to him, the first phase of streamlining will be done under a new unified brand identity. And it is at this stage that the new unified tokens will also be released. Users, however, have the option to upgrade their old tokens or not.</p>
<p>The next phase will see Maker launch 6 new SubDAOs that can be farmed by users. Christensen says these SubDAOs will enable permissionless innovation and collateral allocation. With this plan, Maker hopes to remove costs and reduce complexities that may arise from daily operations<span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p>In the next phase, MakerDAO will introduce AI tools that will allow governance monitoring.  This is when users will be able to summarize and generate governance proposals, albeit with the aid of AI. It must be noted, however, that only those who hold Maker’s new tokens will have access to this feature.</p>
<p>The fifth will see MakerDAO introduce incentives for partaking in governance. And, lastly, it will launch a new blockchain in the sixth stage. According to Christensen, the new blockchain called NewChain will be closely linked with <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a>, promising increased governance security of the ecosystem.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/tesla-shares-gains-musk-twitter/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/tesla-shares-gains-musk-twitter/">Tesla Shares Print Mild Gains as Elon Musk Is Set to Step Down as Twitter CEO</a></p>
<p>The shares of American multinational technology company <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/tesla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tesla Inc</a> (NASDAQ: TSLA) are seeing an impressive uptick as investors appear elated that the company’s Chief Executive Officer, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/elon-musk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elon Musk</a> is setting his priorities right. As <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/elon-musk-steps-down-twitter-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> earlier by Coinspeaker, the iconic entrepreneur and founder said he is stepping down from his role as the CEO of Twitter, the micro-messaging platform he acquired more than a year ago.</p>
<p>The announcement from Musk detailed that the new CEO is set to resume office in about 6 weeks while his own role will be relegated to Executive Chairman and CTO. As an engineer that he is, Musk said he will now be overseeing the product, software and sysops for the company.</p>
<p>While there are different reactions to the revelations from the Twitter CEO with many applauding the move. However, the concerns as to what the future of the company will be like under the new CEO remains a major source of speculation, however, for Tesla investors and shareholders, this is a welcome development.</p>
<p>The Tesla stakeholders have been concerned that there has been a lot of distraction for Musk who is joggling affairs between Tesla, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/spacex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SpaceX</a>, and Twitter. While these companies are at the forefront of his agenda, he is also overseeing The Boring Company and Neuralink, a move that Tesla’s shareholders believe is making him not focus on the immediate challenges of the electric car company.</p>
<p>&#8220;Corporate boards can and should intervene if a chief executive appears to be distracted or overly focused on other ventures. Yet, the Board has permitted Elon Musk to run multiple companies, leading to an inability to address the multiple strategic and competitive issues facing Tesla,&#8221; a group of Tesla shareholders expressed their concerns about Musk’s divided attention in a <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d374de8aae9940001c8ed59/t/644298578c858b5963c7a411/1682085975961/TSLA+23_Board+letter_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letter</a>.</p>
<h2>Tesla Shares and the New Growth Track</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Tesla shares are up by 0.96% in the pre-market, an uptick that compliments the more than 2% upsurge from the Thursday trading session.</p>
<p>This growth in Tesla shares may indicate a new dawn for the stock that has been greatly devalued over the past year.</p>
<p>Musk wants to hand over the reins of affairs to an entirely new figure who is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/linda-yaccarino-in-talks-new-twitter-ceo-elon-musk-7a006bb5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">tipped</a> to be Linda Yaccarino, the Chairman of Global Advertising and Partnerships at NBCUniversal. By speculations, the role of Linda is expected to supersede that of Musk in the day-to-day administration of the firm, giving the Chairman more time for his other ventures.</p>
<p>The biggest beneficiary of this move in the long term will be Tesla shareholders, considering the firm is the only publicly listed entity tied to Elon Musk. By outlook, Tesla will seek to start gradually recouping the more than $600 billion it has lost in its market capitalization since Musk’s acquisition of the social media firm was finalized.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-us-changpeng-zhao-regulatory/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-us-changpeng-zhao-regulatory/">Binance.US Explores Reducing Stake of Changpeng Zhao amid US Regulatory Crackdown</a></p>
<p>As per the recent development, crypto exchange Binance.US along with its founder Changpeng Zhao is looking at ways to reduce his stake in the company amid a strong crackdown by the United States federal regulatory authorities.</p>
<p>Currently, CZ is the majority stakeholder currently in Binance.US, as reported by The Information citing sources familiar with the matter. As we know, over the past year, Binance.US along with <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/changpeng-zhao/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Changepeng Zhao</a> has been facing major scrutiny from the US federal regulators.</p>
<p>Earlier this year in March, the US Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CFTC</a>) sued Binance.US along with its founder CZ for operating an &#8220;illegal&#8221; exchange running on a &#8220;sham&#8221; compliance program.</p>
<p>The commodities regulator said that Binance and its top executive CZ have been involved with the &#8220;willful evasion&#8221; of US laws,  “while engaging in a calculated strategy of regulatory arbitrage to their commercial benefit”. The <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/binance-us-explores-ways-to-cut-founder-changpeng-zhaos-majority-stake" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a> from The Information adds that since then, the leaders at Binance.US have been discussing how reducing Zhao&#8217;s stake could help in actually improving the standing in the eyes of the US regulators.</p>
<p>The executives at Binance.US worry that since Zhao has been named in the lawsuit by the CFTC, the company might not be able to acquire certain regulatory licenses that it wants in the US, as long as CZ continues as the majority owner of the platform.</p>
<h3>Binance Takes Corrective Measures</h3>
<p>Responding to the lawsuit by the US CFTC, crypto exchange Binance said that they have been maintaining regulatory compliance. The crypto exchange stated that it has implemented a robust ‘three lines of defense’ approach to risk and compliance, in an attempt to address the current regulatory concerns.</p>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is pursuing a permanent ban on trading and registration for <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> due to its alleged failure to control potential illicit transactions. Since July 2019, Binance has supposedly provided and executed commodity derivatives transactions for US customers. CFTC has stated that Binance&#8217;s compliance program has not been effective, and its employees and clients have been directed to bypass compliance controls to maximize corporate profits. CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam <a href="https://www.blockhead.co/2023/03/28/cftc-sues-says-compliance-efforts-at-binance-a-sham/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“For years, Binance knew they were violating CFTC rules, working actively to keep the money flowing and avoid compliance. This should be a warning to anyone in the digital asset world that the CFTC will not tolerate willful avoidance of US law.”</p></blockquote>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/taboo-valuation-250m-10m-funding/">TABOO Pushes Its Valuation to $250M Following $10M Funding Round</a></p>
<p>TABOO, an adult entertainment platform, has raised a sum of $10 million in funding as it seeks expansion of its service offering using the power of blockchain technology. According to a press release shared with Coinspeaker, TABOO is now valued at $250 million following the funding round.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, the funding round for TABOO was led by a private family office headed by a former senior executive from American multinational investment banking giant <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/jpmorgan-chase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co</a> (NYSE: JPM). The funding will serve multiple purposes in helping to reposition TABOO as the high-growth platform that it is designed to be.</p>
<p>The cash injection will be specifically pushed to boost the platform’s growth, improve its products, and enhance security measures. Additionally, it will be used to boost marketing efforts and pursue strategic acquisitions that can help in expanding the brand of the adult content platform.</p>
<p>That blockchain technology can be used to revitalize any industry is a fact that has been proven with many innovative decentralized applications that have been launched over the past few years. TABOO is designed to take care of a rather less penetrated industry in Web 3.0.</p>
<p>As a content creation platform, TABOO uses blockchain and<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-non-fungible-token/#:~:text=A%20non%2Dfungible%20token%20refers,proofs%20of%20authenticity%20and%20ownership." target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Non-Fungible Tokens</a> (NFT) to redefine curation and distribution. With the right capital base that it now boasts of, TABOO will explore new innovations that will help it expand its global market share while competing favorably.</p>
<p>The support for the digital currency and project by investors is a recognition of the unique fundamentals driving the platform which also translates to a viable stake in a protocol that has a ready market.</p>
<p>“We are excited to partner with TABOO and support its growth in the adult entertainment industry. We see tremendous value in the platform and the doors it will open for TABOO to get listed on all top exchanges and create a global legacy,” a spokesperson for the Family office said.</p>
<h2>TABOO Funding: a Boost for the Token</h2>
<p>The TABOO token was designed to serve as a major utility token to help every user of the platform to get the most utility from using the services. TABOO as a digital currency is set to benefit more from the funding round as the publicity the capital raise has introduced has made it gain more popularity among Web 3.0 users.</p>
<p>While it remains one of the digital currencies that has been well battered by the crypto winter, having touched a high of $600 million valuation at its peak, investors can be assured of the stability and long-term prospects for growth for the digital currency. With the target market and unending demand for its products, the founding team is optimistic the project can live up to its expectations in the long term.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to have secured this funding, which will enable us to take TABOO to the next level,” said James, the CEO of TABOO further emphasized: “We believe that blockchain and NFTs are the future of adult entertainment, and we are determined to lead the way. This investment allows us to do just that and become a household name.”<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/blockfi-custodial-300m-repayment/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

<p>A judge has approved repayment for BlockFi custodial wallet holders but said interest-bearing funds still belong to the bankrupt company. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/blockfi-custodial-300m-repayment/">BlockFi Custodial Customers to Receive $300M in Repayment, While BIA Holders Risk Losing Investment to Company&#8217;s Creditors</a></p>
<p>BlockFi custodial wallet users could receive a massive $300 million repayment from the bankrupt digital asset lender. On Thursday, a New Jersey judge ruled that the assets locked in BlockFi&#8217;s custodial accounts belong to clients rather than the company&#8217;s estate. However, the judge further ruled that another $375 million that users sought to transfer from interest-bearing accounts following November&#8217;s withdrawal suspension still belong to BlockFi.</p>
<p>As Judge Michael Kaplan <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/blockfi-custodial-account-300-million/amp/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">put</a> it:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The court finds that all digital assets held by the debtors in custodial omnibus wallets are indeed client property and not the property of the bankruptcy estates, subject, of course, to possible avoidance and clawback rights.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, Judge Kaplan&#8217;s less-than-welcome address to BlockFi interest-bearing (BIA) holders <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/05/11/blockfi-customers-can-be-repaid-300m-held-in-custodial-accounts-judge-says/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">read</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;No transfer requests by customers between the BIA and the custodial wallet accounts initiated after 8.15 pm on November 10th, 2022, were effectuated and completed. BIA account holders deposited their assets into these accounts with the full knowledge that they were undertaking certain risks in exchange for the chance of greater returns.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Details of BlockFi Bankruptcy Case</h2>
<p>Kaplan stressed his BIA ruling despite BlockFi&#8217;s user front-end seemingly confirming the successful transfer of funds back to customers. The bankruptcy judge spared custodial wallet holders from the same fate as BIA customers because [custodials] &#8220;did not share this risk or return.&#8221; As a result, custodial ownership of non-estate property should not be diluted by &#8220;those who took on such risks&#8221;.</p>
<p>Bankruptcy laws support the immediate return of funds belonging to customers rather than having said funds divided up among the company&#8217;s estate&#8217;s creditors. In BlockFi&#8217;s case, custodial repayment was delayed by a dispute over funds held in the company&#8217;s interest-bearing accounts. Customers had attempted to liquidate these funds after November 10th following the suspension of withdrawals and transfers. BlockFi&#8217;s BIA holders also tried another transfer on November 18th when the crypto lender instituted corresponding changes in the app.</p>
<p>In early November, BlockFi froze the funds in its interest-bearing accounts as ripples from the collapse of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ftx-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a> permeated the crypto ecosystem. The New Jersey-based digital asset lender ultimately <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/blockfi-chapter-11-bankruptcy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy</a> on November 28th – a few weeks after the FTX crash.</p>
<h2>BIA Customer Attorney Argues for Same Favorable Repayment Treatment of Clients as Custodial Wallet Holders</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, before BlockFi&#8217;s present bankruptcy court BIA ruling, an attorney representing the affected customers had disapproved of perceived repayment optics.</p>
<p>At a Monday hearing, Deborah Kovsky-Apap of Troutman Pepper argued for including her BIA clients in any repayment schemes. Kovsky-Apap pointed out that her clients all attempted to transfer BIA holdings during the interim period between November 10th and 18th. The attorney said disregarding the &#8220;plain language of the terms of service&#8221; that promises instant transactions would be unfair. In addition, Kovsky-Apap suggested that BlockFi was discriminatory in its treatment of customers who all faced the same situation.</p>
<p>BlockFi trial lawyer and representative Michael B. Slade said the company had yet to complete its assets&#8217; sales in other developments. Slade&#8217;s revelation came amid reports that some clients received email confirmation validating said assets&#8217; sales.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitcoin-27000-us-regulatory/" rel="prev">next</a></p>
