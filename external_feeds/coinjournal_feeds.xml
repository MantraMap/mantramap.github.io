										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Casper price is down 2% in the past 24 hours, action that mirrors broader market sentiment.</li>
<li dir="ltr">CSPR rose to $0.063 in April.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The technical picture signals continued strength despite the latest dip.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">CSPR, the native governance token of Casper Network, is down 2% in the past 24 hours and up roughly 1.5% in the past week. According to CoinGecko, 30-day gains stand at around 3.2% as of July 29 at 11 am ET, with CSPR changing hands near $0.039.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The daily trading volume has fallen by about 36% in the past 24 hours to suggest reduced network activity, data shows. Given these details, what&rsquo;s the price outlook of Casper&rsquo;s native token?</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">CRPR price outlook: key developments</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Casper is an L1 proof-of-stake blockchain based on Correct-By-Construction (CBC) consensus specification and targeted for institutional and enterprise clients.</p>
<p dir="ltr">From a broader crypto market perspective, Casper&rsquo;s price performance over the month aligns with recent struggles for mega caps. <a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> has found it difficult to break above $30k and currently hovers near $29.3k, while Ethereum&rsquo;s attempts to reclaim $1,900 have been rejected multiple times.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Even XRP, which outperformed the top altcoins by a big margin after <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/ripple/">Ripple&rsquo;s win</a> against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has pared more than half the gains seen on July 13 when it soared over 100%. XRP is down 8% in the past seven days.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As noted, Casper has traded lower in recent days. However, with sentiment across the industry largely bullish, a return to key levels is likely to catalyse more gains for hodlers. The blockchain platform&rsquo;s growth metrics remain positive, particularly after a recent <a href="https://casper.network/en-us/news/inx-partnership" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">partnership</a> with US-based regulated broker-dealer INX.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The collaboration will see Casper Labs&rsquo; equity tokenized and listed for trading on secondary markets. The firm expects this to be rolled out in September 2023. Other notable events are the recent announcements around update to the Casper Wallet and integration with fiat-to-crypto onramp Topper.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Investors are buoyed by the developments, which could see more adoption and demand for CSPR and potentially boost its price.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">CSPR price &ndash; technical outlook</h2>
<p dir="ltr">As the chart below shows, the technical outlook for CSPR suggests bulls still have the upper hand. Buyers are likely to seize control if prices break above the resistance area marked by the trendline (red).&nbsp;</p>
<div class="fr-img-space-wrap"><span class="fr-img-caption fr-fic fr-dib" style="width: 600px"><span class="fr-img-wrap"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/06/29/1690648345645-1c84c011-888c-440a-8ecc-8c998447cc86.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="277"><span class="fr-inner"><span>Casper Network price chart showing CSPR performance on the daily chart. Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/q5KPX6nq/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TradingView</a></span></span></span></span></div>
<p dir="ltr">The daily RSI is supportive of this as it holds the trajectory seen following the CSPR/USD breakout on July 21. The MACD indicator is also highlighting growing strength.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If price holds above the 50-day EMA, it could continue towards $0.046 and the primary hurdle at $0.053. Above this is the year-to-date highs of $0.063 reached in April.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the downside, the main support level lies around $0.035.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul class="decimal_type">
<li>Fed&rsquo;s July decision did not impact the cryptocurrency market</li>
<li>Despite rallying in 2023, ADA/USD dipped below the 2022 lows</li>
<li>A double bottom pattern might be in place, and a move above $0.55 would confirm the reversal pattern</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Three central banks announced their interest rate decisions this week, and the Federal Reserve was one of them. For those trading cryptocurrencies denominated in US dollars, the Fed&rsquo;s decision marked one of the most important events of the summer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the decision to &ldquo;skip&rdquo; a rate hike in June, the Fed signaled that it would hike the rates in July, despite the clear improvements in the fight against inflation. Accordingly, the market priced in a rate hike, and the Fed delivered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As such, all the attention was on what the Fed will signal moving forward &ndash; more tightening or the fact that it had reached the terminal rate? Every detail was important for the US dollar as its volatility directly impacts cryptocurrency traders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As it turned out, the Fed did hike the funds rate by another 25 basis points and did not signal that the current cycle ended. Therefore, the outcome of the Fed&rsquo;s meeting might be viewed as hawkish for the US dollar, and so, it is no wonder that the cryptocurrency market continued its consolidation and experienced less volatility following the Fed meeting than the traditional currency market.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/06/29/1690647647616-015d57e0-3184-46cf-8a82-c654f5b00e2c.jpg" style="width: 1800px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="1800" height="468"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ADAUSD/?exchange=CRYPTO" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cardano chart by TradingView</a></p>
<h2>ADA/USD unable to break above horizontal resistance</h2>
<p>Cardano (ADA) rallied in 2023 as Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies bounced from their 2022 lows. In doing so, the market met little or no resistance until the $0.4 area. This is an area where ADA/USD found support in the past, and now support turned into resistance.</p>
<p>For several months now, ADA/USD was not able to break and hold above resistance &ndash; every time sellers emerged. So heavy was the selling pressure that the market even dropped below the 2022 lows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naturally, this week&rsquo;s Fed decision was important because it might be that ADA/USD formed a double bottom with the last attempt to the lows. While the Fed&rsquo;s decision did not trigger a lower dollar, the bias remains somehow bullish for ADA/USD because of the possible double bottom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, if ADA/USD climbs above $0.4, more buyers might step in to trade the pattern&rsquo;s measured move, seen in orange above. It points to $0.55, and on such a market move, the bearish bias might finally be left behind.&nbsp;</p>

<li dir="ltr">Shiba Inu wallet addresses with 10 million to 100 billion added 1.11 trillion SHIB since June 4.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The increased whale activity comes amid bullish sentiment for Shiba Inu ahead of its Shibarium launch.</li>
<li dir="ltr">SHIB price was slightly higher on Saturday, trading around $0.00000830.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/shiba-inu/">Shiba Inu</a> is among altcoins to see a significant surge in their prices over the past week, with the meme coin largely benefitting from whale activity.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to on-chain data from market intelligence platform Santiment, large holders have accumulated staggering amounts of SHIB since early June. &nbsp;This spike in whale activity comes ahead of a highly anticipated Shiba Inu ecosystem event &ndash; the launch of the layer-2 solution Shibarium.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While only testnet access is available for now, the huge anticipation surrounding Shibarium is one of the factors driving interest in the meme coin.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Shiba Inu whales gorge on SHIB</h2>
<p dir="ltr">As Santiment <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1685041009728843776" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shared</a> on Friday, large Shina Inu <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/wallets/">wallets</a> in the category of &ldquo;sharks&rdquo; and &ldquo;dolphins&rdquo; have added more than $9 million worth of SHIB over the past two or so months.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Indeed, on-chain data indicates addresses with 10 million to 100 billion SHIB have accumulated 1.11 trillion of the meme token since June 4. The total SHIB holdings in the hands of these large investors stood at $32.49 trillion on Friday, July 28. In total, this group holds roughly $266 million worth of SHIB.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here&rsquo;s Santiment&rsquo;s chart showing the increased SHIB accumulation by 10 million to 100 billion address cohort.</p>

<p>CoinGecko ranks Shiba Inu the 15th largest cryptocurrency by market cap, with this at over $4.9 billion at the time of writing.</p>

</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Kannagi Finance, a revenue aggregator protocol on zkSync Era, has reportedly rugpulled. Users have suffered major losses, while the price of the native token KANA has nosedived.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The protocol&rsquo;s official website has allegedly &ldquo;expired&rdquo;. Meanwhile, its social media channels, including the official Twitter account are inaccessible. Total value locked (TVL) has plummeted from $2.13 million on Friday to near zero this morning, putting users losses at over $2 million.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">TVL plunged to near zero</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Kannagi Finance is said to have had its audit on June 6, handled by SolidProof, an audit agency under Germany-based Make Network. However, the protocol&rsquo;s <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/smart-contracts/">smart contract</a> code remained closed-source and unverified.</p>

<li>Solana based Aurory has expanded to Arbitrum, a leading L2 for Ethereum.</li>
<li>$1 million in AURY liquidity has been added to the Arbitrum native DEX Camelot.</li>
<li>AURY price surged more than 22% to hit highs of $1.00.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Aurory, a leading NFT and gaming project in the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/solana/">Solana</a> ecosystem, is seeing fresh adoption after it announced expansion to <a href="https://coinjournal.net/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> Layer-2 protocol Arbitrum.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to the platform, expanding to Arbitrum is all about accessibility and bringing more users to the gaming platform.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>Using SyncSpace to expand Aurory to multiple platforms allows us to tap into diverse new user bases, creating frictionless onramps for these communities, regardless of whether they are Web2, or Web3 native</em>,&rdquo; the Aurory team <a href="https://twitter.com/AuroryProject/status/1683898723284275200" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The integration means that all of Aurory&rsquo;s on-chain assets are now accessible on either Solana or Arbitrum. Users on the Arbitrum network can get AURY by depositing USDC into SyncSpace, then swapping the stablecoin for AURY.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As a native token, AURY can be used across the Aurory ecosystem. The teams announced that $1 million of AURY liquidity had been seeded on Arbitrum native DEX Camelot.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Aurory&rsquo;s availability on Ethereum marks a first major milestone for the gaming platform and could be followed by more expansions to leading chains like BNB, Polygon and Avalanche.

<p dir="ltr">IIn latest <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/cryptocurrency/">crypto news</a>, France&rsquo;s privacy watchdog is reportedly examining legal issues around recently launched Worldcoin (WLD), particularly its biometric data collection.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to a Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/frances-privacy-watchdog-says-worldcoin-legality-seems-questionable-2023-07-28/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> on July 28, the Commission nationale de l&rsquo;informatique et des libert&eacute;s (CNIL), had indicated it has questions over Worldcoin&rsquo;s requirements that include users scan their irises using an orb.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The CNIL has said it opened investigations after Worldcoin collected data from users in France, per details published in the Reuters report.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Worldcoin offers access to a digital ID and free cryptocurrency (in countries where regulation allows) to people who sign up to a &ldquo;proof of personhood.&rdquo; Data shows the project created by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has seen increased sign ups since its launch on Monday.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Key takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Memu&rsquo;s presale has generated more than $1.2 million in its first month.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">SHMU&rsquo;s price is increased daily, with the presale set to last for eight weeks.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency market has underperformed this week. Bitcoin has lost more than 2% of its value in the last seven days and is now trading below $30k. At press time, the&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>price of Bitcoin</u></a> stands at $29,212.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite the market&rsquo;s poor performance, Shiba Memu&rsquo;s presale has hit a new milestone. The presale has surpassed the $1 million mark in the first month of its presale.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What is Shiba Memu?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">AI has become the rage in the world now. Following the launch of ChatGPT earlier this year, we have seen a number of AI solutions crop up to solve numerous problems within society.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Shiba Memu</u></a> is a project that is taking advantage of AI and blockchain technology to make it easier for people to create content and market their services.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to their whitepaper, Shiba Memu is designed to handle the task of 100 marketing agencies. The Shiba Memu machine is always active and is working 24/7 to find the best work going on in creative advertising, consuming it and generating better content marketing.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Memu is launching a meme token thanks to the explosive growth recorded by meme coins in recent years. In 2020, meme coins were practically unknown in the crypto ecosystem but grew to a market cap of over $20 billion within two years.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, Shiba Memu could be better than most of the meme coins currently available in the crypto market, thanks to its utility. The team explained that Shiba Memu has self-sufficient marketing capabilities powered by AI technology, making it a unique and attractive investment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With Shiba Memu, users have a powerful AI that can create its own marketing strategies, write its own PR, and promote itself in relevant forums and social networks. Currently, Shiba Memu is available on the Ethereum and BNBChain blockchains.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Shiba Memu&rsquo;s presale tops $1.2M</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Shiba Memu</u></a> is becoming quite popular amongst cryptocurrency investors despite the recent bearish sentiment in the market.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The presale has been on for less than a month, and the team has raised $1.2 million so far. The development team will use the funds to develop some of its products.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Most of the funds generated from the presale would be used to develop Shiba Memu&rsquo;s AI technology. With the Shiba Memu AI technology, the platform can engage with users directly.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The development team added that the platform would have a robotastic dashboard to interact with the AI, provide feedback, make suggestions, and ask questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Click here</u></a> to find out more about Shiba Memu&rsquo;s presale event.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Shiba Memu price prediction</h2>
<p dir="ltr">It is hard to accurately predict Shiba Memu&rsquo;s price as the token is still in its presale phase. Currently, 1 SHMU = 0.016300 USDT.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The team revealed that the&nbsp;<a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Shiba Memu</u></a> price increases every day at 6 pm GMT. In a few hours, the token will go for 0.016525 USDT.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">SHMU began trading at $0.011125 when the presale began and will trade at $0.0244 when the presale ends. Users can purchase the SHMU token using Ethereum, USDT, BNB and BUSD</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Should you invest in Shiba Memu now?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">If you are interested in the project, then it is not too late to invest in Shiba Memu. the project&rsquo;s utility could make it one of the leading meme coins in the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">By combing AI and blockchain technology to ease marketing strategies for companies and organisations, Shiba Memu could gain massive adoption in the coming months and years.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">If the project gets the necessary adoption, SHMU, the native token of the&nbsp;<a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Shiba Memu</u></a> ecosystem, could record massive gains in the medium to long term.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Furthermore, if the broader crypto market enters a bullish cycle, SHMU could emerge as one of the biggest winners. Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies are up by more than 40% year-to-date.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">If the market fundamentals improve over the next few months, SHMU could record excellent growth once it starts trading on cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>

<li>Crypto.com has earned approvals from seven other regulatory bodies in the recent past.</li>
<li>The exchange&rsquo;s approval in the Netherlands comes weeks after Binance withdrew its license application.</li>
<li>Crypto.com seems to be beating its main competitor Binance in regulatory approvals around the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>The well-known cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com has made history by obtaining authorization for registration from the Dutch Central Bank (DNB) to provide its services in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Following careful adherence to the nation&rsquo;s Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Prevention) Act, Crypto.com received the DNB&rsquo;s approval, demonstrating the exchange&rsquo;s commitment to upholding strict regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>This accomplishment, according to CEO Kris Marszalek, is a turning point for the company&rsquo;s service and demonstrates the exchange&rsquo;s commitment to cooperating closely with regulators to advance the industry responsibly.</p>
<h2>Crypto.com regulatory approvals around the world</h2>
<p>The latest endorsement for Crypto.com by the Dutch regulatory body adds to a long list of worldwide endorsements. The Monetary Authority of Singapore, as previously reported <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/crypto-com-completes-its-licensing-process-in-singapore/">here</a>, and the UK&rsquo;s Financial Conduct Authority, as previously <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/crypto-com-secures-approval-as-a-crypto-asset-business-from-uks-fca/">reported here</a>, are among seven other regulatory bodies that have already approved the exchange.</p>
<p>The exchange has improved its standing as a trustworthy player in the cryptocurrency industry thanks to its outstanding success in navigating challenging regulatory environments and obtaining required certifications. Notably, Crypto.com recently acquired a regulatory licence in Spain, underscoring its unwavering commitment to upholding legal requirements.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Crypto.com wants to strengthen its relationships with EU authorities in anticipation of the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/european-parliament-finally-adopts-the-markets-in-crypto-assets-act-mica/">Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA)</a> regulations that will change how EU countries deal with the cryptocurrency industry. By taking a proactive stance, Crypto.com is positioned to play a significant role in influencing the European crypto industry&rsquo;s future.</p>
<h2>Crypto.com in the Netherlands</h2>
<p>With each new regulatory approval, Crypto.com cements its position as a leading and trusted cryptocurrency exchange, bolstering investor confidence and opening up exciting possibilities for further expansion. As the crypto market continues to evolve, the exchange&rsquo;s dedication to compliance stands as a beacon of reliability, attracting both seasoned and novice investors.</p>
<p>Crypto.com&rsquo;s clearance by the Dutch Central Bank underscores the exchange&rsquo;s exceptional commitment to compliance and responsible practices. The company&rsquo;s growing list of approvals from various global regulatory bodies positions Crypto.com at the forefront of the crypto industry&rsquo;s transformation.</p>
