Kumar discussed the role of crypto in Walmart’s future:</p><p>With the emerging technology, Kumar aims to make payment options friction-free for customers who want to transact. Kumar believes that the payments disruptions will begin in terms of different payment methods and different payment options.</p><p><i>"Crypto will continue to play a significant role in that. And obviously, we want to be there where the customer really needs us to be. So whether it is physical or virtual goods, it plays a part in what the customer wants." </i>says Kumar.</p><p>The CTO also noted that a large number of customers will be approached through the Metaverse and other live streams on social media apps, and that crypto could be an important payment option in such areas.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Retail in the metaverse...</h3><p>Last month, Walmart made its debut on Roblox Worlds as a testing ground for the metaverse. Walmart created “Walmart Land” and “Walmart’s Universe of Play” within Roblox.</p><p>Earlier this year, Walmart took a leap into blockchain technology to create an automated process for handling invoices and payments of its 70 third-party freight carriers. By using blockchain, Walmart has eliminated its issues of incompatible enterprise systems by replacing them with a shared single source of credible information for Walmart and its carriers.</p><div><i style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; text-align: center;">---------------<br /><b>Author:&nbsp;</b>Oliver Redding<br /></i><i style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span><span style="color: #cc0000;">Seattle Newsdesk&nbsp;</span></span><span style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;">&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.globalcryptopress.com/" style="backface-visibility: hidden; box-sizing: border-box; cursor: pointer; display: inline; margin: 0px; text-decoration-line: none; touch-action: manipulation;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;">Breaking Crypto News</span></a></span></span></span></i><br /></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/GlobalCryptoPress" title="Subscribe to our feed" rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml"><img src="//feedburner.google.com/fb/images/pub/feed-icon32x32.png" alt="" style="border:0"/></a><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/GlobalCryptoPress" title="Subscribe to our feed" rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml">Subscribe to GCP in a reader</a></div>
