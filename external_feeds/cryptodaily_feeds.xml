			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">U.S. bankruptcy judge Brendan Shannon has approved cryptocurrency exchange Bittrex's request for a $7 million loan in Bitcoin (BTC) from its parent company, Aquila Holdings, according to a Reuters report on May 10. The loan aims to facilitate the smooth running of the company's bankruptcy process without disrupting its customers.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">According to a report from Reuters, Bittrex will be allowed to borrow 250 BTC, currently valued at $7 million. The exchange also plans to request an additional 450 BTC loan in a June hearing, which could bring the total value of the loans to $19 million if Bitcoin's price remains stable. Bittrex asserts that it can pay back all its customers in cryptocurrency, but the loan will help ensure the bankruptcy process proceeds without complications.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Judge Shannon agreed to the Bitcoin loan due to the cryptocurrency's unique features, such as low interest rates and built-in volatility protections. Bittrex will not be required to repay more than 110% of Bitcoin's current value when the loan is due.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The loan comes after Bittrex announced its decision to file for U.S. bankruptcy on May 8 without ceasing its global operations. The company cited regulatory challenges and reported its assets and liabilities to be between $500 million and $1 billion, with over 100,000 creditors. Bittrex's trading volume in the past 24 hours stands at $7.2 million.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The bankruptcy filing comes in the wake of the U.S. Securities and Exchanbge Commission (SEC) charging Bittrex for operating an unregistered securities exchange. As a result, Bittrex stopped accepting new deposits from U.S. customers and advised existing users to withdraw their crypto from the platform. The company's U.S. operations accounted for a minority of its overall user base, with affiliated exchanges in Liechtenstein and Bermuda representing about 77% of its 5.4 million users as of March 27, according to court documents.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Bittrex's attorney, Susheel Kirpalani, emphasized during the court hearing that the bankruptcy loan would ensure a seamless wind-down of the company while protecting customer assets. The loan, granted on an interim basis, allows Bittrex to borrow 250 Bitcoin from its non-bankrupt parent company Aquila Holdings. The total value of the proposed loan could reach $19.7 million, based on Bitcoin prices at the time of the bankruptcy filing.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Judge Shannon's approval of the loan, despite it being a "novel currency," was influenced by the favorable terms compared to other bankruptcy loans, including a relatively low 4% interest rate and built-in protections related to Bitcoin's price volatility. Bittrex intends to repay the loan in Bitcoin, with a provision that it will not be forced to pay more than 110% of Bitcoin's current value if it must acquire more Bitcoin to make loan repayments, as stated in the court documents.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>London, United Kingdom, May 10th, 2023, Chainwire</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, PUBLC announced the paradigm-shifting integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into its search engine, a transformative move that firmly positions the startup as a pioneer in the rapidly evolving search industry. This milestone follows PUBLC's ongoing mission to create "everyone's search engine" &ndash; a platform built by the web community, powered by cutting-edge AI models, and anchored in a blockchain-based token economy through its token, PUBLX.</p>
<p>Since the release of ChatGPT 6 months ago, the world has witnessed the revolutionary capabilities of LLMs, prompting tech giants like Google and Microsoft to rush to incorporate them into their products. Today, PUBLC stands out as the first search engine to fully integrate LLMs into its core search logic. This integration allows every search query on PUBLC to be processed by the LLM, which retrieves relevant data and sources, delivering answers and insights in natural language. These features further enhance PUBLC's unique experience by offering users a more engaging, personalized, and visual approach to searching, discovering, and consuming web content.</p>
<p>The integration is also in line with PUBLC's community-driven approach, which combines advanced AI models with human intelligence. This approach envisions a system where every user can contribute to training the Language Models, following a methodology similar to Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) used in the development of ChatGPT. Drawing inspiration from collaborative models like Wikipedia, PUBLC aims to engage millions of users worldwide in organizing web content, transforming it into an invaluable resource for answers on any topic or niche.</p>
<p>Committed to creating a search engine that belongs to and rewards the web community, PUBLC challenges the status quo wherein tech giants such as Google, Meta and Amazon dominate global ad revenue, leaving little for the broader web ecosystem. To address this imbalance, PUBLC has implemented a tokenized revenue model that distributes 90% of the platform's revenue among its community using its Ethereum blockchain-based token, PUBLX. This blockchain-based economic model is tied to the platform's fiat-based revenue streams, like advertising, giving the token real value and fostering ongoing growth and collaboration. This economic model lays the foundation for a new web economy that rewards users, creators, content platforms, celebrities, developers, and other participants, giving them the value they rightfully deserve.</p>
<p>As a next step, PUBLC will open-source its AI layer, developed on the popular LLM framework, LangChain, while actively embracing the expanding LLM developer community. By doing so, PUBLC will enable developers worldwide to contribute to its AI models and receive rewards through its token model. PUBLC invites LLM developers, open-source projects, and communities to join its mission of creating an open-source LLM project that serves the web ecosystem.</p>
Lior Davidovitch, Founder and CEO of PUBLC, said: &ldquo;This launch represents PUBLC's most significant milestone to date. As a modern-day David versus Goliath, our small team has been dedicated to building this ambitious vision layer by layer over the past few years, aiming to revolutionize the search industry and compete with the world's largest companies. This is just the start, and we plan to launch many features and initiatives in the upcoming months to support our community. We call the web community of users, creators, brands and developers to join us on this mission of creating a search engine that genuinely belongs to everyone.&rdquo;&nbsp;
<p>About PUBLC</p>
<p>PUBLC is on a mission to revolutionize the search industry by creating "everyone's search engine" &ndash; a platform that is collaboratively built by the web community, powered by state-of-the-art AI models, and anchored in a blockchain-based token economy that benefits the entire web ecosystem.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Crypto exchange Binance debuts &lsquo;Capital Connect,&rsquo; a new platform that links institutional investors with crypto fund managers. </p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance has launched a new platform called Capital Connect. Capital Connect bridges institutional investors with cryptocurrency fund managers.</p>
<p>Binance explains that the platform will allow institutional investors seeking crypto exposure to do so in a safe and efficient way. Capital Connect will offer information on assets under management (AUM) of different funds, records of their performance, minimum amounts to invest and further pertinent information. After taking the necessary information into account, investors can initiate contact with fund managers via the platform.</p>
<p>Reports indicate that once contacted, investment managers can review the institutional clients&rsquo; information before accepting a connection. Capital Connect automates and facilitates the process and keeps information anonymous until such time both parties have agreed to a connection.</p>
<p>Catherine Chen, Head of Binance VP and Institutional, said in a press release:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Investors and fund managers continue to encounter network inefficiencies due to a lack in market standards.&rdquo; Adding, &ldquo;With Capital Connect, we can help create information disclosure standards for market participants with different investing and fund-raising needs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The new service platform is available to Binance&rsquo;s VIP, or high net-worth, users. The exchange has nine levels of VIP users and all are eligible to join Capital Connect.</p>
<p>In an exclusive interview with digital news outlet The Block, Chen said Binance saw a &ldquo;very rapid growth of the non-trading type of investors in the past 12 months or so&rdquo; who chose not to trade cryptocurrencies on their own, but would rather connect with active fund managers who can undertake this on their behalf. Chen explained that this is how Capital Connect came to be.</p>
<p>Chen added that Binance would not do due diligence on fund managers listed on the platform but will only allow &ldquo;high-quality&rdquo; managers to join. Fund managers must also complete the exchange&rsquo;s verification process that applies to all its users.</p>
<p>Chen further said that like Binance&rsquo;s main exchange, Capital Connect will not be available to users in the US and other restricted regions.</p>
Binance Pushes Forward Despite Numerous Setbacks
<p>Binance recently has faced serious scrutiny and criticism from regulators and the wider crypto community. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) brought charges against the exchange and its CEO Changpeng Zhao which sparked investors to withdraw over $400 million from the exchange in a matter of 24 hours.</p>
<p>Investors also caught a rather big fright on Sunday, May 7, when Binance paused Bitcoin withdrawals twice in a span of 12 hours. Binance halted withdrawals when Bitcoin transaction fees were at a high and the network heavily backlogged.</p>
<p>The exchange did however deliver good news to its users with the announcement of plans to support Bitcoin Ordinal inscriptions on its NFT marketplace later this month.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Crypto asset manager Grayscale Investments has announced the launch of Grayscale Funds Trust, a new entity managing its growing funds. Simultaneously, the firm has filed for three new crypto-focused ETFs (exchange-traded funds) with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The proposed ETFs include Ethereum Futures ETF, Global Bitcoin Composite ETF, and a Privacy ETF.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The launch of Grayscale Funds Trust signifies the company's intent to manage several of its publicly traded financial products in-house. The Global Bitcoin Composite ETF will invest in exchange-traded products related to or backed by Bitcoin, including Bitcoin mining firms. The Ethereum Futures ETF aims to offer indirect exposure to Ether's potential future value through shares tracking its price. The Grayscale Privacy ETF, meanwhile, intends to invest in companies working on blockchain-based privacy technology.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">As it stands, the three ETFs are unavailable for public purchase until the SEC approves the registration statement related to Grayscale Funds Trust. This development follows Grayscale's ongoing conflict with the SEC concerning the conversion of its $17 billion Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot Bitcoin ETF product. Grayscale sued the regulator for denying its application, arguing the SEC's treatment of crypto spot-traded exchange-traded products differed from futures products.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Despite the SEC's approval of several Bitcoin Futures ETFs, it has rejected all applications for a spot Bitcoin investment product due to concerns about exposing investors to potential fraud and market manipulation. Grayscale's expansion into the ETF business, combined with its ongoing legal conflict with the SEC, points to the complexity of terms and agreements between massive firms working on crypto-focused investments.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Concerns On Rule Changes</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein has expressed concerns that the SEC's proposed rule changes regarding the safeguarding of clients' crypto funds could prevent the company from using Coinbase as the sole holder of $5.4 billion of its crypto assets. The SEC's proposal aims to make investment advisers responsible for securing the custody of their clients' assets, which could pose challenges for centralized exchanges like Coinbase or any platform managing clients' assets through Coinbase.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Currently, Grayscale controls the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which collectively hold around $5.4 billion in Bitcoin and ether. These funds are entirely held by Coinbase through the Coinbase Custody Trust Company, using offline cold storafge and unique on-chain addresses to avoid commingling with other clients' funds. Grayscale's reliance on expert third-party custodians for safekeeping clients' assets follows the norm for traditional asset managers, and Sonnenshein asserts that none of their custodians have ever experienced a loss of client assets.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The SEC's proposed rule could significantly disrupt Grayscale's model for storing its $5.4 billion in client assets. Sonnenshein warns the SEC against taking action that might impose considerable new costs, risks, and burdens without added benefits.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Coinbase, from its end, has also expressed concerns about the proposed rule, arguing that it would not benefit registered investment advisers (RIAs) or their clients and could harm them. SEC's comment period comes to an end this month, placing into question Grayscale's relationship with Coinbase and the potential implications that this may spell out.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Despite the SEC's approval of several Bitcoin Futures ETFs, it has rejected all applications for a spot Bitcoin investment product due to concerns about exposing investors to potential fraud and market manipulation. Grayscale's expansion into the ETF business, combined with its ongoing legal conflict with the SEC, points to the complexity of terms and agreements between massive firms working on crypto-focused investments.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Concerns On Rule Changes</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein has expressed concerns that the SEC's proposed rule changes regarding the safeguarding of clients' crypto funds could prevent the company from using Coinbase as the sole holder of $5.4 billion of its crypto assets. The SEC's proposal aims to make investment advisers responsible for securing the custody of their clients' assets, which could pose challenges for centralized exchanges like Coinbase or any platform managing clients' assets through Coinbase.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Currently, Grayscale controls the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which collectively hold around $5.4 billion in Bitcoin and ether. These funds are entirely held by Coinbase through the Coinbase Custody Trust Company, using offline cold storafge and unique on-chain addresses to avoid commingling with other clients' funds. Grayscale's reliance on expert third-party custodians for safekeeping clients' assets follows the norm for traditional asset managers, and Sonnenshein asserts that none of their custodians have ever experienced a loss of client assets.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The SEC's proposed rule could significantly disrupt Grayscale's model for storing its $5.4 billion in client assets. Sonnenshein warns the SEC against taking action that might impose considerable new costs, risks, and burdens without added benefits.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Coinbase, from its end, has also expressed concerns about the proposed rule, arguing that it would not benefit registered investment advisers (RIAs) or their clients and could harm them. SEC's comment period comes to an end this month, placing into question Grayscale's relationship with Coinbase and the potential implications that this may spell out.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Fintech giant PayPal revealed it &ldquo;safeguards&rdquo; close to $1 billion in cryptocurrency assets for its clients. The bulk of the assets are in Bitcoin and Ether. </p>
<p>Electronic payment behemoth PayPal disclosed that it holds $943 million in crypto assets on behalf of its customers. In a recent filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the majority of the assets constitute $499 million in Bitcoin (BTC) and $362 million in ether (ETH). The company also holds Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC) to a value of $82 million.</p>
<p>The filing further indicates that as of March 31, the value of the assets increased by 56%, or $339 million, over the firm&rsquo;s previous quarter, where it disclosed $604 million.</p>
<p>PayPal does not actually hold its customer&rsquo;s crypto assets but rather relies on third-party custodial service providers. The company conceded that employing third-party services does present a liability for customers should third parties be unable to process transactions but said that no such event occurred. PayPal said:</p>

<p>As of March 31, 2023, the Company has not incurred any safeguarding loss events, and&nbsp;therefore, the crypto asset safeguarding liability and corresponding safeguarding asset was recorded at the same value.</p>

<p>Reports indicate that PayPal, which owns Venmo, began offering the option to buy, sell and hold crypto on its platform in October 2022. The company, after that, expanded its crypto services to include sending, receiving, and transferring crypto assets between PayPal and other exchanges and crypto wallets.</p>

<p>We allow our customers in certain markets to buy, hold, sell, receive, and send certain cryptocurrencies as well as use the proceeds from sales of cryptocurrencies to pay for purchases at checkout. These cryptocurrencies consist of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin (collectively, &lsquo;our customers&rsquo; crypto assets&rsquo;).</p>

<p>PayPal announced in December that its customers would soon be able to purchase ETH through its service, and it revealed it was working on a MetaMask Web wallet integration.</p>
<p>In its SEC filing, PayPal emphasised it meticulously keeps records of customer&rsquo;s crypto data:</p>

<p>We maintain the internal recordkeeping of our customers&rsquo; crypto assets, including the amount and type of crypto asset owned by each of our customers.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>With the Biden administration and US regulators looking to run crypto out of town, the UK has a great chance to fill the crypto regulatory void.</p>
US wants crypto out
<p>With everything said and all the actions implemented thus far, it is obvious that the US wants to drive crypto from its shores. The only real reason for this must be that the bankers are frightened of what would happen if crypto were to really gain some traction and the ordinary investor started to pull out more bank funds with which to buy bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>The fact that crypto is still not properly regulated in the US is hardly the fault of the cryptocurrency companies. All know that a visit to the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) in order to register a crypto business is a fairly certain way of jumping to the front of the queue of those waiting to be sued by the regulatory agency.</p>
<p>The companies that the SEC has gone after in recent times are some of the biggest exchanges, probably with the thinking that if these can be pulled down then investors will have far fewer options for buying and selling crypto.</p>
<p>Even so it&rsquo;s quite telling that these self same exchanges are among the most regulated in crypto, and those such as Coinbase have moved heaven and earth to accommodate the SEC, with only one aim - to become fully compliant and regulated.</p>
The UK as a global crypto hub?
<p>Therefore, the writing is on the wall, and other jurisdictions will be sounded out with a view to an eventual move should the administration and the SEC have their way.</p>
<p>One such jurisdiction is the UK, in the heart of Europe, and armed with a financial system the equal of anything in the world. Out of Brexit and out of luck as far as international trade goes, the UK needs to reinvent itself if it is going to survive.</p>
<p>The country has touted itself as becoming a global hub for cryptocurrency. Prime Minister Sunak made the announcement of this when he was still the Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>
<p>Coinbase has sounded out the UK as a possible country where they can do business, and Binance is also seeking to be fully accepted there. Even SEC commissioner Hester Peirce has suggested that some of the UK&rsquo;s regulatory framework could be adapted for US use.</p>
Beware the bankers
<p>However, it must be wondered If, just like in the US, the banks will use their vast wealth and influence to change cryptocurrency policy to suit their own ends.</p>
<p>For such a conservative country as the UK, with banking deeply embedded in its DNA, to successfully become a global cryptocurrency hub, is going to take quite some changes. Expect the bankers to be solidly against it.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Tests 28309 Target:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 11 May 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) encountered additional volatility early in the Asian session as the pair moved back above the 28000 figure and tested the 28309.29 level, an upside price objective related to recent buying pressure around the 27279.66 and 27500 areas.&nbsp; Traders initially pushed BTC/USD to the 28334.75 area after the price objective was breached, and Stops were also elected above the 27988.46 area during the ascent, an upside price objective linked to demand that strengthened around the 27500 area.&nbsp; Additional upside retracement levels in recent depreciating ranges include the 28428, 28564, 28700, 28741, 28868, 29243, and 29299 areas.&nbsp; Significant buying and selling activity recently took place around the 29298.31 area during the depreciation, an upside price objective linked to buying pressure that increased around the 28122 area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Above the market, upside price objectives relate to recent buying pressure around the 27194.51 and 28161.74 areas include the 30420.74, 31237.11, and 32556.73 levels.&nbsp; Downside price objectives related to recent depreciating ranges and levels include the 26533, 26085, 25604, and 24103 levels.&nbsp; Additional upside price objectives include the 31477.37, 32501.23, 32989.19, 34583.96, 34658.69, 35222.66, 37765.28, and 38403.97 levels.&nbsp; &nbsp;Another important price objective is the 31846.88 area, a level that represents the 50% retracement of the depreciating range from 48233.76 to 15460.&nbsp; &nbsp;Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 200-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;100-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and below the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;100-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 28491.23 and the&nbsp;100-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 28255.89.</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;26533.04/ 25604.51/ 25094.62 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;31986.16/ 32989.19/ 34658.69 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s6">Cryptocurrency is a constantly evolving space, and Q2 2023 is expected to be a breakout season for several promising projects. This article will discuss four cryptocurrencies that could become very valuable and popular this year. These coins include StableXSwap (STAX), NEAR Protocol (NEAR), Synthetix Network (SNX), and the soon-to-be-launched Uwerx. </p>
<p class="s6">StableXSwap (STAX) and NEAR Protocol (NEAR): Dynamic Duo for Stablecoin Trading and Blockchain Development</p>
<p class="s6">StableXSwap (STAX) and NEAR Protocol (NEAR) are two unique projects within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. While StableXSwap (STAX) is a stablecoin-focused AMM-style decentralized exchange built on Binance Smart Chain, NEAR Protocol (NEAR) is a cutting-edge Layer-1 blockchain project that provides a secure, scalable, and user-friendly network for developers looking to create endless decentralized applications and other projects.</p>
<p class="s6">StableXSwap (STAX) is currently ranked #1035 with a circulation supply of 13,646,645 and a market cap of $3,738,155, while NEAR Protocol (NEAR) is ranked #35 with a market cap of $1,674,799,229 and a current price of $1.93. StableXSwap (STAX)'s price is expected to reach a maximum value of $0.63 in 2024, while NEAR Protocol (NEAR) can reach a maximum of $4.36 in the same year.</p>
<p class="s6">Synthetix Network (SNX): Decentralized Exchange For The New Era Of Finance</p>
<p class="s6">Synthetix Network (SNX) is a cryptocurrency protocol designed to enable investors to create synthetic assets called &ldquo;Synths.&rdquo; This approach has proven to be a savvy move by Synthetix Network (SNX) as it significantly enhances the network's liquidity, benefiting all parties involved and providing unique tradable assets.</p>
<p class="s6">The Synthetix Network (SNX)&rsquo;s price currently stands at $2.18, with a 24-hour trading volume of $237,317,442. Synthetix Network (SNX) has experienced a 9.67% decline in the last 24 hours. The coin holds the #68 ranking on CoinMarketCap, with a market cap of $692,393,721. Industry experts predict that Synthetix Network (SNX) may potentially reach a minimum price of $4.91 by the year 2024 due to the increasing demand for synthetic assets, which Synthetix Network provides.</p>
<p class="s6">Uwerx (WERX): Redefining The Freelance Experience </p>
<p class="s6">There is a rising demand for skilled freelancers in the market. With so many talented freelancers out there, it's no surprise that the freelance industry is continuing to expand at a remarkable pace. But with that growth comes a challenge: how do we create platforms that can keep up with the ever-evolving needs of freelancers and their clients? Uwerx is the answer!</p>
<p class="s6">Uwerx will provide its users with enhanced trust and security as well as a significant reduction in fees for both businesses and freelancers. The platform will charge its users 1% as opposed to 20%, which is the current rate on most traditional freelance platforms.</p>
<p class="s6">Furthermore, Uwerx will implement a liquidity lock for 25 years to ensure platform stability as well as audit the platform with the help of InterFi Network and SolidProof. To prevent potential scams or rug pull, the Uwerx team plans to renounce ownership of the project&rsquo;s contract. </p>
<p class="s6">Technical analysis of the project forecasts that the token could reach $1.2 by the first quarter of 2024. WERX tokens are currently preselling for $0.0225 per token. Investors who take advantage of the presale may benefit from the potential growth of WERX and the freelance industry as a whole and enjoy a 20% purchase bonus as well as front seats to check out the Alpha version of the platform!</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we will explore the resurgence of the crypto market, highlighting DigiToads (TOADS)impressive fundraising feat and analyzing factors that could propel Bitcoin (BTC) to reach $100,000 by 2025. Let's dive into the details of these top crypto coins.</p>
<p class="s7">Is Digitoads The Next Big Thing?</p>
<p>It's time for the dogs and frogs to move aside &mdash; DigiToads &nbsp;has taken the crypto world by storm. The team behind the project, led by cryptocurrency industry veterans, has already raised over $2.8M in its ongoing presale and it looks like this number will rapidly increase before TOADS full launch on UniSwap and BitMart.</p>
<p>But why are investors so eager to participate in the DigiToads presale?</p>
<p>The answer lies in a clever combination of meme-based fun and sophisticated technology. DigiToads is a whole ecosystem of play-to-earn games, utility NFTs, and staking pools &mdash; there's even a metaverse.</p>
<p>This much utility and incentive are rare to find in the crypto industry, let alone in a meme-based project with such mass appeal. It's no wonder that many investors expect DigiToads to join the likes of Dogecoin (DOGE) and in the meme-crypto hall of fame.</p>
<p>The DigiToads game ecosystem is perhaps the biggest talking point of the DeFi project. Here, players enter a virtual world where they can battle, breed, and train TOADS NFTs. Players can use TOADS tokens to buy in-game items for their DigiToads, helping them grow and become more powerful.</p>
<p>TOADS NFTs holders don't even need to play the game to benefit from the utility of their cool NFTs &mdash; staking pools are available for those who don't have time or interest in playing. Staking TOADS tokens grants holders a share of staking pool rewards, so holding onto the tokens is an especially lucrative option.</p>
<p>With so much token utility and a growing community of TOADS aficionados, it is easy to see why over 198 million tokens have already been sold in the DigiToads presale. TOADS is currently priced at $0.024 per token during phase 5, with a rise to $0.027 when this phase sells out in the following days.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Buy DigiToads Now &lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s7">When Will We See Bitcoin at $100k?</p>
<p>Now that we've established the reasons behind DigiToads success, let's take a look at how Bitcoin (BTC) could reach $100K by the end of 2024.</p>
<p>First, it&rsquo;s important to note that there are many factors influencing Bitcoin's price appreciation. These include increasing institutional adoption, more favorable regulatory environments for cryptocurrency, and technological advancements that are making Bitcoin's transactions faster and cheaper.</p>
<p>But there's one major factor that will likely contribute to Bitcoin reaching $100,000 in the near future &mdash; failing banks in the U.S. First Republic, SVB, and Signature Bank have all declared bankruptcy in the last two months.</p>
<p>This could lead even more people to invest in Bitcoin (BTC) as a safe-haven asset and hedge against inflation. In fact, it seems to already be happening, with Bitcoin surging from $16,400 to over $31,000 in just three months.</p>
<p>As more countries grapple with an increasing number of bankruptcies, Bitcoin is becoming an attractive option for citizens looking to safeguard their assets from inflation or economic turmoil.</p>
<p class="s7">Summary</p>
<p>In conclusion, the recent success of DigiToads in raising over $2.8 million in presale and the optimistic projections of Bitcoin potentially reaching $100,000 by the end of 2024 serve as strong indicators that the crypto winter is indeed over. However, it's important to pick and choose which projects to invest in. DigiToads has the right potential to be better than great. &nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s7">Yachtify (YCHT) sets a course for financial success by offering a unique investment opportunity in the maritime industry, outshining established projects like Axie Infinity (AXS) and Polygon (MATIC). By democratizing yacht ownership and enabling users to capitalize on the lucrative yacht rental market, Yachtify provides investors with a distinctive and promising avenue for portfolio growth.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY YACHTIFY TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s11">Yachtify (YCHT): A Promising Alternative Investment</p>
<p class="s7">Yachtify (YCHT) presents a unique opportunity for investors to participate in the world's first fractional yacht investment platform, offering an innovative solution for earning passive income through boat ownership. By allowing investors to buy, sell, and rent real-world yachts in fractions, Yachtify (YCHT) democratizes access to an exclusive market that was previously reserved for the wealthy.</p>
<p class="s7">Yachtify's upcoming presale offers investors an enticing opportunity to join the project at an early stage. With the native token, $YCHT, priced at just $0.10 per token during the presale, participants can secure their stake in this groundbreaking venture at an attractive entry point. Moreover, investors who join the presale may also benefit from exclusive bonuses, further enhancing the potential returns on their investment.</p>
<p class="s7">As the crypto space continues to evolve, Yachtify (YCHT) stands out as a promising alternative to traditional investments. With its unique fractional ownership model, a recession-proof maritime industry, and an accessible entry point through the presale, Yachtify (YCHT) is poised to revolutionize the yacht market and offer investors a chance to navigate toward financial success.</p>
<p class="s11">Axie Infinity (AXS) Encounters Hurdles in the Competitive Crypto-Gaming Sector</p>
<p class="s7">Axie Infinity (AXS), a pioneering blockchain gaming platform, has made headlines for its innovative use of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to represent in-game assets such as characters, items, and land. Axie Infinity (AXS) play-to-earn model has attracted a massive user base, driving the creation of a thriving market for NFTs and gaming tokens. </p>
<p class="s7">Axie Infinity (AXS) high-profile partnerships with industry giants like Samsung, Ubisoft, and Binance further demonstrate the potential for blockchain-based gaming. However, despite these accomplishments, Axie Infinity (AXS) confronts challenges in the rapidly evolving crypto-gaming landscape. As new projects and competitors emerge, Axie Infinity (AXS) must adapt and consistently innovate to stay ahead of the curve and maintain its competitive edge in the industry.</p>
<p class="s11">Polygon (MATIC) Struggles to Prosper</p>
<p class="s7">Polygon (MATIC) has recently faced difficulties, raising questions about the reasons for its underperformance. Factors such as market capitalization, the team's emphasis on network development, and previous growth cycles have all contributed to the token's downturn. </p>
<p class="s7">For example, with a market cap of around $10 billion, Polygon (MATIC) has already gone through its price discovery phase, which could limit its growth potential compared to smaller, emerging projects. </p>
<p class="s7">Furthermore, the Polygon (MATIC) initial growth cycle saw its value skyrocket from $0.04 to a high of $2.59. After peaking close to $3 at the beginning of 2022, Polygon (MATIC) growth may have plateaued, a common phenomenon for many cryptocurrencies following rapid expansion periods.</p>
<p class="s7">In light of these challenges, investors might consider exploring alternative opportunities such as Yachtify (YCHT), which offers a unique investment proposition through its fractional yacht ownership model and access to the recession-proof maritime industry. As Polygon (MATIC) wrestles with these obstacles, Yachtify (YCHT) emerges as an appealing option for investors seeking portfolio diversification and potential growth.</p>

<p class="s7">As the crypto space continues to evolve, Yachtify (YCHT) stands out as a promising alternative to traditional investments. With its unique fractional ownership model, a recession-proof maritime industry, and an accessible entry point through the presale, Yachtify (YCHT) is poised to revolutionize the yacht market and offer investors a chance to navigate toward financial success.</p>
<p class="s11">Axie Infinity (AXS) Encounters Hurdles in the Competitive Crypto-Gaming Sector</p>
<p class="s7">Axie Infinity (AXS), a pioneering blockchain gaming platform, has made headlines for its innovative use of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to represent in-game assets such as characters, items, and land. Axie Infinity (AXS) play-to-earn model has attracted a massive user base, driving the creation of a thriving market for NFTs and gaming tokens. </p>
<p class="s7">Axie Infinity (AXS) high-profile partnerships with industry giants like Samsung, Ubisoft, and Binance further demonstrate the potential for blockchain-based gaming. However, despite these accomplishments, Axie Infinity (AXS) confronts challenges in the rapidly evolving crypto-gaming landscape. As new projects and competitors emerge, Axie Infinity (AXS) must adapt and consistently innovate to stay ahead of the curve and maintain its competitive edge in the industry.</p>
<p class="s11">Polygon (MATIC) Struggles to Prosper</p>
<p class="s7">Polygon (MATIC) has recently faced difficulties, raising questions about the reasons for its underperformance. Factors such as market capitalization, the team's emphasis on network development, and previous growth cycles have all contributed to the token's downturn. </p>
<p class="s7">For example, with a market cap of around $10 billion, Polygon (MATIC) has already gone through its price discovery phase, which could limit its growth potential compared to smaller, emerging projects. </p>
<p class="s7">Furthermore, the Polygon (MATIC) initial growth cycle saw its value skyrocket from $0.04 to a high of $2.59. After peaking close to $3 at the beginning of 2022, Polygon (MATIC) growth may have plateaued, a common phenomenon for many cryptocurrencies following rapid expansion periods.</p>
<p class="s7">In light of these challenges, investors might consider exploring alternative opportunities such as Yachtify (YCHT), which offers a unique investment proposition through its fractional yacht ownership model and access to the recession-proof maritime industry. As Polygon (MATIC) wrestles with these obstacles, Yachtify (YCHT) emerges as an appealing option for investors seeking portfolio diversification and potential growth.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Investors and traders are consistently on the lookout for new and exciting blockchain-based projects through which they can diversify their holdings. With the collapse of centralized banks and the overall negative outlook on FIAT currencies, the Web3 space has managed to grow in appeal.</p>
<p>However, some of the most well-known cryptocurrencies, such as Litecoin (LTC) and Avalanche (AVAX), have dipped in value. As such, investors and traders have begun eyeing the Sparklo bitcoin and its presale as a high-growth alternative.</p>
<p>Sparklo (SPRK) Sees Significant Momentum At Its Presale Stage</p>
<p>Sparklo is being developed as a platform for making investments in which anyone can have the opportunity to make fractionalized investments within non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that represent silver, gold, and platinum.</p>
<p>Every time someone aims to buy a gold bar, for example, or a fraction of it, an NFT gets minted, and then it gets fractionalized. This opens up the opportunity for anyone to either be able to buy an entire NFT and get the underlying gold bar delivered to them or for them to just buy a fraction of it in order to get exposure to the precious metals asset class.</p>
<p>As for the security of the platform, it has already been audited by the InterFi network, and its liquidity will be locked for 100 years.</p>
<p>The native cryptocurrency, SPRK, is trading at a value of $0.017 at its level one presale. Analysts predict that its value can reach 40x in the upcoming months.</p>
<p>As such, as most experienced investors know, getting into solid projects at the early stage is where the most significant gains can often be made, and we highly recommend checking out Sparklo at its presale stage.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Blockchain technology penetrates markets at an astounding rate; even the European Banking Federation has recently pushed for a digital euro. But beyond this, crypto projects and their blockchain fundamentals are transforming traditional industries. A classic example would be Uwerx, totally disrupting the gig economy, which many analysts believe could reach the heights of Fantom (FTM) and Aptos (APT) in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uwerx (WERX) Tackling Freelancing&nbsp;</p>
<p>Freelancing has been the pervading trend in the jobs sector for the past several years, and given how popular it is amongst millennials, experts expect it to be the defining work trend of the decade. Forbes quoted Kasriel, Co-chair of the World Economic Forum&rsquo;s council on the Future of Gender, Education, and Work: &lsquo;&lsquo;Increased earnings contributed to total freelance earnings of $1.4 trillion, up from $1.1 trillion last year. To me, that is a shockingly high number.&rsquo;&rsquo; Uwerx currently raises funds to build and deploy a new decentralized freelance marketplace on the Polygon (MATIC) network. Uwerx has outlined a plan to develop this service with freelancers at the forefront and will include in-built collaboration tools, transparent pricing, and personalized matching. Additionally, Uwerx will incentivize freelancers with the WERX token, which powers the entire platform; this is on top of being more cost-efficient and trusted than the current market incumbents. Analysts have pointed to Uwerx&rsquo;s market fit and stated that the token may trade as high as $4 by 2024- a massive movement from its presale price of $0.225. Fantom (FTM) Price PredictionFantom (FTM) enjoyed meteoric success in 2021 with the rise of the alternative layer one narrative. Analysts believe that Uwerx could display similar growth metrics as Fantom (FTM) did in its early days. Fantom&rsquo;s (FTM) growth has not stopped, largely thanks to the Fantom (FTM) Foundation, which has continued to drive adoption and development through unique incentive schemes such as the gas monetization program. Fantom (FTM) trades at $0.37, with analysts giving price predictions ranging between $0.79 and $0.88 in 2024. Fantom (FTM) still has room to grow, but the time to buy Fantom (FTM) for outrageous returns was in 2020.Aptos (APT) Price Prediction Aptos (APT) is a layer one blockchain that received criticism due to the amount of Aptos (APT) tokens held by insiders and venture capital investors. But this did not stop Aptos (APT) from rallying impressively throughout the start of this year. Aptos&rsquo;s (APT) pivot towards GameFi has excited investors and analysts, and GameFi seems to be a perfect application for the Aptos (APT) chain, given its excellent throughput. Aptos (APT) trades at $8.35, with price predictions from analysts putting its price between $21 and $24 in 2024. Join the Presale Today&nbsp;</p>
<p>Audits, locked liquidity, and renounced smart contracts. Three things every presale investor should search for. Uwerx ticks all boxes: audits from SolidProof and InterFi Network, a twenty five year liquidity lock when the presale closes, and the team formally renounced smart contract ownership. These are all excellent signs for this budding freelance disruptor and great indicators for early investors. Investors who missed Fantom (FTM) and Aptos (APT) have another chance with Uwerx, and those who want to join this exciting journey can participate in the presale by following the links below and enjoy a 20% purchase bonus.Find Out More Here:&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Venom Foundation has recently unveiled an exciting new collaboration with the Kenyan Government to create a revolutionary "blockchain hub" in Africa. This ambitious initiative will focus on the growth and application of Web3 and blockchain technology in key industries, including finance, supply chain, agriculture, SMEs, and cross-border trade. This partnership has the potential to bring substantial benefits to not only Kenya but the entire African continent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Boosting Financial Infrastructure and Empowering African Communities
<p>Despite more than 84% of Kenya's population having access to financial services through banks and fintech, integrating blockchain infrastructure into long-term strategies is expected to provide even more value. The domestic economy will benefit from additional opportunities, new international trade routes, and increased efficiency in intra-African trade lines.</p>
<p>The Venom Foundation's expansion into Africa showcases the continent's progressive approach to adopting Web3 and blockchain technologies. This commitment to embracing innovation and leading through implementation will empower African communities, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the Web3 world, and stimulating regional economic growth through seamless cross-border transactions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Unlocking Blockchain's Potential for Economic Development
<p>Blockchain technology can bring tangible benefits such as reduced transaction costs, improved security and transparency, complete access to financial services, faster settlement times for cross-border transactions, and new investment opportunities through asset tokenization. These advancements could significantly contribute to economic development and financial inclusion across Africa.</p>
<p>The proposed blockchain hub will serve as a central platform for forming partnerships with innovative companies, fostering knowledge sharing, networking, and collaboration among key stakeholders in the blockchain space. That includes projects, entrepreneurs, and government officials based in Africa. Venom will also provide essential tools and resources to support African countries in laying a solid foundation for digital transformation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Venom&rsquo;s Blockchain Solutions for a Digital Future
<p>The partnership aims to implement blockchain-based solutions for supply chain management, land registry, voting systems, tokenization of assets, and other areas where blockchain technology can significantly impact. The collaboration will promote transparency, efficiency, and trust across various sectors throughout the continent.</p>
<p>Christopher Louis Tsu, CTO for the Venom Foundation, expressed his optimism about the project, saying, "Africa is already rich in natural resources and human capital. By bringing next-generation blockchain technology to the continent, it will empower the people and help not only Kenya but many other African nations to capitalize on their assets and participate in new global markets, competitively."</p>
<p>The Kenyan government also expressed enthusiasm for the partnership. Moses Kuria, the Cabinet Secretary for Investments, Trade, and Industry, stated, "We are thrilled to join forces with the Venom Foundation. This collaboration symbolizes our commitment to embracing next-generation technology and keeping pace with financial and technological developments worldwide. We believe that the establishment of this blockchain hub will catalyze further innovations in various industries, benefitting our people both nationally and globally."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
A Bright Future for Blockchain in Africa
<p>The strategic partnership between the Venom Foundation and the Kenyan government marks a new chapter in Africa's pursuit of technological advancement. The development of this blockchain hub will not only enhance existing industries but also pave the way for new innovations to emerge, promoting a more prosperous and inclusive future for the continent.</p>
<p>As Africa's interest in Web3 and blockchain technologies continues to grow, the continent is positioning itself at the forefront of the global digital transformation. Africa is taking a giant leap toward a brighter, more connected future by investing in cutting-edge solutions and fostering collaborative environments like the blockchain hub.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Hester Peirce, SEC commissioner, recently said that Europe's new regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies 'MiCA', could be a model that the US could follow.</p>
MiCA and UK regulatory models
<p>MiCA is designed to provide clarity and transparency in the cryptocurrency industry, while also protecting consumers from fraudulent activities. Under this proposed framework, cryptocurrency companies would be required to comply with regulations that are designed to properly define the various areas of the crypto sector and provide much needed clarity.</p>
<p>Peirce believes that the MiCA model strikes the right balance between protecting consumers while still leaving room for innovation in the cryptocurrency industry. She has also stated her optimism for the regulatory framework that the UK is currently working on.</p>
<p>In a recent financial panel discussion held in London, Peirce stated that the US could find some good insights in MiCA and the UK&rsquo;s regulatory models. She said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I share with you the approach of telling people &lsquo;look, there are risks here, you can choose to opt into those risks or opt out.&rsquo; And then trying to figure out a regulatory model that allows for innovation,&rdquo;</p>

Both investor protections and innovation
<p>Peirce's comments have received mixed reactions from the cryptocurrency community. While some have praised her efforts to promote and foster a fair regulatory framework for crypto, others argue that MiCA is way too restrictive and will stifle innovation.</p>
<p>Overall, Europe&rsquo;s MiCA is an important step towards regulating the cryptocurrency industry. For the industry to continue to grow, it is essential that regulators walk the narrow path between protecting consumers while also allowing for the undoubted innovation and growth to continue to flourish in the crypto sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only time will tell whether the MiCA model will become the standard for cryptocurrency regulation, but it is hopefully a step in the right direction.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>It's no secret that meme coins have taken the world by storm, with Dogecoin (DOGE) and Floki Inu (FLOKI) leading the pack. However, with the upcoming launch of Big Eyes Coin (BIG), the meme coin season is about to get a lot more exciting and interesting. The first-ever cat-themed meme coin has already created a massive frenzy with its highly successful presale, which has gone beyond $35.50 million with only a month remaining until the culmination of the presale.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this article, we'll take a closer look at Big Eyes Coin and how it competes with established coins like Dogecoin and Floki Inu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Choice is Yours: Join or Miss Out!</p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin is set to end its presale on June 3, 2023, with the token launching on Uniswap on June 15, 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What's more, the presale ending promotional code END300 gives people the chance to earn a bonus of 300% on top of their purchase. This means that not only will BIG be launching soon, but early adopters will also have a chance to get more bang for their buck.</p>
<p>Dogecoin and Floki Inu, on the other hand, have already launched and are trading on multiple exchanges. While they don't have a promotional code like Big Eyes Coin, their current prices still present a buying opportunity for those looking to invest in meme coins.</p>
<p>Security and Privacy</p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin is based on the Ethereum (ERC-20) blockchain, which offers advanced security features that are superior to industry leaders. Furthermore, Big Eyes Coin&rsquo;s decentralized nature means that it offers absolute privacy to its users.</p>
<p>In comparison, Dogecoin is based on the Bitcoin protocol and has its own unique features. Its security and privacy are similar to that of Bitcoin and Litecoin. Floki Inu, on the other hand, is based on the both Ethereum blockchain and Binance Smart Chain, known for its fast transaction speeds but is still relatively new in the industry.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Innovation and Unique Features</p>
<p>One of the most exciting things about Big Eyes Coin is its innovative features. For example, the introduction of Loot Boxes, which are popular in the gaming world, helps users get the most out of their investments and purchases. Additionally, Big Eyes Coin&rsquo;s speedier and less costly transactions make it an attractive option for those looking for a more efficient cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Dogecoin, on the other hand, is known for its simplicity and user-friendliness. Its most significant innovation lies in its community-driven nature, which has helped it gain a massive following.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Floki Inu, similarly, has tried to differentiate itself by introducing unique features like the Floki Inu Wallet, which allows users to earn rewards simply by holding FLOKI.</p>
<p>Community and Social Responsibility</p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin is a community-centric digital currency that gains its strength from its strong community and dedicated team of developers. Furthermore, it is dedicated to social causes and will hold 5% of its total token supply in a charity wallet and donate to ocean-saving charities because &ldquo;healthy oceans produce delicious cat food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dogecoin has one of the most dedicated communities in the cryptocurrency space. Its community has been instrumental in driving its adoption and success. Floki Inu&rsquo;s community is also growing, but it remains to be seen whether it can match DOGE's dedicated following.</p>
<p>Token Supply and Price Differential</p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin will have a limited supply of 200 billion tokens, of which 80%, including 5% charity wallet, will be available at the launch on June 15, 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In stage 13, 1,891.89 BIG tokens are available for 1 USDT. This means that investors can buy 100K BIG tokens for only $52.85. The presale, which started at $0.0001 in Stage 1, has seen a significant increase in value, reaching $0.00053 in Stage 13. However, the excitement doesn't stop there. Big Eyes Coin has also announced a promotional code, END300, for its presale ending. This code gives people the chance to earn a bonus of 300% on top of their purchase.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Comparing Big Eyes Coin with Dogecoin and Floki Inu</p>
<p>Now, let's compare Big Eyes Coin with the two most popular meme coins in the market - Dogecoin and Floki Inu.</p>
<p>Dogecoin was created in 2013 as a joke by two software engineers. However, in recent years, it has gained significant popularity, with Elon Musk being a vocal supporter of the coin. Despite its popularity, Dogecoin has some limitations that Big Eyes Coin does not. For example, Dogecoin does not have advanced security features like Big Eyes Coin, making it more vulnerable to hacking and other cybersecurity threats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Floki Inu, on the other hand, is a relatively new meme coin that has been gaining a lot of attention lately. However, its success is still uncertain, and it remains to be seen how it will perform in the long run.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What sets Big Eyes Coin apart from Floki Inu is its innovative features like speedier and less costly transactions, as well as the unique Loot Boxes that allow users to get the most out of their investments and purchases.</p>
<p>Key Takeaways</p>
<p>The meme coin season is here, and investors are on the lookout for the next big thing in the crypto world. While Dogecoin and Floki Inu have gained significant popularity, Big Eyes Coin offers a unique and innovative approach to cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With advanced security features, absolute privacy, and a community-centric approach, Big Eyes Coin is well-positioned to become a leader in the meme coin market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project's innovative Loot Boxes and charitable contributions also set it apart from other meme coins. With the presale ending promotional code END300 and a significant increase in value from Stage 1 to Stage 13, Big Eyes Coin is an attractive investment opportunity for anyone looking to enter the cryptocurrency market.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>With the recent bull run in the crypto market, meme coins have once again become the talk of the town, thanks to their impressive gains and the attention they are receiving from investors. As the popularity of these meme coins surges during the bull run, presales have become a vital aspect of fundraising for crypto projects. This has enabled projects like Floki Inu (FLOKI), which follows a community-driven approach and has unique tokenomics, to raise funds and draw attention from investors. Other meme coins, such as DeeLance (DLANCE) and DogeMiyagi (MIYAGI), have also captured the interest of crypto enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Floki Inu&rsquo;s Community Led Growth</p>
<p>Floki Inu (FLOKI) is a relatively new meme coin that has gained popularity due to its unique approach to community-led growth. Named after Elon Musk's dog, the coin has built a passionate following by leveraging this association. One of the primary ways Floki Inu has engaged with its community is through the Valhalla Metaverse project, which is a web3 platform enabling users to create and trade NFTs within a virtual world. The project has been a significant focus for Floki Inu and has attracted new users to the coin. Additionally, the coin has emphasized its commitment to transparency and community involvement, with regular updates and community-driven initiatives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>DeeLance Shaking Up Web3</p>
<p>&nbsp;DeeLance (DLANCE) recently launched its $DLANCE token presale, which has become one of the most successful altcoins in the Web3 freelancing and recruitment sphere, currently trading at a mere $0.025 USDT per token. DeeLance's principal goal is to change the way freelancers and businesses operate in a decentralized setting by giving users complete control over their projects and the option to receive cryptocurrency payments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DeeLance is poised to shake up the freelancing apps industry by delivering better conditions to users at a lower price than Upwork, Freelancers, and Fiverr, among other established solutions. The Web3 application promises to provide superior services to freelancers and clients, potentially attracting millions of freelancers worldwide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DeeLance offers a suite of tools and services that go beyond just improving the productivity of freelancers. The platform also features an NFT marketplace, metaverse, and recruitment platform to cater to the diverse needs of its users. Moreover, DeeLance's fee structure is highly competitive, with a meager transaction fee of 2% for clients and 10% for freelancers, allowing users to retain more of their earnings.&nbsp;</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the recent bull run in the crypto market, meme coins have once again become the talk of the town, thanks to their impressive gains and the attention they are receiving from investors. As the popularity of these meme coins surges during the bull run, presales have become a vital aspect of fundraising for crypto projects. This has enabled projects like Floki Inu (FLOKI), which follows a community-driven approach and has unique tokenomics, to raise funds and draw attention from investors. Other meme coins, such as DeeLance (DLANCE) and DogeMiyagi (MIYAGI), have also captured the interest of crypto enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Floki Inu&rsquo;s Community Led Growth</p>
<p>Floki Inu (FLOKI) is a relatively new meme coin that has gained popularity due to its unique approach to community-led growth. Named after Elon Musk's dog, the coin has built a passionate following by leveraging this association. One of the primary ways Floki Inu has engaged with its community is through the Valhalla Metaverse project, which is a web3 platform enabling users to create and trade NFTs within a virtual world. The project has been a significant focus for Floki Inu and has attracted new users to the coin. Additionally, the coin has emphasized its commitment to transparency and community involvement, with regular updates and community-driven initiatives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>DeeLance Shaking Up Web3</p>
<p>&nbsp;DeeLance (DLANCE) recently launched its $DLANCE token presale, which has become one of the most successful altcoins in the Web3 freelancing and recruitment sphere, currently trading at a mere $0.025 USDT per token. DeeLance's principal goal is to change the way freelancers and businesses operate in a decentralized setting by giving users complete control over their projects and the option to receive cryptocurrency payments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DeeLance is poised to shake up the freelancing apps industry by delivering better conditions to users at a lower price than Upwork, Freelancers, and Fiverr, among other established solutions. The Web3 application promises to provide superior services to freelancers and clients, potentially attracting millions of freelancers worldwide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DeeLance offers a suite of tools and services that go beyond just improving the productivity of freelancers. The platform also features an NFT marketplace, metaverse, and recruitment platform to cater to the diverse needs of its users. Moreover, DeeLance's fee structure is highly competitive, with a meager transaction fee of 2% for clients and 10% for freelancers, allowing users to retain more of their earnings.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange QuadrigaCX will begin interim distributions to some of its affected users, with Ernst &amp; Young (EY) acting as trustee for some of the users.&nbsp;</p>
Good News For QuadrigaCX Victims
<p>The Canadian crypto exchange has announced its decision to start distributing funds to certain users who were affected by the firm&rsquo;s bankruptcy two years ago. The exchange first declared bankruptcy in 2019 following the sudden death of its CEO, Gerald Cotten, and the subsequent revelation that he had been the only one with access to the exchange's cold storage wallets. The firm, which was once Canada&rsquo;s largest crypto exchange, ended up owing customers around $200 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The exact amount of funds available for distribution is not yet clear. The court-appointed monitor for QuadrigaCX&rsquo;s bankruptcy proceedings, Ernst &amp; Young (EY), has stated that it is working to recover as much of the missing funds as possible but has acknowledged that it may not be possible to recover all of them. The distribution will be made from the funds that have already been recovered, which are primarily in the form of fiat currency held in QuadrigaCX's bank accounts.</p>
EY Announces Fund Repayment
<p>The law firm representing QuadrigaCX&rsquo;s creditors, Miller Thompson, shared the statement from EY clarifying that the interim distributions will be made to those users who have already had their claims approved. The funds will be distributed on a pro-rata basis, meaning that each user will receive a percentage of their claim based on the amount of funds available for distribution.</p>
<p>The statement read,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you received a Notice of Disallowance, you have the right to appeal the decision. The first step is to review the reasons for the revision or disallowance and gather any necessary evidence to support their claim. In this case, the Trustee is most likely to have issued a Notice of Disallowance if there was a discrepancy in your proof of claim."</p>

Fraud Or Misfortune?&nbsp;
<p>The announcement of the interim distribution is a significant step forward for QuadrigaCX's affected users, many of whom have been waiting for over two years to receive their funds. Given the complex and unusual circumstances of the exchange's collapse, some users feared that they would never receive any of their funds back.</p>
<p>QuadrigaCX's collapse and subsequent bankruptcy have been the subject of much scrutiny and speculation in the cryptocurrency industry. Many have criticized the exchange's lack of transparency and accountability, and some have suggested that the founder's death was an additional factor to the pre-existing mismanagement or fraud in the management.&nbsp;</p>
