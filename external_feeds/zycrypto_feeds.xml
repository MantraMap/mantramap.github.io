<p>On Monday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged New York crypto asset manager Titan Global Capital Management with misleading investors over its cryptocurrency product.</p>



<p>Titan has agreed to a cease-and-desist order by the regulatory agency, alongside censure and penalties of over $1 million.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-titan-to-pay-over-1-million-to-settle-sec-charges"><strong>Titan To Pay Over $1 Million To Settle SEC Charges</strong></h2>



<p>The latest in a series of recent enforcement actions initiated by the SEC under chairman Gary Gensler involves fintech investment adviser Titan.</p>



<p>In a Monday <a href="https://twitter.com/SECGov/status/1693637752460394562">announcement</a>, the securities watchdog indicated that the fintech firm made “conflicting disclosures to clients” about how it custodied cryptocurrency assets. According to the SEC, Titan made misleading claims on its website that were based on “hypothetical performance”. SEC senior enforcement officer Osman Nawaz opined in a statement:</p>



<p><em>“The Commission amended the marketing rule to allow for the use of hypothetical performance metrics but only if advisers comply with requirements reasonably designed to prevent fraud. […] This action serves as a warning for all advisers to ensure compliance.”</em></p>



<p>The SEC further argued that Titan promised investors “annualized” performance results as high as 2,700% for its Titan Crypto product but didn’t inform clients the returns were inferred from a hypothetical three-week period during which no trading transpired. Simply put: They were fabricated.</p>



<p>The regulator also claimed that Titan failed to adopt appropriate policies concerning employee personal trading in cryptocurrencies until October 2022.</p>



<p>The SEC has been more active in crypto law enforcement this year. In June, it sued both <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-suffers-double-whammy-as-sec-and-state-regulators-act-against-exchange-for-unregistered-securities/">Coinbase </a>and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">Binance </a>for allegedly allowing its customers to trade tokens it deemed unregistered securities.</p>



<p>But today’s charges marked the first time a firm had supposedly broken the SEC’s amended marketing rule of December 2020, which urges investment advisers to ensure the accuracy of disclosures made to existing and prospective clients.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cease-and-desist-order"><strong>Cease-And-Desist Order</strong></h2>



<p>Titan, which is SEC-registered and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, postulated in a statement:</p>



<p><em>“We fully cooperated with the SEC’s inquiry and are pleased to have reached a resolution of these issues. The SEC Order acknowledges Titan’s cooperation and remedial efforts since July 2022, including hiring a new Chief Legal and Chief Compliance Officer and additional legal and compliance staff. Titan continues to make significant investments to build and enhance its compliance program.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>The fintech firm cooperated with the SEC&#8217;s investigation and agreed to a cease-and-desist order. Titan has also agreed to pay a $850,000 civil penalty that will be distributed to affected customers and give back ill-gotten gains and interest of $192,454 — without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings.</p>

<p>Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin moved 600 ether, worth roughly $1 million, to crypto exchange Coinbase on Monday, according to data from Ethereum network explorer, Etherscan.</p>



<p>It’s unclear why Buterin deposited the ether, but transfers to centralized exchanges are typically interpreted as a desire to sell. And his movement might increase selling pressure on ether, whose price has recently plummeted amid a crypto market-wide downturn that saw traders<a href="https://zycrypto.com/did-spacex-news-trigger-bitcoins-soul-crashing-flash-crash-to-sub-26000/"> suffer over $1 billion in liquidations</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-vitalik-transfers-600-ether-to-coinbase"><strong>Vitalik Transfers 600 Ether To Coinbase</strong></h2>



<p>Blockchain sleuths have <a href="https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1693541323532620159">identified</a> the transfer of $1 million of ETH belonging to a wallet address linked to Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin.</p>



<p>The Ethereum founder moved 600 ETH to Coinbase on August 21. Cryptically named “vitalik.eth”, the address still holds over 3,900 ETH valued at around $6.5 million as of press time, was created seven years ago. </p>



<p>The wallet also contains $84,000 in USD Coin (USDC) and $58,000 of Wrapped Ethereum (WETH).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Blockchain data from on-chain tracker Lookonchain <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1693550177863549268">shows </a>that Buterin repaid 251,000 RAI Reflex Index (RAI) tokens on Maker and proceeded to withdraw 1,000 ETH (worth around $1,67 million) shortly before the transfer of ETH to Coinbase.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-eth-about-to-fall-to-1-000"><strong>Is ETH About To Fall To $1,000?</strong></h2>



<p>Vitalik’s transaction comes as ether, the industry’s second most valuable crypto endured a 9.9% slide over the past seven days as the broader market remains fragile.</p>



<p>Well-known crypto strategist Ali Martinez foresees a significant pullback in the Ethereum price if it drops below the $1,600- $1,550 zone. Ether is changing hands at $$1,664.79 at the time of writing. This means the crypto could soon see a 37%-45% drop from here, crashing to as low as $1000 — according to Martinez.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ethereum?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Ethereum</a> | Slipping beneath the $1,600 &#8211; $1,550 bracket for <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ETH&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$ETH</a> might set the stage for a significant 37% &#8211; 45% correction, targeting $1,000. <a href="https://t.co/Xmo7Mgfux5">pic.twitter.com/Xmo7Mgfux5</a></p>&mdash; Ali (@ali_charts) <a href="https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1693507725169193156?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Buterin’s latest transfer caused a stir on social media, with some crypto enthusiasts suggesting that the move could put additional strain on ETH. Their views are not entirely unwarranted, as the last time he sent ether to crypto exchanges between June 5 and 7, a 14% drop ensued, as per CoinGecko data.</p>



<p>However, in March, the Ethereum creator’s deposit to exchanges coincided with the local bottom of around $1,400, implying that the impact on price after these transfers is just a mere coincidence.</p>

<p>Crypto Educator and Analyst VirtualBacon has long been known for his contempt of XRP, claiming underperformance and centralization. But that narrative may have finally shifted because, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/VirtualBacon0x/status/1691275102254452737?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">the analyst</a>, he now believes XRP can outperform most large networks in the coming bull run.</p>



<p>He said: <em>“I hated $XRP for years for its centralization and bad price performance. But now I truly believe $XRP will be one of the best performers in the next bull run. Most other large caps are either becoming irrelevant or have already pumped.”</em></p>



<p>As to the reasons why he believes this to be the case, the analyst lists three main reasons. He explains that XRP did not return to its all-time high for five years and had two cycles of price suppression. Additionally, he said, <em>“Tokenomics proved to be ok since 70-80% relocked in escrow in last 3 years, Ripple didn&#8217;t dump like I feared”.</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-xrp-returned-to-escrow-reflecting-the-prudent-approach"><strong>XRP Returned to Escrow, Reflecting the Prudent Approach</strong></h2>



<p>This comes after Ripple returned 80% of its 1 billion XRP into escrow, which it released earlier in August. In 2017, Ripple introduced an escrow system to lock 55 billion XRP tokens, about 55% of its supply. These were split into 1 billion XRP each escrow, unlocked monthly to ensure supply control, predictability, and ecosystem stability while meeting holder demands and supporting XRP&#8217;s growth.</p>



<p>The final reason why VirtualBacon is bullish on XRP is that he believes the demand for XRP and others are continuously increasing with the advancement of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), FedNow.</p>



<p>It should be noted that the FedNow Service is a payment system the Federal Reserve offers to enable banks and credit unions to transfer funds for customers, similar to Fedwire and FedACH. Unlike a currency, it doesn&#8217;t replace any payment methods like cash. According to its website, the Federal Reserve hasn&#8217;t officially announced any decisions on issuing a CBDC and would require legal authorization for such a step.</p>



<p>In addition, investment focus for XRP-related assets under management (AuM) has surged by 127% this year, accounting for 12% AuM. The recent <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">favourable ruling</a> in the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) case against Ripple Labs, differentiating XRP from securities, increased investor interest. While this has prompted major exchanges to relist the token and boost liquidity, the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/judge-in-ripple-court-fight-grants-secs-appeal-bid-bad-omen-for-xrp/">SEC&#8217;s plan to appeal</a> the decision on Ripple&#8217;s XRP sales raises new uncertainties.</p>



<p>XRP price trends downwards with the overall market at the time of writing, landing XRP below 60 cents again after it had experienced a rally to 84 cents post the court&#8217;s rejection of most of the SEC’s challenges.</p>

<ul>
<li>The BIP 324 upgrade will encrypt communications between several nodes, making it difficult for third parties to track.</li>



<li>Lead developer Dhruv Mehta explained that the philosophy of the update is centred on preserving the independence and permissionless nature of BTC.</li>



<li>In the market, BTC fell by 0.04% over the last 24 hours as the asset traded slightly above $26,100.</li>
</ul>



<p>The mainstream adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) continues to grow amid pressure on some governments and centralized financial institutions to curtail its buzz with tight regulatory frameworks and taxes.</p>



<p>A new update, the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 324, seeks to improve the privacy of Bitcoin transactions making it a step harder for third parties to spy on the activities of users. Made <a href="https://twitter.com/spiralbtc/status/1397219302030331907?s=21&amp;t=YXlAj_aoNZNsDZY5872EMQ">mainstream</a> by Bitcoin Core developer Dhruv Mheta in 2021, the proposal will encrypt communications between nodes making data like transaction location difficult to track.</p>



<p>Presently, the update is nearing its completion as a greater part of the code has been written with tests ongoing. Censorship remains at the centre of this new update following growing threats by some governments and other third parties. </p>



<p>According to Mheta, the architecture of Bitcoin requires unencrypted traffic between nodes creating a vacuum that can be hijacked by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) causing huge problems.</p>



<p>“<em>If they can attack nodes, they can make it very hard for you to use Bitcoin. They can eclipse your node. They can identify that you are running a Bitcoin Core node. They can identify the source of the transactions. They can make it very very hard to run the node…” </em>he added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With access to the communication traffic, the government will have access to information it needs to censor BTC transactions from certain locations defeating the primary purpose of the asset.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-step-toward-freedom"><strong>A step toward freedom</strong></h2>



<p>To Mheta, BIS 324 will not completely eliminate the risk of having a third-party attack but will make it a step more difficult. It makes gathering information harder, requiring the “<em>attacker</em> <em>to connect to every node it wants to spy on.”</em></p>



<p>Without the update, third parties can take this information without being noticed, leaving users at risk. BIS 324 is an added step because those third parties making an attempt at connecting to every node will be spotted.</p>



<p>The cost implications to connect with every node also reduce the risk of its occurrence.</p>



<p>“<em>If you raise the bar from passive to active, then it takes a lot more resources to do these things, so what then happens is, there has to be a bigger reason to do it. Today attackers could go after very small amounts of Bitcoin because they can potentially be targeted with it.&#8221;  </em>Mheta added.</p>

<p>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has issued a fresh warning to financial institutions about the increased and complex risks associated with crypto-related activities.</p>



<p>In its 2023 risk review report released Monday, the agency said that crypto-assets &#8220;pose novel and complex risks to the U.S. banking system that are difficult to fully assess.&#8221; Created in 1933, the FDIC is tasked with assessing risks facing financial institutions and saving struggling banks.</p>



<p>The report also highlighted <a href="https://zycrypto.com/banks-should-approach-crypto-investments-with-extra-caution-says-fdic-chairman/">various risks</a> associated with crypto-assets and crypto-asset sector participants, including fraud, legal uncertainties, misleading disclosures and poor risk management practices among others, noting that banks ran the risk of suffering for engaging in crypto activities.</p>



<p><em>“Possible contagion risk within the crypto-asset sector resulting from interconnections among certain crypto-asset participants may present concentration risks for banks with exposure to the crypto-asset sector,” </em>the FDIC wrote adding, ”<em>Susceptibility of stablecoins to run risk can create the potential for deposit outflows for banks that hold stablecoin reserves.”</em></p>



<p>The agency urged financial institutions to carefully consider the risks associated with crypto-related activities before engaging in them. It also said that it will continue to monitor crypto-asset risks and take steps to mitigate them noting that it was working with other federal banking agencies to closely monitor crypto-asset-related activities of banking organizations.</p>



<p>FDIC&#8217;s warning comes even as the crypto market continues to face increased scrutiny from regulators around the world. Last year the crypto sector experienced significant market volatility, exposing several vulnerabilities to banks such as the Silicon Valley Bank and Silvergate, prompting the FDIC to come to their aid.</p>



<p>These risks have prompted <a href="https://zycrypto.com/fdic-issues-cease-and-desist-order-to-okcoin-crypto-exchange/">the FDIC</a> to become increasingly vocal about cryptocurrencies even as more banks angle towards that direction. In April last year, the agency issued a letter requiring all FDIC-supervised institutions requiring them to report any involvement in crypto-related activities to enable it to assess their soundness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In July 2022, the FDIC issued a fact sheet to crypto companies, detailing the risks and concerns associated with misrepresentations and misconceptions about deposit insurance coverage in the context of crypto assets. The fact sheet also provided guidance on risk management and governance considerations for crypto companies.</p>



<p>More recently in January, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve, and the OCC released a joint statement reminding banks to ensure that crypto-asset-related activities are conducted safely and soundly, are legally permissible, and comply with applicable laws and regulations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Notably, since 2022, the FDIC has taken action against more than 85 entities that were misrepresenting the nature, extent, or availability of deposit insurance, including various crypto entities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="1200" height="700" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NYDIG-Predicts-Spot-Bitcoin-ETFs-Could-Unlock-30-Billion-In-Fresh-Demand.jpg" class="attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="NYDIG Predicts Spot Bitcoin ETFs Could Unlock $30 Billion In Fresh Demand" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NYDIG-Predicts-Spot-Bitcoin-ETFs-Could-Unlock-30-Billion-In-Fresh-Demand.jpg 1200w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NYDIG-Predicts-Spot-Bitcoin-ETFs-Could-Unlock-30-Billion-In-Fresh-Demand-300x175.jpg 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NYDIG-Predicts-Spot-Bitcoin-ETFs-Could-Unlock-30-Billion-In-Fresh-Demand-1024x597.jpg 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NYDIG-Predicts-Spot-Bitcoin-ETFs-Could-Unlock-30-Billion-In-Fresh-Demand-768x448.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p><div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div>
<p>Tom Lee, co-founder of research firm Fundstrat Global Advisors, has expressed his belief that the approval of a Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) could <a href="https://zycrypto.com/fundstrats-tom-lee-projects-bitcoin-hitting-an-eye-watering-180000-after-spot-etf-approval/">significantly impact the price of Bitcoin</a>.</p>



<p>In a Wednesday interview with CNBC, Lee suggested that if a Spot Bitcoin ETF were to be approved within the next year, the price of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/morgan-creek-founder-predicts-bitcoin-to-surpass-100000-within-a-year-if-this-happens/">Bitcoin</a> could potentially surge to as high as $180,000. And while the analyst did not provide an exact timeline for the approval, he further noted that the demand for Bitcoin through an ETF could surpass its daily supply, causing the price to experience a substantial increase.</p>



<p><em>“If the spot &#8212; bitcoin gets approved, I think the demand will be greater than the daily supply of bitcoin and so the clearing price- this is done by Shawn Farrell, our crypto digital strategist- is over 150,000, could be like 180,000.”</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ir8jYyrBY5s&amp;ab_channel=CNBCTelevision">Said</a> Lee.</p>



<p>In April, the pundit predicted that Bitcoin&#8217;s price trajectory could witness a remarkable surge, potentially reaching $180,000 before the anticipated halving event in April 2024, partially attributed to the potential introduction of a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/approval-incoming-sec-officially-acknowledges-blackrocks-spot-bitcoin-etf-application/">BlackRock spot ETF</a>.</p>



<p>When asked about his specific price targets for Bitcoin, Lee, however, acknowledged that his forecasts tend to be bold. He clarified that his estimates are influenced by regulatory clarity and developments in the cryptocurrency space. The pundit further highlighted the regulatory status of Bitcoin and Ethereum, arguing that it was relatively straightforward compared to other cryptocurrencies, making them more navigable investment options.</p>



<p>Lee&#8217;s prediction comes amid ongoing discussions and anticipation surrounding the approval of a Bitcoin ETF in the United States. An ETF would provide institutional and retail investors with a more accessible way to invest in Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This potential for increased accessibility has fueled speculation about how such approval could impact the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price. </p>



<p>The discussion surrounding a potential spot Bitcoin ETF in the US remains ongoing, reflecting diverse viewpoints on its potential green light. Recently, Anthony Scaramucci, the founder of SkyBridge Capital, chimed in on the discussion by advocating for the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;We SkyBridge believe the time is long overdue for a spot Bitcoin ETF</em>,” Scaramucci’s firm wrote in an August 14 letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission&nbsp;(SEC). In the letter, the firm contended that executed surveillance-sharing agreements with Coinbase have effectively tackled concerns related to market manipulation.</p>



<p>Despite escalating interest and endorsements, the SEC has persistently denied multiple Bitcoin ETF proposals, citing worries regarding market manipulation and the protection of investors.</p>

<p>The much-anticipated <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-token-falls-11-following-shibarium-deployment-heres-reason-why/">launch of Shibarium mainnet</a>, a groundbreaking Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, has been accompanied by unexpected turbulence, leading to significant price declines in the Shiba Inu ecosystem.</p>



<p>On August 16, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/0-001-shiba-inu-price-in-view-amid-shib-exploding-ecosystem-activity-as-shibarium-debut-beckons/">Shibarium</a> successfully launched on the mainnet after an extensive testing phase involving millions of users and the creation of 21 million wallets.</p>



<p>Shibarium was developed to address Ethereum&#8217;s scalability concerns, including enhancing transaction capacity and reducing expenses. Its introduction on Wednesday hence marked a deliberate move to elevate Shiba Inu beyond its origins as a meme coin.</p>



<p>Shiba Inu gained significant popularity during the 2020-2021 bull market. However, despite briefly surpassing the well-known Dogecoin, SHIB&#8217;s value plummeted just over 90% during the subsequent bear market.</p>



<p>However, the Shiba Inu community remained resilient and established a decentralized ecosystem centred around SHIB. This ecosystem includes ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and a native token, BONE. In the lead-up to the Shibarium mainnet launch, SHIB&#8217;s price experienced an uptick, reflecting optimism within the community.</p>



<p>The network garnered attention from new projects, underscoring its potential influence on the industry. Reports indicated that more than 100 companies were actively developing Shibarium, highlighting the expanding interest in the platform.</p>



<p>However, SHIB and BONE tokens encountered significant price declines following the launch. The plunge came as concerns emerged over a potential hiccup in the launch, with reports suggesting difficulties in recovering assets bridged to the Shibarium network.</p>



<p>Reportedly, some users who sought to transfer their assets from Ethereum to the newly operational network encountered issues that prompted a temporary halt. Notably, Chinese blockchain journalist Colin Wu highlighted that an astounding 965 ETH, valued at $1.7 million, found themselves trapped on the bridge. Supporting evidence from Etherscan substantiated these claims with the Shibarium bridge contract showing a balance of holds 965.3 ETH, equivalent to $1.735 million, in tokens meant to transition from Ethereum to Shibarium.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, issues extended to the Shibarium Remote Control Protocol, which is presently nonfunctional. This setback impeded remote procedures on the network, hampering user interaction and data retrieval efforts.</p>



<p>Furthermore, data from the Shibarium explorer suggests that block production encountered difficulties, causing a 7-hour cessation in blocks. And although block production briefly recommenced, it stalled again before resuming a few hours later.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the value of SHIB has declined, reaching $0.0000085 during the current reporting period, following a 10% decrease over the past 24 hours. Similarly, BONE plunged significantly over 15%, trading at $1.22 at press time.</p>

<p>As the U.S. inches toward the launch of a Bitcoin (BTC) spot exchange-traded fund (ETF), enthusiasts are mulling over the range of benefits to be gleaned by the offering.</p>



<p>A recent report from investment firm Bernstein noted that approval for a spot ETF will offer a seal of legitimacy for Bitcoin and other virtual currencies. The report predicted an influx of institutional capital into the ecosystem, noting that the ETF’s size could be as high as 10% of BTC’s market capitalization in less than three years.</p>



<p>The fallout of an injection of funds into the markets will trigger a price rally for the entire cryptocurrency market following a lengthy bear market.</p>



<p>The report opined that approving one spot bitcoin ETF application by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would open the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/multiple-spot-bitcoin-etf-approvals-on-the-way-cathie-wood-predicts/">floodgates</a> for more applications, akin to the 2021 approval of a BTC future-based ETF.</p>



<p>Aside from price spikes and institutional interests, a spot-based bitcoin ETF could change the landscape for the custody of digital assets. Since the start of the year, there has been a surging demand for institutional-grade <a href="https://zycrypto.com/big-blow-to-crypto-as-nasdaq-scraps-plans-to-enter-custody-business-amid-u-s-regulatory-turmoil/">custody solutions</a>, with the custody space reaching a valuation of over $250 billion.</p>



<p>The SEC has been inundated with <a href="https://zycrypto.com/approval-incoming-sec-officially-acknowledges-blackrocks-spot-bitcoin-etf-application/">applications</a> from leading Wall Street firms seeking approvals to roll out their spot bitcoin ETFs. After a string of regulatory back-and-forth, the securities watchdog extended its review of the application from Ark 21Shares, making it the second extension by the SEC for the application.</p>



<p><em>“With the interest of leading global asset managers in Bitcoin (BTC) spot ETFs and potential mechanisms to address the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) objections, the probability of approval has risen,”</em> read the report.</p>



<p>Several theorists point to the ripple effects of Canada’s Purpose Bitcoin ETF as it racked up over $400 million worth of assets in less than 48 hours after its launch. While the U.S. adopts a slow-and-steady approach, pundits are touting Southeast Asia as the next region to roll out a spot BTC ETF.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-downsides-of-a-spot-etf"><strong>Downsides of a spot ETF</strong></h2>



<p>For all its upsides, critics have warned that offering a spot Bitcoin ETF has several flaws. Perhaps, the most significant downside is the inability of investors to withdraw the underlying instruments, a flaw that runs contrary to the ethos of Web 3.</p>



<p>Another downside is the absence of uniform BTC prices, which could open several market arbitrage opportunities. The SEC remains wary of existing custody solutions and bases its refusal to approve based on insufficient guardrails for investor protection.</p>

<p>Long-term holders are regarded as some of the most stable hands in the cryptocurrency market. These crypto holders are less likely to sell their holdings and more likely to continue accumulating. In the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/fundstrats-tom-lee-projects-bitcoin-hitting-an-eye-watering-180000-after-spot-etf-approval/">Bitcoin market</a>, long-term holders appear to have the upper hand now. </p>



<p>According to data from Glassnode, a leading on-chain analytics platform, most of the existing BTC tokens on the Bitcoin network have been scooped by long-term holders.</p>



<p>Glassnode’s data revealed that in 2023, long-term holders accumulated more Bitcoin than in previous years. At present, 75% of all available Bitcoins are now under the possession of long-term holders. The number of Bitcoins is estimated to sit at a staggering 15 million.</p>



<p>It is worth noting that the accumulation has been building up since 2010. While the data depicts an occasional fluctuation in these holdings, these long-term holders never sold a significant portion of their assets over the last 14 years.</p>



<p>These metrics reflect positively on Bitcoin, strengthening the narrative that adoption amongst key figures has not slowed, despite the constant chaos recorded in the cryptocurrency market.</p>



<p>It also adds to another bullish trend that suggests that the more long-term holders accumulate, the fewer traders hold. With the former being less likely to sell and the latter looking to attain short-term profits, volatility is expected to reduce significantly as more long-term holders take over.</p>



<p>It appears that volatility in the market is already reducing at a notable speed. Glassnode’s most recent on-chain newsletter disclosed that volatility is already at an all-time low and that Bitcoin seems to be in a <em>“bear hangover”,</em> admitting the upsurge in long-term holdings.</p>



<p><em>“Volatility in the digital asset space remains historically low, with investors reaching an all-time low in willingness to spend coins on-chain. The conditions of the Bitcoin market continue to resemble the bear market hangover seen in prior cycles, with an outsized wealth held by long-term high conviction holders.”</em> The newsletter reads.</p>



<p>However, low volatility also comes with its downsides, Glassnode asserts. As volatility reduces, apathy and exhaustion surges amongst market participants. In the long run, a relatively weak influx of demand might follow.</p>



<p>Additionally, Bitcoin’s Realized Cap is slowly moving upwards, suggesting that a sideways market might remain ahead. At the time of this report, Bitcoin is trading for $26,132 as hourly losses continue to surge.</p>

<p>Charles Hoskinson, the founder of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/tag/Cardano">Cardano</a> and a co-founder of Ethereum, has a history of teasing Ethereum and its co-founder Vitalik Buterin, but now he has stepped things up a notch, it seems. A discussion broke out about which ecosystem is better after a question was posted on ‘X’ if Cardano would ever be an Ethereum competitor.</p>



<p>One user said that it was telling that Ethereum had to transition to a 2.0 version of what Cardano already is today. Another argued that Cardano followed Ethereum’s roadmap but was behind by years.</p>



<p>And then came along an ‘X’ user who said he predicted Hoskinson would stop talking about Hydra and look towards things that Ethereum developers are doing, essentially copying from them. He added that Hoskinson would soon say that <em>“Our plan was always that if it works on Ethereum,</em> we can just copy it, and actually,<em> rollups and data availability have always been the future of Cardano too”.</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hoskinson-on-fire"><strong>Hoskinson on Fire</strong></h2>



<p>Charles Hoskinson swallowed the bait and said he felt sorry for people obsessed with their blockchain, saying, “We are living rent-free<em> in the maxi minds. I pity them”.</em></p>



<p>He reminded the original poster that Hydra, one of the recent improvements to the popular blockchain, is live and evolving rapidly.  Additionally, Hoskinson stated that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-gears-up-for-mithril-mainnet-launch-bolstering-network-efficiency-and-versatility-for-ada/">Mithril</a> is now operational, marking the initial move toward an enhanced ADA and light client approach. He explained that innovative transaction methods have been developed, including tiered pricing and Babel fees. Adding that, the concept of a roll-up strategy has been in place since the inception of Midnight four years ago.</p>



<p>He did not only defend Cardano but started to throw punches at Ethereum too, saying: <em>“Meanwhile Ethereum has a dumpster fire of a consensus layer, has a terrible programming model that they can&#8217;t change, and are getting eaten alive by their own layer 2 ecosystem.”</em></p>



<p>No matter whose side you take, it is clear that Cardano is unfinished, and there is no dispute about that. Cardano’s development runs in stages and is now in the second last stage. While the current stage focuses on scaling and resource use, the final stage will see a fully decentralized community-governed ecosystem. Hoskinson thinks by then, Cardano will serve as a blueprint for other blockchains and be <em>“substantially more decentralized than all cryptocurrencies on the market”.</em></p>

<p>The oft-bullish Tom Lee of Fundstrat Global Advisors has shared a prediction for the price of Bitcoin. Lee believes the approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States could steer the classic crypto’s price to over $150,000.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bitcoin-at-180-000"><strong>Bitcoin At $180,000</strong></h2>



<p>Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee is once again singing Bitcoin’s tune and this time proclaiming that the OG cryptocurrency is likely to hit over $150,000 by the end of 2024.</p>



<p>Speaking during an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ir8jYyrBY5s&amp;ab_channel=CNBCTelevision">interview </a>with <em>CNBC’s Squawk Box</em>, Lee suggested that a string of Bitcoin spot ETF approvals would shift Bitcoin’s supply-demand dynamics towards substantial price appreciation. He believes the SEC’s nod on these sought-after investment vehicles has no other choice but to catapult Bitcoin to $150,000, even reaching the $180,000 mark.</p>



<p>&#8220;If the spot Bitcoin [ETF] gets approved, I think the demand will be greater than the daily supply of bitcoin,&#8221; he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ir8jYyrBY5s">said</a>, explaining: &#8220;So the clearing price — this is done by our crypto digital strategist — is over $150,000. It could even be like $180,000.&#8221;</p>



<p>Traditional finance bigwigs <a href="https://zycrypto.com/11-1-trillion-giant-fidelity-renews-push-for-spot-bitcoin-etf/">Fidelity</a>,<a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-etfs-in-motion-an-analysis-of-open-spot-btc-etf-applications-in-the-market/"> Invesco, Wisdom Tree</a>, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ark-invest-gains-edge-in-spot-bitcoin-etf-race-with-epic-surveillance-sharing-maneuver/">ARK Invest</a>, and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/spot-bitcoin-etf-craze-valkyrie-becomes-the-latest-firm-to-apply-for-sec-approval/">Valkyrie </a>followed the world’s biggest asset manager <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-primed-for-trillion-dollar-boost-as-blackrock-expects-landmark-bitcoin-etf-approval/">BlackRock </a>in filing for a physically-backed Bitcoin ETF with the SEC in June. Just last week, the commission pumped the brakes on Cathie Wood’s ARK 21Shares application.</p>



<p>According to Lee, Bitcoin ETFs have gained traction globally, but an endorsement by U.S. regulators would undoubtedly be a huge milestone for the cryptocurrency sector.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-bitcoin-will-still-surge-without-spot-etf"><strong>Why Bitcoin Will Still Surge Without Spot ETF</strong></h2>



<p>Lee further pointed out the connection between crypto assets and the wider economic backdrop. He affirmed that the stabilization of interest rates could usher in more relaxed financial conditions. That could bring upside volatility in risky assets, including cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>But even if a spot Bitcoin ETF does not get greenlighted, Lee still thinks that the flagship crypto still has upside potential due to the upcoming halving event.</p>



<p><em>“You will have a drop in supply again, so the clearing price has to increase. But it won’t be six figures.”</em></p>



<p>Roughly every four years, the Bitcoin rewards awarded to miners for successfully mining a block are slashed by 50% as a way of regulating the blockchain&#8217;s supply economics. The next halving, scheduled for Apr. 26, 2024, will reduce the reward to 3.125 BTC per block from the current 6.25 BTC.</p>



<p>In fact, other pundits have predicted that a $100K BTC price tag could come much sooner than many expect, with Blockstream boss <a href="https://zycrypto.com/pundits-100000-bitcoin-price-target-by-next-halving-sparks-exciting-bet/">Adam Back </a>recently betting that the top crypto will achieve the lofty new high the month before the halving.</p>

<p>Ripple Labs has defended itself against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for years in a case that could define the crypto industry just like the often-cited Howey case—the SEC alleged that Ripple and its executives Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen had sold <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-claps-back-at-secs-request-to-challenge-ruling-that-xrp-isnt-a-security/">XRP as an unregistered security</a>. Now it seems Ripple has to fight not only the SEC but also media misinformation, as many big news outlets reported that the SEC was appealing the ruling that XRP is not a security.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-does-judge-torres-ruling-mean"><strong>What Does Judge Torres’ Ruling Mean?</strong></h2>



<p>Judge Analisa Torres of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York said in her July ruling that XRP in and of itself was not necessarily a security. She also granted the SEC request pertaining to sales of XRP qualifying as securities transactions, namely to institutional investors. Judge Torres stated that approximately $728.9 million of those XRP sold meet the criteria of securities, citing the <em>‘presence of a common enterprise and an expectation of profit’.</em></p>



<p>Both Judge Torres in the SEC vs Ripple case and Judge Rakoff in the Terra-Luna case agreed that the mere existence of an asset does not make it a security by itself, but rather the promise to grow and share profits from an asset turns it into a security. Rakoff also agreed with Torres that an agreement between parties is essential for an investment contract.</p>



<p>During the case, the SEC stated that all XRP sales are securities since the XRP coin itself &#8220;embodies&#8221; all of Ripple&#8217;s promises ever made to any buyer, even if it was just one single buyer. This differentiation was one of the key battles in this case.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-latest-sec-filing-is-and-what-it-isn-t"><strong>What the Latest SEC Filing is And What it isn’t</strong></h2>



<p>Now, even the SEC itself is changing its language, no longer calling cryptocurrencies digital asset securities, as the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/judge-in-ripple-court-fight-grants-secs-appeal-bid-bad-omen-for-xrp/">recent filing</a> states: <em>“The SEC did not argue here or in Terraform that the asset underlying those investment contracts were necessarily a security (and the SEC does not seek appellate review of any holding relating to the fact that the underlying assets here are nothing but computer code with no inherent value).”</em></p>



<p>Regarding the current filing the SEC has made, this is entirely regarding the SEC asking for an expedited appeal about the defendant&#8217;s programmatic and other sales and not about the token XRP itself. The SEC is asking Judge Torres to allow the SEC to make an early appeal with the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, also called an interlocutory appeal.</p>



<p>Notably, the filing is not an appeal and Judge Torres has not granted this motion. It will, however, allow her to explain in detail her reasoning while addressing what Judge Rakoff said.</p>



<p>In legal cases, the losing party can usually appeal unfavourable decisions after the case ends. The SEC says an early appeal is needed because the Ripple case is relevant to other pending cases. Usually, appeals wait till the case ceases to avoid delays. Ripple disagrees with the SEC saying no exception is needed, while Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen say that even if an appeal is granted, the case and appeal can run together.</p>



<p>The ‘case’ refers to whether Garlinghouse and Larsen ‘aided and abetted’ Ripple’s violation of securities laws. This issue is scheduled to go before a jury in 2024.</p>

<p>At the 5th Blockchain Futurist Conference held in Toronto, Shytoshi Kusama, the pseudonymous lead developer of the Shiba Ecosystem, delivered a rousing keynote speech titled &#8220;Dear Humanity.&#8221; The event, which took place from August 15 to 16, saw Kusama addressing the crowd about his bold vision for the cryptocurrency industry and the world.</p>



<p>Kusama&#8217;s speech began by acknowledging the pressing need for change, underscoring the challenges humanity faces due to man-made issues like inflation, rumours of war, and natural disasters. He expressed discontent with the concentration of power among a select few who possess secret knowledge, suggesting that harnessing the collective power of the masses could lead to a brighter future. Central to Kusama&#8217;s vision is the Shiba Inu community, affectionately known as the Shib Army. He emphasized that the strength of this community sets Shiba Inu apart, empowering it to enact lasting change on the global stage.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-memecoin-at-the-edge-of-tomorrow"><strong>A Memecoin at The Edge of Tomorrow</strong></h2>



<p>Challenging the audience to consider the potential impact of a simple meme, Kusama posed the question: <em>Can a joke born as an experiment create a lasting transformation on a worldwide scale?</em> He assured the audience that Shiba Ecosystem would offer cutting-edge technology like other blockchain projects, but the Shib Army&#8217;s commitment to a decentralized future is the true differentiator.</p>



<p>Despite criticism from detractors who spread fears, uncertainties, and doubts (FUD) about the Shiba Ecosystem, Kusama remained steadfast in his vision. While the lead developer refrained from making any Shibarium-related announcements during his brief five-minute speech, he indicated that an announcement might be imminent. Responding to queries about Shibarium&#8217;s launch date, Kusama cryptically stated, <em>&#8220;GOOD question! Let&#8217;s see what we say about that tomorrow,&#8221;</em> leaving the audience in anticipation.</p>



<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-token-falls-11-following-shibarium-deployment-heres-reason-why/">Shibarium</a>, the eagerly anticipated layer-2 scalability solution within the Shiba Ecosystem, took center stage in discussions at the conference.</p>



<p>The Blockchain Futurist Conference, known for its commitment to pushing the boundaries of technology, partnered with Bad Idea AI to ensure that Kusama&#8217;s keynote speech could be delivered without compromising his pseudonymous identity. The event showcased the convergence of cutting-edge technology and visionary ideas, setting the stage for potential transformative developments within the cryptocurrency space.</p>

<p>It has been over two years since Elon Musk announced on what was then Twitter that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/spacex-and-dogecoin-an-uncommon-alliance-to-create-dogestronauts/">Dogecoin would be going to the moon literally</a>. His tweet read: <em>“SpaceX launching satellite Doge-1 to the moon next year – Mission paid for in Doge – 1st crypto in space – 1st meme in space. To the mooooonnn!!” </em></p>



<p>The mission, which would be the first commercial journey to the moon fully paid for in Dogecoin, has since been postponed a few times by SpaceX. The Musk company is the launch provider for the mission, which is a joint task between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Geometric Energy Corporation (GEC), and Intuitive Machines.</p>



<p>The mission named Nova-C/IM-1 is now scheduled for November 15, 2023, with a six-day launch window depending on local conditions, with another window in December. The mission will use a SpaceX Falcon 9 Block 5 to launch the DOGE-1 &amp; IM-1/Nova-C payloads taking off from Kennedy Space Center in Florida.</p>



<p>The CubeSat mission, entirely funded by Dogecoin, will see small satellites circling the moon and collect data via sensors and cameras. Images are going to be broadcast to Earth and will be streamed to Twitch and YouTube.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-doge-co-founder-irritated"><strong>DOGE co-founder irritated</strong></h2>



<p>The founder of Dogecoin was not amused with Musk’s plans for DOGE to become a space-faring coin saying in an interview with Business Insider, &#8220;It all annoyed me because it was this thing that had my name tied to it. I don&#8217;t think people realize it, but I wish that when something happened with Dogecoin and Elon Musk and my Dogecoin co-founder Billy [Markus] that I didn&#8217;t get dragged back into it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer founded Dogecoin as a joke in 2013, and much to their surprise has continued to gain popularity since then. The meme coin, now the 8th largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has had support from celebrities like Snoop Dog and Elon Musk. The owner of X and CEO of SpaceX has often been criticized for posting hype about Dogecoin sending the price upwards.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, DOGE was down with the overall market by about 5%, selling at $0.063, according to CoinMarketCap. This is a long way from the all-time high the popular meme coin was traded for in 2021 when it reached 65 Cents in May of that year. Many in the community may be hoping the launch of DOGE-1 will also send the price of DOGE to the moon.</p>
