Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro explained that he hoped for a positive reception of the proposal by the nations that are part of the bloc.</strong></p>
<h2>Venezuela Officially Applies to Enter BRICS</h2>
<p>Nicolas Maduro, President of Venezuela, announced that the government had already presented an official application to join the BRICS bloc, comprised of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. In a weekly TV program &#8220;Con Maduro Mas,&#8221; Maduro detailed that Venezuela hopes to join the organization to &#8220;learn, support and help&#8221; grow the bloc&#8217;s vision.</p>
<p>Maduro <a href="https://www.telesurtv.net/news/venezuela-solicita-incorporacion-brics-20230801-0016.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Venezuela made its proposal to join the group and we hope it will be positively valued by the nations that integrate it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maduro praised the role of the BRICS bloc in the international geopolitical arena, declaring that it constituted &#8220;the driving force behind the emergence of the multipolar world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Delcy Rodriguez, vice president of the country, <a href="https://sputniknews.lat/20230803/venezuela-formaliza-la-peticion-de-ingreso-del-pais-a-los-brics-1142234228.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> that this application puts Venezuela close to developing new ways of economic cooperation &#8220;away from the unilateral hegemonism.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is expected BRICS will consider adding new members in the next <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-invites-69-leaders-to-august-summit-western-countries-omitted/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">summit</a> to be held in South Africa later this month.</p>

<h2>Venezuela&#8217;s Path to BRICS</h2>
<p>Venezuela&#8217;s intention of trying to enter the BRICS bloc had been revealed by Maduro before. During an official visit to Brazil in May, Maduro stated that Venezuela wished to join the bloc to &#8220;accompany the construction of this new architecture, of the new world that is already being born.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the time, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio &#8216;Lula&#8217; da Silva <a href="https://www.europapress.es/internacional/noticia-lula-defiende-ingreso-venezuela-grupo-brics-20230529221743.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backed</a> Maduro&#8217;s intentions, declaring that he favored Venezuela joining BRICS. He said Venezuela&#8217;s application would be discussed alongside other requests during the next BRICS meeting.</p>
<p>China and Russia also took Venezuela&#8217;s interest positively. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told <a href="https://sputniknews.lat/20230531/rusia-ve-intencion-de-venezuela-de-unirse-a-brics-como-evidencia-de-la-autoridad-del-grupo-1140059862.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sputnik</a> that they welcomed &#8220;the early integration of the largest possible number of party partners to the great BRICS family.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Russian foreign minister for Latin America, Alexandr Schetinin, commented that Maduro&#8217;s statements reflected the &#8220;growing authority that the BRICS are acquiring in the current international situation due to his point of view of what is happening.&#8221;</p>
<p>On July 25, Belarus, which had also applied to join the bloc, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/belarus-says-it-has-applied-join-brics-club-russian-ria-agency-2023-07-25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a> that at least 25 states presented formal requests to be part of BRICS.</p>

The milestone has been reached despite increased regulatory pressure on the world’s largest trading platform for digital assets in the past few months.</strong></p>
<h2>Crypto Exchange Binance Adds 30 Million Users in a Year</h2>
<p>The biggest cryptocurrency exchange by daily trading volume, , now has 150 million registered users, its chief executive unveiled in a tweet on Thursday. In the post, CZ also marked some of the company’s recent successes that came amid heightened regulatory scrutiny of its business operations around the world.</p>
<p>This year, Binance has been targeted by authorities in a number of its established markets. In the U.S., it’s involved in legal battles with the country’s securities and derivatives commissions, which <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-sued-by-cftc-for-alleged-violations-of-trading-and-derivatives-rules/">sued</a> it for breaking laws in their respective fields.</p>
<p>In Europe, the exchange is under <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/french-investigation-targets-binance-allegations-of-money-laundering-and-regulatory-violations/">investigation</a> by French prosecutors for money laundering and was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-ordered-to-cease-all-crypto-services-in-belgium/">ordered</a> by Belgium’s financial watchdog to cease providing crypto services in the country. It also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-withdraws-its-crypto-license-application-in-germany/">withdrew</a> its license applications and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-unit-in-britain-cancels-uk-regulatory-authorization/">canceled</a> its registrations in several countries.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>Despite the challenges on both sides of the Atlantic, Binance has been able to grow its user base by 30 million in the past year. Chinese crypto journalist Colin Wu noted in a <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1687064530239778816" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweet</a> that in July 2022 the exchange said the number of its registered users had exceeded 120 million.</p>
<p>The blogger, better known by his Twitter handle, Wu Blockchain, also quoted data from web analytics firm Similarweb, according to which Binance’s top five sources of traffic in the last three months have been Turkey, Vietnam, Russia, Argentina, and India.</p>
<p>Besides the lawsuits filed by regulators, a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-reportedly-investigated-in-us-for-russia-sanctions-violations/">probe</a> by the U.S. Department of Justice is looking into whether the crypto trading platform has been used by Russians to circumvent sanctions imposed on their country over its military invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>While amid this regulatory crackdown, the market share of Binance’s U.S. subsidiary <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-us-market-share-shrinks-amid-legal-battle-with-sec/">shrank</a> significantly, a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-is-illegal-in-china-binance-does-90-billion-of-business-there-anyway-2a0af975" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> by the Wall Street Journal revealed on Tuesday that Binance users in China exchanged $90 billion of crypto assets in a month, making the country its biggest market. That’s despite a ban on crypto trading since 2021.</p>
<p>In his tweet, CEO Changpeng Zhao also highlighted some of his company’s recent successes. Binance is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-japan-to-launch-with-34-listed-cryptocurrencies/">restoring full services</a> in Japan this month, following the acquisition of a locally registered and regulated exchange in November 2022. It also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-obtains-dubai-license-to-provide-crypto-exchange-services/">obtained a license</a> to provide crypto services in and from Dubai.</p>

Fitch Ratings is one of the top three credit rating agencies in the U.S.</p>
<p>Citic Securities&#8217; chief economist, Ming Ming, told the Global Times on Wednesday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Amid the increasingly complex geopolitical situation today, more and more countries have started the de-dollarization process and Fitch&#8217;s downgrade of the U.S. rating may accelerate that process.</p></blockquote>
<p>In response to Fitch Ratings&#8217; downgrade, both the White House and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen released <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/white-house-yellen-slam-fitchs-us-rating-downgrade-biden-officials-call-it-bizarre-and-baseless/">statements</a> expressing strong disagreement with the decision. Yellen asserted that the change was &#8220;arbitrary and based on outdated data&#8221; while officials from the Biden administration called Fitch&#8217;s downgrade decision &#8220;bizarre and baseless.&#8221;</p>
<p>A growing number of nations globally are actively working to decrease their dependence on the U.S. dollar, particularly after the U.S. <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/dollar-to-play-lesser-role-due-to-its-weaponization-digital-currencies-economist-jeffrey-sachs-says/">weaponized</a> its currency. Leading the efforts towards de-dollarization are the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa). The economic bloc has been pushing for the use of national currencies in trade settlements. De-dollarization is expected to be among the major topics discussed at the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-currency-not-on-agenda-for-leaders-summit-nations-to-focus-on-de-dollarization/">BRICS leaders&#8217; summit</a> that will take place on Aug. 22-24.</p>
<p>“The negative effect of U.S. monetary policy on the world economy is very significant … some countries have been badly hurt by the U.S. monetary tightening,&#8221; Lian Ping, chief economist of Zhixin Investment, told the news outlet.</p>
<p>The chief economist added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fitch&#8217;s downgrade of its credit rating may also be a part of the gradual decline of the U.S. dollar system.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Schiff on US Rating Downgrade, Crash, Dollar Collapse</h2>
<p>Economist and gold bug Peter Schiff warned of a U.S. dollar collapse and the challenges faced by the U.S. economy in a series of tweets this week. His warnings come after Fitch Ratings <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/white-house-yellen-slam-fitchs-us-rating-downgrade-biden-officials-call-it-bizarre-and-baseless/">downgraded</a> the United States&#8217; long-term foreign-currency issuer default rating from AAA to AA+. Fitch is one of the three largest credit rating agencies in the U.S.</p>
<p>Noting that “Fitch downgrading U.S. Treasuries to AA+ from AAA is meaningless, as Treasuries are junk bonds,” Schiff tweeted on Wednesday:</p>
<blockquote><p>When it comes to rating sovereign credit, the primary risk is currency depreciation, not default. Given the trajectory of U.S. government deficit spending, a dollar collapse is inevitable.</p></blockquote>
<p>The rating firm also replaced the &#8220;negative watch&#8221; it <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fitch-maintains-negative-watch-on-us-rating-despite-debt-limit-resolution/">previously placed</a> on the U.S. and assigned a “stable outlook” instead. In a follow-up tweet, Schiff wrote: “Even more ridiculous is that Fitch has the [U.S.] outlook as &#8216;stable.'&#8221;</p>
<p>In another tweet, the economist opined: &#8220;Credit ratings don&#8217;t matter as the U.S. probably won&#8217;t default, but a soaring national debt does matter as the U.S. will print, driving down the value of the dollar. That reduces the real value of Treasuries. If we get hyperinflation that is basically the equivalent of default.&#8221;</p>
<p>Schiff also cautioned that the U.S. economy is on a course toward a crash. The gold bug explained that rising Treasury yields will lead to &#8220;larger federal budget deficits, a weaker economy, a falling dollar, rising current account deficits, higher unemployment, lower stock &amp; real estate prices, a financial crisis, ramped up QE, and higher inflation.&#8221;</p>
<p>He tweeted on Thursday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Treasuries are collapsing as oil prices surge &#8230; Once the dollar falls with Treasuries and gold rises with oil, the party is over. Say goodbye to a soft-landing and brace for impact. Recession + higher inflation = crash.</p></blockquote>

Sorry for the bad news,&#8221; Kiyosaki said.</strong></p>
<h2>Robert Kiyosaki&#8217;s Crash Landing Warning</h2>
<p>The author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, has reiterated his warning about the U.S. economy heading for a “crash landing.” His cautionary message followed the decision by Fitch Ratings, one of the top three credit rating agencies in the U.S., to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/white-house-yellen-slam-fitchs-us-rating-downgrade-biden-officials-call-it-bizarre-and-baseless/">downgrade</a> the U.S. debt rating from AAA to AA+.</p>
<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries.</p>
<p>Kiyosaki tweeted Wednesday:</p>
<blockquote><p>First shoe to drop. Fitch rating services downgrades U.S. credit rating from AAA to AA+. Brace for crash landing. Sorry for the bad news yet I have been warning for over a year the Fed, Treasury, big corp CEOs have smoking fantasy weed. Take care.</p></blockquote>
<p>The famous author has been warning about an impending economic crash for quite some time. In May, he stated that he believes the U.S. economy is headed for a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-us-economy-headed-for-crash-landing-financial-pandemic-started-corruption-high/">crash landing</a>, rather than a soft landing or a hard landing as some economists have suggested. Last month, he said that a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosakis-warnings-giant-crash-incoming-end-of-us-dollar-approaching/">giant crash is coming</a> and the end of the U.S. dollar is approaching. He emphasized that he still recommends gold, silver, and bitcoin, noting that these three investments are the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-warns-about-stocks-bonds-mutual-funds-says-bitcoin-best-for-unstable-times/">best for unstable times</a>.</p>
<p>This week, Kiyosaki said the U.S. <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-warns-us-economy-not-strong-america-broke-says-he-still-prefers-bitcoin/">economy is not strong</a> and America is broke. He further predicts an<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-warns-more-banks-are-about-to-fail/"> increase in bank failures</a>, attributing blame to the Biden administration and the Federal Reserve for destroying regional banks. Kiyosaki warned that regional banks are being <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-says-regional-banks-are-being-wiped-out-calls-fed-criminal/">wiped out</a> due to Fed policies. Moreover, he anticipates that the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) will introduce a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-warns-us-dollar-will-die-citing-brics-nations-plan-to-launch-gold-backed-currency/">common currency</a> that will kill the U.S. dollar.</p>

According to an article quoting knowledgeable sources, the company seeks to encourage user engagement on its social media platforms with the chatbots that could also be used to collect more user data.</strong></p>
<h2>Meta Seeks to Seize on Chatbot Hype, Challenge Competitors With ‘AI Agents’</h2>
<p>Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, is gearing up to present in the next few weeks a number of AI-based chatbots designed to exhibit different personalities, the Financial Times wrote this week, quoting people familiar with the tech conglomerate’s plans.</p>
<p>The company has been designing prototypes that can take the form of different characters and have discussions with the 4 billion users of its social media platforms, according to the sources, who also revealed that the chatbots have been dubbed “personas.”</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta</a> explored creating one that emulates Abraham Lincoln and another that advises on travel options in the style of a surfer. The chatbots, which will support a new search function and offer recommendations, could launch as soon as September, according to one of the quoted individuals.</p>
<p>FT noted that the move comes as the company seeks to attract and retain users in the face of a stiff competition from platforms like Tiktok. Apparently, Meta also tries to seize upon the hype around AI that spread since the launch of Openai’s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/openai-announces-chatgpt-app-for-android-devices/">Chatgpt</a> in November, 2022.</p>
<p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during an earnings call last Wednesday that he envisaged AI “agents that act as assistants, coaches or that can help you interact with businesses and creators.” He believes they can help companies with customer service or to increase staff productivity. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>We don’t think that there’s going to be one single AI that people interact with.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Zuckerberg is spending all his energy and time on ideating about this,” one of the persons that spoke with the Financial Times unveiled. He also said that in the longer term developing an avatar chatbot in the metaverse would be explored.</p>
<p>Others in this space have already launched chatbots that feature personalities. Andreessen Horowitz-backed start-up Character.ai, for instance, uses AI technology to generate conversations in the style of Elon Musk or Nintendo character Mario.</p>
<p>Besides boosting engagement, Meta’s chatbots could be employed to collect more data on users’ interests, the article points out. And with most of the company’s $117 billion in revenues coming from advertising, they can help it to better target users with more relevant content and advertising. That, however, raises privacy concerns, the authors note.</p>

The U.S. government, however, takes a different stance, and prosecutors contend that Bankman-Fried “went beyond benignly exercising a constitutional right to speak to the press.”</strong></p>
<h2>U.S. Government Calls for Bail Revocation of Former FTX CEO</h2>
<p>Upon facing <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sam-bankman-fried-seeks-to-avoid-jail-denies-witness-tampering-in-ftx-case/">allegations of witness tampering</a> after disclosing Ellison&#8217;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ex-alameda-ceo-caroline-ellisons-google-docs-diary-exposes-struggles-prior-to-ftx-collapse/">private journal entries</a> to the New York Times, Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s legal team asserted that it was within his constitutional rights. Bolstering their claim, they submitted an expert affidavit from a Harvard Law School professor, who also maintained Bankman-Fried&#8217;s right to communicate with the media. Additionally, the New York Times defended the former FTX CEO&#8217;s ability to disseminate statements through news outlets in a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590939/gov.uscourts.nysd.590939.187.0.pdf">letter</a>.</p>
<p>Dated August 2, 2023, and addressed to judge Lewis Kaplan, David McCraw penned the letter on behalf of the New York Times Company. He emphasized the significance of adhering to SDNY Local Criminal Rule 23.1&#8217;s two provisions, asserting that doing so is crucial for safeguarding the public&#8217;s First Amendment right to obtain information about financial misconduct. The letter&#8217;s tone implies apprehension regarding potential limitations on freedom of expression and public access to details on FTX case legal proceedings.</p>
<p>In response to McCraw and the New York Times&#8217; correspondence, the Department of Justice (DOJ) vehemently countered with <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940.188.0.pdf">another missive</a> declaring that Bankman-Fried exceeded his First Amendment rights. While conceding that both parties agree Samuel Bankman-Fried divulged Caroline Ellison&#8217;s confidential writings to the newspaper, the DOJ contends it was a deliberate effort to manipulate public opinion about her and, consequently, himself. The letter states:</p>
<blockquote><p>What is clear—regardless of whether the defendant was the first source for stories regarding Ellison—is that the defendant, rather than deny his guilt as he correctly now says it is his right to do, shared materials with the press obviously designed to intimidate, harass, and embarrass someone he knows is slated to testify against him, and to provoke an emotional response in potential jurors and color a potential juror’s view of that witness.</p></blockquote>
<p>Following the court&#8217;s reprimand of the defendant, it is implied there may be sufficient grounds to suspect that he committed or attempted a federal felony such as witness tampering or attempted witness tampering. The prosecution describes Bankman-Fried&#8217;s actions as surreptitious measures intended to wrongly discredit a trial witness and influence the jury pool — acts portrayed as exceeding his legitimate constitutional right to engage with the press.</p>
<p>The letter argues that rather than an &#8220;abrupt reversal of course,&#8221; the government maintains a consistent response to Bankman-Fried&#8217;s escalating defiance of his bail terms. The prosecution&#8217;s unequivocal request is spelled out: they demand revocation of Bankman-Fried&#8217;s bail and hope to see him detained at the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) until the commencement of his trial.</p>

Hovering perilously close to dipping beneath the $40 billion threshold, the total value locked (TVL) in defi hangs on by a thread. Concurrently, the market of defi tokens has endured a sharp 12.55% decline in value in just the span of a single day.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Decentralized Finance&#x2019;s Dark Summer: Hacks, Scams, and Lower Token Values</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Decentralized finance (defi) endured a chaotic summer, culminating in July 2023 as a nightmarish month filled with exploits, hacks, and scams, <a href="https://twitter.com/CertiKAlert/status/1685972350393573376?s=20">according</a> to an X post published by Certik. Adding to the turmoil, the defi community watched in dismay as Curve Finance fell victim to a $62 million hack, owing to a <a href="https://hackmd.io/@LlamaRisk/BJzSKHNjn">security vulnerability</a> in Curve&#x2019;s liquidity pools that manifested on July 30th, 2023.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
At this juncture, the defi token economy&#x2019;s valuation stands at a precarious $44.12 billion, having hemorrhaged 12.55% against the U.S. dollar in just one day. For example, in the turbulent span of the past seven days, avalanche (AVAX) witnessed a decline of 4.92%, chainlink (LINK) suffered a loss of 9.17%, aave (AAVE) dipped by 10.21%, and Curve&#x2019;s native token CRV tumbled down by 15.58%.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In this volatile market, wrapped bitcoin&#x2019;s (WBTC) market valuation commands a significant slice &#x2014; amounting to $4.73 billion &#x2014; of the defi token economy, even though WBTC&#x2019;s supply has been exhibiting a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/navigating-the-wrapped-bitcoin-landscape-86000-wbtc-exit-circulation-in-one-year/">contracting trend</a> lately. Amidst the upheaval, three defi tokens that have navigated the storm this past week are telos (TLOS), maker (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/MKR" 312046  target="_blank">MKR</a>), and sushiswap (SUSHI).&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The broader crypto economy has been mired in a downturn, but the situation grew particularly dire with the July hacking spree, including the substantial Curve Finance breach, instigating profound uncertainty within the defi ecosystem. Throughout 2023, the total value locked (TVL) in defi has managed to hold above the $40 billion mark. However, as the decentralized finance ecosystem faces intensifying strains, this threshold might soon be in jeopardy.&#13;<br />

<h2>Coinbase Fights Back Against SEC&#8217;s Crypto Exchange Lawsuit</h2>
<p>In a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.599908/gov.uscourts.nysd.599908.36.0.pdf">court filing</a> submitted on Friday, Coinbase contends the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-becomes-the-latest-target-of-sec-accused-of-unregistered-brokerage-and-securities-violations/">SEC&#8217;s claims</a> rely on an overbroad reading of the term &#8220;investment contract&#8221; that departs from decades of precedent and statutory text. The crypto-centric company says the SEC fails to allege the transactions facilitated on its exchange include any contractual rights entitling buyers to future profits or income from issuers, an essential element of an investment contract.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today, <a href="https://twitter.com/coinbase?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@coinbase</a> filed our brief asking the Court to dismiss the SEC’s case against us. Our core argument is simple — we do not offer &quot;investment contracts&quot; as that term has been construed by decades of Supreme Court and other binding precedent. 1/3 <a href="https://t.co/r2EkDgkEuc">https://t.co/r2EkDgkEuc</a></p>
<p>&mdash; paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) <a href="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1687435194247303168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 4, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The motion asserts the SEC&#8217;s theory &#8211; that buyers of certain tokens expect profits based on issuer efforts to boost the tokens&#8217; usefulness &#8211; impermissibly treats these assets like securities. Further, Coinbase invokes the major questions doctrine, under which courts defer substantial regulatory actions to Congress absent clear authorization.</p>
<p>Coinbase argues the SEC is claiming vast authority after admitting it lacks this power, even as legislators actively debate apportioning crypto oversight.</p>
<p>“The SEC has violated due process, abused its discretion, and abandoned its own earlier interpretations of the securities laws,” the court filing details. “But there is a more fundamental problem with its case—one the chair recognized two years ago and that entitles Coinbase to judgment on the pleadings now: The subject matter falls outside the agency’s delegated authority.”</p>
<p>Additionally, Coinbase contests the SEC&#8217;s claim it acted as an unregistered broker by providing its wallet software. Coinbase argues the wallet is merely a passive tool allowing users to store assets they control, not a means of effectuating transactions. The SEC&#8217;s allegation that Coinbase&#8217;s staking services are unregistered securities also fails, Coinbase’s lawyers claim. The company says Coinbase’s role in staking is merely technical, not managerial.</p>
<p>Overall, Coinbase paints the SEC&#8217;s action as an unjustified, dramatic reversal that defies the agency&#8217;s own past positions and comes amid ongoing legislative efforts to regulate digital assets. It urges the court to find the SEC transgressed its boundaries and dismiss the case.</p>
<p>“The SEC has overstepped its statutory authority, and the case should accordingly be dismissed,” Coinbase said. &#8220;For the foregoing reasons, Coinbase is entitled to judgment on the pleadings.”</p>

This flaw could have allowed attackers to bypass strict identification measures and operate an Orb, a device used to collect users&#8217; iris information. The revelation comes amidst existing complaints regarding Worldcoin&#8217;s data collection practices in Bavaria, France, and Kenya, and from a prominent German political figure.</strong></p>
<h2>A Breach in Worldcoin&#8217;s Iris Verification Orb Amid Global Concerns Over Data Privacy</h2>
<p>Certik <a href="https://twitter.com/CertiK/status/1687129300179243010?s=20">disclosed</a> on August 3, 2023, that it discovered a security vulnerability in Worldcoin&#8217;s verification process. The vulnerability would have enabled a malicious attacker to become an Orb operator without the need for proper identification or a vetting interview. In a typical scenario, only legitimate businesses that pass Worldcoin&#8217;s stringent identification process can run an Orb operation.</p>
<p>The Worldcoin security team promptly acknowledged the vulnerability and issued a fix, the blockchain and smart contract auditor detailed. <a href="https://www.certik.com">Certik</a> has since verified that the fix successfully mitigated the threat, preventing any potential exploitation of the system. Details of the finding and the methods used to rectify the issue will be disclosed in the future, the team noted.</p>
<p>Certik emphasized that its investigation and disclosure of the vulnerability were part of a standard whitehat procedure. It emphasized that the firm is not associated with Worldcoin, and the discovery was made as part of its regular auditing and analysis of blockchain and smart contract technologies.</p>
<p>The Certik vulnerability news has added fuel to the ongoing debate over Worldcoin&#8217;s data collection practices. Complaints have emerged from several regions, including <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bavarias-data-protection-office-launches-probe-into-worldcoins-iris-scanning-data-practices/">Bavaria</a>, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-french-privacy-regulator-probes-worldcoins-biometric-data-practices/">France</a>, and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/kenyan-government-says-it-has-suspended-worldcoin-activities/">Kenya</a>. These concerns focus on the potential misuse of personal data collected through the Worldcoin platform.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/DrChristinaBaum">Christina Baum</a>, a member of the German political party Alternative for Germany (AFD), has been vocal in her criticism of Worldcoin&#8217;s practices. She <a href="https://www.afd.de/christiana-baum-per-augen-scan-zur-digitalen-identitaet/">stated</a>, &#8220;These devices are used solely for the global monitoring of people.&#8221; Baum&#8217;s quote encapsulates the growing mistrust and dissatisfaction surrounding Worldcoin&#8217;s data collection methods.</p>
<p>Baum believes that Worldcoin’s practices “make it possible to permanently track all activities of a single person &#8211; purchasing behavior, movement behavior, health, and much more.” The AFD member also argued that as far as the biometric data collected, “no one knows” where the data is stored and who it&#8217;s stored by.</p>
