With the Trump NFTs declining both in price and in transaction volume, the NFT collection seems to be struggling for its existence.</p>
<h2>Donald Trump&#8217;s NFT Price Fall</h2>
<p>According to data compiled by <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://opensea.io/collection/trump-digital-trading-cards?search%5BsortAscending%5D=true&amp;search%5BsortBy%5D=UNIT_PRICE" rel="nofollow">OpenSea</a>, a platform that monitors the market for <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/nft-non-fungible-token/">non-fungible tokens (NFTs)</a>, the value of digital trading cards featuring Donald Trump has dropped by 72% in the past few days; after prices for the cards skyrocketed to nearly 350% upon launch.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://coingape.com/donald-trumps-nft-trading-cards-pump-350-in-value-upon-launch/">Donald Trump’s NFT Trading Cards Pump 350% In Value Upon Launch</a></em></p>
<p>The trading volume for Trump&#8217;s NFTs, which was developed on the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> scaling network <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/polygon-matic/">Polygon</a>, reached its all-time high on December 17, according to data provided by CryptoSlam. At the time, the volume breached the $3.5 million mark. On the OpenSea website, sales of Trump digital trading cards have also decreased from a peak of 6,661 on December 17 to barely 529 on December 22 and 260 on December 23.</p>
<p>On Monday, however, the trading volume decreased by 57% to about $836,000 in <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/" rel="nofollow">ETH</a>, with the average sale price falling close to $466. Currently, the NFTs have suffered a decline of 72% with each card now worth only 0.23 ETH or $280, as of December 24. Although, the one silver lining for its initial investors &#8212; those who bought them at $99 during launch &#8212; still enjoy a decent profit margin of 182%.</p>
<h2>Trump’s First NFT Launch</h2>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> released an official statement that he will be making a &#8220;big announcement&#8221; via his <a href="https://coingape.com/donald-trump-unbanned-on-twitter-but-is-not-willing-to-come-back-heres-why/">Truth Social</a> website. Many analysts speculated that this announcement might be related to his potential candidature for the presidency in 2024.</p>
<p>However, it turned out to be Trump&#8217;s first stint with NFTs, where he was quoted saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>My official Donald Trump Digital Trading Card collection is here! These limited edition cards feature amazing ART of my Life &amp; Career! Collect all of your favorite Trump Digital Trading Card</p></blockquote>
<h2>Mixed Reception On Trump NFTs</h2>
<p>The NFTs got a mixed reception from the crypto community with some mocking the artworks while others applauding the former <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/united-states/">United States</a> president to be among the few politicians pushing the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/web-3-0/">Web3 narrative</a>.</p>
<p>While speaking to the OAN network regarding the NFTs, Donal Trump stated that: &#8220;You know, it&#8217;s sort of comic book art when you think of it, but they showed me the art and I said, gee, I always wanted to have a 30-inch waist.&#8221;</p>

However, the collapse of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a> and the subsequent crypto crash made it worse for the market. Meanwhile, as 2023 approaches, analysts expect that the top cryptocurrency would show clear signs that it around the bottom level. The question remains that at what point in 2023 would BTC regain the $30,000 that it saw earlier in the year.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Price To Recover In Six Months?</h2>
<p>The crypto crash due to <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/terra-luna/">Terra LUNA</a> collapse brought the BTC price down to below $30,000 level. It has only been a downward curve since then for the top cryptocurrency. BTC hovered around the $25,000 level for few weeks when Ethereum network was preparing for the Merge. In this context, crypto analysts are predicting that BTC could recover to $37,000 level until June 2023, as per technical analysis.</p>
<p>According to influencer <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKL5Kqw7pT4" rel="nofollow">Crypto Michael</a>, the recovery is far by a few months into 2023.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Most likely BTC could be acting around $37,000 in a few months from now when it comes to Bitcoin price action. Because we are just going to copy the markets from 2018 and 2019 and also considering that it had such a downward movement already.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

Meanwhile, it is also the case with altcoin market, making it unpredictable for traders looking to book profits. As of writing, BTC price stands at $16,845, up 0.15% in the last 24 hours, according to price tracking platform <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" rel="nofollow">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>

However, the Cardano project witnessed a great deal of success in terms of the increasing number of new crypto wallets, as it grew by 22,000 since early January.</p>
<h2>Promising Technical Indicators</h2>
<p>Even though, bears have majorly remained in command and may continue to suppress ADA prices for some time, the cryptocurrency is showing signs of great strength in the longer time horizon. Technical indicator, such as the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">relative strength index (RSI)</a>, is now located at 82.82, which depicts an overbought zone. This is a possible sign of a trend reversal for the ADA token &amp; may bring the long-running bear trend to an end.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132895" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/24183346/ADA-USD-4-hour-price-chart-source-TradingView-1024x464-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="464" /></p>
<p>Furthermore, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD indicator</a> also seems to favor the price of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/cardano-ada/">ADA</a>, as lately it&#8217;s been on an upward trend, signaling an upcoming bullish sentiment.</p>
<h2>Mass Whale Accumulation</h2>
<p>Touted as the &#8220;Ethereum-killer&#8221;, Cardano has observed an increase in the proportion of the altcoin&#8217;s supply held by investors with large <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-wallets/">wallets</a>. According to the information provided by the behavior analysis platform Santiment, the number of key Cardano sharks hoarding ADA tokens has been on an upward trajectory since June of 2022.</p>

And they have taken this level of dip buying to a new level since the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FTX?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#FTX</a> fallout in early November.

<p>Since the <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-ftx-exchange-files-for-bankruptcy/">collapse of the FTX exchange</a> in early November, prices of c<a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">ryptocurrencies</a> have been largely affected by the growing negative market sentiment. But, large wallet addresses have taken dip buying to a whole new level. According to the data, since November 7th, 2022, $83 million worth of ADA has been transferred to wallet accounts holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ADA tokens.</p>
<h2>Cardano&#8217;s Growing Ecosystem</h2>
<p>The Cardano ecosystem has lately been making headlines with new developments and product launches. Quite recently the Cardano team restarted the testing of its native <a href="https://coingape.com/cardano-news-first-stablecoin-djeds-launch-date-announced/">DJED stablecoin</a> with enhanced features. The project also showed explosive growth in the number of Plutus Scripts, which is a Cardano-based <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/smart-contract/">smart contract</a> platform.</p>

<p>Moreover, Cardano&#8217;s co-founder and CTO <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/charles-hoskinson/">Charles Hoskinson</a> has previously outlined the company&#8217;s intentions for Midnight, a privacy-centric blockchain that will include a confidentiality architecture to address the issue of smart contract privacy.</p>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/nft-non-fungible-token/">NFT</a> is another such sector where the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> rival Cardano has made notable advancements. The price of &#8220;Cardano Apes&#8221; NFTs has lately skyrocketed due to an unprecedented increase in demand. According to the most recent information, &#8220;Cardano Ape Francisque&#8221; sold for a staggering $250,000, thus pitching them in direct competition with the highly successful Bored Ape NFTs.</p>

Here&#039;s What Analysts Predict" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" /><p>Ethereum price is holding strongly above the $1,170 support level and looks <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bull-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bullish</a>. Moreover, crypto analysts and on-chain data experts also consider that buying Ethereum near $1,170 would be a good price to buy for the long term. A Santa Claus rally can push the ETH price above $1,300, but traders contemplate whether a rally will happen or not as the year was not good for the crypto market.</p>
<h2>Investors Remain Positive on Ethereum Price Rally</h2>
<p>Ethereum (ETH) price is currently trading above $1,200, as per <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">CoinMarketCap</a>. Since November, the ETH price is bouncing off the $1,170 level, trying to rally over $1.3K. The most important thing to note here is that the ETH price is in upward momentum since November and holds above $1,200 mostly.</p>
<p>According to on-chain data, Ethereum reserves of crypto exchanges fell sharply since September this year. The Ethereum Exchange Reserve for All Exchanges metric indicates the ETH reserves on <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/centralized-cryptocurrency-exchanges-cex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">centralized exchanges</a> have declined by more than 30%.</p>
<figure id="attachment_132893" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132893" style="width: 739px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-132893" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/24180840/Ethereum-Exchange-Reserves.webp" alt="Ethereum Exchange Reserves" width="739" height="465" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-132893" class="wp-caption-text">Ethereum Exchange Reserves. Source: CryptoQuant</figcaption></figure>
<p>Thus, it indicates that investors are accumulating and are more bullish on Ethereum. The investors have withdrawn large amounts from centralized exchanges and are likely to hold ETH for the long-term.</p>

<p>Crypto analyst <a href="https://coingape.com/ethereum-price-prediction-analyst-suggest-best-level-buy-eth/">Michael van de Poppe also suggested</a> to investors that $1,190 would be a good level for longs on Ethereum. However, despite the positive signs from the markets, indices as well as the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) show weakness. A fall in DXY below 104 or <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/whale-accumulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whale accumulation</a> could confirm a massive rally.</p>
<p>Crypto analyst Rekt Capital suggests that investors can buy Ethereum near $1,170 for the long term. Bitcoin price holding above $17,150 will be key for confirmation of an upcoming rally.</p>

<h2><b>Samsung’s investing in Latam</b></h2>
<p>Many businesses have begun to advertise their goods and brands in the <a href="https://coingape.com/blog/what-is-metaverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">metaverse</a> because they see it as an essential component of their marketing plans. One of the largest electronics companies in the world, Samsung, recently disclosed that it is devoting more than $35 million to Latam customers&#8217; metaverse initiatives.</p>
<p>The Metaverse is a vision that many in the computer industry believe will be the next iteration of the Internet. However, where people experience life in ways they could not in the physical world. Many companies, including Sony, Microsoft, and others, are already using Metaverse, and Samsung has now joined the fray.</p>
<h3><b>Younger Audiences in Focus</b></h3>
<p>The marketing vision presented by Samsung justifies Samsung&#8217;s focus on the metaverse and the amount of money invested in this area.  Furthermore, according to a Linkedin study, the various Metaverse platforms currently have an active audience of 400 million monthly users, 51% of whom are 13 years of age or younger.</p>
<p>The barriers that currently separate the virtual and real worlds will undoubtedly not exist in the world that this younger generation creates in the future. However, which means there will be many opportunities to build together.</p>

<p>Samsung&#8217;s interest in the <a href="https://coingape.com/year-ender-top-3-metaverse-trends-to-watch-of-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">virtual world</a> is not new.

This holiday season, an unanticipated stocking stuffer might be a <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/nft-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">non-fungible token</a></strong>. An NFT is a particular kind of blockchain-based <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cryptocurrency</a> asset. But it&#8217;s important to document the ownership status of digital objects. Even though anyone can view the item, only the purchaser of an NFT is authorized to claim ownership of it.</p>
<p>NFTs have become more and more well-liked in the past year as the cost of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has skyrocketed. Both cryptocurrencies and NFTs are gaining popularity as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<h3>Land on the sandbox could make a good Christmas gift</h3>
<p>Some people who give gifts express the hope that their loved ones will learn about NFTs or that the token will make a wise investment. There are numerous justifications for why someone would want to buy NFT for a loved one. They have the option of receiving a plot of land in <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/decentraland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Decentraland</a> or The Sandbox or buying expressive NFT artwork. An NFT-based digital product will be a unique gift for any recipient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>How do you give a Christmas NFT gift?</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s not quite as easy to buy something, wrap it, and put it under the tree to give an NFT, but it can still be done in three easy steps:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Create a digital wallet</li>
<li aria-level="1">Purchase the NFT</li>
<li aria-level="1">Send your gift</li>
</ul>

<h2>3 Reasons Why NFTs might make perfect Christmas gifts this year</h2>
<h3>Scarcity</h3>
<p>One of the main draws for collectors is the rarity of NFT crypto art. Collectors can track an NFT&#8217;s origin by using distinctive identifiers on them, which can assist them in finding a one-of-a-kind work of art. This is particularly crucial because many NFTs already exist as digital works that were produced elsewhere. The rarity of NFT crypto art can increase the value of a work of art, particularly if it is a one-of-a-kind creation.</p>
<h3>Liquidity</h3>
<p>Giving the liquidity of NFT crypto art this holiday season is a wise choice. Although many people have heard of cryptocurrency and blockchain, they might not be familiar with how they operate. NFT crypto art is a good way to learn about these new technologies for those who have a more technical bent. It is not affected by the supply chain problems that come with physical goods. For those who don&#8217;t have a lot of time to shop, NFT can also make a wonderful Christmas gift.</p>
<h3>Future cash flow</h3>
<p>Many people are shocked by the price increases, so getting a friend or member of your family a Future cash flow crypto art piece would make a thoughtful gift. The <a href="https://coingape.com/nft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">popularity of NFTs</a>, or network-based tokens, is to blame for the price increase.</p>
<p>Over the past year, the market for these tokens has grown rapidly; according to some projections, it will reach $3 trillion by 2021. Since prices have increased as a result, the non-fungible tokens are now worth $10 billion. Even though investing in these tokens has many advantages, the holiday season is a great time to introduce cryptocurrency to your loved ones.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>NFT crypto art is a fantastic Christmas present for a number of reasons. NFTs combines the worlds of collecting and gambling. Some of the more popular NFTs, like those with cartoon characters, are ideal for kids. The NFT market is expanding daily, much like <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoins</a> and other cryptocurrencies. Aside from regular people, celebrities are also investing in NFT.</p>

However, the <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-lawsuit-will-sec-turn-over-hinman-speech-documents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC already lost its assertion</a> over the doc and surrendered them to the Ripple and defendants.</p>
<h2>Can SEC Still Save Hinman Doc in XRP lawsuit?</h2>
<p>According to the latest filings in the XRP lawsuit, the SEC is still in pursuit of <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-news-sec-shielding-hinman-doc-whale-move-275-mln-xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protecting the Hinman docs </a>even after losing the key battle. Meanwhile, this time the commission is asking the court to not make the memos public.</p>
<p>The SEC has asked the court to keep the emails out of public view or else the docs would be “foreclosed” from making “such argument” in the future. <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ripple-vs-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read More XRP Lawsuit News Here</a></strong></p>
<p>This can be another round of the SEC going to fight over the Hinman Docs as it is expected that the judge might order to unseal docs. The Commission would again bring up the Deliberative Process Privileges (DPP) and Attorney Client Privilege (ACP) in the XRP lawsuit. However, the commission has lost its argument over these docs around 6 times till now.</p>
<h2>What SEC can do here?</h2>
<p>Experts following the XRP lawsuit suggest that SEC may choose to file their interlocutory appeal at this time. Attorney<a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/attorneyjeremy1/status/1606393413439561735" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"> Jeremy Hogan suggested</a> that the commission might have 60 days from the date of the order to not seal the emails.</p>
<p>Attorney added that this might happen quicker than expected as the commission needs to appeal before the Summary Judgment ruling. However, the other expectation is that Judge Torres gives a ruling on sealing issues and Summary Judgment at the same.</p>

Also, former Terra Rebels developers Edward Kim and Zaradar have released their first proposal, shared by Edward Kim on the classic agora on Saturday.</p>
<h2>Terra Classic Developers Form New Team, Submits Proposal</h2>
<p>Terra Classic core developers Edward Kim and Tobias &#8220;Zaradar&#8221; Anderson quit the developer group Terra Rebels after a dispute with recent funding. In fact, Terra Rebels group which had over 25 members was reduced to just 12 members.</p>
<p>Tobias Anderson earlier hinted that he will be working in a <a href="https://coingape.com/lunc-news-terra-classic-developers-edward-kim-zaradar-to-work-together/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new group with Edward Kim</a> and the formation of the Oversight Committee. Core developer Edward Kim in a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/edk208/status/1606493630264492032" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">tweet</a> on December 24 announced the new proposal, asking the community to share comments and suggestions on the L1 task force proposal.</p>
<p>According to the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://classic-agora.terra.money/t/joint-l1-task-force/49108" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">proposal</a>, Terraform Labs had a team of 6-8 senior L1 <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blockchain</a> developers. Therefore, he proposes to hire 3 full-time L1 blockchain developers to complete tasks in the next 4 to 6 months. The team will move to more innovative and long-term advancements after finishing the pending tasks.</p>
<p>The proposed team will have three members from the community such as Zaradar, Edward, and Till. The proposal noted that these contributed significantly to the revival of Terra Classic. It includes re-enabled staking, re-enabled delegation, and introduced burn tax. Additionally, a part-time assistant and two junior developers will be required.</p>
<p>The total budget for the first quarter of 2023 is $141.75k. This would be about 0.991 billion LUNC tokens. Notably, the distribution of payments will happen monthly after approval from the Oversight Committee, and approval from Terra Grants Foundation signers of the multisig.</p>
<p>The detailed proposal was supported by Terra Classic influencers such as ClassyCrypto, Crypto King, and Cryptifer. Moreover, the Terra Classic community appreciates the proposal.</p>
<p>LUNC price is also increasing in the last 24 hours as fear subdues in the community. The LUNC price is currently trading at $0.0001459, up nearly 6% in the last 24 hours.</p>

<h3 style="color: #252525">Hardware Wallets</h3>
<p style="color: #252525">In recent months, the need for a<a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/hardware-wallets-are-they-safe/"> hardware wallet</a> has become even more obvious. There has never been a better time to regain financial control. Hardware wallets make self-custody simple and secure, allowing you to confidently enjoy ultimate financial freedom.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132856" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/24144043/Hardware-wallets.png" alt="Hardware wallets" width="800" height="600" /></p>

As many people have learned the hard way over the past year, it is difficult to choose those whose value will increase. However, the world of finance will be revolutionized by NFTs and the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blockchain</a> technology on which they are based.</p>
<p>Everyone was shocked in 2021 when collections of these images occasionally sold for millions of pounds. However, even ardent NFT supporters would concede that the frothy NFT market needed a correction. The purchase of NFTs was not even stopped by celebrities. However, only a tiny minority of investors saw a return on their investment. On their <a href="https://coingape.com/top-5-popular-nft-tokens-to-invest-in-december-2022/">NFT investment</a>, many of them suffered millions of losses. The famous people who lost money in NFT will be discussed in this article.</p>

<h2>Top 5 Celebrities Who Lost Millions In NFTs</h2>
<h4>Logan Paul</h4>
<p>At the height of multi-million pound NFT sales last year, the notorious YouTuber jumped on the bandwagon. It now appears this eagerness has cost him a small fortune.</p>
<p>An NFT Paul bought for $623,000 (£558,000) is now only worth $10 (£9), which is barely enough to pay for a pint of beer in a busy London pub. But that NFT is only a small portion of the vast collection he gathered over the previous year, during which he spent over $2.5 million (£2.24 million). This NFT&#8217;s decline over time has been 60% from its peak.</p>
<h4>Steve Aoki</h4>
<p>Steve Aoki is a producer and DJ of electronic music known for his boisterous EDM bangers. Additionally, he had established himself in the cryptocurrency community as a reputable non-fungible token creator and collector.</p>
<p>However, these investments have not yielded the same level of success as his music. Aoki has observed a sharp decline in the value of the assets he owns, including eight <a href="https://coingape.com/aggregatorapps/bored-ape-yacht-club/">Bored Ape NFTs</a> and more than one hundred NFTs altogether. Even though diversification allowed him to limit his losses, one of the &#8220;Doodles&#8221; NFTs he purchased in January for about $346,000 is now only worth $42,000, per DappRadar&#8217;s estimates.</p>
<h4>Snoop Dog</h4>
<p>The American rapper, who spent US$7.09 million on an NFT called Right-click and Save as Guy, holds the record for the most expensive celebrity NFT purchase.</p>
<p>But according to Open sea, the rapper also owns another non-fungible token called Crypto Punk, which was purchased for US$1.1 million and is currently estimated to be worth $688,251.</p>
<h4>Neymar Jr.</h4>
<p>The Brazilian football sensation, like many other sports figures, reportedly spent over $1 million (£900,000) on two NFTs from the Bored Apes Yacht Club, which is regarded as one of the most coveted non-fungible token collections, earlier this year.</p>
<p>Sadly, Neymar has paid a high price for belonging to this exclusive club. According to DappRadar, a website that tracks NFT values, his two apes, which he purchased in January for approximately $480,000 and $570,000, are now worth $153,000 and $171,000, respectively. The football player now faces potential paper losses of over $700,00.</p>
<h4>Marshmello</h4>
<p>In October 2021, DJ Marshmellow, a well-known DJ around the world, joined the NFT Trend. For an estimated $1.4 million AUD, he purchased KajuKing #1680. His non-fungible token is listed on OpenSea for a pitiful $AUD 2137 just over a year later. Between the two, there is a startling $AUD 1.4 million difference.</p>
<h3>Nearly 60% of NFT Trading Volumes in 2022 Was Wash Trading</h3>
<p>According to a recent report, wash trades accounted for nearly 60% of the non-fungible token trading volumes this year. Wash trading is a type of market manipulation in which a trader buys and sells a security to simulate increased trading volume and activity in the market.</p>
<p>Wash trades, according to Dune, gained traction in the crypto industry in 2019. However, it became relevant to the NFT space in 2022. Dune revealed that wash trades account for approximately 45% of all non-fungible token trading volume on <a href="https://coingape.com/price/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a>.

There has been a substantial increase in the burn rate this month, making the rise in the burn rate in the last 24 hours more significant. Could this be the start of the Christmas rally for Shiba Inu?</p>
<h2>Shiba Inu Burn Rate Rises Massively in 24Hr</h2>
<p>According to the Shibburn <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.shibburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">website</a>, <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">27,291,662 Shiba Inu (</span><span class="r-18u37iz">SHIB)</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> tokens were burned in the last 24 hours. Only 4 transactions contributed to taking out significant tokens out of Shiba Inu circulating supply.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_132833" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132833" style="width: 316px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-132833" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/24121649/screenshot-www.shibburn.com-2022.12.24-12_15_07.png" alt="Shiba Inu burn" width="316" height="281" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-132833" class="wp-caption-text">Shiba Inu Tokens Burned.

<p>In an effort to reduce the massive supply of the crypto industry&#8217;s top meme cryptocurrency, a Shiba Inu <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/whale-accumulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whale</a> sent 24,091,662 SHIB to the burn address. The whale still has over 312 billion Shiba Inu tokens. The Etherscan data also show that the whale is an active buyer of SHIB.</p>
<p>Recently, several Shiba Inu whales send SHIB tokens to the dead address. As earlier reported by CoinGape, SHIB has re-emerged on the list of the ten largest assets held by <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> whales, according to the digital wallet tracker WhaleStats. Millions of SHIB tokens have been burned, with Shiba Inu whales sending massive amounts in single transactions.</p>
<p>Moreover, Shiba Inu has reemerged as the top 10 purchased tokens among the 500 biggest Ethereum whales in the last 24hrs. The top 2000 whales are holding over $50 million in Shiba Inu tokens.</p>
<h2>Can SHIB Price Rally?</h2>
<p>Shiba Inu price is trading at $0.000008283, trading sideways in the last 24 hours. The SHIB price is up 2% in a week, indicating the possibility of an upside move.</p>
<p>The 24-hour low and high for SHIB are $0.00000827 and $0.000008342, respectively. <a href="https://coingape.com/shiba-inu-coin-shib-finally-ready-big-2023-rally/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Traders expect a rally</a> in Shiba Inu as a result of the Santa Claus rally.</p>

In terms of how quickly society adopts new technologies, the entertainment sector—which includes everything from radio to television—plays a significant role. However, in addition to movies, the entertainment industry also encompasses other forms of entertainment like sports and music. As the twenty-first century and the internet era begin, things are changing very quickly. When 3D first became popular, people had a hard time accepting it. Avatar, a movie, has, however, completely transformed this field. It illustrated a novel kind of world, or perhaps we should say it marked the start of a <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/blog/what-is-metaverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">metaverse</a></strong>.</p>
<p><iframe title="What The Metaverse Means For The Future Of Cinema" width="678" height="381" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3o6AcylsxS4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 3D entertainment industry spread its popularity throughout the world after Avatar. With the advent of new technology, the metaverse will completely change the entertainment sector. The metaverse is a virtual world that users can access through <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/blog/metaverse-devices-best-gears-to-enter-the-fictional-universe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VR headsets</a></strong>, in case they&#8217;ve been living under a rock. However, the metaverse isn&#8217;t a game; rather, it&#8217;s an interactive virtual environment. Some have dubbed it the next step in the development of the internet.</p>
<h2><b>5 Ways the Metaverse Might Transform the Entertainment Sector</b></h2>
<h3>Live Sports</h3>
<p>The next development in sports entertainment may be the metaverse. Any devoted supporter will tell you that sports are more than just a game. More of the stadium experience could be captured by taking part in a live sporting event within the metaverse than by merely watching a match on television.</p>
<p>Not all sporting events will be replaced by the metaverse. Fans will continue to travel from all over the world to events like the World Cup to watch their team compete. The metaverse, however, may be able to bring a live experience closer to those who are unable to travel.</p>
<h3>Interactive storytelling and movies</h3>
<p>Interactive movies are already being investigated by numerous businesses. A list of Netflix&#8217;s interactive video specials was provided by <a href="https://coingape.com/price/polygon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Polygon</strong></a>. Even though they can be a lot of fun, interactive stories of today frequently consist of a series of straightforward yes-or-no questions. However, complex plots with multiple paths may someday be used in metaverse storytelling.</p>
<p>Imagine watching a movie where you are one of the main characters rather than just the hero. Video games and traditional media could converge in interactive movies in the metaverse.</p>
<h3>Actual VR Gaming</h3>
<p>In the past few years alone, <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/year-ender-top-3-metaverse-trends-to-watch-of-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VR gaming</a></strong> has advanced significantly, and headsets have become both more accessible and well-liked. Many excellent VR games, such as Half-Life: Alyx, show the world what a triple-A VR experience could look like, even though many games still feel like tech demos.</p>
<p>The metaverse might develop into a center for VR gaming. The collaborative nature of the metaverse allows it to combine the community and interaction of an MMO with the immersion of the most immersive triple-A action games.</p>

<h3>Virtual Concerts</h3>
<p>A live performance that can be viewed online is referred to as a virtual concert. They are broadcast on specialty platforms like Song Kick and MelodyVR in addition to streaming websites like YouTube and Facebook Live. Fans buy tickets to see their preferred musicians perform live in the metaverse. They are granted access to watch the Virtual Concert live after paying for a ticket.</p>
<p>Virtual people are no longer constrained by physical boundaries in the Metaverse. By altering the surroundings in the virtual world, a performer can create a new stage or quickly switch between outfits during a virtual concert.</p>
<h3>Interaction in the Metaverse</h3>
<p>Some people believe that virtual collaboration will eventually move into the virtual world. In fact, the CEO of Meta <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/tag/mark-zuckerberg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark Zuckerberg</a></strong> has already held a number of important business meetings in the Virtual world.</p>
<p>However, metaverse events aren&#8217;t only found at work or in the classroom. There are already a lot of social hubs in the metaverse where users can congregate and communicate. Some people are already experimenting with metaverse dating, and the virtual world might someday have a thriving nightlife scene.</p>
<p>Families and friends who live far apart may be able to communicate through the metaverse. Putting together a virtual talent show could be a great way to engage in some enjoyable family time.</p>
