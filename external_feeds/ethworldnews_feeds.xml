<p>Paul Grewal, the Chief Legal Officer at Coinbase Global Inc. is set to testify before the United States House Committee on Agriculture later today. As the legal chief for the largest crypto exchange in the United States, Grewal will emphasize the need for clear regulations for the crypto industry. The lawyer will also underscore the importance of the Digital Asset Market Structure discussion draft, which was <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/u-s-lawmakers-regulatory-crypto-bill/">introduced</a> by House Republicans last week. </p>



<h2><strong>Coinbase: Proposed Bill Needed For Balanced Crypto Regulations</strong></h2>



<p>Paul Grewal took to Twitter recently to inform his followers about his upcoming appearance on Capitol Hill. The Coinbase executive also shared a <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/we-need-clear-rules-for-crypto-to-protect-american-leadership-and-consumers" rel="nofollow noopener">summary</a> of the testimony that he plans to deliver before the Congressional committee. Grewal stated that he will use the opportunity to present his company’s views on the Digital Asset Market Structure Discussion Draft, which was unveiled by House Agriculture Committee Chairman G.T. Thompson and Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry last week. </p>



<p>Grewal stated that his testimony would revolve around three key topics: The U.S. falling behind due to a lack of clear regulations leading to the departure of crypto innovation, Crypto is solving real-world problems, and a clear path is needed in order to protect responsible innovation, and that the Digital Asset Market Structure bill is a strong step towards regulatory clarity for the crypto industry.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Coinbase believes the Digital Asset Market Structure Discussion Draft is a good first step in developing a workable and balanced regulatory regime designed for crypto.” </p><cite>Paul Grewal, Chief Legal Officer at Coinbase</cite></blockquote>



<p>Paul Grewal plans to highlight the developments made in the European Union, the UK, Singapore, and China (through Hong Kong) in terms of crypto regulation, translating to a potential threat to the United States&#8217; economic future and national security. The Coinbase executive will also highlight how the Discussion Draft will benefit and protect the over 20% of Americans that own and use crypto assets.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>The judge overseeing Genesis Global’s bankruptcy case has extended its mediation period.&nbsp;</li><li>FTX’s request to join the court-appointed mediation talks has been denied by bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane.&nbsp;</li><li>Arguments on FTX’s $3.9 billion claim, which was previously denied by the bankrupt crypto lender, will be heard next week.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>In a major victory for Genesis Global Holdco, the judge overseeing its bankruptcy case has granted its request for an extension of the court-appointed mediation process. The bankrupt crypto lender’s confidential mediation sessions, which were attended by its parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG) and creditors, including the Winklevoss-owned crypto exchange Gemini, have been extended in order for the parties to come up with a revised plan to pay its creditors.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Genesis Judge Denies FTX’s Request To Join Mediation Talk</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-05/genesis-judge-rejects-ftx-demand-to-join-crypto-bankruptcy-talks" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane has allotted more time for Genesis to come up with a payout plan along with some of its biggest creditors including Gemini. The outcome of this court-appointed mediation period, which has been extended to June 16, 2023, would form the basis of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan that would dictate the repayment to the bankrupt crypto lender’s creditors. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>There will be a certain amount of radio silence because mediation needs that to work. Shortening the mediation does not shorten the case.” </p><cite>Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane</cite></blockquote>



<p>Judge Lane further ruled that FTX, which claims to be Genesis’ largest unsecured creditor with a whopping $3.9 billion in outstanding claims, cannot join the <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-object-to-genesis-mediation-extension/">mediation process</a> which began last month. Genesis previously estimated FTX’s multi-billion dollar claim at zero and asked the judge to set up a months-long process to recalculate the value of FTX’s claims. The bankruptcy judge will deliver a ruling in this matter at a hearing scheduled for next week. </p>



<p>The bankrupt crypto lender also owes more than $1.1 billion to Gemini’s Earn Users. Genesis’ request for an extension of the mediation period drew opposition from some of the Earn Users last week. However, Gemini assured its customers that an extension of the mediation period would not cause any delay.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>A judicial panel has ordered the consolidation of the lawsuits against FTX’s financial backers and celebrity promoters.&nbsp;</li><li>A multi-district litigation has been created before a U.S. District Judge in Miami, the bankrupt exchange’s former headquarters.&nbsp;</li><li>The latest decision came after the plaintiffs requested the creation of a multi-district litigation last month.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>In a small victory to FTX’s victims, the numerous lawsuits against the Bahamas-based bankrupt crypto exchange’s investors and promoters have been consolidated before a single federal judge in Florida, United States. The consolidation came after a judicial panel ordered the creation of a multi-district litigation, something that the plaintiffs had requested last month during a hearing in Philadelphia.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Multi-District Litigation Against FTX Can Reduce Costs, Fast Track Resolution</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/ftx-s-celebrity-vc-backers-to-face-consolidated-suits-in-miami-1.1929093" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, a judicial panel ordered the consolidation of the lawsuits against FTX’s financial backers and celebrity endorsers before U.S. District Judge Michael Moore in Miami earlier today. The judicial panel picked Miami for the multi-district litigation, given that it served as the crypto exchange’s headquarters before it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November last year. </p>



<p>The numerous lawsuits and class-actions filed against venture capital and private equity firms, including Sequoia Capital and Thoma Bravo have been consolidated. These firms were sued by <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/met-museum-new-york-return-ftx-donations/">FTX</a> customers for enabling co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried by investing in his crypto venture. The multi-district litigation also includes the lawsuits filed against the bankrupt crypto exchange’s celebrity promoters, including NFL star Tom Brady, NBA Hall of Famer Shaquille O’Neal, and Shark Tank host Kevin O’Leary. While FTX has been protected from litigation since it filed for Chapter 11 in Delaware, the protection doesn’t extend to third parties that allegedly enabled the exchange’s activities. </p>



<p>The multi-district litigation is expected to reduce costs associated with the legal proceedings by eliminating duplicative pre-trial document exchanges and providing a venue for test trials to weigh the value of claims. The MDL was requested by lawyers representing the plaintiffs during a hearing last month. The lawyers argued that the sheer amount of lawsuits against FTX-affiliated parties had made the litigation “unwieldy.”. </p>

<ul><li>Tether has joined El Salvador’s Volcano Energy project to develop a Bitcoin mining farm.&nbsp;</li><li>The billion-dollar project aims to tap into El Salvador’s renewable energy sources to support sustainable Bitcoin mining.&nbsp;</li><li>The stablecoin giant clarified that its investment in Volcano Energy will not utilize or impact the reserves that support USDT.&nbsp;</li><li>The latest move is in line with Tether’s recent push towards energy innovation and sustainable BTC mining.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Tether, the crypto giant behind the world’s largest stablecoin, has made a sizable investment in El Salvador’s Volcano Energy. Volcano Energy is a $1 billion venture to establish a Bitcoin mining farm powered by renewable energy. The billion-dollar project aims to integrate solar and wind projects in Metapán’s volcanic region to create a 241-megawatt renewable energy generation park.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Tether: Investment In Volcano Energy Will Not Impact USDT Reserve</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://tether.to/en/tether-participates-in-1-billion-investment-to-build-the-worlds-largest-bitcoin-mining-farm-in-el-salvador/" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> from Tether earlier today, the stablecoin giant invested an undisclosed amount in Volcano Energy’s first funding round of $250 million, paving the way for developing one of the world’s largest Bitcoin mining farms. A spokesperson for the stablecoin firm declined to confirm if the investment was being made in the form of USDT. The spokesperson assured that the investment would not utilize or impact the reserves that back its USDT stablecoin. </p>



<p>The site chosen by Volcano Energy for the billion-dollar renewable energy park is located in Metapán’s El Chiste region, which will be divided between 169 MW of photovoltaic solar energy and 72 MW of wind energy. The combined 241 MW output will create an initial computation power of over 1.3 EH/s. Tether stated that it will provide capital as well as expertise in energy, hardware, and communications to help develop Volcano Energy’s new facility.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We are excited to be among the initial pioneers of renewable energy in El Salvador as an equity investor and advisor. This investment continues Tether’s journey in diversifying its strategic ecosystem.” </p><cite>Paolo Ardoino, Chief Technology Officer at Tether. </cite></blockquote>



<p>The USDT issuer’s latest investment is in line with its recent push toward energy innovation and sustainable BTC mining. Last week the firm <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/tether-btc-mining-in-uruguay/">invested</a> in energy production and the launch of sustainable Bitcoin mining operations in Uruguay. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The New York Metropolitan Museum is set to return over half a million dollars donated by bankrupt crypto exchange FTX in March and May of 2022.</li><li>Court documents noted that the Museum will return the FTX donations in full and without further litigation.</li><li>Commentators believe the move is meant to distance the museum from the FTX debacle and possible legal implications. </li><li>The crypto exchange is also making efforts to claw back funds donated to entities and political candidates while founder Sam Bankman-Fried controlled the once multi-billion dollar crypto empire. </li></ul>



<p>The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City is set to <a href="http://chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.deb.188450/gov.uscourts.deb.188450.1562.0.pdf" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.deb.188450/gov.uscourts.deb.188450.1562.0.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">return</a> $550,000 in donations it received in March and May last year from FTX’s U.S. entity West Realm Shires Services, court documents show.</p>



<p>Under founder Sam Bankman-Fried, the bankruptcy crypto exchange donated millions of dollars to firms, entities, and political candidates through a system of affiliates. </p>



<p>The Met&#8217;s decision to return the funds is part of a larger effort to distance itself from the controversy surrounding FTX. The move has been praised by some as a demonstration of the museum&#8217;s commitment to ethical fundraising practices. However, others have criticized the decision, arguing that it sets a potentially problematic precedent for other cultural institutions.</p>



<p>This is not the first time that the Met has returned donations. In 2018, the museum returned a $1 million donation from the Sackler family, who were involved in the production of OxyContin.</p>



<h2>FTX Donation Headache</h2>



<p>The bankruptcy estate made efforts to recover donations made to political candidates and other donors after taking over in November last year. While it&#8217;s unclear if and how these donations might be returned, charges against Bankman-Fried like fraud and campaign finance violation indicate a need for donors to assess the funds they received from FTX. </p>



<p>FTX&#8217;s founder Sam Bankman-Fried is awaiting trial on 13 counts including defrauding customers and investors. SBF pleaded &#8220;not guilty&#8221; to most of the charges while other former execs like Caroline Ellison and Nishad Singh tried to reach plea deals with federal prosecutors. </p>



<p>SBF is under home arrest on a $250 million bail bond pending trial proceedings this October. </p>



<p>In other news, the U.S. Justice Department Trustee branch is pushing for a <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/trustee-insists-ftx-independent-examiner/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/trustee-insists-ftx-independent-examiner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">court-appointed independent examiner</a> to dig into FTX&#8217;s books and file a report like in the case of Celsius. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The SEC claims that Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao violated U.S. laws by knowingly operating an unlicensed securities exchange.</li><li>Several tokens like SOL, ADA, and MATIC were labeled securities by the federal regulator in its suit against Binance.</li><li>CEO Zhao replied “4” calling the lawsuit FUD and the crypto exchange said it’s ready to “defend our platform vigorously” in an official response to the SEC’s claim.</li></ul>



<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is <a href="https://www.docdroid.net/I02zzqT/sec-v-binance-4-pdf" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.docdroid.net/I02zzqT/sec-v-binance-4-pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">suing</a> Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao for breaking securities laws and commingling billions of customers funds in a U.S. entity controlled by Zhao. </p>



<p>Per the lawsuit, Binance and its executives knowingly operated an unlicensed securities exchange in the U.S. The court documents filed at a federal court reference a quote from a former Chief Compliance Officer who allegedly admittedly in December 2018 to running an illegal securities exchange on American soil &#8211; <em><strong>&#8220;we are operating as a fking unlicensed securities exchange in the USA bro&#8221;.</strong></em></p>



<p>The SEC&#8217;s suit against Binance also raises concerns for the classification of crypto assets in the future. Indeed, the suit issued the securities label for a basket of cryptocurrencies including BNB, BUSD, SOL, ADA, MATIC, FIL, ATOM, SAND, MANA, ALGO, AXS, and COTI. </p>



<p>The news follows speculations that CEO Zhao otherwise known by his initials CZ could step down as CEO. Cryptocurrency prices slid on the back of the news with Bitcoin (BTC) and the total crypto market cap both down over 5% in a matter of hours. BTC dipped below $25,000 and tokens like SOL recorded double-digit losses at press time.</p>

<h2>Binance Responds</h2>



<p>CZ tweeted &#8220;4&#8221; shortly after the news broke, essentially calling the lawsuit FUD and said that the Binance team was maintaining steady operations for users. <a href="https://nansen.ai/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://nansen.ai/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nansen</a> data showed over $69 million in net outflows following news about the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/sec-complaint-aims-to-unilaterally-define-crypto-market-structure-8707489117122437402" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/sec-complaint-aims-to-unilaterally-define-crypto-market-structure-8707489117122437402" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official response</a> from Binance said the suit serves as an example of the SEC&#8217;s &#8220;misguided and conscious refusal to provide much-needed clarity and guidance to the digital asset industry.&#8221; Binance denied that user assets have ever been at risk and said the company is ready to &#8220;defend our platform vigorously.&nbsp;&#8220;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Today’s action is another in a line of examples where, as with other crypto projects facing similar suits, the Commission has determined to regulate with the blunt weapons of enforcement and litigation rather than the thoughtful, nuanced approach demanded by this dynamic and complex technology. Unilaterally labeling certain tokens and services as securities – even ones over which other U.S. authorities have asserted jurisdiction – only compounds these problems.</p></blockquote>



<p>The SEC&#8217;s filing shadows a lawsuit from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/27/binance-and-founder-changpeng-zhao-sued-by-cftc-for-allegedly-violating-trading-rules.html" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/27/binance-and-founder-changpeng-zhao-sued-by-cftc-for-allegedly-violating-trading-rules.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alleging</a> that Binance violated American derivatives laws. Several crypto entities like Coinbase and Kraken have also been the subject of enforcement action from U.S. regulators across federal and state lines. </p>



<p>Previous <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/prosecutors-fraud-charges-binance-cz/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/prosecutors-fraud-charges-binance-cz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports</a> also suggest that more enforcement actions against Binance, CZ, and other crypto players could be on the way as U.S. regulators tighten the noose around crypto.</p>

<p>Cross-chain services across 11 chains remain suspended as the team announced last month. These chains include Kekchain, PublicMint, Dyno Chain, Red Light Chain, Dexit, Ekta, HPB, ONUS, Omax, Findora, and Planq.</p>



<p>Monday&#8217;s activity spurred speculations that CEO Zhaojun possibly made contact with the team. Rumors previously suggested that police in China arrested Zhaojun and other core members of Multichain&#8217;s team. </p>



<h2>Multichain Bridge Breakdown</h2>



<p>Users first reported abnormal activity and stuck transactions on May 21, prompting exits from investors like Haskey and ecosystem stakeholders like Fantom in the following days. Uncertainty surrounding the cross-chain protocol reached a fever pitch after the team claimed a &#8220;Force Majeure&#8221; was the cause for delayed transactions. </p>



<p>The team also went silent amid rumors that CEO Zhaojun was arrested in Chain although the news was never confirmed. MULTI&#8217;s market value fell 60% during this period and exchanges like Binance <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/deposits-halted-binance-multichain/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/deposits-halted-binance-multichain/" rel="noreferrer noopener">halted</a> deposits/withdrawals for Multichain-bridged tokens</p>



<p>On May 31, the Multichain (formerly Anyswap) team suspended service to 11 cross-chain bridges. The notice said that Zhaojun was still unreachable at the time and could not approve server access needed for protocol maintenance. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>TerraUSD creator Do Kwon secured his $428,000 bail from a Montenegro court in a third round of judiciary negotiations.</li><li>The initial approved order from a Basic Court was previously voided by a High Court arguing flight risks and Do Kwon&#8217;s abundant resources.</li><li>Courts in Montenegro could issue a five-year sentence to the former Terraform executives if convicted on travel paper forgery charges.</li><li>South Korean and U.S. governments have requested Kwon&#8217;s extradition after his multi-billion dollar crypto juggernaut crashed last summer.</li></ul>



<p>A Montenegro court <a href="https://sudovi.me/ospg/sadrzaj/VLVL" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://sudovi.me/ospg/sadrzaj/VLVL" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">granted</a> bail worth $428,000 each for Terraform Founder Do Kwon and former CFO Han Chang-Joon after a High Court voided the initial approval. </p>



<p>Kwon and Han were arrested in March just before they boarded a private plane flying to Dubai in the UAE. The former Terraform Labs executives were detained with allegedly forged passports and travel documents. An Interpol Office in Brussels confirmed that the documents were fake while South Korean authorities confirmed Kwon&#8217;s identity after an ID was examined. </p>



<p>A lawyer representing Kwon and Han requested bail in the amount of 400,000 euros for each individual. Prosecutors <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwon-bail-appealed-montenegro/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwon-bail-appealed-montenegro/" rel="noreferrer noopener">countered</a> that the amount was insignificant and raised flight risk concerns. The request was <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/terrausd-do-kwon-granted-bail-montenegro/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/terrausd-do-kwon-granted-bail-montenegro/" rel="noreferrer noopener">approved</a> by a Basic Court in Podgorica a day after and <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwon-bail-denied-montenegro-high-court/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwon-bail-denied-montenegro-high-court/" rel="noreferrer noopener">annulled</a> by a Montenegro High Court nearly a week later.</p>



<p>The latest court approval means that Do Kwon will be released after paying $428,000 in bail pending a court hearing on June 16. A Montenegro court could sentence Kwon to five years in prison if prosecutors secure a conviction on forgery charges. </p>



<h2>Do Kwon&#8217;s Charges</h2>



<p>Elsewhere Do Kwon faces criminal prosecution in at least the U.S. and South Korea. Governments from both countries requested Do Kwon&#8217;s extradition from Montenegro. It&#8217;s undecided where prosecutors will first get to arraign Kwon although <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/prosecutors-do-kwon-extradition/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/prosecutors-do-kwon-extradition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South Korean authorities are pushing for extradition</a>.</p>

<ul><li>FTX has filed an objection to the mediation extension proposed by Genesis Global.&nbsp;</li><li>As Genesis’ largest creditor, the crypto exchange took issue with not being included in the mediation process.&nbsp;</li><li>The bankrupt exchange has also objected to having its unliquidated claims estimated at zero by Genesis.</li></ul>



<p>FTX Trading Ltd. and its debtor-affiliates have joined a group of creditors of bankrupt crypto lender Genesis Global to oppose the extension of the mediation period proposed by the latter. Claiming to be Genesis’ largest unsecured creditor, the Bahamas-based bankrupt crypto exchange filed an objection to Genesis’ proposed mediation extension.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>FTX Objects To Genesis Marking Down Its $3.9 Billion Claim</strong></h2>



<p>According to the <a href="https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/reIlzLM9ae4Q/v0" rel="nofollow noopener">filing</a> made with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York earlier today, the FTX debtors asserted that they were the largest creditors in Genesis’ Chapter 11 proceedings with claims of a whopping $3.9 billion. The filing was made in response to a motion filed by Genesis Global late on Thursday night, which sought to estimate the FTX debtors’ claims at $0.00. </p>



<p>FTX stated in the filing that Genesis’ motion was filed without any advance notice to the bankrupt crypto exchange and its affiliated debtors. Genesis described the motion as critical in order to avoid undue delay and “expeditiously pursue confirmation of a chapter 11 plan”. FTX highlighted that the Chapter 11 plan in question remained undisclosed and was under negotiation among creditors in the mediation party that were hand-picked by Genesis.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The mediation is a waste of estate resources without the inclusion of the FTX Debtors and should not continue without the FTX Debtors’ involvement.” </p><cite>FTX Trading and affiliated debtors</cite></blockquote>



<p><a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-prosecutors-drop-criminal-charges-sbf/">FTX</a> also took issue with not being included in Genesis’ court-appointed mediation process that took place in May. The mediation process included other parties to the bankrupt crypto lender’s Chapter 11 process including Genesis&#8217; parent firm Digital Currency Group and the Winklevoss-owned crypto exchange Gemini. FTX’s objection to the mediation extension was accompanied by over a dozen other parties who are owed millions by Genesis. A hearing on the mediation extension is scheduled for June 5, 2023. </p>

<ul><li>Marathon Digital’s Bitcoin mining output in May is up 77% from the previous month.&nbsp;</li><li>The Bitcoin mining firm mined a record 1,245 BTC during May 2023 thanks to increased hash rates and transaction fees.&nbsp;</li><li>The Bitcoin miner has increased its Unrestricted Bitcoin Holdings to 12,259 BTC, worth roughly $333 million.&nbsp;</li><li>Marathon’s stock (MARA) surged by almost 7% following the latest mining metrics.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Bitcoin mining giant Marathon Digital has reported optimistic metrics for the month of May 2023. The Fort Lauderdale-based firm mined 77% more BTC in May as compared to the previous month. The increase in mining output was attributed to surging hash rates and transaction <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bitcoin-fees-2-year-high-as-brc-20/">fees</a> thanks to the growing popularity of Bitcoin ordinals. The Bitcoin miner revealed that in some cases transaction fees were so high that they exceeded the 6.25 BTC block reward. </p>



<h2><strong>Marathon Digital’s Share Price Up 7%</strong></h2>



<p>According to the unaudited Bitcoin production and miner installation updates <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/06/02/2681012/0/en/Marathon-Digital-Holdings-Announces-Bitcoin-Production-and-Mining-Operation-Updates-for-May-2023.html" rel="nofollow noopener">published</a> by Marathon Digital Holdings, the Bitcoin mining firm mined 1,245 BTC during May 2023, marking a 77% increase from April. The latest BTC addition brought the firm’s year-to-date mined BTC number to 4,141 BTC. The bitcoin miner also increased its operational hash rate by 9% to 15.2 EH/s and installed hash rate by 13% to 20.1 EH/s in May. The Bitcoin miner has increased its Unrestricted Bitcoin Holdings to 12,259 BTC, worth roughly $333 million. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>With the construction of Applied Digital’s facility in Ellendale, ND progressing and optimizations across our fleet continuing, we believe we are on track to reach our 23 EH/s target near the middle of this year.” </p><cite>Fred Thiel, Chairman and CEO of Marathon Digital Holdings</cite></blockquote>



<p>Marathon’s CEO Fred Thiel stated that apart from the Bitcoin mining operations, the firm also collaborated with Brink to raise nearly $800,000 for Bitcoin core developers, of which $500,000 was contributed by the Bitcoin miner. The latest Bitcoin mining metrics had a bullish impact on Marathon Digital’s stock (MARA). The share price gained nearly 7% after the numbers for May 2023 were released. At the time of writing, the stock was trading at $10.03.&nbsp;</p>
