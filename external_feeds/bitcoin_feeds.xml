Decentralized bitcoin is freedom,&#x201D; the lawmaker said.</strong></p>
<h2>Arizona Lawmaker Wants to Make Bitcoin Legal Tender</h2>
<p>Arizona State Senator Wendy Rogers has introduced several crypto-related bills, including one to make bitcoin legal tender in her state.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Launched my crypto bills today,&#x201D; Rogers tweeted Tuesday. The bills are co-sponsored by her state senate Republican colleagues Jeff Weninger and J.D. Mesnard.</p>
<p>One of the bills proposes <a href="https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/56leg/1R/bills/SB1235P.pdf">making bitcoin legal tender</a>. The legislation defines the cryptocurrency as &#x201C;the decentralized, peer-to-peer digital currency in which a record of transactions is maintained on the bitcoin blockchain and new units of currency are generated by the computational solution of mathematical problems and that operates independently of a central bank.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Another bill proposes allowing state agencies to enter &#x201C;into an agreement with a cryptocurrency issuer to provide a method to accept cryptocurrency as a payment method of fines, civil penalties or other penalties, rent, rates, taxes, fees, charges, revenue, financial obligations, and special assessments to pay any amount due to that agency or this state.&#x201D;</p>


<p>Rogers introduced a similar bill to make bitcoin legal tender in Arizona last year but it was quickly shot down. She tweeted last April:</p>
<blockquote><p>Centralized digital money controlled by the central bankers is slavery. Decentralized bitcoin is freedom.</p></blockquote>
<p>In September 2021, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/first-day-bitcoin-legal-tender-el-salvador-buys-the-dip-countrys-btc-stash-grows/">El Salvador</a> became the first country to adopt bitcoin as legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar. Since then, the country, led by the pro-bitcoin president Nayib Bukele, has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/el-salvador-buys-80-more-bitcoin-as-btc-fell-below-19k-president-insists-bitcoin-is-the-future/" target="_self" rel="noopener">purchased</a> thousands of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC</a> for its treasury. Last November, Bukele announced that El Salvador is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/el-salvador-to-buy-bitcoin-every-day-starting-tomorrow-president-says/" target="_self" rel="noopener">buying bitcoin every day</a>.</p>

The matter has been discussed during a recent visit to Iran where officials have also signaled interest in such an initiative.</strong></p>
<h2>Iran and Russia Talk Stablecoin Payments for Bilateral Trade Settlements</h2>
<p>The Russian Federation is considering the creation of a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stablecoin.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stablecoin</a> backed by gold that can be employed for cross-border settlements, including with Iran, the chairman of the Financial Market Committee at the lower house of Russian parliament, Anatoly Aksakov, told the Parlamentskaya Gazeta newspaper.</p>
<p>“We discussed the issuance of stablecoins, digital financial assets (DFAs) backed by certain valuables. For example, I spoke about gold, gold bars, refineries can provide them, or centers where gold is stored, and DFAs are issued against these reserves,” the lawmaker explained after a visit by a Russian delegation to the Islamic Republic.</p>
<p>Such a stablecoin can then be used as a means of payment, in mutual settlements between Russia and Iran for example, Aksakov elaborated, also quoted by the Interfax news agency. He added that the proposal has been received with interest from the Iranian side.</p>

<p>The high-ranking member of the State Duma further noted that Iran has a large debt for goods supplied by Russia. At the same time, the Iranian currency, the rial, fluctuates significantly and has two exchange rates to the U.S. dollar — the official, approved by the Central Bank of Iran, and the market rate — which is inconvenient in terms of calculations for Russian exports.</p>
<p>News that Tehran and Moscow are discussing the possible launch of a digital currency backed by gold came out earlier in January when the head of the Russian crypto industry association <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/iran-and-russia-consider-issuing-gold-backed-stablecoin-officials-unveil/">told</a> the business daily Vedomosti that Iran’s central bank is mulling over developing one with Russian participation. The token would be used to facilitate trade in the Persian region, the executive revealed.</p>
<h2>Gold-Backed Russian Digital Currency First Proposed in 2019</h2>
<p>The idea to issue a Russian gold-backed stablecoin was initially circulated in May 2019, during a meeting at the State Duma joined by the governor of the Bank of Russia, Elvira Nabiullina. At the time, the member of the house Vladimir Gutenev suggested that the central bank should initiate talks on the matter with the other <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sberbank-analysts-editorial-tremendous-potential-brics-reserve-currency-fueling-de-dollarization/">BRICS</a> countries and insisted:</p>
<blockquote><p>Gold is the least vulnerable asset. We could probably find understanding in China, India, and Brazil.</p></blockquote>
<p>“But these are rather not cryptocurrencies, maybe so-called stablecoins,” remarked Anatoly Aksakov, while Nabiullina indicated that the monetary authority is open to a stablecoin backed by a real asset. A proposal for a ‘<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russia-may-allow-crypto-mining-and-gold-backed-stablecoins-lawmaker-says/">golden ruble</a>’ stablecoin was also featured in a report by the VEB.RF Institute for Research and Expertise released in the summer of 2022.</p>
<p>Pressed by Western sanctions, Russia and Iran have been also exploring options to use decentralized cryptocurrencies to circumvent restrictions in foreign trade. In August, last year, Iran placed its first official import <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/iran-places-first-official-import-order-with-cryptocurrency-worth-10-million/">order using crypto</a> while Russia is taking <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bank-of-russia-to-test-international-crypto-payments-with-companies/">steps to legalize</a> cross-border crypto payments. A <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bank-of-russia-outlines-payment-models-with-digital-ruble-other-cbdcs/">digital ruble</a> and a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/iran-begins-central-bank-digital-currency-crypto-rial-pilot-today/">crypto rial</a> that are not backed by gold are also under development.</p>

The company announced that 52 games of the league will be available to be enjoyed using VR (virtual reality) tech, using Xtadium, a co-viewing platform. Five of these games will be presented in a more immersive way for Horizon Worlds, Meta&#8217;s flagship metaverse app.</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">NBA to Broadcast 52 Games in the Metaverse</h2>
<p>The NBA has sealed a deal to bring some of its games freely to the metaverse. On Jan. 23, the company <a href="https://www.oculus.com/blog/nba-basketball-2023-season-xtadium-meta-horizon-worlds-vr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> an extension of its current partnership with Meta to broadcast its games using VR (virtual reality) technology. The games will be broadcasted using Xtadium, a metaverse app that is used to broadcast immersive sports experiences using Meta&#8217;s consumer headset, the Meta Quest 2.</p>
<p>The league will present 52 games in Horizon Worlds, Meta&#8217;s flagship metaverse app, for users to enjoy and watch. Five of these games will be presented in a more immersive way, using 180-degree monoscopic tech. This means that the user will be able to experience the game as if they were sitting close to the court, changing the point of view as the match advances.</p>
<p>With this move, the league aims for existing fans to have a more interactive experience, and bring new fans that are familiarized with these new technologies to the sport. About this, Meta director of metaverse media content Sarah Malkin stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>VR’s superpower is making it possible to immerse yourself in shared experiences with friends and fans from around the world, and we’re thrilled to bring these killer features to the NBA Arena and live games.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Avatar Merchandise and More</h2>
<p>The NBA and Meta will also offer the opportunity for fans to purchase NBA-licensed apparel in Meta&#8217;s Avatars Store. These elements will be available across the family of Meta&#8217;s owned apps, including Whatsapp, Instagram, and Facebook. Meta director of sports media and league partnerships Rob Shaw reinforced the significance of bringing new technologies to fans. He explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Meta’s immersive VR technology is opening up new opportunities for sports fans to engage and interact with their favorite NBA teams. Fans will be able to express their fandom by donning their favorite team’s gear on Avatars and enjoy more live NBA games.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The NBA has been very receptive to using new technologies to expand the reach of its activities. In partnership with Dapper Labs, the company <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nba-nbpa-and-dapper-labs-bring-first-of-its-kind-blockchain-game-to-basketball-fans-around-the-globe-300894029.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> NBA Top Shots back in 2020, an NFT video marketplace featuring moments, which are some of the most important plays in the story of the league. In September, the league <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sorare-partners-with-nba-to-build-a-licensed-nft-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partnered</a> with Sorare, a fantasy game company, in order to create an NFT (non-fungible token) game.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin&#x2019;s Rainbow Chart Is Making the Rounds Again</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Last year, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/rainbows-log-charts-and-s2f-bitcoins-2022-bear-market-has-broken-the-communitys-most-popular-price-models/">specifically</a> in Aug. 2022 and then at the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-supporters-sift-through-the-graveyard-of-technical-indicators-that-failed-to-predict-bitcoins-bottom/">end of the year</a>, the cryptocurrency community <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zwfq0p/is_the_bear_market_bottom_in_information_from/">discussed</a> the various charts and price models people used to predict where bitcoin&#x2019;s price was headed next. Over the last decade, a number of the models have followed bitcoin&#x2019;s specific price patterns pretty closely. People would often leverage charts and models like the rainbow indicator, the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/spiral-out-using-the-golden-ratio-and-fibonacci-sequence-to-predict-bitcoin-price-cycles/">golden ratio multiplier</a>, the Fibonacci sequence, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/visualizing-bitcoins-future-price-cycles-with-the-power-law-corridor-model/">logarithmic growth curves</a>, and Plan B&#x2019;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/stock-to-flow-bitcoin-price-model-criticized-as-btc-price-ratio-matches-2019-statistics/">stock-to-flow</a> (S2F) price model.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As the community felt the grip of the crypto winter and the price models failed to forecast bitcoin&#x2019;s price bottom, people started to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/plan-bs-stock-to-flow-price-model-denounced-by-vitalik-buterin-says-model-can-be-harmful/">dismiss the bitcoin price models</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsdennis/status/1538398855040929797?s=20&t=y31HotKwWbXW-o8l0tyCcg">mock indicators</a> like the rainbow chart. But this week, people have <a href="https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1618540285092581378?s=20&t=ADOsPEGQkcnnw77k5YWIAw">noticed</a> that bitcoin&#x2019;s price on the rainbow model has entered the lowest and darkest band. The rainbow chart is located on a number of bitcoin-focused websites that showcase charts and data, including <a href="https://www.blockchaincenter.net/static/rainbow-chart.html">blockchaincenter.net</a> and <a href="https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/bitcoin-rainbow-chart/">lookintobitcoin.com</a>.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-570948 size-full" title="After Mocking the Price Model, Crypto Advocates Discuss Bitcoin's Rainbow Chart Reintegration" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ranbow.jpg" alt="After Mocking the Price Model, Crypto Advocates Discuss Bitcoin's Rainbow Chart Reintegration" width="1280" height="800" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ranbow-300x188.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ranbow-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ranbow-768x480.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ranbow.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px">&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The blockchaincenter.net chart shows that bitcoin&#x2019;s price has not broken the darkest and lowest band in the rainbow, but the lookintobitcoin.com chart shows a break. Lookintobitcoin.com summarizes how the rainbow chart, or colored bands, are overlaid over <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s logarithmic growth curve channel. It can signal when to buy and when to sell, but the website stresses &#x201C;there is no guarantee that past performance fit within the rainbow channel will continue to play out in the future.&#x201D;&#13;<br />

While the indicator shows <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s price has been on the rise, a correction could very well be in the cards. Furthermore, while the rainbow chart is in good standing, the <a href="https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/bitcoin-logarithmic-growth-curve/">logarithmic growth curve chart</a> is way off the map, by a long shot.&#13;<br />

According to statistics from Dune Analytics, Blur has captured about 30% of the market share in terms of sales volume. The NFT marketplace leader, Opensea, commands 48% of the market share.</strong></p>
<h2>Blur NFT Marketplace Captures 30% of Market Share in Sales Volume</h2>
<p>An NFT marketplace called <a href="https://blur.io/">Blur</a> has seen an increase in market share over the past 30 days. According to <a href="https://dune.com/hildobby/NFTs">statistics</a> from Dune Analytics, Blur holds 30% of the NFT market&#8217;s total market share. Crypto market participants believe Blur&#8217;s rise is associated with the upcoming launch of its native token, originally scheduled for January 2023 but delayed, according to a statement from the team. The token is now set to be released on Feb. 14, 2023.</p>
<p>“We know this is past our initial estimate of January and we’re sorry for the delay,” the platform <a href="https://twitter.com/blur_io/status/1616125798951571456">tweeted on Thursday</a>. “We’re trying new things and the extra two weeks will allow us to deliver a launch that hasn’t been done before.”</p>
<p>Seven-day <a href="https://dappradar.com/nft/marketplaces">metrics</a> from dappradar.com indicate that Blur has recorded $33.06 million in NFT sales. The marketplace is the second-largest in terms of total sales this week, behind <a href="https://opensea.io/">Opensea</a>&#8216;s weekly sales of $112.89 million. Twenty-four-hour statistics indicate that Blur&#8217;s sales over the last day totaled $5.08 million, compared to Opensea&#8217;s $16.24 million. Blur&#8217;s rise is similar to that of the Looksrare NFT marketplace, which saw an increase in users when it <a href="https://docs.looksrare.org/guides/faqs/what-is-the-looks-airdrop">decided to airdrop</a> 120 million LOOKS tokens, or 12% of the total supply, to the Looksrare community in 2021.</p>
<p>The incentive to acquire airdropped tokens fueled Looksrare&#8217;s sales volumes, and during the fourth quarter of 2021, the NFT platform managed to capture significant volumes alongside Opensea. In January 2022, Looksrare <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/nft-market-looksrare-surpasses-openseas-24-hour-sales-with-385-million-in-volume/">surpassed</a> Opensea&#8217;s daily volumes for a short period. Since then, Looksrare dropped from the second-leading NFT marketplace in sales down to the fifth position today. In terms of all-time sales, Blur has captured $458.05 million in sales since its inception.</p>
<p>The NFT marketplace Blur is ranked 11th in terms of all-time sales. It is below NFT markets such as Magic Eden&#8217;s $2.07 billion, Looksrare&#8217;s $1.69 billion, and X2Y2&#8217;s $1.07 billion. However, it has surpassed the all-time sales recorded by the NFT markets Wax Atomicmarket ($441.42 million), Immutable X Marketplace ($387.11 million), and Rarible ($301.95 million).</p>

Industries, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), video rendering, powering blockchain computations, scientific simulations and research, financial modeling and analysis, weather analysis, medical imaging and healthcare and autonomous vehicles are all increasing their demands to collect, store, analyze, manipulate and extract data, delivering real-time results. </span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a need to make sense of the vast amounts of data being generated through the increasing use of data-driven technologies and services. The higher the performance of a device combined with the greater the number of devices undertaking the task, the quicker the result or outcome is provided. As real-time systems demand immediate results, the performance of data processing becomes critical to the delivery of the service. </span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Centralized data centers have previously been supported by many countries, including Iceland and China, to provide data processing services. However, as demand for data processing grows, centralized data processing centers are having difficulty coping with the demand. Centralized operations consume significant amounts of energy both in terms of service delivery (data processing) and service support (e.g., air conditioning to cool the infrastructure). Energy distribution infrastructure is not supportive of increasing localized demand, impacting commercial and residential supply. In addition, centralized service centers are having difficulty with physical expansion, both in terms of available land and space and impact on energy distribution infrastructure. </span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With the global increase in energy prices combined with the problems associated with centralized data centers taking energy from the local distribution ecosystem and the need for growth to support the increasing demand for data processing power, organizations are looking for alternative approaches to delivering data processing services. </span>&#13;<br />

&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Global, decentralized data processing is the way forward. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating a decentralized, global data processing network, interconnected through cloud technology is one approach to solving the centralized data processing problem. </span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Firstly, the cloud offers scalability and flexibility. Cloud-based data processing allows businesses to scale their processing power up or down as needed, without the need to invest in expensive hardware. This means businesses can pay only for the processing power they need, when they need it.</span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Secondly, the cloud offers cost-effectiveness. Cloud-based data processing eliminates the need for businesses to invest in expensive hardware and software or pay for the maintenance and upkeep of on-premises data centers. This can result in significant cost savings for businesses.</span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thirdly, the cloud offers accessibility and mobility. Cloud-based data processing can be accessed from anywhere, at any time, as long as there is an internet connection. This means businesses can access their data and processing power from any location, making it ideal for remote working and global operations.</span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Fourthly, the future of data processing lies in the cloud because of the nature of the technology. </span>&#13;<br />

&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">GAIMIN.CLOUD harnesses the underutilized processing power found in high performance PC-based Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) into one network, delivering supercomputer-level performance, facilitating the delivery of large-scale data processing requirements whilst spreading the consumption of processing energy, globally. </span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">GAIMIN identified gaming PCs as the most appropriate device to target to create GAIMIN.CLOUD. A gaming PC typically includes a high-performance Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). </span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">From research, the GPU is typically underutilized within a gaming PC. The gaming PC is typically only used for around 20% of the day for gaming but remains switched on when not being used. The gamer continually looks to improve their gaming experience and continually upgrades their PC resulting in even greater performance available from the devices.</span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">GAIMIN&#x2019;s approach creates a greener, more ecologically compliant approach to energy consumption for data processing services, spreading processing capability through different countries and regions, mitigating energy consumption bottlenecks, and resolves supply problems through the ability to re-route network processing. </span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">GAIMIN calls this network GAIMIN.CLOUD</span>&#13;<br />

&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">GAIMIN.CLOUD uses gamers as the service providers via the contribution of their computational resources. </span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This means that gamers can monetize their idle computing power and earn money while they play their favorite games or by doing nothing other than leaving their computer running with the application downloaded from </span><a href="https://www.gaimin.gg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GAIMIN.gg</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With GAIMIN, gamers can make a real difference in the world by contributing to the data processing needs of businesses and organizations.</span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most exciting aspects of GAIMIN.CLOUD is that it offers real social impact by giving back up to 90% of the revenue to gamers. This means that users of the platform can help create genuine social impact and improve the lives of potentially 1.5 billion gamers. Gamers can earn extra income and improve their financial situation while they play, without having to take on extra work or sacrificing their leisure time.</span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to improving the lives of gamers, GAIMIN.CLOUD also helps to bridge the digital divide by providing access to powerful data processing capabilities to individuals and organizations that may not have been able to afford it before. This can help to promote innovation, economic growth, and social progress in communities around the world.</span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">GAIMIN.CLOUD is not just a powerful data processing platform; it is also a powerful social and economic engine that can help to create a better future for everyone. By harnessing the power of the global gaming community, GAIMIN.CLOUD is helping to build a more equitable, sustainable, and inclusive world for all.</span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">GAIMIN monetizes through GAIMIN.CLOUD with the provision of different data processing services. Currently focusing on video rendering and powering of blockchain computations, GAIMIN.CLOUD will soon be extending its service provision into other data processing services, including AI data processing and other big-data processing requirements. </span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<strong>Using AI to Maximise Rewards</strong>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">GAIMIN&#x2019;s AI driven approach develops sub-processing networks within GAIMIN.CLOUD, capable of delivering different data processing services. </span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The decision-making AI engine identifies the devices currently available to GAIMIN and builds processing networks based on devices, performance and data processing job requirements. Some devices are more appropriate for specific data processing services and so, depending on job requirements, GAIMIN will build a sub network comprising appropriate processing devices and submit jobs accordingly. </span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The GAIMIN AI Engine identifies the most profitable jobs first and allocates devices where the most profit is available. There is always the backstop solution &#x2013; powering blockchain computations. When there is no other job available, the AI Engine diverts available resources into the powering of blockchain computations ensuring GAIMIN.CLOUD is always delivering some form of monetization and reward generation. </span>&#13;<br />

&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">GAIMIN pays its users in GMRX, GAIMIN&#x2019;s own cryptocurrency.</span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When a user monetizes their device, GAIMIN receives payment for the delivery of services in a number of different ways &#x2013; fiat and crypto for example. GAIMIN returns upto 90% of the rewards generated back to the user in the consolidated GMRX crypto currency. </span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A user stores their GMRX, which can be used for the purchase of accessories, merchandise, in-game assets and NFTs. As GMRX is soon to be listed on crypto exchanges, a user can convert their GMRX into other crypto assets or fiat currency.</span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As you would expect, GAIMIN wants its users to retain their GMRX and use it for purchases through GAIMIN. GAIMIN incentivises GMRX holders to retain their GMRX through additional benefits, bonuses and discounts, including NFTs, bespoke merchandise, discounted accessories. </span>&#13;<br />

&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As an example, a user with a mid-range GPU could expect to earn $1 per day when active in the GAIMIN network. GAIMIN intends to create in-game NFTs for $1 or less, enabling a gamer to build their own repository of in-game interoperable NFTs to support their gameplay. Being interoperable, the NFTs can be re-used across different games and genres and take a form and operational structure relevant to the game. </span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Medium and higher cost NFTs, which have enhanced utility and attributes, will be minted but require the user to remain participating in the GAIMIN network until they have earned sufficient rewards to acquire a more expensive asset. </span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<b>No Gamer Left Behind</b>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">GAIMIN&#x2019;s monetization approach is multi-functional and not based on one aspect. </span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a href="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/picture1-2.png?X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAYIWLWC3GPQWL5SMB%2F20230126%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230126T161438Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=600&X-Amz-Signature=0cf1ba8af029dc6ce34a0655d5f044f9bcb3eddce1aefadccc323289f9d9cba7"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium_large wp-image-570906 alignnone" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/picture1-2-768x459.png" alt="" width="768" height="459" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/picture1-2-300x179.png 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/picture1-2-768x459.png 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/picture1-2.png 975w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></a>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">GAIMIN has created a number of user-retention mechanisms. Traditional monetization options typically focus on one approach &#x2013; for example, mining alone or rendering alone, where the value of user rewards is dependent on the performance contributed by the user. The greater the performance of a device, the greater the contribution, the greater the reward. This discriminates against users who do not have high performance devices! </span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">GAIMIN&#x2019;s multi-functional approach implements a variety of mechanisms to reward users for participating in the GAIMIN network. This includes rewards based on hashpower however to ensure no gamer is left behind, GAIMIN has introduced other approaches to reward a user &#x2013; for example, time (hours) connected to the GAIMIN network &#x2013; the longer a device remains active on the network, the more hours the user builds to allow them to claim different NFT assets and rewards. This approach is unique to GAIMIN and sets GAIMIN apart from the perceived competition whose focus and reward is purely based on hashpower. </span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />

The comprehensive list, which is over 100 pages long, shows that FTX owes a lot of money to well-known institutions, including Binance, Airbnb, Apple, Amazon, Linkedin, Coindesk, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), and more. U.S. government entities, such as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Treasury&#8217;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), are also included.</strong></p>
<h2>FTX Creditor List Reveals Wide Range of Businesses Owed Money</h2>
<p>On Jan. 24, 2023, FTX <a href="https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/FTX">published</a> the bankrupt firm&#8217;s creditor ledger, which contains more than 100 pages of names. The creditors&#8217; list includes government agencies from Switzerland, Hong Kong, the U.S., and Japan. In addition, the ledger features a myriad of well-known businesses, including Alibaba, Allied Sports, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Twitter, Google, Blue Bottle Coffee, Bonham Capital, Bitstamp, Bitgo, Infura, Inca Digital, Lightspeed Strategic Partners, Long Watch Security, Mercedes-Benz, Messari, Nomura, and O&#8217;Leary Productions. Bankruptcy documents filed last year indicate that the top 50 FTX creditors are owed an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/collapsed-ftx-owes-nearly-31-bln-top-50-creditors-2022-11-20/">estimated $3 billion</a>.</p>
<p>The FTX creditors&#8217; list includes U.S. government agencies, such as the IRS, FinCEN, and various state tax collectors from a number of different states. The list showcases three major airlines, hotels, apartments, nonprofits, and software companies that provide cloud services. However, around 9.69 million FTX customer names are redacted from the creditor ledger. The list also highlights a great deal of businesses stemming from The Bahamas, where the FTX inner circle operated. Creditors further include banks, Stanford University, Fox News, Coindesk, and the Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>The court filing shows monies owed to a large number of creditors, but it does not mean the entity or individual leveraged the FTX exchange to trade crypto. For instance, a spokesperson from the Swiss regulatory entity FINMA <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-treasury-financial-watchdogs-companies-among-ftx-creditors-filing-shows-2023-01-26/">told</a> Reuters that it did not understand why it was on the list. FINMA &#8220;was not a client of FTX and had not acted on its platforms,&#8221; the spokesperson told the news outlet. Reuters reporter Noele Illien also reached out to Airbnb for comment, but the company did not respond.</p>

The token rose by as much as 5% earlier in the day, climbing to its strongest point since November. Monero was also in the green, nearing a key resistance level in the process. </strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>)</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>) rebounded on Thursday, with prices moving to an eleven-week high in the process.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Following a low of $0.3537 on Wednesday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>/USD rose to an intraday high of $0.3866 earlier today.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As a result of this, cardano rose to its strongest point since November 8, which is the last time prices were above $0.4100.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Looking at the chart, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a> has moved lower from earlier gains, as traders appear to have taken profits near a ceiling of $0.3875.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As of writing, the token is trading at $0.3774, with the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) near a resistance of its own at 74.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The index, which is currently tracking at 69.22, will likely need to move past the 74.00 point in order for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a> jump over the $0.3875 hurdle.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>Monero (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" target="_blank">XMR</a>)</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
In addition to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>, monero (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" target="_blank">XMR</a>) also surged earlier in the day, as it edged closer to a key resistance level.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" target="_blank">XMR</a>/USD moved to a peak of $178.15 earlier in the day, which comes less than a day after falling to a low of $169.84.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Today&#x2019;s surge sent monero closer to its long-term resistance level at $180.00, which was last broken on Sunday.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As can be seen from the chart, the relative strength index (RSI) is currently hovering below a ceiling of its own at 65.00, with a current reading of 63.25.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In order for bulls to take <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" target="_blank">XMR</a> back above the $180.00 level, price strength will first need to surpass the 65.00 mark.&#13;<br />

The electric car company&#x2019;s digital assets comprise mostly bitcoin. The reduced value of its crypto holdings is due to fluctuations in the price of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, which led to an impairment charge of $34 million. At the time of writing, bitcoin is trading at $23,087; it fell from about $47.8K to around $16.6K during 2022.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Tesla has not revealed how many bitcoin it owns but an industry <a href="https://bitcointreasuries.net/entities/2">estimate</a> suggests that it is hodling about 9,720 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. Besides bitcoin, Tesla also holds a small amount of dogecoin (DOGE) which it acquired from selling some merchandise for the meme cryptocurrency. The company began <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/tesla-begins-accepting-dogecoin-payments-merchandise-purchased-with-doge/">accepting</a> payments in dogecoin for some merchandise in January last year.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Tesla bought $1.5 billion worth of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> in early 2021 and has not purchased any more since. However, the company dumped about 75% of its <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> holdings in the second quarter of last year. CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/tesla-sold-75-of-its-bitcoin-elon-musk-says-we-have-not-sold-any-of-our-dogecoin/">explained</a> at a time that Tesla sold its <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> in order to maximize its cash position due to the uncertainty as to &#x201C;when the Covid lockdowns in China would alleviate.&#x201D; He emphasized: &#x201C;We are certainly open to increasing our bitcoin holdings in [the] future, so this should not be taken as some verdict on bitcoin.&#x201D; He also mentioned that the company did not sell any DOGE.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Musk himself <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/elon-musk-spacex-owns-bitcoin-personally-owns-btc-ethereum-dogecoin-pump-dont-dump/">personally owns</a> bitcoin, ether, and dogecoin. He tweeted in March last year that he still owns and will not sell any of the three cryptocurrencies. &#x201C;I still own & won&#x2019;t sell my bitcoin, ethereum or doge,&#x201D; the billionaire wrote.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In Tesla&#x2019;s earnings call with analysts Wednesday afternoon, Musk reiterated: &#x201C;There&#x2019;s going to be bumps along the way and we&#x2019;ll probably have a pretty difficult recession this year, probably. I hope not, but probably.&#x201D; While cautioning that &#x201C;one can&#x2019;t predict the short-term stock value,&#x201D; the Tesla boss stressed:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>But long term, I&#x2019;m convinced that, Tesla will be the most valuable company on Earth.</p></blockquote>

However, Harry Dent, founder of HS Dent Investment Management, believes that this trend may not continue in the near future. Dent predicts that gold may lose value to the range of $900 to $1,000 over the next 18 months.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>HS Dent Founder&#x2019;s &#x2018;Everything Bubble&#x2019; Theory and Its Potential Impact on the Economy</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
On Tuesday, Harry Dent, founder of HS Dent and financial author, <a href="https://youtu.be/Lt2acCWr9QE">spoke</a> with Michelle Makori, the lead anchor and editor-in-chief at Kitco News. Dent expressed his belief that &#x201C;the biggest crash in our lifetime&#x201D; is approaching and that gold will be one of the year&#x2019;s hardest-hit commodities. This perspective differs from that of many &#x201C;gold bugs&#x201D; who <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/gold-prices-expected-to-soar-in-2023-experts-predict-record-highs-for-precious-metal/">believe</a> 2023 will be a positive year for the yellow metal.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
This week, economist and gold advocate Peter Schiff <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-explains-why-bitcoin-and-gold-are-up-this-year-theyre-rising-for-opposite-reasons/">stated</a> that gold&#x2019;s rise in value is due to its perception as &#x201C;a hedge against inflation and a weaker dollar.&#x201D; Historically, gold has been viewed as a reliable store of value and a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. Similarly, Jim Cramer, host of CNBC&#x2019;s Mad Money program, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jim-cramer-says-avoid-crypto-stick-with-gold-for-real-hedge-against-inflation-and-economic-chaos/">emphasized</a> that those who truly wish to protect against &#x201C;inflation or economic chaos,&#x201D; should &#x201C;stick with gold.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Dent strongly disagrees with these perspectives and predicts that gold will lose significant value over the next 18 months. &#x201C;Gold is not a safe haven,&#x201D; Dent stated during his interview with Makori. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m predicting that gold goes down to $900 to $1,000. That will be a lot less than other commodities &#x2026; that is still a 40 to 45 percent fall from here,&#x201D; he added. Dent has previously identified several manufactured financial bubbles over the years and referred to the current situation as the &#x201C;everything bubble.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
While Dent believes 2023 may be challenging, he anticipates that mid-2024 will be even worse. &#x201C;I feel like the ultimate low at this point for stocks is likely to be &#x2026; July or so of 2024,&#x201D; Dent said during the interview, noting that the tech-heavy Nasdaq index (IXIC) could reach 10,088 again. &#x201C;So, we&#x2019;re still in the early stages. To know that this crash is continuing and will go a lot deeper, we need to break the last low &#x2026; which is 10,088.&#x201D; The financial author added:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>The boom from 2009 to late 2021 in stocks was 120 percent artificial. It was just [the U.S. central bank] stimulating more and more to keep the stock market going up &#x2026; That is taking a toxic financial drug, which when it finally goes down and fails, you have a hangup.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#13;</p>
<h2>Dent Predicts Bitcoin Will Be Hardest-Hit Asset in Upcoming Economic Crash, But Is Still Bullish Long-Term</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Dent presumes that we are beginning the next wave of decline after a period of lateral movement. &#x201C;This bubble has finally burst, it has started to burst,&#x201D; Dent asserted to the Kitco anchor. &#x201C;Now a bubble of this magnitude, like 1929 or 1972, which was not a bubble but it was a long-term [downturn]. It takes two-and-a-half to three years for a whole crash to happen. All we&#x2019;ve seen so far, and we have seen it, is the first crash,&#x201D; Dent added. In terms of <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a>, Dent believes it will be the hardest hit among all assets and stocks.&#13;</p>
<p class="p1">
<p>&#13;<br />
The HS Dent executive expects bitcoin to crash to the $3,250 range, reaching the same low as it did during the Covid-19 crash in March 2020. &#x201C;I think it goes down to $3,250, and then it starts a longer-term boom,&#x201D; Dent opined. The investor views cryptocurrency as the next big thing and believes it has the potential to lead to the digitization of all aspects of finance and money. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s $600 trillion dollars&#x201D; in financial assets, Dent detailed, and digitizing that and expanding trade to make it more efficient is a &#x201C;huge thing.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The true purpose of cryptocurrency, according to Dent, is to restructure the entire financial assets market, which is the largest financial number in the world. Global GDP is roughly $100 trillion Dent explained, while financial assets &#x201C;is the largest multiplier,&#x201D; around $600 trillion. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m bullish on bitcoin and crypto,&#x201D; Dent said.&#13;<br />
