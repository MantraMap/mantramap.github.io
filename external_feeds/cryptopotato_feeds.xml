            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum&#8217;s price rally has slowed down in recent weeks. The price has yet to break above the $2,000 level, which is making many market participants worried.</p>
<h2><strong>Ethereum Price Technical Analysis</strong></h2>
<p><strong>By: <a href="https://twitter.com/TradingRage" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Edris</a></strong></p>
<h3>The Daily Chart:</h3>
<p>On the daily timeframe, the price has been forming higher highs and higher lows since rebounding from the 200-day moving average earlier in June.</p>
<p>However, there is a clear lack of bullish momentum, as the ETH price keeps pulling back towards the 50-day moving average located around the $1,900 mark. In case it breaks, there are two close support levels available: the $1,800 static level and the 200-day moving average close to the same price mark.</p>
<p>Therefore, while the momentum is seemingly fading, there is still hope that a rebound from either of these levels would initiate the next rally higher.</p>

<h3>The 4-Hour Chart:</h3>
<p>Recent PA developments become clearer on the 4-hour chart.</p>
<p>The ETH price has broken above the $1,930 resistance level a couple of times since the beginning of July but has failed in both instances, as it has rapidly dropped back below the level.</p>
<p>Currently, the price is seemingly targeting the $1,850 short-term support level once again, with the $1,750 level available as the next target in line in case the former level fails to hold. The RSI indicator, while previously signaling the potential fake breakout and drop, is offering little insight at the moment, as it is oscillating around the 50% value. This behavior confirms the indecisiveness of the market participants and the equilibrium in momentum.</p>
<figure id="attachment_261194" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-261194" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSDT-4H-Jul-18-2023-scaled.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-261194 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSDT-4H-Jul-18-2023-scaled.jpg" alt="eth_price_chart_1807232" width="2560" height="1464" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSDT-4H-Jul-18-2023-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSDT-4H-Jul-18-2023-300x172.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSDT-4H-Jul-18-2023-1024x586.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSDT-4H-Jul-18-2023-768x439.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSDT-4H-Jul-18-2023-1536x879.jpg 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSDT-4H-Jul-18-2023-2048x1171.jpg 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSDT-4H-Jul-18-2023-50x29.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-261194" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Sentiment Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>By: <a href="https://twitter.com/TradingRage" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Edris</a></strong></p>
<h3>Ethereum Coinbase Premium Index</h3>
<p>Ethereum&#8217;s price has remained relatively stagnant over the past few months, consolidating around the $2,000 level. However, interesting activity has been going on in the background.</p>
<p>The chart displays the Ethereum Coinbase premium gap, which is calculated based on the gap between ETH&#8217;s price on Coinbase and Binance, two of the largest exchanges in the world. This metric shows whether US investors are buying or selling on aggregate compared to other investors. Positive values indicate buying pressure from the United States.</p>
<p>As the image demonstrates, there has been a significant shift in the US market sentiment, as the premium gap index has mostly been positive. Considering that many US investors are wealthy individuals or institutions, this could be a positive signal for ETH, pointing out that it might be in the accumulation phase at the beginning of a new bull market.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ripple&#8217;s price has experienced a significant surge after finding strong support around the 100-day moving average at $0.497. It is now approaching a crucial resistance level at $0.85, indicating a prevailing buying pressure in the market and a positive outlook for Ripple&#8217;s medium-term prospects.</p>
<h2><strong>Ripple Price Technical Analysis</strong></h2>
<p><strong>By <a href="http://twitter.com/greatest_trader" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Shayan</a></strong></p>
<h3>The Daily Chart</h3>
<p>Analyzing the daily chart, it is apparent that the XRP price increased after finding support at the 100-day moving average. However, it now faces a strong resistance zone at $0.85, characterized by high selling pressure and increased supply.</p>
<p>This development suggests a bullish sentiment among traders, increasing the likelihood of a breakthrough above the resistance region. However, it&#8217;s important to note that every significant upward movement is typically followed by a consolidation or correction phase, and Ripple&#8217;s price is no exception.</p>
<p>Therefore, it seems likely that the price will enter a short-term correction phase, accompanied by higher volatility and pullback periods before the next significant upward movement occurs.</p>

<h3><strong>The 4-Hour Chart</strong></h3>
<p>On the 4-hour chart, it can be seen that the price has successfully broken above the upper edge of a channel, evidenced by a large green candle resulting from a recent explosive rally. However, for a valid breakout confirmation, a pullback to the broken level should occur.</p>
<p>Therefore, based on the price action, it appears more likely that the price will retrace back to the upper boundary and complete a pullback. If this occurs, the market can expect the bullish rally to continue, reaching higher resistance levels.</p>
<p>However, in the event that the recent breakout proves to be false, Ripple may face significant rejection and a subsequent decline.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PRESS RELEASE &#8211; Paris, France, July 18th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Sushi to deploy Interchain Tokens, powered by new Axelar product suite delivering cross-chain fungibility and customization. </strong></em></p>
<p class="ql-align-justify"><a href="https://axelar.network/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Axelar</a>, the blockchain interoperability leader, is announcing the launch of <a href="https://axelar.network/its" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Interchain Token Service (ITS)</a>, a product suite that extends tokens cross-chain, preserving their native functionality and allowing teams to easily manage supply and features.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">ERC-20 tokens have unlocked powerful interoperability between Ethereum-based applications. In a similar way, Interchain Token Service creates Interchain Tokens that unlock new possibilities for interconnected applications spanning all EVM-compatible ecosystems. Sushi, the popular decentralized exchange (DEX) &amp; automated market maker (AMM), is among the first deployment partners to embrace Interchain Tokens.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">Interchain Token Service delivers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fungibility: Wrapped versions on connected chains are fungible with one another.</li>
<li>Custom functionality: Custom tokens keep their features, cross-chain.</li>
<li>Low overhead: Smart contracts and developer tools automate complex developer tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ql-align-justify">Sushi will employ Interchain Token Service to give SUSHI, its native token, seamless interoperability across multiple chains. To start, Interchain SUSHI tokens will be interoperable across Arbitrum, Ethereum, Optimism and Polygon. Sushi will manage its multichain deployments with minimal overhead, deploying and updating Interchain Tokens with a single click.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">Traditionally, in order for Web3 applications to reach multiple blockchain ecosystems, they would rely on <a href="https://axelar.network/blog/cross-chain-bridges-benefits-limitations-risks" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">bridged versions</a> of their tokens: risky, limited in function and nonfungible with each other. <a href="https://axelar.network/blog/blockchain-interoperability-how-to-achieve-it-securely" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Alternatively</a>, they may deploy copies of the native token on multiple chains, incurring significant developer overhead. Using the Axelar network&#8217;s full-stack interoperability, Interchain Token Service delivers smart contracts and developer tools that automate away this overhead: developers can manage Interchain Tokens with the click of a button.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Axelar&#8217;s Interchain Token Service unlocks a more seamless, interchain experience for Sushi users,&#8221; said Sushi&#8217;s head chef, Jared Grey. &#8220;Currently, there are many bridged versions of $SUSHI – lacking fungibility, carrying bridge risk. With Interchain Tokens, Sushi can achieve true cross-chain interoperability, simply and securely.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Sergey Gorbunov, co-founder of Axelar, highlighted the significance of Interchain Tokens. &#8220;With Interchain Token Service, we are empowering developers to unlock the full potential of their tokens and extend their reach across multiple chains,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This new extension of Axelar&#8217;s secure and programmable interoperability layer will be the catalyst to a more connected and inclusive blockchain economy.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

			            <description><![CDATA[Ripple may have won the battle but the war rages on. Will the SEC let go?]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The legal clash between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission has turned into a cornerstone case for the entire cryptocurrency industry. According to many, it may have serious implications for future lawsuits, regardless of how it ends.</p>
<p>Most recently, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that secondary sales of XRP didn&#8217;t constitute investment contracts &#8211; a move that the market perceived as a major win for Ripple. But is there more to the story? Did Brad Garlinghouse and Co. win?</p>
<p>To answer that, we first need to understand what exactly happened so far.</p>
<h2>Massive Victory but Partial Nonetheless</h2>
<p>The crux of the SEC&#8217;s charges is that Ripple &#8211; the company behind XRP &#8211; conducted an unregistered sale of securities in violation of existing regulations.</p>
<p>However, the Commission also alleged that secondary sales of XRP (read: sold on centralized exchanges like Coinbase) also constituted investment contracts. To this, it&#8217;s important to take a closer look at the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.551082/gov.uscourts.nysd.551082.874.0.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">recent ruling</a> itself.</p>
<p>Immediately as the news broke out, XRP <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-price-explodes-16-as-judge-rules-in-favor-of-ripple-in-sec-case/" data-wpel-link="internal">exploded</a> by more than 70% in hours before settling down and trading at its current prices. Therefore, it&#8217;s safe to assume that the market perceived the ruling as favorable for Ripple &#8211; and it was, to a certain extent.</p>
<p>More precisely, Judge Torres ruled that secondary sales of XRP didn&#8217;t constitute investment contracts. See, because of the SEC allegations, a myriad of exchanges had previously delisted XRP in fear of repercussions. These included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coinbase</li>
<li>Bitwise</li>
<li>CrossTower</li>
<li>OSL</li>
<li>Bitstamp</li>
<li>Crypto.com, and many more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that the ruling is out, some of the above, such as Coinbase, Crypto.com, Kraken, and Bitstamp, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/these-crypto-exchanges-re-listed-xrp-following-ripples-victory-against-the-sec/" data-wpel-link="internal">re-listed XRP</a>.</p>
<p>So, why a partial victory?</p>
<p>Well, as we mentioned above, the allegations are two-fold, and Judge Torres confirmed the position of the SEC in regard to institutional sales.</p>
<p>More specifically, the Judge said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;Therefore, having considered the economic reality and totality of circumstances surrounding the <strong>Institutional Sales, </strong>the Court concludes that <strong>Ripple&#8217;s Institutional Sales of XRP </strong><em>constituted the unregistered offered and sale of investment contracts in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act.</em></p></blockquote>
<h2>So, What&#8217;s Next?</h2>
<p>Based on the above, it seems relatively straightforward to assume that the legal battle is far from being over.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/stuttering-sec-chair-gary-gensler-disappointed-at-ripple-victory/" data-wpel-link="internal">Commenting</a> on the ruling was the Chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, who didn&#8217;t hide his disappointment:</p>
<blockquote><p>While disappointed on what they said about retail investors, we&#8217;re still looking at it and assessing that opinion.</p></blockquote>
<p>His speech itself was stuttered, and it appeared at times that Gensler was at a loss for word on stage at the National Press Club on July 17th.</p>
<p>That said, it&#8217;s also clear that the SEC is likely not going to let this go. However, the fact that XRP got re-listed on multiple exchanges because of the most recent ruling is a huge victory for Ripple. More importantly, the ball is in the SEC&#8217;s court now and it&#8217;s interesting to see if they will file an appeal.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Coinbase is expected to release its Q2 earnings early next month.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Investors are closely monitoring Coinbase&#8217;s earning reports as shares of the crypto giant COIN are up more than 214% YTD. The fresh boost was provided after the crypto exchange reached an agreement with Cboe&#8217;s BZX Exchange to maintain a surveillance-sharing agreement for five of its spot Bitcoin ETF applications.</p>
<p>As a result, funds associated with Cathie Wood&#8217;s ARK Investment have rushed to profit from the stock upsurge.</p>
<h2>ARK Invest Offloads COIN</h2>
<p>The investment fund led by Bitcoin bull Cathie Wood had acquired a significant amount of Coinbase shares during the bear market. While Wood is still optimistic about Coinbase in light of a court ruling against the SEC and favor of Ripple&#8217;s XRP, ARK Invest has offloaded $88.5 million worth of COIN shares in the past two weeks.</p>
<p>On July 11, the investment firm sold off $12 million worth of COIN shares just as the stock climbed near a one-year high. Nearly $50.5 million worth of shares, representing 485,000 COIN, were sold on July 14th across three different funds. Three of ARK Investment&#8217;s ETFs cashed in <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coin-shares-climb-10-after-cboe-included-coinbase-in-amended-btc-etf-applications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">COIN&#8217;s recent rally</a>, selling a total of 248,838 shares, worth $26.3 million, based on Monday’s <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/COIN:NASDAQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">closing price</a> of $105.5.</p>
<p>Following a rough start, Coinbase reported a net loss of $79 million in Q1 this year, down from $430 million lost during the same period last year. In a shareholder letter, Coinbase said it was a &#8220;turning point” in building a more efficient and financially disciplined company.</p>
<p>Industry players are turning increasingly bullish on Coinbase as shares of COIN witnessed a turnaround despite the crypto exchange receiving a Wells notice in March and being hammered by a lawsuit from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission in June.</p>
<p>The crypto exchange is expected to release its Q2 earnings early next month.</p>
<h2>Relocating Capital to &#8216;Laggards&#8217;</h2>
<p>The recent moves by ARK Invest are unusual as it made a series of buys of Coinbase&#8217;s stock during crypto winter. However, Wood attributed the sales to simple profit-taking. In a recent Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2023-07-17/cathie-wood-on-ark-fund-flows-coinbase-ai-investments-video" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">interview</a>, the exec said that the investment firm is instead looking to relocate &#8220;capital to perhaps some laggards.&#8221; She added,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Flows are coming back. One of the reasons, ARKK established a base over the last year and it has been trading up and down through that base. I think a lot of investors and more who are technically oriented are looking now at a breakout in our strategy. We&#8217;ll see if it continues. We have enjoyed positive inflows in July, which have cut in half the outflows.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Besides COIN, ARK has also offloaded Tesla (TSLA) shares worth $13 million and instead purchased additional shares of Meta Platforms (META) and Robinhood (HOOD).</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The firm behind LINK hopes to close the gap between traditional banks using their oracle system and other blockchains.
]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chainlink, a leading project focusing on the use of oracles to bring real-world data onto the blockchain and use it for business purposes, has been working on a way to bring its hard-earned, reputable data to partnered projects for quite some time now.</p>
<p>After a long wait, the devs at Chainlink announced the launch of CCIP, the Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol.</p>
<p>For now, CCIP is available on the mainnets of target protocols only in an invitation-based early access system – but not for long.</p>
<h2>Testnet Availability Coming Soon</h2>
<p>CCIPs mainnet launch on the Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, and Optimism blockchains is already in use by the teams at Synthetix and BGD Labs, who are using the Chainlink network to get around the limitations of traditional cross-chain bridges.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">1/ The Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) has officially launched on Avalanche, Ethereum, Optimism, and Polygon mainnets.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LinkTheWorld?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">#LinkTheWorld</a> <a href="https://t.co/SdLVyaapg3" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/SdLVyaapg3</a></p>
<p>— Chainlink (@chainlink) <a href="https://twitter.com/chainlink/status/1680970793331613697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">July 17, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>For non-partnered projects, CCIP will be made available on the testnets of these blockchains on the 20th of July. In the meantime, devs looking to integrate their dApps with Chainlink can sign up for early access and get vetted on the project&#8217;s website.</p>
<h2>Setting New Standards</h2>
<p>According to Chainlink co-founder and acting CEO Sergey Nazarov, the project hopes that CCIP will become the new gold standard for cross-chain interoperability. In a press release celebrating the launch, he likened CCIP to the TCP/IP standard that made the Internet as we know it possible.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Just like key standards such as TCP/IP remade a fragmented early internet into the single global internet we all know and use today, we are making CCIP to connect the fragmented public blockchain landscape and the growing bank chain ecosystem into a single Internet of Contracts.”</p></blockquote>
<p>However, Nazarov also <a href="https://blog.chain.link/ccip-mainnet-early-access/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">stressed</a> that he and his team hope that other devs will find ways to improve the infrastructure he and his team built.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate further development of the protocol, Chainlink gives developers the option to build their own cross-chain solutions on top of CCIP using Arbitrary Messaging and Simplified Token Transfers – both of which will be backed up by the data that has so far enabled over $8 trillion worth of value to be moved on-chain.</p>
<p>Devs who use CCIP will also benefit from the Active Risk Management Network (ARM), a lightweight, independent network created specifically to add an extra layer of security to CCIP.</p>
<blockquote><p>“ARM is a separate, independent network that continually monitors and validates the behavior of the primary CCIP network, providing an additional layer of security by independently verifying cross-chain operations. The ARM Network utilizes a separate, minimal Rust implementation of the Chainlink node software.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The surprise announcement prompted an increase in the market value of LINK. The price of Chainlink’s proprietary token has <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/chainlink-jumps-7-on-cross-chain-news-bitcoin-slipped-to-18-day-low-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">risen</a> by over 6% within the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko, compounding a steady increase in value over the past month.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an ambitious move, the new crypto project BTC20 ($BTC20) has embarked on its token presale, aiming to recreate the early days of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Hosted on the Ethereum blockchain, <a href="https://cryptopotato.care/b__34851?referrer=stake-to-earn-btc20-token-presale-goes-live-aims-to-repeat-bitcoin-bull-run" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">BTC20 ($BTC20)</a> will boast a unique stake-to-earn setup that provides passive income potential for all token holders.</p>
<p>Not only that, but BTC20’s green approach and potential for decentralized application (dApp) integration set it apart from most other new projects in the crowded crypto market.</p>
<h2>Fair $BTC20 Presale Distribution Fosters Strong Community Engagement</h2>
<p>BTC20&#8217;s exciting launch strategy pays homage to Bitcoin, aiming to give investors a taste of the original coin&#8217;s historic gains.</p>
<p>The developers have just launched a presale phase to kickstart the project, aiming to recreate the enthusiasm of Bitcoin&#8217;s early days, when its price eventually reached $1.</p>
<p>Initially, 3 million $BTC20 tokens will be available in the presale, with the soft cap set at $3 million.</p>
<p>Investors can purchase $BTC20 for just $1 per token – and once the soft cap has been hit, the development team intends to provide an &#8220;oversupply&#8221; of 3.05 million $BTC20.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-20.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-261157" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-20.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="271" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-20.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-20-300x135.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-20-50x23.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>This will take the total presale allocation to 6.05 million $BTC20, mirroring an early stage of Bitcoin&#8217;s circulating supply.</p>
<p>Per BTC20’s <a href="https://btc20.com/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">whitepaper</a>, any unsold presale tokens will be added to the staking rewards pool, increasing earning potential for early adopters.</p>
<p>Through this setup, BTC20&#8217;s thoughtfully-designed presale pays homage to Bitcoin&#8217;s history while prioritizing community engagement.</p>
<p>With this approach, the developers aim to foster organic growth through this presale, ensuring that every investor has a stake in the project’s future success.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.care/b__34851?referrer=stake-to-earn-btc20-token-presale-goes-live-aims-to-repeat-bitcoin-bull-run" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><strong>Visit BTC20 Presale</strong></a></p>
<h2>Eco-Friendly Staking Setup Incentivizes Long-Term $BTC20 Holding</h2>
<p>At the core of the BTC20 project lies an innovative staking system that allows token holders to generate a passive income stream.</p>
<p>Leveraging a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus protocol, this setup is designed to be highly energy-efficient relative to Bitcoin&#8217;s Proof-of-Work (PoW) setup.</p>
<p>According to a report by <a href="https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/education_proof_of_stake_paper_v6_0.pdf" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">FTSE Russell</a>, PoS systems consume over 99% less energy than PoW systems – making them much more eco-friendly.</p>
<p>Following BTC20’s presale, 14.95 million $BTC20 tokens will be locked into a staking contract.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-20.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-261156" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-20.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="253" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-20.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-20-300x126.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-20-50x21.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Users who decide to stake their $BTC20 will receive a share of these rewards each time a new block is validated on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>Importantly, the more tokens a user stakes, the higher the percentage of rewards they&#8217;ll earn, incentivizing long-term participation in the project.</p>
<p>Not only that, but users don’t require any expensive mining equipment or computing hardware to benefit from BTC20’s stake-to-earn protocol, making it much more accessible than Bitcoin’s mining setup.</p>
<p>As such, BTC20 holders can earn recurring rewards while supporting a green blockchain ecosystem – a factor that’s contributing to the growing buzz around the project.</p>
<h2>Leveraging Ethereum Powers BTC20 Excitement</h2>
<p>By building on Ethereum’s blockchain infrastructure, <a href="https://cryptopotato.care/b__34851?referrer=stake-to-earn-btc20-token-presale-goes-live-aims-to-repeat-bitcoin-bull-run" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">BTC20</a> unlocks an array of benefits unavailable to the original Bitcoin.</p>
<p>For example, integration with widely-used Ethereum wallets like MetaMask provides increased accessibility for crypto investors.</p>
<p>It also provides scope for $BTC20 to be integrated into thousands of dApps built on the Ethereum blockchain, leading to new and exciting use cases.</p>
<p>Moreover, BTC20&#8217;s stake-to-earn protocol would not be possible using the original Bitcoin protocol, adding another layer of innovation that makes the project stand out.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-13.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-261155" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-13.jpg" alt="Picture4" width="602" height="173" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-13.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-13-300x86.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-13-50x14.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>These factors have combined to help create a palpable buzz around BTC20, even though it is still in the early stages of its life cycle.</p>
<p>BTC20’s <a href="https://twitter.com/BTC20Token" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Twitter page</a> and <a href="https://t.me/BTC20Token" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Telegram channel</a> have welcomed an influx of new members, with investors eager to learn more about the development team&#8217;s ambitions.</p>
<p>Not only that, but crypto influencers have also begun taking note of BTC20’s potential – with leading YouTuber Jacob Bury <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy26n_e2pus&amp;ab_channel=JacobCryptoBury" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">stating</a> that it could be a “10x potential Bitcoin alternative”.</p>
<p>This early excitement highlights BTC20’s appeal, validating its ambitious vision for the future.</p>
<p>With the presale now underway, the stage is set for major growth as the crypto community gets on board with this promising new ecosystem.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[LINK is among the few exceptions today in the green.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price took another turn for the worse in the past 24 hours as the asset fell to an 18-day low of $29,650.</p>
<p>Most altcoins have also turned red, with ETH close to breaking below $1,900. SOL has dumped the most from the larger caps.</p>
<h2>BTC Dips Below $30K</h2>
<p>Bitcoin went on a massive roller-coaster at the end of last week when it pumped from just over $30,000 to $31,800 to register its highest price tag in over a year. This came following Ripple&#8217;s <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/history-in-the-making-with-ripple-scoring-massive-win-in-court-in-xrp-security-case-this-weeks-recap/" data-wpel-link="internal">court win</a> over the SEC.</p>
<p>However, the primary cryptocurrency failed there and nosedived on the following day back down to $30,000. The bulls managed to recover a few hundred dollars by the time the weekend had arrived.</p>
<p>As with most previous ones, this past weekend was also uneventful, and BTC spent it <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/weekend-watch-bitcoin-btc-defends-30k-cardano-ada-drops-4-daily/" data-wpel-link="internal">stuck</a> at $30,300. Monday didn&#8217;t <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/1inch-skyrockets-45-daily-bitcoin-stagnates-above-30k-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">provide</a> any different scenarios either, and it was only during the early trading hours of Tuesday when bitcoin finally made a move.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t a positive one, though, as BTC slumped to $29,650 (on Bitstamp) for the first time since June 30. It has managed to recover most of the losses, but it is still shaky above $30,000.</p>
<p>Its market cap has declined to under $585 billion, and its dominance over the alts is slightly up to 48.6%.</p>

<h2>LINK Defies the Marke Sentiment</h2>
<p>Most altcoins were also calmer during the weekend, but the landscape now is slightly more painful. Ethereum is close to dropping below $1,900 after a 1.4% decline on a daily scale. Ripple and Binance Coin, which exchanged places last week, are down by 0.5% to $0.74 and $242, respectively.</p>
<p>Cardano, Dogecoin, Polkadot, Polygon, Avalanche, and Litecoin have all dropped by between 2-4% in a day. Solana, though, has dumped the most from the larger-cap alts, having lost 6.5% of value. As a result, SOL struggles at $25.</p>
<p>Chainlink is the only notable exception from the top 50 alts. On the news of its cross-chain protocol going live, LINK has soared by 6% and trades above $7.</p>
<p>The total crypto market cap has lost just over $10 billion in a day and sits inches above $1.2 trillion on CMC.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PRESS RELEASE San Francisco, US, July 17th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://portaldefi.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Portal</a>, a self-hosted wallet and true cross-chain Layer-2 DEX built on Bitcoin is thrilled to announce that <a href="https://www.lfg.cash/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">LFG Market</a>, a marketplace for Ordinal NFTs and Bitcoin-based BRC-20 tokens, has chosen to integrate the Portal DEX protocol to offer users cross-chain trading of Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens. The integration of Portal DEX will make cross-chain transactions between Bitcoin and other digital assets fast, secure, and private.</p>
<p>With this, LFG users will be able to purchase the Ordinal NFTs and BRC-20 tokens using assets from other chains, such as Ethereum, without bridges or custodians. Utilizing Portal’s “cross-chain Atomic Swaps” technology for payments in any NFT marketplace is a monumental “first” in the NFT ecosystem.</p>
<blockquote><p>“LFG is looking for solutions that allow ETH and other NFT collectors seamless access to Ordinal trading, and we found Portal to be the best solution available. So it makes total sense to integrate Portal’s DEX protocol,” said LFG Market Co-founder Jason Rosenstein.</p></blockquote>
<p>The creation of Ordinal inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain has led to over $210 million in Ordinals trading volume, according to the latest quarterly report by <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-ordinals-volume-hits-210-million-in-q2-2023" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">DappRadar</a>. With DEXes gaining a <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/231675/crypto-traders-flock-to-dexes-amid-memecoin-mania." target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">stronger foothold</a> in the crypto industry, the interest in NFTs on Bitcoin is only expected to shoot up in the future. According to Nansen, 4% of the US population owns an NFT; but it was almost non-existent on Bitcoin until the Ordinals revolution in 2023.</p>
<p>For Ordinals to truly take off as the value layer for data and information, cross-chain solutions are needed to bring the much bigger non-Bitcoin NFT audiences from across the blockchain space to access Bitcoin Ordinals with security and trust-minimization. Whether it’s Eth NFT fans or Solana NFT fans, there still is no ability to exchange their treasured NFTs in a trust-minimized way across chains. “Bridge” solutions and wrappers are cumbersome, often custodial, and highly vulnerable to security threats.</p>
<p>Portal’s “cross-chain Atomic Swaps” functionality being built into LFG Market and other DEXes allows for stablecoin payments – that today only exist on EVM-compatible chains – seamless access to Bitcoin BRC-20 and Ordinal purchases.</p>
<p>While the LFG Market currently accepts payments only in BTC, other tokens such as ETH, USDC, USDT, and even tokens on Layer 2 EVMs like Arbitrum and others will be accepted after integrating the Portal DEX protocol. Since Portal’s Atomic Swaps operate at Layer 2 without bridging, it is both the safest and least-expensive way to trade cross-chain. Portal is working on supporting as many compatible blockchains, wallets, and DeFi apps as possible.</p>
<p>Portal CEO Chandra Duggirala said, “Based on our research, we know that marketplace and DEX operators value UX and liquidity. We&#8217;ve worked tirelessly to ensure that our infrastructure integrates smoothly with their existing setups, minimizing engineering overhead, while cross-chain liquidity aggregation helps them increase volumes and offer more assets and features to their users.”</p>
<p>Portal believes that blockchains are “specialized” and that each chain is optimized to do one thing, at the expense of other tradeoffs. Bitcoin is purpose-designed to be sound, peer-to-peer money with superior censorship resistance. Ethereum, on the other hand, was designed for composable utility. By enabling seamless swapping of assets between incompatible chains, Portal helps aggregate liquidity across many chains, ending the fragmentation problem and helping marketplaces like LFG and others grow their user bases and value propositions.</p>
<h2>About LFG Market</h2>
<p>LFG’s mission is to create a platform that simplifies and enhances the trading process of Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens. LFG is a seamless and efficient trading environment that enriches the digital asset ecosystem and facilitates novel financial interactions on top of Bitcoin.</p>
<h2>About Portal</h2>
<p>Portal is building the cross-chain DEX protocol and ecosystem tools to help DEXes and users seamlessly own, exchange and contract across blockchains while minimizing custodial risk. With Portal, DeFi becomes a service that anyone can provide, maintaining anonymity within open, transparent markets with a security model as robust as Bitcoin mining.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[SEC chair Gary Gensler has spoken out for the first time since Ripple’s landmark partial victory against the regulator last week, and he’s not happy.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On July 17, Gary Gensler said he was “disappointed” with the judge’s ruling that Ripple’s XRP token was not a security when it was sold to retail investors on exchanges.</p>
<p>The ruling was <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripples-victory-over-sec-is-a-win-for-the-entire-crypto-space-says-brad-garlinghouse/" data-wpel-link="internal">celebrated</a> as good news for the wider crypto industry and retail investors, but Gensler doesn’t agree.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />BREAKING: <a href="https://twitter.com/GaryGensler?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@GaryGensler</a> addresses the <a href="https://twitter.com/Ripple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@Ripple</a> Summary Judgment decision for the first time since last week’s ruling:</p>
<p>“…And while we’re disappointed on what they said about retail investors, we&#8217;re still looking at it, and assessing that.”</p>
<p>— Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) <a href="https://twitter.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1680997005944934401?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">July 17, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Crackdown on Crypto Will Continue</h2>
<p>However, Gensler said he was “pleased” about the decision recognizing the “protection of institutional investors” before adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>“While disappointed on what they said about retail investors, we’re still looking at it and assessing that opinion.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The speech was stuttered, and Gensler appeared simply lost for words at times. The fragmented comments came at an event at the National Press Club on July 17.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he added that the war on crypto will continue despite this loss.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We’re going to continue to try to bring firms that may not be in compliance into compliance — without prejudging any one of them — and try to ensure that we protect the investing public,”</p></blockquote>
<p>The ruling that XRP sales to retail traders did not constitute securities transactions is good news for other crypto assets that Gensler and crew alleged were investment contracts.</p>
<p>In 2020, the SEC accused Ripple of illegally raising $1.3 billion through an unregistered securities sale of XRP. However, Judge Analisa Torres of the Southern District of New York ruled that XRP was not a security in the secondary market sale.</p>
<p>She said Ripple’s algorithmic sales system for XRP on exchanges and trading platforms was not a securities offering (which is similar to a stock offering). Buyers “could not have known if their payments of money went to Ripple,” she said.</p>
<h2>XRP Price Outlook</h2>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-price-analysis/" data-wpel-link="internal">XRP prices</a> skyrocketed more than 80% late last week but have settled in the mid-$0.70 area. The token has lost 2.5% on the day, however, in a fall to $0.738 at the time of writing.</p>
<p>XRP hit its highest level since March 2022 but remains down 78% from its 2018 all-time high of $3.40.</p>
<p>The ruling also boosted several other crypto assets, including Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), and <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-price-stellar-lumens-price-rally-cools-off-but-ypredict-is-rising/" data-wpel-link="internal">Stellar Lumens</a> (XLM). All of these have also been <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/what-does-ripples-victory-over-sec-mean-for-sol-ada-and-other-alleged-security-tokens/" data-wpel-link="internal">labeled securities</a> by the SEC.</p>
