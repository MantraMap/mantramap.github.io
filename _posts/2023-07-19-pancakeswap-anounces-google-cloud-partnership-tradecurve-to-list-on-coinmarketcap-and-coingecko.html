<p>The cryptocurrency market is exciting as prominent projects make significant strides toward mainstream adoption. Today, we explore two notable developments: PancakeSwap price rise following its partnership with Google Cloud and Tradecurve's anticipation of a listing on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko.&nbsp;</p>
&nbsp;
PancakeSwap (CAKE): A Boost From Google Cloud Partnership
<p>PancakeSwap has witnessed a surge in price following its recent partnership with Google Cloud. Collaborating with Google Cloud, a leading cloud computing service provider, brings enhanced security, scalability, and reliability to the PancakeSwap ecosystem.</p>
<p>This partnership enables Google Cloud to provide users with access to BNB endpoints. Additionally, it offers platform scalability, which can handle high traffic. This partnership has instilled confidence among investors and traders, leading to increased demand and a subsequent rise in the PancakeSwap coin price.</p>
<p>Currently, the PancakeSwap coin value sits at $1.51 with a market cap of $315M, a rise of 1.05% in the last 24 hours. Not only that, the PancakeSwap trading volume increased by 37.56% in that same period, reaching $30,248,679. All signs for the PancakeSwap coin are bullish, so experts predict a rise to $1.66 soon.&nbsp;</p>

Tradecurve (TCRV): Awaiting Listing on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko
<p>Tradecurve, the unique trading platform that brings forth the best features of CEX and DEX, has set its sights on securing listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. Tradecurve's visibility and trustworthiness would be significantly increased by being listed on these platforms, bringing in more users and perhaps increasing trading volume.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Supporting Worldwide Traders&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tradecurve will be a borderless trading platform that any trader can sign up for with a working email only. As it requires no sign-up KYC checks, traders will remain completely anonymous as they access all derivatives on one account. Not only that, Tradecurve also offers high leverage, starting at 500:1, and the ability to subscribe to AI-driven trading bots.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tradecurve could become a fan-favorite for millions of worldwide traders. This is with regulation often limiting access to such advanced trading tools and highly leveraged products based on geographical location. This is now slowly becoming a reality as over 12,500 users have registered for Tradecurve, and the number is rising daily.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
Providing an Excellent Return on Investment (ROI)
<p>The platform's native token, TCRV, is now worth $0.018 in Stage 4 of its presale. Those who purchased it during Stage 1 now enjoy an 80% ROI. It has significant long-term potential, and as it moves through the presale phases, the price of each token will rise. The price increase is expected when Stage 5 begins by the end of July, pushing the value up by 40%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TCRV is well-positioned to experience a surge in value. It is expanding its reach into multiple financial markets. This includes the forex market, which saw a $7.5T daily turnaround in April 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Analysts now predict this emerging presale star will soar by 50x before its presale finishes. So sign up for it below and capitalize off of this projected growth.&nbsp;</p>
