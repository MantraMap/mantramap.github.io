<p>Crypto fans and developers have struggled for some time to find a way to bridge the gap between the NFT and blockchain gaming spaces. Significant NFT collections try to include utility and provide value to their holders. However, developing a full-fledged game is frequently beyond the fiscal capacity of such initiatives.</p>
<p>MixMob Racer 1 is an ambitious racing game project developed by MixMob on the Solana blockchain that lets players battle for rewards, stream, and wager on racers and can be played at any time owing to mobile capabilities. Although blockchain technology is still relatively new to the gaming industry, it has significantly impacted the sector's development. There is no disputing that Web3 gaming is still in its infancy; multiple indicators point to a lengthy road ahead before it goes mainstream.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a nutshell, Web3 gaming is revolutionizing the industry by giving gamers myriad new ways to earn a living from their passion. Fungies' internal estimates place the global Web3 gaming industry at around $30 billion by 2030, up from a 2021 value of $5 billion.</p>
MixMob In-Game Economy Driving Stability
<p>According to an announcement on January 24th, users may use SUD$ to enter Arenas and compete for extra SUD$ in various gameplay modes, including Rookie, Hero, and Degen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the release of the mobile version of MixMob: Racer 1, powered by Solana, the developer anticipates a significant uptick in the game's user base. Non-racers can earn SUD$ thanks to the game's new and improved streaming and wagering features. Later on, users can trade in the SUD$ for digital collectibles, season game passes, and other cool perks.</p>
<p>According to the release, MixMob's in-house data scientists ran hundreds of simulations of the economy and came up with a model that works for the project and its players.</p>
<p>SUD$ is an abbreviation for Subdomain Dollars, the currency used in the MixMob universe and named after the Subdomain where all MixMob members live. The SUD$ are used in the game to enter racing contests, wager, purchase digital items, and more.</p>
<p>The major goal of SUD$ in this release is to improve the game's in-game economics; hence, they can only be won or purchased in packs via MixMob's MixLab. SUD$ may be won through playing the game, referring new players, or holding one of MixMob's Gen0 Masks. Those who have previously competed in MixMob competitions, staked their Masks, or battled to become MixMob MVPs have all earned SUD$ that they can use in the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On January 24, 2022, the public will be given a URL to the game via which they can access it. Members of the community will also be given a referral link that they can use to challenge their friends and increase their chances of winning rewards. During Alpha V3, players can access PvP (Player vs. Player) and PvE (Player vs. Environment) modes.</p>
