										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/fsb-regulatory-framework-crypto/">FSB Finalizes Global Regulatory Framework for Crypto</a></p>
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB), an international body that oversees and advises on the global financial system, has come up with the final version of the global regulatory framework for crypto-asset activities. Basically, the <a href="https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P170723-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">document</a> released by FSB consists of recommendations for companies involved in crypto activity, and these recommendations are divided into two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>high-level recommendations for the regulation, supervision and oversight of crypto-asset activities and markets;</li>
<li>revised high-level recommendations for the regulation, supervision, and oversight of “global stablecoin” arrangements.</li>
</ul>
<p>The aim of FSB was to provide a regulatory framework that would comply with the principle of &#8220;same activity, same risk, same regulation&#8221; and cover all possible risks related to crypto activity. According to FSB, crypto-asset activities must be regulated based on their economic functions and the risks they pose.</p>
<p>In addition to recommendations, FSB has collaborated with sectoral standard-setting bodies (SSBs) and come up with a work plan to mitigate various risks that cryptos might pose. Those include AML/CFT, data privacy, cyber security, consumer and investor protection, market integrity, competition policy, and more.</p>
<p>FSB commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Final recommendations incorporate learnings from events of the past year in crypto-asset markets and feedback received during the FSB’s public consultation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<div title="Page 10">
<div>
<div>
<p>Next, in September, the FSB and the IMF will deliver a joint report to the G20 that will synthesise the policy findings from work of the Funf on macroeconomic and monetary issues. Further, by the end of 2025, the FSB will review the status of the implementation of the recommendations at the jurisdictional level. In partnership with the IMF and the World Bank, the FSB will oversee applying the proposed standards in daily practice.</p>
<p>Aspects, where the work has already started, include multifunction crypto-asset intermediaries, banks’ stablecoin exposures and related activities, and tokenization.</p>
<h2>Need for Proper Risk Management</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>How did FSB develop the crypto regulatory framework? At the beginning of 2022, the crypto market was turmoiled by a chain of events that led to a sharp decrease in crypto assets. The collapse of Terra (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/terra/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LUNA</a>), the third largest cryptocurrency ecosystem after Bitcoin (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC</a>) and Ethereum (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ETH</a>) at that time, the bankruptcy of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ieo/platform/ftx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX exchange</a>, the crash of the crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC), the banking crisis, and the global economic decline showed the need to predict and protect against the risks caused by high volatility of crypto-asset markets.</p>
<p>However, the approach to regulating crypto markets is different in the US, Europe, and Asia. Different jurisdictions have different views on what should be done with digital assets. In the case of the FSB, the framework provided calls for stricter regulation, but it does not cover all aspects of crypto-related activity. It does not include stablecoins and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Central Bank Digital Currencies</a> (CBDCs), which are also important and popular tools offered by the industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/nab-payments-crypto-exchanges/">NAB Blocks Payments to High-Risk Crypto Exchanges to Curb Scam Losses</a></p>

<p>National Australia Bank (NAB) will begin blocking payments to high-risk crypto exchanges in an effort to curb scam losses. NAB <a href="https://news.nab.com.au/news/scam-strategy-update/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a> the ban on Monday. It noted that it was taking action to protect its customers from the risks associated with cryptocurrency.</p>
<h2>NAB’s Move Is Part of a Wider Trend</h2>
<p>According to the NAB, it has stopped over $270 million worth of customer payments between March and July using payment prompts. Insights from the NAB app show 12% of payments were abandoned when customers received a real-time payment prompt in the app.</p>
<p>Again, recent data from the Australian Financial Crimes Exchange showed that 50% of reported scam funds had cryptocurrency linkage. With over $1.5 billion lost to investment scams by Australians in 2022 and about $221 million of that to crypto scams the threat posed by scam losses is great.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Westpac and the Commonwealth Bank reportedly halted payments to Binance. ANZ also noted that it would start preventing payment to particular high-risk crypto trading platforms. Thus, the move to block payment to crypto exchanges is the latest in a series of measures by Australian banks to restrict cryptocurrency transactions.</p>
<h2>Ban to Affect High-Risk Crypto Exchanges</h2>
<p>While the ban is expected to affect Binance, NAB did not identify any specific cryptocurrency exchanges, noting its approach will be “consistent with the industry”. However, the bank stated that it will affect “high-risk” platforms with more scam events.</p>
<p>According to NAB executive for group investigations and fraud Chris Sheehan, they have observed many scammers using cryptocurrency platforms to quickly launder stolen funds. “We want to make it as hard as possible for these criminals and reduce the impact on our customers,” he said.</p>
<h2>Multiplied Woes</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, a ban that affects Binance’s operations will only increase its woes in Australia. The Australian Securities and Investment Commission canceled its local derivatives license in April. Later in May, Binance lost its local banking partner Cuscal. The Australian regulator has also <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-australia-offices-raided/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly</a> begun a probe into Binance&#8217;s operations in the country.</p>
<p>And it isn’t just Australia. Binance has come under fire in many of its operational jurisdictions in recent times. In the US, The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/cftc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CFTC</a>) and the SEC have accused Binance of operating without proper license and improper handling of customer funds. In the Netherlands, the exchange was forced to withdraw after failing to secure a license. The company is also facing accusations of illegal operations in France.</p>
<p>Despite the regulatory assaults, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has reiterated the company’s commitment to regulation. He <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/from-cz/binance-turns-6-8188278446020229815" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> that they &#8220;are not just open but eager to collaborate with policymakers to shape the future of digital assets&#8221;.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-internal-email-layoff/">Alleged Binance Internal Email Suggests Recent Layoff Is Due to Decline in Profit</a></p>
<p>The recent layoff at Binance affected more than 1,000 employees, which has sparked the interest of many in the crypto community. This downsizing comes at a time when reports indicate that some senior executives have left the company following Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao’s response to the US Department of Justice.</p>
<p>The regulatory issues <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> is facing also suggest it could be going through a difficult time. One of the latest reports around Binance’s case with the SEC is that Eeon, an entity representing Binance customers, seeks compensation from the exchange and the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>. Eeon claims that Binance customers’ interests have not been adequately protected by the crypto company and the regulators’ legal representatives. The entity wants compensation of 20% daily from the value of funds received from each customer, which amounts to $1,000 daily.</p>
<p>Adam Cochran, founder of Cinneamhain Ventures, shared a series of tweets on <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/twitter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a> showing that there was an internal email that revealed more about the layoffs. According to his posts, Binance is laying off workers mainly for cost-cutting measures. This information goes against the claim of Binance’s CEO that the company’s reason for downsizing is only a bid to get suitable talent.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/10</p>
<p>Hey <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@cz_binance</a> if your layoffs weren&#39;t about cost cutting, why on June 19th did you announce on WEA that you suddenly cut extended benefits for all employees, &amp; *tell them* it was because of &quot;a decline in profit&quot;?</p>
<p>Not exactly trust building to lie about this&#8230; <a href="https://t.co/2MvP1ZPKEG">pic.twitter.com/2MvP1ZPKEG</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Adam Cochran (adamscochran.eth) (@adamscochran) <a href="https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1680648344471842817?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 16, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Adam challenged the company about why it is claiming the layoff is not about cost-cutting when, on June 19, the company announced that it needed to cut its workers’ extended benefits due to a profit decline caused by the present industry environment and regulatory issues. Binance also noted in the email that it would take other actions in the future in a bid to cut costs, and the reduction in the number of workers looks like another move in that direction.</p>
<h2>Binance CEO Denies Reports Spreading Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt in the Crypto Industry</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/changpeng-zhao/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Changpeng Zhao</a> insists such reports are FUD, aiming to create fear, uncertainty, and doubt in the crypto industry. He claimed that the reported scale of the layoff at Binance was exaggerated. Furthermore, Zhao emphasized that the company is actively hiring, contrary to the perception that the layoffs are solely due to profit decline. The CEO insists that the company is rather looking for individuals who are a better fit for the company. He <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1679951762906595330" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As we continuously strive to increase talent density, there are involuntary terminations. This happens in every company. The numbers reported by media are all way off. 4 FUD. On the bright side, they just can’t resist talking about us. We are still hiring.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Regarding the resignation of senior executives, the CEO mentioned that the reports about why the executives left are also wrong, and they are only spreading fear, doubt, and uncertainty in the crypto community.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/unstoppable-domains-ethereum-eth/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/unstoppable-domains-ethereum-eth/">Unstoppable Domains Partners with Ethereum Name Service, Adds .eth Domains</a></p>
<p>In the latest development, the digital identity platform Unstoppable Domains added support for Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domains, in order to expand their offerings of Web3 decentralized domains.</p>
<p>In the Web3 domains space, Unstoppable Domains and Ethereum Name Service have been the two biggest service providers in the market. These players allow users to create human-readable domain names along with other crypto wallet addresses. Furthermore, decentralized domains act as a profile across the Web3 ecosystem while unlocking a host of different functionalities.</p>
<p>The introduction of .eth domain endings allows individuals to store their digital identity on the Ethereum blockchain. For e.g. .eth domains, allows users to replace their long wallet address (such as 0x74Fe1103d28fb79F4d83800003983390Dfc61234) with a shorter, easier-to-remember name like &#8220;me.eth&#8221;. With Unstoppable Domains, users will also be able to manage .nft or .x domains, all from a single place.</p>
<h2>Here&#8217;s What Unstoppable Domains Users Can Do</h2>
<p>Now, users have the option to purchase .eth names through Unstoppable, offering additional payment methods and functionality to simplify the management of ENS domains. When users buy .eth domains from Unstoppable, they undergo registrations through the ENS smart contract and provide the same features as domains registered directly through ENS.</p>
<p>Unstoppable also allows users to purchase .eth domains without connecting them to an existing Ether wallet. This is possible through Unstoppable Vault, a noncustodial service that enables users to secure Web3 domains even if they don&#8217;t have a cryptocurrency wallet initially.</p>
<p>To make things even more convenient, Unstoppable offers an auto-renewal mechanism for ENS users. This eliminates the need to manually renew .eth domains on the blockchain and minimizes the risk of losing a domain.</p>
<p>The integration with Unstoppable expands the payment options for .eth users. Users can now purchase their desired Web3 domain using various payment methods, including <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a>, 12 different cryptocurrencies, as well as conventional fiat options like credit cards, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/paypal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PayPal</a>, Google Pay, and Apple Pay.</p>
<p>With a combined total of 6.3 million registered domains, Unstoppable Domains and ENS are at the forefront of digital identity preservation. Matt Gould, the CEO and Co-Founder of Unstoppable Domains, emphasized the importance of simplifying the process of purchasing .eth domains to attract users who may not be familiar with Web3 technology. Speaking to CoinDesk, he <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/web3/2023/07/17/unstoppable-adds-support-for-ens-domains/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“People want to have a one place to manage all their Web3 domains across all different platforms. They don&#8217;t want to have to think about having to pay with a whole bunch of different types of cryptocurrency or having 1,000 different wallets they have to keep track of…that&#8217;s kind of that&#8217;s the experience that we&#8217;re leaning into.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Unstoppable Building .eth Management Tools</h2>
<p>Unstoppable is actively working on developing tools to manage .eth domains, which will offer features such as setting cryptocurrency addresses, managing on-chain profile data, and facilitating domain transfers.</p>
<p>While users who purchase .eth domains through Unstoppable can benefit from ENS integrations, it&#8217;s important to note that these domains will not be compatible with Unstoppable&#8217;s own set of approximately 800 integrations.</p>
<p>Additionally, Unstoppable provides support for various Web3 domains, including .nft, .crypto, .wallet, .dao, .bitcoin, .polygon, .BinanceUS, and .blockchain.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/aave-gho-stablecoin-ethereum-mainnet/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

<p>Decentralized finance (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-decentralized-finance-defi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeFi</a>) protocol Aave has launched its GHO stablecoin on the Ethereum mainnet. The launch, which appears to have been well received, saw the circulating supply of the stablecoin quickly increase by $1.5 million within 24 hours of the launch. As of publication, however, over $2.19 million worth of GHO has now been minted.</p>
<p>The launch came shortly after an interesting community governance vote, which saw nearly all 424 participating addresses vote in favor of the new stablecoin.</p>

<p>According to Aave&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/AaveAave/status/1680216586047885312?t=uTNdK7_rN0SohnMMU_Nwdg&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announcement</a>, the algorithmic GHO stablecoin is pegged against the United States dollar and is backed by several digital assets. Most notably, its reserves include Ethereum’s native currency Ether (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ETH</a>), and Aave’s native token AAVE.</p>
<p>It might be worth mentioning that centralized stablecoins such as Tether (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/tether/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USDT</a>) continue to be subject to criticism. And most of the criticism usually borders around what appears to be a lack of transparency around its reserves.</p>
<p>However, Aave has moved to build on this key area of transparency with the GHO. To this end, the protocol highlighted that all assets backing the GHO stablecoin are fully verifiable and transparent even as on-chain data can confirm. Aave wrote in part:</p>
<blockquote><p>“All data regarding GHO transactions is available and auditable directly from the blockchain or via numerous user interfaces.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>GHO Stablecoin Adds to the Growing Ranks of Algorithmic Stablecoins</h2>
<p>From all indications, it may appear that DeFi-native algorithmic stablecoins are gradually growing through the ranks.</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, MakerDAO&#8217;s DAI is arguably the first and foremost choice among algorithmic stablecoins at the moment. As of press time, the Ethereum-based stablecoin has a $4.28 billion market capitalization, per DefiLlama <a href="https://defillama.com/stablecoins">data</a>.</p>
<p>Also, there are other prominent algorithmic stablecoins including Frax, Ampleforth, and the rest. But the more recent addition was when DeFi protocol Curve also launched its flagship algorithmic stablecoin crvUSD in May.</p>
<p>Despite this growing trend, however, it should be noted that the general stablecoin market remains dominated by centralized issuers. That is Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC). The duo alone accounts for at least 87% of the total circulating supply of all US dollar-pegged stablecoins.</p>
<p>With Aave&#8217;s GHO, however, algorithmic stablecoins are also gradually coming up.  At the time of publication, GHO is trading slightly below the desired $1 peg at $0.9898. Although it fell lower to $0.9814 earlier on July 16, according to CoinMarketCap <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/gho/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">data</a>.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/tesla-first-cybertruck-2023/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/tesla-first-cybertruck-2023/">Tesla Builds First Cybertruck after Years of Delay, Schedules Mass Production for End of 2023</a></p>
<p>First introduced in 2019, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/tesla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tesla Inc</a> (NASDAQ: TSLA) has finally announced the building of its Cybertruck ahead of its Q2 2023 earnings call. The EV maker revealed the first Cybertruck built at Giga, Texas, during the weekend. When CEO <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/elon-musk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elon Musk</a> unveiled the Cybertruck at the Tesla Design Center in California in November 2019, the company noted that it would be in three variants. It also scheduled the production and delivery for 2021.</p>
<p>However, Tesla could not deliver the Cybertruck as planned and set a new production schedule for <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/tesla-cybertruck-production-2023/">summer 2023</a>. The CEO noted that the long-awaited Cybertruck could be the best product ever by Tesla when it becomes available before the end of 2023. Also, the company’s executives mentioned the incoming vehicle during the last earnings call. The executives said during the Q1 2023 earnings report that the team will organize a delivery event for the Cybertruck towards the end of the year.</p>
<h2>Tesla Builds First Cybertruck in 2023</h2>
<p>According to Tesla, the delay in the Cybertruck production was due to standard supply chain issues. In contrast to the company’s statement, leaked documents revealed some flaws in the vehicle’s basic design and engineering. A whistleblower revealed in January 2022 that the Cybertruck had challenges with structures, sealing, braking, and more. Despite the dark revelations, there were more than 1.5 million reservations for the vehicle as of November 2022.</p>
<p>With such a pace, there are probably more people interested in the Tesla Cybertruck this year, and more could show interest before the end of 2023. Notably, the company recorded over 250,000 reservations within a week of unveiling the vehicle. Tesla has allowed customers to deposit a nonrefundable $100 fee to pro-order since 2019.</p>
<p>In May, Musk told shareholders at the 2023 annual meeting that Tesla could deliver between 250,000 and 500,000 units yearly as soon as the production of the Cybertruck begins. While Kelley Blue Book stated that the Cybertruck would price from $50,000 for the single motor and rear-wheel drive model, Tesla may change the prices before the end of the year. On the other hand, the all-wheel drive version, with a towing capacity of over 10,000 pounds and more than 300 miles of range, could cost about $60,000. The most expensive variant of the Tesla Cybertruck will have three electric motors and all-wheel drive, a towing capacity of 14,000 pounds, and a battery range of over 500 miles. This will cost around $70,000.</p>
<p>Following the mass production of the Tesla Cybertruck before the end of 2023, it will have to compete with other electric pickups in the market. <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ford/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ford</a>’s F-150 Lightning has been making waves in the market, costing about $60,000.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/fintech-raisin-e50b-deposits/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/fintech-raisin-e50b-deposits/">German Fintech Company Raisin Anticipates €50B in Deposits for 2023</a></p>
<p>Raisin, a German fintech firm specializing in financial technology solutions, expects a surge in deposits this year as banks seek alternative funding options amid the end of cheap central bank cash. The Berlin-based company, formerly known as SaveBetter, was launched in 2013 and is backed by notable financial services companies, including <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/goldman-sachs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Goldman Sachs</a>, Deutsche Bank, and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/paypal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PayPal</a>. The fintech firm anticipates that the deposits it facilitates will exceed €50 billion ($56 billion) by the end of the year, surpassing its current €43 billion mark, Bloomberg reported Monday, citing an interview with the company&#8217;s CEO.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-17/goldman-backed-fintech-raisin-to-boost-deposits-to-50-billion" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a>, Raisin CEO Tamaz Georgadze shared these projections in an interview, emphasizing that more than half of the growth is expected to originate from countries outside the euro region, particularly the United Kingdom and the United States.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s projection comes as central banks across the globe raise interest rates and unwind economic stimulus measures to combat inflation. Banks find themselves faced with both profitable prospects and higher funding costs. Against the backdrop of recent bank failures, including that of Silicon Valley Bank and Silvergate Bank, financial watchdogs are intensifying their oversight of bank liquidity, potentially leading to increased scrutiny of deposit brokers and marketplaces such as Raisin.</p>
<h2>Fintech Firm Raisin Sets Itself Apart from Deposit Broker Status in the US</h2>
<p>During the interview, the Raisin CEO refuted concerns a senior European official raised last week regarding the stability of deposits facilitated through the company. He clarified that Raisin does not fall under the definition of a deposit broker in the US, as its fixed-term deposits are not tradable securities. Furthermore, Georgadze stated that less than 1% of the company&#8217;s clients engage in constant fund transfers between overnight funds, commonly called &#8220;interest rate hoppers&#8221;.</p>
<p>Contrary to the notion that deposits facilitated by the fintech firm Raisin are prone to rapid withdrawals, Georgadze argued that they tend to display greater resilience during times of crisis. He further explained that clients geographically distant from banks are less influenced by local events, reducing the likelihood of impulsive reactions.</p>
<p>&#8220;These deposits are actually stickier than others in crises. The further away the client is, the more detached they are from events at the bank. They don&#8217;t look out the window and see a line of people outside a bank branch,&#8221; Georgadze said.</p>
<p>While banks witnessed a considerable increase in net interest income last year due to interest rate hikes by central banks such as the European Central Bank and the US Federal Reserve, they have been slow to pass on these benefits to retail clients, with only a fraction of the increased rates being offered to them. Georgadze raised pertinent questions regarding the lack of higher rates for smaller depositors and underscored Raisin&#8217;s ability to outperform the market average by promptly implementing the European Central Bank&#8217;s rates.</p>
<h2>Raisin Plan to Onboard More Banks on Its Platform This Year</h2>
<p>Raisin has ambitious expansion plans to add 25 to 30 new banks to its platform this year, with a particular focus on the United States. Georgadze stressed that deposits sourced through the company offer banks a more cost-effective funding option compared to bonds. This holds special significance in Europe, where banks repay hundreds of billions of euros in European Central Bank stimulus loans.</p>
<p>Commenting on the changing landscape of wholesale funding, the Raisin boss acknowledged the end of the era of free funding from the European Central Bank. In light of this, Raisin&#8217;s role as an intermediary has become increasingly valuable for financial service companies seeking affordable funding sources.</p>
<p>Earlier in March, the company <a href="https://financialit.net/news/fundraising-news/raisin-announces-eu60-million-funding" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">secured</a> €60 million in a series E funding round from new and existing investors. According to the company CEO, the funds will be used to increase its product offerings to strengthen its position in the financial market further.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ai-adoption-bubble-stability-ai/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ai-adoption-bubble-stability-ai/">AI Is Not Ready for Large Scale Adoption but Will Be Biggest Bubble of All Time, Says Stability AI CEO</a></p>
<p>The chief executive officer of open-source artificial intelligence company Stability AI has predicted that artificial intelligence (AI) will be the &#8220;biggest bubble of all time&#8221;. Speaking to <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ubs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UBS</a> analysts last week, CEO Emad Mostaque praised the technology but added that it is still in its early stages.</p>
<p>On the call, Mostaque said AI requires an investment of up to $1 trillion because it is more important than 5G and such a “massive market” that banks would have no choice but to use it. However, he said that although everyone can see its usefulness, AI is generally “not quite ready” for large-scale adoption in big industries. Nonetheless, he believes AI is a bubble, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I call it the ‘dotAI’ bubble, and it hasn’t even started yet.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Mostaque also said that organizations that do not appropriately use AI could see a plunge in stock or valuation. The CEO used Google as an example, reminding that the company <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-ai-chatbot-bard-offers-inaccurate-information-company-ad-2023-02-08/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">suffered a $100 billion loss</a> within 24 hours after its Bard AI supplied false info in an ad. Shares of Alphabet Inc, Google’s parent company, fell 9% following the mistake.</p>
<p>In the ad, Google’s Bard stated that the James Webb Space Telescope “took the very first pictures of a planet outside our own solar system.” The information turned out to be <a href="https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/resources/300/2m1207-b-first-image-of-an-exoplanet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">false</a>.</p>
<p>Mostaque also told the UBS analysts that he believes AI investment will skyrocket over the next few years. However, he doesn’t think that the AI investment market offers a lot of options.</p>
<p>“I think this is real. I think that there aren’t many investable opportunities here, and you’ll see people moving from the best chip manufacturers to companies that are using this to impact their bottom line and their top line appropriately. And you will see the market punishing those that don’t use this,” said he.</p>
<h2>Mostaque Has Raised $100M despite Thoughts on AI Bubble</h2>
<p>Stability AI is the artificial intelligence firm that collaborated on Stable Diffusion, a deep learning text-to-image AI model. Regardless of Mostaque’s belief that AI is a bubble, Stable Diffusion already has over one million users and has received $100 million in funding from Lightspeed Venture Partners and Coatur.</p>
<p>Mostaque was recently at the center of accusations about his past. The CEO was accused of deliberately falsifying claims about his achievements and background. Early last month, Mostaque published a <a href="https://emad.posthaven.com/on-setting-the-record-straight" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a> where he directly responded to the allegations.</p>
<h2>AI Oversight</h2>
<p>Several stakeholders and regulators have called for proper oversight over the development and adoption of AI tools. Early this month, Tesla CEO and Twitter owner Elon Musk <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/elon-musk-artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spoke</a> about regulatory involvement in the exploding AI sector. During a keynote address at an AI conference on July 5th, Musk specified regulation of several AI uses, including the adoption of self-driving vehicles and robots.</p>
<p>Musk also warned that developers must be careful with creating AI because it is “smarter than all humans at everything”.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-bitcoin-lightning-integration/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-bitcoin-lightning-integration/">Crypto Exchange Binance Completes Bitcoin Lightning Integration</a></p>
<p>In the latest <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-completes-integration-of-bitcoin-btc-on-lightning-network-opens-deposits-and-withdrawals-eefbfae2c0ae472d9e1e36f1a30bf340?ref=AZTKZ9XS&amp;utm_source=BinanceTwitter&amp;utm_medium=GlobalSocial&amp;utm_campaign=GlobalSocial" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announcement</a> earlier today, July 17, crypto exchange <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> revealed that it has completed the integration of the Bitcoin Lightning Network. As a result, Binance users can conduct deposits and withdrawals atop the Bitcoin Lightning Network.</p>
<p>The official statement reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Binance has completed the integration of Bitcoin (BTC) on the Lightning Network. Deposits and withdrawals for Bitcoin (BTC) are now open on the Lightning Network&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thus, Binance users now have the option to choose &#8220;LIGHTNING&#8221; when withdrawing or depositing <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a>. They can also select other options such as BNB Smart Chain (BEP-20), Bitcoin, BNB Beacon Chain (BEP2), BTC (SegWit), and Ethereum ERC-20.</p>

<p>&mdash; Binance (@binance) <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1680777249090576385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 17, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The Bitcoin Lightning Network is a Layer-2 scalability platform for the Bitcoin blockchain that helps in reducing network congestion and facilitating low-cost payments.</p>
<p>Binance has been working on integrating Bitcoin Lightning technology for the past two months. In early May 2023, Binance temporarily halted withdrawals due to a significant increase in Bitcoin transaction fees caused by heightened Bitcoin Ordinals activity.</p>
<p>In June, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-lightning-network-nodes-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> their efforts to integrate the Bitcoin Lightning Network. This integration aims to make Bitcoin transactions faster and more scalable, providing users with smoother experiences by reducing transaction costs and speeding up transaction times.</p>
<p>The integration of the Lightning Network also enhances the overall efficiency and convenience of using Bitcoin. It improves Bitcoin&#8217;s scalability by utilizing off-chain capabilities, addressing issues like network congestion and transaction delays.</p>
<p>Binance has joined other well-known exchanges like Bitfinex, River Financial, OKX, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/kraken/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kraken</a>, and CoinCorner in adopting the Lightning Network. This network has gained popularity among exchanges for its benefits in Bitcoin transactions.</p>
<p>In April, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong expressed interest in integrating the Bitcoin layer 2 network on Coinbase, but no specific timeline has been provided for its implementation yet.</p>
<h2>Lightning Labs Unveils New Tools for AI Developers</h2>
<p>Lightning Labs, a company involved in developing the Lightning Network for Bitcoin, has <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/lightning-labs-tools-bitcoin-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced new tools</a> that enable the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) applications like Open AI&#8217;s ChatGPT with the Bitcoin network.</p>
<p>According to Lightning Labs, a major challenge with current Large Language Models is the absence of a built-in method for making payments over the Internet.</p>
<p>In their announcement on July 6, the company stated that these new tools will enhance the speed, affordability, and accessibility of Bitcoin-based payments for AI developers. This will enable them to move away from traditional, costly, and limited payment methods and utilize the Lightning Network&#8217;s solution instead.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ola-electric-mobility-ipo/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

<p>India’s electric two-wheeler manufacturer, Ola Electric Mobility Pvt. Ltd., is now <a href="https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/from-ola-motorbike-and-car-launch-to-ipo-ceo-bhavish-aggarwal-shares-future-plan-of-the-firm-ola-electric-ola-cab-11689554373540.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">preparing</a> for an Initial Public Offering (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-initial-public-offering-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IPO</a>) much sooner than initially anticipated following its exceptional growth and market response.</p>
<p>This IPO will further solidify Ola Electric Mobility’s position as a key player in India’s Electric Vehicle (EV) market and support its ambitious goals for expansion and innovation.</p>
<h2>A Whirlwind Pace of Growth for Ola Electric</h2>
<p>Since it entered the market, Ola Electric has experienced a whirlwind pace of growth. The company launched its first electric scooter, the Ola S1, in late 2021, which garnered significant attention and demand from consumers across the country.</p>
<p>According to a recent <a href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/ola-electrics-founder-advances-plan-for-ipo-and-evs/article67089191.ece" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a>, Founder and CEO Bhavish Aggarwal expressed astonishment at the rapid expansion of Ola Electric in an interview, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I thought it would take me four to six years of revenue to go public. Ola Electric has grown and matured faster than I had initially planned because the market response has been very strong.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Aggarwal’s realization of the company’s accelerated trajectory highlights the immense market demand for sustainable transportation solutions in India. Data from the Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles reveals that Ola Electric has sold over 239,000 electric scooters since December 2021.</p>
<p>The CEO noted that the company’s early demand primarily came from first-time scooter buyers. However, as Ola Electric increased in popularity and repute, the consumer profile moved to people who were already convinced of the benefits of electric scooters.</p>
<p>Accordingly, Ola Electric’s market share in India’s EV sector stands at an impressive 38%. This remarkable achievement is a testament to the company’s focus on delivering high-quality, affordable electric scooters that meet the needs of Indian consumers.</p>
<p>Ola Electric’s success is not only reflected in its market share and sales figures but also in the confidence shown by its investors. Backed by major investors like <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/softbank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SoftBank Group Corp</a> (TYO: 9984) and Tiger Global Management, Ola Electric has secured significant financial support and strategic guidance since its inception.</p>
<h2>Strategic Investments and Expansion</h2>
<p>Ola Electric’s vision extends beyond electric scooters, as it plans to diversify its product portfolio with the launch of a motorbike by the end of 2023. Additionally, the company’s CEO announced plans to introduce a battery-powered car in 2024, signaling its foray into the four-wheeler EV market.</p>
<p>Aggarwal also expressed his intention to export Ola Electric scooters to Southeast Asia, Latin America, and Europe. This strategic move aims to capitalize on the growing global demand for electric scooters and expand the company’s footprint beyond India.</p>
<p>In the midst of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/tesla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tesla Inc</a>&#8216;s (NASDAQ: TSLA) global popularity and its upcoming <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/tsla-stock-jumps-5-on-tuesday-as-tesla-plans-expansion-to-india/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entry</a> into the Indian market, Ola Electric is constructing a 115-acre battery factory in southern India. This factory will focus on producing lithium-ion cells primarily for Ola Electric vehicles. Aggarwal believes that designing vehicles from scratch will enable Ola Electric to sell cars on a larger scale and increase profit margins.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/microsoft-sony-10-year-deal-playstation-2/" rel="prev">next</a></p>
