            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, a token that&#8217;s closely related to the Shiba Inu ecosystem has been making headlines. The cryptocurrency in question is called BAD, and it&#8217;s short for Blockchain + AI + DAO.</p>
<p>Throughout the past 24 hours alone, BAD&#8217;s price is up 20%, bringing its total monthly gains up to around 440%. But why?</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bad_shib_cover.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266519" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bad_shib_cover.jpg" alt="bad_shib_cover" width="1201" height="720" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bad_shib_cover.jpg 1201w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bad_shib_cover-300x180.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bad_shib_cover-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bad_shib_cover-768x460.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bad_shib_cover-50x30.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1201px) 100vw, 1201px" /></a></p>
<h2>Shiba Inu and Bad Idea: What&#8217;s the Relationship?</h2>
<p>Right off the bad, it&#8217;s important to note that BAD is a token that brings forward a decentralized experiment, seeking to combine Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/what-is-dao/" data-wpel-link="internal">Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)</a> in a &#8220;risky, meme-worth concoction.&#8221;</p>
<p>In essence, the planning of the project, as well as other tasks, are handed to the community.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also been a notable relationship between BAD and Shiba Inu. Earlier in August, the lead developer of SHIB &#8211; Shytoshi Kusama &#8211; pointed out how he sees the partnership going forward.</p>
<blockquote><p>BAD has more to do with our next phase than just a silly voice in a keynote. It&#8217;s about being thought leaders in a world of copycats.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Why is BAD Price Pumping?</h2>
<p>BAD&#8217;s been on a roll during the last 30 days, as the cryptocurrency has surged by more than 440% throughout the period.</p>
<figure id="attachment_266517" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-266517" style="width: 689px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-15-135321.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-266517" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-15-135321.jpg" alt="Screenshot 2023-08-15 135321" width="689" height="463" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-15-135321.jpg 689w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-15-135321-300x202.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-15-135321-50x34.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 689px) 100vw, 689px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-266517" class="wp-caption-text">BAD Price. Source: CoinGecko</figcaption></figure>
<p>As it can be seen in the chart above, the surge started more or less when Kusama posted about the long-term plans of Shiba Inu, including Bad Idea.</p>
<p>Moreover, Shiba Inu&#8217;s marketing strategist, Lucie, has also recently highlighted the partnership between both projects, pushing the community to vote in favor of a free audit for BAD through CertiK.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Institutional invetors will be able to enter the BTC ecosystem and meet ESG goals at the same time, said Jacobi.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While the US SEC continues to reject or delay, at best, all spot Bitcoin ETF applications, such a product has seen the light of day in Europe.</p>
<p>Called the Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF, it will be the first similar product compliant with SFDR Article 8 through its decarbonization strategy.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230815404630/en/Jacobi-Asset-Management-lists-Europe" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">press release</a> dated August 15 informs that the spot Bitcoin ETF will be the brainchild of Jacobi Asset Management and Wilshire Indexes. It will be under the ticker BCOIN and has already been listed on Euronext Amsterdam.</li>
<li>Jacobi said it had &#8220;implemented a verifiable built-in Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) solution which allows institutional investors to access the benefits of Bitcoin whilst also meeting ESG goals.&#8221;</li>
<li>The ETF will be regulated by the Guernsey Financial Services Commission (GFSC). Fidelity Digital Assets will be the custodian, Flow Traders will serve as market makers, and Jane Street and DRW will be Authorized Participants.</li>
<li>Wilshire Indexes&#8217; CEO &#8211; Mark Makepeace, commented:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>“The launch of the Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF is an important milestone for the digital asset industry and a transformative moment for the global financial industry. We are excited about the partnership with Jacobi and, as a leader in the development of institutional-grade digital asset benchmarks, we are committed to helping accelerate the advancement of the entire digital asset ecosystem.”</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Spot Bitcoin ETFs have launched in a couple of other countries in the past few years, including Brazil and Canada. However, the US securities watchdog &#8211; the SEC &#8211; continues to reject all applications for such a product.</li>
<li>Nevertheless, the landscape can change soon as the world&#8217;s largest asset manager &#8211; BlackRock &#8211; <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/blackrocks-etf-success-rate-with-the-sec-is-575-to-1-what-about-its-bitcoin-application/" data-wpel-link="internal">filed</a> for a spot Bitcoin ETF in mid-June.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[The XRP Ledger (XRPL) has gained significant popularity recently due to its fast transaction speed and low cost.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Transactions on the XRPL are processed within seconds and at a fraction of a penny, making it an efficient and cost-effective platform for payments, outperforming Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Cardano (ADA).</p>
<p>A recent study <a href="https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/xrp/markets/BTC" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">conducted</a> by CryptoCompare revealed that XRPL is the fastest and most cost-effective blockchain network for payments.</p>
<p>The study found that XRPL transactions were processed in an average of just 3.3 seconds, with a transaction cost of only $0.00003. This represents a significant improvement compared to BTC, ETH, and ADA, which have average transaction times of 10 minutes, 15 seconds, and 20 seconds, respectively.</p>
<h2>XRP’S Scalability and Mechanism</h2>
<p>Furthermore, the study highlighted the scalability of XRPL compared to BTC, ETH, and ADA. While BTC, ETH, and ADA can only handle 7 transactions per second, 15 transactions per second, and 100 transactions per second, respectively, the XRPL can process up to 1,500 transactions per second.</p>
<p>Unlike BTC, which relies on energy-intensive proof-of-work consensus mechanisms, the XRPL utilizes a more environmentally friendly proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.</p>
<p>This not only contributes to its speed, cost-efficiency, and scalability but also makes <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/two-things-to-watch-for-in-ripple-xrp-price-this-week-volatility-ahead/" data-wpel-link="internal">XRPL</a> a more sustainable choice for businesses seeking fast and affordable payment solutions.</p>
<p>Overall, the attributes of the XRP Ledger position it as an attractive platform for payments, surpassing BTC, ETH, and ADA in terms of speed, cost-efficiency, and scalability, and it offers a more environmentally conscious alternative.</p>
<p>However, there&#8217;s also the other side of the argument &#8211; decentralization. Unlike Bitcoin&#8217;s distributed ledger, which relies on open-source technology developed and maintained by hundreds of independent developers and runs on tens of thousands of nodes across the world, XRP remains a largely centralized solution operated by a single entity &#8211; Ripple Labs.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Bitcoin is trying to make a move above $29K but has so far been unsuccessful, unlike a few altcoins. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin has been unable to make any forward progress in terms of price action throughout the past 24 hours, but it wasn&#8217;t for the lack of trying.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some altcoins are charting considerable increases over the same period.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price Can&#8217;t Push $30K</h2>
<p>Throughout the last 24 hours, Bitcoin bulls made an attempt to push the price toward the coveted $30K level.</p>
<p>They managed to get BTC all the way up to around $29,700, but that&#8217;s when bears intercepted the move, as it&#8217;s clearly visible in the following hourly chart.</p>
<figure id="attachment_266477" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-266477" style="width: 1333px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTCUSDT_2023-08-15_11-43-14.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-266477" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTCUSDT_2023-08-15_11-43-14.png" alt="BTCUSDT_2023-08-15_11-43-14" width="1333" height="858" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTCUSDT_2023-08-15_11-43-14.png 1333w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTCUSDT_2023-08-15_11-43-14-300x193.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTCUSDT_2023-08-15_11-43-14-1024x659.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTCUSDT_2023-08-15_11-43-14-768x494.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTCUSDT_2023-08-15_11-43-14-50x32.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1333px) 100vw, 1333px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-266477" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>They pushed the price back toward $29,400, where it&#8217;s currently trading, and Bitcoin ended the day completely flat, according to CoinGecko.</p>
<p>In any case, the presence of volatility, albeit low, is perceived as a refreshing mark in the industry, given how flat the market has been throughout the past month. It&#8217;s now interesting to see if the price will finally manage to escape its narrow range or if more of the same is incoming.</p>
<h2>Some Altcoins Soar, Others Stagnate</h2>
<p>The broader altcoin market has also been relatively calm throughout the past 24 hours, with certain exceptions, of course.</p>
<p>As seen in the heatmap below, most of the larger cryptocurrencies failed to chart any considerable increases and are trading close to flat on the day.</p>
<figure id="attachment_266479" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-266479" style="width: 1650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cryptocurrency_heatmap_1508231.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-266479" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cryptocurrency_heatmap_1508231.jpg" alt="cryptocurrency_heatmap_1508231" width="1650" height="1168" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cryptocurrency_heatmap_1508231.jpg 1650w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cryptocurrency_heatmap_1508231-300x212.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cryptocurrency_heatmap_1508231-1024x725.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cryptocurrency_heatmap_1508231-768x544.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cryptocurrency_heatmap_1508231-1536x1087.jpg 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cryptocurrency_heatmap_1508231-50x35.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1650px) 100vw, 1650px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-266479" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Quantify Crypto</figcaption></figure>
<p>However, there are a few cryptocurrencies that are pushing ahead of the herd considerably. First, FLEX Coin (FLEX) exploded by 16% throughout the past day and is undoubtedly the best performer for today.</p>
<p>THORChain (RUNE) is also up around 14%, but the cryptocurrency skyrocketed by almost 70% in the past week.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also Hedera&#8217;s HBAR token which is up over 10% on the day, also making it one of the best performers.</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum, there&#8217;s Kaspa. KAS is down 12% in the last 24 hours and is today&#8217;s worst-performing cryptocurrency.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Is a SHIB rally in the making? Voyager has sold out its entire SHIB stash, while lead developer is expected to come up with a major announcement today.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB) is an explosive cryptocurrency known for its sudden and unexpected rallies. Throughout the past seven days, it&#8217;s up 13.2%, making it one of the best-performing altcoins from the top 20 by means of total market capitalization.</p>
<p>However, there&#8217;s interesting data surfacing, indicating that SHIB&#8217;s price action has actually been compressed by tremendous selling coming from an institutional market participant.</p>
<h2>Is a SHIB Rally Incoming?</h2>
<p>Data from the popular on-chain analytics resource <em>Lookonchain </em><a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1691272802077429761" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">revealed</a> that Voyager has been selling a considerable number of SHIB tokens throughout the past 4 days.</p>
<p>The asset manager, which is currently going through a bankruptcy procedure, sold a whopping 1.4 <em>trillion </em>SHIB worth around $14.4 million.</p>
<p>This has likely suppressed the price from going higher. A couple of days ago, <em>CryptoPotato </em><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/voyager-reportedly-moved-5-5m-of-eth-and-shib-to-coinbase-amid-bankruptcy-procedures/" data-wpel-link="internal">reported</a> that Voyager moved $2.7 million worth of SHIB to Coinbase. It turns out that the reason was obvious.</p>
<p>The good news is that <em>Lookonchain </em>reported that Voyager has no more SHIB to sell. If the cryptocurrency continues its impressive performance from the past seven days, this might mean that more gains are in sight.</p>
<h2>Good News Coming?</h2>
<p>SHIB proponents are also expecting developments in its broader ecosystem. A few days ago, the lead developer Shytoshi Kusama <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/will-shiba-inus-leash-skyrocket-this-week-lead-developer-teases-big-updates-heres-when/" data-wpel-link="internal">teased</a> a new utility for its LEASH token.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Shiba Inu&#8217;s marketing strategist also pushed some updates, stating that later in the day, Kusama will be &#8220;giving a presentation that you won&#8217;t want to miss.&#8221;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that the recent developments have also <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/this-new-shiba-inu-whale-adds-48-million-worth-of-shib-ahead-of-developments/" data-wpel-link="internal">attracted</a> a brand new whale to the ecosystem. Someone bought a whopping $48 million worth of SHIB just a couple of days ago. Could they be waiting for something?</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[According to newly published documents, SBF used other FTX C-Suite members to bypass donation limits.
]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the 14th of August, the prosecution in SBF’s ongoing court case produced the longest and most explicit list of charges so far.</p>
<p>The document is 70 pages long and names legal precedents for most of the charges brought against him. However, special attention is given to the accusation of illegal political campaign contributions.</p>
<p>It wasn’t too long ago that Bankman-Fried was requesting the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sbf-to-enter-not-guilty-plea-to-campaign-financing-and-china-bribery-charges-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">dismissal</a> of the contribution charge, among others. Unfortunately for the defense, the document shows that the prosecution plans to revive the charges based on new evidence garnered during the discovery period.</p>
<h2>Things Sam Is Freaking Out About</h2>
<p>A highly important part of the prosecution’s strategy is the use of Caroline Ellison’s personal notes and archives, which include a list named “Things Sam Is Freaking Out About,” as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/14/technology/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-prosecutors.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">reported</a> by the New York Times.</p>
<p>These archives were virulently attacked by the defense, who labeled them as hearsay. However, the prosecution argues that Ellison’s notes are admissible evidence. In their opinion, the notes were not organized systematically due to any personal quirk. Instead, they were used to help keep track of the FTX C-suite’s off-the-books dealings, making her notes more akin to a secret ledger than a personal diary.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Ellison’s personal notes and to-do lists include entries such as a list titled “Things Sam is Freaking Out About,” which delineates Ellison’s understanding, from conversations with the defendant, of what remained the defendant’s top business concerns, such as Alameda’s trading hedges, bad press about the relationship between Alameda and FTX, and fundraising. […]</p>
<p>Keeping track of Alameda’s finances and objectives clearly constitutes a statement “designed to promote or facilitate achievement of the goals of [the] conspiracy.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Breach of Campaign Donation Law</h2>
<p>The 70-page document also outlines the prosecution’s intent to use text messages to and from members of FTX’s C-Suite as evidence of a breach of political campaign donation law.</p>
<p>This accusation primarily centers on using Nishad Singh and Ryan Salame to <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/elections-overview/biggest-donors" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">donate</a> funds to both sides of Congress on behalf of SBF.</p>
<p>Among the text messages cited as evidence is one sent by Salame to a relative of his, stating that SBF was donating to “weed out anti-crypto dems for pro-crypto dems and anti-crypto repubs for pro-crypto repubs” and stating that SBF would route money through him to erase that republican side.</p>
<p>However, Ryan Salame – who is facing his own set of <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/former-ftx-exec-under-investigation-for-possible-violations-of-campaign-finance-law-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">accusations</a> regarding violations of campaign finance law – will not be available as a witness in the case against Sam Bankman-Fried, choosing to plead the 5th amendment instead in a bid to not incriminate himself.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">From the US government&#8217;s motion in limine in the Sam Bankman-Fried criminal trial: &#8220;[Ryan] Salame is unavailable as a witness&#8230; Salame’s attorney has represented that if subpoenaed, Salame would invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.&#8221; <a href="https://t.co/NrB5d6PJDH" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/NrB5d6PJDH</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Over $24 million were donated by Ryan Salame to representatives of the Republican Party – and the accusations seem to indicate that none of it was out of his own pocket.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Ripple's XRP has been subjected to multiple discussions and its potential price targets during the next bull market are undoubtedly amongst the more exciting.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>XRP has been in the news lately after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed an interlocutory brief signaling its intention to appeal a recent ruling by Judge Analisa Torres.</p>
<p>The ruling found that XRP may not be <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-xrp-cto-david-schwartz-breaks-down-howey-test-following-sec-appeal/" data-wpel-link="internal">considered</a> a security when sold on the secondary market.</p>
<p>The SEC’s notice of appeal has <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-price-sinks-4-as-uncertainty-ramps-up-but-xrp20-nears-2-million-presale-raise/" data-wpel-link="internal">created</a> uncertainty among XRP investors, triggering a selling pressure that has shaved more than 10% off the coin’s price in the last 14 days.</p>
<p>However, as the crypto market slowly reshapes in readiness for the next bull run, can XRP overcome its current lethargy? And if it can, how high can it go? Well, we took it to no other than ChatGPT to get the answer.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/xrp_bull_market_cover.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266455" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/xrp_bull_market_cover.jpg" alt="xrp_bull_market_cover" width="1201" height="720" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/xrp_bull_market_cover.jpg 1201w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/xrp_bull_market_cover-300x180.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/xrp_bull_market_cover-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/xrp_bull_market_cover-768x460.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/xrp_bull_market_cover-50x30.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1201px) 100vw, 1201px" /></a></p>
<h2>XRP During the Next Bull Market</h2>
<p>While no crystal ball can predict with absolute certainty how XRP will do in the next bull run, certain factors will be central to any potential price rise the coin may make.</p>
<p>Market sentiment is an important price driver for crypto assets. A positive outlook may lead to increased interest and greater adoption, which should translate into higher prices in the market for XRP.</p>
<p>If the SEC were to fail in its appeal, as the pro-crypto lawyer John Deaton has so bullishly <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/pro-xrp-lawyer-willing-to-bet-big-on-ripple-v-sec-case-appeal/" data-wpel-link="internal">predicted</a>, one could expect a ripple effect of positive sentiment around the coin, which could boost its price significantly.</p>
<p>The overall condition of the broader crypto market will also play a part in determining the price of XRP. Most cryptocurrencies will ride the wave if the bull run is marketwide. For instance, many coins hit all-time highs during the last crypto bull run between mid-2020 and late 2021.</p>
<h2>What Else Will Determine the XRP Price?</h2>
<p>Furthermore, if the bull run coincided with XRP unveiling new technological advances or use cases, there’s little doubt it will reflect handsomely in its market price.</p>
<p>Regulatory clarity around crypto, particularly XRP, would also significantly boost its price. Recently, former SEC official John Reed Stark insinuated that a Republican victory in the forthcoming US presidential elections could lead to more crypto-friendly policies and greater regulatory clarity.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Will the SEC Approve Any Of The Recent Bitcoin Spot ETF Applications?</p>
<p>People often ask for my opinion on whether the SEC will approve any of the recent spate of bitcoin spot ETF applications, which is an interesting and important question.</p>
<p>My take is that the current SEC will… <a href="https://t.co/lPXebl03Y4" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/lPXebl03Y4</a></p>
<p>— John Reed Stark (@JohnReedStark) <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnReedStark/status/1690707913789112320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">August 13, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In the last bull run, XRP gained as much as 710% in 6 months, and if history repeats itself, it is not farfetched to imagine it could make similar gains as long as most of the factors explained above are in its favor. Going by its current price of $0.62, a 700% rise would hypothetically place XRP’s value at nearly $5. Of course, none of this is certain, as there are usually too many unknown variables that can affect a cryptocurrency’s price, and past performance is not an indicator of future performance.</p>
<p>Also, none of the above is to be construed as any form of financial advice. Remember that the cryptocurrency market is subjected to high volatility, and there&#8217;s a high chance of losing your investment. Never risk more than you&#8217;re comfortable losing, and always do your research or consult a professional before making an investment.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Bitcoin and the altcoins are still in a state of deep slumber as investor activity on-chain plunges to a new all-time low.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Aug. 14, on-chain analytics provider Glassnode published its weekly market update, but there wasn’t much to report.</p>
<p>Markets have hardly moved over the past week, and volatility is at record lows. The Bitcoin market has reached a stage of “extreme apathy and exhaustion,” it said before adding that <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-derivatives-volumes-drop-to-new-lows-amid-volatility-crush/" data-wpel-link="internal">volatility</a> and several key on-chain indicators are reaching all-time-low readings.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Sluggish Bitcoin Market Inflows</h2>
<p>Investors are reaching an all-time low in “willingness to spend coins on-chain,” the report noted.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The conditions of the Bitcoin market continue to resemble the bear market hangover seen in prior cycles, with an outsized wealth held by long-term high conviction holders.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The Realized Cap metric represents the cumulative capital inflow since inception. More than $16 billion in value has flowed into Bitcoin so far this year, but the growth is very shallow compared to previous cycles.</p>
<p>Moreover, the sluggish inflows could be compounded by the fact a large majority of the Bitcoin market is still underwater on their holdings, it said. This could create further resistance throughout the recovery.</p>
<p>It added that the supply held by long-term holders continues to increase, hitting a peak of 14.6 million BTC. Conversely, short-term holder supply has fallen to a multi-year low of 2.56 million BTC, it added.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Overall, this suggests that conviction of Bitcoin investors does remain impressively high, and very few are willing to liquidate their holdings.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, the fear and greed index, currently showing 53, has remained neutral for months now with no movement in either direction.</p>
<p>There are still a few dark clouds on the horizon that could keep crypto markets suppressed for a while.</p>
<p>The United States is still at war with the industry, and <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/two-things-to-watch-for-in-ripple-xrp-price-this-week-volatility-ahead/" data-wpel-link="internal">Ripple</a> could still lose its case. The specter of recession is still looming in America, which means less money to invest in high-risk assets.</p>
<h2>Crypto Market Outlook</h2>
<p>As evidenced by the on-chain analysis, crypto markets still haven’t moved this week. Total capitalization remains where it was five months ago at $1.2 trillion.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is trading flat at $29,350, while Ethereum remains stuck at $1,840 at the time of writing.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/this-indicator-signals-huge-move-ahead-for-btc-price-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">bright side</a>, crypto markets are still up 46% since the beginning of the year and have moved off the bear cycle bottom, so it&#8217;s not all doom and gloom.</p>
<p>Moreover, some analysts have <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/when-will-bitcoins-bull-run-start-analyst-chips-in/" data-wpel-link="internal">predicted</a> a new BTC all-time high around the halving in eight months’ time though that appears very unlikely at the moment.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase announced it has officially launched operations in Canada. As part of the initiative, the company introduced Coinbase One to local users &#8211; a 30-day trial offering zero trading fees and priority support.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The firm has been coping with severe regulatory issues in its homeland, with most problems coming from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). That dispute could be one reason why Coinbase has recently shifted its focus toward other countries.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8216;Our Vision Transcends Borders&#8217;</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite turning into one of the leading US-based crypto exchanges and becoming the first publicly-traded company of its kind, Coinbase </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbase-officially-launches-in-canada" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">disclosed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that its mission involves spreading abroad:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;While our journey towards transparency and compliance led us to becoming a publicly traded company in the United States, our vision transcends borders. Today, we proudly announce a pivotal milestone in our international expansion strategy – our official launch in Canada.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The team behind the platform explained that the expansion into the North American nation resulted from the comprehensive regulatory framework there and the local interest in innovation. Coinbase also outlined that Canadians are among the most intrigued in the crypto industry, with 30% planning to hop on the bandwagon soon.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Canadian users can now deposit and withdraw funds in CAD to and from their Coinbase wallets through Interac e-transfers. They are also allowed to onboard Coinbase One, which features zero trading fees, priority support, and enhanced staking rewards. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In addition, the company intends to enable withdrawals, seamless deposits, and high-value daily transaction limits later in 2023. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Unlike its regulatory problems at home, Coinbase praised its collaboration with the Canadian watchdogs, banking partners, and investors. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Recall that the US SEC </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/us-sec-files-a-lawsuit-against-coinbase-day-after-suing-binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">filed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> a lawsuit against the exchange in June this year, alleging it of violating several rules and offering trading services with unregistered securities, such as SOL, ADA, MATIC, and others.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Previous Efforts</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One of Coinbase&#8217;s recent expansions </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-officially-launches-platform-for-non-us-institutional-investors-in-bermuda-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">includes</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the launch of a platform in Bermuda that serves non-US institutional clients. The marketplace, which saw the light of day in May &#8211; allows users to trade bitcoin and ether perpetual futures and settle transactions in USDC. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;We would like to see the US take a similar approach instead of regulation by enforcement which has led to a disappointing trend for crypto development in the US,&#8221; the firm stated upon introducing the option.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Coinbase also </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-sees-uae-as-a-strategic-hub-for-international-operations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">eyed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the United Arab Emirates (UAE), highlighting the welcoming regulatory environment in the area. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;In short, the region is standing-out as a leader in the development of a web3 ecosystem, making it an attractive location to consider investing in. The vacuum created by other notable jurisdictions means that international counterparts, such as the UAE, are racing to fill the regulatory gap,&#8221; Nana Murugesan &#8211; VP of International and Business Development at Coinbase &#8211; said.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Subsequently, the company </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-ramps-up-efforts-to-expand-in-europe-partners-with-bitpanda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">partnered</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> with the Austrian crypto exchange Bitpanda at the end of May to strengthen its presence in Europe.</span></p>
