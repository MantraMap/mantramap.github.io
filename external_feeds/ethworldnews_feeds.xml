<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The Bahamian Securities Commission took control of the assets on November 12 due to concerns that FTX was vulnerable to cyberattacks.</li><li>Hackers stole nearly $400 million in digital assets hours after Founder Sam Bankman-Fried filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on November 11.</li><li>Notably, the tokens secured from FTX Digital Markets Ltd were worth $3.5 billion in November.</li></ul>



<p>Digital currencies belonging to FTX customers are held by the Securities Commission of the Bahamas, said a press statement published by the regulator on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Commission secured customer assets from FTX Digital Markets Ltd on November 12 following an exploit on the sunken crypto exchange a day before. An unknown hacker attacked the platform and stole nearly $400 million in crypto tokens. The FBI <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/u-s-doj-launches-probe-into-372-million-ftx-hack-following-bankruptcy-filing/">announced</a> investigations into the hack, per reports.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Founder Sam Bankman-Fried, Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, and Co-Founder Gary Wang were also <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/qai/2022/12/14/ftx-founder-and-ceo-sam-bankman-fried-arrested-in-the-bahamas/" rel="noopener">charged</a> with fraud and money laundering by the Department of Justice, CFTC, and SEC.</p>



<p>Notably, the $3.5 billion held by the Bahamian regulator was valued using November 12 market prices. Crypto Twitter participants also speculated that a piece of the holding could be in FTT and Serum (SRM) tokens. The Commission has not responded to questions about the specific tokens held.</p>



<p>Thursday’s announcement also addressed claims that the Bahamas regulator told Bankman-Fried’s to open local withdrawals, denying such a request.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>FTX Customer Assets Await Court Order</h2>



<p>The Bahamian Securities Commission said the assets will remain under custody until a Supreme Court issues an order. Per the official statement, the SCB will hold the assets in “digital wallets controlled by the Commission, for safekeeping”. The current market value of the tokens held by the watchdog is unclear at press time. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The digital assets transferred on 12 November 2022 to digital wallets under the exclusive control the Commission are being held by the Commission on a temporary basis, until such time as The Bahamas Supreme Court directs the Commission to deliver them to the customers and creditors who own them, or to the JPLs to be administered under rules governing the insolvency estate for the benefit of the customers and creditors of FTXDM</p></blockquote>



<p>Customers in Turkey and Japan could be the first to access their cryptocurrencies from the bankruptcy exchange. Per reports, Liquid announced a plan to return customer assets by mid-February 2023. Disgraced crypto tycoon Sam Bankman-Fried bought Liquid crypto exchange after the Japanese crypto exchange was hacked for $100 million.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>The Department of Justice charged Eisenberg with market manipulation of the MNGO token.</li><li>Eisenberg exploited Mango Markets for $110 million in cryptocurrencies back in October 2022.</li><li>The Solana-based decentralized exchange offered Eisenberg and the other hackers $47 million as a bug bounty if the group returned $67 million in digital assets.</li></ul>



<p>Avraham Eisenberg was arrested on Tuesday after the U.S. Department of Justice charged Eisenberg with market manipulation over an October hack on the decentralized exchange Mango Markets. The platform allows users on Solana to buy, sell, lend and trade cryptocurrencies on Solana’s blockchain network.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) comprised of MNGO token holders govern the exchange.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>The Charges</h2>



<p>Indeed, the DOJ charged and arrested Eisenberg for “market manipulation offenses”, per an official statement from U.S. prosecutors on Tuesday. Eisenberg also stands accused of commodities fraud and commodities manipulation, as revealed by a second filing.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Eisenberg engaged in a scheme involving the intentional and artificial manipulation of the price of perpetual futures contracts on a cryptocurrency exchange called Mango Markets.</p></blockquote>



<h2>Mango Markets $110 Million Hack</h2>



<p>Mango Markets was exploited for around $110 million in cryptocurrencies on October 11, 2022. The hacker leveraged a loophole in Mango’s price oracle to trigger massive withdrawals from the DEX.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On October 15, 2022, Eisenberg said he “was involved with a team that operated a highly profitable trading strategy” on Mango. The DOJ’s indictment said Eisenberg and his team generated illicit wealth by trading MNGO perpetual tokens between several counts.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Statement on recent events:<br><br>I was involved with a team that operated a highly profitable trading strategy last week.</p>&mdash; Avraham Eisenberg (@avi_eisen) <a href="https://twitter.com/avi_eisen/status/1581326197241180160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">October 15, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>According to the court filing, the hacker group then manipulated Mango’s token price and created an artificial asset price pump by purchasing MNGO in vast amounts. Eisenberg allegedly leveraged the assets as collateral to borrow a myriad of digital currencies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Afterward, Eisenberg drained liquidity from the DEX and withdrew $110 million in several cryptos. The trader claimed the process aligned with “legal open market actions” and the exploit was the consequence of Mango Markets’ lack of anticipation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mango offered Eisenberg and his team $47 million as a bug bounty. In exchange, the platform asked the hackers to return $67 million in tokens.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The controversial FTX hack last month, which led to a loss of more than $370 million, has once again been brought into the limelight. The United States Department of Justice has launched a criminal probe into this matter. According to a report by&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-27/us-probes-how-372-million-vanished-in-hack-after-ftx-bankruptcy" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, this probe is separate from the fraud case that former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is currently facing in Manhattan.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Funds exploited from FTX have been frozen by authorities</strong></h2>



<p>The investigation into the hack is being headed by the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team of the Department of Justice. This team consists of a network of prosecutors who specialize in digital asset investigation. A person familiar with the matter has revealed that a portion of the exploited funds has been frozen by authorities. This investigation is separate from the fraud charges that have been brought against&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftxs-sam-bankman-fried-to-be-released-after-posting-250-million-bail/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>. The former CEO had previously indicated that the exploit may have been an inside job.</p>



<p>The hack was initially&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/0xfoobar/status/1591261359152705538" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reported</a>&nbsp;by the crypto Twitter community.

The initial figure was close to $650 million since FTX employees had started transferring assets into cold wallets as a&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/_Ryne_Miller/status/1591326796305530880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1591326796305530880%7Ctwgr%5E5804e9a63837a114a4351ef76deb5e6f21c40948%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fftx-reportedly-hacked-as-officials-flag-abnormal-wallet-activity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">precaution</a>. </p>

<p>The exploit was later acknowledged by current CEO John Ray III who stated that there had been “unauthorized access” within hours of filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy on 11 November.&nbsp;&nbsp;The days following the hack saw the perpetrator swapping the exploited tokens for ETH. These funds were then bridged to Bitcoin using the RenBridge service. The perpetrator also employed mixer services to obscure the money trail.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>Bankman-Fried affirmed that 56 million Robinhood shares were bought with loans from Alameda Research between April and May 2022.</li><li>The loans were issued in several amounts to Sam and his co-founder Gary Wang, per a court affidavit.</li><li>FTX lawyers asked a judge to freeze the assets after BlockFi claimed ownership of SBF&#8217;s stake in Robinhood.</li></ul>



<p>Disgraced crypto tycoon Sam Bankman-Fried told an Antiguan court that loans from Alameda Research were used to acquire a 7.6% stake in stock broker and crypto exchange Robinhood. Bankman-Fried affirmed the source of capital for his Robinhood stock scoop in a court affidavit shortly before his arrest in December.</p>



<p>As previously reported, troubled crypto lender BlockFi filed for ownership of Sam’s Robinhood. Lawyers for the bankrupt exchange asked a judge to <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-blockfi-tussle-sbfs-robinhood-stock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">freeze</a> the assets for the benefit of creditors, debtors, and claimants. </p>



<p>According to the affidavit, SBF acquired the shares along with FTX and Alameda co-founder Gary Wang. The pair domiciled Emergent Fidelity Technologies in Antigua to manage the investment in Robinhood. Bankman-Fried controlled 90% of Emergent while Gary assumed 10% control of the company, per court filing.</p>



<p>Gary and SBF then bootstrapped Emergent with loans from Alameda, securing tens of millions in loans. Alameda issued four promissory notes lending roughly $491 million to Bankman-Fried and $54 million to Gary, said SBF. Bankman-Fried added that extra capital to complete the massive $600 million purchase was probably also borrowed by the pair.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>In order to capitalize Emergent so that it could make the investment into Robinhood, Gary and I agreed to borrow funds from Alameda Research Ltd. Those funds were capitalized into Emergent and it used those funds to acquire the shares in Robinhood.</p></blockquote>



<h2>FTX Customer Funds Stolen?</h2>



<p>The affidavit supposedly confirmed allegations from the CFTC and SEC that Alameda issued loans to individual and top executives within Bankman-Fried’s sunken crypto empire. Also, the CFTC’s complaint alleged that Alameda siphoned customer funds from FTX before the trading giant edged insolvency in May 2022.</p>



<p>Indeed, the filing from the U.S. regulator and SBF’s affidavit echoed concerns that the 56 million Robinhood shares were bought with stolen customer funds from FTX.  Individual creditor Yonatan Ben Shimon argued a similar claim to the Antiguan court. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8230;Emergent acquired a 7/6% shareholding in Robinhood for about US$650 million possibly using funds improperly diverted from those invested by me and others with FTX. I know nothing regarding the source of the funds used to acquire the 7/6% interest in Robinhood beyond the fact that it was allegedly “working capital”.</p><cite>&#8211; Yonatan Ben Shimon, indivudal creditor.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Bankman-Fried refuted allegations of criminal negligence prior to his arrest in the Bahamas and extradition to the United States. However, Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2022/12/23/caroline-ellison-admits-she-and-bankman-fried-conspired-to-steal-from-ftx-customers-and-mislead-investors-reports-say/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">testified</a> to diverting user funds from SBF’s crypto exchange to his trading giant in a plea deal. </p>

<ul><li>Fantom co-founder Andre Cronje has laid out the protocol’s roadmap for 2023.</li><li>The protocol will focus on expanding its dApp ecosystem through gas monetization and subsidies.&nbsp;</li><li>Cronje has been appointed to the Board of Directors for Fantom Foundation Ltd.</li><li>The protocol previously pledged to bring down its token burn rate to incentivize dApp developers.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><a target="_blank" href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/fantom-up-20-andre-cronje-return/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Andre Cronje</a>, the popular DeFi architect who co-founded the Fantom Foundation, has laid out the 2023 roadmap for the layer 1 blockchain. Cronje, who refers to himself as the “Vice President of Memes” at Fantom Foundation, has stated that the foundation will focus on the expansion of its decentralized application (dApp) ecosystem next year.</p>



<h2><strong>Fantom to incentivize builders with gas monetization and subsidies</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://andrecronje.medium.com/letter-to-fantom-foundation-team-eb3d870c6be8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">letter</a> from Cronje to the foundation team, the objective for next year is to provide the highest throughput blockchain available in order to create a single, secure settlement layer for all decentralized activity. This goal is to be achieved by improving the tools, integration, and ease of use for developers, rather than catering to specific user verticals like DeFi, NFT, gameFi, and exchanges.</p>



<p>Cronje has outlined several core focus areas for the next 12 months. These include gas monetization, which will allow dApps to share revenue based on the gas used in transactions, similar to how YouTube and Twitch creators earn income. The foundation also plans to implement gas subsidies, which will allow dApps to interact without requiring users to pay gas fees themselves, making onboarding easier and more seamless.</p>



<p>Another key focus for the Fantom Foundation is account abstraction, which will eliminate the distinction between contract and EOA accounts. Under this system, contracts will be able to initiate transactions and pay for gas, and EOAs will simply serve as authorities authorized to instruct wallets to take certain actions. This will allow for a more user-friendly dApp experience and enable social recovery options such as email and password authentication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An economic abstraction for gas fees is also in the pipeline, which will allow fees to be paid in tokens other than FTM, and is developing a new middleware layer to improve smart contract processing and unlock the full potential of hardware. Other focus areas include performance engineering, documentation and training, and business development.</p>



<p>Andre Cronje also informed the team that he has formally been appointed as a member of the Board of Directors for both Fantom Foundation Ltd and Fantom Operations Ltd.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Caroline Ellison, the former CEO of Sam Bankman-Fried’s quantitative trading firm Alameda Research, made sensational claims during her plea hearing on 19 December. A transcript of the said hearing was unsealed earlier today. According to a report by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/alamedas-ex-ceo-tells-judge-she-hid-billions-loans-ftx-execs-2022-12-23/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reuters</a>, Ellison has confessed that FTX executives including former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, received secret loans worth billions of dollars from Alameda.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Caroline Ellison prepared fake balance sheets to mislead investors</strong></h2>



<p>The former Alameda chief revealed that the trading firm could borrow unlimited funds from the now-bankrupt crypto exchange FTX. The transcript further revealed that Ellison and Bankman-Fried conspired to hide this crucial information from FTX’s investors, customers, and creditors.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We prepared certain quarterly balance sheets that concealed the extent of Alameda&#8217;s borrowing and the billions of dollars in loans that Alameda had made to FTX executives and to related parties,&#8221; </p><cite>Ellison told U.S. District Judge Ronnie Abrams.</cite></blockquote>



<p>The United States Department of Justice put out a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/united-states-attorney-announces-extradition-ftx-founder-samuel-bankman-fried-united" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release</a>&nbsp;yesterday which revealed that Caroline Ellison had reached a plea deal and will be cooperating with prosecutors in the investigation. FTX co-founder Gary Wang also pleaded guilty and secured a similar deal with the prosecutors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wang revealed during his plea hearing, which was also held on 19 December, that he was directed to alter FTX’s code to give Alameda exclusive access to the exchange. At the time, investors and customers of the exchange were being told that Alameda had no such privileges. Wang did not name the people who issued these directions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both Ellison and Wang will likely be called upon to testify against former associate Sam Bankman-Fried whose next hearing is scheduled for 3 January 2023. SBF was&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftxs-sam-bankman-fried-to-be-released-after-posting-250-million-bail/" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a>&nbsp;into the custody of his parents in Palo Alto, California yesterday after he posted a bail bond of $250 million.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>FTX was hacked for hundreds of millions in cryptocurrencies a few hours after filing for bankruptcy.</li><li>Paxos quickly froze 11,184 Paxos Gold (PAXG) tokens stolen from the crypto exchange following a request from  U.S. Federal authorities</li><li>The on-chain trust firm recovered roughly $20 million after tracking the assets to four Ethereum addresses. </li></ul>



<p>Paxos rescued $20 million in digital gold stolen from Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto exchange FTX, per The Block.</p>



<h2>11,184 PAXG Stolen From FTX</h2>



<p>An unknown hacker stole 11,184 PAXG tokens backed by real gold in Paxos’ custody from FTX shortly after the crypto exchange declared bankruptcy on November 11, 2022. Reports said the hacker drained over $400 million in other crypto assets like DAI and Ether (ETH) from the platform. </p>



<p>Paxos is a regulated crypto trust and blockchain company. The firm is also the issuer of Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin. After the hack, Paxos <a href="https://paxos.com/2022/11/12/paxos-freezes-paxg-tokens-related-to-ftx/" rel="nofollow noopener">tracked</a> the PAXG tokens to four Ethereum addresses and froze the assets in compliance with a request from U.S. Federal Law Enforcement.</p>



<p>Notably, the hacker swapped around $300 million in virtual currencies in ETH, becoming of the largest Ether holders. Ethereum&#8217;s community grew concerned that the attacker might tank ETH&#8217;s price in a bid to launder crypto.</p>



<p>The team reportedly “reclaimed the assets” and transferred $20 million in PAXG tokens from the “FTX Accounts Drainer” wallets to a null address. Paxos’s treasury burned the tokens and minted 11,184 new PAXG tokens into a separate crypto wallet.</p>

</div></figure>



<h2>FTX Users In Limbo&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Billions in assets from Sam Bankman-Fried’s flatlined exchange remain unaccounted for. The November hacker <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-hacker-becomes-35th-largest-holder-of-ethereum-after-panic-purchasing-approx-50m-of-eth/">stole</a> over $400 million in cryptocurrencies and digital assets. The CFTC, SEC, and Federal prosecutors allege $4 billion from customer funds were diverted to Alameda Research, under Bankman-Fried’s instructions.</p>



<p>SBF’s trading giant also hid $8 billion in liabilities on the crypto exchange, per reports. Court filing revealed tens of millions in personal loans to company executives including Bankman-Fried himself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company recovered roughly $1 billion in crypto assets and cash equivalents, according to Bankruptcy CEO John Ray III as he testified before Congress in Washington DC. Ray also remarked recovering assets was a slow process due to a lack of proper accounting in SBF’s crypto empire.</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>BlockFi and FTX are in contention over 56 million shares in trading giant Robinhood.</li><li>The shares are currently controlled by Emergent Fidelity Technologies, a company owned almost entirely by fallen crypto billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried.</li><li>BlockFi argued ownership of the Robinhood stock as part of a deal with Bankman-Fried but FTX pushed for the assets to stay frozen.</li></ul>



<p>FTX filed a motion in a bid to freeze around $450 million in Robinhood shares as bankruptcy creditors battle over control for Sam Bankman-Fried’s massive investment in the trading giant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The assets in question are some 56 million shares in equity and crypto trading platform Robinhood. Bankman-Fried <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/robinhoods-stocks-soar-20-after-sam-bankman-fried-confirms-his-stake-in-the-company/">bought</a> his stake in Robinhood for $600 million back in May 2022. According to the court filing, the shares are currently owned by Emergent Fidelity Technologies. Notably, SBF owns 90% of the company and controlled its operations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>BlockFi Sues For Robinhood Stock</p>



<p>BlockFi <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/blockfi-ftx-ceo-over-robinhood-shares/">sued</a> the fallen exchange Founder over his Robinhood shares. The bankrupt crypto broker claimed that Bankman-Fried pledged his 56 million shares as part of a deal. BlockFi also claimed the agreement was reached FTX declared bankruptcy on November 11.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other claimants of SBF’s Robinhood stock include Yonathan Ben Shimon (creditor), and Sam Bankman-Fried himself, per the court filing.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>FTX Ask Judge To Freeze SBF’s Robinhood Stock</h2>



<p>The bankrupt crypto exchange <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.deb.188450/gov.uscourts.deb.188450.291.0.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">responded</a> to BlockFi and other claimants by asking the judge to freeze Bankman-Fried’s shares in Robinhood. Instead, lawyers representing the disgraced exchange argued to maintain the asset freeze until the bankruptcy court deliberate on the best resolution for all parties.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The fact that multiple prepetition creditors of different Debtors and Mr. Bankman-Fried are all seeking to obtain possession of the Robinhood Shares demonstrates that the asset should be frozen until this Court can resolve the issues in a manner that is fair to all creditors of the Debtors.</p></blockquote>



<p>BlockFi’s complaint is one of several against SBF’s shattered crypto empire. Court filing revealed at least $3 billion owed to the top 50 creditors. Over 1 million creditors also failed claims.&nbsp;The bankruptcy court <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-creditors-committee-wintermutre/">chose</a> crypto market maker Wintermute and Genesis entity GGC International as part of the Unsecured Creditors Committee.</p>

<ul><li>Sam Bankman-Fried will be released on a whopping $250 million pre-trial bail.&nbsp;</li><li>The former FTX CEO will move in with his parents in California.&nbsp;</li><li>Alameda Chief Caroline Ellison has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with law enforcement.&nbsp;</li><li>SBF previously claimed that he was down to his last $100,000.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried, the former chief of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, is set to walk free following his&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-approved-extradition/" rel="noreferrer noopener">extradition</a>&nbsp;to the United States. A federal magistrate judge in New York has ruled that the disgraced CEO is to be released on a $250 million bail designed by federal prosecutors and SBF’s attorneys. Nicholas Roos, the prosecutor, in this case, has described it as the “largest pre-trial bond ever”.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Sam Bankman-Fried released into the custody of his parents</strong></h2>



<p>Per a report by&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/ftx-founder-bankman-fried-make-us-court-appearance-after-extradition-2022-12-22/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reuters</a>, Judge Gabriel Gorenstein has set strict terms for the release. SBF will be released into the custody of his parents, who are reportedly putting up the equity in their home to partially satisfy the bail conditions. Additionally, he will also be required to surrender his passport and undergo regular mental health treatment and evaluation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Users on Twitter were infuriated with the judge’s ruling. Despite his parents putting up the equity in their $25 million California house, the general sentiment was that Sam Bankman-Fried would use customer funds to fund his bail. The former FTX CEO had previously stated that he was down to his last $100,000.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Caroline Ellison joins hands with prosecutors</strong></h2>



<p>Caroline Ellison, the former Chief Executive of SBF’s quantitative trading firm Alameda Research, has secured a plea deal with the prosecutors. According to a press release put out by the U.S. Department of Justice, Ellison, along with FTX co-founder Gary Wang, plead guilty to the fraud charges brought by the DOJ.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to an unsealed&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23495436/crypto-cooperator-ftx-alamedas-caroline-ellisons-plea-agreement-inner-city-press-on-the-case.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">plea agreement</a>&nbsp;with the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Ellison will have to post a $250,000 personal recognizance bond. Terms of the agreement also include the clearing of any charges against Caroline Ellison except criminal tax violations, provided she fully cooperates with the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s office.&nbsp;</p>
