<li>Litecoin started a downside correction from the $95 zone against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>LTC price is now trading below $90 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $85 on the 4-hours chart of the LTC/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair remains supported for a fresh increase unless there is a clear move below $80.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Litecoin price is correcting gains from $95 against the US Dollar, similar to bitcoin. LTC price could resume its increase if it remains well supported above the $80 level.</em></p>
<h2>Litecoin Price Analysis</h2>
<p>In the past few days, there was a decent increase in <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-eyes-another-increase-to-30k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a>, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-eth-aims-fresh-increase-above-1850/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Ethereum</a>, Ripple, and Litecoin against the US Dollar. Earlier, LTC formed a base above the $80 level and started a fresh increase.</p>
<p>There was a clear move above the $85 and $90 resistance levels. The price even climbed above the $92 level and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours). However, the bears were active near the $95 zone. A high was formed near $95.00 and the price started a downside correction.</p>
<p>There was a move below the $90 level. The price traded below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $75.32 swing low to the $95.00 high. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $85 on the 4-hours chart of the LTC/USD pair.</p>
<p>It is now trading below $90 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours). On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $85 level.</p>
<p>The next major resistance sits near the $90 level. A clear move above the $90 level could pump the price toward the $95 level. Any more gains might call for a test of $100. Immediate support is near the $82.80 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $75.32 swing low to the $95.00 high.</p>
<p>The next major support is near the $80 zone. A downside break below the $80 support might start a strong decline.</p>

<p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/LTCUSD/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="exclude">chart</a>, Litecoin price is trading below $90 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours). Overall, the price remains supported for a fresh increase unless there is a clear move below $80.</p>
<h2>Technical indicators</h2>
<p>4 hours MACD – The MACD for LTC/USD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone.</p>
<p>4 hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for LTC/USD is now below the 50 level.</p>
<p>Key Support Levels – $82.80 and $80.00</p>
<p>Key Resistance Levels – $85 and $90.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) has joined hands with Global Futures and Options (GFO-X) to give the U.K. access to <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-ca/money/topstories/lseg-teams-with-digital-trading-platform-to-offer-bitcoin-futures-and-options/ar-AA19PDKk" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">regulated trading and clearing</a> in both bitcoin index futures and options.</p>
<h2>The U.K. is Changing Its Attitude Towards Crypto</h2>
<p>The U.K. has had a very up-and-down history with bitcoin and digital currencies. Not long ago, the country’s financial watchdog (known as the FCA) <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/fca-rules-all-crypto-atms-in-the-uk-are-operating-illegally/" data-wpel-link="internal">announced that</a> all bitcoin ATMs would be banned from the region. The agency cited the use of bitcoin ATMs in fraud as the reason for the ban, suggesting investors could not be protected if they continued to utilize these machines.</p>
<p>But the U.K. is beginning to change its attitude towards the world of digital assets, recently voicing its desire to serve as a major bitcoin and blockchain hub of the world. This attitude stems from the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/01/what-rishi-sunak-as-pm-means-for-the-uk-crypto-industry.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">country’s new prime minister</a>, who has stated he would like the U.K. to serve as the next big center for crypto-based innovation.</p>
<p>In addition, the nation has <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-united-kingdom-announces-plans-for-new-crypto-regulations/" data-wpel-link="internal">become one of the first to instill major</a> digital asset regulation, citing the November 2022 <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/" data-wpel-link="internal">fall of FTX</a> as the reason why. The United Kingdom doesn’t want another instance like that, and it’s looking to ensure all crypto traders residing on the island remain safe and sound while trading virtual assets.</p>
<p>In addition to regulated trading and futures, the LSEG is also planning the release of a separate product dubbed Digital Asset Clear, which will enable cash-settled, dollar-denominated digital asset trading on the GFO-X. Once European Union officials give the greenlight on these services, they’re likely to become available during the fourth quarter of this year. GFO-X explained in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>GFO-X is taking the first steps to extracting efficiencies from new technologies within a traditional market structure, with the goal over time of delivering 24/7 trading to global regulated digital asset markets.</p></blockquote>
<p>Products like this are nothing new given organizations like <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/cme-group/" data-wpel-link="internal">the CME Group</a> in Chicago have been offering bitcoin futures trading for some time, but it’s nice to know the breadth is expanding and that further organizations are beginning to see the light when it comes to futures options. This will only allow the digital currency arena to grow and become more mainstream and legitimate.</p>
<p>Arnab Sen – chief executive and co-founder of GFO-X – commented in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>Recent market events in the trading of digital assets have highlighted the need for a safe, regulated venue where large financial institutions can trade at scale while keeping their clients’ assets protected.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Working Towards the Greater Good</h2>
<p>Frank Soussan – head of Digital Asset Clear – also threw his two cents into the mix with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p data-t="{&quot;n&quot;:&quot;blueLinks&quot;}">We look forward to working with GFO-X and market participants alike to build a liquid, regulated marketplace for these products and contributing to its safe growth and development.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin has been doing quite well as of late. The currency <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-rose-to-30k-in-mid-april-analysts-discuss-why/" data-wpel-link="internal">just hit $30K for</a> the first time in about 11 months, and everyone is on pins and needles about where the world’s number one digital currency will do next.</p>
<h2>The Bitcoin Price Hikes Are Leading to More Hodling</h2>
<p>The asset is doing so well, in fact, that hodling has <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/bitcoin-hoarding-in-personal-wallets-signals-support-after-jump-to-30-000-bofa-says/ar-AA19Ko6p" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">become much more prominent</a> in recent weeks. Initially written out to be “holding,” the term was misspelled online as “hodling” and it’s been utilized ever since when talking about holding the asset in one’s wallet and refusing to sell it, no matter what the market conditions may be.</p>
<p>In a new report issued by Bank of America, it appears the practice of “hodling” is getting to be more common. Prior, many people were in the process of selling their digital assets given how poorly 2022 went. It was an embarrassment and a disgrace to see currencies like bitcoin lose more than 70 percent of their value (the asset fell from an all-time high of about $68,000 to the mid-$16K range), and there didn’t seem to be much sense in holding these currencies given how weak the prospects were.</p>
<p>But now, it looks like things are changing. The B of A report says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Investors transfer tokens from exchange wallets to their personal wallets when they intend to hold them (or HODL), indicating a potential decrease in sell pressure.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s become clear that many more investors are gaining their trust of the digital currency world back. They are confident that things can return to normal, and that these assets still have a lot to offer regardless of last year’s pathetic results. Hong Fang – president of the digital currency exchange OKX – said in a recent interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin is becoming a very clear safe haven for a lot of the issues we’re having right now.</p></blockquote>
<p>He was commenting on the fact that the Federal Reserve made it known that <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/federal-reserve-hikes-rates-again-what-will-happen-to-btc/" data-wpel-link="internal">2023 will not be a year</a> in which interest rate hikes stop, like so many analysts originally thought. In fact, Fed Chair Jerome Powell recently came out and said that inflation is still a problem in nations like the U.S., and he and his associates will do all they can to fight it (this includes pushing rates up even further).</p>
<h2>Staying Strong Regardless of the News</h2>
<p>Despite all this, it seems as though bitcoin is developing a thicker skin, and negative news is no longer hurting it the way it did last year. Nathan Batchelor – managing partner at analytics platform Biyond Trader – said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin has stopped reacting to bad news. This is a tell-tale sign of a strong buyers’ market.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the meantime, other assets are also pumping fast. Ethereum, for example, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-ethereum-shapella-upgrade-occurred-now-what/" data-wpel-link="internal">recently endured its</a> Shapella upgrade and rose to about $1,900 per unit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The bitcoin price is getting a lot of hype as of late given that it <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-rose-to-30k-in-mid-april-analysts-discuss-why/" data-wpel-link="internal">recently hit $30K for</a> the first time in about 11 months. The news is no doubt good, but Ethereum is also doing quite well and hogging up the spotlight <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-ethereum-shapella-upgrade-occurred-now-what/" data-wpel-link="internal">considering it just went</a> through its Shapella upgrade, and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/04/14/next-bull-rull-ethereum-founder-issues-bullish-prediction-after-game-changing-upgrade-helps-bitcoin-price-rally/?sh=25f743a0497f" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">now the co-founder</a> of ETH Vitalik Buterin is confident another bull run is on its way.</p>
<h2>Vitalik Buterin Has Big Plans for Ethereum</h2>
<p>However, he’s adamant that crypto scaling issues need to be fixed before it arrives or else the bull run is likely to suffer. In a recent interview, Buterin commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>If we dont fix scaling before the next bull run, people are going to be stuck paying $500 transaction fees.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s unclear if he’s planning for this to be part of the next big upgrade, which hasn’t officially been announced yet. Thus far, the currency has endured two major upgrades over the course of eight months. The first took place in September and was known as <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/merge/" data-wpel-link="internal">The Merge</a>. It was a situation where the proof of work module that Ethereum relied on came to an end, and the currency moved to proof of stake.</p>
<p>This allowed the asset to become eco-friendlier in that it used far less energy, transactions became less expensive, and the network moved much quicker. With this new Shapella upgrade, the currency units that’ve been staked all this time are suddenly available for withdrawal. Buterin continued his discussion by stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Shapella upgrade closes the loop on some things that are part of the PoS [proof of stake] transition but did not make it in time for The Merge, withdrawals obviously being really important. The immediate next focus after this… is going to be scaling.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Could Bigger Investors Get Involved?</h2>
<p>The Shapella upgrade is getting a lot of attention from outside parties, and some analysts are confident the recent price surges Ethereum has endured as a result could wind up attracting the attention of Wall Street and institutional investors. Mona El Isa, the chief executive of crypto firm Avantgarde Finance, said in a recent statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>The highly anticipated Ethereum Shanghai upgrade is potentially game-changing and could be the catalyst towards digital assets becoming mainstream in the majority of funds… This newfound liquidity will be seen as a move to de-risking digital asset allocations by institutional investors, who have previously been put off by Ethereum’s old version that locked money in. With the removal of a major barrier, we would expect to see a rapid move towards investors staking Ethereum, which could prove bullish for the price of the asset long-term.</p></blockquote>
<p>At the time of writing, Ethereum – the world’s second largest digital currency by market cap and the number one competitor to bitcoin – has shot into the $1,900 range.</p>

<p><em>TRON price started a fresh increase above $0.0750 against the US Dollar, outpacing <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-eyes-another-increase-to-30k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a>. TRX’s price could rise further if it clears the $0.0795 resistance.</em></p>
<h2>Tron Price Analysis</h2>
<p>In the past few sessions, Tron price started a decent increase from the $0.0710 support zone against the US Dollar. TRX’s price remained well-bid and was able to climb above the $0.0750 zone.</p>
<p>It traded above the $0.0765 and $0.0782 levels to move further into a positive zone. However, the bears were active below the $0.080 level. A high is formed near $0.0798 and the price is now consolidating gains. It is trading above $0.0765 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tron-trx-price-analysis-more-gains-possible-above-0-072/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>.</p>
<p>On the upside, TRX is facing resistance near the $0.0795 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.080 level. A close above $0.080 could send the price toward the $0.0825 resistance zone.</p>
<p>Any more gains might send TRX price toward $0.085, above which the price could even rise toward $0.088. On the downside, initial support is near the $0.0768 level or the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.0668 swing low to the $0.0798 high.</p>
<p>There is also a major bullish trend line forming with support near $0.0642 on the 4-hours chart. The next major support is now forming near $0.0732 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.0668 swing low to the $0.0798 high.</p>
<p>If there is a downside break below the $0.0732 support, the price might revisit the $0.0710 support. Any more losses might call for a move toward the $0.0700 zone in the near term.</p>

<li>The price is now trading near $27,100 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $27,100 on the 4-hour chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $27,480 resistance zone.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Bitcoin price is rising from $26,550 against the US Dollar. BTC might eye another increase if the bulls remain active above the $26,650 zone.</em></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price Analysis</h2>
<p>Bitcoin price <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-faces-uphill-task-near-27250/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">remained well-bid</a> above the $26,000 level. A base was formed and the price was able to settle above the $26,500 resistance zone. The bulls remained active above $26,500 and initiated a decent increase.</p>
<p>There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the key decline from the $29,851 swing high to the $25,811 low. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $27,100 on the 4-hour chart of the BTC/USD pair.</p>
<p>Bitcoin price is now trading near $27,100 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-turns-red-below-29k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $27,480 level.</p>
<p>The next major resistance might be near the $27,840 zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the key decline from the $29,851 swing high to the $25,811 low. A clear move above the $27,480 and $27,850 resistance levels might send the price toward $28,500.</p>
<p>Any more gains might push the price toward the $29,500 zone. If there is no upside break, the price might start a fresh decline below the $27,100 level and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</p>
<p>The first major support is near $27,000. The next key support is near the $26,500 level, below which the price might accelerate lower. In the stated case, the price could decline toward the $26,000 level in the coming sessions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Calgary, Canada is setting <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/canada/calgary-police-service-to-host-western-canada-cryptocurrency-investigation-hub/ar-AA19MZ2y" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">up a new training and investigations</a> hub hosted by local police authorities. The purpose is to deal with rising crypto crime that residents have reported. The goal is to keep crime numbers down and make sure people know how to avoid digital scams in the future.</p>
<h2>Calgary Gets Serious About Crypto-Related Crime</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/crypto-scams/" data-wpel-link="internal">Crypto scams</a> are nothing new, but they appear to have grown in both size and strength over the past few years. Calgary wants to make sure people are aware of the many red flags that are often made apparent with so many faulty (or fake) crypto investing programs.</p>
<p>The Calgary Police Service (CPS) is now partnering with blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis to ensure proper software, data, and research options are available to members of the Western Canada Cryptocurrency Investigations Center to ensure the program is successful in training citizens on what to avoid and what to do. CPS Chief Mark Neufeld said in a recent interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>If [the] same person clicks on the wrong link on an email and has thousands of dollars stolen from them, we need to be able to move heaven and earth in the very same way and release those same hounds in the digital world so that we can get that money back.</p></blockquote>
<p>He’s confident in the relationship his organization has formed with Chainalysis and believes his associates will be able to get the information they need to tackle more crypto-related investigations. He mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cyber is quickly becoming a component of criminal activity, and [it] often requires collaboration between law enforcement and other expert industries. We are thrilled to be part of an innovative partnership with Chainalysis where cybersecurity expertise is shared among the Calgary Police Service and private enterprise[s].</p></blockquote>
<p>In 2022, it was estimated that residents of Calgary lost close to $14 million in crypto funds due to thievery and scams. In 2023, just five months in, the number is a reported $3 million. Neufeld says these numbers are inaccurate and likely much larger given how much crypto crime goes unreported due to the technicality behind it. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think once people understand that the Calgary Police Service is committed to keeping businesses and individuals safe in that space, I think you will see people coming forward, and that’s good. The more people that come forward, the better we can understand those trends and what’s happening there and respond to it.</p></blockquote>
<h2>All the Transactions Can Be Seen</h2>
<p>Gurvais Grigg – public safety chief technology officer with Chainalysis – stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the powerful things about the blockchain is it’s a publicly available ledger. So, I like to say, even if you didn’t know who the subject of the investigation is today, those records are going to still be there six years from now.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Zambia is in the process of <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/zambia-is-looking-into-potential-crypto-regulation/" data-wpel-link="internal">testing digital currencies</a> like bitcoin. The country recently commented that these tests <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/zambia-to-finish-cryptocurrency-regulation-tests-by-june-minister/ar-AA19Muz2" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">are almost finished</a>, and that the nation is planning to use the results of the tests as a means of doling out solid crypto regulation once and for all.</p>
<h2>Zambia is Almost Done with Its Crypto Tests</h2>
<p>There have been wide calls for crypto regulation over the past six months given the fall of crypto exchange FTX, which occurred in November of last year. Rising to fame in 2019, it took only three years for FTX to be listed as one of the top five digital currency trading platforms in the world, and the man behind it – Sam Bankman-Fried – was lauded as a genius who was set to endure high levels of success in the coming future.</p>
<p>Sadly, the company quickly fell apart due to an <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-i-the-fall-of-a-token/" data-wpel-link="internal">alleged liquidity crunch</a>. Following a failed purchase <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-iii-the-rise-and-fall-of-sam-bankman-fried/" data-wpel-link="internal">agreement with Binance</a>, the company <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/what-will-happen-now-that-ftx-is-bankrupt/" data-wpel-link="internal">entered bankruptcy</a> and SBF left his post, though the aftermath was much worse given all the deceitful practices that allegedly went on behind closed doors.</p>
<p>For example, it’s been reported that Bankman-Fried stole user funds to purchase luxury real estate in the Bahamas and to pay off loans with his other company Alameda Research. He was <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-ftxs-disgraced-founder-has-been-arrested/" data-wpel-link="internal">later arrested</a> and is now awaiting trial at his parents’ <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-to-await-trial-at-his-parents-house/" data-wpel-link="internal">home in Northern California</a>.</p>
<p>Because of this, many countries are worried that the crypto space is more vulnerable than ever, and they <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-united-kingdom-announces-plans-for-new-crypto-regulations/" data-wpel-link="internal">want regulations in place</a> to prevent more closures and customer troubles.</p>
<p>The Innovation, Science and Technology Minister of Zambia, a man named Felix Mutati, says his nation is on the verge of implementing rules and laws that will allow safe and controlled crypto transactions for all citizens. In an interview, he commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our main goal in the area of cryptocurrency is to strike a balance between innovation in terms of digital payments&#8230; against citizens&#8217; safety, particularly given that cryptocurrency is very volatile. The central bank is simulating that to see what would happen in the real world. The results will assist us (in) the formulation of the regulation.</p></blockquote>
<p>He also said that many residents of Zambia have grown very interested in crypto investing as of late. Africa has long been considered the perfect crypto haven given how vulnerable it is to corruption and weak financial operations, things bitcoin was initially built to assist with. Mutati continued by saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>What we are seeing is increased appetite to invest in Zambia.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Africa Has Long Been Considered a Crypto Powerhouse</h2>
<p>Other African nations have made huge headways in recent years when it comes to implementing crypto and digital finance laws.</p>
<p>For instance, in 2022, the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/following-el-salvador-the-central-african-republic-declares-btc-legal-tender/" data-wpel-link="internal">Central African Republic</a> (CAR) became the second nation (<a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-fully-legal-in-el-salvador-beginning-september-7/" data-wpel-link="internal">after El Salvador</a>) to list bitcoin as legal tender, meaning it could be used for purchases.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Niagara Falls Planning Board in New York is <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/planning-board-prepared-recommend-operating-112000864.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">permitting a crypto mining</a> facility known as Block Fusion to move forward with its blockchain and crypto extraction plans following <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/crypto-firm-block-fusion-in-legal-battle-with-niagara-falls/" data-wpel-link="internal">a long legal battle</a>. The company recently applied to set up quarters in the Empire State, and those on the planning board heard no objections to the firm going ahead with its agenda.</p>
<h2>New York and Crypto Can&#8217;t Seem to Solidify Their Relationship</h2>
<p>Block Fusion has received a high-energy use operating permit from the city to ensure that it can operate its energy intensive mining rigs and other machinery, which will ultimately lead to more bitcoin and crypto units being moved from the blockchain and placed in circulation.</p>
<p>The news comes at a rather unusual time given how nasty New York has been towards crypto. The recent headline has a lot of people wondering, “Why can’t the region just make up its mind about crypto, already?” At one moment, it appears to hate crypto with a passion, and it’s hellbent on making sure there’s no innovation within its borders pertaining to the digital currency arena. The next minute, it’s on the verge of bowing down to it and making it a national currency of sorts.</p>
<p>Some of the negative behavior stemming from New York towards bitcoin and crypto resulted in a current two-year <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/new-york-signs-crypto-moratorium-into-law/" data-wpel-link="internal">moratorium on crypto mining</a>. This moratorium prevented any digital currency mining businesses from setting up shop within New York unless they operated fully on clean energy. The state expressed concern that the amount of energy utilized for crypto mining was bringing the planet to its knees and taking it down a dark and irreversible path.</p>
<p>In addition, the state’s attorney general Leticia James has made a real name for herself in recent weeks suing practically every crypto company she can, from <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/new-york-attorney-generals-office-now-suing-ku-coin-exchange/" data-wpel-link="internal">Ku Coin</a> to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/new-york-sues-crypto-lending-network-celsius-and-its-former-ceo/" data-wpel-link="internal">Celsius</a>. She says that these companies engaged in fraud and other illicit behavior, and she’s set on ensuring these companies get the penalties they deserve and that they cannot take advantage of native residents (or their money).</p>
<p>Lastly, the state issued the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/bitlicense/" data-wpel-link="internal">BitLicense</a> back in 2015. This document called for heavy regulations to be imposed on crypto companies along with high documentation fees. It all proved too much for several companies, which merely packed up their bags and left the Big Apple for good.</p>
<p>All this (and more) would suggest the Empire State doesn’t care for crypto and wants nothing to do with it, but the news related above says otherwise. Also, it was recently <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/new-york-considers-crypto-as-a-method-of-payment/" data-wpel-link="internal">mentioned that New York</a> is now looking into crypto for payments, something nobody saw coming in any way, shape, or form.</p>
<h2>Set in Stone?</h2>
<p>Planning Board Chairman Tony Palmer said:</p>
<blockquote><p>At our last meeting, we were told this is pretty cut and dried. There&#8217;s not much we can do.</p></blockquote>
