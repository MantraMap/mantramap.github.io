<p>The Pok&eacute;mon Company is taking an Australian crypto game company to court for using characters from the Pok&eacute;mon franchise without permission.</p>
<p>The Pok&eacute;mon Company International (TPCi) is suing Pok&eacute;mon Pty Ltd, an Australian company, in the Federal Court of Australia over the advertisement of a new NFT-based Pok&eacute;mon mobile game called Pok&eacute;World, under the name Kotiota Studios.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The NFT game lets a player choose a starting Pok&eacute;mon from a selection of Charmander, Pikachu, or Eevee, then allows the player to battle others for resources and $POKESHARD currency. In-game items such as food, clothing, and amulets etc., are minted on the blockchain as NFTs.</p>
<p>TPCi claims that Pok&eacute;mon Pty Ltd has falsely advertised itself as a contractor for the Pok&eacute;mon Company and has listed Pok&eacute;mon Scarlet, Pok&eacute;mon Violet, Pok&eacute;mon Home, and the unreleased Pok&eacute;mon Sleep as games it has worked on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TPCi has requested that the court stop Pok&eacute;mon Pty Ltd from using its trademarks on the PokeWorld website and social media, and from launching the game or selling any NFTs using TPCi's intellectual property.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Kotiota Studios team reportedly contacted media outlets to promote their game, which alerted TPCi to the situation. The first hearing for the case took place on December 21st, 2022, with TPCi's legal counsel present but no representatives from Kotiota Studios.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Counsel for TPCi stated:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The PokeWorld Website advertises a new game &ldquo;brought to you by The Pok&eacute;mon Company International and Kotiota&ldquo;. I understand that Kotiota Studios (Kotiota) is an entity related to the respondents in their business endeavour the subject of these proceedings. On that website, there is a section titled &ldquo;2022-2023 ROADMAP&rdquo; which appears to outline the timeline for the launch of PokeWorld and release of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) related to Pok&eacute;mon characters. A review of that web page indicates that the PokeWorld game will launch in January 2023.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The court has stated that TPCi has a strong case and is seeking more information before determining costs or damages. Further legal action may be taken if Pok&eacute;mon Pty Ltd does not respond.</p>
