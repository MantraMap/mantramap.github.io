					<description><![CDATA[Ethereum is currently the leader in decentralized finance, non-fungible tokens, and smart contracts, and it continues to maintain its position as the dominant cryptocurrency in the altcoin market. This has led to Ethereum having the highest rate of creation of new addresses when compared to the other blockchains. However, data suggests most of these new addresses are dumped just after a few days.  New Ethereum Wallets Are Used for Only a Short Time Ethereum is second to Bitcoin in terms of unique addresses. Ycharts estimates put the number of unique addresses on the Ethereum network to around 239.62 million. However, on-chain transaction data shows that if you&#8217;ve just created a new Ethereum wallet, chances are you won&#8217;t be using it for long.  Related Reading: Court Filing Suggests FTX’s $2 Billion Lawsuit Against Genesis Is Coming To An End According to crypto data analyst Jack Gorman, over 70% of new Ethereum wallets are used for less than 30 days before the owners stop transacting completely. While taking to a customized graph on Dune Analytics, a blockchain ecosystem analytics platform, the data analyst noted the rate of creation and abandonment of new Ethereum addresses. The data show that Ethereum has one of the highest rates of new addresses, with 2 million new wallets per month. In the past year alone, more than 26.69 million wallets were created. However, most new addresses display minimal activity, with 66% only active for one day and 95.5% being active for less than ten days. For instance, in May 2023, 2.41 million addresses were created, with only 6.91% making transactions after 30 days.  ETH price sitting at $1,876 &#124; Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com Overall, monthly active addresses total around 4.5 million to 7 million. This means that most wallets don&#8217;t last long, and only 1.9 million are active for more than 10 days. Fewer addresses are used frequently and long-term, with only 400,000 addresses completing more than 100 transactions in the past year. Why Are There So ETH Addresses? Ethereum has had one of the most impressive adoption rates in recent years. The creation of new addresses provides valuable insights into improving adoption and longevity, and the creation and abandonment of addresses can be traced to airdrop hunters. Airdrop hunters create multiple addresses with the sole aim of farming ERC-20 tokens from airdrops.  Related Reading: Shiba Inu Reclaims 14th Spot In Market After 5% Jump While the retention rate of new wallets is really low, Ethereum is blessed with various holders, including smart contract addresses and centralized exchanges.

					<description><![CDATA[Shiba Inu, one of the well-known alternative coins on the cryptocurrency market, has seen its price rise dramatically over the past week. This increase in value can be primarily attributable to whale activities, which have significantly improved the performance of the meme coin. Shiba Inu has distinguished itself among the many alternative cryptocurrencies with a fantastic price increase. Shiba Inu fans and investors have been closely keeping tabs on the market&#8217;s developments and have seen a rapid rise in the asset&#8217;s value.

Since the beginning of June, addresses holding 10 million to 100 billion SHIB tokens (Shina Inu whales) have purchased a total of 1.11 trillion SHIB. Source: Santiment Whales Scoop Big Amounts Of SHIB Whale activity refers to the involvement of large investors who hold large amounts of SHIB. Their actions, such as buying and trading the coin, contribute to the price hike and positive market sentiment surrounding the meme coin. Additionally, Santiment data revealed that over the past two to three months, huge Shina Inu wallets belonging to the &#8220;shark&#8221; and &#8220;dolphin&#8221; categories have purchased SHIB valued at more than $9 million. As of Friday, these significant investors held $32.49 trillion worth of SHIB securities. The group owns SHIB, worth about $266 million in total. SHIB total market cap at $5 billion on the weekend chart at TradingView.com This increase in whale activity occurs before the launch of the layer-2 solution Shibarium, which is a significant event for the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Shibarium&#8217;s launch has been anticipated by cryptocurrency fans, who observed a noticeable increase in buying activity in recent days. Investors and traders alike have expressed great excitement about the upcoming launch of Shibarium.

Source: CoinGecko Shibarium, which offers a second-layer solution to improve the network&#8217;s scalability and general efficiency, is a significant advancement for the SHIB ecosystem. Related Reading: Traders’ Interest In XRP Remains Solid Despite Price Retreat, Data Shows The rising demand for the SHIB coin has increased the importance of a robust infrastructure that can process a large number of transactions quickly and efficiently.

					<description><![CDATA[Blockchain technology is continually reshaping the financial industry, offering promising transformations in transaction processing. Its potential is immense, as outlined in a recent report by digital payment network Ripple in collaboration with the United States Faster Payments Council (FPC). The report presents a robust case for blockchain&#8217;s role in expediting payment systems and the ensuing cost savings. But is the financial sector ready to embrace this emerging technology on a large scale? Related Reading: Ripple Attorney Withdraws From SEC Lawsuit, Will It Affect XRP? Financial Institutions To Embrace Faster Payment Systems With Blockchain The survey, which received inputs from 300 finance professionals spanning 45 countries, sheds light on the growing consensus about the advantages of blockchain. It illustrates a palpable shift in the perception of this technology across sectors including fintech, banking, retail, consumer technology, and media. Results show that global payments leaders are dissatisfied with legacy rails for cross-border payments. Learn why 97% believe #blockchain and #crypto will transform the way money moves in our latest whitepaper with @Faster_Payments. https://t.co/qacuAAzZrR pic.twitter.com/ForjM05Wbb — Ripple (@Ripple) July 28, 2023 The majority of the surveyed professionals, comprising analysts, directors, and CEOs, strongly assert the potential of blockchain. Approximately 97% are confident that blockchain technology will be instrumental in expediting payment processes over the upcoming three years This widely-held conviction underscores the positive outlook toward blockchain, indicating a readiness to welcome its disruptive capabilities. A Catalyst For Cost-Efficiency In Cross-Border Transactions? Furthermore, the report highlights the cost-saving potential of cryptocurrencies. More than half of the respondents agreed that cryptocurrencies could significantly reduce payment costs, both domestically and internationally. The report predicts that blockchain&#8217;s application in global transactions could save financial institutions an estimated $10 billion in cross-border payment costs by 2030, substantiated by findings from fintech analysis firm, Juniper Research. With the rapid growth of e-commerce and businesses looking to penetrate international markets, the report anticipates a surge in cross-border payments. It estimates global cross-border payment flows could reach roughly $156 trillion by 2030, buoyed by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5%. Despite the optimistic views, the survey revealed a divide in opinions regarding the timeline for widespread merchant adoption of digital currency payments. About 50% of the respondents were optimistic about significant merchant adoption within the next three years. However, predictions varied for the likelihood of adoption within the next year, with the Middle East and African regions exhibiting the most confidence and Asia-Pacific the least.

The token also recorded a 4.21% price increase in the last 24 hours, indicating strong momentum in the short term. However, a minor correction of 0.81% in the past hour highlights the market&#8217;s volatility. Currently trading at $1,220.43 per MKR, the token remains 80.75% below its all-time high of $6,339.02. While the recent price surge is encouraging, it is essential to consider the historical context and the factors influencing the crypto market&#8217;s dynamics. The MakerDAO community recently voted in favor of a temporary increase to the interest rate paid to holders of the protocol&#8217;s decentralized stablecoin, DAI. This proposal introduced the Enhanced Dai Savings Rate (EDSR), a mechanism to temporarily boost the Dai Savings Rate (DSR) to users during periods of low utilization. Proposed by Maker founder Rune Christensen, the EDSR could increase the effective DSR to 8% when the utilization ranges from 0% to 20%. The mechanism is designed to decrease the DSR as utilization increases gradually.

In the past few months, the protocol has raised the DSR thrice: first to 1% in November, then to 3.3% in May, and finally incorporating a marginal increase to 3.49% in June. The latest EDSR proposal aims to incentivize DAI holders and stimulate demand for the stablecoin. Stimulating Demand For DAI Despite the recent increase in the DSR, data from Dai Stats shows that investors have only deposited $307 million in the DSR, representing a modest 6.7% of the total supply of DAI. The amount of DAI in circulation decreased to $4.6 billion from over $6.9 billion in the previous year. In response to the declining circulation of Maker&#8217;s dollar-pegged stablecoin, the protocol is taking proactive steps to spur demand for DAI. By enhancing the interest rate DAI holders can earn, the protocol aims to attract more users and create a favorable ecosystem for DAI utilization. Related Reading: Tether (USDT) Market Cap Reaches New Peak, Edges Toward $84 Billion Mark The broader stablecoin market has also experienced a downtrend, with the total market capitalization sinking to $127 billion from nearly $160 billion a year ago. The introduction of EDSR is seen as a strategic move to increase the appeal of DAI and strengthen its position in the competitive stablecoin landscape. What&#8217;s Next For Maker (MKR)? As Maker continues improving the DAI ecosystem, investors closely monitor its governance decisions and the market&#8217;s response to the enhanced interest rate mechanism. The success of the EDSR proposal could drive further adoption of DAI and contribute to its overall liquidity in the market. Moreover, the broader crypto market&#8217;s performance and regulatory developments will determine Maker&#8217;s future trajectory. If the bullish sentiments continue, Maker could surpass the $1,300 resistance point but if the opposite occurs the next support levels are $1,200 and $1,180.  (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice.

					<description><![CDATA[This time around, Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX and the world&#8217;s largest manufacturer of electric vehicles, Tesla, is creating a flurry of excitement around cryptocurrencies, maybe with a particular focus on Dogecoin, the well-known parody cryptocurrency. The crypto community has taken note of Musk&#8217;s recent acts since they continue to demonstrate his influence in altering the market dynamics of digital currency. The billionaire Musk, who is also the owner of the X app (formerly known as Twitter), posted on Sunday that &#8220;something special is coming soon.&#8221; Related Reading: CryptoPunks Toughness Tested As NFT Succumbs To 60% Drop In 1 Week Elon Musk Tweet Does It Again This tweet received a lot of positive feedback from the cryptocurrency community, especially from accounts with a Dogecoin theme. Something special coming soon — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 29, 2023 Based on Musk&#8217;s repeated references to this development in the past, many people, including the influencer David Gokhstein, anticipate that X will add DOGE &#8211; the largest meme coin &#8211; as a payment option. This anticipation arises from the fact that Elon Musk has previously made a number of very quiet signals that a similar action may be planned. Dogecoin (DOGE) saw a stunning price increase on Friday, garnering a lot of attention in the cryptocurrency community. On that particular day, DOGE&#8217;s price noticedably increased by over 10%, breaking past the $0.07 barrier mark. Dogecoin Rising At $0.08 When this article was being written, DOGE was trading at $0.08, up 2.7% over the previous day. However, the meme coin really proved its worth on a weekly basis, rising in value by about 13% in response to Musk&#8217;s post. Source: Coingecko This positive momentum-driven upward rise in value led to a sizable increase in the market capitalisation of the asset. The cryptocurrency&#8217;s market cap increased as a result, rising by an estimated $1 billion to a new high of $10.66 billion from its previous value of $9.67 billion. Related Reading: Traders’ Interest In XRP Remains Solid Despite Price Retreat, Data Shows The reasons for this remarkable rise have been the subject of heated speculation among many members of the crypto community. One of the more intriguing current theories is on the potential integration of DOGE, the disputed cryptocurrency, into the source code of Tesla&#8217;s website&#8217;s payment page. DOGE market cap currently at $11.8 billion on the weekly chart: TradingView.com Price Boom Soon? As enthusiasts and investors alike anticipate the potential effects of such a development, this notion has been spreading. The mere possibility of DOGE becoming a payment option for Tesla has sparked curiosity and led to upbeat predictions for the cryptocurrency&#8217;s future. If Elon Musk does truly integrate DOGE payments into his X app, Dogecoin will experience a solid increase in utility and acceptance, as well as a significant price boom.

					<description><![CDATA[The legal tussle between bankrupt crypto exchange FTX and crypto lender Genesis seems to be coming to a resolution, a recent court filing reveals. According to the letter filed yesterday at the US bankruptcy court for the Southern District of New York, both firms &#8211; who happened to have filed for bankruptcy &#8211; have agreed to settle their ongoing billion-dollar dispute.  How The Feud Began FTX filed a motion in May this year to recover its funds from Genesis and “non-debtor affiliates” so the company could pay back its creditors. The motion went as far as describing Genesis (who attributed its solvency issues to FTX’s collapse) as “one of the main feeder funds and instrumental to its [FTX and Sister company Alameda Research] fraudulent business model.” Related Reading: Shiba Inu Reclaims 14th Spot In Market After 5% Jump FTX further claimed that Genesis received “avoidable transfers” from FTX’s debtors totaling almost $3.9 billion. In response, Genesis denied owing FTX and filed a motion asking the bankruptcy judge to rule its debt to FTX as zero. However, a subsequent letter from FTX to the bankruptcy judge showed that the company had reduced its claim from $3.9 billion to $2 billion. FTT token trades at $1.3 amid exchange's woes &#124; Source: FTTUSD on Tradingview.com FTX’s claim could have delayed a creditor payout and slowed Genesis’ bankruptcy proceedings. However, with settlement in sight, things are likely to move along quickly, as according to the letter, FTX, its associated debtors, and debtors in its Chapter 11 bankruptcy case have reached a preliminary agreement. The court filing reads: The parties have reached an agreement in principle, subject to documentation, regarding a settlement that would resolve, among other things, the claims asserted by the FTX debtors against the debtors in these Chapter 11 Cases and the claims asserted by the Genesis debtors against the FTX debtors in the FTX Chapter 11 cases. Genesis Still Not In The Clear Despite reaching a settlement with FTX, crypto lending platform Genesis still has other lawsuits to deal with, including one filed by Gemini against its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), and its CEO, Barry Silbert. Gemini’s co-founder Cameron Winklevoss called out Barry Silbert on Twitter in an open letter, claiming that Silbert and DCG had engaged in “Fraudulent Behavior.”  Related Reading: This Machine Learning Tool Was Asked To Predict XRP Price, Here’s What It Said He warned that Silbert’s failure to reply and come to the negotiation table by Friday would result in a lawsuit. In a follow-up tweet, Winklevoss also tabled a “best and final offer” involving a repayment plan. Still, Silbert and DCG failed to reply, and true to his words, Winklevoss and Gemini filed a lawsuit against DCG and Silbert for fraud on July 7.

					<description><![CDATA[After a rough few months of slipping down the ranks, Shiba Inu is back in the top 15 cryptocurrencies by market cap. In the last 24 hours, the price of Shiba Inu has spiked in excess of 5%, allowing it to overtake cryptocurrencies like Wrapped Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash to reach the 14th spot with a market cap of $4.8 billion. Shiba Inu Jumps 5% In 24 Hours, Reclaiming 14th Spot The price of the majority of cryptocurrencies seems to be plateauing in the past week, with some even losing some of their market cap. However, meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin seem to be doing slightly well, with DOGE leading the pack with a 7.02% gain in the past seven days.  Related Reading: VC Firm Sequoia Capital Slashes Crypto Fund By 65% Amid Bear Market In the case of Shiba Inu (SHIB), the altcoin has found a bit of momentum, amassing an increase of 293.16% in trading volume in the past 24 hours.  As usual with volatile meme coins, it’s hard to pin down an exact catalyst of the spike. However, the price jump seems to have come after Shiba Inu&#8217;s developers announced the release of a testnet bridge between Shibarium and Ethereum. Shibarium to Ethereum Testnet Bridge Pushes SHIB&#8217;s Price by 5% Shiba Inu has come a long way since its creation as a meme coin made just to challenge the popular Dogecoin (DOGE). However, the Shiba Inu ecosystem now has a lot of following, investors, developers, and an active community.  Shiba Inu developers are now working on a Layer-2 upgrade with the aim of developing the ecosystem and becoming a serious blockchain contender. The network, which will operate on top of Ethereum, is called Shibarium and was announced earlier in March. When Shibarium is launched, it is expected to help minimize costs and increase transaction speeds. 🔥 Shibarium Beta Bridge has gone live for public testing! 🎉 Be among the first to try out this revolutionary cross-chain solution. Remember, always exercise caution and verify authenticity before connecting your wallet to any website. PLEASE DO NOT USE YOUR REAL ASSETS!… pic.twitter.com/7yfhX8gQc6 — 𝐋𝐔𝐂𝐈𝐄 (@LucieSHIB) July 26, 2023 On July 28, SHIB devs began testing a bridge that allows tokens to be easily transferred between the Shibarium and Ethereum. The testnet release is an important step toward making Shibarium a reality. This cross-chain solution seems to have sparked the interest of SHIB investors, as the price of the token spiked in the hours after.  Related Reading: Ripple Attorney Withdraws From SEC Lawsuit, Will It Affect XRP? How High Can The Price Go? Shiba Inu is the second-largest meme coin in terms of market cap. Although the price is now nearly 80% from its all-time high in October 2021, current upgrades show momentum seems to be turning positive. The coming months and the progress of the Shibarium Layer-2 will be crucial in determining whether Shiba Inu can build on this momentum to retest previous highs or whether it continues to plateau.  At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.000008191.

<p>The price of the majority of cryptocurrencies seems to be plateauing in the past week, with some even losing some of their market cap. However, meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin seem to be doing slightly well, with DOGE leading the pack with a 7.02% gain in the past seven days. </p>

<p>In the case of Shiba Inu (SHIB), the altcoin has found a bit of momentum, amassing an increase of 293.16% in trading volume in the past 24 hours. </p>
<p>As usual with volatile meme coins, it’s hard to pin down an exact catalyst of the spike. However, the price jump seems to have come after Shiba Inu&#8217;s developers announced the release of a testnet bridge between Shibarium and Ethereum.</p>
<h2>Shibarium to Ethereum Testnet Bridge Pushes SHIB&#8217;s Price by 5%</h2>
<p>Shiba Inu has come a long way since its creation as a meme coin made just to challenge the popular Dogecoin (DOGE). However, the Shiba Inu ecosystem now has a lot of following, investors, developers, and an active community. </p>
<p>Shiba Inu developers are now working on a Layer-2 upgrade with the aim of developing the ecosystem and becoming a serious blockchain contender. The network, which will operate on top of Ethereum, is called <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shibarium-bridge-goes-live-in-beta-but-theres-a-catch/?swcfpc=1">Shibarium</a> and was announced earlier in March. When Shibarium is launched, it is expected to help minimize costs and increase transaction speeds.</p>

<p>On July 28, SHIB devs began testing a bridge that allows tokens to be easily transferred between the Shibarium and Ethereum. The testnet release is an important step toward making Shibarium a reality. This cross-chain solution seems to have sparked the interest of SHIB investors, as the price of the token spiked in the hours after. </p>

How High Can The Price Go?
<p>Shiba Inu is the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/shiba-inu-will-this-bullish-formation-lead-to-a-25-upsurge/?swcfpc=1">second-largest meme coin in terms of market cap</a>. Although the price is now nearly 80% from its all-time high in October 2021, current upgrades show momentum seems to be turning positive. </p>
<p>The coming months and the progress of the Shibarium Layer-2 will be crucial in determining whether Shiba Inu can build on this momentum to retest previous highs or whether it continues to plateau. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.000008191.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[XRP has been one of the trending tokens following the summary judgment which ruled that the token was not a security, giving its parent company, Ripple, a ‘partial victory’ over the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). That event saw XRP’s price soar to about $0.93.  However, XRP’s price seems to have cooled off, settling at the $0.7 price mark. Despite this, there still seems to be bullish sentiment around XRP’s future price, which is why this Machine Learning tool was consulted to predict XRP’s price.  Here’s What It Said PricePredictions.com, a site powered by an advanced machine learning algorithm that provides current and futuristic trends about several tokens, was consulted in a bid to get an insight into XRP’s future price and to better position themselves in case of a rally by the token.

					<description><![CDATA[Tether USDT has seen its market cap value reach new highs in the month of July. According to a report by on-chain analytics company Into The Block, the world’s largest stablecoin is steadily approaching the key $84 billion mark. Based on data from DeFiLlama, USDT’s market cap is up by over $480 million since the beginning of July, indicating an increasing level of adoption. Generally, the stablecoin’s total market share value has been on the rise for the majority of 2023, moving from $66.23 billion on January 1 to its current value of $83.80 billion. In tandem with USDT’s market cap growth, Into The Block also noted the token’s circulating supply is up by almost 30% year to date. Interestingly, USDT’s market growth has also been reflected in its operator&#8217;s development.  Back in May, Tether Holdings Ltd published its quarterly assurance report announcing a net profit of $1.48 billion for Q1 2023, bringing its excess reserve to an all-time high of $2.44 billion.  Into The Block noted that currently, Tether is well on course to surpass those profit levels in Q2 and Q3 as there is an increase in the amount of USDT being issued.

According to data from DeFiILama, Tether’s market dominance has grown by about 19% in 2023, as the token now accounts for two-thirds of the stablecoin market.  While this development is mainly driven by USDT’s impressive performance, there has also been a notable decline in the market shares of some other prominent stablecoins. &#160; Source: DeFilLama For example, Circle’s USD Coin (USDC), which ranks as the second-largest stablecoin, has seen its market cap fall by a staggering 40% in 2023, with the current value now set at $26.26 billion. Meanwhile, Binance USD (BUSD), with a market cap of $3.71 billion, has shed over 77% of its market shares following an embargo on its issuance earlier this year.  At the time of writing, Tether&#8217;s value remains pegged at $1. With a market cap of 83.80 billion, the stablecoin ranks as the third biggest cryptocurrency falling Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) Tether (USDT) rising market cap in 2023 &#124; Source: USDT Market Cap Daily Chart On Tradingview.com Related Reading: Tether CTO Paulo Adoino Explains 1 Billion USDT Issuance DeFi Stablecoins Gearing Up To Match Centralized Counterparts In other news, DeFi stablecoins have been rolling out some impressive upgrades as they attempt to close the gap between them and their centralized competitors. In a tweet on Friday, Into The Block highlighted some of these developments. Firstly, the MakerDAO recently hiked the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) to 3.49%, and there is the possibility of an increase to 8% in the coming weeks. Furthermore, the Frax protocol will be launching FRAX v3 in August as they look to make FRAX a fully algorithmic token, delinking its minting process from the USDC token. In addition, there is Lybra Finance which lends its stablecoin eUSD to users at an interest rate of 0%. Other DeFi stablecoins with impressive features or upgrades include Curve Finance’s crvUSD and Aave’s GHO.  Featured Image From Barron, Chart From Tradingview]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[AI (artificial intelligence) tokens were one of the most promising assets in the cryptocurrency market at the beginning of 2023. One of the major drivers of this was the launch of ChatGPT &#8211; an AI-based chatbot &#8211; in late 2022, which propelled some AI-related cryptocurrencies to substantial gains. However, the interest in this set of cryptocurrencies appears to be cooling, with data research firm Kaiko revealing a significant decline in trading activity for the AI-related tokens. Related Reading: Traders’ Interest In XRP Remains Solid Despite Price Retreat, Data Shows Lowest Weekly Trading Volume For AI Tokens AI-related tokens registered their lowest weekly trading volume since January 2023, according to a recent data report from Kaiko. In this report, the research platform looked at the trading volume of six of the top seven AI tokens, including FET, INJ, ROSE, AGIX, RNDR, and GRT. Source: Kaiko/Twitter This notable decrease in trading activity suggests a decline in attention from investors since the AI token frenzy peaked in January. And this appears to be reflected in the price performances of many AI-related cryptocurrencies. The Graph (GRT), the largest AI token in the market, was one of the top gainers at the start of 2023, surging by roughly 122% to reach a yearly high of $0.2323 on February 7. However, the price of the GRT token has since plummeted, with a 51% decline from the 2023 peak. Can ChatGPT &#38; OpenAI Do It Again? As mentioned earlier, the surge of interest in AI tokens was partly driven by the launch of ChatGPT. However, there has not been a similar effect on the AI and big-data crypto economy following the launch of Sam Altman’s Worldcoin project and WLD token. On July 24, 2023, Altman, the CEO of OpenAI &#8211; the artificial intelligence company behind ChatGPT &#8211; rolled out his crypto product, releasing the World ID development kit and the WLD token.  The WLD token soared more than 85% to reach an all-time high of $3.3 on the day of launch, according to CoinGecko data. However, the cryptocurrency’s price has declined by over 31% since hitting this peak. Related Reading: Why Worldcoin (WLD) And PEPE Dominate The Crypto Market Trends This Week Although there has been enthusiasm around the launch of Worldcoin, the project &#8211; especially its technology &#8211; has also been met with some skepticism.

Meanwhile, Worldcoin looks set to face some regulatory scrutiny, with the UK’s data regulator Information Commissioner Office (ICO) already making inquiries. France’s privacy regulator CNIL has also questioned the legality of the project’s biometric data collection. While the Worldcoin project and the WLD token seem to be gaining some traction at the moment, it remains to be seen how they will impact the AI and big-data crypto economy.
