<p class="s3">Polygon (MATIC) and Bitcoin (BTC) have recently experienced strong runs. But a new entry has surprised investors with its high presale numbers.</p>
<p class="s3">The presale for Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) just passed out of the first three phases, showing no signs of slowing down. Currently on the fourth presale stage, with the price at $0.06, analysts predict a rise to $0.24. Investors are looking further into each project and discussing how Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) transformed the low-cap market.</p>

<p class="s3">Bitcoin (BTC) is likely to move upward after FTX's bankruptcy caused a decline in price</p>
<p class="s3">Bitcoin (BTC) is still the most valuable cryptocurrency, but this last week it gained significant value. Bitcoin (BTC) hit its all-time high of $68,789 in November 2021. Bitcoin (BTC) is now worth about $20,000.</p>
<p class="s3">Even though Bitcoin's (BTC) price had gone up, several different things exacerbated the bear market. There is an ongoing discussion about whether Bitcoin (BTC) is a real way to save money. It was thought it would do well in an environment with high inflation, but so far, it hasn't lived up to that hope.</p>
<p class="s3">One of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, FTX, went bankrupt because $8 billion was missing from their financial statements. This caused the most recent drop. In addition, it also triggered people to sell in a panic and sent Bitcoin (BTC) down. Nevertheless, as more people use Bitcoin (BTC) as a currency and a way to save money, Bitcoin&rsquo;s (BTC) value will likely increase over time.</p>

<p class="s3">Polygon (MATIC) is recovering from its massive drop in price</p>
<p class="s3">Polygon (MATIC) is a protocol and a framework that helps build and connect blockchain platforms that work with Ethereum. This protocol works by putting scalable Ethereum solutions into groups to help the ecosystem of Ethereum with more than one chain.</p>
<p class="s3">Polygon (MATIC) is the Ethereum token that runs the Polygon (MATIC) Network. MATIC is also the native token of Polygon (MATIC). Polygon (MATIC) uses a Layer-2 sidechain, which is a blockchain that runs along with the main Ethereum chain, to make transactions on Ethereum faster and cheaper.</p>
<p class="s3">Polygon's (MATIC) collective security model is entirely optional. Sovereign platforms can keep their self-governance and flexibility if they don't need extra security. Polygon (MATIC) also says that it is flexible enough to work with any scaling solution, not just the optimistic rollups, ZK-rollups, and Plasma chains that are already planned.</p>

<p class="s3">Orbeon Protocol (ORBN): a crypto investment platform for Web3 startups</p>
<p class="s3">The first people to put money into a business almost always get the best returns. Nevertheless, the sad reality is that these chances usually go to people who are rich and have good connections. Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) wants to make early-stage investments easier for everyone to participate in by making the process easier.</p>
<p class="s3">The Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) team uses blockchain technology and diversifies non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to make this possible. Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) tokenizes investments so that anyone can invest as little as $1 in early-stage companies.</p>
<p class="s3">For new businesses, this is a chance to change the game. They can now reach out to a much larger group of possible investors and raise money more quickly. In addition, regular investors can now enter the venture capital market, which used to be closed to them.</p>
<p class="s3">The Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) platform is built around smart contracts. For example, if a startup doesn't meet its goals, the money will be returned to the people who pledged it.</p>
<p class="s3">The Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) ecosystem is run by the Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) token, which gives its owners the right to vote and access unique benefits, such as early entry to investment options and staking rewards. The price of Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) tokens has increased by almost 1400% within a few weeks from their initial sale price of $0.004 to $0.06 per token.</p>
