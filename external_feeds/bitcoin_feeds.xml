Davidson explained that CBDCs corrupt money into a &#8220;tool for coercion&#8221; and detailed that there was no legal way of issuing such a currency without legislation.</strong></p>
<h2>U.S. Representative Warren Davidson: CBDCs &#8216;Corrupt Money&#8217;</h2>
<p>Warren Davidson, a U.S. representative for the state of Ohio and a member of the House Committee on Financial Services, has revealed its stance on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and the possibility of issuing a digital dollar in the country.</p>
<p>Commenting on a recent <a href="https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/central-bank-digital-currency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> published by the Washington-based Cato Institute, where the institution criticizes the idea of CBDCs and lists the risk associated with their issuance, Davidson <a href="https://twitter.com/WarrenDavidson/status/1675875960082636800?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Central bank digital currency (CBDC) corrupts money into tool for coercion &amp; control. Thankfully, there is no legal way to implement CBDC in America without legislation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Davidson, who <a href="https://www.soundmoneydefense.org/news/2020/08/14/sound-money-caucus-capitol-hill-000275" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> the &#8220;Sound Money Caucus,&#8221; which promotes sound fiscal and monetary policy in the United States, explained that &#8220;a bipartisan coalition in Congress is working to actively ban CBDC development or implementation.&#8221;</p>

<h2>The Move to Avoid a Digital Dollar in America</h2>
<p>Davidson is not the only congressman worried about the hypothetical issuance of a digital dollar in the U.S. In May, Congressman Alex Mooney introduced the Digital Dollar Pilot Prevention Act to close any regulatory loopholes on this issue.</p>
<p>The bill was <a href="https://mooney.house.gov/congressman-mooney-introduces-the-digital-dollar-pilot-prevention-act/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advertised</a> as an instrument that would &#8220;prohibit the Federal Reserve from establishing, carrying out, or approving a program intended to test the practicability of issuing a CBDC.&#8221;</p>
<p>The July slated launch of Fednow, a payments system for banks and credit unions, has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/is-fednow-the-first-step-towards-a-central-bank-digital-currency-speculations-rise-ahead-of-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ignited</a> worries about its relation with the digitalization of the U.S. dollar. However, the Federal Reserve has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/not-related-to-a-digital-currency-us-central-bank-addresses-concerns-over-fednow-payment-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">denied</a> these allegations, stating that Fednow &#8220;is neither a form of currency nor a step toward eliminating any form of payment, including cash.&#8221;</p>
<p>Others have also railed against the effects of a Fed-issued CBDC. Economist Jim Rickards recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-jim-rickards-warns-of-a-cbdc-supported-social-credit-system-in-the-us-it-can-happen-here/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">warned</a> about how tissuing a digital dollar could support creating a China-like social credit system. Presidential Candidate John F. Kennedy Jr. referred to this topic, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kennedy-jr-government-could-ban-seize-bitcoin-cbdcs-could-lead-to-financial-slavery-political-tyranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stating</a> that a &#8220;CBDC tied to digital ID and social credit score will allow the government to freeze your assets or limit your spending to approved vendors if you fail to comply.&#8221;</p>

It makes mistakes,” the billionaire stressed, adding that if the SEC had taken a similar approach to Japan, no one in the U.S. would have lost money when the crypto exchange FTX collapsed.</strong></p>
<h2>Mark Cuban Criticizes SEC and US Crypto Regulation</h2>
<p>Shark Tank star and the owner of the NBA team Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban, has slammed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for choosing a wrong path to regulate the crypto sector.</p>
<p>Many crypto proponents have criticized the SEC and its chairman, Gary Gensler, for taking an <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-enforcement-remains-focused-on-crypto-chair-gensler-says-hes-impressed-with-enforcement-results/">enforcement-centric</a> approach to regulating the crypto sector. The securities regulator recently took action against major crypto exchanges, including <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-becomes-the-latest-target-of-sec-accused-of-unregistered-brokerage-and-securities-violations/">Coinbase</a> and .</p>
<p>Cuban emphasized that the SEC “chose to litigate to regulate.” He stated, “You need to face the fact of the matter that crypto is one more technology that will succeed or fail based on its merits,” adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s the SEC that chose the wrong path to regulate crypto and cost billions. The SEC is not infallible. It makes mistakes. In this case, it chose the wrong course.</p></blockquote>
<p>While many people in the crypto sector have urged the SEC to provide clear rules for crypto firms to comply with regulations, SEC Chairman Gensler has repeatedly said that the law is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chair-gensler-insists-most-crypto-tokens-are-securities-says-the-law-is-clear/">already clear</a> and existing frameworks are sufficient to regulate crypto.</p>
<p>Gensler has also said many times that crypto lending and trading platforms should come in and register. However, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong insisted that he and his exchange tried to register but it was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-ceo-responds-to-sec-lawsuit-accusing-crypto-exchange-of-securities-law-violations/">not possible</a> to do so.</p>
<p>Commenting on Gensler insisting that the existing SEC regulatory framework is sufficient to regulate crypto, Cuban opined:</p>
<blockquote><p>It was arrogant in thinking that its framework covered every possible situation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Several Southeast Asian countries are viewed as more friendly towards cryptocurrencies compared to the U.S., resulting in a growing number of entrepreneurs leaving the country. Venture capitalist Tim Draper, famed for predicting that the price of bitcoin would <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/tim-draper-adjusts-timeframe-for-his-250k-bitcoin-price-forecast/">reach $250K</a> this year, for example, recently stated: &#8220;I think we’ve got a real problem because the SEC has been spreading fear and all of the innovators are leaving the country … This regulation by enforcement makes no sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Dallas Mavericks owner highlighted the contrast between the regulatory strategies of the U.S. SEC and the approach adopted by Japan&#8217;s regulator for the crypto industry. Cuban pointed out that when crypto exchange FTX crashed, “no one in FTX Japan lost money.” The Shark Tank star stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>If the USA/SEC had followed their example by setting clear regulations that required the separation of customer and business funds and clear wallet requirements, no one here would have lost money on FTX.</p></blockquote>
<p>The billionaire further explained: &#8220;In Japan, they were very loud in saying the obvious, that FTX wasn&#8217;t a crypto issue, it was a fraud issue.&#8221; He detailed that the best way to prevent crypto fraud is to &#8220;Set bright-line investor protection regulations, like Japan, that detail the protections required and require registration to confirm adherence. Anyone who doesn&#8217;t register is de-facto in violation, can&#8217;t operate and will be shut down. That&#8217;s how you protect crypto investors. The SEC has it wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last month, Cuban <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/billionaire-mark-cuban-offers-suggestions-on-how-sec-should-regulate-crypto/">offered advice</a> on how the SEC could regulate the crypto industry. He outlined the idea of implementing a crypto-specific registration process. In addition, he suggested that the SEC could develop a token registration framework to accommodate different types of tokens.</p>

Meanwhile, Putin shared that </strong><strong>more than 80 percent of commercial transactions between Russia and China are carried out in Russian rubles and Chinese yuan.</strong></p>
<h2>Putin: Use of National Currencies in Settlements Is Expanding</h2>
<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin took part in a virtual summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation&#8217;s (SCO) Heads of State Council on Tuesday. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired the meeting. It was also attended by Kazakhstan&#8217;s President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, Kyrgyzstan&#8217;s President Sadyr Japarov, Pakistan&#8217;s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Tajikistan&#8217;s President Emomali Rahmon, Uzbekistan&#8217;s President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, and Iran&#8217;s President Ebrahim Raisi.</p>
<p>“We intend to further deepen ties with the members of the Shanghai Organization, and these ties are becoming stronger and more multifaceted,” Putin said at the summit (translated by Google). “Russia&#8217;s trade with the association&#8217;s member states last year increased by more than a third, 37 percent, reaching a record $263 billion. And in January-April of this year, it added another 35 percent,” the Russian leader continued, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>The use of national currencies in mutual settlements is expanding. For example, more than 80 percent of commercial transactions between Russia and the People&#8217;s Republic of China are carried out in rubles and yuan. The share of the Russian currency in export transactions with all SCO countries in 2022 exceeded 40 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Russia takes an active part in the implementation of the SCO road map on the transition to national currencies in mutual trade, approved at the previous summit in Samarkand in Uzbekistan. It is important to continue this work, to take coordinated measures to remove regulatory barriers, establish the necessary payment infrastructure, and create an independent financial system,” Putin emphasized.</p>
<p>He also congratulated Iranian President Raisi on Iran becoming a full member of the SCO and expressed Russia’s support for Belarus to join the SCO as rapidly as possible.</p>
<h2>Xi Considers It Essential to Increase Share of Settlements in National Currencies</h2>
<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping stated at the opening of the SCO summit (translated by Tass):</p>
<blockquote><p>I consider it essential to increase the share of settlements in national currencies within the organization … We need to strengthen cooperation on sovereign digital currencies and work on establishing the SCO Development Bank.</p></blockquote>
<p>Countries worldwide are increasingly advocating for the use of their national currencies in trade settlements, shifting away from the U.S. dollar. The adoption of the Chinese yuan for trade settlements has gained momentum among some nations. Last week, the central bank of Argentina officially included the yuan as a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/argentina-allows-banks-to-open-yuan-accounts-economist-says-it-could-boost-chinese-currency-as-safe-haven-alternative-to-us-dollar/">recognized currency</a> for making deposits in bank accounts.</p>
<p>The BRICS group (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) is leading a global de-dollarization trend. The economic bloc also has a proposal for a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/expert-claims-proposed-brics-common-currency-poised-to-undermine-us-dollar-dominance/">common currency</a> that many expect to erode the dominance of the U.S. dollar if successfully adopted. Recently, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/10-southeast-asian-nations-challenge-dollar-dominance-with-push-for-local-currencies/">ASEAN members</a> also agreed to increase the use of national currencies in trade settlements.</p>

According to the creators of the concept, it can reduce the costs of inscriptions for Ordinal collections by over 90%. The launchpad Luminex, which announced the BRC69 token standard, insists that the &#x201C;brilliance of BRC69 lies in its simplicity.&#x201D;</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>BRC69 Token Standard Aims to Enhance Efficiency of Ordinal Inscriptions on Bitcoin</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
There have been several new concepts created on top of the Bitcoin blockchain via Ordinal inscription technology, and things have progressed further with the advent of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ordinal-inscriptions-surge-past-13-million-amid-game-changing-recursive-inscription-upgrade/">recursive inscriptions</a>. On Monday, the crypto startup <a href="https://luminex.io/">Luminex</a>, a firm that helps projects initiate launchpads, <a href="https://twitter.com/luminexio/status/1675832800761778183?s=20">revealed</a> the BRC69 token standard on Twitter.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;Today, we&#x2019;re excited to introduce BRC69, a revolutionary standard for creating Recursive Ordinals collections with ease,&#x201D; Luminex stated. &#x201C;This standard will be instrumental in launching Recursive collections on Bitcoin.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Luminex also shared the BRC69 token standard&#x2019;s Github, which discloses that the proposed standard employs recursive inscriptions to enhance the efficiency of inscribing on Bitcoin through the Ordinals protocol. By adopting this standard, onchain functionalities like pre-reveal collection launching and onchain reveals can become more accessible and captivating. The breakthrough lies in the automatic rendering of images on the Ordinals explorer, eliminating the need for extra steps.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-596313 size-full" title="New BRC69 Token Standard Promises 90% Savings for Bitcoin's Ordinal Inscriptions" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lum.jpg" alt="New BRC69 Token Standard Promises 90% Savings for Bitcoin's Ordinal Inscriptions" width="1280" height="500" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lum-300x117.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lum-1024x400.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lum-768x300.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lum.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px">&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Consequently, the Github summary says, costs are optimized, while the potential for engaging experiences is maximized. &#x201C;As the Ordinals protocol gains traction, more users are inscribing data into non-fungible Ordinals collections on Bitcoin,&#x201D; Luminex details. &#x201C;This increased usage has led to a higher demand for Bitcoin block space, subsequently causing a rise in Bitcoin network fees.&#x201D; The crypto startup added:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>In order to continue encouraging creators to launch their innovative ideas on the Bitcoin blockchain, we must optimize the current standard for launching Image Ordinals Collections.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#13;<br />
Recursive inscriptions enhance the efficiency of inscriptions by enabling interconnectedness among them. Luminex detailed that with the BRC69 standard, it can &#x201C;reduce the costs of inscriptions for Ordinals collections by over 90% &#x2014; This reduction is achieved through a 4-step process: (1) inscribe traits, (2) deploy collection, (3) compile collection, and (4) mint assets.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
At the time of writing, &#x200B;&#x200B;there have been <a href="https://ordinals.com/inscription/231a29bb7508e4be7d40139f43ffb34955aa89dfc0c789adea7fe97d0d626f15i0">14,685,362</a> Ordinal inscriptions minted on the Bitcoin blockchain. Furthermore, a token standard called BRC20 was created, and to date, there are more than 35,500 BRC20 tokens. According to <a href="https://dune.com/dgtl_assets/bitcoin-ordinals-analysis">statistics</a> collected by Dune Analytics, miners have collected 1,806.44 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, worth $56.14 million using today&#x2019;s <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> exchange rates.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />

<h2>Stark Slams CBDC Creation</h2>
<p>Former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) official John Reed Stark criticized cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in a lengthy tweet on Tuesday. Stark is currently president of cybersecurity firm John Reed Stark Consulting. He founded and served as chief of the SEC Office of Internet Enforcement for 11 years. He was also an SEC enforcement attorney for 15 years.</p>
<p>The longterm crypto skeptic wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>The creation of a CBDC is perhaps the most absurd financial idea in the history of monetary policy.</p></blockquote>
<p>He argued: “First off, just like crypto and stablecoins, you must begin by answering the question of what problem does a CBDC actually solve. Why do we need a CBDC? There is no answer to that question.”</p>
<p>The former SEC official opined: “There already exists a litany of digital currencies that work incredibly well and are also trusted because they are regulated, audited and overseen by democratic government authorities and run by regulated, FDIC or SIPC-insured, U.S. registered financial institutions.”</p>
<p>He then criticized politicians and lawmakers who have voiced their support for crypto innovations, stating: “What is so incredibly disturbing is that under the auspices of ‘innovation,’ some politicians will preach the gospel of crypto while not only completely, ignoring crypto’s dire externalities, but also failing to understand that crypto is not innovative at all.”</p>
<p>Stark proceeded to caution about the risks of a central bank digital currency. &#8220;The risks of a CBDC remain myriad and raise a variety of important policy questions, including how a CIBC might affect financial sector market structure, the cost and availability of credit, the safety and stability of the financial system and the efficacy of monetary policy,&#8221; he detailed.</p>
<p>Concurring with Professor Hilary Allen of the American University Washington College of Law (AUWCL), who testified about stablecoins and CBDCs before the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs in December last year, Stark stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>Not only does a CBDC create a multitude of unnecessary risks relating to global financial systemic stability, but a CBDC also opens up a Pandora’s box of global financial privacy problems, conflicts and cybersecurity concerns.</p></blockquote>
<p>He concluded: “The bottom line: The mammoth costs and challenges of creating a CBDC could not possibly be worth the risks and costs associated with actually having a CBDC.”</p>
<p>The former SEC internet enforcement chief agreed with U.S. Senator <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-senator-introduces-bill-to-ban-direct-to-consumer-central-bank-digital-currency/">Ted Cruz</a> (R-TX) who launched a bill in March &#8220;to prohibit the Federal Reserve from developing a direct-to-consumer” central bank digital currency. “Whatever his rationale, Senator Ted Cruz gets it right with his CBDC prohibitive legislation — it’s a bad idea that needs to be stopped dead in its tracks,” Stark emphasized.</p>
<p>Several other lawmakers have introduced CBDC-related bills. In February, U.S. Congressman <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-lawmaker-launches-cbdc-anti-surveillance-state-act-to-protect-americans-right-to-financial-privacy/">Tom Emmer</a> (R-MN) introduced the Central Bank Digital Currency Anti-Surveillance State Act “to halt efforts of unelected bureaucrats” from “stripping Americans of their right to financial privacy.” U.S. Congressman <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-lawmakers-introduce-bill-to-halt-federal-reserves-digital-dollar-testing-citing-concerns-for-american-liberties/">Alex Mooney</a> (R-WV) announced in May that he has introduced the Digital Dollar Pilot Prevention Act that prohibits the Federal Reserve from establishing, carrying out, or approving a program intended to test the practicability of issuing a CBDC. Several states have also resisted CBDCs. Florida Governor <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/governor-ron-desantis-signs-bill-prohibiting-use-of-central-bank-digital-currencies-in-florida/">Ron DeSantis</a>, for example, signed legislation in May that bans the use of a central bank digital currency in his state.</p>

The records indicate that between March and May 2023, roughly $5.17 million in legal fees were billed to the estate.</strong></p>
<h2>Lawyers and Restructuring Officers Are Profiting From the Slew of Crypto Bankruptcy Cases</h2>
<p>Lawyers for Voyager&#8217;s creditor committee <a href="https://cases.stretto.com/public/x193/11753/PLEADINGS/1175307042380000000001.pdf">unveiled</a> the legal costs concerning the company&#8217;s ongoing bankruptcy proceedings, which began in July 2022, on July 3, 2023. According to the filing, the third interim fee period (March-May 2023) has a compensation request of $5.17 million. The document states that this is the final provisional fee application invoiced by the law firm McDermott Will &amp; Emery LLP.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the filing asserts that the court granted the interim compensation order on August 4, 2022. The attorneys explain that Voyager&#8217;s Chapter 11 case was &#8220;the first to commence following a series of events in the cryptocurrency industry, which are collectively known as the &#8216;crypto winter.'&#8221; McDermott details that throughout the fee period, their litigation team advised the committee in all aspects of the Chapter 11 cases, including a variety of complex matters, which the committee took to maximize recoveries for general unsecured creditors.</p>
<p>Responsibilities included counseling the committee, participating in meetings and negotiations, and &#8220;taking all necessary action to protect and preserve the interests of the committee.&#8221; In April, Voyager Digital was also <a href="https://cases.stretto.com/public/x193/11753/PLEADINGS/1175306282380000000008.pdf">billed $1.1 million</a> in legal fees by its law firm Kirkland &amp; Ellis. Attorneys from Celsius, 3AC, Voyager, and FTX are reportedly reaping significant financial rewards as a result of these bankruptcy cases. John J. Ray III, CEO of FTX, is said to be earning <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/ftx-ceo-john-ray-is-making-1300-an-hour/441235">$1,300 hourly</a> supervising his firm&#8217;s bankruptcy and restructuring.</p>

Bank of America has recently garnered significant attention, with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) reporting that the financial behemoth incurred paper losses exceeding $100 billion by the close of the first quarter.</strong></p>
<h2>Unrealized Losses Haunt Bank of America: $109 Billion and Counting</h2>
<p>The banking industry remains under scrutiny as U.S. banks grapple with hundreds of billions in unrealized losses, with some <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/03/23/banks-unrealized-losses-nearly-2-trillion-treasuries-mortgage-backed-securities/">estimates</a> reaching as high as $1.7 trillion. Attention has particularly turned to Bank of America (NYSE: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-BAC/">BAC</a>), the second-largest financial institution in the United States boasting an estimated balance sheet of around $2.39 trillion.</p>
<p>Recently, the FDIC released data indicating that Bank of America is confronting a loss of approximately <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4614821-bank-of-america-stock-109-billion-of-paper-losses-spell-earnings-trouble?mailingid=31977240&amp;messageid=must_reads&amp;serial=31977240.3045092&amp;utm_campaign=Must%2BReads%2Brecurring%2B2023-07-03&amp;utm_content=seeking_alpha&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=seeking_alpha&amp;utm_term=must_reads">$109 billion</a>. During the Covid-19 pandemic, when interest rates were low and funds were readily accessible, Bank of America seemingly made a substantial investment in assets such as U.S. government bonds.</p>
<p>At that point, the bank, along with many others, deemed these bonds as safe and risk-free investments, despite their comparatively modest yields. However, the situation altered as inflation surged and the approach to economic management shifted.</p>
<p>The U.S. Federal Reserve <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fed-chair-powell-signals-more-rate-hikes-this-year-as-taming-inflation-has-long-way-to-go/">transitioned</a> from accommodating monetary policies to quantitative tightening, implementing the highest <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/FRED-FEDFUNDS/">federal funds rate</a> in 16 years. According to FDIC data, as <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/df4f343c-5666-43a2-ba01-ef315bfb119a">reported</a> by the Financial Times (FT), Bank of America&#8217;s losses reveal that the bank holds a fifth of the $515 billion in unrealized losses held by the nation&#8217;s banks at the end of Q1.</p>
<p>Dick Bove, the chief strategist at boutique broker Odeon Capital, commented to FT that “[Bank of America CEO] Brian Moynihan has done a phenomenal job in handling the bank’s operations, but if you look at the bank’s balance sheet, it’s a mess.” Although Bank of America&#8217;s stock has seen a 3% increase against the U.S. dollar in the past 30 days, <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-BAC/">statistics</a> spanning six months show a decline of over 13% in the bank&#8217;s shares.</p>
<p>Financial institutions, such as Bank of America, have incurred <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fed-reveals-722-banks-reported-unrealized-losses-over-50-of-capital-as-concerns-over-us-banking-crisis-grow/">unrealized losses</a> that are much greater than the record losses recorded in 2008. Troubled balance sheets have been the driving force behind the financial turmoil experienced by Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic.</p>
<p>Multiple market observers anticipate further bank failures, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-warns-more-banks-are-about-to-fail/">echoing the sentiments</a> of Robert Kiyosaki, the author of the best-selling book &#8220;Rich Dad Poor Dad.&#8221; In April, Jamie Dimon, the head of JPMorgan Chase, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-says-banking-crisis-not-over-warns-of-repercussions-for-years-to-come/">asserted</a> that the consequences of the U.S. banking crisis will reverberate &#8220;for years to come.&#8221;</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think the long-term implications of Bank of America&#8217;s $109 billion in paper losses will be for the U.S. banking industry and the overall economy? Do you think the high rate environment will lead to more losses? Share your thoughts and opinions about this subject in the comments section below.</strong></em></p>

Emphasizing the potential to revive the cherished &#8220;American dream,&#8221; Biden has passionately advocated for his plan. Nevertheless, the president&#8217;s approval rating has been extremely lackluster, as indicated by a recent Realclearpolitics poll, which reveals that merely 24% of the adult population perceives his economic leadership as effective.</strong></p>
<h2>Americans Are Skeptical and Doubt the Effectiveness of ‘Bidenomics’</h2>
<p>The current president of the United States believes that emphasizing his administration&#8217;s economic plan called &#8220;Bidenomics&#8221; will aid in solidifying his re-election campaign for 2024. Biden&#8217;s approval ratings have been notably low lately, and his team believes that the highly skeptical American public will embrace his Bidenomics theme. “Trickle-down meant slashing public investment that helped drive long-term growth,” Biden <a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1675999107008155649?s=20">tweeted</a> on Tuesday, asserting that “under Bidenomics, we’re turning this around.”</p>
<p>The responses to Biden&#8217;s tweet indicate that many Americans lack respect for the president and doubt the effectiveness of Bidenomics. One person <a href="https://twitter.com/sabback/status/1676031859770138624?s=20">responded</a> with a meme stating, “The only thing deeper than our national debt is the Biden’s family corruption.” Another individual <a href="https://twitter.com/m3lchizedek/status/1676016389969285121?s=20">commented</a>, “Fire whoever came up with Bidenomics.” Others <a href="https://twitter.com/v1rtu4lm3me5/status/1675999353922801665?s=20">highlighted</a> that this Fourth of July weekend will be the second most expensive in the past decade. In an <a href="https://rollcall.com/2023/06/28/bidenomics-wont-fix-presidents-economic-problems/">opinion editorial</a> on Rollcall.com, author David Winston explains that Bidenomics will not address the president&#8217;s economic challenges.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, cherry-picking and manipulating data to serve Biden’s reelection efforts has become the hallmark of the administration’s communications strategy,” Winston detailed. Biden has faced criticism for selectively choosing and sharing &#8220;highly misleading&#8221; statements about his economic achievements on Twitter. On June 21, Biden <a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1671612705378127873?s=20">tweeted</a>, “I cut the deficit by 1.7 trillion dollars in two years – that&#8217;s more than any president on record.” However, Twitter&#8217;s Community Notes intervened to correct Biden&#8217;s false claims, stating that “fact-checkers have disputed its accuracy.”</p>

<p>During the Biden administration, the United States experienced a surge in inflation, reaching the highest level in 40 years. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/07/13/bidens-job-rating-slumps-as-publics-view-of-economy-turns-more-negative/">Polls</a> indicate that Americans perceive Biden&#8217;s plans as detrimental to the economy, and public sentiment towards the economy is at its lowest point in years. <a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2022/05/18/the-biden-effect-is-real/">Criticism</a> has been directed towards Biden for imposing increased taxes on American businesses, with concerns that his tax policies disproportionately affect the lower and middle classes instead of targeting the wealthy. Additionally, the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-reserve-chair-pushes-stronger-measures-to-tackle-inflation-considers-back-to-back-rate-hikes/">federal funds rate</a> has reached its highest level in over 16 years, leading to a credit-tightening situation nationwide.</p>
<p>Furthermore, during Biden&#8217;s presidency, the United States experienced the second, third, and fourth-largest<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_bank_failures_in_the_United_States"> bank failures</a> in American history. Last year, the Biden administration faced <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biden-administration-accused-of-propaganda-and-redefining-a-recessions-technical-definition/">allegations</a> of propaganda and altering the technical definition of a recession. The U.S. House Ways and Means Committee <a href="https://waysandmeans.house.gov/fact-check-president-bidens-rhetoric-doesnt-match-his-results-economy-continues-to-fall-short-of-expectations/">reported</a> that the economy, under Biden&#8217;s policies, fell short of expectations in seven out of the last eight economic growth reports. Critics have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/02/opinion/biden-climate-policy.html">raised concerns</a> about the broad scope of Biden&#8217;s climate change policies and the associated high costs. Tackling climate change under Bidenomics is projected to cost approximately $400 billion, and some individuals believe that economic prosperity and climate change are unrelated.</p>
<p>Many critics assert that Bidenomics has proven unsuccessful for the United States thus far, and they advocate for an alternative approach. Biden&#8217;s approval rating currently stands at <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-poll-harris-survey-economy-354924a2ed1e4833668a2554f12c7f9f">41%</a>, with only <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-poll-economy-survey-jobs-inflation-b3c77cb208f96f9b039cf48cbc4fb67b">34% of Americans</a> believing that he is effectively managing the economy. In an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/07/03/biden-economy-not-working-me/">opinion editorial</a> published in The Washington Post, one author contends that &#8220;Bidenomics&#8221; is ineffective. The author points out that a front-page article on June 29 presented a summary of the U.S. president&#8217;s plan, but neither the Biden administration nor newspapers address the concerns that occupy voters&#8217; minds during polls.</p>

The move came as the global cryptocurrency market was mostly in the green, despite the lower than usual market volume. Polygon also hit a multi-week high.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>)</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>) climbed to a ten-day high on Tuesday, despite the market volume being low as a result of Independence Day in the United States.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>/USD rose to a peak of $0.3009 earlier in the session, which comes a day after dropping to a bottom at $0.2917.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Following today&#x2019;s rally, cardano jumped to its highest level since June 25, when the token was above $0.305.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As seen on the chart, Tuesday&#x2019;s move pushed <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a> marginally above a ceiling of $0.295, however bears have rejected a full breakout.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The token is now hovering close to this point, with the relative strength index (RSI) below a ceiling of its own at 51.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Price strength is currently at a reading of 49.91, after earlier momentum faded.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>Polygon (MATIC)</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Polygon (MATIC) remained near a four-week high in today&#x2019;s session, following a five-day bulls run.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
MATIC/USD bulls pushed the price to a peak of $0.7193 late on Monday, with traders consolidating these gains today.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The token dropped to an intraday low of $0.6829 earlier in the session, after reaching its strongest point since mid-June the day prior.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
One of the catalysts of the drop appears to be a collision with a ceiling at 55.00, which is on the RSI indicator.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
At the time of writing this, the index is now at a reading of 51.60, which is marginally above floor at 51.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Should this floor fail to hold in the coming days, it is likely that more bears will reenter the market.&#13;<br />
