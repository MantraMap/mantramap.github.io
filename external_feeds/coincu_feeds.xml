<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Cathie Wood thinks Binance&#8217;s current troubles will be an advantage for Coinbase.</em></li>



<li><em>This makes it possible for Coinbase to eliminate the strongest competitor in the market.</em></li>



<li><em>While both of the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchanges face an SEC lawsuit for allegedly selling unregistered securities, she said Coinbase has the upper hand.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to Bloomberg, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood said in an interview that Binance&#8217;s regulatory issues in the United States would benefit Coinbase as it would eliminate its main competitor.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-517.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="648" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-517.png" alt="image 517" class="wp-image-193127" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-517.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-517-300x190.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-517-768x486.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-517-750x475.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Cathie Wood: Binance&#039;s Legal Troubles Will Help Coinbase Eliminate Competitors 2"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>According to Cathie Wood, this is an opportune time for Coinbase to eliminate its most potent competitor in the market.</p>



<p>&#8220;We have Binance under increasing regulatory scrutiny for more criminal activities, fraud being one of them, therefore we have the competition for Coinbase disappearing, so that&#8217;s a good thing longer term for Coinbase.&#8221; Wood told Bloomberg Television on Thursday.</p>



<p>Wood said Coinbase has not been accused of any criminal activity, and most of the other allegations on Binance have nothing to do with Coinbase. </p>



<p>The SEC has accused Binance and Coinbase of operating unregistered exchanges and offering unregistered securities, including Binance&#8217;s digital assets: BNB and stablecoin Binance USD (BUSD).</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-516.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="700" height="394" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-516.png" alt="Cathie Wood: Binance&#039;s Legal Troubles Will Help Coinbase Eliminate Competitors" class="wp-image-193126" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-516.png 700w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-516-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" title="Cathie Wood: Binance&#039;s Legal Troubles Will Help Coinbase Eliminate Competitors 3"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>As for Binance, however, the US Financial Supervisory Authority has accused cryptocurrency exchange Binance and its founder <a href="https://news.coincu.com/193118-cz-receives-summons-in-battle-with-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Changpeng Zhao</a> of operating a &#8220;scam website&#8221;, accusing him and his exchange on 13 counts.</p>



<p>&#8220;There are questions about what&#8217;s a security, about staking, those are the two questions that Coinbase and Binance are facing, but most of the other questions about Binance have nothing to do with Coinbase.&#8221;</p>



<p>Wood also said she remains confident in Bitcoin&#8217;s $1 million target. The more uncertain and volatile the global economy is, the more Ark believes in Bitcoin. The company asserts that Bitcoin&#8217;s position is increasing amid fears of inflation, and this will boost the Bitcoin supply chain. Bitcoin works well in this situation as it is the antidote to counterparty risk in the traditional financial system.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Binance crypto executive Changpeng Zhao (CZ) said he had received a summons from the Washington District Court.</em></li>



<li><em>This is only part of the SEC compliance process.</em></li>



<li><em>He does not need to appear in person and will have 21 days to respond and comply with the summons.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to a personal Twitter post by Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ), he has received a summons from the Washington District Court. This order was issued in the context of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) having filed a lawsuit against Binance exchange two days earlier.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-514.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="660" height="440" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-514.png" alt="CZ Receives Summons From Washington County Court In Battle With SEC" class="wp-image-193121" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-514.png 660w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-514-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" title="CZ Receives Summons From Washington County Court In Battle With SEC 6"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Furthermore, a paragraph in the court order also states that CZ needs to be summoned because &#8220;a new lawsuit filed against CZ&#8221; exists. This confirmed the summons to be related to recent SEC action.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>According to the Binance director, this is only part of the SEC compliance process, stating that he will not have to appear in person. He would have 21 days to respond and comply with the summons.</p>



<p>The crypto market has been flooded with unexpected news in the last two days. Specifically, the two largest crypto exchanges in the market, Binance, and Coinbase, have faced legal action from the SEC for violating US securities laws.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-515.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="620" height="349" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-515.png" alt="CZ Receives Summons From Washington County Court In Battle With SEC" class="wp-image-193122" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-515.png 620w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-515-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" title="CZ Receives Summons From Washington County Court In Battle With SEC 7"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>On June 5, the US Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit against Binance with 13 allegations. One of the allegations in the lawsuit alleges that funds from Binance and Binance.US were mixed into an account controlled by Merit Peak Limited involving Changpeng Zhao.</p>



<p>Another allegation is that <a href="https://news.coincu.com/192971-us-court-sec-binance-us-subsidiaries/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance.US</a> conducted money laundering transactions through a secret Market Maker (MM) called Sigma Chain, also owned by CZ. Thereby, the SEC filed a court application to freeze the assets of Binance US. Then one day, the SEC also sued Coinbase for the same reason.</p>



<p>Following the lawsuits, more than 61 coins were classified as securities by the SEC. In response, the Binance side objected, and a statement that it is ready to fight the SEC in the lawsuit while always complying with US laws. Coinbase has also taken similar action.</p>

<li><em>The action comes after the Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States sued Binance on June 5, saying that the company committed breaches that should ban the exchange and its CEO from doing further business in the United States.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Binance.US, the U.S. arm of the crypto exchange Binance, said on Wednesday that it has chosen to suspend its over-the-counter trading service.</strong></h5>

<p>The exchange also announced the suspension of its OTC Trading Portal, an &#8220;over-the-counter&#8221; trading method that allows buyers and sellers to trade without the use of a public order book.</p>



<p>Binance has been in the news for three days in a row. On June 5, the SEC filed a complaint against the crypto exchange&#8217;s US subsidiary.</p>



<p>On June 5, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a complaint against Binance and billionaire Changpeng Zhao (CZ) in federal court in Washington, outlining 13 accusations. According to the SEC, Binance overstated trade volumes, steered client money, did not exclude Americans from the platform, and deceived investors about its market control procedures.</p>



<p>On Monday, the US regulator said that Zhao and his exchange tried to circumvent &#8220;their own controls&#8221; in order to let high-net-worth US investors and clients continue trading on Binance&#8217;s unregulated international exchange.</p>



<p>According to the lawsuit, Binance established Binance.US as a shield for the main corporation and Zhao in order to &#8220;reveal, retard, and resolve&#8221; law enforcement targets and insulate Binance.</p>

<p>The SEC stated that two consecutive Binance.US CEOs voiced grave worry about Zhao&#8217;s degree of control. Both testified before federal regulators: While neither was identified, the company&#8217;s first and second CEOs were Catherine Coley and Brian Brooks.</p>



<p>The SEC then attempted to freeze the exchange&#8217;s assets on June 6.</p>



<p>Together with the announcement, Binance.US provided the following list of trading pairings. Additionally, the article indicated that client money is secure and that deposits and withdrawals would continue to work regularly for all customers.</p>



<p>There has been a lot of FUD in the market as a result of the current SEC mess and the developments surrounding Binance. The CEO of Binance, CZ, went to Twitter to refute one such circulating story.</p>

In the past 24h, BNB fell by more than 6% to about $259.</p>



<p>The attack occurred in October 2022, when the hacker targeted the BNB Chain cross-chain bridge, earning 2 million BNB and staking 920,000 BNB on Venus to lend about $150m in stablecoins. </p>



<p>According to Binance&#8217;s BNB Chain blog, hackers drained 2 million BNB tokens from the network on October 6, which is about $518 million at current prices. </p>

<p>CEO Changpeng Zhao had said the exploit was on a cross-chain bridge, BSC Token Hub, which created extra BNB tokens out of thin air. A cross-chain bridge lets users port their digital assets from one blockchain to another. The BSC Token Hub is a bridge between the BNB Beacon Chain (BEP2) and the BNB Chain (BEP20 or BSC). </p>



<p>However, according to Venus VIP-79, only BNBChain can liquidate the position of the hacker 0x489, and the actual liquidation may not necessarily occur after the liquidation is triggered.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>SushiSwap had integrated the V3 product suite on Avalanche.</em></li>



<li><em>This integration includes three major functions: a centralized liquidity pool, SushiXSwap, and a new DEX aggregator.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>SushiSwap <a href="https://www.sushi.com/blog/sushi-v3-live-on-avax" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that it had integrated the V3 product suite on Avalanche.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-508-1024x576.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-508-1024x576.png" alt="SushiSwap Announces Integration Of V3 Product Suite On Avalanche" class="wp-image-193097" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-508-1024x576.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-508-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-508-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-508-1536x864.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-508-750x422.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-508-1140x641.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-508.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="SushiSwap Announces Integration Of V3 Product Suite On Avalanche 18"></a></figure></div>


<p>This integration includes three major functions: a concentrated liquidity pool, a cross-chain trading platform SushiXSwap, and a new DEX aggregator.</p>



<p>The new v3 release&#8217;s main feature is concentrated liquidity pools, which enable users to contribute liquidity and collect incentives in the most effective manner possible. They operate by dividing the price curve of a certain pair into intervals, resulting in a distinct price curve in each interval that swings dependent on the amount of liquidity available in that interval or price range. This concept enables liquidity providers (LPs) to distribute their money based on their chosen price range, allowing LPs complete discretion over when and where their position will likely generate fees.</p>



<p>SushiXSwap, the LayerZero Stargate-based cross-chain communications mechanism. Sushi users may use it to perform swaps across various chains, abstracting away any extra procedures (bridging money, leveraging several protocols, switching into the local currency, etc.) into a single user-friendly interface. To use SushiXSwap, users just toggle cross-chain swaps and pick Avalanche as the source or destination chain.</p>



<p>Lastly, the new <a href="https://news.coincu.com/192441-sushiswap-launches-dex-aggregator/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DEX aggregator</a> intends to provide customers with the best prices for their swaps by combining several DEXs, consolidating liquidity, and creating a larger pool against which users may trade.</p>



<p>SushiSwap is essentially an automated market maker (AMM) that enables peer-to-peer cryptocurrency trading in the decentralized finance space.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The Taiko Layer 2 Ethereum Network has launched an alpha-3 test network.</em></li>



<li><em>The alpha-3 test network&#8217;s primary purpose is to evaluate the economic design and implementation of new protocols, including new fee/reward structures.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ethereum Layer 2 network Taiko has <a href="https://taiko.mirror.xyz/wD7yN8Y5RttbP7kzdtX22GbMg6i18a-Xwet2sshpt48" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched</a> the alpha-3 testnet, Grímsvötn.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-503-1024x536.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="536" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-503-1024x536.png" alt="Taiko Launches Alpha-3 Testnet To Complete New Protocol Economics Design" class="wp-image-193087" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-503-1024x536.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-503-300x157.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-503-768x402.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-503-750x393.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-503-1140x597.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-503.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Taiko Launches Alpha-3 Testnet To Complete New Protocol Economics Design 22"></a></figure></div>


<p>This is the next stage toward a decentralized, Ethereum-equivalent ZK-EVM, and it will be important in testing much of the network architecture and components.</p>



<p>Relative to alpha-2, the most prominent changes are new protocol economics design and implementation; proposers AND provers are permissionless (alpha-1 had permissionless proposers, alpha-2 had permissionless provers), and Layer-3 implementation: inception layers.</p>



<p>Alpha-3 will be an incentive testnet to achieve the purpose of evaluating the new protocol economics design. The network will test how permissionless proposers and provers behave in a manner-simulated environment, where people behave rationally in accordance with the protocol&#8217;s costs and incentives. Due to the absence of real-value assets, simulating a mainnet environment with permissionless economic activity is more difficult on a testnet.</p>

<p><a href="https://news.coincu.com/189473-taiko-zkevm-solution-high-compatibility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taiko</a> is a blockchain built on zkEVM technology that is Fully Ethereum-equivalent ZK-Rollup. It is currently Layer 2 going in the direction of Type 1 ZK-EVM, which is also the type with the highest level of EVM compatibility.</p>



<p>Type 1 ZK-EVM that Taiko is applying for works fully compatible with Ethereum. This makes it possible for developers to seamlessly migrate DApps between Ethereum and Taiko without risking contract failures (versus having to compile them into another language). Thereby shortening the time to reprogram old features and giving more resources to develop other breakthrough features if the project on Ethereum wants to scale operations on Taiko and vice versa.</p>



<p>The Taiko Protocol defines and enforces Rollup&#8217;s rules and finds potential participants. Taiko is designed to uphold the core principles of decentralization and security.</p>



<p>Smart contracts deployed on Ethereum serve as the data delivery mechanism and verifier of ZK-SNARK proofs. The smart contract deployed on Taiko performs several important functions, such as reusing the programmability of the EVM to enforce certain protocol properties.</p>

<p>Tendermint Core, the Cosmos-SDK, IBC, and the Cosmos Proof of Stake modules comprise the Cosmos technology stack, which is an industry-leading Go toolkit for creating, deploying, and operating blockchains. Now, this technique is being utilized to safeguard billions of dollars in crypto market value.</p>



<p>Informal Systems has been instrumental in building technology that supports blockchains in the Cosmos ecosystem, notably the Cosmos Hub. It contributed to the development of Interchain Security, a method enabling blockchains to rely on the Cosmos Hub for security rather than operating their own sets of validators.</p>



<p>The company also has a project called Collaborative Finance that aims to combine Cosmos technology with financial products to deliver company liquidity platforms. It intends to elaborate on its objectives in a future whitepaper.</p>

<p>Hong Kong&#8217;s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) recently expressed its support for the use of tokenisation in the financial industry. Elizabeth Wong, head of the financial technology department of the SFC, said that the commission will continue to amend and evolve policies for better access to cryptocurrency investments. </p>



<p>The SFC has already provided certain regulatory oversight and investor protection to licensed virtual-asset platforms. Wong added that the SFC will apply the same code of conduct to fund managers looking to invest portfolios in virtual assets. Blockchain technology can ensure or enhance efficiency, according to Wong. </p>



<p>The watchdog is actively looking into the benefits of tokenisation while also ensuring that investors are not any worse off. Cybersecurity is the biggest concern for the SFC, ensuring that the token is free from hacking and has no vulnerabilities. The commission is keen to understand these challenges and is open to working with industry players. </p>

<p>This sentiment is shared by Brit Blakeney, senior vice-president of digital strategy and wealth management in Asia at Franklin Templeton Investments, who said that the industry has only scratched the surface regarding the potential of blockchain and tokenisation. Franklin Templeton is currently focused on a digital assets strategy and plans to grow its focus and presence in digital assets. The American asset manager in April announced a US-registered mutual fund that uses Polygon blockchain to process transactions and record share ownership.</p>

<p>Users may perform BRC-20 and Bitcoin NFT transactions by visiting the OKX Web3 Wallet Ordinals Market. The market is a decentralized trading platform that accepts APP and online transactions with no transaction fees.</p>



<p>OKX Wallet is the first decentralized, multi-chain wallet that enables online and mobile users to trade Bitcoin (BTC) NFTs, see and transfer Bitcoin ordinals, and trade BRC-20 tokens across 60+ blockchains using a single solution. It is also the first multi-chain wallet with no trade commission costs and batch listing capabilities.</p>



<p>OKX was a long-time backer of Bitcoin, including the Lightning Network into its controlled exchange more than two years ago. The initial BRC-20 browser was published before, and the BRC-30 standard proposal was presented to enable a BTC ecosystem pledge mechanism.</p>



<p>OKX Wallet&#8217;s Ordinals Market now has a new &#8216;Bitcoin NFTs&#8217; page, allowing users to buy, sell, and transfer inscriptions. Users may also see their assets via OKX Wallet&#8217;s main tab, with ordinals displaying under the NFT sub-tab.</p>

<p>The OKX Wallet is the first multi-chain Web3 wallet that uses multi-party computation (MPC) technology, which increases security by removing a single point of failure and makes it simpler for users to regain access to assets in an emergency. All transactions and tokens are on-chain as a genuinely decentralized, self-custody wallet, according to the Bitcoin idea of &#8216;not your keys, not your coins.&#8217;</p>



<p>As Coincu <a href="https://news.coincu.com/192443-okx-wallet-support-account-abstraction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, OKX Wallet will also support the Account Abstraction feature, turning users&#8217; wallets into &#8220;Smart Accounts&#8221; in the coming weeks.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cumberland withdrew 20k and 4.8k ETH and other tokens from Coinbase and Binance. They also moved millions of USDC and BUSD amid market changes. Wu reports high premiums for BTC, ETH, and BNB on Binance U.S.</strong></h5>



<p>According to Lookonchain, Cumberland withdrew about 20,000 and 4,850 ETH from Coinbase and Binance, respectively, as well as other tokens such as AXS, SHIB, COMP, LINK, CRV, and AAVE. This followed the announcement that Cumberland had halted trading of Firecoin, which had been classified as a security token by the SEC.</p>

<p>Despite these challenges, Cumberland appeared to have taken advantage of the situation and bought at a low point. This was evident when they withdrew 20,000 ETH($37M) from #Coinbase and 4,850 ETH($9M) from Binance, and also withdrew AXS, SHIB, COMP, LINK, CRV, AAVE, and RNDR.</p>



<p>In addition to these moves, Cumberland also withdrew a significant amount of USD Coin (USDC) from Circle, depositing roughly $85M USDC to Coinbase and $3.5M USDC to Binance after the recent lawsuits by the SEC against Binance and Coinbase.</p>



<p>Moreover, Nansen <a href="https://pro.nansen.ai/exchange-flows/transactions?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=partnership&amp;utm_campaign=wublockchain_23" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://pro.nansen.ai/exchange-flows/transactions?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=partnership&amp;utm_campaign=wublockchain_23" rel="noreferrer noopener">data </a>showed that in the past 24 hours, Cumberland withdrew over 23 million BUSD from Binance and transferred them all to Paxos. These actions demonstrate that Cumberland has responded proactively and agile to market conditions.</p>
