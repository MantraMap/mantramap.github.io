<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Coinbase Listing Approval Not a Guarantee: The US SEC clarifies that approving Coinbase&#8217;s S-1 listing application does not imply regulatory compliance or serve as a &#8220;talisman&#8221; for the company&#8217;s business structure.</em></li>



<li><em>Regulatory Requirements Remain: The SEC emphasizes that the approval process does not assess specific assets or provide assurance that they won&#8217;t be considered securities in the future, highlighting the ongoing legal dispute between Coinbase and the SEC.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The US Securities and Exchange Commission declared that Coinbase listing clearance is not a &#8220;talisman&#8221; and does not indicate if the company meets regulatory criteria.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/resize_Coinbase-SEC-1.png"><img decoding="async" width="800" height="450" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/resize_Coinbase-SEC-1.png" alt="US SEC Clarifies Coinbase Listing Approval, Stresses Regulatory Requirements" class="wp-image-203029" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/resize_Coinbase-SEC-1.png 800w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/resize_Coinbase-SEC-1-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/resize_Coinbase-SEC-1-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/resize_Coinbase-SEC-1-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" title="US SEC Clarifies Coinbase Listing Approval, Stresses Regulatory Requirements 1"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has emphasized that approving a company&#8217;s S-1 listing application does not serve as a &#8220;talisman&#8221; and does not determine compliance with regulatory requirements. Court documents from the SEC v. Coinbase case reveal the SEC&#8217;s argument during a recent pre-motion hearing on July 13. The SEC stated that approving Coinbase&#8217;s listing in April 2021 did not signify approval of its business structure.</p>



<p>SEC attorney Peter Mancuso clarified that granting permission for a company to go public does not imply recognition of its underlying business or structure, nor does it guarantee compliance with legal regulations. Mancuso stated, &#8220;S-1 approval cannot be the company&#8217;s entire business talisman. In fact, there is no evidence that the SEC reviewed specific assets and made a specific determination assuring Coinbase that these assets would not be considered securities in the future.&#8221;</p>

<p>Previously, the SEC had accused <a href="https://coincu.com/202704-coinbase-relisted-xrp-as-market-value-jumps/">Coinbase</a> of engaging in unregistered securities offerings since 2019. Coinbase is seeking an early dismissal of the case based on several grounds, including the argument that the SEC was informed in detail about the company&#8217;s business structure and planned activities prior to its initial public offering (IPO).</p>



<p>The SEC&#8217;s clarification highlights the distinction between listing approval and regulatory compliance. While the firm obtained approval for its listing, the SEC stresses that this approval does not guarantee the legality of the company&#8217;s underlying business structure or activities. The ongoing legal dispute between Coinbase and the SEC underlines the complexity of regulatory requirements in the cryptocurrency industry.</p>



<p>As the case unfolds, it will have implications for the regulatory landscape surrounding digital assets and could potentially shape the future regulatory approach to crypto-related companies. It emphasizes the importance for companies operating in the crypto space to proactively engage with regulatory authorities and ensure compliance with existing regulations.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Coinbase has suspended its staking service in California, New Jersey, South Carolina, and Wisconsin.</em></li>



<li><em>The action comes after these states said they would request changes to those services while proceedings against those betting services proceed.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Coinbase has officially written that, on June 6, 10 US states have initiated lawsuits related to the platform&#8217;s <a href="https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/coinbase-staking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">staking</a> service.</strong></h5>

<p>The vast majority of the exchange&#8217;s customers are unaffected. Still, the exchange has requested restrictions on its retail mortgage services pending the completion of proceedings in California, New Jersey, and South America. Carolina and Wisconsin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Four of the states – CA, NJ, SC, and WI – have required restrictions to our retail staking services before their state proceedings are complete, even though our staking services have been available safely and transparently for years.&#8221;</p>



<p>Restricting staking will not benefit local residents. It will only limit these residents from participating in and benefiting from the crypto economy. But Coinbase will follow the orders of the states during the litigation.</p>



<p>The exchange also asserts that almost all significant blockchains today rely on staking because it is open, secure, and environmentally friendly. Americans in every state deserve the same economic and technological opportunities.</p>

<p>The SEC filed a lawsuit against Coinbase last month, classifying its staking service, as well as some of the tokens it lists as securities. That same day, securities authorities in ten states began proceedings on this crypto exchange. Since then, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US has always taken action to deny all accusations of this regulator.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/202704-coinbase-relisted-xrp-as-market-value-jumps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ripple&#8217;s</a> recent partial victory when the US Court ruled that trading its XRP token on cryptocurrency exchanges did not violate securities laws has brought good news to the crypto industry and Coinbase.</p>



<p>The event is considered to weaken the SEC&#8217;s earlier charges against two exchanges, Coinbase and Binance. The community also expects a new legal framework.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon, Multichain officially <a href="https://coincu.com/202911-multichain-ceo-disappears-with-user-assets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that the Chinese police had confiscated the computer, hardware wallet, phone, and keys of CEO Zhaojun.

<p>As a result, when this CEO was arrested, the transaction signing process could not be done, leading to the project being unable to fix the recent technical vulnerabilities.</p>



<p>The project also said that all operating funds and user assets are under the control of Mr. Zhaojun and are being placed under the control of the Chinese police.</p>



<p>The team also explained that they did not disclose Mr. Zhaojun&#8217;s arrest for several weeks because of the host country&#8217;s laws. In the early days of the rumors, the team shared the force majeure situation to announce the inability to contact the CEO.</p>



<p>Multichain was hacked with a total loss of 130 million USD, negatively affecting the DeFi ecosystem on Fantom. A lot of users on Fantom were severely affected.

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>BlockFi&#8217;s creditors have accused the platform&#8217;s management of ignoring risk warnings to expose FTX and Alameda Research.</em></li>



<li><em>BlockFi had about $1.2 billion in assets tied to FTX and Alameda when the company declared bankruptcy.</em></li>



<li><em>Director Zac Prince is said to have dismissed the group&#8217;s concerns about lending Alameda $217 million in August 2021.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>BlockFi&#8217;s demise stemmed from the company leaders ignoring warnings about potential risks associated with FTX and Alameda Research, as revealed in documents <a href="/Users/Admin/Downloads/bf666dfd-142a-4632-aba1-83acf09fbc4a.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed</a> on July 14.</strong></h5>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-14/blockfi-management-dismissed-ftx-warnings-creditors-allege" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a>, BlockFi&#8217;s creditor committee said in a newly published report that this crypto lender executives ignored their risk management team&#8217;s repeated warnings about not granting large loans to Alameda Research.</p>



<p>The report attributed the failure of BlockFi to the fault of CEO Zac Prince and other senior executives. The creditors&#8217; findings were published on Friday.</p>



<p>The commission said that as early as August 2021, the crypto lender had a copy of Alameda&#8217;s balance sheet showing that the company relies heavily on FTT, a digital token created by FTX. Alameda&#8217;s overreliance on FTT &#8220;has raised alarm bells at BlockFi,&#8221; but Prince ignored those concerns.</p>



<p>The report quoted Prince as saying in an email that Alameda represents &#8220;the biggest/most obvious growth opportunity we have.&#8221;</p>



<p>In addition to being accused of ignoring warning signs from FTX, the commission also stated that BlockFi&#8217;s business is &#8220;fundamentally flawed&#8221; as it needs riskier investment partners to turn a profit high for customers.</p>



<p>This means that BlockFi can only do business with a few companies, such as Alameda, that can turn a profit high enough. And just a few days ago, BlockFi released its investigative report, saying that management conducted due diligence before providing loans to FTX.</p>

<p>The failed crypto lender had approximately $1.2 billion in assets tied to FTX and Alameda Research when it filed for bankruptcy in November 2022.</p>



<p>The lending platform directly cited FTX exposure as the reason for filing for bankruptcy. FTX&#8217;s FTT token-based mortgage lending has left many companies on the hook after the token price fell from more than $25 to less than $2 amid Chapter 11 filings and reporting issues.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Binance has laid off more than 1,000 employees worldwide in recent weeks.</em></li>



<li><em>The layoffs, which could range from 1,500 to 3,000 employees worldwide, last until the end of the year.</em></li>



<li><em>The cause is speculated to be that the world&#8217;s leading exchange is struggling in a legal battle with the SEC.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/binance-lays-off-over-1-000-employees-d59ff6ad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wall Street Journal</a>, citing a source, due to regulatory investigations by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulatory challenges, cryptocurrency exchange Binance has fired more than 1,000 people employees worldwide in recent weeks.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1016-1024x536.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="536" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1016-1024x536.png" alt="Binance Has Fired Over 1,000 People In Recent Weeks: Report" class="wp-image-202998" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1016-1024x536.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1016-300x157.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1016-768x402.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1016-750x393.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1016-1140x597.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1016.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Binance Has Fired Over 1,000 People In Recent Weeks: Report 9"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>According to sources, more than a third of Binance employees (about 8,000 people in total before layoffs) could eventually be affected by layoffs. A spokesperson for Binance confirmed the layoffs to The Wall Street Journal but did not disclose the number.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;As we prepare for the next major bull market cycle, we clearly need to focus on talent density across the organization to ensure we stay agile and dynamic,&#8221;</p>
<cite>The spokesperson said.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Additionally, CNBC quoted a current Binance employee familiar with the company&#8217;s plans as saying that the layoffs will eventually lay off 1,500 to 3,000 employees worldwide and that the layoffs will continue through the end of the year. Although CEO Changpeng Zhao previously shared that the company is still recruiting</p>



<p>CNBC attributed the layoffs to the US Department of Justice&#8217;s ongoing investigation into Binance, citing current employees saying the investigation could end with a consent order or an agreement on billions of dollars worth of deals. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao tweeted, adding that the exchange is &#8220;still hiring.&#8221;</p>

<p>Last month, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)<a href="https://coincu.com/202868-binanceus-responds-to-ripples-crazy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> sued</a> Binance and Director Changpeng Zhao for allegedly operating a &#8220;scam website.&#8221; Then, a lengthy Justice Department investigation into the company was also launched into its founder and chief executive officer.</p>



<p>It can be seen that Binance has taken decisive actions against the allegations to confirm the trust with users, but more or less top exchanges are still affected by the legal battle with crypto-biased regulators.</p>

<p>With the Web3 Rewards Tools app, brands can issue token-based rewards, leveraging the benefits of blockchain technology to enhance customer engagement.

<p>Co:Create&#8217;s application aims to onboard more brands into the web3 rewards ecosystem, enabling them to leverage the power of blockchain and NFTs to create immersive loyalty experiences for their customers. While Co:Create is an innovator in this space, it&#8217;s worth noting that other platforms have also ventured into bringing web3 rewards to Shopify. In March, Try Your Best (TYB), a community engagement platform built on the Avalanche network, launched its application on the Shopify app store. This integration provided brands with the opportunity to implement NFT-based loyalty programs seamlessly within their Shopify storefronts.</p>



<p>By integrating blockchain technology into loyalty and rewards programs, businesses can unlock new possibilities for customer engagement and loyalty. The utilization of NFTs and gamified experiences adds a layer of excitement and exclusivity, enhancing brand loyalty and customer retention.</p>



<p>Co:Create&#8217;s launch of the Web3 Rewards Tools app on Shopify, powered by Polygon, signifies a significant step forward in the adoption of blockchain-based loyalty solutions. As more brands embrace the potential of web3 rewards ecosystems, we can expect to see a transformation in customer loyalty programs, providing unique and immersive experiences for shoppers.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>SHIB Burning Rate Soars: Shiba Inu&#8217;s burning rate (SHIB) experiences a significant surge of 2000%, with 31.7 million SHIB burned in the past 24 hours, contributing to increased network activity.</em></li>



<li><em>XRP Boost and Resistance Challenges: SHIB benefits from XRP&#8217;s bullish momentum, but struggles to break resistance at $0.000008. The upcoming launch of Shibarium holds potential for price growth, though an exact release date remains uncertain.</em></li>

<p>In the past 24 hours, a massive burn of 31.7 million SHIB was sent to dead wallets, contributing to this surge in burning activity. The reasons behind the sudden spike in burn numbers could be attributed to heightened network activity or a comparatively lower burn rate on the previous day. Interestingly, this surge in SHIB burning coincides with the positive impact of recent news from XRP, as SHIB has capitalized on the bullish momentum generated by XRP.</p>



<p>The recent US court ruling that declared XRP not as a security has caused excitement in the cryptocurrency industry. As a result, XRP has surged by 66.5% within the past 24 hours, surpassing other Altcoins in terms of trading volume. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is benefiting from this bullish wave, as it has experienced a 5.2% increase in the last 24 hours and a 9.1% gain in the weekly chart.</p>

<p>However, despite the ongoing rally, <a href="https://coincu.com/197113-shiba-inu-takes-nfts-to-the-next-level/">SHIB</a> is encountering resistance in breaking above the $0.000008 mark. Although it briefly surpassed this level earlier, it struggled to maintain its position. Notably, data from IntoTheBlock reveals that a significant amount of SHIBs, totaling 24 trillion, were purchased just below the current price level. Therefore, it becomes crucial for SHIB to sustain or increase its value from here. A drop below the current levels could potentially lead to intensified selling pressure, posing risks for the token.</p>



<p>While Shiba Inu has faced challenges in surpassing key resistance levels, the anticipated launch of the Shibarium layer-2 solution holds promise for driving up SHIB&#8217;s price. However, an exact release date for Shibarium remains speculative, with suggestions pointing to an August launch.</p>



<p>In summary, the remarkable surge in the SHIB burning rate, coupled with the positive impact of XRP&#8217;s bullish wave, presents an intriguing landscape for Shiba Inu (SHIB). As the token faces resistance in breaking key price levels, all eyes remain on the upcoming Shibarium launch as a potential catalyst for further price movement.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>US SEC acknowledges Bitcoin ETF applications from BlackRock, Fidelity, WisdomTree, VanEck, and Invesco, initiating the review process.</em></li>



<li><em>The inclusion of surveillance-sharing agreements in filings aims to address market manipulation concerns and increase the chances of approval.</em></li>



<li><em>Approval of Bitcoin ETFs would attract institutional and retail investors, reshape cryptocurrency investments, and set a precedent for future regulatory frameworks.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a significant development for the cryptocurrency industry, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has <a href="https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1679863731952525314" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acknowledged</a> several applications for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from prominent financial institutions, including BlackRock, Fidelity, WisdomTree, VanEck, and Invesco.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ds-min.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ds-min-1024x683.jpg" alt="SEC Now Acknowledges BlackRock And Prominent Institutions For Bitcoin ETF" class="wp-image-202982" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ds-min-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ds-min-300x200.jpg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ds-min-768x512.jpg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ds-min-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ds-min-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ds-min-750x500.jpg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ds-min-1140x761.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="SEC Now Acknowledges BlackRock And Prominent Institutions For Bitcoin ETF 15"></a></figure></div>


<p>This acknowledgment signifies the beginning of the review process, which is expected to take around 240 days, during which the SEC will thoroughly evaluate the applications and make a decision on their approval or denial. This crucial step brings the race for the first US Bitcoin ETF one step closer to fruition and has the potential to reshape the landscape of cryptocurrency investments. Previously, the SEC <a href="https://coincu.com/202636-sec-now-reviews-bitwise-bitcoin-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recognized</a> Bitwise’s application for a spot Bitcoin ETF product.</p>



<p>The inclusion of established asset management firms like <a href="https://coincu.com/198667-ark-invest-blackrock-locked-in-showdown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BlackRock</a> and <a href="https://coincu.com/202622-fidelity-fires-up-bitcoin-etf-race/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fidelity</a> among the applicants underscores the growing interest and acceptance of cryptocurrencies within traditional financial circles.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1014.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="600" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1014.png" alt="SEC Now Acknowledges BlackRock And Prominent Institutions For Bitcoin ETF" class="wp-image-202978" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1014.png 1000w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1014-300x180.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1014-768x461.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1014-750x450.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" title="SEC Now Acknowledges BlackRock And Prominent Institutions For Bitcoin ETF 16"></a></figure></div>


<p>The prospect of Bitcoin ETFs has long been anticipated as a means to bridge the gap between digital assets and mainstream investors, offering a regulated and accessible investment vehicle for Bitcoin. While the acknowledgment from the SEC is a positive development, it is important to note that it does not guarantee approval at this stage, and the ultimate decision rests with the regulatory body.</p>



<p>One of the key concerns for the SEC has been the potential for market manipulation in the cryptocurrency space. To address this issue, the applicants have made concerted efforts to incorporate surveillance-sharing agreements in their filings. These agreements aim to provide enhanced oversight and monitoring of the underlying Bitcoin markets, thereby mitigating the risk of fraudulent activities. The inclusion of such measures demonstrates the applicants&#8217; commitment to maintaining market integrity and could potentially increase the likelihood of approval by the SEC.</p>

<p>The decision on Bitcoin ETFs holds significant implications for the cryptocurrency industry and broader financial markets. Approval of these ETFs would open the doors for institutional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin in a regulated and secure manner, potentially attracting billions of dollars in new investments. It would also provide retail investors with a more accessible avenue to participate in the cryptocurrency market, as ETFs are widely recognized and familiar investment instruments.</p>



<p>While the review process is underway, the cryptocurrency community and market participants eagerly await the SEC&#8217;s decision. The outcome will not only impact the applicants but also set a precedent for future cryptocurrency ETFs and the overall regulatory framework for digital assets. The acknowledgment of these applications by the SEC marks a significant milestone in the journey toward mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies and highlights the increasing recognition of Bitcoin as a legitimate investment asset class.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>BlackRock CEO predicts rising interest in cryptocurrencies among gold investors.</em></li>



<li><em>Fink sees crypto as an international asset with unique value.</em></li>



<li><em>BlackRock&#8217;s spot Bitcoin ETF filing signals a potential shift in SEC approval.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>BlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently shared his positive outlook on cryptocurrencies during an appearance on <em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/14/blackrock-has-a-responsibility-to-democratize-investing-including-in-crypto-larry-fink-says.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNBC</a></em>.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1010.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1010-1024x576.png" alt="BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Makes Bold Prediction For Cryptocurrencies&#039; Global Rise" class="wp-image-202969" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1010-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1010-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1010-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1010-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1010-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1010.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Makes Bold Prediction For Cryptocurrencies&#039; Global Rise 18"></a></figure></div>


<p>Fink noted the growing demand for digital assets among gold investors and highlighted the role of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in democratizing access to gold. He suggested that ETFs could play a similar role in the cryptocurrency market.</p>



<p>Describing crypto as an <a href="https://coincu.com/200412-blackrock-ceo-praises-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">international asset</a>, Fink emphasized its differentiating value compared to other asset classes. He expressed belief in the potential of cryptocurrencies to transcend national currencies, citing the depreciation of the US dollar and the global interest in digital assets. Fink noted that BlackRock is witnessing increasing interest in crypto, which is broad-based and worldwide.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/199918-blackrock-chooses-coinbase-surveillance-partner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BlackRock</a>, an $8.5 trillion asset management company, recently filed an application for a spot Bitcoin ETF. The filing includes a surveillance-sharing agreement, which could be a crucial factor in the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) finally approving such a product. The SEC has previously rejected numerous Bitcoin ETF applications.</p>



<p>Fink emphasized BlackRock&#8217;s commitment to safety and security in new markets. He stated that if the company&#8217;s name is associated with a product, they will ensure it is safe and protected. The company believes in democratizing investing and recognizes the transformative role of ETFs. Fink sees this as just the beginning of ETFs&#8217; impact on the investment landscape.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1011.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1011-1024x683.png" alt="BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Makes Bold Prediction For Cryptocurrencies&#039; Global Rise" class="wp-image-202970" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1011-1024x683.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1011-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1011-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1011-750x500.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1011-1140x760.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1011.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Makes Bold Prediction For Cryptocurrencies&#039; Global Rise 19"></a></figure></div>


<p>While Fink did not directly discuss the spot Bitcoin ETF filing, he mentioned that BlackRock is working with regulators and is dedicated to maintaining a safe and sound environment. The involvement of a prominent asset management firm like BlackRock and the proposed surveillance-sharing agreement indicate a potential shift in momentum toward Bitcoin ETF approval.</p>



<p>Fink&#8217;s stance on cryptocurrencies has evolved over time. In 2017, he expressed criticism, linking the popularity of digital currencies to money laundering. However, due to increasing client interest and the high costs associated with transactions, BlackRock decided to explore the cryptocurrency space.
