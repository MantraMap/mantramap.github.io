Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency in the market, is continuing its unstoppable uptrend. After consolidating for a short period between $29,900 and $30,300, BTC has marked a new annual high and breached the $31,000 mark, which it had not surpassed since June 2022.  As of this writing, the leading cryptocurrency in the market is trading at $31,300, representing a surge of over 4% in the last 24 hours.

The consolidation period that preceded this new high indicates that investors were likely accumulating BTC in anticipation of a breakout.  Could Bitcoin Reach $35,000 Soon? There&#8217;s good news for Bitcoin bulls, as the cryptocurrency has broken its nearest resistance level at $31,000 and aims to reach $31,500. If Bitcoin can break this last bear threshold, the road to $35,000 may be served on a silver platter for the bulls.  Additionally, the recent news of Blackrock&#8217;s Bitcoin spot ETF and major Wall Street giants expressing interest in investing in Bitcoin may further fuel investor sentiment and propel Bitcoin&#8217;s bull run. However, Bitcoin must hold its current price level to prevent this price action from being just a short squeeze followed by a further pullback. If the current price level is sustained, it could provide a solid foundation for continued growth and upward momentum. As the chart above indicates, Bitcoin’s ADX (Average Directional Index) is currently peaking upwards, signifying the current trend&#8217;s strength. The ADX is a technical indicator commonly used to quantify the strength of a trend in the financial markets. The ADX calculation is based on a moving average of the price range expansion over a given period. It measures the degree to which a market is trending, and it provides traders with a way to identify the strength of a trend and determine whether it is worth trading. When the ADX rises, the trend gains strength, while a falling ADX indicates that the trend is losing momentum. A high ADX reading suggests a strong trend is in place, while a low ADX reading suggests that the market is in a range-bound or choppy state.

However, the influx of new investors entering the BTC market may increase its volatility, posing the risk of liquidating late long positions that could impede Bitcoin&#8217;s bullish movement. Overall, Bitcoin&#8217;s recent performance is a trend to watch in the coming weeks and months, as it will likely have a significant impact on the broader cryptocurrency market and may attract increased attention from investors, regulators, and the public.
