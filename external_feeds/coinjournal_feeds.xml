<li>Bittrex was charged in April by the SEC for selling unregistered securities.</li>
<li>Besides Bittrex, Coinbase and Binance are also facing similar charges.</li>
<li>Although Bittrex agreed to pay the $24 million, it has not mentioned anything to do with accepting or denying the SEC allegations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The US-based cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/bittrex/">Bittrex&nbsp;</a>has agreed to settle $24 million with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the lawsuit where the SEC accused the exchange of offering unregistered securities to US investors. The SEC has today confirmed the payment in a tweet.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today we announced that crypto asset trading platform Bittrex Inc. and its co-founder and former CEO, William Shihara, agreed to settle charges that they operated an unregistered national securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency.</p>
<p>&mdash; U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (@SECGov) <a href="https://twitter.com/SECGov/status/1689741781481504768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 10, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The exchange, however, has not agreed to nor rejected the SEC allegations of offering unregistered securities.</p>
<h2>SEC&rsquo;s allegations against Bittrex</h2>
<p>The US SEC had filed a <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/sec-sues-crypto-exchange-bittrex-and-its-ex-ceo/">lawsuit against Bittrex and its former CEO</a>, William Shihara, in April for selling unregistered securities. The SEC also claimed that the exchange&rsquo;s foreign subsidiary, Bittrex Global GmbH, has failed to register as a national securities exchange.</p>
<p>Bittrex is not the only cryptocurrency under siege by the SEC. Binance and Coinbase are also facing similar charges. However, both <a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/binance/">Binance</a> and <a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/coinbase/">Coinbase</a> have vowed to fight till the end. Coinbase, which is a listed public company says that the SEC is contradicted since it knew about the exchanges dealing when the company applied to be listed as a public company.</p>
<p>However, the court is yet to approve the settlement and a Bitterx spokesperson said that they would comment more about the settlement once the court approves the agreement</p>

<li dir="ltr">Rocket Pool price soared nearly 10% after Coinbase Ventures&rsquo;s purchase of RPL tokens.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The Coinbase venture arm announced the strategic investment on Thursday.</li>
<li dir="ltr">RPL rose to highs of $29.25, with over $15 million traded in 24 hours as volume spiked 75%</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Rocket Pool (RPL) price soared nearly 10% on Thursday to trade at intraday highs of $29.25 on the crypto exchange <a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/coinbase/">Coinbase</a>. The token&rsquo;s 24-hour trading volume rose 75% to over $15 million.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The price of the decentralised <a href="https://coinjournal.net/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> staking protocol was around $28.45 at the time of writing, still up roughly 7% after a slight drawdown following broader crypto reaction to the US inflation data release.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Why did Rocket Pool price go up today?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Rocket Pool is a liquid staking protocol on Ethereum that has increasingly become popular across the ecosystem. Its <a href="https://rocketpool.net/#stake-run-node" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a> shows the protocol has over 779,800 ETH staked and more than 3,110 node operators. According to data from DeFiLlama, only Lido and Coinbase have more TVL than Rocket Pool among liquid staking platforms.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The native RPL tokens are used for incentivizing ecosystem users and for governance purposes. The RPL price surge today came after a major announcement related to the token.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On Thursday, Coinbase Ventures &ndash; the investment arm of US-based crypto exchange Coinbase, announced it had made a strategic investment in Rocket Pool. This was done via a purchase of RPL from the Rocket Pool team, Coinbase Ventures wrote on X (formerly Twitter).</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Exciting news to share: Coinbase Ventures recently made a strategic investment into <a href="https://twitter.com/Rocket_Pool?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Rocket_Pool</a> by purchasing RPL tokens from the Rocket Pool team.</p>
<p>&mdash; Coinbase Ventures &#128737;&#65039; (@cbventures) <a href="https://twitter.com/cbventures/status/1689639108837249024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 10, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p dir="ltr">The investment follows the Coinbase unit&rsquo;s move to join Rocket Pool&rsquo;s Oracle DAO and the unveiling of Base, the crypto exchange&rsquo;s layer-2 platform. Highlighting the collaboration with Rocket Pool, the Coinbase team said the investment is part of the push to scale Ethereum&rsquo;s infrastructure and bring the next billion users to the ecosystem.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>We know the Rocket Pool team shares this belief and we&rsquo;re delighted to support them via active participation in their Oracle DAO and using ETH from our corporate balance sheet to operate several hundred nodes on the Rocket Pool network</em>,&rdquo; they wrote on X.</p>

</ul>
<p><a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/gemini/">Gemini</a>, a cryptocurrency exchange, has announced that it will support the XRP Ledger (XRP) blockchain, adding it to a growing list of supported networks. The exchange has opened token deposits with trading expected to start soon be possible.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">

<p>XRP is now available for deposits on Gemini. Trading support will follow xtra soon. &#129309; <a href="https://t.co/f2EjxewRm0">pic.twitter.com/f2EjxewRm0</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Gemini (@Gemini) <a href="https://twitter.com/Gemini/status/1689634981738401793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 10, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The news has however done little to stop the bearish trend that has seen the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/ripple/">XRP token price</a> drop by over 6% in the past seven days.</p>
<h2>Why Gemini listing is a great plus for XRP</h2>
<p>The XRP token was delisted by all cryptocurrency exchanges when the United States Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs for what it stated as selling a security without the required registration. However, exchanges have been lining up to relist XRP after <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/ripple-wins-sec-case-xrp-not-a-security/">Ripple won the case</a>.</p>
<p>Gemini is known for having strict listing requirements, and many cryptocurrencies have struggled to meet them. Therefore, this news is encouraging for the XRP community after the recently won battle against the US SEC although there are speculations that the case could be appealed.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://coinjournal.net/ripple/what-is-ripple/">Ripple (XRP) </a>now available on Gemini Exchange, it is poised to reach a wider audience of investors and traders leading to increased liquidity and trading volume for the cryptocurrency. Besides its widespread acceptance across the crypto space, Ripple has also been working extremely hard to gain acceptance in the traditional financial world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Binance Labs is offering support to Curve after the recent hack.</li>
<li>The investment is part of recent OTC deals done by Curve founder with notable figures in the crypto space.</li>
<li>Curve Finance is later expected to deploy to the Binance-backed BNB Chain.</li>
</ul>
<p>The venture capital and incubator division of the cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/binance/">Binance</a>, Binance Labs, has agreed to invest $5 million in <a href="https://coinjournal.net/curve-dao/">Curve DAO (CRV)</a> tokens.</p>
<p>The collaboration, which will also see Curve Finance deploy to the Binance-backed BNB Chain, was announced by Yi He, co-founder of Binance and head of Binance Labs.</p>
<p>The investment seems to be a part of recent over-the-counter (OTC) transactions that Curve founder Michael Egorov conducted with prominent individuals in the cryptocurrency industry. Among them, Justin Sun, the founder of Tron, purchased 5 million CRV tokens for $2 million, while <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/huobi-co-founder-buys-10-million-curve-dao-tokens-from-curve-founder/">Huobi co-founder Jun Du purchased 10 million</a>.</p>
<h2>Binance support to Curve DAO after the hack</h2>
<p>Yi He has stated that Binance Labs pledges its full support to Curve through investment and a strategic partnership in light of the recent developments that have had an impact on the protocol. The Binance co-founder went ahead to state that they see this collaboration as a beginning and are eager to continue working together to advance the development of the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/defi/">DeFi ecosystem</a>.</p>
<p>According to on-chain data gathered by Spotonchain on Dune Analytics, Michael Egorov has sold more than 156 million CRV tokens so far for a total of $46.4 million. According to DeBank, the transactions appear to be strategically intended to lessen the potential liquidation risks that Egorov may face across numerous decentralised finance platforms as a result of a $50 million stablecoin loan he had taken earlier.</p>

<p dir="ltr">SEI is an upcoming layer-1 network in Binance launchpool.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Data by Aevo shows that investors are pricing in a market cap of $500 million.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">SEI token will be in the spotlight next week as <a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/binance/">Binance</a> is scheduled to <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/introducing-sei-sei-on-binance-launchpool-farm-sei-by-staking-bnb-tusd-and-fdusd-b1d3b4df9cb34f679783a4fdb891f643"><u>list</u></a> it on its platform. Data published by&nbsp;<a href="https://app.aevo.xyz/perpetual/sei"><u>Aevo</u></a>, a new crypto futures platform shows that the token will likely open at 26 cents. If this happens, it means that the token&rsquo;s market cap will be over $500 million, making it one of the most successful launches this year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">SEI is the 36th project coming from Binance launchpool. The other blockchains to come from the ecosystem are Sui and Bella Protocol. According to its website, Sei is a layer 1 network that specifically focuses n trading. It will enable developers to build projects that are at the intersection of centralized and decentralized exchanges.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sei uses the Twin-Turbo consensus and multiple degrees of parallelization to reduce latency and boost throughput. Its website identifies several projects in its ecosystem, including Alpha Venture DAO, Apollo DAO, and Astroport.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The challenge for SEI and other new layer-1 and layer-2 networks &ndash; including Coinbase&rsquo;s Base, is that the industry is highly saturated, with most activity happening in Ethereum. For example, PayPal selected <a href="https://coinjournal.net/ethereum">Ethereum</a> as its blockchain for the new <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/paypal-launches-a-us-dollar-stablecoin-on-the-ethereum-blockchain/">PYUSD stablecoin</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Many developers are also moving to layer-2 networks like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon. Most importantly, many of the recently launched layer 1 networks like Aptos and Sui have not gained traction among developers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Therefore, there is a likelihood that SEI token price will likely rise shortly after listing and then retreat shortly after that.</p>

</ul>
<p dir="ltr">San Francisco-based SoFi Bank, which has over 6.2 million customers, has revealed it holds up to $170 million worth of crypto, Trustnodes <a href="https://www.trustnodes.com/2023/08/09/a-us-bank-holds-170-million-in-crypto" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">SoFi Bank holds BTC, ETH, DOGE</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Per details in the bank&rsquo;s Q2 earnings report, the holdings include $82 million in <a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> (BTC), over $55 million in Ethereum (ETH), $5 million of Dogecoin (DOGE) and $4.5 million of Cardano (ADA).&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The filing also showed the bank held $3.5 million worth of Litecoin (LTC), $2.1 million of Solana (SOL) and $2.9 million in Ethereum Classic (ETC) at the end of the quarter.</p>
<p dir="ltr">SoFi Bank did not begin its operations as a bank, but rather transitioned into one after making a strategic acquisition in the US. The company launched its crypto offering in September 2019, but became a bank after its double acquisition of Golden Pacific Bancorp and Golden Pacific Bank in February 2022.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bank&rsquo;s growth has seen it add Federal Reserve stocks to its offering. Its crypto products are offered via a partnership with leading US-based crypto exchange Coinbase.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Customers can start trading BTC and other cryptocurrencies with as little as $10. However, its crypto platform is not a crypto wallet and does not support staking.</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">PayPal launched its stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar earlier this week.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Shiba Memu&rsquo;s presale has now raised more than $1.7 million.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">PayPal, one of the leading payment service providers in the world, announced earlier this week that it had launched its stablecoin.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With PayPal entering the stablecoin market, it could attract more institutional investors to enter the crypto market.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Memu&rsquo;s presale continues to move as expected, with the team raising more than $1.7 million so far.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">PayPal enters the stablecoin market</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Payments giant PayPal announced earlier this week that it had&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/paypal-launches-a-us-dollar-stablecoin-on-the-ethereum-blockchain/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>launched its stablecoin called PYUSD</u></a>. The stablecoin is pegged to the US Dollar, and PayPal users can use the stablecoin to make purchases online and convert to and from other cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">With PayPal&rsquo;s entry into the stablecoin, more than 400 million users could soon have access to PYUSD and, by extension, cryptocurrencies. The move could spark a major adoption of cryptocurrencies over the coming months and years.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What is Shiba Memu?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Increased adoption of cryptocurrencies could benefit projects such as Shiba Memu, which has shown to be a promising Web3 project.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Shiba Memu</u></a> is still in its presale stage, but the team has already garnered interest among investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">As a project, Shiba Memu seeks to combine the powers of AI and blockchain technology to create an unstoppable, entirely self-sufficient marketing powerhouse.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to their whitepaper, Shiba Memu is designed to handle the work of numerous marketing agencies. As an AI-based platform, Shiba Memu will operate 24/7, eliminating the restrictions imposed by traditional marketing agencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Memu&rsquo;s platform will always be active, creating advertisements superior to what traditional marketing platforms can generate.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Memu is launching as a meme coin thanks to the recent popularity of meme coins. The meme coin industry grew into a multi-billion dollar industry within a few years. The market cap of meme coins grew from practically $0 in 2020 to reach the $20 billion mark in 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Memu differs from the other thousands of meme tokens in the market because it offers real-world utility.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">It has self-sufficient marketing capabilities powered by AI technology. This feature makes it a project investors could be interested in. As a marketing platform, Shiba Memu will develop its own marketing strategies, write its own PR, and promote itself in relevant forums and social networks.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At the moment, Shiba Memu operates on the Ethereum and BNBChain blockchains.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Shiba Memu&rsquo;s presale tops $1.7M</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Memu&rsquo;s presale continues to generate waves, with the team raising more than $1.7 million so far.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The surge in investment can be attributed to more investors entering the project and the team&rsquo;s recent announcement that SHMU, the native token of Shiba Memu, will be&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/1-6m-raised-one-month-into-shiba-memu-presale-bitmart-listing-announced/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>listed on BitMart</u></a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">BitMart is one of the leading decentralised exchanges in the world and listing SHMU on the platform could make the token available to thousands of investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The funds generated from the presale will be challenged towards the development of Shiba Memu products.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Click here</u></a> to find out more about Shiba Memu&rsquo;s presale event.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">When is the best time to buy Shiba Memu?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Investing in a project depends on the decision of the investor. However, the best time to invest in a project is in its presale.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tokens are usually sold at a discount during the presale stage, and their prices tend to surge higher once they get listed on cryptocurrency exchanges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the cryptocurrency market also performing well since the start of the year, this might be a good time to invest in&nbsp;<a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Shiba Memu</u></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<li dir="ltr">Crypto market cap was at $1.22 trillion, just 0.7% in the past 24 hours.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Bitcoin and Ethereum remained near key areas, while XRP was holding above $0.62.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The SEC files letter in court seeking an interlocutory appeal on XRP programatic sales.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The total cryptocurrency market capitalization has declined by about 0.7% in the past 24 hours to around $1.22 trillion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While some altcoins in the top 20 by market cap category have posted 1-2% in losses within the 24-hour timeframe, many are trading flat even as the sector digests the latest <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/">crypto news</a> related to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its case against <a href="https://coinjournal.net/ripple/">Ripple</a>.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">XRP price shows resilience amid SEC&rsquo;s court appeal</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) continue to hover near key support levels on Thursday, trading just above $29.5k and $1,850 respectively. XRP is also showing resilience with prices hovering above $0.62, and about 2% down in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The outlook suggests the crypto market is largely unfazed by SEC&rsquo;s filing of a notice seeking an interlocutory appeal against last month&rsquo;s ruling that XRP was not a security. The partial victory saw crypto explode higher, with XRP leading the charge with over 100% in gains.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Several altcoins, including Solana, Cardano, NEAR and Polygon, which the SEC identified as securities in its lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase, rallied to new year-to-date highs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The news of SEC&rsquo;s push for an appeal hasn&rsquo;t rattled markets as such, and market observers say sentiment could be that the summary ruling already did the damage to the SEC. That the regulator is seeking &ldquo;a stay of all proceedings pending its appeal is not unexpected,&rdquo; said ex federal prosecutor James K. Filan.</p>

<li dir="ltr">Binance Labs has invested in AltLayer, a decentralised Rollups-as-a-Service (RaaS) protocol.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The collaboration is aimed at increasing overall access to app-tailored rollups across the Web3 ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Binance Labs, the venture capital arm and accelerator of leading crypto exchange <a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/binance/">Binance</a>, has made a strategic investment in layer-2 scalability blockchain AltLayer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The investment will help the protocol enhance the adoption of its decentralised Rollups-as&ndash;a-Service (RaaS) offering, growing its usability across Web3 applications, according to details shared in a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/binance-labs-makes-strategic-investment-in-altlayer-301896625.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> on Wednesday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">AltLayer&rsquo;s Beacon Layer provides access to sequencing, execution, and verification for rollups, with all types of users including developers able to create and customise a rollup within two minutes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Nicola W., the investment director at Binance Labs, commented:</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>Application-tailored rollups offer the security of Layer 1s and the customizability of appchains. However, a common issue with rollups today is that they mostly operate with centralised sequencers and create fragmented liquidity and userbase. We found AltLayer&rsquo;s approach to facilitating the launch of application-tailored rollups via Beacon Layer an inspired take. Their core network offers several decentralisation and interoperability properties much needed in a world of thousands of rollups. All this while dramatically cutting down time-to-market and encouraging rapid innovation and experimentation</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">AltLayer partnerships</h2>
<p dir="ltr">AltLayer&rsquo;s application-tailored rollups have seen increased adoption across the ecosystem, with this boosted by its multi-chain and multi-VM support. &nbsp;Industry players collaborating with AltLayer include EigenLayer, Espresso, Double Jump, Arbitrum, Linea, Celestia and Jump. &nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The protocol&rsquo;s latest collaboration comes after Tuesday&rsquo;s announcement of a partnership with Hyperlane as they look to expand &lsquo;permissionless interoperability&rsquo; to rollups.</p>
