That is exactly how he sees the social network. He said, "That is something incredibly significant."</p><p>Second, Binance likes supporting "excellent entrepreneurs." The CEO of Binance believes that Elon Musk, the founder of firms like Tesla and SpaceX, is a fantastic businessman.</p><p>Third, the potential for Twitter to develop into a "super app". Musk himself had previously made a comment about this. Zhao likens WeChat, a Chinese platform that combines a social network, a commerce site, and a way to make payments, to Twitter.</p><p><i>“We want to help bring Twitter to Web3 and help solve problems like charging for subscriptions. Something that could be done very easily globally using cryptocurrencies as a means of payment.”</i> Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance added.</p><p>CZ rushed in as soon as Musk announced his desire to buy the social network, making little effort to keep their $500 million contribution to the buyout a secret.<br /></p><p><i style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; text-align: center;">---------------<br /><b>Author:&nbsp;</b>Oliver Redding<br /></i><i style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span><span style="color: #cc0000;">Seattle Newsdesk&nbsp;</span></span><span style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;">&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.globalcryptopress.com/" style="backface-visibility: hidden; box-sizing: border-box; cursor: pointer; display: inline; margin: 0px; text-decoration-line: none; touch-action: manipulation;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;">Breaking Crypto News</span></a></span></span></span></i></p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/GlobalCryptoPress" title="Subscribe to our feed" rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml"><img src="//feedburner.google.com/fb/images/pub/feed-icon32x32.png" alt="" style="border:0"/></a><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/GlobalCryptoPress" title="Subscribe to our feed" rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml">Subscribe to GCP in a reader</a></div>
