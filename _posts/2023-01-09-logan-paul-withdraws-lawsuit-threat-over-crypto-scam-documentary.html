<p>YouTuber Logan Paul has promised to drop his threats of filing a defamation lawsuit over a three-part documentary that painted Paul&rsquo;s CryptoZoo project as a &ldquo;scam.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
No Lawsuit On Coffeezilla
<p>Controversial Youtube influencer Logan Paul is once again in the news over his crypto project, CryptoZoo. This time, he has taken back his threats to sue internet detective Stephen &ldquo;Coffeezilla&rdquo; Findeisen. Coffeezilla had produced and released a three-part documentary that highlighted Paul&rsquo;s CryptoZoo project and labeled it a scam. In response, Paul released a video in which he threatened to sue Coffeezilla. However, Paul has deleted that tweet since then, and according to Coffeezilla, also promised not to file the defamation lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coffeezilla tweeted,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Logan called me. He said he&rsquo;s deleting the two responses, and is dropping the lawsuit threats. I believe he&rsquo;s making a 3rd response, which I&rsquo;ll be delaying my video to include. Hopefully this time he takes accountability and refunds the victims of CryptoZoo. That&rsquo;s what matters.&rdquo;</p>

Logan Paul Apologizes
<p>The drama started after Coffeezilla dropped the first video of his three-part video series on December 17. In this video, he called out Logan Paul for being the face of an unscrupulous project, which, according to him, had engaged in business malpractices. Paul responded by accusing him of defamation and threatened him with a lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, according to Coffeezilla&rsquo;s recent tweets, the two Youtubers have hashed out their differences. In fact, Coffeezilla even shared a screenshot of a message from Paul&rsquo;s Discord server, where he apologized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The excerpt from the screenshot reads,</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was rash and misaligned with the trust issue at hand, so I called him today and apologized. The war is not with Coffee. In fact, I&rsquo;m grateful he brought this to light. I will be taking accountability, apologizing, and coming forward with a plan in the near future,&rdquo;</p>

Problems With CryptoZoo
<p>Paul had touted the CryptoZoo project as a fun blockchain game that allows players to earn money as they play. The game, which is still in an unfinished stage introduces a new cryptocoin. Furthermore, players will also be buying and selling eggs that will hatch into animal-based NFTs, in order to breed and create new eggs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Findeisen had conducted a months-long investigation on the same, exposing significant issues in the P2E game. The video reports accused Paul and the development team of shady practices. Controversy has dogged the project from the start. One of the game&rsquo;s developers, Zech Kelling lied about the number of people working on the game. Reports claimed that Kelling has fled to Switzerland with the game&rsquo;s code.&nbsp;</p>
