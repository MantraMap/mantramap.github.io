			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s5">As the crypto market gains momentum, it continues to attract the attention of both seasoned investors and newcomers. Among the many projects in the crypto space, the Uwerx presale has emerged as a focal point for traders looking to capitalize on a promising digital asset. </p>
<p class="s5">The Sandbox (SAND) and EOS (EOS) have also caught the attention of investors with their potential for substantial price movements. Understanding the dynamics of these projects can provide valuable insights for traders seeking profitable opportunities. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know.</p>
The Sandbox (SAND): Expanding Its User Base
<p class="s5">The decentralized gaming virtual world, the Sandbox (SAND), is expanding its presence in Asia by creating a local ecosystem with over 40 partners. They aim to empower users by providing updated tools for generating content and collaborating with educational institutions, including renowned institutes like HKDI and HKUST. </p>
<p class="s5">By Q3 2023, virtual LAND owners and creators can expect improved content management tools, allowing for a wider range of experiences. The Sandbox (SAND) is also establishing an ecosystem for its open metaverse platform through partnerships with metaverse agencies and the launch of new experiences. </p>
<p class="s5">The project's achievements were recognized during The Sandbox Partner Day, and they highlighted the support received from prominent Hong Kong organizations. With plans for additional LAND sales and partnerships in the Greater China region, The Sandbox (SAND) emphasizes the long-term value they aim to create for their users.</p>
Get Ready For Enhanced DeFi Experience With EOS (EOS)
<p class="s5">The EOS (EOS) ecosystem has been experiencing notable advancements, attracting attention from enthusiasts, investors, and stakeholders. One significant development is a recent webinar that shed light on the EOS EVM and its advantages for Ethereum (ETH) developers. </p>
<p class="s5">The EOS EVM webinar provided insights into the adoption expectations, target audience, development process, funding, and maintenance of EOS EVM. The use of the EOS token to pay for lower gas fees was also a key topic of discussion, engaging the community and exploring its implications.</p>
<p class="s5">Furthermore, the integration of tracking support for the DeFi sector on EOS EVM by CoinMarketCap is seen as a positive sign. As a result, Neutroswap, the leading DEX on EOS EVM, is already transacting a substantial volume and has a significant amount of value locked. In addition, initiatives like Yield+ and Pomelo Grants are also gaining momentum, incentivizing dApp developers and fostering collaboration between IBC partners. </p>
<p class="s5">These developments indicate a growing and vibrant EOS (EOS) ecosystem with ample room for improvement and opportunities. </p>
Uwerx (WERX): Delivering Massive Return Opportunities In The Crypto Market
<p class="s5">Uwerx has emerged as a top investment choice, attracting investors due to its unique features and potential. As the first decentralized freelance platform, Uwerx disrupts the freelance industry by introducing smart contracts, transparency, and cost reduction. This real-world application of blockchain technology appeals to investors seeking disruptive projects. </p>
<p class="s5">The recent price increase and projected substantial returns further ignite investor enthusiasm, with experts predicting Uwerx to reach $2.6 by Q4 2024.</p>
<p class="s5">Uwerx's commitment to security, credibility, and decentralization enhances its appeal. It has obtained successful audit approvals from SolidProof and InterFi Network, locked developers&rsquo; liquidity tokens, and plans to renounce ownership of smart contracts once the project is ready to be listed on centralized exchanges. </p>
<p class="s5">The recently unveiled alpha version showcases essential features like the Landing page and Sign-in/Sign-up pages, while continuous platform enhancements are planned for the beta version.</p>
<p class="s5">Furthermore, Uwerx offers the Uwerx Vault, allowing users to stake tokens and earn rewards, demonstrating its dedication to creating additional earning opportunities for the community.</p>
<p class="s5">Overall, Uwerx presents a promising investment opportunity with significant potential returns in the dynamic crypto market. Join the Uwerx revolution today to enjoy a 15% bonus on all purchases and unlock referral bonuses after the next price increase.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s3">Bitcoin (BTC) and its hard forks are captivating the market, with Bitcoin SV (BSV) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) soaring. However, amidst this frenzy, InQubeta, an AI altcoin, has piqued the curiosity of investors and is being selected as the go-to investment.</p>
<p class="s3">In this article, we will explain what makes InQubeta stand out in the crypto landscape. Join us as we delve into Bitcoin hard forks and explore why smart investors are doubling down on the AI token InQubeta.</p>
InQubeta (QUBE): The token not to miss out on
<p class="s3">Defying all expectations, smart investors are doubling down on InQubeta, despite the surge in the price of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin SV (BSV). The commitment to investment in its utility token, QUBE, is largely responsible for it being an AI altcoin and for its revolutionary idea of solving a critical problem in the industry.</p>
<p class="s3">InQubeta is the world's first crowdfunding platform built for AI businesses to raise capital as well as for investors to acquire interests in promising projects. Its marketplace will allow investors to invest in AI startups by purchasing fractionalized investment opportunities.</p>
<p class="s3">Its fractional investment model reinforced investors' commitment towards investment as its innovative idea allows ownership of fractions of AI startups and eliminates investment limits. In addition, the gains that come from being an investor and holder further bolster confidence in the project. For instance, as one of the fastest-growing industries, investors stand to gain ridiculously high profits by investing early in promising AI projects. Additionally, the coin is expected to benefit from the increasing adoption of AI, which means it will soar in the coming months, making it a more compelling investment.</p>
<p class="s3">To participate in the presale, you can click on the link below. It is currently in stage 1, and a token costs $0.00875.</p>
<p></p>
Bitcoin Cash (BCH) experiences a significant surge during Bitcoin&rsquo;s rally
<p class="s3">Bitcoin Cash (BCH) came about from a hard fork in the blockchain, aimed at increasing the block size limit to make it more scalable by enabling cheaper and faster transactions. Bitcoin Cash&rsquo;s (BCH) price movement has been largely unimpressive this year, as it hovered for the most part below $146. </p>
<p class="s3">However, a price upturn on June 21 saw Bitcoin Cash trade above $200, although it has been experiencing a slight decline in price. Its rally came during Bitcoin&rsquo;s (BTC) rally, showing its dependency. However, despite Bitcoin Cash&rsquo;s uptrends, investors are still keen on investing in or diversifying parts of their investments in InQubeta because of its immense growth potential.</p>
Bitcoin SV (BSV) trades in tandem with Bitcoin (BTC) as it rallies alongside
<p class="s3">Bitcoin SV (BSV) emerged after a hard fork of Bitcoin Cash blockchain, making it one of Bitcoin&rsquo;s hard forks even if not directly. Bitcoin SV, which stands for &ldquo;Bitcoin Satoshi Vision,&rdquo; sought to restore what is considered the original vision of Bitcoin as outlined by its creator.</p>
<p class="s3">As Bitcoin&rsquo;s hard fork, Bitcoin SV often mirrors its price movement, which is currently on a rally. After Bitcoin SV&rsquo;s bearish descent from mid-May to the middle of June, Bitcoin SV regained bullish momentum and has been on a price swing. Despite its upswing, investors are still doubling down on InQubeta.</p>
Conclusion
<p class="s3">Despite the surge of Bitcoin&rsquo;s hard forks like Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin Cash, InQubeta has emerged as a shining star and captured the attention of investors. Its trailblazing idea that combines AI with the limitless potential of blockchain technology, as well as exponential returns on investment, has led investors to double down. As a worthwhile investment, it has been experiencing huge presale participation, which will increase further in the coming week. To participate in the presale, click on the link below.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>According to a recent report by the FATF, more than half of all UN member countries have still not implemented the Travel Rule.</p>
<p>As of June 2023, as reported by the FATF, more than half of the UN member countries have failed to enforce the Travel Rule. According to the Financial Action Task Force, the rule is necessary in order to close a loophole in crypto assets that might be exploited by money launderers and those funding terrorism.</p>
<p>According to an article in the Business Times Online, the Travel Rule is recommendation #16 of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) which lays down that all crypto companies must &ldquo;screen, record and communicate the information of all users of their platform&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This would have the effect of destroying any anonymity for crypto users, with the exception of those who are transacting in amounts less than $1,000.</p>
What is the FATF?
<p>The FATF is a 39-member body that gives financial recommendations to all UN nations. Given that it is an unelected body, financial decisions in each country are the responsibility of that country and the recommendations can be implemented or not by each country.</p>
<p>However, should any country choose not to implement all of the recommendations then it comes under &ldquo;increased monitoring&rdquo; of its financial activities.</p>
AML and terrorist financing
<p>According to the FATF, at the heart of all the recommendations are a desire to root out any money laundering or terrorist financing that might be taking place in a country&rsquo;s financial system. This purportedly gives it the right and full authority to investigate how money is dealt with everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>The FATF is of the opinion that crypto assets can be used for the aforementioned illegal activities and therefore wants all countries to enforce the Travel Rule in order to negate any of these activities.</p>
Many jurisdictions ignore recommendations
<p>The fact that nearly three quarters of jurisdictions across the world have complied only partially or not at all with the FATF recommendations perhaps says much for a feeling that this non-elected agency is maybe interfering too much in the financial affairs of sovereign countries.</p>
<p>Also, given that the FATF is closely associated with the IMF and the World Bank, it might be seen as having a more &lsquo;Western&rsquo; bias that may not be as acceptable to certain jurisdictions across the world.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>South Africa&rsquo;s financial regulator has ordered crypto exchanges in the country to apply for licenses before the end of the year to continue operating. </p>
<p>Bloomberg reports South Africa&rsquo;s Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) said cryptocurrency exchanges operating within the country must apply for licenses before year end to continue their operations.</p>
<p>FSCA Commissioner Unathi Kamlana said in an interview that the authority received about 20 applications since opening licenses a few weeks ago and expects more to be submitted before the deadline on November 20.</p>
<p>Kamlana said the FSCA plans to take &ldquo;enforcement action&rdquo; against exchanges that continue to operate without a license after the deadline, adding that firms could be closed down or fined. The Commissioner said:</p>

<p>There is potentially serious harm to financial customers when using crypto products, and therefore it makes sense for us to introduce the regulatory framework.</p>
<p>Time will tell the effectiveness of our measures, and we will continue to work together with the industry to refine and make changes where and if necessary.</p>

<p>Exchanges which operate in South Africa include Binance, the Digital Currency Group-owned Luno, and the Pantera Capital-backed VALR. All these exchanges need to secure licenses if they wish to continue their operations.</p>
Regulators Step Up Crypto Oversight
<p>South Africa&rsquo;s tightened crypto oversight comes after a string of bankruptcies in 2022 caused the market to spiral. The collapse of FTX was the catalyst which heightened scrutiny of crypto firms and exchanges.</p>
<p>EU regulators formally signed its landmark Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) into law on May 31, with measures set to take force in 2024. European legislators also formally enacted another law on anti-money laundering, which mandates crypto providers to authenticate their customers&rsquo; identities when conducting wire transfers.</p>
<p>The UK also voted to pass into law its Financial Services and Markets bill, which will see the country on its way to dealing with crypto as a &ldquo;regulated activity.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Tests 30862 Target:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 5 July 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) retraced part of its recent pullback early in the Asian session as the pair moved back above the 31000 figure after trading as low as the 30870.63 area, representing a test of a downside price objective related to recent selling pressure around the 31333 and 31097 areas.&nbsp; The recent sell-off to the 29417.14 area represented a test of the 38.2% retracement of the appreciating range from 26165.98 to 31443.67.&nbsp; This depreciation occurred after BTC/USD rallied higher to the 30277 area, its strongest print in several trading sessions, and increased the possibility of a test of the 28604.83 area.&nbsp; The pair&rsquo;s recent print around the 31443.67 area was a twelve-month high and test of an upside price objective associated with buying pressure that strengthened around the 26637.41 area.&nbsp; Additional upside price objectives include the 31737, 32125, and 33569 areas.&nbsp; Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 31674, 32043, 34531, and 34658 areas.</p>
<p>Following recent selling pressure, areas of potential technical support and buying pressure include the 29863, 29427, 28886, 28804, 28182, 28096, and 27306 areas.&nbsp; &nbsp;Stops were also recently triggered above additional upside price objectives around the 29068, 29159, 29458, 30088, 30200, 30292, and 30477 levels.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Technicians are closely watching to see how much technical support develops around the 28095.44 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the historical depreciating range from 69000 to 15460.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 30556.97 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 30825.47.</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;24440.41/ 23270.10/ 22769.39 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In an attempt to combat fraud, Belarus is looking to put an end to peer-to-peer crypto exchanges.&nbsp;</p>
&ldquo;Crypto-Friendly&rdquo; Belarus Cracking Down?&nbsp;
<p>In an effort to combat fraud and tighten its grip on cryptocurrency transactions, the Belarusian government is contemplating a ban on peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto trading. The proposed crackdown aims to protect consumers and prevent illegal activities within the cryptocurrency market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>P2P crypto trading refers to the exchange of cryptocurrency between two individuals directly, without the involvement of a third party like a crypto exchange.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Belarus, known for its relatively lenient stance on cryptocurrency, embraced blockchain technology and even legalized cryptocurrency mining and exchange activities in 2017. It has been called one of the most crypto-friendly countries in the world, as it offers a tax exemption for individuals and businesses conducting crypto transactions. A year ago, President Lukashenko even signed a decree to ratify the free circulation of cryptocurrencies in the country.&nbsp;</p>
Trying To Curb Money Laundering
<p>The country&rsquo;s Ministry of Internal Affairs released a statement on Sunday revealing that malicious actors were using the P2P crypto services to transact dirty funds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The statement read,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since the beginning of the year, employees of the cybercrime counteraction units have stopped the activities of 27 citizens who provide illegal cryptocurrency exchange services. Their total illegal income amounted to almost 22 million rubles ($8.7 million).&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a result, the proposed ban seeks to restrict the direct exchange of cryptocurrencies between individuals without any intermediary platform. By eliminating P2P trading, Belarus hopes to curb fraudulent schemes and money laundering attempts that have been prevalent in the country's crypto space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The notice also explained that citizens would be able to conduct such financial transactions only through the registered exchanges in order to promote transparency and government control.&nbsp;</p>
How Will Ban Affect Belarus&rsquo;s Crypto Landscape?&nbsp;
<p>The decision comes amidst rising instances of fraud within the country's cryptocurrency sector. Scammers have taken advantage of the anonymous nature of P2P transactions to carry out various fraudulent schemes, defrauding unsuspecting individuals of their hard-earned money.</p>
<p>Although critics have argued that a blanket ban on P2P crypto trading may stifle innovation and hinder the growth of the industry, it is interesting to note that the country has recently renewed its crypto tax exemption law to be in effect till 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the proposed ban on P2P crypto trading in Belarus is still in the discussion stage. The government is expected to consult with industry experts and stakeholders to carefully weigh the potential consequences before finalizing any regulatory measures.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Vara Network, the Layer1 built using the Substrate framework, has released details of its latest testnet. A raft of new improvements have been specified that will make the forthcoming testnet smoother and equipped with subtle fixes that should simplify program creation and dapp deployment.</p>
<p>The majority, if not all, of the upgrades to Vara&rsquo;s stable testnet will be beyond the comprehension of the average user, but developers with experience of working in Rust will grasp the benefits they confer. Vara has listed the most important upgrades to its testnet, but the full list, including bug fixes, is extensive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Vara Steps Things Up a Notch
<p>The optimization of Vara&rsquo;s testnet is a crucial stage that will support a much larger goal: to launch a highly scalable Layer1 network that can host multitudes of dapps, with no trade-offs in terms of fees, security, or throughput. To achieve this, there&rsquo;s much work to be done on the testnet, where bugs are to be squashed, stability ensured, and new features added.</p>
<p>Most of the improvements being incorporated into the latest build of Vara&rsquo;s stable testnet concern smart contracts. The team developing Vara Network have been largely focused on incorporating features that make it easier to run programs and to debug them when issues are encountered. Chief among these is the introduction of automatic replies from programs.</p>
<p>As the Vara team explains in a blog post outlining the testnet changes, &ldquo;With this new update, your active program will always send a reply to an incoming message, even if its execution encounters a hiccup.&rdquo; Devs working on the Vara testnet are also now relieved of adding in boilerplate code over and over thanks to a new autogenerated metahash function.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Small Changes That Make a Big Difference
<p>Many of the upgrades to Vara&rsquo;s new testnet may seem slight, but combined they make for a significant improvement to the current iteration. There&rsquo;s a new reply deposit feature, enabling devs to provide a gas deposit from the current message to handle a future reply message. The async send functions also benefit from a new deposit argument, which Vara is billing &ldquo;a game-changing improvement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The status code retrieval in functions that handle replies or signals has also been improved and it&rsquo;s now much easier to restart paused programs thanks to new extrinsics for program reactivation. The msg::origin function has been removed from gstd for security purposes, as has the obsolete delay argument which is no longer contained within function signatures related to sending replies.</p>
<p>One of the biggest improvements to Vara&rsquo;s latest testnet is the enhancement to the metadata file format supported. It will now accommodate multiple languages aside from Rust. Finally, the Vara team has made numerous bug fixes that should improve the running of dapps and contracts deployed on its testnet. All told, these changes should bring the testnet to a state much closer to that resembling the mainnet, whose deployment looms closer.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the Winklevoss twins has demanded a payment of $1.47 billion from Digital Currency Group (DCG)&rsquo;s Barry Silbert.&nbsp;</p>
Winklevoss Calls Out Silbert
<p>In an interesting turn of events, Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini, has made a final offer demanding a payment of $1.47 billion from DCG&rsquo;s CEO Barry Silbert. He also threatened the latter with legal action if the final payment offer was not met by the deadline of July 6, 4 PM ET. Winklevoss claimed that the legal action would include a detailed report of Silbert&rsquo;s personal liability in hiding Genesis&rsquo;s insolvency issues and filing a Turnover Motion to force the immediate payment of the $630 million payment owed to creditors.&nbsp;</p>
DCG&rsquo;s Credit Struggles
<p>When Genesis&rsquo;s parent company DCG got caught up in the credit crisis of 2022, the latter entered into negotiations with creditors. However, the company did miss a $630 million payment to Genesis in May, which has now led to Cameron Winklevoss penning the open letter to Silbert, with the final offer of a $1.47 compensation. This substantial amount reflects the magnitude of the alleged damages and underlines the seriousness of the accusations against DCG and Silbert.</p>
&ldquo;Game Over&rdquo;: Winklevoss
<p>Winklevoss posted the open letter on Twitter on Monday, claiming that Silbert had never had any intentions of resolving the matter with the creditors in mind ever since the company had halted its withdrawals. He claimed that instead of working on a proper resolution to return their funds to the Earn users, Silbert and his team have dedicated the last eight months to buy time, to &ldquo;raise money and stiff creditors and Earn users again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wrote,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I write to inform you that your games are over. In addition to dragging out a resolution, they have ballooned professional fees to over $100 million, all of which have gone to lawyers and advisors at the expense of creditors and Earn users. Enough is enough.&rdquo;</p>

$1.2B Owed To Earn Customers
<p>The demand comes amidst allegations of fraud involving Barry Silbert, founder of DCG, and has sparked widespread speculation within the cryptocurrency community. Gemini had previously lent customer funds to Genesis under the Earn program. Winklevoss claimed that more than 232,000 Earn users have over $1.2 billion of assets trapped in Genesis. Other than this amount, DCG also owes a further $2.1 billion to creditors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Winklevoss closed out the letter by writing,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've seen a lot of bad behavior from you and your colleagues over the last 9 months, but perhaps the most disturbing part is something you said to me this Fall that you're a victim in all of this. It takes a special kind of person to owe $3.3 billion dollars to hundreds of thousands of people and believe, or at least pretend to believe, that they are some kind of victim.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Thailand has followed in Singapore&rsquo;s footsteps by banning crypto exchanges from offering lending and staking services to retail investors. </p>
<p>Thailand becomes the second Southeast Asian nation to ban crypto staking activities for retail investors.</p>
Thailand Bans Lending and Staking Services
<p>The Thai SEC announced it is banning crypto exchanges from offering lending and staking services. On Monday, the securities agency issued new rules for digital asset service providers aiming to improve investor protection.</p>
<p>According to the Thai SEC:</p>

<p>It is forbidden to advertise or persuade the general public or do any other act in the manner of supporting the deposit staking &amp; lending service.</p>

<p>The regulator explained the ban applies to &ldquo;depository services that offer returns to depositors and lenders,&rdquo; meaning exchanges are outright banned from offering such services. The SEC&rsquo;s new rules will take effect on July 31, 2023.</p>
<p>Under the new rules, the SEC also introduced a mandatory trading risk disclaimer which exchanges must make clearly visible to customers.</p>
<p>The risk disclaimer reads:</p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies are high risk. Please study and understand the risks of cryptocurrencies thoroughly, because you may lose your entire investment.</p>

<p>Further, the Thai SEC requires exchange operators to ensure users acknowledge trading risks before consenting to use such services. Finally, the SEC introduced investor suitability assessments to determine how much users may invest in crypto.</p>
Singapore Bans Lending and Staking for Retail Investors
<p>The Thai SEC&rsquo;s ban follows an announcement from Singapore&rsquo;s Monetary Authority (MAS) which also seeks to ban such services for retail investors. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The regulator said in a statement on Monday that it determined staking activities are unsuitable for the retail public given the &ldquo;extremely high risk and speculative nature&rdquo; of those activities.</p>
<p>The MAS said:</p>

<p>Regulations alone cannot protect consumers from all losses, given the extremely high risk and speculative nature of digital payment token trading.</p>

<p>In addition to the ban, the MAS will require crypto exchanges to safeguard customer assets in a trust before the end of the year.</p>

<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) today announced new requirements for Digital Payment Token (DPT) service providers to safekeep customer assets under a statutory trust before the end of the year. This will mitigate the risk of loss or misuse of customers&rsquo; assets, and facilitate the recovery of customers&rsquo; assets in the event of a DPT service provider&rsquo;s insolvency.</p>

<p>Thailand and Singapore&rsquo;s new investor protection rules come after the 2022 crypto lending crisis caused several firms to go bankrupt, costing investors billions of dollars.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The UK Financial Conduct Authority has taken the big four banks to task because they have set their savings rates too low, to the detriment of customers.</p>
A paltry return on savings
<p>When the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has to publicly shame the big UK banks because their pitiful easy-access savings rates for customers are between 0.7% to 1.35%, then you get an idea of how badly the banks are treating their clients.</p>
<p>At a time when the Bank of England has only recently raised the base rate again from 4.5% to 5% there is absolutely no excuse for the banks to continue to give their customers such a paltry return on their cash.</p>
<p>HSBC, Natwest, Barclays and Lloyds are the big 4 banks in question here, and according to Reuters, the top brass from these banks have been invited to the FCA on Thursday in order to discuss the issue.</p>
<p>Reuters quoted a person familiar with the FCA&rsquo;s position who said:</p>

<p>"We do think there is more value that can be provided to consumers, we are not happy with some of the lower savings rates we see, and we want banks to be supporting customers&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;. and people to be able to make informed choices,"</p>

<p>With UK inflation staying at 8.7% for the second month in a row, consumers are up against it. Food inflation is around 30% and with the average 5-year fixed mortgage rate above 6% the UK economy is starting to scream.</p>
<p>In this kind of environment, for the banks to be just looking out for themselves is grossly wrong. These are the banks that are judged as too big to fail, and will get bailed out/in if/when they get to the point of collapse.</p>
<p>The question has to be asked: Why would anyone with any extra money put it into a bank? The official inflation rate of 8.5% is well over 10% if you take into account how items included in inflation are manipulated over the years.</p>
<p>Therefore, to receive around 1% for savings that are losing around 10% a year does not make the slightest bit of sense. The only way the banks are able to get away with this is because people are just not informed as to how they can best deploy their savings.</p>
An alternative
<p>On that note, Bitcoin rose more than 100% since the beginning of the year. There is no guarantee that this will continue, and there is a lot of volatility in what is still a very tiny asset class.</p>
<p>However, the investor has to make a choice between a fiat currency that will go to zero with 100% certainty, and Bitcoin, which is the scarcest and most secure asset in the world. Anybody who might think to make this choice should educate themselves fully on the matter.</p>

<p>HSBC, Natwest, Barclays and Lloyds are the big 4 banks in question here, and according to Reuters, the top brass from these banks have been invited to the FCA on Thursday in order to discuss the issue.</p>
<p>Reuters quoted a person familiar with the FCA&rsquo;s position who said:</p>

<p>"We do think there is more value that can be provided to consumers, we are not happy with some of the lower savings rates we see, and we want banks to be supporting customers&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;. and people to be able to make informed choices,"</p>

<p>With UK inflation staying at 8.7% for the second month in a row, consumers are up against it. Food inflation is around 30% and with the average 5-year fixed mortgage rate above 6% the UK economy is starting to scream.</p>
<p>In this kind of environment, for the banks to be just looking out for themselves is grossly wrong. These are the banks that are judged as too big to fail, and will get bailed out/in if/when they get to the point of collapse.</p>
<p>The question has to be asked: Why would anyone with any extra money put it into a bank? The official inflation rate of 8.5% is well over 10% if you take into account how items included in inflation are manipulated over the years.</p>
<p>Therefore, to receive around 1% for savings that are losing around 10% a year does not make the slightest bit of sense. The only way the banks are able to get away with this is because people are just not informed as to how they can best deploy their savings.</p>
An alternative
<p>On that note, Bitcoin rose more than 100% since the beginning of the year. There is no guarantee that this will continue, and there is a lot of volatility in what is still a very tiny asset class.</p>
<p>However, the investor has to make a choice between a fiat currency that will go to zero with 100% certainty, and Bitcoin, which is the scarcest and most secure asset in the world. Anybody who might think to make this choice should educate themselves fully on the matter.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Open Network (TON) has announced the release of an on-chain encrypted messaging feature, allowing private messages between TON users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Previously, users could post on-chain messages. However, these were unencrypted and available to the public.&nbsp;</p>
Encrypted Transaction Messages&nbsp;
<p>The announcement was made on the 3rd of July by the TON Foundation. The TON blockchain network was forked from code that was created by the team behind the Telegram instant messaging app. However, the project was abandoned in 2020, but not before the team open-sourced TON&rsquo;s code. This allowed others to pick up from where the original team left off. The current network was created by the TON Foundation, a non-profit organization that seeks to promote TON among developers and users. According to the TON Foundation, the network gives users far greater scalability and transaction throughput than other options available in the Web3 ecosystem while also offering a high level of decentralization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TON has always allowed users to send personalized messages when conducting transactions or sending NFTs to each other. However, these messages were completely public. With the introduction of the new feature, users can encrypt the messages end-to-end, meaning only the intended recipient will be able to view the message. The feature is a welcome addition to TON&rsquo;s already highly secure platform. Furthermore, to increase the availability of the new service, the charge to send an encrypted message through the TON blockchain has been set at 0.006 Toncoin (TON) per transaction. Core developer at the TON Foundation, Anatoly Makosov, stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When sending Toncoin, Jettons, or NFTs on TON, you have always been able to include a text for the recipient such as &lsquo;for coffee&rsquo; or &lsquo;happy birthday,&rsquo; thereby personalizing the interaction. Now this popular feature [...] is available with full encryption.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He further added&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even in the event of an apocalypse and the failure of conventional messenger servers, you will retain the ability to send messages via the decentralized TON blockchain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In such a scenario, TON could serve as a reliable and secure method of communication.&nbsp;</p>
TON Working Towards Accelerating Ecosystem&nbsp;
<p>The TON Foundation has been at the heart of rebuilding the TON ecosystem and attracting Web 3.0 developers and builders. In April 2022, TON users collectively donated $1 billion to the foundation and its efforts to advance the TON ecosystem. The donations in question were made over a ten-day window starting on the 7th of April, 2022. In total, around 527 million TON, equalling just over $1 billion, were donated by users, primarily TON whales.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In May 2023, the TON Foundation enlisted the blockchain data platform Chainalysis with plans to utilize its Crypto Incident Response Service to provide round-the-clock support in the event of a hack or exploit. By partnering with Chainalysys, TON can access a robust and proven way to combat hacks or other unauthorized intrusions.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Geneva, Switzerland, July 4th, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>Today, the TRON ecosystem welcomes its first Real World Asset (RWA) product, stUSDT, which is operating through the decentralized platform JustLend. TRON founder and member of Huobi's global advisory board, Justin Sun, has voiced his belief that stUSDT will evolve into the crypto version of Alipay&rsquo;s Yu&rsquo;e Bao, a money market fund product offered by Alibaba. Sun is convinced that it will serve as a bridge connecting traditional markets to blockchain ecosystems while empowering crypto users with more options. From July 10 to August 10, 2023, the stUSDT platform is set to launch a welcome campaign offering an increased APY of up to 10% (normally expected to be around 5%) to enhance users&rsquo; first experience with RWAs on TRON. Users can also enjoy discounts on redemption fees of stUSDT from July 3 to August 10. Please refer to Medium for daily updates on the RWA fund allocation and rebases.</p><p>With a vast global user base and a $50 billion stablecoin market cap, stUSDT, a TRON-based RWA product, has sparked considerable industry excitement upon its introduction. It is primed to serve as a cornerstone for TRON's RWA endeavors and towards building a financial gateway that aims to empower 8 billion people worldwide.</p><p>TRON's RWA product unleashes new opportunities</p><p>Today, RWA is a popular concept in the crypto industry. The stUSDT platform is dedicated to narrowing the divide between retail and institutional investors while connecting the crypto realm with the real world. stUSDT ensures equal opportunities for all to invest in RWAs. This is the first endeavor in the TRON ecosystem to tokenize RWAs and introduce them to the community.</p><p>stUSDT, the TRON ecosystem's answer to stETH on the Lido protocol, is a decentralized token that serves as proof of investment in RWAs and its holders can earn passive incomes from real world assets. stUSDT introduces more decentralized and robust asset management mechanisms. The ultimate goal of stUSDT is to optimize return opportunities for on-chain users from real world assets. Launched by RWA DAO, stUSDT is operated by JustLend DAO under the custody agreement between the two parties. JustLend DAO boasts the highest TVL on TRON and ranks among the top DeFi projects. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USDT (over $46 billion) and a TVL second only to Ethereum, which will also drive the organic growth of stUSDT. The stUSDT team is confident to see an influx of new users and wider expansion of the TRON ecosystem at large.</p><p>Create the Web3 counterpart of Yu&rsquo;e Bao, combining the physical world with Web3</p><p>Current market participants are consistently devoting time and effort to stay ahead of the curve regarding any new tech or product developments in the crypto sphere, and the sheer size of market expansion over the past few years speaks volumes. The inception of liquidity mining during the "DeFi Summer" of 2020 has given rise to a booming decentralized lending market. Back then, in the realm of USD-pegged stablecoins, a deposit rate of 10% was hardly a surprise. When the real world interest rates were low, liquidity gravitated towards on-chain DeFi lending markets.</p><p>However, with a shift in market trends, some real world assets have now regained a much stronger position. For example, the US Fed Funds Rate has surged past 5%, making the dollar a sought-after risk-free asset. Under this latest macroeconomic backdrop, the DeFi sector has its eyes on RWAs in an attempt to venture into new markets.

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Geneva, Switzerland, July 4th, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>Today, the TRON ecosystem welcomes its first Real World Asset (RWA) product, stUSDT, which is operating through the decentralized platform JustLend. TRON founder and member of Huobi's global advisory board, Justin Sun, has voiced his belief that stUSDT will evolve into the crypto version of Alipay&rsquo;s Yu&rsquo;e Bao, a money market fund product offered by Alibaba. Sun is convinced that it will serve as a bridge connecting traditional markets to blockchain ecosystems while empowering crypto users with more options. From July 10 to August 10, 2023, the stUSDT platform is set to launch a welcome campaign offering an increased APY of up to 10% (normally expected to be around 5%) to enhance users&rsquo; first experience with RWAs on TRON. Users can also enjoy discounts on redemption fees of stUSDT from July 3 to August 10. Please refer to Medium for daily updates on the RWA fund allocation and rebases.</p><p>With a vast global user base and a $50 billion stablecoin market cap, stUSDT, a TRON-based RWA product, has sparked considerable industry excitement upon its introduction. It is primed to serve as a cornerstone for TRON's RWA endeavors and towards building a financial gateway that aims to empower 8 billion people worldwide.</p><p>TRON's RWA product unleashes new opportunities</p><p>Today, RWA is a popular concept in the crypto industry. The stUSDT platform is dedicated to narrowing the divide between retail and institutional investors while connecting the crypto realm with the real world. stUSDT ensures equal opportunities for all to invest in RWAs. This is the first endeavor in the TRON ecosystem to tokenize RWAs and introduce them to the community.</p><p>stUSDT, the TRON ecosystem's answer to stETH on the Lido protocol, is a decentralized token that serves as proof of investment in RWAs and its holders can earn passive incomes from real world assets. stUSDT introduces more decentralized and robust asset management mechanisms. The ultimate goal of stUSDT is to optimize return opportunities for on-chain users from real world assets. Launched by RWA DAO, stUSDT is operated by JustLend DAO under the custody agreement between the two parties. JustLend DAO boasts the highest TVL on TRON and ranks among the top DeFi projects. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USDT (over $46 billion) and a TVL second only to Ethereum, which will also drive the organic growth of stUSDT. The stUSDT team is confident to see an influx of new users and wider expansion of the TRON ecosystem at large.</p><p>Create the Web3 counterpart of Yu&rsquo;e Bao, combining the physical world with Web3</p><p>Current market participants are consistently devoting time and effort to stay ahead of the curve regarding any new tech or product developments in the crypto sphere, and the sheer size of market expansion over the past few years speaks volumes. The inception of liquidity mining during the "DeFi Summer" of 2020 has given rise to a booming decentralized lending market. Back then, in the realm of USD-pegged stablecoins, a deposit rate of 10% was hardly a surprise. When the real world interest rates were low, liquidity gravitated towards on-chain DeFi lending markets.</p><p>However, with a shift in market trends, some real world assets have now regained a much stronger position. For example, the US Fed Funds Rate has surged past 5%, making the dollar a sought-after risk-free asset. Under this latest macroeconomic backdrop, the DeFi sector has its eyes on RWAs in an attempt to venture into new markets. In traditional finance, Yu&rsquo;e Bao, Alipay's money market fund product, has become a handy investment vehicle. The TRON-based stUSDT is positioned as the Yu&rsquo;e Bao of Web3, whose debut unveils a new chapter for the TRON ecosystem to potentially replicate the success story of Alipay.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Co-founders of bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) plan to donate their future earnings from their new venture to creditors who lost money after 3AC went bankrupt last year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pledge was made during a Twitter Spaces event held on the 3rd of July, with co-founder Kyle Davis calling the effort a &ldquo;shadow recovery process.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
Donating For Karma&nbsp;
<p>According to Davis, co-founder of Three Arrows Capital, it would be good karma to donate potential earnings from their new venture, Open Exchange (OPNX), to creditors of the bankrupt hedge fund. The plan would be separate from the already ongoing liquidation proceedings that are currently underway and trying to recover any value from the bankrupt company and redistribute it amongst its creditors. Davis also claimed that some creditors of 3AC had already been made whole. Global consulting firm Teneo is managing the recovery process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Davis called the process the first of its kind, claiming that it would allow himself and another co-founder Su Zhu to donate funds to creditors, but only if they were supportive of their new venture, Open Exchange. Davis stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If there are some that don&rsquo;t want to deal with us, then they don&rsquo;t have to. We very much believe that if we do good and we say to creditors who lost money, they have a way to make more back. If we do bad and they do well, then that&rsquo;s great. And that&rsquo;s good karma, or whatever you want to call it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>When asked how he could be working on a new venture while Three Arrows Capital was still dealing with the liquidation process, Davies stated that there was a connection between the new venture and Three Arrows Capital creditors, who only stood to benefit from their new entrepreneurial endeavor.&nbsp;</p>
Crypto Community Unimpressed&nbsp;
<p>The comments were not well received by the larger crypto community, which is still reeling from the collapse and counting its losses. A spokesperson for the Three Arrows Capital liquidator, Teneo, stated in response to Davies&rsquo; comments,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The founders of Three Arrows have willfully ignored multiple requests to assist with this process after initiating the liquidation themselves, and the court records paint a clear picture of the ways in which they have hindered creditor recoveries. Instead of promising creditors future earnings from a nascent venture, we would recommend that the founders engage in the court-ordered activities already underway.&rdquo;</p>

The Controversial Open Exchange&nbsp;
<p>Davies and Su are currently working on OPNX and came under heavy criticism from the crypto community, who criticized them for coming up with a new venture while shirking their responsibilities to the creditors of 3AC. The Open Exchange is a trading platform that allows the trade of bankruptcy claims. The exchange has claimed on its website that there are currently 20 million users, with about $20 billion in claims.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This comes after several other major players, such as FTX and Celsius, have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after the rout in crypto. Davies claimed in the Spaces session that OPNX is currently seeing around $50 million in daily trading volume. So far, only claims from Celsius are tradeable on the platform. However, the website states that claims in the bankruptcies of Voyager, Genesis, BlockFi, FTX, Hodlnaut, Vauld, Zipmex, Mt. Gox, and even Three Arrows Capital would be added soon.&nbsp;</p>
The 3AC Bankruptcy&nbsp;
<p>Three Arrows Capital filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection on the 1st of July, 2022. Court documents later revealed that the collapsed hedge fund owed around $2.8 billion to over 20 different firms. Both Davies and Su&rsquo;s locations remain unknown, with creditors forced to use Twitter to serve them subpoenas. A report in the New York Times has claimed that both have been spending most of their time in Bali. On the 27th of June, creditors stated that they were looking to recover around $1.3 billion in lost funds from Davies.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BlackRock refiled its application for its iShares Bitcoin Trust exchange-traded fund (ETF) after the SEC found it inadequate.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq exchange has submitted an amended application for a Bitcoin spot ETF on behalf of BlackRock after the SEC found trouble with its initial attempt.</p>
Nasdaq Names Coinbase as Surveillance Partner
<p>In the newly submitted application, Nasdaq reached an agreement with crypto exchange Coinbase to enter into a surveillance-sharing agreement which will address one of the SEC&rsquo;s main objections to recent Bitcoin spot ETF filings. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The filing reads:</p>

<p>The Spot BTC SSA is expected to be a bilateral surveillance-sharing agreement between Nasdaq and Coinbase that is intended to supplement the exchange&rsquo;s market surveillance program.</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal reported last week that the SEC told Nasdaq and Cboe that recent ETF filings from BlackRock, Fidelity, and others were not &ldquo;clear and comprehensive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Senior Bloomberg Analyst Eric Balchunas soon tweeted that the SEC&rsquo;s main objection to the filings was that it needed the name of the crypto exchange for the &ldquo;surveillance-sharing agreement&rdquo; and required more details on the SSA.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Hold up a second, this isn't as bad as headline. The key paragraph is deep in story. Basically SEC wants them to name the "crypto exchange" and give more details on SSA. That's understandable, arguably good news. I was under impression they'd have to update that as well. pic.twitter.com/bh9qn65Xh2</p>
&mdash; Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 30, 2023
<p>

</p>
Firms Update ETF Filings
<p>BlackRock&rsquo;s proposed ETF will depend on Coinbase as its custodian and for its spot market data for pricing. Coinbase has also agreed to provide similar services to Fidelity, which is also applying for its own Bitcoin spot ETF.</p>
<p>BlackRock was the first to apply for a Bitcoin spot ETF on June 15, followed by filings from WisdomTree, Invesco, and finally, Fidelity.</p>
<p>Given the agency&rsquo;s hostile stance against crypto under its current chairman Gary Gensler, the SEC has not approved any Bitcoin spot ETFs.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s7">Uwerx is a new project seeking to reconceptualize the gig economy with its revolutionary features. This accounts for its presale success and the increased adoption it has been gaining. Due to these, analysts predict a bright future for the project, which has shown strong potential to keep soaring in the crypto winter. </p>
<p class="s7">On the other hand, Monolith (TKN) is struggling to beat bearish sentiments as the bears continue to dominate over the token. This article looks at Monolith&rsquo;s (TKN) predictions, what Uwerx is all about, and why you should quickly become a WERX holder.</p>
<p class="s9">&gt;&gt;BUY WERX TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
What The Charts Say About Monolith (TKN)
<p class="s7">The crypto market considers Monolith (TKN) a near-dead crypto as it has only recorded a few transactions or trading activities for a long time. This has caused Monolith (TKN) to see a huge plunge without signs of recovery. </p>
<p class="s7">Monolith (TKN) currently dines with the bear as it has remained at the bottom, with predictions showing it might record only a negligible price increase. Monolith (TKN) has declined by almost 5% in the past week, and further decline is imminent. </p>
<p class="s7">Monolith (TKN) is seeing increased selling pressure as most token holders quickly sell their tokens and move to more active platforms.</p>
<p class="s7">Monolith (TKN) Launched Its Visa Debit Card</p>
<p class="s7">Monolith (TKN) is a decentralized banking powered by Ethereum (ETH), enabling users to use its Visa debit card to store or spend their tokens globally. Monolith (TKN) provides a DeFicontract wallet where users can store their tokens and use the Visa debit card to make in-app crypto purchases. </p>
<p class="s9">&gt;&gt;BUY WERX TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
Uwerx (WERX) Continues Smashing Through Its Presale
<p class="s7">Uwerx's surging presale has been marveling, quickly reaching its final stage, stage 5. This exceeded initial predictions, and due to demands, WERX allocation for the presale was increased to 427,500,000 (57%). Stage 5 has 72,500,000 WERX available, and the total supply of WERX is 750,000,000.</p>
<p class="s7">The WERX price increase is more surprising. WERX started trading at $0.005 but is now at $0.047725, with more price increases unavoidable. Also, the WERX launch price was increased to $0.095 - $0.115 due to the token&rsquo;s rising value.</p>
<p class="s7">There is a 15% purchase bonus to increase users&rsquo; profits, and the presale ends on July 31. </p>
Uwerx (WERX) Has Leverage Over Other Freelancing Platforms
<p class="s7">Global gig workers are expected to reach 78 million in 2023. Hence, Uwerx is making significant moves to increase adoption and stand out from centralized platforms. It brings blockchain technology and a 1% service fee, features yet to be seen in freelancing. There is also the UwerxVault which promotes user rewards and engagement.</p>
<p class="s7">Its platform&rsquo;s Alpha version launched a few months back and has been gaining traction with more features added. The platform&rsquo;s features now include the Initial Step of Job Creation, My Activity Page, Initial Step of Finding Talent, Hiring Dashboard Page, Logging In and Sign-Up Pages, Freelancer or Client Initiation, Job Creation Process Page, and Forgot Password.</p>
<p class="s7">The Job Application Page was remodeled to the Post Job and Apply Page to quicken users' job applications. New features like the Tools and Client and Freelancer Dashboards are in the works. </p>
<p class="s7">Uwerx will transition to the Beta version, which is now in the works so users can test the platform themselves. InterFi Network and SolidProof have performed audit approvals on Uwerxto ensure its security. The platform has gained over 1,825 Telegram members, 1,652 Twitter followers, and 6,953 sign-ups.</p>
<p class="s7">The team's agile methodology to release the project in bits and modify the platform based on users' feedback has also contributed to the project&rsquo;s success. They are eager to hear from the community, and feedback can be emailed to feedback@uwerx.network. </p>
<p class="s7">To show their dedication to users, the team&rsquo;s token allocation is now only 7% following their decision to reduce it. For sustainability, they will forfeit ownership of the smart contract once the project becomes listed on centralized exchanges. Also, they began a nine-month liquidity lock on their tokens to prevent rug pulls. This started on June 7, after the 82.8% vote it received from the community to start immediately. </p>
<p class="s7">A Test Airdrop will be performed to verify wallet addresses for users, for which 98.2% of the community is in support.</p>
<p class="s7">Uwerx will be a force to reckon with in the freelancing industry. To do that, you have to become a WERX holder. It is best to do so now and maximize the 15% purchase bonus. </p>
