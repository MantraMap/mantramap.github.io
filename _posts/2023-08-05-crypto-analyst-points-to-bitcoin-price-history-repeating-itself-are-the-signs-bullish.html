The general crypto market has recorded a slight decline in the last week, with the market leader Bitcoin losing 0.78% of its value over the last seven days.   This price loss amplifies BTC’s negative monthly performance, pushing its total loss in the last 30 days to around 5.38%, according to data from CoinMarketCap. At the time of writing, the premier cryptocurrency is trading at around $29,022, with its daily trading volume valued at $10.746 billion, having gone down 12.54%.  However, amidst Bitcoin&#8217;s current downtrend, it appears the token&#8217;s larger performance could be indicating a bullish market in the coming months.

Thereafter, the token is expected to undergo a major re-correction finding support in the first week of November 2023.  Based on the reference price cycle, Bitcoin could then experience a significant price drop in the last month of 2023 but close the year in a strong consolidation zone.

However, all investors are reminded that predictions are not guaranteed and should not be considered as investment advice.  Rising Optimism In The BTC Market In other news, it appears there is a rising positive sentiment around Bitcoin, with a significant increase in its accumulation by key holders. According to a report by on-chain analytics firm Santiment, BTC whales and sharks are currently swapping their BUSD and DAI for more BTC.  Santiment noted the situation was quite the opposite back in July, with the BTC heavyweights shedding some of their holdings. However, the analytics firm reports that if the current trend is maintained, we could see BTC trade above $30,000 again.  Related Reading: Bitcoin NVT Shows Bearish Crossover, Price Drop Incoming?
