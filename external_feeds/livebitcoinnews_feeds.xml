										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Does blockchain going to space or taking over it sound foolhardy or impossible? According to a few different crypto companies, the <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/technology/blockchain-to-the-moon-crypto-companies-outer-space-plans-are-less-silly-than-you-think/ar-AA1dpHyn">idea isn’t as odd</a> as it might seem at first glance.</p>
<h2>Blockchain and Space&#8230; The Perfect Match?</h2>
<p>There are many crypto and blockchain companies out there that are very curious about the universe and what distributed ledger technology can do when it comes to space. One of those companies is Lunar Crush. It recently announced plans to rover over 200,000 miles to the moon with a private key etched onto the machine that would make its way through the final frontier.</p>
<p>This is like the plan that <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/elon-musk-wants-to-literally-leave-dogecoin-on-the-moon/">was initiated</a> by Elon Musk. Remember when he said he literally wanted to send Doge to the moon?</p>
<p>In addition to Lunar Crush, crypto startup Cryptosat said it’s working on something called “Space Wallet,” which it said would be used to secure crypto beyond the stars. There are also several other firms – including Filecoin, Space Chain, and Blockstream – that say they want to mix outer space with blockchain.</p>
<p>Cryptosat is a company that was founded by Yan Michalevsky and Yonatan Winetraub. They are pursuing doctoral degrees at Stanford, and the company has already sent two coffee mug-sized satellites into space. They were equipped with small computers that could perform computations and safeguard crypto. Michalevsky commented in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>Given the fact that they cannot be accessed physically, that can protect against very sophisticated attacks that are becoming relevant, especially in the blockchain and web3 space[s].</p></blockquote>
<p>Space Chain was founded by former BTC developer Jeff Garzik. It also has a few computers in space right now, and all are attached to satellites, a few of which have to do with the International Space Station. Talk about a big boost for blockchain! The company’s present CEO Cliff Beek said:</p>
<blockquote><p>A blockchain node or any other node in space that is off the terrestrial infrastructure creates an air gap for any access that&#8217;s unauthorized.</p></blockquote>
<p>Blocksteam was founded by Adam Back, who has close ties to Satoshi Nakamoto, the elusive founder of the bitcoin digital currency. The company has garnered more than $125 million at press time to expand its crypto mining facilities. It’s also leasing four satellites that are broadcasting to bitcoin’s blockchain. Back commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the promises of bitcoin is the ability to improve global access to remittances, finance, international transfers and things like that… Entrepreneurs and businesses in different parts of the world where bandwidth is more expensive will use this infrastructure to make it economically feasible.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Securing Files with Blockchain</h2>
<p>Moreover, Lockheed Martin – a defense contractor – is using Filecoin to secure inter-satellite communications.</p>
<p>The company is also launching an interplanetary file system to test its theories regarding blockchain’s abilities to secure satellite transmissions.</p>

<li>There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.2920 on the 4-hour chart (data feed via Coinbase).</li>
<li>The price could continue to move down if it stays below the $0.300 resistance zone.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Cardano price is struggling below $0.300 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-faces-uphill-task-near-30k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a>. ADA price could start a fresh increase if it clears the $0.300 and $0.305 resistance levels.</em></p>
<h2>Cardano Price Analysis</h2>
<p>This past week, Cardano price saw a rejection pattern near the $0.302 zone against the US Dollar. The ADA/USD pair declined below the $0.300 and $0.292 support levels.</p>
<p>The price even declined below the $0.288 support and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/cardano-ada-price-analysis-risk-of-more-downsides-below-0-30/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. It revisited the $0.2865 support zone. A low is formed near $0.2867 and the price is consolidating losses. It is now trading below $0.305 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</p>
<p>On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $0.290 zone or the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.3025 swing high to the $0.2865 low.</p>
<p>The first major resistance is near the $0.292 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.2920 on the 4-hour chart. The next key resistance could be $0.295 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.3025 swing high to the $0.2865 low.</p>
<p>A clear upside break above the $0.295 level might send the price toward the $0.300 resistance. Any more gains could start a steady increase toward the $0.315 level or even $0.320.</p>
<p>On the downside, immediate support is near the $0.2865 level. The next major support is near the $0.282 level, below which the price may perhaps decline toward the $0.265 support level. Any more losses might call for a test of the $0.250 level.</p>

</ul>
<p><em>Ethereum price is declining below $1,850 against the US Dollar. ETH/USD remains at a risk of more downsides below the $1,835 support zone.</em></p>
<h2>Ethereum Price Analysis</h2>
<p>This past week, Ethereum struggled to clear the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-eth-could-resume-increase-above-1885/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1,880 resistance zone</a> against the US Dollar. ETH price attempted a few times to clear the $1,880 level but failed.</p>
<p>A swing high was formed near $1,876 and the price started a fresh decline. There was a drop below the $1,860 and $1,850 support levels. There was a move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,800 swing low to the $1,876 high.</p>
<p>The pair even spiked below the $1,840 support. It is now trading below $1,850 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-eth-shows-bearish-signs-below-1900/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. On the upside, the price is now facing resistance near the $1,850 level. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,850 on the 4-hour chart.</p>
<p>The next major resistance is near the $1,880 level. The next major resistance is near the $1,900 zone. A clear move above the $1,880 and $1,900 resistance levels might call for a fresh move to $1,950. Any more gains could even send the price toward the $2,000 resistance zone or even $2,050 in the near term.</p>
<p>On the downside, initial support is near the $1,835 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,800 swing low to the $1,876 high.</p>
<p>The next major support is now near the $1,800 level. A break below the $1,800 support could push the price to $1,720. If the bulls fail to protect the $1,720 support, the price might decline toward $1,650.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a war occurring in the African nation of Sudan, and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/07/05/how-bitcoin-helps-civilians-escape-the-war-in-sudan/?sh=36f8f43e753e">bitcoin is helping residents</a> either survive the rough conditions or escape the nation to freedom.</p>
<h2>Sudan is in a Rough State</h2>
<p>The war in Sudan is relatively new, having only begun about four months ago (April of 2023). The conflict has been fueled by many financial issues including record-high inflation, which surged beyond the 350 percent mark in 2021. In addition, the Sudanese banking infrastructure has completely collapsed, and this has paved the way for <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/bitcoin/">bitcoin</a> to march in and save the day in certain cases.</p>
<p>A Sudanese expat that remains anonymous at the time of writing (and living in the country of Ireland) explained in a recent interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>It was almost impossible to send money back home. When my aunt called me about bitcoin, I understood that it could have implications beyond my own little online world.</p></blockquote>
<p>He commented that his parents and other family members who were fleeing the nation couldn’t take much with them. No cash, no gold, and it was up to him to find a way to help them start their new lives. That way involved BTC. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>They couldn’t take anything with them. No money, no gold, not even a mobile phone. Anything valuable would have been a serious threat to their life.</p></blockquote>
<p>This inspired him to start a company called Sudan Hodl, a remote crypto firm that has given way to a wide array of bitcoin-based meetups and training camps. He also runs a group called BTC Sudan, which presently houses 500 members on Discord. He says his organizations have helped hundreds of people escape the war since it began. He commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are traders, money exchangers, miners, and just regular people using bitcoin as savings. It’s an incredibly diverse community.</p></blockquote>
<p>He has also managed to raise quite a bit of money for the medical staffers in Sudan so they can help those who must remain behind for whatever reason. He mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>The medical situation is extremely dire. There is no humanitarian aid. Doctors are unable to purchase supplies. Some are using plastic bottles as chest drains.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Remittances Aren&#8217;t What They Once Were</h2>
<p>The war in the nation has two different caches going at it. One has large control over the government, while the other has primary control over the economy. For one side to win, they must control both sides. Sudan Hodl has put out a statement saying remittances have ultimately died in the nation over the past 17 years or so. The statement reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>Especially in the countryside, people have been working 16-18 hours a day and were still not able to make ends meet. People are desperate. When militias offered $500 to start fighting, it seemed like a good deal to them.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2023 has been a year of great turnaround for bitcoin and <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/bitcoin-bounces-back-cryptocurrency-rebounds-after-rough-2022/ar-AA1dk1wD">analysts are wondering</a> why.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Has Seen a Lot of Change This Year</h2>
<p>For one thing, it appears macroeconomic conditions have loosened up somewhat. While many financial experts still see an economic downturn happening towards the end of the year, talks of a recession of somewhat subsided. Still, things are shaky enough (with <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/analysts-provide-their-thoughts-on-latest-bitcoin-rally/">bank failures</a> and what not) that people have looked to bitcoin and similar assets as “safe havens” through which they can funnel their money and keep their investments safe.</p>
<p>Crypto expert Brandon Zemp explained also that while some regulatory issues have arisen in the U.S., the markets around the world have eased up when it comes to crypto, thus helping the industry grow at least from an international perspective. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think most of the prior price action bitcoin has had in the past has come largely from the United States, and for the first time, I think you’re seeing a lot of that price action start to happen outside of the United States.</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition, there’s also been a lot of interest stemming from Wall Street players <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/blackrock-etf-application-causes-btc-eth-to-surge/">such as BlackRock</a>, which recently filed a bitcoin ETF application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While the company had its application initially turned away for <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sec-sends-blackrock-btc-etf-application-back-for-revisions/">not being comprehensive</a> enough, the firm is now looking to revamp the application and resubmit it to the financial agency for a new opinion.</p>
<p>Konstantin Shulga – CEO and co-founder of Finery Markets – said this has to do with the public still showing massive interest in BTC even though it bombed hard last year. Shulga said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The world of cryptocurrency has been facing a lot of uncertainty in the U.S. market due to regulatory issues. However, despite these challenges, institutions have still been showing interest in it as an asset class. It seems that the adoption of cryptocurrency is slowly but surely taking place.</p></blockquote>
<p>Still, Shulga thinks that the regulatory scene in the U.S. is going to be quite stringent, and thus it may take at least a few attempts from BlackRock and similar companies to get the attention of the SEC. Shulga said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite numerous attempts, not a single application for a spot [exchange-traded fund] has received the green light from the SEC so far. The biggest question now is whether BlackRock&#8217;s filing will meet a different fate than previous proposals from companies like Fidelity or CBOE Global Markets, which were met with rejection(s).</p></blockquote>
<h2>More Growth Coming?</h2>
<p>Zemp anticipates bitcoin will continue to grow through the rest of the year, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think what will end up happening for bitcoin is we’ll see this continue to rise. Bitcoin could go to $35,000, $40,000, [or] $45,000 potentially. It will get closer and closer to its previous all-time high.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Crypto firm Bitcoin Suisse is confident <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/07/01/bitcoin-suisse-ceo-the-next-bull-market-is-coming-and-we-will-be-ready/?sh=3520585e3e8b">another big bull rally</a> is coming for bitcoin, and it wants to be prepared. It’s now reinventing itself as the ultimate “crypto asset manager” and trying to market its services to high-net-worth individuals that have a lot of digital currency to their names.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Suisse Sees a Huge Rally Coming</h2>
<p>Banking veteran and chief executive of Bitcoin Suisse Dirk Klee said in a recent interview that the recent washout of bad actors – including names like <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a> and <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/block-fi-is-the-latest-crypto-company-to-go-bankrupt/">Block Fi</a> – has cleaned the crypto house and paved the way for a bright and illustrious future. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Institutional players [need] to be safe places. So, on the back of the eruptions that we&#8217;ve seen in 2022, institutions have sharpened their focus on how to do proper risk management; who are the trusted partners; how deep do I have to go into technical details to understand the dynamics. With FTX, all the problems were traditional finance problems: misappropriation of client funds; no proper risk management; trading against client interests and so forth. Basic institutional standards were not being met. So, I think now, institutions want to go deeper. They want to do proper due diligence. They want to fully understand how [crypto companies] work; what we deliver; how we’re set up; are we safe, and that&#8217;s a good thing. There was hype in 2021. The market was getting ahead of itself, and the weaknesses of some players were exposed. I believe the washout is a healthy development.</p></blockquote>
<p>He also believes that bitcoin has been through the mill and is likely to experience steady growth over the coming years and be less vulnerable to volatility. He commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>Regulators have really stepped into this space. They’re providing safe rail guards for wider adoption and access to crypto, and the other thing is that some months ago, [western economies] left a 30-year cycle of lowering interest rates and cheap money pouring into the next higher-risk asset class… That money is no longer available. Investing is getting tougher for companies in this industry, and we [need] to prove that we have a sound business model. The actors are becoming sounder on the back of better risk management, hopefully, and the use-cases of the protocols are becoming clearer. The protocols also [need] to prove that they are delivering value. The hype and the money that flew into the hype has stopped. Now it gets real.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Why is BTC not Real Money Yet?</h2>
<p>Bitcoin Suisse also wants to see a day where bitcoin is looked at as real, valid money and it’s used to pay for everyday items. Klee stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>The notion of bitcoin as a means of payment for smaller transactions has not come true. It has not evolved for everyday use like buying a coffee at Starbucks.</p></blockquote>

<li>Stellar lumen price is struggling below the $0.150 resistance zone against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>XLM price is now trading below $0.150 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.140 on the 4-hour chart (data feed via Kraken).</li>
<li>The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $0.1420 resistance.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Stellar lumen price is trading below $0.150 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-faces-uphill-task-near-30k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a>. XLM price could extend losses if it trades below the $0.132 support.</em></p>
<h2>Stellar Lumen Price Analysis (XLM to USD)</h2>
<p>After a sharp decline below $0.165, Stellar Lumen price moved into a bearish zone against the US Dollar. The XLM/USD pair traded below the $0.150 level.</p>
<p>There was also a spike below the $0.135 support zone. A low was formed near $0.1332 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a move above the $0.135 and $0.138 levels. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1719 swing high to the $0.1332 low.</p>
<p>However, the bears were active near the $0.145 zone. XLM is now trading below $0.150 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/stellar-lumen-xlm-price-aims-fresh-increase-to-0-18/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.140 on the 4-hour chart.</p>
<p>The next key resistance is seen near the $0.142 level. A clear upside break above the $0.142 zone might send the price toward $0.150. Any more gains could lead the price toward the $0.1520 level or even 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1719 swing high to the $0.1332 low.</p>
<p>Initial support on the downside is near the $0.132 level. The next major support is near the $0.1250 zone. Any more losses could lead the price toward the $0.1120 level in the near term, below which the price might even retest $0.1050. The next major support is near $0.10.</p>

</ul>
<p><em>Ripple price is struggling below $0.665 against the US Dollar, unlike <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-faces-uphill-task-near-30k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a>. XRP price must stay above the $0.620 support to start a recovery wave.</em></p>
<h2>Ripple Price Analysis</h2>
<p>After struggling to stay above $0.680, Ripple price started a fresh decline against the US Dollar. The XRP/USD pair gained bearish momentum below the 0.665 support zone.</p>
<p>The bears were able to push the price below the $0.62 support. A low was formed near $0.5926 and the pair is now attempting a recovery wave. There was a test of the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.7346 swing high to the $0.5926 low.</p>
<p>The price is now trading near $0.625 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ripple-price-analysis-xrp-could-resume-slide-below-0-62/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.635 on the 4-hour chart of the XRP/USD pair.</p>
<p>On the upside, the price is facing resistance near $0.635. The next major resistance is near the $0.665 level. A clear move above the $0.665 resistance zone might start a steady increase. In the stated case, the price could test the $0.680 resistance.</p>
<p>The 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.7346 swing high to the $0.5926 low is near $0.680 to act as a barrier. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.720 resistance.</p>
<p>Initial support on the downside is near the $0.620 level. The next major support is near the $0.600 level, below which the price could accelerate lower toward the $0.5850 support. Any more losses could lead the price toward the $0.550 level.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The price of bitcoin fell as much as five percent at <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/bitcoin-price-sec-says-spot-etf-applications-blackrock-fidelity-inadequate-2023-6">the end of June and briefly</a> dipped below $30K (where it had been for the past few weeks) before rebounding. The reason? The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decided to pass up on the present versions of the BlackRock and Fidelity bitcoin-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications.</p>
<h2>The SEC is Again Disapproving a Bitcoin ETF</h2>
<p>The news might seem rough at first, though there’s still room to get things moving in the right direction. The SEC did not flat out reject the applications like it normally does. Rather, it described them as “inadequate,” and said that if the issuing companies were willing to make necessary changes, the applications would be reconsidered.</p>
<p>This opens a door of hope not just for both firms, but for the crypto industry. For too long, people have been waiting for a day in which a crypto-based ETF comes to market, and for the past several years, many companies have tried to make <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/perianne-boring-the-sec-needs-to-approve-a-btc-etf/">that dream come alive</a>.</p>
<p>However, the SEC has been rather stringent when it comes to crypto applications like these. It often says “no” <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-sec-issues-another-no-to-van-ecks-bitcoin-etf/">straight away</a>, and when it doesn’t, the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/valkyrie-bitcoin-etf-decision-delayed-until-january/">delays set in</a>… So much so, that many companies have simply withdrawn their applications before the financial agency even has a chance to look at them.</p>
<p>The SEC claims that both BlackRock and Fidelity have very strong histories to them, which is why it’s allegedly willing to reconsider new applications. However, you can’t help but wonder – given the agency’s background and track record – if this is just a method of buying time or drawing things out to the extent that it usually does.</p>
<p>The SEC has shown repeatedly it’s at war with the crypto industry. Gary Gensler and the lackies he surrounds himself with have gone after crypto companies both large and small. They don’t care about their reputations or how long they’ve been in business. Companies like <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sec-sues-binance-alleges-selling-of-illegal-securities/">Binance</a> and <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-hit-with-sec-lawsuit-says-it-operated-as-an-exchange-broker/">Coinbase</a> – two of the largest digital currency firms around today – are feeling the wrath of the agency, and it’s become something of a joke in recent days that nobody is safe, regardless of how powerful or experienced they might appear.</p>
<p>One of the most domineering crypto-based <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/is-the-sec-trying-to-kill-crypto-for-good/">lawsuits initiated by the SEC</a> was brought against Kraken. The firm was forced to pay $30 million in penalties. It was also made to cease all its crypto staking services and activities.</p>
<h2>Should We Calm Down?</h2>
<p>Chris Martin – head of research at Amber Data – believes that the present reaction to the SEC’s ruling is “overblown.” He commented that bullish <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/bitcoin-slips-after-sec-reportedly-calls-etf-filings-inadequate-but-still-heads-for-a-winning-month/ar-AA1dg7ri">signs still exist for many</a> digital assets and said:</p>
<blockquote><p>These tokens each have their own nuance and different reasons, but it&#8217;s reasonable to expect that market confusion is leading some to move into higher risk appetites.</p></blockquote>
