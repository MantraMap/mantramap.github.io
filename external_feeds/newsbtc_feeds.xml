					<description><![CDATA[APT, the native token of the Aptos Network, is currently making market waves as it prepares for its upcoming token release in July. According to data by CoinMarketCap, APT has gained by 10.14% in the last 24 hours, emerging as part of the top gainers in today’s market.  Aptos Anticipates New Token Release According to data from the token tracker site Token Unlocks,  4.54 million APT tokens, valued at $36.94 million, are scheduled to be released on July 12. This upcoming token release will account for 2.17% of the total circulating supply.  For investors familiar with the APT market, this is quite normal, as the Aptos Network is programmed to unlock new tokens on the 12th of each month. These tokens are released to the Aptos Foundation as well as its user community to support ecosystem projects, provide grants, and push other community growth initiatives.  Related Reading: Coinbase Stock Soars Nearly 12% As BlackRock Reveals Surveillance Partnership However, while APT is currently gaining, the effects of token release on the market are unpredictable, as seen in previous times. In January, APT witnessed a jump of over 50% following the scheduled unlock but fell by 13% in February after the same event occurred. Following the launch of the Aptos Mainnet in October 2022, the total supply of APT tokens stood at 1 billion. Of this amount, data from Token Unlocks shows that 166.35 million APT tokens have been unlocked so far, representing only 17% of the total supply. APT Price Analysis On Saturday, October 19, 2022, the Aptos (APT) token made an impressive debut in the crypto market, reaching a market price of $100.  However, this was followed by a sharp downturn as the price plunged to the $3.5 level. Over the next three months, APT gradually recovered and climbed to the $20.00 price zone, where it was resisted.  Since then, the token has experienced an overall bearish trend losing over 58% of its value to date. APT Trading At $8.15 On The 1-Hour Chart &#124; Source: APTUSD Chart On Tradingview.com Looking at the APT hourly chart, the token’s current price movement suggests it has encountered a resistance zone at the price level of $8.33. If APT is able to break through this barrier, it will continue its bullish momentum and possibly trade as high as $8.82, which appears to be the next resistance zone.  Related Reading: USDC Circulating Supply Down 38% Since Jan. 1 – Will It Affect Price? However, failure to push past the $8.33 price mark may induce a bearish trend with the possibility of the token falling to a market price of $7.14, which represents the next support level.  At the time of writing, APT is currently trading at $8.1556, with a 0.17% decrease in the last hour. The token’s daily trading volume is also up by $276 million, with a 137% gain. Aptos stands as the 33rd biggest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $2 billion.  Featured Image from iStock, chart from Tradingview]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Stablecoins, the digital assets designed to maintain a stable value, have long been viewed as a potential bridge between the cryptocurrency world and the traditional financial industry. However, recent developments have cast a shadow of uncertainty over their perceived stability.  As global policymakers continue to grapple with concerns about the crypto sector&#8217;s impact on the established financial system, a surprising twist occurred when stress in the US banking industry reverberated throughout the stablecoin market.  According to Fitch Ratings, the tightening of financial conditions, culminating in the high-profile failures of several banks, notably including the collapse of the esteemed Silicon Valley Bank, had a profound impact on stablecoins.  Stablecoins: Market Shakeup For instance, Fitch Ratings reports that the market capitalization of USD Coin (USDC), a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar at a 1:1 ratio, experienced a sharp decline of over 25% in the first quarter. Although the coin&#8217;s value remains depressed, Fitch noted that it managed to recover its peg soon after.  Related Reading: Dwindling Optimism (OP) Value May Be A Result Of This Factor According to data from The Block, the total supply of stablecoins has decreased from $138 billion at the beginning of the year to $124 billion as of July 3. This decline in supply further underscores the challenges faced by stablecoins and their struggle to maintain stability amidst market turbulence. Chart: The Block Crypto Data “Significant volatility, shaken investor confidence, and temporary but sharp de-pegging occurred in the stablecoin market in March as shockwaves spread from traditional finance,” Fitch wrote. Tether Bucks Trend In contrast to USDC, Tether, another prominent stablecoin, observed a 12% increase in its market capitalization during the same period. Notably, Tether captured approximately 72% of USDC&#8217;s redemption volume, indicating a growing preference for Tether among investors. Related Reading: Litecoin $100 Milestone Indicates Promising Bullish Trends – Here’s Why Despite Tether&#8217;s positive performance, the top 10 stablecoins experienced a decline in their monthly average of daily trading volumes. From March to May 2023, these trading volumes decreased from $53 billion to $28 billion. This reduction signifies a decrease in activity within the stablecoin market, possibly driven by cautious investor sentiment in the face of ongoing market uncertainties. Bitcoin approaches the $31K territory on the daily chart: TradingView.com Fitch noted that efforts to regulate stablecoins have been unfolding at varying speeds in the United States and Europe, leading to notable differences in the reporting and transparency standards of these digital assets. The contrasting approaches taken by the two regions have resulted in distinct regulatory landscapes for stablecoins, causing direct consequences on their reporting and transparency practices.

					<description><![CDATA[After Bitcoin reached a new yearly high at $31,413, the buy side has so far failed to initiate a trend-following move north. Although the bulls fended off a sell-off last Friday in the wake of the SEC&#8217;s perceived concerns over a Bitcoin spot ETF approval, the momentum seems to be increasingly flattening, or isn&#8217;t it? What&#8217;s Next For The Bitcoin Price? As the market awaits an approval from the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), investors are seemingly exercising caution. While open interest in the Bitcoin futures market continues to rise, activity in the spot market has recently declined. This shift indicates that price action in recent days has been primarily influenced by futures traders. Analyst @52Skew noted on Twitter, &#8220;$BTC Spot CVDs &#38; Delta: Quite a bit of spot still being dumped on the market + no limit chasing today from coinbase buyers. Spot bid liquidity $30.5K.&#8221; Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Stampede: Bitfinex Report Points To Early Signs Of Bull Market This observation underscores the reluctance of investors in the spot market who may be waiting for a decisive move by the SEC. However, it should be noted that US markets were closed yesterday for the 4th of July holiday. Most recently, huge spot buying volume came from Coinbase, pushing the market up. So today will be interesting to watch if yesterday&#8217;s retracement is bought today by US investors. Bitcoin dominance, which had risen to resistance at 52.15%, has now consolidated somewhat, dropping to 51.25%. This consolidation, combined with the entry of investors into the altcoin sector, reinforces the prevailing wait-and-see attitude among investors. Analyzing the Bitcoin price, it is clear that the market is currently facing strong resistance in the $31,300 to $31,416 range. The support area at $30,700 is currently proving to be a critical mark to watch. Holding above this support could give buyers the opportunity to launch a renewed offense. If the Bitcoin price can break out dynamically above the year-to-date high, the next major chart hurdle awaits at $32,500. Yet, a temporary retracement to the support area at $29,800 could be acceptable to gain momentum for the next breakout attempt. Related Reading: 75% Of Bitcoin Supply Now In Profit, Will A Drop Happen Here? So far, the bears have lacked follow-through. The sell side also failed in its attempt to sell off the BTC price in the higher time frames back below the psychologically important $30,000 level in recent days. The goal of the bears must be to push Bitcoin permanently below $29,800. Experts Remain Bullish For Now Renowned analyst Josh Rager believes the pullbacks won&#8217;t be as deep as many experts expect, suggesting that ETF approval, particularly from BlackRock, is a real possibility. He says, &#8220;Only an ETF rejection can cause pain, but I think BlackRock will be approved this time,&#8221; adding: The $24k, then up sentiment seems to be quite popular. I think people are overthinking it. Similar was said about Bitcoin needing to sweep $20k first. IMO, pullbacks won&#8217;t be this deep now and if we manage to see $25k again it won&#8217;t be until later on in the year after more upside before so. Similarly, NewsBTC lead analyst Tony &#8220;The Bull&#8221; believes in the bullish case for BTC in the near term. However, he stresses the importance of Bitcoin&#8217;s Relative Strength Index (RSI) entering overbought territory, as a failure to do so could indicate a lack of strong upside momentum: I want to see Bitcoin RSI push into overbought conditions by week end, or else I worry that this isn&#8217;t an impulse yet. We have a doji on the weekly, which signals indecision. We need to see follow through this week, or more correction becomes more probable w/ possible bear div.

<li>The pair could start a fresh increase if it stays above the $30,650 support zone.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bitcoin Price Remains Stable</h2>
<p>Bitcoin price struggled to clear the key <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-key-trend-32k/?swcfpc=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">$31,400 resistance zone</a>. BTC started a downside correction below the $31,000 and $30,800 levels.</p>
<p>The price declined below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $30,192 swing low to the $31,372 high. However, the bulls were seen active near the $30,650 support zone and the 100 hourly Simple moving average.</p>
<p>Bitcoin also tested the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $30,192 swing low to the $31,372 high. It is now trading above $30,700 and the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-holds-strong-30k/?swcfpc=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">100 hourly Simple moving average</a>.</p>
<p>There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $30,700 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Immediate resistance is near the $31,050 level. The first major resistance is near the $31,250 level, above which the price might start rise toward $31,400.</p>

<p>A close above the $31,400 resistance could start another strong increase. The next major resistance is near the $32,000 level. Any more gains could open the doors for a move toward the $32,500 resistance zone.</p>
<h2>More Losses in BTC?</h2>
<p>If Bitcoin’s price fails to clear the $31,050 resistance, it could continue to move down. Immediate support on the downside is near the $30,650 level and the trend line and the 100 hourly Simple moving average.</p>
<p>The next major support is near the $30,470 level, below which there could be a drop toward $30,200. Any more losses might send the price toward the $30,000 zone, under which there is a risk of a larger decline.</p>
<p>Technical indicators:</p>
<p>Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bullish zone.</p>
<p>Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is below the 50 level.</p>
<p>Major Support Levels – $30,650, followed by $30,200.</p>
<p>Major Resistance Levels – $31,050, $31,400, and $32,000.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Luminex, a Bitcoin Ordinals launchpad, has proposed a new standard called BRC-69, which will allegedly optimize the costs of inscribing on this network. This proposal comes barely a month after Bitcoin Ordinals’ developers introduced recursive inscriptions to address the block size limit of 4 MB. Unlike normal Ordinals inscriptions, recursive inscriptions can reference each others’ content through a special syntax. Related Reading: 75% Of Bitcoin Supply Now In Profit, Will A Drop Happen Here? BRC-69 Standard Can Reduce Inscription Fees By 90%: Luminex On Monday, June 3, Luminex introduced BRC-69, a new standard that will facilitate the creation of Recursive Ordinals collections. According to the launchpad, this BRC standard will help reduce inscription fees by 90%. In March 2023, the Ordinals protocol was updated to enable the minting of BRC-20 tokens, which have seen a significant level of adoption so far. According to data from Coingecko, there are currently 35,528 BRC-20 tokens in circulation, with a market cap of more than $249 million.  The increasing number of BRC-20 inscriptions has led to a scarcity of block space on the Bitcoin network. Consequently, BTC transaction fees have increased as there are more pending transactions. A quarterly report by IntoTheBlock revealed that the Bitcoin network fees surged by more than 300% in 2023 Q2. The BRC-20 standard &#8211; and the creation of new tokens &#8211; were reported to be one of the major driving forces of the increased on-chain fees. To ease this pressure on the network, Luminex has developed the BRC-69 standard, which it claims to be a &#8220;revolutionary standard&#8221;. It will help reduce the cost of inscriptions while helping to optimize the Bitcoin block space as the number of inscriptions rises, according to the launchpad. BRC-69 Standard To Cut Inscription Fees In 4 Steps The BRC-69 standard reduces inscription fees in a four-step process of “inscribe traits”, “deploy collection”, “compile collection”, and “mint assets”, Luminex claims. This means that minters only need to inscribe a single line of text instead of a full image. This text will serve as a reference, enabling the final image to be automatically rendered across Ordinals frontends, only using on-chain resources. “The end result? A flawlessly rendered image. Unlike other SVG recursive collections, these images can be dragged, dropped, and saved as typical image type Ordinals,” Luminex said. BTCUSD trading at $30,879 &#124; Source: BTCUSD chart from TradingView In addition to cost efficiency, Luminex’s proposal claims that the BRC-69 standard offers high flexibility and paves the way for other on-chain features. Some of these features include pre-reveal collection launching and on-chain reveals. It is worth mentioning that the Bitcoin Ordinals are still controversial in the cryptocurrency industry, as a large percentage of the Bitcoin community is opposed to the protocol. Many argue that this technology negatively impacts the efficiency and security of the Bitcoin network.

					<description><![CDATA[A trader’s big bet against Ethereum caused him to lose a big chunk of his $2 million margin. Considering the firm and steady increment of ETH prices over the last few weeks, more could be at stake.  In a series of screenshots shared on July 3 on Reddit, one trader on GMX has been aggressively “shorting” Ethereum with high leverage, a decision that has seen the trader lose hundreds of thousands in USD. GMX is a popular decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that allows users to trade perpetual futures contracts, including those of ETH, with up to 50x leverage.  Ethereum Prices Up 20% In 2 Weeks Despite facing significant losses from the forced liquidation of their shorts, the trader appears unfazed and continues to double down, shorting with high leverage without concern. Since mid-June 2023, Ethereum prices have been rising, expanding 20% at spot rates. Floating above previous liquidation levels at around $1,900, the coin is now trading at about $1,945.Although buyers were unable to drive up spot rates further, the bulls are still in charge. The psychological price point of $2,000 is still the immediate resistance level, along with the April 2023 highs at $2,100. Sparked by fundamental activities and mostly confidence from the broader cryptocurrency community, Ethereum has been marching higher, tracking the performance of Bitcoin. The direct correlation of prices versus the USD between Bitcoin and Ethereum could have benefited bulls during the rally.   Related Reading: Federal Reserve Certifies 57 Organizations For Instant Payments System ‘FedNow’ Comments from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), alleging that some of the native currencies of some of Ethereum’s competitors, including Algorand, Cardano, and Solana, are unregistered securities could have provided tailwinds for ETH, cementing its positions as a leading smart contracts platform. The SEC’s representatives, especially its chair, Gary Gensler, have remained non-committal in readily classifying the status of ETH. Any clarification could boost prices or force a sell-off depending on the agency&#8217;s classification. Trader’s Doubling Down on ETH Shorts Despite the steady rise of ETH over the past two weeks, the trader, records reveal, has been shorting ETH from when it was at around $1,700 to spot rates. However, the trader began aggressively shorting ETH from June 26.  In total, the trader opened two positions. One with a leverage of 19X was for $12 million, while the other with a leverage of 7X was for $1 million. As prices increased, the collateral representing $12 million from the 19X leverage position was closed. This didn’t stop the trader from opening another position. According to his trading history, another short position with a stop at $1,999 was opened, with leverage of 30X.

All that’s evident is that the coin’s price has been firm, defying sellers who have been active from mid-April through to the first half of June. In the medium term, the $2,000 and $2,100 liquidation levels are critical price points that could shape ETH’s trajectory in the second half of 2023.

					<description><![CDATA[The ssv.network has finally announced the launch of its mainnet, bringing a decentralized Ethereum (ETH) staking infrastructure to the Ethereum network. The launch follows more than two years of testing and refining, and the network is poised to revolutionize the staking industry. SSV Network&#8217;s Decentralized Infrastructure The ssv.network&#8217;s mainnet rollout plan includes four phases, each with its goals and provisions. The first phase, beginning in early Q2 2023, ensures that all mainnet parameters are correctly configured.  The second phase will introduce a complete set of verified operators, while the third phase will introduce builders utilizing the ssv.network infrastructure. Finally, the fourth phase will be the permissionless launch, inviting anyone to use the open protocol to build or stake. Related Reading: TRX Bulls Charge Ahead As Tron Network Prepares For Major Upgrade According to the announcement, the phased approach to the rollout is necessary to ensure that all the various actors and stakeholders in the network are aligned. But what are the benefits of this for the future of ETH staking? Decentralization: The ssv.network is a decentralized and permissionless network that aligns with the core principles of Ethereum. By embracing this vision, the network aims to bolster Ethereum&#8217;s resilience and empower the community to shape the future of staking. Fault tolerance: The ssv.network has been built to tackle fundamental Ethereum validator challenges, including fault tolerance. The network is designed to be resilient and able to handle failures in a decentralized manner. Security: The ssv.network has been designed to be secure, with multiple layers of security protocols to ensure the network is safe from attacks. Zero-coordination: The ssv.network has been designed to be a zero-coordination network, meaning that validators do not need to coordinate to validate blocks. Instead, the network uses a mesh-like structure that allows validators to validate blocks independently. Using the ssv.network for staking ETH provides a secure, resilient, and decentralized way to participate in the Ethereum network. The network&#8217;s focus on fault tolerance, security, zero-coordination, diversity, and its self-sustaining ecosystem, makes it an attractive option for anyone looking to stake ETH in the future. Shanghai Hardfork Sparks Surge In ETH Staking Deposits The recent implementation of the Shanghai hard fork has resulted in a surge in Ethereum staking deposits, according to analytics firm Glassnode.  The hard fork, activated on June 2nd, introduced several changes to the Ethereum network, including updates to the gas fee structure and EIP-1559. This new transaction fee mechanism aims to improve the user experience by reducing transaction fees and improving predictability. Glassnode&#8217;s data shows that deposit activity for staking ETH peaked on June 2nd, with over 13,595 new deposits worth over 408,000 ETH.  This surge in staking deposits suggests that investors and users are gaining confidence in Ethereum&#8217;s flexibility following the implementation of the hard fork. Staking allows users to earn rewards by holding and validating transactions on the network, and the recent surge in deposits indicates that more users are becoming interested in this process to participate in the network and earn passive income. Related Reading: 75% Of Bitcoin Supply Now In Profit, Will A Drop Happen Here? In contrast to staking deposits, ETH exchange deposit transactions remained flat at around 30,000 during the same period. This suggests that investors and users choose to hold and stake their ETH rather than trade or sell it on exchanges.  This is a positive sign for the Ethereum network, as staking provides a more stable and secure way to participate, compared to trading on exchanges, which can be subject to market volatility. As of the time of writing, ETH is trading at $1,948, struggling to break through the upper resistance level of $1,990. Over the last 24 hours, the cryptocurrency market has experienced a pullback, and ETH has declined by 0.8%. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>
