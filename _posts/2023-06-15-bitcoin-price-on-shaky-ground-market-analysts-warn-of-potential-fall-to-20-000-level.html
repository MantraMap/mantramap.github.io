Bitcoin, the world&#8217;s largest crypto by market cap, is currently under pressure, as it broke the significant $25,000 mark in the last 24 hours. This development has spurred a sense of urgency among traders and market analysts who are bracing for a possible further dip in the value of Bitcoin (BTC). At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $24,872. The past week has been less than favorable for the cryptocurrency. The asset has plunged 4.2% in the past 24 hours, pushing its price to trade below $25,000. This downward trend has negatively impacted Bitcoin&#8217;s weekly performance, resulting in a 6% loss. Traders And Analysts Voice Concerns Several traders and analysts have shared their predictions for the leading cryptocurrency in response to its downturn. Notably, a trader identified as Bluntz conveyed that the critical test for Bitcoin would be to reclaim the $25,600 mark in the ensuing days.  Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) Stored On Exchanges Plummets Amid Regulatory Uncertainties: Santiment In another corner, a trader called Rekt Capital raised concerns about a possible slide of Bitcoin&#8217;s price to lower $20,000. This prediction followed Bitcoin&#8217;s break below another weekly support level situated around $26,600. If Bitcoin faces rejection at this price point in the next few days, Rekt Capital posits that BTC will likely descend to the $20,000 level. Meanwhile, CryptoCon, another analyst, offered his perspective on the Bitcoin situation. In his tweet, CryptoCon pointed out an interesting correlation with the past, stating that Bitcoin found resistance at $31,000, which was also a key resistance level back in 2016. According to his analysis, not only did BTC meet rejection at this resistance level, but it also found support when the price broke below its current all-time high.  Bitcoin Latest Price Action It is worth noting that Bitcoin has been in a notable bearish trend in the past week. The largest crypto asset by market capitalization has recorded a downward movement falling by more than 5% in the past 7 days. BTC has continued the downtrend over the past 24 hours, seeing a 4.2% loss. At the time of writing, BTC trades at $24,925 after moving slightly above $26,000 on Sunday.
