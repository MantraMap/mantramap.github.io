In this issue, Argentina settles part of its $44 billion debt with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) using the Chinese yuan, Central Bank of Brazil officials estimate the Brazilian central bank digital currency (CBDC) will be available by 2024, and Bitfinex launches a Latam-focused P2P platform.</strong></p>
<h2>Argentina Settles Part of IMF Payment in Chinese Yuan</h2>
<p>Argentina keeps implementing the Chinese yuan as part of its national and international economy. Besides <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/argentina-allows-banks-to-open-yuan-accounts-economist-says-it-could-boost-chinese-currency-as-safe-haven-alternative-to-us-dollar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adopting</a> it as a recognized currency to open bank accounts due to the limited supply of U.S. dollars in the economy, the country is now using it to settle debts with international institutions. According to the state news agency Telam, the Central Bank of Argentina <a href="https://www.telam.com.ar/notas/202306/632533-gobierno-pago-fmi.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disbursed</a> part of a $2.7 billion payment to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) using the Chinese yuan.</p>
<p>$1.7 billion were paid using Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), an international reserve asset created by the IMF, and $1 billion was disbursed using part of a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/argentina-to-expand-de-dollarization-efforts-seeks-extension-of-yuan-based-swap-line-with-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">swap line</a> provided by the Chinese government. With China&#8217;s help, Argentina fulfilled its obligations to the IMF without touching its dwindling dollar-denominated reserves.</p>
<p>Argentinian government officials will <a href="https://www.telam.com.ar/notas/202307/632689-negociacion-fmi-deuda.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">travel</a> to Washington to negotiate an agreement to reprogram the remaining payments of the $44 billion Argentina owes the organization.</p>
<h2>Brazilian CBDC to Be Launched in 2024</h2>
<p>While the Brazilian digital currency is now entering a new pilot test phase, experts are speculating about when it will be launched for general audiences. At Fetraban Tech, a fintech event, two different experts gave their <a href="https://www.criptonoticias.com/comunidad/adopcion/real-digital-bajo-revision-brasil-riesgo-privacidad-libertad-financiera/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predictions</a> on the timeline of the launch of the Brazilian central bank digital currency (CBDC).</p>
<p>Larissa Moreira, Itau Unibanco&#8217;s CBDC coordinator, declared that the specs of the digital real could be determined in February as the team is currently studying how its architecture can be configured to comply with existing privacy and data protection regulations. However, Fabio Araujo, Central Bank of Brazil&#8217;s digital real project coordinator, noted that the population might start to use the product in 2024.</p>

<h2>Bitfinex Launches P2P Platform in Venezuela, Argentina, and Colombia</h2>
<p>Bitfinex, a cryptocurrency exchange, <a href="https://www.bitfinex.com/posts/934" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the launch of a peer-to-peer (P2P) platform directed to customers in Venezuela, Argentina, and Colombia. The platform will allow the customers to trade bitcoin, usdt, xaut (Tether Gold), and ether directly with other traders, using different payment options.</p>
<p>Paolo Ardoino, CTO of Bitfinex, <a href="https://twitter.com/bitfinex/status/1673722391095123970?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By offering a reliable and efficient platform for P2P token trading, we are empowering our customers to engage with the marketplace in a way that affords maximum convenience based on their needs and preferences.</p>

According to the Ethiopian Foreign Affairs Ministry, joining the bloc would help the country guarantee its national interests. </strong></p>
<h2>Safeguarding Ethiopian National Interests</h2>
<p>Ethiopia, which has one of Africa’s fastest-growing economies, has become the latest African country to seek to join the Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa (BRICS) economic bloc. The North East African country, which has waged a bloody war against Tigray rebels, joins <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/egypt-applies-for-brics-membership-seeks-trade-in-national-currencies/">Egypt</a> and Algeria in seeking to join BRICS.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/business/ethiopia-applies-to-join-brics-bloc-of-emerging-economies-4288736">report</a> in The East African, the country’s Foreign Affairs ministry believes joining a global institution such as BRICS will help advance Ethiopian national interests.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a country that has been a founding member of global institutions like the AU [African Union] and the UN [United Nations], and as we seek to guarantee our national interests, it is important to join blocs like BRICS,&#8221; the ministry reportedly said.</p>
<p>Ethiopia, like its counterpart Egypt, has grappled with shortages of foreign exchange and has seen the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-gap-between-ethiopian-currencys-official-and-parallel-market-exchange-rate-grows-to-new-record/">gap</a> between the official and parallel market exchange rate of its currency versus the U.S. dollar widen to a record high. The National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) has attempted to remedy the situation by <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ethiopian-central-bank-restricts-the-amount-of-cash-that-should-held-by-travelers-to-and-from-the-country/">imposing</a> limits on the amount of U.S. dollars that residents can take outside the country.</p>
<p>However, by joining BRICS which is planning to launch an alternative reserve currency, Ethiopia hopes to reduce its dependence on the greenback. The country’s wish to join BRICS is coming at a time when some African nations are seeking to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/kenyan-president-william-ruto-urges-african-countries-to-commence-process-to-ditch-the-dollar/">diminish</a> the influence of the U.S. dollar in intra-continental trade.</p>

The billionaire &#8220;has no idea the DARPA rattlesnake he just stepped on by doing this,&#8221; a censorship expert stressed, revealing that the U.S. censorship industry needs to &#8220;scrape hundreds of millions of tweets&#8221; in order to &#8220;build their social media censorship death star.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Twitter Imposes Rate Limits Citing &#8216;Extreme Levels of Data Scraping&#8217;</h2>
<p>Tesla CEO and Twitter chief Elon Musk has stirred up controversy by implementing temporary rate limits on the number of tweets users can read daily. The billionaire explained in a tweet on Saturday that these limits were introduced to combat excessive data scraping and system manipulation on the social media platform.</p>
<p>Verified Twitter accounts can read up to 6,000 posts per day, while unverified accounts are limited to 600 posts, and new unverified accounts can only read 300 posts per day, according to Musk&#8217;s initial announcement. The Tesla boss further tweeted that the rate limits would soon be increased to 8,000 for verified users, 800 for unverified users, and 400 for new unverified users. Subsequently, the billionaire stated that the limits would be further raised to 10,000, 1,000, and 500 respectively.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-596057 aligncenter" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/musk-twitter-rate-limit1.jpg" alt="" width="802" height="601" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/musk-twitter-rate-limit1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/musk-twitter-rate-limit1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/musk-twitter-rate-limit1.jpg 802w" sizes="(max-width: 802px) 100vw, 802px" /></p>
<p>Many people slammed Musk for introducing the rate limits. &#8220;This is a terrible move by Musk. User engagement and interactions will drastically decline,&#8221; one warned. &#8220;A social media that is trying to limit engagement is not a place that is welcoming its users &#8230; on that note bye,&#8221; another wrote.</p>
<p> CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) offered his advice on the matter: “Viewing should not be limited. Posting and commenting should be. No humans post more than 800 posts per day.” In a follow-up tweet, he revised his suggestion: “Actually, only commenting need to be limited. IMO.”</p>
<h2>Musk Steps on the DARPA Rattlesnake, Says Censorship Expert</h2>
<p>The decision to impose daily limits followed a rising trend of AI programs massively scraping tweets, including the widely used Chatgpt. Following the implementation of the limits by Twitter, users reported that Chatgpt informed them that it could <a href="https://twitter.com/WholeMarsBlog/status/1675376517537480705">no longer</a> access tweets.</p>
<p>Referencing the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), a research and development agency of the U.S. Department of Defense responsible for the development of emerging technologies for use by the military, Mike Benz, executive director of the Foundation for Freedom Online, <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeBenzCyber/status/1675254646942896128">tweeted</a> Saturday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Musk has no idea the DARPA rattlesnake he just stepped on by doing this.</p></blockquote>
<p>Commenting on the new Twitter rate limit controversy &#8220;from the perspective of the censorship industry,&#8221; he claimed that what Musk did has &#8220;wide-ranging implications for the science of censorship,&#8221; noting that &#8220;AI censorship is where all of the magic happens.&#8221;</p>
<p>Benz explained that the Twitter files revealed that while the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) could potentially censor 22 tweets, AI technology, such as Enterprise Intelligence Platform (EIP) and other censorship groups, enabled the censorship of 22 million tweets. “It&#8217;s a completely different animal. You could not censor the internet before 2016 at the kind of scale that you do now because you have AI censorship models … There&#8217;s an AI censorship death star that has been under construction, innovation, and renovation every week, every month, every year, for the past six, seven years now,” he detailed. “It all relies on massive scraping of Twitter data in order to build these models and databases to track trending narratives, to systematically surveil and build intelligence dossiers, and to track and to turn down, all at once, communities online.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 200;"></span></p>
<p>The Foundation for Freedom Online&#8217;s executive director added that these AI models “map real-time narrative emergence on Twitter in a way you can&#8217;t do on any other social media platform,” noting that they have been used by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the state department, the defense department, hundreds of government-funded NGOs, centers, and non-profit foundations. He emphasized:</p>
<blockquote><p>In order to build their social media censorship death star, they need to scrape hundreds of millions of tweets.</p></blockquote>
<p>Benz asserted that on the one hand what Musk is doing is “limiting the openness of the internet,” but on the other hand he is “actually, potentially preserving the openness of the internet by preventing the construction of this censorship death star that is getting more and more refined every day, and is getting funded by your tax dollars to the tune of tens of millions of dollars from DARPA, and the National Science Foundation, to say nothing about the state department and the National Endowment for Democracy grants.”</p>
<p>While Benz stated he is not sure whether Musk is restricting Twitter views “to throttle the AI censorship death star” or whether he is doing it to “pump up the subscription base, or a privacy reason, independent of censorship,” he stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>Whether Musk knows it or not, he has stepped on a rattlesnake … There are going to be hundreds of censorship operatives, housed within the university research centers, this week howling at the moon that this is an attack on democracy for Musk to limit their access.</p></blockquote>
<p>“If they lose access to the underlying data on which their AI censorship models are built, then they will not be able to do their jobs as effective, fast, precise, and comprehensive asocial media censors,” Benz clarified.</p>

Maintaining an optimistic outlook, Draper still expects the world&#x2019;s largest cryptocurrency to reach his predicted price target but acknowledged that it may take &#x201C;a little longer.&#x201D;</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Tim Draper&#x2019;s $250K Bitcoin Price Forecast</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Venture capitalist Tim Draper has adjusted the projected timeframe for his bitcoin price prediction. He tweeted Friday that when the price of bitcoin was $4,000, he predicted that it would climb 60 times and reach $250,000 by now. However, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> ended June below $31,000. &#x201C;I guess we have to wait a little longer,&#x201D; he wrote, adding that it may take two more years for his $250K prediction to come true.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-596009 aligncenter" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tim-draper-bitcoin-price-prediction-tweet.jpg" alt="" width="817" height="327" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tim-draper-bitcoin-price-prediction-tweet-300x120.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tim-draper-bitcoin-price-prediction-tweet-768x307.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tim-draper-bitcoin-price-prediction-tweet.jpg 817w" sizes="(max-width: 817px) 100vw, 817px">&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Draper previously predicted that the price of bitcoin would reach <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/venture-capitalist-tim-draper-doubles-down-on-his-250k-by-2022-bitcoin-price-prediction/">$250K by the end of 2022</a>. However, he acknowledged on Dec. 31, 2022, that his &#x201C;$250k by 2022&#x201D; forecast for bitcoin was &#x201C;off by a bit.&#x201D; Nonetheless, he insisted that the price of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> will &#x201C;certainly&#x201D; reach the predicted level before the halving in 2024.&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">See t-shirt. $250k by 2022. My prediction was off by a bit. Hasn&#x2019;t made it there&#x2026;yet.

<p>&#x2014; Tim Draper (@TimDraper) <a href="https://twitter.com/TimDraper/status/1609281214871146496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 31, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
When his forecast did not come true in December last year, he extended his <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> price prediction timeframe by six months to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/tim-draper-extends-btc-price-prediction-by-6-months-by-mid-2023-im-expecting-to-see-bitcoin-hit-250k/">mid-2023</a>. He <a href="https://observer.com/2022/12/tim-draper-bitcoin-prediction-ftx-crypto/">told</a> the Observer that if that still does not happen, then he is certain bitcoin will reach the $250,000 milestone before the end of 2024. He stated: &#x201C;I am almost 100 percent sure I will be right in 18 months.&#x201D; The venture capitalist also expects the price of bitcoin to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/venture-capitalist-tim-draper-explains-why-bitcoin-will-soar-past-his-250k-estimate/">soar past his estimate</a> due to adoption by women.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
According to his tweet on Friday, Draper now believes that it could take until the end of June 2025 for bitcoin to reach the $250,000 price point.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Draper also recently raised concerns regarding cryptocurrency regulation and criticized the enforcement approach taken by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;Regulation by enforcement is killing our economy. It is killing China too,&#x201D; he tweeted on June 20. During an <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6329302394112">interview</a> with Fox Business on June 12, he criticized the securities regulator and its chair, Gary Gensler, for taking an enforcement-focused approach to regulating the crypto industry, stating:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>I think we&#x2019;ve got a real problem because the SEC has been spreading fear and all of the innovators are leaving the country &#x2026; This regulation by enforcement makes no sense.</p></blockquote>

Just over $2 billion in stablecoins have been withdrawn from the stablecoin token economy since May 28.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Stablecoin Economy Faces Contraction as Market Capitalization Dips Below $129 Billion</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
The value of the <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com">crypto economy</a> has risen over the past 30 days; however, the stablecoin economy experienced a loss of over $2 billion in June. According to data, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230528085033/https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/stablecoins">on May 28</a>, the net value of the stablecoin economy was $130.28 billion, whereas it currently stands at $128.21 billion. This indicates that stablecoin redemptions amounted to $2.07 billion over the past 30 days.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
According to <a href="https://archive.ph/lUlbr">current statistics</a> archived on July 2, three out of the top five stablecoins by market valuation experienced redemptions. Tether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a>) and trueusd (TUSD) witnessed gains in the past 30 days, with <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a> increasing by a mere 0.1%. In contrast, TUSD surged by 49.4% compared to the previous month, resulting in its market cap expanding from $2 billion to the current $3.05 billion.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Among the top five stablecoins, USDC, DAI, and BUSD experienced redemptions. Usd coin (USDC) had 5.5% of its supply redeemed, DAI recorded a loss of 5.7%, and BUSD saw a reduction of 20.2% in its supply over the past month. The supply of USDC dropped to 27.32 billion, while DAI&#x2019;s supply decreased to 4.34 billion, and BUSD&#x2019;s supply was reduced to 4.13 billion.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The stablecoin economy has significantly contracted since last year, reaching its lowest value in approximately 21 months. Additionally, stablecoin trade volumes have declined. However, the sector of dollar-pegged tokens still represents a majority of the overall trading pairs in the crypto market. Out of the entire $26.80 billion in trade volume across the entire crypto economy, a total of $15.86 billion in trades involved stablecoin assets.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />

At the time of reporting, <a href="https://defillama.com/lsd">approximately 10.11 ETH is locked</a>, with a value of $19.456 billion using today&#x2019;s exchange rates. Lido, the top-ranking liquid staking derivatives protocol, claims a remarkable 74.51% market share as it holds roughly 7,530,330 ether as of Sunday morning at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time, according to <a href="https://defillama.com/lsd">defillama.com</a>.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Over the past week, Lido&#x2019;s total value locked (TVL) rose by 1.90%, while its monthly growth rate reached 7.57%. The defi application&#x2019;s current TVL stands at $14.43 billion. Meanwhile, Coinbase&#x2019;s Wrapped Ether defi platform witnessed a seven-day TVL increase of 3.27%, although it experienced a slight dip of 0.24% over the month. Currently, Coinbase&#x2019;s liquid staking derivatives platform secures around 1,124,130 ether worth $2.24 billion.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Rocket Pool, the third-largest liquid staking protocol, saw a modest seven-day growth of roughly 0.99%. However, its 30-day performance revealed a more substantial increase of 9.69%. On Sunday morning, Rocket Pool&#x2019;s holdings amounted to around 803,406 ether valued at $1.54 billion. In contrast, the Frax Ether defi application reported a 1.96% weekly rise and a monthly growth of only 0.81%, with control over 234,062 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>. Lastly, Stakewise, the fifth-largest liquid staking derivatives platform, observed a marginal 0.31% uptick over the past week and a June increase of 1.10%.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Among the 10.11 million staked ether, a total of 22 liquid staking derivatives platforms exist. The top five liquid staking derivatives tokens have an ETH-peg price discrepancy ranging between 0.08% and 0.53%, as recorded on Sunday morning. With Lido&#x2019;s impressive liquid staking cache, its token Lido staked ether (STETH) now ranks as the seventh largest market cap in the industry today.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />

Attorneys for Bittrex argue that the SEC cannot regulate cryptocurrency assets as securities without approval from Congress.</strong></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">SEC Lawsuit: Bittrex Seeks Dismissal, Citing Lack of Clarity in Token Securities Regulation</h2>
<p dir="ltr">In mid-April 2023, Bittrex&#8217;s U.S. crypto exchange <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-charges-crypto-exchange-bittrex-with-operating-unregistered-exchange-broker-and-clearing-agency/">faced a lawsuit</a> from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for allegedly operating an unregistered exchange, broker, and clearing agency. SEC Chair Gary Gensler stated that the securities watchdog was &#8220;holding Bittrex accountable for its noncompliance.&#8221; Two weeks later, Bittrex&#8217;s U.S.-based exchange <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-exchange-bittrex-enters-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection-following-sec-lawsuit/">filed</a> for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. In the most recent <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.321164/gov.uscourts.wawd.321164.40.0.pdf">court filing</a>, Bittrex&#8217;s legal team is seeking the dismissal of the SEC case against the company.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The attorneys argue that the regulation of tokens as securities in the U.S. remains a &#8220;major question&#8221; that lacks definition and remains unanswered. Bittrex also contends that the SEC failed to provide sufficient notice regarding the alleged violations of securities laws. The attorneys representing the crypto exchange criticized the securities regulators for conducting a six-year investigation without identifying a single unlawfully listed crypto asset token until mid-April 2023. “Yet the Commission is still missing essential elements of its claims,” noted Bittrex in its request for dismissal.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The complaint offers three reasons for seeking dismissal. First, it highlights the unresolved question of whether tokens should be subject to securities regulations, as asserted by the SEC. Attorneys emphasize that this issue requires the attention of congressional leaders rather than being solely determined by the SEC or the court. Second, Bittrex emphasizes that the complaint fails to provide substantial evidence supporting the claim that any of the secondary-market transactions conducted on Bittrex&#8217;s platform involved securities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lastly, the attorneys contend that the SEC&#8217;s inadequate definition of the alleged misconduct has deprived Bittrex of proper notification regarding the claims made against it. Bittrex&#8217;s attempt to seek dismissal aligns with <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-alleges-sec-lacks-any-powers-to-regulate-digital-asset-exchanges-in-recent-filing/">Coinbase&#8217;s 177-page argument</a>, which asserts that the SEC&#8217;s enforcement actions violate due process and the constitutional separation of powers. The Bittrex dismissal request shares a similar sentiment with Coinbase&#8217;s argument, as it firmly believes that the SEC lacks the &#8220;clear congressional authorization&#8221; necessary to apply securities laws to tokens under the major questions doctrine.</p>

<h2 class="sc-fXMkjo erYIft">What is De-Dollarization? Exploring the Shift Away From the US Dollar&#x2019;s Global Dominance</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
From the latter half of 2022 and continuing into 2023, the concept of de-dollarization has gained significant traction, making its mark on the mainstream media. This surge in attention can be attributed to the concerted efforts of BRICS countries such as Brazil, China, and Russia, who are endeavoring to diminish the dominance of the greenback. Although a prevailing sentiment suggests that the U.S. dollar&#x2019;s global reserve status is on the brink of dissolution, there are dissenting voices asserting that the hype surrounding de-dollarization has been exaggerated.&#13;<br />

However, as much as 59% believe scams are among the main barriers stopping many from dabbling with cryptos. Just under half of the respondents (48%) named the crypto market’s volatility as one of the most significant barriers to entry.</strong></p>
<h2>Respondents See Financial Trading as a Requisite Skill</h2>
<p>According to the findings of Consensys’ <a href="https://4795067.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/4795067/Reports/Consensys-Global-Report-on-Crypto-and-Web3-Summary-South-Africa.pdf?utm_campaign=Infura&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=263545422&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-888mwmgldnuMQAE4CxMJFlF0nqEkUnrv8o5mqFG4fXJkizCGrEMSLmIYKECIEBDFzFSQ-poqrNV_SwSBsUI_Yq4bIrFg&amp;utm_content=263545422&amp;utm_source=hs_automation">survey</a> on crypto and Web3, about 40% of South Africans are &#8220;familiar with the concept of Web3.&#8221; Overall, the survey found that &#8220;there are high levels of awareness of all Web3 concepts&#8221; among interviewed South Africans. Metaverse is the term that most of the respondents are familiar with and this is followed by non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and Web3.</p>
<p>However, when asked about the set of skills that one needs to participate in Web3, 43% of the respondents named financial trading as the most important prerequisite. Some 24% of the surveyed South Africans thought software engineering is the most important skill, while 17% identified marketing.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<h2>Scams Said to Be a Barrier to Adoption of Crypto</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, the survey findings also suggested that half of South Africa’s population believes the financial system could be improved. An even larger proportion of the respondents said the technology to improve the financial system already exists.</p>
<p>&#8220;80% Of the population of South Africa agrees that we currently have the technology required to transform or fully rebuild the financial system. Only 4% disagree with that,&#8221; the survey report said.</p>
<p>Concerning cryptocurrencies, the survey found that 98% of the respondents have heard about cryptocurrencies. However, as much as 59% believe scams are one of the biggest barriers stopping many from dabbling with cryptos. Just under half of the respondents (48%) named the crypto market’s volatility as a significant barrier, while 40% thought the financial technology backing cryptocurrencies is too complex and only for the tech-savvy. Just 13% of the respondents said the “technology is not innovative or different from what exists now.”</p>
<p>On the regulation of cryptocurrencies or the lack thereof, 46% of the respondents said these must be &#8220;heavily regulated to ensure that traditional financial markets are not destabilized and that investors are protected.&#8221; Only 7% felt regulators need to let the industry self-regulate.</p>

Buterin mentioned how projects like Solana were included in these legal actions and stated that the real competition was the &#x201C;centralized world.&#x201D;</strong></p>&#13;
<h2>Vitalik Buterin Opens up on SEC Crypto Enforcement Actions</h2>&#13;
<p>Vitalik Buterin, a co-founder of Ethereum, has opened up on his thoughts about the recent crypto enforcement actions the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is taking against exchanges and cryptocurrency projects. When asked about his thoughts on the issue by Matt Huang, co-founder of California-based crypto investment firm Paradigm, Buterin <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1674644137847451649?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">answered</a>:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">I feel bad that Solana </span>and other projects are getting hit in this way. They don&#x2019;t deserve it, and if ethereum ends up &#x2018;winning&#x2019; through all other blockchains getting kicked off exchanges, that&#x2019;s not an honorable way to win, and in the long term probably isn&#x2019;t even a victory.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>Furthermore, Buterin warned about the possible objectives behind these actions, stating that &#x201C;the real competition is not other chains, it&#x2019;s the rapidly expanding centralized world that is imposing itself on us as we speak,&#x201D; wishing other crypto projects a &#x201C;fair outcome&#x201D; on this situation.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<h2>Ethereum, Solana, and Their Classification</h2>&#13;
<p>Solana, Cardano, Polygon, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a>, and other cryptocurrency projects have been included in the current legal cases that the SEC is battling against <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-becomes-the-latest-target-of-sec-accused-of-unregistered-brokerage-and-securities-violations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-sec-identifies-12-crypto-tokens-as-securities-in-binance-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a>, two of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the market. SOL, the native token of Solana, a smart-contracts-enabled cryptocurrency project, has been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-sec-identifies-12-crypto-tokens-as-securities-in-binance-lawsuit/">labeled</a> a security in these processes, endangering its permanence and listing in U.S.-based exchanges without prior registration.</p>&#13;
<p>However, the Solana Foundation, whose mission is to &#x201C;help build the Solana protocol into the most censorship-resistant network in the world,&#x201D; has questioned the validity of the SEC&#x2019;s vision, <a href="https://twitter.com/SolanaFndn/status/1667578529612017666?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stating</a> it &#x201C;disagrees with the characterization of SOL as a security.&#x201D;</p>&#13;
<p>Ether, the native token of the Ethereum network, is also part of this security categorization debate. On a recent congressional hearing, SEC chairman Gary Gensler did not answer a direct <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ethers-security-status-remains-unclear-as-sec-chair-gensler-fails-to-answer-lawmakers-question/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">question</a> on whether ether represented a security in the eyes of the commission or not.</p>&#13;
<p>However, in his now infamous 2018 speech, former SEC official William Hinman <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speech-hinman-061418" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detailed</a> that based on his understanding, &#x201C;current offers and sales of ether are not securities transactions.&#x201D; On March 9, 2023, New York attorney general Letitia James filed a lawsuit against Kucoin, in which the prosecutor <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/new-york-attorney-general-files-lawsuit-against-kucoin-and-declares-ethereum-a-security/">classified</a> ether as a security.</p>&#13;
<p>According to JPMorgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, the unsealing of the Hinman docs, a group of internal memos and emails showing the discussions SEC officer had before this speech, boosts the possibility of ethereum being ruled a commodity, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-managing-director-nikolaos-panigirtzoglou-hinman-docs-are-a-boost-to-ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explaining</a> that these might trigger a boom for decentralization.</p>&#13;
