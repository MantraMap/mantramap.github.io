			  <description><![CDATA[<p>It has been a bullish month for Bitcoin (BTC) so far, with the cryptocurrency peaking at $31,486 before settling in the $30k range. But while Bitcoin (BTC) prepares for the next rally, it appears that Tradecurve &mdash; a new cryptocurrency trading platform &mdash; is leading the altcoin pump with 80% gains during the ongoing presale. Let's look at why these two assets are so bullish.</p>
<p></p>
Tradecurve: More Gains Ahead?
<p>Tradecurve is shaping up to be a comprehensive trading platform that offers a wide array of investment options &mdash; think stocks, commodities, currencies, and indices &mdash; all under one roof. The aim is to offer a one-stop-shop for users to manage their diverse investment portfolios, irrespective of where they are in the world.</p>
<p>The beauty of Tradecurve lies in its simplicity. Joining the platform is as easy as providing an email and linking your DeFi wallet. There's no need to go through the usual hoops of identity verification or other cumbersome onboarding procedures, making it a breath of fresh air in the otherwise intrusive investment landscape.</p>
<p>Beyond just trading, Tradecurve also offers an arsenal of advanced tools designed to amplify your trading experience and potential returns. They offer a subscription to an AI-powered trading tool, for instance, that automates trading strategies and offers in-depth analytics on all markets.</p>
<p>The TCRV token, the lifeblood of the Tradecurve platform, also unlocks a host of benefits. Holders can stake tokens to earn passive income, avail of VIP account benefits, get discounts on subscription fees, and more as Tradecurve continues to establish itself in the DeFi world.</p>
<p>At present, the TCRV token is available at a bargain price of $0.018 during the presale. Considering that experts predict the value of the token could skyrocket to $1.00 after its listing on leading exchanges later this year, this presale might just be a golden opportunity to jump on board the Tradecurve bandwagon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Bitcoin (BTC) To $40K?
<p>Tradecurve isn't the only digital asset in the spotlight &mdash; Bitcoin (BTC) is preparing for its next rally and could hit $40,000 in July. This prediction comes from noted crypto analysts who suggest that an influx of institutional investors could push Bitcoin (BTC) prices to fresh all-time highs.</p>
<p>This news was triggered by the news that Blackrock, the largest global asset manager in the world, recently filed an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) for Bitcoin (BTC). This significant move signals Wall Streets' increasing confidence in Bitcoin (BTC), marking a pivotal moment in the cryptocurrency sphere.</p>
<p>While this news should have long-term impacts, Bitcoin (BTC)'s price has already pushed from $28.4k to a peak of just above $31k within a week. Analysts are watching closely, speculating this news could herald the onset of a new bull market for Bitcoin (BTC).</p>
<p>You see, approval of the Bitcoin ETF could trigger a substantial flow of capital into the crypto market. ETFs present an opportunity for traditional and institutional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the need to personally buy, store, and manage the cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>However, they caution that for this upward trajectory to continue, Bitcoin (BTC) will first need to break through the $31-32k resistance level. The current price of $30,600 has the market bullish, with many anticipating a breakout and pump to the $36,000 - $40,000 range within days.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>With the crypto market's meteoric rise, more people are keen to explore cryptocurrencies beyond the typical Bitcoin investment. This burgeoning interest is further piqued by the myriad of projects that have sprung up, each promising unique value propositions and significant ROI. While the sheer volume of altcoins can be daunting to newcomers, this article will explore the seven best crypto to buy now not named Bitcoin. From altcoins specializing in fractionalized NFT investing, play-to-earn gaming rewards, and enhancing DeFi connectivity to revolutionizing rendering processes, these coins offer a diversified investment portfolio for beginners and experienced investors.</p>
Best Crypto To Buy Now Not Named Bitcoin
<p>Beyond Bitcoin, the crypto market brims with promising altcoins, each representing unique value propositions. Seven standout tokens include InQubeta, pioneering fractionalized NFT investing in AI startups; DigiToads, intertwining play-to-earn gaming with NFTs; Manifold Finance, augmenting DeFi connectivity; Ocean Protocol, democratizing data access; Trust Wallet Token, driving a popular wallet ecosystem; Render, revolutionizing rendering processes; and Litecoin, an enduring alternative to Bitcoin. These diverse tokens offer profitable investment opportunities for every investor's portfolio.</p>
InQubeta (QUBE) -&nbsp; Best Altcoin For Fractionalized NFT Investing
<p>A game-changing project in the cryptocurrency space, InQubeta has set its sights on changing how we invest in AI startups. With the QUBE token at its core, InQubeta offers an innovative and sophisticated platform for fractionalized investment in AI enterprises. Its groundbreaking approach allows even the smallest investors to have a stake in some of the most promising AI projects in the industry.</p>
<p>InQubeta leverages the power of Web3 to bring to life the world's first fractionalized AI NFT crowdfunding platform. The platform turns investment opportunities into Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), which can then be fractionalized and distributed to investors. This revolutionary approach to fundraising means that everyone can get a piece of the AI startup action, thereby democratizing investment and engaging a broader community of stakeholders.</p>
<p>The QUBE token is an integral part of the InQubeta ecosystem. It is a deflationary token, meaning its supply reduces over time due to a burning mechanism. Thus, 2% of QUBE token sales and 1% of purchases are burned, ensuring scarcity and helping to bolster the token's value over time. The token is vested over 12 weeks.</p>
<p>InQubeta has its own custom-built NFT marketplace, which allows AI startups to raise funds and offer reward and equity-based NFTs to their investors. By purchasing QUBE tokens, holders can directly invest in these promising projects, fostering a thriving ecosystem and generating potential returns, with experts anticipating the price of QUBE to rise more than 5x after the presale.</p>
<p></p>
DigiToads (TOADS) - Play-to-Earn (P2E) Gaming and Rewards
<p>DigiToads operates as a full utility meme coin with a unique play-to-earn (P2E) gaming aspect, setting it apart as one of the best cryptos for beginners looking to delve into the NFT space. The P2E model incorporates a fascinating web3 game where players can collect, nurture, and battle DigiToads, adding an interactive dimension to this cryptocurrency investment. These digital amphibians can be acquired through buying, trading, or winning, making TOADS tokens an integral part of the gaming ecosystem. These tokens purchase various items, including food, potions, and training equipment for the DigiToads, creating an engaging virtual environment for players.</p>
<p>This play-to-earn feature extends beyond mere gaming; it provides a pathway for players to earn TOADS tokens, one of the top crypto coins to buy today. The DigiToads game rewards the top 25% of players on the leaderboard with TOADS tokens, creating a competitive environment that incentivizes player performance. Furthermore, 50% of the funds obtained from in-game item sales are allocated to the prize fund for distribution among the top 25% of players. Therefore, the game design caters to a fun and competitive player experience and serves as an avenue for participants to earn cryptocurrency rewards.</p>
<p>Considering the high-growth potential of TOADS tokens, they are arguably one of the best cryptos to invest in now. The P2E model is up-and-coming for those wondering what crypto to invest in, as the DigiToads project offers a direct earning potential through gameplay. Moreover, the regular prize pool payouts to top performers in the game underscore the potential returns for skilled and dedicated players. As the popularity of P2E gaming continues to rise, DigiToads is positioned as a leading project in this innovative intersection of gaming and crypto investments. It is one of the most promising presales to buy now that can experience over 450% growth in the near future.</p>
<p></p>
&nbsp;Manifold Finance ($FOLD): Enhancing DeFi Connectivity
<p>The crypto world undeniably provides opportunities for beginners, especially those keen to dive into DeFi projects. Manifold Finance ($FOLD) is the best crypto for beginners. Born as a middleware product, $FOLD is designed to augment connectivity between DeFi protocols and safeguard users from MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) attacks&mdash;a high value feature for anyone venturing into crypto. The functionality to shield users from MEV attacks has been the first offering in the Manifold Finance product line. MEV refers to the profit potential by changing the order of transactions within a block. In this area, miners or validators enjoy the power to choose transactions for inclusion in blocks.</p>
<p>Selected as a promising cryptocurrency for beginners, $FOLD&mdash;through its product, OpenMEV&mdash;provides security against sandwich attacks, a common MEV attack. Sandwich attacks occur when a trader places transactions before and after a victim transaction, capturing the price difference. OpenMEV shields users from such exploitations, returning funds and fees to traders. Utilizing MEV opportunities, OpenMEV employs secure smart contract techniques to scale services like SushiSwap for end-users, an invaluable aspect for beginner cryptocurrency investors seeking the best crypto to invest in.</p>
Ocean Protocol (OCEAN) - Best Altcoin For Democratising Access to Data
<p>OCEAN, an ERC20 token, is undoubtedly a standout in the crypto space, aiming to democratize access to data. This initiative presents the potential to challenge tech giants such as Google and Facebook, making it one of the best cryptos to invest in now. Ocean Protocol enables data owners to sell their information through the Ocean Market app, providing consumers with previously inaccessible private data. This offers AI practitioners and data scientists advantages, granting access to more data, crypto-secured provenance, and income opportunities.</p>
<p>Fulfilling the top crypto to buy criteria, OCEAN's utilization in buying and selling data, governance, and staking makes it a hot contender. The Ocean Protocol was founded in 2017 by Bruce Pon and Trent McConaghy. It aims to democratize data, enhance AI capabilities, and spread the benefits of artificial intelligence. OCEAN has a capped max supply of 1.41 billion tokens. A portion was allocated for community projects and burning a fraction of network revenue&mdash;elements worth considering when deciding on the best cryptocurrency to buy today.</p>
Trust Wallet Token (TWT) - Top Cryptocurrency Wallet Ecosystem
<p>Trust Wallet Token (TWT) should be on the radar for those considering which crypto to buy. The TWT token is the official token of Trust Wallet, a mobile-based cryptocurrency wallet that boasts extensive support for over 250,000 distinct assets across 33 blockchains&mdash;an ideal choice for anyone looking to make the best crypto investments. The "Earn" feature in the Trust Wallet allows users to generate passive income simply by pressing a button. Accessibility is central to Trust Wallet's design, with no KYC verification or barriers to trading cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>TWT, a token based on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), is fast garnering attention, mainly due to the benefits it offers its holders. These include participating in governance activities, voting on crucial decisions for the Trust Wallet app, and receiving discounts for buying cryptocurrencies within the ecosystem&mdash;elements seriously worthy of consideration for those figuring out what crypto to invest in.</p>
Render (RNDR): Revolutionizing the Rendering Process
<p>Render, an innovative platform revolutionizing the rendering process, connects artists and GPU providers. This is achieved through the power of blockchain and cutting-edge technologies. The platform streamlines the creation of high-quality 3D graphics and animations. Artists can access powerful GPUs to render their works at affordable costs, using RNDR tokens to pay for the rendering services. This platform has applications across multiple sectors, including film, gaming, and architecture, making it an exciting prospect for those looking for the best coin to invest in.</p>
<p>The RNDR token, based on the Ethereum blockchain, is used as a medium of exchange on the Render network. For those asking, "What crypto should I buy?", RNDR offers an interesting proposition. This is due to its unique proposition, linking providers of GPU power with those who need it, combined with its potential to disrupt the rendering industry. By tokenizing GPU power, Render allows miners to monetize their idle resources, making RNDR one of the top 5 cryptocurrencies for individuals looking to invest in a transformative project.</p>
Litecoin (LTC): The Silver to Bitcoin's Gold
<p>Litecoin (LTC) has been prominent in cryptocurrency since its inception in 2011. The "silver to Bitcoin's gold" is what makes Litecoin one of the best digital currencies for boosting their portfolio. An open-source project based on the Bitcoin protocol, Litecoin features several significant improvements, such as a faster block generation time and a different hashing algorithm.</p>
<p>With its longevity in the crypto market and the backing of an active developer community, Litecoin continues to be an appealing option for investors. Buying LTC offers a robust entry point for those wondering how to get into cryptocurrency. It is widely available on most cryptocurrency exchanges, enjoys high liquidity, and can be used for various applications, including online shopping and forex trading. Given these features, Litecoin is undeniably one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy now.</p>
Best Crypto To Buy Now Not Named Bitcoin - Conclusion
<p>While Bitcoin remains a dominant force in the space, it's clear that the market is teeming with diverse and promising altcoins that offer unique value propositions. InQubeta, DigiToads, Manifold Finance, Ocean Protocol, Trust Wallet Token, Render, and Litecoin are just a few examples of cryptocurrencies that have carved a niche in this expansive universe.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Bulls Seek to Hold 29427:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 8 July 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) remained impacted by bearish technical sentiment early in the Asian session as the pair came off to the 29715.97 area after trading as high as the 31525.10 area, a recent twelve-month high reached a few trading sessions ago.&nbsp; &nbsp;Traders then lifted BTC/USD to the 30363.57 area, a move that represented a test of the 38.2% retracement of the recent depreciating range from 31525.10 to 29715.97.&nbsp; Decent selling pressure recently intensified around the 31142.38 area and this elevates the risk of another test of the 29427 area, representing the 38.2% retracement of the broader appreciating range from 26165.98 to 31443.67.&nbsp; &nbsp;Below that area, the 28604.83 level represents the 50% retracement of that appreciating range.&nbsp; Additional upside price objectives include the 31737, 32125, and 33569 areas.&nbsp; Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 31674, 32043, 34531, and 34658 areas.</p>
<p>Following recent selling pressure, areas of potential technical support and buying pressure include the 29427, 28886, 28804, 28182, 28096, and 27306 areas.&nbsp; &nbsp;Technicians are closely watching to see how much technical support develops around the 28095.44 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the historical depreciating range from 69000 to 15460.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and below the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>A recent report by JP Morgan looks to play down the effect that the approval of a Spot Bitcoin ETF might bring to the crypto sector.</p>
The hype caused by Blackrock
<p>Once it was announced that the biggest asset manager in the world (Blackrock) had filed for a Spot Bitcoin ETF, the whole crypto market was thrown into a frenzy of hope and optimism that this would be the spark that ignites the next crypto bull run.</p>
<p>There is no bigger player than Blackrock, and add to this the pro-crypto and bitcoin comments made by its CEO Larry Fink on national TV, and you have the perfect narrative to help the crypto market explode higher.</p>
Bitcoin spot ETF is anathema to banks
<p>Such a scenario is absolute anathema to the commercial banking system. Should institutions and the average retail investor get the message that bitcoin is worth investing in, and given the parlous state of the US dollar and all other fiat currencies, a trickle of crypto buying could become an avalanche.</p>
JP Morgan report attempts damage limitation
<p>The line taken by strategists in the JP Morgan report that was released on Thursday is that the Blackrock ETF &ldquo;is unlikely to be a game changer for crypto markets&rdquo;. One of the main arguments for this was that Spot Bitcoin ETFs already exist in Canada and Europe, yet have not gained a significant amount of investor interest.</p>
<p>Another avenue of reasoning that was explored by the report was that in the JP Morgan view, a Spot ETF had only &ldquo;marginal&rdquo; benefits over a Futures ETF. While some advantages of a Spot ETF were laid out, the only real &lsquo;disadvantage&rsquo; appeared to be that a Spot ETF could potentially take trading activity and liquidity away from the already existent Futures ETFs&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given that a Bitcoin Futures ETF is really more for institutional use than it is for retail investors, this surely can&rsquo;t be seen as an argument against the Spot ETF. In traditional finance both types of ETF exist and they are used as tools for different types of investor activity.</p>
Opinion
<p>Even as JP Morgan tries to influence markets against any activity that might promote interest or further buying into bitcoin products, they must surely be seeing the writing on the wall. CEO Jamie Dimon is still making his &ldquo;pet rock&rdquo; references to bitcoin, but as influential as he might be in financial circles, this kind of ridiculous name-calling is starting to become embarrassing for him.</p>
<p>JP Morgan is after all an institution that is there to make money, and staying out of such a potentially game-changing asset as bitcoin could be financial suicide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Granted there is probably a lot of pressure to follow this line by the Biden Administration, perhaps with promises of more tasty regional banks to be thrown at JP Morgan when they fail, to be gobbled up with relish, but how long can it stay out of what can become an alternative asset that can potentially be worth trillions?&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The latest statement from the Uniswap Foundation has claimed that the launch of version 4 of the protocol depends on Ethereum&rsquo;s upcoming Cancun upgrade.&nbsp;</p>
Cancun, Audit, Then V4
<p>The Uniswap Foundation recently put forth an announcement elaborating its plans for the much-awaited Uniswap v4 protocol. Although the foundation&rsquo;s Governance Lead, Erin Koen, has disclosed that the launch is scheduled for later this year, the fact is that a lot depends on the successful deployment of Ethereum&rsquo;s upcoming Cancun upgrade, which is scheduled to go live around the end of September.</p>
<p>Uniswap v4 will also require thorough auditing before it goes live, a process that can only start after Cancun and can take as long as one to four months.&nbsp;</p>
V4 To Reinvent Uniswap
<p>The v4 launch will bring forth a major reinvention for the Uniswap platform, which is already the largest decentralized exchange protocol. One of the most noteworthy changes that will be incorporated will be &ldquo;hooks&rdquo; or smart contracts that can enable additional customization of the protocol&rsquo;s liquidity pools to create a more modular exchange structure through features like dynamic fees, on-chain limit orders, and tailored on-chain oracles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another revolutionary feature that is to be incorporated with the v4 launch is a &ldquo;flash accounting&rdquo; system, which will reduce fees for liquidity providers and is being predicted to contribute significantly to gas savings. This mechanism leverages "transient storage," which will be activated by the proposed EIP-1153 change in Ethereum's protocol, set to be integrated during Cancun.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, in contrast to the v3 model, which involved transferring assets into and out of pools after each swap, the new method will only transfer net balances.</p>
Roadmap For V4
<p>For now, the next &ldquo;protocol code frozen&rdquo; stage will focus on incorporating the EIP-1153 into the protocol code for the next version. Ideally, the EIP-1153 will be successfully integrated into Etheruem&rsquo;s Cancun upgrade, which will allow the Uniswap Foundation to roll out the v4 protocol.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Koen has claimed that the foundation will not be rushing the process and instead take the necessary time to do due diligence and ensure the integrity of the Uniswap ecosystem and user safety. Therefore v4 launch will only go ahead after the necessary parameters are satisfied.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Ethereum community is eagerly anticipating the upcoming Cancun upgrade, fueling even more excitement for the potential advancements in the next version of Uniswap. This pivotal moment holds great significance for the DeFi space, as these developments have the potential to reshape the industry and reinvent decentralized exchanges.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin miners have raked in an impressive revenue of $184 million in the second quarter of 2023, breaking previous records.&nbsp;</p>
BRC-20 And Ordinals Boon For Miners
<p>The second quarter of 2023 has been particularly profitable for Bitcoin miners everywhere. It has brought with it a significant surge in profits, earning them a staggering total revenue of $184 million. Crypto analysts have attributed the million-dollar windfall to the popularity and rising demand for BRC-20 tokens and Ordinals. Coinmetrics pointed out that previously the fee market for Bitcoin miners used to be rather uneventful. However, the market has turned itself around and has raked in significant transaction fees for Bitcoin miners from April to June, with the latest transaction fee total being more than that of the five previous quarters combined.&nbsp;</p>
What Is Ordinals Protocol?&nbsp;
<p>The Ordinals protocol was launched in early 2023, and despite some pushback from the crypto community has enabled people to create NFT-like assets on Bitcoin by inscribing data to an individual &lsquo;satoshi.&rsquo; (1 satoshi = 1/100,000,000 BTC; and is the smallest unit a BTC can be broken down to).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its popularity got a boost when MicroStrategy co-founder and major Bitcoin proponent pointed out the protocol&rsquo;s role in raking in profits for BTC miners.&nbsp;</p>
Transaction Fee Surge Due To BRC-20
<p>The BRC-20 tokens were inspired by Etheruem&rsquo;s ERC-20 tokens and have blown up to reach over $240 million in market capitalization since its launch in March. To mint these tokens, users must submit a transaction accompanied by a fee. This transaction initiates the process of minting tokens on Bitcoin's network and ensures their inclusion in the subsequent block of transactions.</p>
<p>Soon after their launch, these tokens invoked a new surge of excitement in May, as more and more people chose to pay higher fees to expedite their transactions. This pushed up BTC&rsquo;s transaction fees in May, leading to speculation that the network was under attack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nick Hansen, CEO and co-founder of Luxor Technologies, said,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;BRC-20s introduced this urgency because what you needed to do was get your transactions confirmed faster than other peoples&rsquo; transactions. Then you would basically win the coins from the mint.&rdquo;</p>

Miners Continue To Profit
<p>Notably, the revenue earned by Bitcoin miners from transaction fees surpassed the block subsidy for the first time since 2017, indicating the substantial impact of these fees on miners' earnings.</p>
<p>However, the enthusiasm surrounding BRC-20 tokens has subsided, leading to a decline in payout amounts associated with transaction fees. Despite the diminished fervor, miners continue to receive substantial funds from transaction fees, especially when compared to previous years.</p>
<p>Hansen pointed out,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have calmed down, but we're still seeing persistent demand for Bitcoin block space. Miners are still making 10 to 15 times more from their transaction fee volume than they would have last year.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>At the BRICS summit on August 22, a new currency is to be announced which will be pegged to commodities, and gold in particular.</p>
<p>Central banks around the world bought almost 230 tons of gold in the first three months of this year, which is the most buying of gold in a single quarter that has ever been seen.</p>
Precious metals price suppression
<p>That the price of gold is still depressed perhaps bears testament to how the price of precious metals is being suppressed by the big commercial banks on the London Bullion Metals Exchange (LBMA) and the Commodities Exchange (COMEX).</p>
<p>However, as the alleged price suppression continues, large entities are able to buy gold and silver at rock-bottom prices in preparation for a world where tangible resources are much more likely to be valued than fiat currencies printed out of thin air.</p>
<p>The recent dumping of the gold and silver prices after huge shorting took place might be one of the western commercial banks&rsquo; last ditch attempts to keep both gold and silver from rocketing higher, which would have the potential to tear the heart out of the dollar.</p>
The BRICS nations
<p>The BRICS nations is the term for the original five countries that compose this trading block: China, Russia, India, Brazil, and South Africa. Saudi Arabia is among one of 25 other countries that are formally applying for membership of BRICS.</p>
<p>The BRICS nations hold and produce a significant share of the world&rsquo;s resources. China and Russia are the 6th and 7th biggest gold producers in the world, and Saudi Arabia and Russia are 2 of the 3 largest energy producers.</p>
<p>With China, India, Brazil, and Russia, BRICS has 4 of the 7 largest countries in the world measured by land mass, and also 4 of the 9 largest populations.</p>
<p>If 50% of the world&rsquo;s wheat production is also put into the mix it can be seen that the BRICS nations have a massive amount of power and should they put up a rival reserve currency to the dollar they will need to be taken extremely seriously.</p>
Creation of a new bond market
<p>Some analysts and detractors might say that a BRICS reserve currency cannot really get off the ground without a deep and liquid bond market to underpin it. Be that as it may, renowned economist Jim Rickards has posited that this could be done if BRICS+ created a bond market in around 20 countries at the same time.</p>
<p>With the massive population that the BRICS have, retail investors could be encouraged to buy the bonds, much like what happened with the Liberty Bonds, which were used in the US for the financing of the war in 1917.</p>
<p>If all this should come to pass then the financial upheaval and turmoil in the West, where currency is based on nothing, has the potential to completely change the world order. There is not much time left for retail investors to protect themselves with gold, silver, and bitcoin.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Crypto Exchange Bitfinex has announced that it has recovered some of the stolen assets from the 2016 Bitcoin hack but stated that a considerable number of assets are still yet to be recovered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The exchange stated in a press release that it had received the assets in question from the United States Department of Homeland Security.&nbsp;</p>
Tip Of The Iceberg&nbsp;
<p>According to the announcement, the exchange revealed that it had managed to recover $312,219 in cash and 6.9 in Bitcoin Cash (BCH) worth around $1951 at today&rsquo;s prices. The assets, stolen during the 2016 hack, were returned by the United States Department of Homeland Security. US authorities seized control of the funds in 2022 after arresting two individuals in connection with the Bitfinex hack. The exchange has been working with authorities to recover the assets stolen during the hack and return them to customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bitfinex stated in its blog post that the United States government was continuing to make progress in prosecuting the individuals involved with the breach. The United States Customs and Border Protection agency conducted the seizure of the recovered assets. This agency is the law enforcement agency of the US Department of Homeland Security. Paolo Ardoino, the Chief Technology Officer at Bitfinex, thanked the authorities, stating,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are extremely pleased to be able to reach another successful milestone in the recovery of assets stolen from Bitfinex in 2016. This specific seizure demonstrates the commitment of law enforcement officials to diligently track all the proceeds of the crime committed against Bitfinex almost seven years ago. We look forward to recovering as much of the stolen bitcoin as we possibly can and redistributing that to holders of the tokens that were issued in response to the hack in 2016.&rdquo;</p>
The Bitfinex Hack&nbsp;
<p>The Bitfinex hack was one of the biggest hacks to hit crypto at the time, with the hackers managing to steal around 119,756 Bitcoin (BTC) from the exchange thanks to a security breach. At the time, the stolen assets were worth around $71.8 million. However, at current prices, their valuation stands at a staggering $3.6 billion. On several occasions, the hackers had moved the stolen crypto around to launder the funds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, US authorities were tracking the assets and managed to arrest the hackers in 2022. The culprits, Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan were a married couple from New York. Both were subsequently charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering. The arrest also led to the seizure of most of the stolen funds, totaling around $3.6 billion worth of Bitcoin. Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco stated at the time,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s arrests, and the department&rsquo;s largest financial seizure ever, show that cryptocurrency is not a safe haven for criminals. In a futile effort to maintain digital anonymity, the defendants laundered stolen funds through a labyrinth of cryptocurrency transactions; thanks to the meticulous work of law enforcement, the department once again showed how it can and will follow the money, no matter what form it takes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bitfinex had issued a statement as well, expressing gratitude for the recovery, adding,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re pleased that the DOJ has recovered a significant portion of the bitcoin stolen during the 2016 hack. We have been cooperating extensively with DOJ since its investigation of this incident began.&rdquo;</p>

Redemption Of Stolen Assets&nbsp;
<p>Ardoino had stated that Bitfinex was looking forward to recovering as much of the stolen assets as possible and redistributing them to holders of the Recovery Right Tokens (RRt), which were issued after the hack. The tokens were intended to act as an IOU, and holders could exchange them for cash or iFinex capital stock at a later date. Currently, around 30 million RRT tokens are in circulation, which means that the amount recovered is insufficient to redeem all RRT tokens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under Bitfinex&rsquo;s contractual obligations, RRT token holders were to be redeemed at $1, after which up to 80% of any recovered assets were to be paid to SED, UNUS, and LEO token holders. According to Bitfinex, RRT token holders will have their tokens redeemed pro rata today, based on the size of their RRT holdings, on the 6th of July, 2023.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Multichain MPC bridge platform has seen abnormally large outflows, fueling concerns that the platform could be a target for a multi-million dollar exploit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the available information, over $130 million worth of crypto has been moved out from the bridge platform.&nbsp;</p>
Huge Outflows From Multichain&nbsp;
<p>The outflows first came to light on the 6th of July, when observers noticed that $102 million worth of crypto was withdrawn from the Multichain Fantom bridge on the Ethereum side. Additionally, $666,000 worth of Dogecoin and $5 million from Moonriver were also withdrawn. Additionally, 7214 Wrapped Ether (WETH) tokens worth $13.6 million, 1024 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) worth $31 million, and $58 million worth of the USDC stablecoin were withdrawn from the Fantom bridge&rsquo;s Ethereum smart contract. The total value of the cryptocurrency removed by the end of the day stood at over $100 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, the Dogecoin bridge&rsquo;s Ethereum contract saw a withdrawal of around $666,000, which accounts for over 86% of its total deposits. As a result, the bridge currently has only around $100,000 worth of assets remaining. Over $5.8 million worth of USDT and USDC were also withdrawn from the Multichain Moonriver contracts on Ethereum, with the Moonriver bridge contracts now having only around $700,000 remaining on them.&nbsp;</p>
Possible Exploit?&nbsp;
<p>Several on-chain investigators took to Twitter to warn the community that the event could be a possible exploit. Curve Finance was among the first to warn users that Multichain was, in all probability, hacked and that they should revoke all approvals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Multichain likely hacked. Exit all multichain assets. Good idea to revoke approvals to multichain bridge if you had any.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blockchain security firm PeckShield tagged Multichain in a Twitter post, highlighting the Phantom chain transactions and urging the team to take a closer look. Another commentator remarked that the entire fiasco looked like another massive hack, while On-chain investigator Spreek posted the Dogecoin transactions, urging the team to look at the transactions. However, Multichain did not respond to the tweets in question. Meanwhile, Fantom Foundation CEO Michael Kong stated that the Fantom team was looking into the issue.&nbsp;</p>
Multichain Finally Responds&nbsp;
<p>Multichain finally responded to users in a later tweet, stating that the movement of funds was indeed abnormal, and the team was &ldquo;unsure of what was happening and is currently investigating the issue.&rdquo; Multichain stated on Twitter,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The lockup assets on the Multichain MPC address have been moved to an unknown address abnormally. The team is not sure what happened and is currently investigating. It is recommended that all users suspend the use of Multichain services and revoke all contract approvals related to Multichain.&rdquo;</p>

Multichain&rsquo;s Growing Issues&nbsp;
<p>Multichain is a multi-party computation (MPC) bridging network, enabling users to bridge assets between chains. When a user wishes to bridge an asset, Multichain first confirms if the assets have been locked on the first chain. Once confirmed, the network mints the derivative assets on the second chain. When a user wishes to make a withdrawal, the process repeats itself, but in reverse. It will first confirm if the derivative assets have been destroyed on the second chain before releasing the locked assets back on the first chain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Multichain&rsquo;s team claims that the cryptographic keys controlling the entire process are split into shards and then distributed throughout the network. This should, theoretically, prevent any entity from making unauthorized withdrawals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, Multichain has been in the news for all the wrong reasons after suffering unspecified technical problems over the past few weeks. The team announced on the 31st of May that the CEO had gone missing, with the network suffering a multitude of problems due to unforeseeable circumstances, leading to significant transaction delays. Binance also announced that it was halting the withdrawal of some Multichain derivative tokens due to network issues on Multichain.</p>

Over $5.8 million worth of USDT and USDC were also withdrawn from the Multichain Moonriver contracts on Ethereum, with the Moonriver bridge contracts now having only around $700,000 remaining on them.&nbsp;</p>
Possible Exploit?&nbsp;
<p>Several on-chain investigators took to Twitter to warn the community that the event could be a possible exploit. Curve Finance was among the first to warn users that Multichain was, in all probability, hacked and that they should revoke all approvals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Multichain likely hacked. Exit all multichain assets. Good idea to revoke approvals to multichain bridge if you had any.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blockchain security firm PeckShield tagged Multichain in a Twitter post, highlighting the Phantom chain transactions and urging the team to take a closer look. Another commentator remarked that the entire fiasco looked like another massive hack, while On-chain investigator Spreek posted the Dogecoin transactions, urging the team to look at the transactions. However, Multichain did not respond to the tweets in question. Meanwhile, Fantom Foundation CEO Michael Kong stated that the Fantom team was looking into the issue.&nbsp;</p>
Multichain Finally Responds&nbsp;
<p>Multichain finally responded to users in a later tweet, stating that the movement of funds was indeed abnormal, and the team was &ldquo;unsure of what was happening and is currently investigating the issue.&rdquo; Multichain stated on Twitter,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The lockup assets on the Multichain MPC address have been moved to an unknown address abnormally. The team is not sure what happened and is currently investigating. It is recommended that all users suspend the use of Multichain services and revoke all contract approvals related to Multichain.&rdquo;</p>

Multichain&rsquo;s Growing Issues&nbsp;
<p>Multichain is a multi-party computation (MPC) bridging network, enabling users to bridge assets between chains. When a user wishes to bridge an asset, Multichain first confirms if the assets have been locked on the first chain. Once confirmed, the network mints the derivative assets on the second chain. When a user wishes to make a withdrawal, the process repeats itself, but in reverse. It will first confirm if the derivative assets have been destroyed on the second chain before releasing the locked assets back on the first chain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Multichain&rsquo;s team claims that the cryptographic keys controlling the entire process are split into shards and then distributed throughout the network. This should, theoretically, prevent any entity from making unauthorized withdrawals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, Multichain has been in the news for all the wrong reasons after suffering unspecified technical problems over the past few weeks. The team announced on the 31st of May that the CEO had gone missing, with the network suffering a multitude of problems due to unforeseeable circumstances, leading to significant transaction delays. Binance also announced that it was halting the withdrawal of some Multichain derivative tokens due to network issues on Multichain.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Memecoins had a heavy rally in the past few weeks, and it felt like the 2021 bull season again. But the excitement was short-lived, as most new memecoins that emerged in that timeframe have gone back to oblivion, but there&rsquo;s Pepe (PEPE) with some exciting narratives working in its favor. While the memecoin hype dies down, Uwerx also has taken center stage in the market with impressive presale rounds. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Read on to learn the potential it has to grow massive and how you can take advantage of the presale for profit:</p>
Pepe (PEPE) Hype Train is Down
<p>Pepe (PEPE) is impressive as a new memecoin considering the rallying strength it exhibited in just some weeks after emerging. PEPE moved to become a $1.8 billion market cap project in just two weeks, but the hype train is dying. There&rsquo;s only so much a project can do in a bear market, and PEPE holders can now wait for the bull market to launch another full-blown rally.</p>
<p>The Pepe (PEPE) community is growing, and in the past few weeks, the memecoin craze has been shipped to other blockchain networks, including Bitcoin (BTC), which is fairly new to memecoins. Pepe as a meme had existed way before it got a derived cryptocurrency, but now crypto enthusiasts are confident that it can flip Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) to become the biggest memecoin in the market.</p>
<p>Pepe (PEPE) has fallen to around $600 million market cap, and with the prospects of passing Dogecoin ($10 million market cap) and Shiba Inu ($5 billion market cap), that&rsquo;s some 10x - 20x potential to look forward to. We could see such happen in a bull market considering Shiba Inu(SHIB) once pulled it off against Dogecoin (DOGE).</p>
<p>However, memecoins always remain a risky play, and if you want to get a crypto asset with less risk, then you should be learning more about Uwerx.</p>
Uwerx (WERX) Gaining Momentum on Presale
<p>Uwerx is a decentralized freelance platform looking to help democratize the freelance economy and create more value for active participants, including freelancers, clients, and other businesses worldwide that find the global gig market valuable. A report from Forbes has shown top companies like Google, Meta, and Unilever were able to create workforce synergy between full-time employees and freelancers, and the results were impressive. </p>
<p>With this level of attention coming to the gig market, Uwerx might just be the most valuable solution the landscape has seen. For a start, Uwerx charges only 1% on contracts established on the platform. Uwerx also enables a host of blockchain-enabled features like incentivization, community governance, transparent pricing, personalized matching, and some special collaboration tools.</p>
<p>Uwerx is a Web3 platform but will be as intuitive as any existing freelance platform. WERX will be the native token of the platform and will power utility and governance. WERX is selling for cheap on presale at $0.047725, and this opportunity only lasts for a short while.</p>
<p>This week, a presale is launching a fully interactive prototype, which will include registration pages for freelancers and clients. Moreover, the much-anticipated feature, the Uwerx Vault, is set to be revealed next week. To decide the date for the test airdrop, a poll will be carried out.</p>
<p>Take the opportunity to join the WERX presale with the links below and enjoy a 15% bonus on your purchase.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Gemini Dollar and Tether are two of the world's most popular stablecoins. Both have gained traction during the recent banking crisis, in which several high-profile banks collapsed. However, their reliance on the U.S. dollar could potentially cause issues in the future. If inflation continues to rise throughout financial markets, both Gemini Dollar and Tether could struggle in the DeFi space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the same time, new projects like Tradecurve are making waves in the DeFi space. Tradecurve has raised $3 million during its presale, and following an 80% surge in value, analysts now believe that an additional 40% price rise could be on the table.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
Tether Makes A Huge Investment In Bitcoin Mining&nbsp;
<p>As the world's number one most traded cryptocurrency, Tether is considered an extremely safe crypto investment. The project recently invested $1 billion into a new Bitcoin mining farm in El Salvador.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This investment is designed to help create an eco-friendly mining solution, with Tether offering expertise in green energy alternatives. This particular farm will utilize Volcano energy to produce 241 MW of power and will also install photovoltaic cells to produce solar energy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This investment is a huge development in the Tether ecosystem, and has helped to solidify the project's reputation. As Tether continues to invest in DeFi, its popularity is only going to grow, which has made Tether the number one option for investors looking to buy stablecoins,&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
Gemini Dollar Trading Volume Surges&nbsp;
<p>Gemini Dollar is an alternative to Tether with a number of benefits. It&rsquo;s been approved by the New York Department of Financial Services, which makes it a safe investment despite the recent SEC lawsuits. Furthermore, Gemini Dollar has been audited by Trail of Bits Inc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gemini Dollar is also a stable investment due to being pegged to the U.S. Dollar. As of July 2023, Gemini Dollar has a daily trading volume of $1.8 million, a significant increase from June. This increase suggests that more investors are looking for stable investments, with Gemini Dollar becoming a top option in the process.&nbsp;</p>
Tradecurve Attracts Thousands Of New Investors&nbsp;
<p>Although Tradecurve may not be as stable as Gemini Dollar or Tether, the project offers significantly higher returns. Since its presale started, Tradecurve has raised over $3 million and offered investors returns of 80%. This ROI is expected to increase again soon, with stage four of the Tradecurve (TCRV) presale already 60% sold out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tradecurve offers an exciting new alternative to traditional investing. Its hybrid exchange lets investors buy the widest range of assets of any platform, including traditional and DeFi options. Assets such as commodities, forex, and CFDs can be traded by investors who can use cryptocurrency as collateral.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, as a decentralized platform, all of these assets can be traded anonymously. Tradecurve lets investors trade assets without needing to pass KYC or intrusive background checks. This is expected to be a big selling point for the project, as thousands of investors left centralized platforms following lawsuits from the SEC in June.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
Tradecurve Is Predicted To 100x Post Presale
<p>Tradecurve is now ranked among the fastest-growing cryptocurrencies in the DeFi market. Its value has continuously increased in June, and now experts believe its value could 50x before its presale ends. Post presale, price predictions are going as high as 100x once TCRV tokens are listed on major exchanges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With such high price predictions, Tradecurve&rsquo;s current price of $0.018 is believed to be a huge bargain, though, with hundreds of investors buying tokens daily, TCRV is expected to increase in value again before mid-July.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) attempted to retain recent strong advances early in the Asian session as the pair was lifted to the 31525.10 area, a fresh twelve-month high, after Stops were elected above the 31443.67 area that had represented a recently-established yearly high.&nbsp; Buying pressure emerged around the 30328.79 area and follow-on technical activity around the 30439.66 and 30575.66 areas accelerated the move.&nbsp; &nbsp;During a volatile pullback, buying pressure initially emerged around the 31828 level, a move lower to test the 38.2% retracement of the recent appreciating range from 30189.56 to 31525.10.&nbsp; Stops were eventually elected below the 31014, 30857, and 30699 areas during the eventual profit-taking depreciation, and additional downside retracement levels include the 30504 and 30475 areas.</p>
<p>Above the market, additional upside price objectives include the 31737, 32125, and 33569 areas.&nbsp; Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 31674, 32043, 34531, and 34658 areas.&nbsp; Following recent activity, areas of potential technical support and buying pressure include the 29863, 29427, 28886, 28804, 28182, 28096, and 27306 areas.&nbsp; &nbsp;Technicians are closely watching to see how much technical support develops around the 28095.44 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the historical depreciating range from 69000 to 15460.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Israeli foreign residents may soon benefit from a tax exemption on the sale of digital currencies. </p>
<p>A new bill that would afford certain tax benefits to Israel&rsquo;s crypto sector has passed a preliminary reading in the Knesset, the country&rsquo;s parliament.</p>
<p>A proposed bill that would exempt foreign residents from capital gains tax on the sale of digital assets and reduce tax on crypto options from 50% to about 25% passed its preliminary reading on Wednesday.</p>
Israel Vies to Attract Investment
<p>The bill, sponsored by Knesset member Dan Illouz, has the full support of Israel&rsquo;s coalition government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Illouz explained the bill is part of a larger economic strategy to attract investors and companies to the country.</p>
<p>The bill&rsquo;s explanatory note details:</p>

<p>Despite the growth potential of Israeli companies in the field, the regulatory reality in Israel is not adapted to the digital currency industry. Therefore, it is proposed to make a number of legislative amendments that will reduce the regulatory gap.</p>

<p>If passed, the bill would grant tax benefits similar to those afforded to high-tech firms to Israel&rsquo;s crypto sector. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr Illouz said in a press statement:</p>

<p>Up until now, workers in the crypto industry had to pay double the tax on their options compared to workers in the traditional high-tech industry. Moreover, foreign investors in the blockchain industry were not entitled to the same benefits as those entitled to investors in the traditional high-tech industry.</p>

<p>Adding,</p>

<p>This law amendment aims to balance the situation and eliminate the discrimination in taxation.</p>

<p>The bill further proposes that &ldquo;digital currency&rdquo; be used separately from &ldquo;security.&rdquo;</p>
Move Signals That Israel is Embracing Crypto
<p>The country&rsquo;s decision to equal taxation for crypto investors is a clear sign of actively embracing the industry.</p>
<p>Israel has been working toward integrating crypto into its economy. The country&rsquo;s central bank, the Bank of Israel, issued principles for regulating stablecoin activity in February.</p>
<p>The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange also revealed the Israeli government would conduct testing of a blockchain-based platform for issuing digital bonds. The project, dubbed &ldquo;Eden&rdquo;, aims to reduce costs and optimise the procedure of national bond issuance.</p>
<p>Israel&rsquo;s largest bank, Bank Leumi, also stated it would become the first Israeli bank to enable crypto trading, following a partnership with Paxos. The bank&rsquo;s digital platform, Pepper Invest, said that collaborating with Paxos would allow its customers to buy, hold, and sell cryptocurrencies.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Blur founder, Pacman, defends his NFT marketplace against accusations that the platform&rsquo;s strategies crashed the NFT market.&nbsp;</p>
Are NFTs In Trouble Because Of Blur?&nbsp;
<p>NFT marketplace Blur faces a public backlash over the falling NFT prices as investors and traders point fingers at its incentivized trading model. The upstart marketplace surpassed OpenSea as the leading Ethereum NFT trading platform by volume in February but now faces scrutiny.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the NFT market faces turbulent times, questions about the long-term sustainability of incentivized trading models are being raised. Bored Ape Yacht Club prices hit a two-year low, and other notable projects have also seen sizable price declines. Traders and investors are reevaluating the underlying value of NFTs and whether the current market downturn is a natural correction or a symptom of larger systemic issues.</p>
Blur&rsquo;s Controversial Stance On NFTs
<p>Blur's stance that NFTs are not unique assets but rather "altcoins with pictures," as controversially tweeted by crypto influencer Cobie last year, has reinforced this sentiment.</p>
<p>Blur made its debut as a marketplace in October, positioning itself as the platform for professional NFT traders. The promise of a token airdrop enticed users to choose Blur over competitors like OpenSea. When the BLUR token was finally launched in February, Blur quickly overtook OpenSea, becoming the top marketplace in terms of trading volume.</p>
A Short-Lived Success For Blur
<p>Traders began rapidly flipping NFTs to earn rewards, treating assets like Bored Apes and Otherside land plots as if they were fungible tokens. The surge in trading volume on Blur propelled the market-wide tally above $2 billion in February. As a result, some firms, like data platform CryptoSlam, denounced it as "wash trading,&rdquo; and the initial craze for the Blur marketplace died down pretty soon.</p>
<p>In recent months, overall market trading has sharply declined, resulting in whale traders, who initially benefited from exploiting the rewards model, now suffering losses and withdrawing funds from Blur's NFT bidding pool.&nbsp;</p>
Founder Pacman Responds
<p>Blur founder Tieshun Roquerre, who is more popularly known as Pacman, responded to the allegations against Blur, saying,</p>

<p>&ldquo;We launched in October 22. Since then, some floor prices have gone up, some floor prices have gone down. One of the few times floor prices went up in concert was when we injected liquidity into nfts via our airdrop. One of the few times floor prices went down in concert was when $40m of liquidity was removed via the Azuki mint (not throwing stones, the market just moves based on liquidity more than anything else).&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Binance no longer supports deposits and withdrawals for several cross-chain bridge tokens linked with the Multichain project.&nbsp;</p>
Binance Suspends Multichain Support
<p>In a recent development, Binance, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has announced that it is ending support for withdrawal and deposit for several Multichain-bridged tokens. From July 7 onwards, customers on networks like BNB Smart Chain, Fantom, Ethereum, and Avalanche will be unable to deposit or withdraw bridged tokens until further notice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is important to note that the suspension only applies to specific tokens bridged to Multichain and does not affect the trading of other cryptocurrencies on Binance. Users can still trade and engage in transactions with the wide range of tokens available on the exchange.</p>
<p>Some of the tokens affected by this decision are Polkastarter (POLS), Alchemy Pay (ACH), Beefy.Finance (BIFI), Harvest Finance (FARM), tokens minted through the bridge on Fantom, like Beefy.Finance (BIFI) and Alpaca Finance (ALPACA), and a token minted on Ethereum&rsquo;s bridge, Travala (AVA).</p>
Binance Assures Funds Safety
<p>Multichain is a cross-chain interoperability protocol. It enables the seamless transfer of assets between different blockchain networks and currently oversees over $1.3 billion in assets, with $698 million minted on Ethereum, $339 million minted on BNB Smart Chain, and $92 million on Fantom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, Binance is taking no chances when it comes to safeguarding user funds. Although the team has assured customers that funds remain secure, the uncertainty around the matter is worrying users whose funds are stuck in the protocol.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to a Binance spokesperson, the temporary suspension of these services on the Binance platform is only a temporary risk management measure. Users can still trade the tokens on Binance and withdraw them using alternative networks. This means that as long as the assets do not involve the Multichain project, they can proceed as normal.&nbsp;</p>
The Multichain Complication
<p>Although the team has not specified the exact reason behind this decision, it is implied that it is in response to the protocol&rsquo;s difficulties that occurred in May. During that period, the project experienced transactional difficulties with processing bridge transfers. Kava, zkSync, Polygon zkEVM, and several other pathways of the cross-chain bridge were not functioning properly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Multichain CEO Zhaojun was also unreachable and rumored to be taken into police custody. As a result, Binance suspended deposits for Multichain-bridged tokens on May 25, citing complications within the protocol. The recent suspension is just a follow-up to the previous action against Multichain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In conclusion, Binance's decision to suspend transfers of several tokens tied to Multichain is a proactive measure to ensure the security and stability of its users' funds. Users are advised to stay informed through official channels and await further updates from the exchange.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Perhaps on the back of incredibly bullish statements by Blackrock CEO Larry Fink, Bitcoin has set a new yearly high with expectations that it will go much higher.</p>
Bitcoin bull market is building
<p>The crypto bull market looks to be very much on this morning as bitcoin touches $31,500, a new high for this year. All that is needed is for bitcoin to get above this level and stay there for a few days in order to give the signal that the break is confirmed and that bitcoin can start traversing higher.</p>
<p>This new bullish environment may have been caused in part by the CEO of Blackrock, the biggest AUM company on the planet, saying on national TV yesterday that bitcoin was "digitising gold", and that it was an &ldquo;international asset&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is also after Blackrock had filed for a Spot Bitcoin ETF along with some other large institutional entities. With Blackrock&rsquo;s experience and fantastic success in getting the regulators to sign off on their many ETF filings, this one extra filing has the hallmarks of being an extremely good bet.</p>
<p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s current good fortune is also shared with some of the cryptocurrency market. If bitcoin rides high then most of the crypto market will follow suit, at least as long as impending regulation will allow.</p>
Solana
<p>One of those high riders today is Solana. Itself a target of the SEC, which has labelled it a security. This lightning fast layer 1 has been beaten to a pulp, falling from its November 2021 high of $260 to as low as $8 in December of last year.</p>
<p>However, at $8 it could be imagined that the bottom was in for Solana, with a wick down to $12.60 possibly signalling a double bottom. A descending trendline has suppressed the price since July of 2022 and therefore the $SOL break of this line today could herald much greater things as long as the break is confirmed.</p>
Stacks
<p>Stacks (STX) is another cryptocurrency to watch. It happens to be one of the only SEC-approved cryptocurrencies. It should certainly also benefit from the bitcoin narrative given that it's one of the very few bitcoin layer 2s, which enable apps to be built on top of bitcoin. It hit the 0.786 Fibonacci level yesterday and looks primed to go higher from here.</p>
