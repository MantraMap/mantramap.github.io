<li>The executive, who has formed a five-person team to work on issues related to the bankrupt exchange, explained that rates could change once there is new data about the balance sheet of FTX.</li>
<li>Femenia estimated that FTX owes between $10 billion and $13 billion to creditors. He outlined that between 5% and 10% of that amount needs to be paid to attorneys and relevant administrators so they can process the clients&#8217; cases.</li>
<li>The executive reminded that victims of the multi-billion Madoff Ponzi scheme recovered over $14 billion but paid over $1.5 billion for administration fees (around 10% of the total sum).</li>
<li>Described by US prosecutors as &#8220;one of the biggest financial frauds in American history,&#8221; FTX caused a significant market decline and left numerous investors empty-handed.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[There are currently almost 40,000 bitcoin ATMs, as over 86% are located in the USA.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The number of bitcoin automated teller machines (ATMs) has surged in accordance with the development of the cryptocurrency industry. The first such machine saw the light of day in October 2013. Needless to say, the industry has expanded by leaps and bounds since then, propelling massive interest and, in turn, more ATMs. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Currently, there are 39,678 such devices spread across 84 countries, with over 85% located in the United States of America.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">An Overlook of the Map</span></h2>
<p><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://coinatmradar.com/countries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to the latest data, bitcoin ATMs are predominantly situated in North America. The world&#8217;s leading economy &#8211; the USA &#8211; is home to 34,298 of them, as their number is the highest in the country&#8217;s financial hubs &#8211; New York, Los Angeles, and Miami. The northern neighbor &#8211; Canada &#8211; ranks second with 2,704 ATMs. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The next to complete the top 5 are Spain (270), Poland (214), and El Salvador (212). It comes without surprise that the small Central American nation found its place among the leaders since it </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/three-months-later-bitcoin-now-officially-a-legal-tender-in-el-salvador/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">became</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the first country to make bitcoin legal tender. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It is worth observing the situation in Asia. The highest density of BTC ATMs is in the special administrative region of China &#8211; Hong Kong &#8211; where one could find 154 machines. For its part, Japan had zero devices on its territory for more than four years.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The domestic authorities shut all crypto ATMs at the beginning of 2018 when hackers attacked the digital asset platform Coincheck. In August this year, though, they softened their stance and </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/four-years-later-crypto-atms-back-in-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">allowed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the installation of a few devices in Tokyo and Osaka.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Interestingly, Singapore, which aims to become a cryptocurrency hub, has no bitcoin ATMs. The nation&#8217;s top financial regulator &#8211; the MAS &#8211; </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://fortune.com/2022/01/19/singapore-cryptocurrency-regulation-bitcoin-atm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">banned</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the cash-to-crypto terminals as part of a broader crackdown on promoting digital currencies to the public at the beginning of the year.</span></p>
<p><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://ccaf.io/cbeci/mining_map" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Kazakhstan</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> &#8211; the country that accounts for over 13% of the global mining hashrate &#8211; has only one BTC ATM, while </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/vietnam-reaffirms-global-leadership-in-crypto-adoption-chainalysis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Vietnam</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, the world&#8217;s crypto adoption leader, has five devices.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It goes without saying that </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/trading-and-mining-crackdown-in-china-escalates-bitcoin-plunges-3k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">China</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> (where all cryptocurrency activities are forbidden) has zero machines.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Advancement Throughout the Years</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The first bitcoin ATM was </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/av/technology-24756030" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">installed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> on October 29, 2013, in a coffee shop in Vancouver, Canada. The second device saw the light of day on October 8, 2013, in Bratislava, Slovakia, while the USA had to wait until February 18, 2014, to have its first such machine (deployed in a cigar bar in Albuquerque, New Mexico).</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The number of devices slowly </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://coinatmradar.com/blog/bitcoin-atm-year-2015-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">grew</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to over 500 by the end of 2015, while in December 2017, they reached almost 2,000 worldwide.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The 2018 bear market ceased the rapid expansion of bitcoin ATMs, but their number started rising again in the following years. By the end of 2020, there were more than 12,600 crypto-automated teller machines worldwide.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Last year, when most digital currencies hit all-time high prices, crypto ATMs popped off. Over 20,000 of them were deployed in various countries, including struggling economies like Cambodia, Namibia, Venezuela, Lebanon, and more.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The prolonged crypto winter that has reigned for the bigger part of 2022 has slowed down the temps. As <em>CryptoPotato </em></span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/bear-market-effects-installation-of-new-crypto-atms-slows-down/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reported</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, the first eleven months of the year have seen the installation of 6,100 new crypto ATMs or nearly three times less than what popped up during 2021.</span></p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PR &#8211; Singapore, Singapore, 16th December, 2022, Chainwire]</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://serenityshield.io/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Serenity Shield</a>, a decentralized application platform that offers an innovative, revolutionary approach to crypto inheritance and secure storage solutions for sensitive data, is pleased to announce the signing of an extended partnership with the technology group <a href="https://archethic.net/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Archethic</a>.</p>
<p>As part of the partnership, Serenity Shield will integrate their product, the StrongBox®, into Archethic&#8217;s public blockchain and utilize their interoperable Decentralized Identity (DID) management solution to provide an additional layer of security to end-users.</p>
<p>The addition of Archethic blockchain will offer considerable value to Serenity Shield’s existing solution due to its speed, scalability, extreme security, environmental friendliness, and focus on decentralization. Moreover, this collaboration helps strengthen Serenity Shield’s cross-chain and interoperability aspirations and capabilities.</p>
<p>Moreover, embedding Archethic&#8217;s DID technology within the StrongBox® is a logical progression in the development of Serenity Shield and a step forward in its desire to offer an entirely decentralized and self-sovereign solution to its customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are thrilled to go deeper and extend our partnership with Archethic,&#8221; said Rodolphe Seynat, Co-Founder of Serenity Shield. &#8220;Archethic&#8217;s mission and values are aligned with those of Serenity Shield around digital and human rights: we mutually defend the idea that identity is not just about ownership, but about control and freedom. We look forward to working with them.&#8221;</p>
<h2>About Serenity Shield</h2>
<p>Serenity Shield was established in 2021 as a result of identifying a glaring and, as yet, unaddressed need in the global cryptocurrency market for the provision of secure access to and transfer of ownership of digital wallets. Leveraging advances in cryptography and private blockchain technology, it has designed a secure, non-custodial method to store and retrieve sensitive data for individuals but also corporates and institutions.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Scott Minerd &#8211; CIO and Chairman of Guggenheim Partners &#8211; believes the demise of crypto exchange FTX will cause more problems for companies and investors.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He reiterated his stance that market crashes could be beneficial for the industry because they could eliminate meaningless projects.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Buckle up for More Trouble</span></h2>

<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;There&#8217;s another shoe to drop &#8211; I can&#8217;t tell you where it is. The reason is this is just like any number of periods where we had easy money and a lot of speculation; the weakest players fall first. Crypto was obviously something that is crazy.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Minerd went on to predict that the crypto industry will survive the current turmoil, describing the situation to the Dot-Com bubble in the late 1990s:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;There is going to be wash out just like the Internet bubble.

			            <description><![CDATA[Hit by a sharp fall in trading volume, Indian crypto industry reps have been pressing the government to reduce the tax. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A junior finance minister told the Indian parliament on Tuesday that the government has collected about $7.4 million in TDS on crypto transfers since July 1. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Given the low numbers, the government may consider the local crypto industry’s demand to reduce the tax to a reasonable level – in the range of 0.01% to 0.05%.</span></p>
<h2>Low TDS Collection</h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In a written reply in the upper house of the Indian Parliament, Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary informed that the Indian government collected Rs 60.46 crore (Approx. $7.4 million) as TDS on crypto transactions since July 1, 2022, media <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/govt-receives-rs-60-46-crore-tax-from-tds-on-virtual-digital-assets-122121300699_1.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">reports</a> said.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He also informed that the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) conducts an awareness program for taxpayers and deductors. Additionally, it undertakes surveys, inquiries, and search and seizure operations to enforce the tax law on the crypto sector, he added.   </span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A Case for Tax Relief</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Right now, the Indian Finance Ministry and its agencies, including CBDT, are engaged in pre-budget consultations. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bharat Web3 Association (BWA) which counts Coinbase, CoinDCX, WazirX, Coinswitch Kuber, Polygon, and other major players in Indian cryptocurrency and blockchain sectors as members, has <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/indian-crypto-association-seeks-relief-from-high-taxes/" data-wpel-link="internal">raised</a> the issue of the high rate of TDS with the Finance Ministry. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Given the low TDS collection that indicates low trading volume, the Indian government might reconsider the 1% crypto tax as TDS and might provide some relief.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">1% TDS Hit Volume by 90%</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The 1% crypto transaction tax that became effective on July 1, 2022, dealt a blow to Indian crypto trade. It is levied on each trade valued above Rs. 10,000 ($250). </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">On an intraday trade, for example, a trader may end up doing multiple of these and get a substantial amount of capital locked in TDS, which can be claimed at the end of the financial year as the Income Tax Return (ITR). </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Indian crypto exchanges saw over 50% <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/indian-exchanges-volumes-slump-further-following-recent-crypto-tax/" data-wpel-link="internal">drop</a> in volume within a few days of the 1% transaction tax coming into effect and nearly 90% by the end of the month. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As the total TDS collection from crypto transactions is extremely low, it lends weight to the crypto industry’s <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/indian-crypto-industry-reps-call-for-reduction-in-certain-taxation-rules/" data-wpel-link="internal">demand</a> to bring it down to 0.01% &#8211; 0.05%. </span></p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The overall Bitcoin price action is on an impulsive decline after experiencing a significant rejection from a long-lasting resistance level at $18k. Failing the support level at $15k, the bulls could be in for a lot of trouble soon.</p>
<h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>By: Edris</strong></p>
<h3>The Daily Chart:</h3>
<p>Looking at the daily chart, the price oscillates in the large falling wedge pattern. While this is usually a reversal pattern in a downtrend if broken to the upside, the price has failed to reach the higher boundary as it got rejected from the $18K resistance level and the 50-day moving average located at the same price zone. Currently, a drop down to the $15K support area seems possible, as no other significant support level is left in the way.</p>
<p>However, the $15K area and the lower trendline of the falling wedge are located very close, increasing the chance to support the price and push it toward the $18K level once more. It would not be necessary to emphasize the importance of the mentioned support level, as its breakdown could lead to another blood bath.</p>

<h3>The 4-Hour Chart:</h3>
<p>On the 4-hour timeframe, a classic bearish market structure is developing, similar to the higher timeframe. The price has broken below the $16,800 minor support level after failing the recently formed bullish trendline. The $16,800 level and the broken trendline are now considered resistance, while the former is already pushing the price to the downside.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the RSI indicator, while recovering from an oversold state, is way below the 50 mark, signaling a strong bearish momentum that could soon bring the price down toward the key $15,500 area.</p>

<h2>On-chain Analysis</h2>
<p>By: Edris</p>
<h3>Bitcoin Exchange Whale Ratio</h3>
<p>The Exchange Whale ratio metric is typically used to demonstrate whales&#8217; behavior, as it is calculated by dividing the inflow of whales to the exchanges by the total inflows daily. During the last cycle and the first phase of the 2018 bear market, this metric was on a significant rise as many whales were selling their coins on the exchanges to protect their profits and reduce their risk. This behavior led to a gruesome downtrend. However, the metric started a downtrend in the second phase, as the price began to recover and start a new bull run.</p>
<p>Recently, the same behavior has been witnessed as the whales are depositing less coins onto the exchanges compared to the rest of the market participants, which could signal that a price bottom could be near. However, this could also be a consequence of FTX&#8217;s insolvency and eventual bankruptcy, as the whales do not trust the exchanges enough to hold their coins on them. This decline in the Whale Ratio metric could trigger a potential supply shock and finally lead to a price bottom formation soon.</p>

<p>For the most part, altcoins have also been standing still over he past day, unable to produce any meaningful increases, with certain exceptions.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[In the near future, people will travel a lot. But first, they will visit their destinations in the metaverse.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The extended COVID-19 lockdown changed the travel industry —and the lifestyle of millions of people. But now that the pandemic seems to be under control, businesses are looking to rise from the ashes with new ideas to engage customers, and the metaverse seems like an exciting topic to explore.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.booking.com/articles/travelpredictions2023.htmlen-2023-2335269" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">survey</a> conducted by the popular traveling portal Booking.com to more than 24,000 people in 32 countries, a considerable number of users responded that the metaverse could help them define their travel destination.</p>
<h2>Next Vacation Destination: The Metaverse</h2>
<p>The survey shows a significant interest among travelers in virtually experiencing destinations while choosing a place to spend their vacation. Of all of them, the most inclined to experience virtual trips in the metaverse are those from Generation Z (45%) and Millennials (43%). More than half of the respondents claimed that virtual reality is a viable tool when choosing a good travel destination.</p>
<p>Booking.com also says that 4,574 respondents were willing to travel to new places only upon having experienced them in the metaverse. Also, 35% of respondents are willing to spend several days in the metaverse to get a perspective on the environment and places that might catch their attention.</p>
<p>According to Booking.com, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/virtual-reality-experience-in-your-palm-special-interview-with-rapid-growing-sensorium-platform/" data-wpel-link="internal">virtual reality</a> and blockchain technologies will allow users to experience anything from a sunny beach to the desert without being physically on-site. However, 60% of respondents still believe that the experience offered by the metaverse and other virtual technologies does not compare to actually being there in person.</p>
<h2>The Future of the Internet</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/the-metaverse-is-still-popular-despite-bear-market-dappradar/" data-wpel-link="internal">metaverse</a> is a concept created to describe a persistent online 3D universe that combines multiple virtual spaces. It is like a futuristic vision of the Internet where users work, meet, play, and socialize together in an alternate reality.</p>
<p>Video games offer the closest metaverse experience there is; the developers have pushed the boundaries of what a game is by organizing in-game events and designing virtual economies. With that in mind, the metaverse is a virtual environment that attempts to replicate the real world on a digital foundation.</p>
<p>Some companies, like Microsoft and Meta, are working on their own virtual worlds, or &#8220;metaverses.&#8221; But other projects, like The Sandbox and <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/decentraland-guide-and-review/" data-wpel-link="internal">Decentraland</a>, are using the decentralized technology of blockchain to build metaverses that offer more privacy, openness, and depth. These initiatives have the backing of many fans who believe in their values and are willing to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/animoca-brands-unveils-2b-metaverse-fund/" data-wpel-link="internal">financially support</a> them.</p>
