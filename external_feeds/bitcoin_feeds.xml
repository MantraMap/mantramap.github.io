It will also erode the value of the U.S. dollar, &#8220;making it more likely that the U.S. dollar will lose its world reserve currency status sooner rather than later,&#8221; he cautioned.</strong></p>
<h2>Ron Paul Warns of U.S. Dollar Losing World Reserve Currency Status</h2>
<p>Former U.S. Representative Ron Paul warned in an article published on the Ron Paul Institute website Monday that the Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA) will have a number of negative consequences for the United States, including eroding the U.S. dollar’s dominance. Paul is an American author, physician, and retired politician. The former representative from Texas established The Ron Paul Liberty Report in 2015 to provide insightful opinions and analysis on current issues impacting our lives and finances.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden signed the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/legislation/2023/06/03/press-release-bills-signed-h-r-346-h-r-3746/#:~:text=H.R.%203746%2C%20the%20%E2%80%9CFiscal%20Responsibility,for%20the%20VA%20Toxic%20Exposures">Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023</a> into law on Saturday after intense negotiations in Congress due to the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/treasury-secretary-yellen-revises-debt-default-date-us-government-could-exhaust-funds-by-june-5/">looming possibility</a> of the U.S. government defaulting on its debt obligations.</p>
<p>While the Act helps the U.S. avoid having to default on its debt on <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/treasury-secretary-yellen-revises-debt-default-date-us-government-could-exhaust-funds-by-june-5/">June 5</a>, Paul stressed: “It allows the government to continue adding trillions of dollars of debt that will be monetized by the Federal Reserve.” The former congressman cautioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>Of course, this default will be felt by the people in the form of an inflation tax. This inflation tax may be the worst of all taxes, because it is both hidden and regressive.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Politicians love to point the finger at greedy corporations, labor unions, and even consumers for increasing prices instead of taking responsibility for the legislation they pass that incentivizes the Federal Reserve to create more inflation,” he continued.</p>
<p>Paul explained that Republican supporters of the bill claim it begins to roll back the excessive spending of the Biden years. However, &#8220;it does not save taxpayers a dime,&#8221; he asserted, noting that “It makes no attempt to actually cut spending, much less eradicate any illegitimate and unconstitutional government agencies, cabinet departments, or programs.”</p>
<p>Moreover, the former Texas representative detailed that “defense” is the third largest item in the budget, adding that “Biden’s military budget is the largest in United States history and probably world history.”</p>

<p>Paul opined: “Hawks alienate current and potential allies with their hyper-interventionist policies. This along with the increasing national debt is leading to increased challenges to the U.S. dollar&#8217;s status as the world’s reserve currency.”</p>
<p>Highlighting that the U.S. dollar&#8217;s global currency status &#8220;is the only reason Congress has been able to run up such a huge deficit without causing a major economic crisis,” Paul cautioned that besides escalating &#8220;government spending, debt, and deficits,&#8221; the Fiscal Responsibility Act will risk the U.S. dollar’s dominance. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>It will also further erode the value of the United States dollar, thus making it more likely that the U.S. dollar will lose its world reserve currency status sooner rather than later.</p></blockquote>

The U.S. dollar is the fundamental reserve currency,” Dimon said, emphasizing: “We shouldn&#8217;t be challenging that.”</strong></p>
<h2>JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon on De-Dollarization and USD Hegemony</h2>
<p>Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, shared his views on the U.S. economy and the U.S. dollar as the world&#8217;s reserve currency with the press after meeting with House Democrats on Capitol Hill on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Noting that the U.S. economy is &#8220;still doing fine,&#8221; Dimon described: &#8220;Consumers are in great shape, home prices have gone up for 10 years, asset prices have gone up, debt&#8217;s in good position.&#8221; However, he noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have issues down the road.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dimon specifically mentioned excessive spending, the Federal Reserve&#8217;s quantitative tightening, the Russia-Ukraine war, and uncertainties surrounding oil, gas, and energy. &#8220;We have to deal with those. Hopefully, we&#8217;ll get through all of that,&#8221; he opined.</p>
<p>The JPMorgan boss also commented on the debt ceiling. Last week, Congress passed a bill to suspend the debt ceiling limit until January 2025, which President Joe Biden signed into law on Saturday. Without this bill, the U.S. government would have <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/treasury-secretary-yellen-revises-debt-default-date-us-government-could-exhaust-funds-by-june-5/">defaulted</a> on its debt obligations on June 5, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen had warned.</p>

<p>“I think it&#8217;s fabulous we didn&#8217;t have a debt ceiling crisis. I think it&#8217;s great,&#8221; Dimon said, reiterating his preference to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-in-favor-of-abolishing-debt-limit-states-getting-close-to-default-can-cause-panic/">get rid</a> of the debt ceiling altogether. &#8220;If I had my druthers, I&#8217;d get rid of it one day,&#8221; the JPMorgan executive noted. He added:</p>
<blockquote><p>The United States is the fundamental foundation of the global economy. The U.S. dollar is the fundamental reserve currency. People rely on the consistency standards that we have, the rule of law, or investor protections. We shouldn&#8217;t be challenging that.</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, a growing number of countries are ramping up efforts to de-dollarize and use national currencies in place of the USD in trade settlements, including the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-discusses-brics-currencys-prospect-of-becoming-global-currency/">BRICS nations</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/10-southeast-asian-nations-challenge-dollar-dominance-with-push-for-local-currencies/">ASEAN members</a>. There is also a proposal for a common BRICS currency that is expected to be <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-leaders-set-to-discuss-common-currency-to-challenge-us-dollar-dominance-in-upcoming-summit/">discussed</a> at the economic bloc&#8217;s upcoming leaders&#8217; summit.</p>

<h2>Binance CEO CZ Challenged by SEC Summons as Legal Battles Escalate</h2>
<p>On Wednesday, several social media accounts <a href="https://twitter.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1666509101671522324?s=20">shared a summons</a> intended for the CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, also known as CZ. The document states that CZ must respond upon being served, and at that time, he will have 21 days to address the court. &#8220;If you fail to respond, judgment by default will be entered against you for the relief demanded in the complaint,” the court filing details.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The summons necessitates a response and bears the signature of the court clerk. CZ was served at an address in Malta, and he <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1666513302304727059?s=20">shared</a> a tweet about the document on Twitter. The summons comes in the wake of the recent <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-faces-legal-action-by-sec-for-violating-us-securities-laws/">SEC lawsuit</a> against Binance and CZ, accusing them of operating an unregistered exchange, brokerage, and clearing house, as well as listing unregistered securities. Furthermore, the SEC has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-seeks-court-approval-to-freeze-binance-us-crypto-assets-citing-customer-safety-concerns/">filed a motion</a> to freeze the assets linked to Binance&#8217;s American subsidiary, Binance US.</p>
<p>Binance has <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/sec-complaint-aims-to-unilaterally-define-crypto-market-structure-8707489117122437402">disputed the allegations</a> made by the U.S. securities regulator and stated that the company plans to &#8220;vigorously defend” the platform. The largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world in terms of trade volume stated that the SEC&#8217;s “refusal to productively engage with us is just another example of the Commission’s misguided and conscious refusal to provide much-needed clarity and guidance to the digital asset industry.”</p>

<p>The U.S. securities watchdog filed a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-becomes-the-latest-target-of-sec-accused-of-unregistered-brokerage-and-securities-violations/">lawsuit</a> against Coinbase the day after it lodged a complaint against Binance and CZ. Additionally, several states have issued show-cause orders to Coinbase, alleging that the company has listed unregistered securities and targeted its staking service. In response to the SEC&#8217;s allegations, Coinbase has <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/06/06/bitcoin-and-ethereum-sag-as-sec-suit-against-coinbase-weighs-on-crypto-market/#">argued</a> that the regulator&#8217;s enforcement actions without clarity are “hurting America’s economic competitiveness.”</p>

In lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase, the regulator claims that a number of tokens listed by the trading platforms are unregistered securities. </strong></p>
<h2>Robinhood Reviews Cryptocurrency Offerings Amid U.S. Crackdown on Leading Exchanges</h2>
<p>U.S.-based online broker Robinhood Markets is taking a look at its digital coin offerings following the SEC&#x2019;s decision to crack down on Binance, the world&#x2019;s largest crypto exchange, and Coinbase, the leading digital asset exchange in the United States.</p>
<p>The financial services company is &#x201C;actively reviewing&#x201D; the regulator&#x2019;s analysis &#x201C;to determine what, if any, actions to take,&#x201D; the firm&#x2019;s Chief Legal Compliance and Corporate Affairs Officer Dan Gallagher said, quoted by Bloomberg.</p>
<p>Gallagher, who is a former SEC commissioner, announced the move when he testified in Congress before the House Agriculture Committee in a meeting devoted to digital assets. Robinhood&#x2019;s app facilitates trades of cryptocurrencies, alongside stocks and exchange-traded funds.</p>

<p>His comments come after the SEC took legal action against <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-faces-legal-action-by-sec-for-violating-us-securities-laws/">Binance</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-becomes-the-latest-target-of-sec-accused-of-unregistered-brokerage-and-securities-violations/">Coinbase</a> this week with the securities regulator arguing in the lawsuits that several of the tokens listed by the two major cryptocurrency exchanges are in fact unregistered securities.</p>
<p><a href="https://robinhood.com/us/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robinhood</a> users can choose between 18 different coins as the brokerage provides a relatively limited access to crypto assets in comparison with the hundreds of digital currencies listed by the exchanges. The SEC considers some of them, solana, cardano and polygon, for example, unregistered securities.</p>
<p>At the same time, the SEC&#x2019;s crackdown led to a significant <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-records-significant-outflows-of-btc-eth-and-stablecoins-exceeding-1-45-billion/">outflows</a> of major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> as well as stablecoins from Binance on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the regulator also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-seeks-court-approval-to-freeze-binance-us-crypto-assets-citing-customer-safety-concerns/">seeks</a> court approval to freeze crypto assets linked to Binance&#x2019;s U.S.-based subsidiary.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Binance Has Controlled the Largest Bitcoin Wallet Since March 2021</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin&#x2019;s auditable and transparent network allows people to view the largest bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) holders, commonly referred to as the &#x201C;<a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html">Bitcoin Rich List</a>.&#x201D; Currently, the largest <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> wallet is controlled by Binance, known as the &#x201C;<a href="https://oxt.me/address/34xp4vRoCGJym3xR7yCVPFHoCNxv4Twseo">Binance Cold Wallet</a>,&#x201D; which holds 248,597 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, accounting for 1.28% of the entire <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> supply. The wallet was first observed in October 2018 and has since received 790 incoming transfers and made 42 outgoing transfers.</p>

<p dir="ltr">It wasn&#x2019;t until 2021 that Binance&#x2019;s cold wallet address became the largest in existence. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210203040331/https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html">Archived data</a> shows that on February 3, 2021, Huobi controlled the largest <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> address, which held 141,452 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, while the second-largest wallet, holding 110,011 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, belonged to Bitfinex. On that day, Binance&#x2019;s cold wallet address was the fourth largest, holding approximately 92,881 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210228140206/https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html">By the end</a> of February 2021, Binance&#x2019;s cold wallet had moved up to the second-largest position, just below Huobi&#x2019;s wallet.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210310135441/https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html">On March 10, 2021</a>, or 819 days ago, the Binance cold wallet became the largest <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> wallet in existence, holding a balance of 143,528 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> on that day. Since then, it has remained the largest wallet, currently holding 248,597 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. However, in June 2021, it reached an all-time high of approximately 299,427 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. The Binance cold wallet address has had minimal activity this year, with the exception of sending 2,000 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> on January 7. Binance&#x2019;s control of the top <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> wallet is a significant departure from the situation nine years ago.</p>
<p class="p1"></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">From DPR to Bitfinex, Huobi, and Binance</h2>
<p dir="ltr">On <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140209105237/https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html">February 9, 2014</a>, the U.S. government held the largest <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> wallet after seizing assets from Silk Road administrator Dread Pirate Roberts (DPR). In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150215073913/https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html">February 2015</a>, after the government sold the DPR stash, the &#x201C;<a href="https://oxt.me/address/19KJZ5aqWnrrCaNAS5Pbd4uknPFBxjALRt">19KJZ</a>&#x201D; address became the largest, holding 180,060 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. Data from the rich list in 2016 is unknown, as a snapshot was not taken that year. However, in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170410225441/https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html">April 2017</a>, Bitstamp held the largest bitcoin wallet, holding 128,440 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180106184932/https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html">January 2018</a>, the largest <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> wallet was a <a href="https://oxt.me/address/16rCmCmbuWDhPjWTrpQGaU3EPdZF7MTdUk">Bittrex cold wallet</a>, which once held 179,203 bitcoin.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190104081052/https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html">January 2019</a>, the Bitfinex cold wallet was the largest bitcoin address, with a cold wallet associated with Binance as the second largest. However, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200103122256/https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html">by 2020</a>, the Huobi wallet became the leading <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> wallet, with the older Binance wallet becoming the fifth largest, holding approximately 89,684 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. Huobi held the top position until March 10, 2021, when the new Binance cold wallet (<a href="https://oxt.me/address/34xp4vRoCGJym3xR7yCVPFHoCNxv4Twseo">34xp4</a>) took over as the largest <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> wallet.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Binance cold wallet currently holds 248,597 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, which is approximately 70,587 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> more than the second-largest <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> wallet controlled by Bitfinex, holding 178,010 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. It is also the only bitcoin address with over 200,000 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. While Binance has seen a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-records-significant-outflows-of-btc-eth-and-stablecoins-exceeding-1-45-billion/">significant number of bitcoins leave</a> the centralized crypto exchange in the last few days, not a single satoshi has left the massive wallet since January. The address does receive <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> dust (small fractions) transfers regularly, almost on a daily basis.</p>

Yellen cited Treasury reports on cryptocurrencies that have pinpointed various risks linked to the fast-growing sector.</strong></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Yellen Sees ‘Holes in the System Where Additional Regulation Would Be Appropriate’</h2>
<p dir="ltr">During a &#8220;Squawk Box&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/SquawkCNBC/status/1666421098286596097?s=20">interview</a> on CNBC with Andrew Ross Sorkin on Wednesday morning, the conversation ranged from the debt ceiling to the state of the U.S. economy but also delved into digital currencies in light of recent lawsuits filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission against <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-faces-legal-action-by-sec-for-violating-us-securities-laws/">Binance</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-becomes-the-latest-target-of-sec-accused-of-unregistered-brokerage-and-securities-violations/">Coinbase</a>. Yellen alluded to Treasury reports examining crypto, a requirement issued by President Joe Biden&#8217;s executive order on the topic.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Yellen fervently believes that increased regulation is necessary within the crypto domain and advocates for Congress to take action and establish appropriate policies. &#8220;We&#8217;ve identified a number of risks [with crypto]. I&#8217;m supportive of those agencies to use the tools they have,&#8221; Yellen told Sorkin. Yellen added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">I see some holes in the system where additional regulation would be appropriate. We&#8217;d like to work with Congress to see additional regulation pass.</p>
</blockquote>

<p dir="ltr">On numerous occasions, Yellen has endorsed stringent regulations for cryptocurrencies. During February&#8217;s G20 meeting, she <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/janet-yellen-says-critical-to-establish-strong-crypto-regulation-we-havent-suggested-outright-banning/">informed</a> reporters that establishing a robust regulatory framework was crucial. In November 2022, Yellen <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-treasurys-yellen-says-crypto-doesnt-have-adequate-regulation-calls-ftx-collapse-a-lehman-moment/">referred</a> to the FTX collapse as a &#8220;Lehman moment&#8221; and emphasized that the crypto industry necessitates “adequate regulation.” Yellen’s latest comments with Sorkin surfaced after SEC Chair Gary Gensler appeared on CNBC just one day prior, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chairman-gensler-stresses-existing-fiat-digital-currencies-are-sufficient-amid-coinbase-and-binance-actions/">declaring</a> that &#8220;we don’t need more digital currency.”</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em><strong>What are your thoughts on Janet Yellen&#8217;s call for increased regulation in the crypto industry? Do you believe stricter measures are necessary to address the risks involved, or do you have concerns about stifling innovation?

The surge came as cryptocurrency markets attempted to bounce back from Tuesday&#x2019;s drubbing. <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> was another notable gainer, moving 5% higher on Wednesday. </strong></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Pepe (PEPE)</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Pepe (PEPE), which is known for being a deflationary meme coin, rose by over 13% in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Following a low of $0.0000009764 on Tuesday, PEPE/USD made a move to a peak of $0.000001257 earlier today.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As a result of the move, pepe briefly broke out of a price ceiling at $0.000001200, however was unable to sustain the move.</p>

<p dir="ltr">At the time of writing, the coin is currently trading at $0.000001135, which comes as the relative strength index (RSI) sits below its own ceiling.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The index is tracking at 49.15, which is marginally below a key level of resistance at the 53.00 mark.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Should bulls push past this point, there is a good chance that PEPE will make another move above $0.000001200.</p>
<p dir="ltr"></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a></h2>
<p dir="ltr">In addition to PEPE, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> also made strong gains during Wednesday&#x2019;s session, with price jumping by as much as 5%.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>/USD rose to an intraday high of $0.5371 earlier in the day, which comes following Tuesday&#x2019;s low at $0.4982.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Today&#x2019;s rally saw the token formerly known as ripple briefly break through a ceiling at $0.5330.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Historically, this level has birthed significant bearish pressure, which seems to be why earlier bulls opted to liquidate positions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This comes as the RSI also failed to break its own ceiling at the 63.00 level, and is currently tracking at 62.53.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the event that bulls eventually surge beyond this point, the next target will likely be $0.6000.</p>

The statistics show that on the American crypto trading platform, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> is trading almost $400 higher for those utilizing the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD pair.</strong></p>
<p><em>Editor&#x2019;s Note: At 1:30 p.m. Eastern Time on June 7, 2023, on Binance US, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> is trading for $1,444 higher per bitcoin than the average global exchange rate. <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> is trading for $100 higher per unit on Binance US.</em></p>
<h2>Binance US Witnesses Bitcoin Premium Amidst Regulatory Turmoil</h2>
<p>In light of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#x2019;s (SEC) <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-faces-legal-action-by-sec-for-violating-us-securities-laws/">recent lawsuit</a> against , as well as the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-seeks-court-approval-to-freeze-binance-us-crypto-assets-citing-customer-safety-concerns/">motion to freeze assets</a> connected to Binance US &#x2014; its American subsidiary &#x2014; <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> is being traded at a premium on the U.S. platform. At 7:30 a.m. Eastern Time on June 7, a single bitcoin on Binance US is worth $397.29 more than the worldwide average.</p>

<p>This premium exclusively impacts the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD pair on Binance US; bitcoin pairs tied to stablecoins such as <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a> and USDC are displaying standard prices. Tracking indicates that the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD pair also has a premium, which is around $25 higher than the typical ethereum price. This development comes after Binance US advised its clients in March that &#x201C;certain USD deposit services will be temporarily unavailable.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Moreover, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-binance-us-struggles-to-secure-banking-partner-amid-regulatory-crackdown-on-crypto-industry/">reports</a> released in early April suggested that Binance US was struggling to secure a banking partner in the United States. Currently, Binance US&#x2019; <a href="https://www.binance.us/status">status page</a> confirms that though ACH transfers are accessible, there are complications with debit card and wire services. Furthermore, Binance&#x2019;s international exchange faced <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-australia-users-selling-bitcoin-at-discount-ahead-of-aud-withdrawals-halt/">pricing inconsistencies</a> in Australia when AUD withdrawals were suspended.</p>

<p>Over the most recent 24-hour period, Binance US registered $255 million in trade volume. This report comes after the substantial outflow that Binance saw since June 3; Bitcoin.com News <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-records-significant-outflows-of-btc-eth-and-stablecoins-exceeding-1-45-billion/">reported</a> that $1.45 billion worth was withdrawn from the global exchange. Additionally, according to Binance US&#x2019; status page, &#x201C;over-the-counter (OTC) services and select convert trading pairs are temporarily unavailable.&#x201D;</p>

<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) bounced back above the $27,000 level on Wednesday, as traders moved to buy the recent dip in price.</p>
<p>Following a low of $25,434.87 on Tuesday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD raced to an intraday high of $27,332.18 in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>This move saw bitcoin climb away from its weakest point since March 17, when it was at a low of $24,946.</p>

<p>Overall, price has also risen back above a key support point at $26,300, with the relative strength index (RSI) hovering near a similar area.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, price strength is tracking at 45.67, which is below a resistance level of 47.00.</p>
<p>The 10-day (red) moving average also remains above its 25-day (blue) counterpart, which could be a positive sign for longer-term bulls.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) also made strong gains in today&#x2019;s session, with prices closing in on a reentry above the $1,900 level.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD hit a peak of $1,896.22 on Wednesday, which comes less than 24 hours after the price was below $1,800.</p>
<p>Tuesday&#x2019;s decline sent ethereum to its weakest point since May 25, which was the last time the cryptocurrency was at a floor at $1,790.</p>

<p>From the chart, it appears that today&#x2019;s rebound came as the RSI bounced from its own floor at 44.00.</p>
<p>The index is now tracking at 51.16, with the next visible point of resistance being at the 53.00 mark.</p>

Folwer was also ordered to pay a &#8220;forfeiture of $740,249,140.52 and restitution in the amount of $53,189,261.80 to the Alliance of American Football.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Fowler&#8217;s Lies &#8216;Exposed the U.S. Financial System to Serious Risk&#8217;</h2>
<p>The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York announced on June 5 that Reginald Fowler, the former co-owner of Minnesota Vikings, has been sentenced to 75 months in prison &#8220;for arranging to process more than $700 million of unregulated transactions&#8221; on behalf of cryptocurrency exchanges. In addition, Fowler has been ordered to pay a &#8220;forfeiture of $740,249,140.52 and restitution in the amount of $53,189,261.80 to the AAF (Alliance of American Football).&#8221;</p>
<p>As per a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/former-co-owner-minnesota-vikings-sentenced-75-months-prison-providing-shadow-banking">statement</a> issued by U.S. Attorney Damian Williams, Fowler was also punished for misrepresenting the true nature of his business and for lying about his net worth. Detailing Fowler’s alleged criminal activities which also threatened the country’s financial system, Williams said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Reginald Fowler evaded federal law by processing hundreds of millions of dollars of unregulated transactions on behalf of cryptocurrency exchanges as a shadow bank. He did so by lying to legitimate U.S. financial institutions, which exposed the U.S. financial system to serious risk. He then victimized a professional football league by lying about his net worth in exchange for a substantial portion of the league.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Fowler&#8217;s &#8216;Illegal Money Transmission Service&#8217;</h2>
<p>Citing court documents, U.S. Attorneys said sometime in 2018, Fowler began working with crypto companies that touted themselves as platforms that enabled individuals to seamlessly swap fiat currency for cryptocurrency. However, at the time, many United States-based banks were unwilling to have dealings with crypto exchanges. To overcome this challenge, Fowler’s crypto firms &#8220;lied to banks in order to open accounts that were used to process cryptocurrency transactions without the banks’ knowledge.&#8221;</p>
<p>In just ten months of operating the unlicensed business, Fowler and his partners had &#8220;processed approximately $750 million in cryptocurrency transactions in various currencies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Concerning Fowler’s reported acquisition of a significant stake in the American football league, the statement claimed that the former co-owner of the Minnesota Vikings had &#8220;falsely claimed personal ownership of GTS funds that, in fact, belonged to clients of his illegal money transmission service.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition, U.S. attorneys also accused Fowler of failing to disclose to the AAF the seizure of GTS funds by the government just before his investment in the league. Fowler&#8217;s lies are one of the factors that forced the AAF to declare bankruptcy in 2019, the attorney&#8217;s statement added.</p>
