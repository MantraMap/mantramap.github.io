<p>In a bold move, Coinbase has requested the court to throw out a lawsuit lodged against it in June by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>



<p>The San Francisco-based digital asset exchange said in an August 4 court filing that the SEC’s “claims must be dismissed” because “the subject matter falls outside the agency’s delegated authority.” Coinbase noted that Judge Analisa Torres’ recent decision with Ripple bolsters their argument.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sec-violated-due-process"><strong>“SEC Violated Due Process”</strong></h2>



<p>Lawyers representing Coinbase have filed a motion to dismiss the SEC lawsuit. They accused the SEC of exceeding its regulatory authority and engaging in regulatory overreach.</p>



<p>The regulator in June <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-suffers-double-whammy-as-sec-and-state-regulators-act-against-exchange-for-unregistered-securities/">slapped </a>America’s largest crypto exchange with a suit, alleging that it operated for years as an unlicensed securities exchange. The SEC even went ahead to name 13 tokens as examples of coins it believed qualified as securities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coinbase is now arguing that none of the digital assets and services it offers are securities.“Because as a matter of law none of them [crypto assets] are, the claims must be dismissed,” reads the filing.</p>



<p>&#8220;The transactions over Coinbase’s platform and Prime are not, and do not involve, contractual undertakings to deliver future value reflecting the income, profits, or assets of a business. They are commodity sales, with the obligations on both sides discharged entirely the moment the digital token is delivered in exchange for payment,&#8221; the filing added.</p>



<p>Coinbase further said the SEC had “violated due process, abused its discretion, and abandoned its own earlier interpretations of the securities laws” in claiming certain regulatory control over the exchange. According to the crypto company, the SEC’s challenges to its staking program “fail as a matter of law.” Coinbase has asked the court to dismiss the case, arguing the SEC’s enforcement action was “punitive” and characterized an overreach in its statutory authority granted by Congress.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-similarity-to-xrp-lawsuit"><strong>Similarity To XRP Lawsuit</strong></h2>



<p>Coinbase’s motion to dismiss additionally cited last month’s verdict in the Ripple vs SEC case, indicating that the underlying facts were &#8220;substantially identical to those alleged here.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Judge Torres determined that Ripple&#8217;s sales of XRP on exchanges weren&#8217;t securities transactions, but the firm’s direct sales to institutional customers were.</p>



<p>The SEC this year has amplified its crackdown on the crypto sector. This is largely due to its chairperson Gary Gensler&#8217;s assertions that most crypto platforms are selling unregistered securities to clients. Besides Coinbase, the regulator has also taken legal action against <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">Binance</a>, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/secs-crackdown-on-krakens-staking-program-puts-other-players-on-notice/">Kraken</a>, and Genesis. The SEC has also gone after Tron’s <a href="https://zycrypto.com/trons-trx-plummets-11-after-u-s-sec-sues-justin-sun-for-securities-violations/">Justin Sun</a>, Terraform Labs’ <a href="https://zycrypto.com/do-kwon-terraform-labs-hit-with-sec-lawsuit-alleging-securities-fraud/">Do Kwon</a>, and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-continues-its-regulation-by-enforcement-spree-charges-richard-heart-of-hex-with-1-billion-securities-fraud/">Richard Heart</a> under Gensler’s watch.</p>

<p>Shiba Inu lead developer Shytoshi Kusama has announced plans to mint the remaining BONE tokens and renounce the BONE contract before the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-run-towards-0-001-shib-price-in-play-as-ethereum-to-shibarium-bridge-goes-live-in-beta/">Shibarium launch</a>.</p>



<p>The announcement, which was made in a Thursday blog, said, “<em>With the incoming launch of Shibarium, our own Layer 2 blockchain, and much more, in the next few days you will notice that we will&nbsp;mint the remaining supply of BONE and renounce the bone contract&nbsp;so that no further minting will be possible.”</em></p>



<p>Kusama further shed light on the significance of the decision, emphasising that it is necessary to kickstart the blockchain, as a substantial portion of BONE will be allocated to validators in the upcoming layer two protocol. Additionally, he noted that BONE would play a crucial role as the token delegators use to claim rewards, as the gas token for Shibarium, and for technology governance within the ecosystem.</p>



<p>As <em>ZyCrypto</em> <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-monster-move-draws-near-amid-imminent-launch-of-shibarium-in-august/">reported</a>, the highly anticipated Shibarium is set to go live after a Toronto conference in August. The platform aims to address scalability and data bottlenecks by bundling off-chain transactions into a single layer 1 transaction, thereby reducing fees and data load. Since last week, developers have been actively testing the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-primed-for-huge-price-outburst-after-shibarium-beta-bridge-goes-live-for-public-testing/">Ethereum Bridge</a>, a crucial part of the project.</p>



<p>Shiba Inu&#8217;s journey to decentralization has been remarkable, as the cryptocurrency rapidly rose to a top 15 position in the market, driven by the power of its community. With Shibarium&#8217;s launch, the ecosystem is poised for further growth, especially in the metaverse and gaming applications, focusing on the thriving NFT sector.</p>



<p>The testnet for Shibarium has already seen significant activity, with millions of transactions from numerous wallets, indicating high demand for the network. Further, to support projects on the new platform, the developers recently announced plans to introduce DoggyDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization governed by token holders.</p>



<p>Shiba Inu, which began as a meme coin, has transformed into a serious project with its blockchain network and DApp ecosystem. The launch of Shibarium is expected to strengthen the fundamentals of the SHIB token, adding to its appeal in the crypto market.</p>



<p>As the crypto world awaits the Shibarium launch, SHIB ecosystem tokens have shown mixed movements, reflecting excitement and uncertainty. Nonetheless, Shiba Inu&#8217;s dedication to decentralization has garnered worldwide attention and support from enthusiasts. Today, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted in a <a href="https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1686152761505685504">tweet</a> how in July, a massive 3.30 trillion SHIB were withdrawn from established exchanges, amounting to about $28 million, which shows increased incentive to hold the cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>With the countdown to Shibarium&#8217;s launch underway, the Shiba Inu community has expressed high hopes that the event will significantly boost the ecosystem&#8217;s token price to $0.001.</p>

<p>According to a report by Semafor on Thursday, the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, is looking to partner with a financial data provider to create a trading hub within its app. Major financial service providers have received calls for proposals from the corporation, according to sources with knowledge of the situation. The company specifically requested suggestions relating to financial content, real-time stock data, and other valuable features.</p>



<p>The report stated that prospective bidders were requested to specify how much money they would be willing to invest in the project. However, it&#8217;s unclear if any companies have submitted any offers at this time.</p>



<p>In a post on X&#8217;s platform, its owner Elon Musk stated that he is unaware of any ongoing efforts in this particular area. While Musk himself denied claims that X is working on this, the more significant question is whether an app like this can succeed in Western countries.</p>



<p>Previous attempts by companies like Meta and Alphabet to build such apps have failed, despite having more substantial financial resources than Musk. According to Foreignpolicy, WeChat, often hailed by Musk as a blueprint for an &#8216;Everything App&#8217; for the West, is inherently Chinese, and trying to copy and force it in a different environment may prove futile.</p>



<p><em>“Buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app.” Musk said prior to buying Twitter as it was then called.</em></p>



<p>China is the largest market worldwide for mobile payments and has many otherwise unbanked people, contrary to countries like the USA, UK or Europe, where most people have bank accounts and credit cards. Another challenge for X as a payment app could be the American love for credit cards and the fierce competition among financial services providers, creating a significant obstacle.</p>



<p>Regardless of whether X is seeking outside help with the &#8216;Everything App,&#8217; Musk has long been clear about his vision for it. He said he wanted to give X users &#8220;the ability to conduct your entire financial world&#8221; with X. In this context, he changed the Twitter name to X, adding, &#8220;so we must bid adieu to the bird.&#8221;</p>



<p>And then there is the other question on the mind of many in the crypto industry, will X include crypto payments? As Real-Vision CEO Raoul Pal mentioned earlier in July that &#8220;(Elon) will use crypto to be able to make global payments for creators etc. My guess is he uses Doge.”</p>



<p>Elon Musk has been openly fond of what he refers to as the &#8220;people&#8217;s crypto&#8221; and has, on previous occasions, triggered surges in Dogecoin&#8217;s price. Since the transformation of Twitter into X, Dogecoin has experienced an impressive rally but failed to reach 1 cent. It remains to be seen if X will integrate Dogecoin or other cryptocurrencies into its new payment system.</p>

<p>Ripple, the San Francisco-based fintech company, used to publish a quarterly report called the ‘XRP Markets Report,&#8217; wherein it voluntarily disclosed its sales of XRP, among other things. However, after <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">achieving a partial win</a> in the legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over whether XRP qualifies as a security, Ripple has decided to make some changes. The company accused the SEC of using the reports as weapons against them in the lawsuit.</p>



<p>In its<a href="https://ripple.com/insights/q2-2023-xrp-markets-report/"> current report</a>, presented in a different format, Ripple referred to the SEC&#8217;s approach as “Ironic for an agency that touts transparency and disclosure. Accordingly, Ripple is re-evaluating the role and contents of this report going forward […]”</p>



<p>Rather than discussing crypto sentiments and XRP sales, the current report focused on clarifying some misunderstandings about the ruling.</p>



<p>Before delving into the misconceptions, it&#8217;s essential to understand what the ruling stated, according to Ripple. XRP is not considered a security in its inherent nature. The sales of XRP by Ripple on exchanges, as well as the sales made by its executives, are also not considered securities. Additionally, other distributions of Ripple&#8217;s XRP, such as those to developers, charities, and employees, are not classified as securities. However, it should be noted that certain sales conducted by Ripple under written contracts were deemed to be investment contracts and thus fall under the category of securities.</p>



<p>Here are the 6 Misconceptions About the XRP Ruling:</p>



<p><strong>No. 1 – A split decision?</strong></p>



<p>Regarding the question of whether the decision by Judge Torres is a split decision, Ripple affirms that it has always maintained that XRP is not a security, and the Court reaffirmed this clearly. The Court&#8217;s position, according to Ripple, is that tokens themselves, as they are, are not securities, which is fundamentally a victory for the industry, not only Ripple.</p>



<p><strong>No. 2 – Is XRP a security in some situations?</strong></p>



<p>Ripple explains that the court has stated that XRP, being a digital token, does not qualify as an investment contract and, thus is not a security. However, under certain circumstances, like when combined with promises, it can be sold as an investment contract.</p>



<p>But in such cases, the fundamental nature of XRP (or any asset, like an orange grove or a gold bar) does not change to become a security. Whether something is an investment contract depends on the specific transaction, where an investment of money is made in a common enterprise, with the expectation of profits based on the efforts of the seller or a third party. The same asset can be sold in a simple buy/sell transaction or as part of an investment contract, but the distinction is crucial, and the SEC&#8217;s contrary claims have no legal basis.</p>



<p><strong>No. 3 – Because a share of a stock is always a security, XRP, too, must be one?</strong></p>



<p>This is determined case by case by looking at the actual transaction and depends on whether there is an investment contract, which is different from a share of stock, which is always a security. This is an important differentiation because the company behind the share has a fiduciary duty to the holder of the share.</p>



<p><strong>No. 4 – Does the decision only protect sophisticated investors but not retail?</strong></p>



<p>Ripple emphasizes that all investors deserve protection; the court does not deny this. It merely said that the SEC&#8217;s jurisdiction ends where no security is involved. According to Ripple, investor protection is a matter of policy and must be addressed by legislators with a mandate to do so. Ripple also states that the SEC&#8217;s enforcement actions have been wrong and hurt retail investors.</p>



<p><strong>No. 5 – Does the decision hurt Ripple’s business?</strong></p>



<p>This is certainly not the case, as most of Ripple’s current customers are overseas in jurisdictions that have clarified that XRP is not a security, such as Japan, Singapore, Switzerland, the UAE, and the UK.</p>



<p><strong>No. 6 – Did the court reject Ripple’s fair notice defense?</strong></p>



<p>This is only the case for Ripple’s institutional sales; fair notice defense for other transactions is still open, as the Court stated, <em>“The SEC’s theories as to the other sales in this case are potentially inconsistent with its enforcement in prior digital asset cases.”</em></p>



<p>Finally, Ripple sheds light on XRP it holds in two categories: XRP available in Ripple’s wallets and XRP locked in escrow. Between March 31, 2023, and June 30, 2023, Ripple&#8217;s XRP holdings increased from 5,506,585,918 to 5,551,119,094. Meanwhile, the total XRP subject to on-ledger escrow decreased from 42.8 billion to 41.9 billion.</p>

<p>Binance has announced the appointment of a new Deputy Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) and Global Money Laundering Reporting Officer (GMLRO) at a time when the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange grapples with regulatory challenges from several law enforcement officers worldwide over compliance issues.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-binance-beefs-up-compliance-team"><strong>Binance Beefs Up Compliance Team</strong></h2>



<p>Binance has named a new compliance-focused officer, Kristen Hecht.</p>



<p>Hecht, who previously held the position of Global Head of Corporate Compliance, will be deputy chief compliance and global money laundering reporting officer at Binance after joining the exchange eight months ago.</p>



<p>Hecht brings 17 years of experience in financial crime compliance. Earlier in her career, Hecht was the Senior Policy Advisor for the U.S. Department of the Treasury. She went on to become the Chief Compliance Officer at Meta’s crypto wallet project, Novi Financial.</p>



<p>“With her seasoned background, she understands the importance of collaborating with governments and international organizations that are critical to making sustainable advancements and fighting financial crime,” Binance Chief Compliance Officer Noah Perlman stated.</p>



<p>Hecht’s appointment comes after a string of top legal and compliance executives <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binances-cz-shrugs-off-news-of-senior-executive-personnel-resigning-as-attempts-to-spread-fud/">quit Binance</a> allegedly due to the strain of dealing with numerous probes into the exchange’s practices. Binance has firmly rejected these claims.</p>



<p>Now, as the Deputy CCO at Binance, Hecht will work closely with Perlman to improve the exchange&#8217;s compliance strategy.  And in the role of GMLRO, she will supervise money laundering units, helping them to identify and mitigate financial crime. Hecht intends to &#8220;proactively engage&#8221; with regulators, intergovernmental organizations, and industry bodies to help devise compliance programs. </p>



<p><em>“As an organization that is obsessed with its users and has come a long way toward building a best-in-class compliance program comparable to global financial institutions, I hope to raise further awareness with regulatory and industry partners about the crypto industry to build trust and collaborate in this fast-developing space.”</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-binance-s-regulatory-issues"><strong>Binance’s Regulatory Issues</strong></h2>



<p>The Hecht appointment comes as Binance continues to be in hot waters with regulators globally, including in the United States, France, Germany, and the Netherlands.</p>



<p>The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-ether-slump-as-cftc-sues-binance-and-cz-over-willful-violation-of-u-s-laws/">sued </a>Binance and its founder Changpeng Zhao in March on allegations the company deliberately offered unregistered crypto derivatives products to U.S. investors against federal laws. Additionally, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">struck </a>the exchange and Zhao with 13 charges.</p>



<p>The United States Department of Justice is also reportedly <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/08/02/2023/us-prosecutors-worry-binance-charges-could-cause-run-on-exchange">contemplating charging Binance with fraud</a> but hesitating due to concerns about a potential indictment triggering a bank run on the exchange similar to what happened with Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX back in November 2022.</p>



<p>In Europe, France’s financial judicial investigation service is investigating Binance for &#8220;acts of aggravated money laundering”. The exchange has withdrawn its request for German regulatory approval and <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/notice-on-changes-of-services-in-the-netherlands-b5a647be31cf469b87fc3337fd461ced">ceased</a> its crypto operations in the Netherlands after failing to secure a regulatory nod. </p>

<p>Ripple President Monica Long has announced the company’s plans to seek market opportunities in the United States. This development follows the historic court ruling clarifying that the payment network’s token XRP does not qualify as an unregistered security in the US.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ripple-planning-to-expand-engagement-in-u-s"><strong>Ripple Planning To Expand Engagement In U.S</strong></h2>



<p>Ripple has seemingly walked out on the threat to leave the US. Previously, the company had<a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-will-leave-the-us-for-friendlier-crypto-jurisdictions-abroad-says-exec-chris-larsen/"> threatened to move away from the U.S.</a> due to the lack of clarity from regulators about XRP’s legal status.</p>



<p>Ripple might not move after all.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRQM1BSxTmk&amp;ab_channel=CNBCInternationalTV">interview </a>with <em>CNBC</em>, Ripple’s Monica Long voiced enthusiasm for the clarity the recent court ruling offers and described how it will shape Ripple&#8217;s operational strategy from now on.</p>



<p>“It’s been a couple of weeks now since the judge’s ruling in our case, providing clarity that XRP is not a security. We’re very happy about it because we now have clarity in terms of how Ripple will operate its business going forward. And we are re-engaging with the US market.”</p>



<p>In December 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">slapped </a>Ripple with a $1.3 billion lawsuit, alleging that the company misled investors and was selling unregistered securities in the form of XRP.</p>



<p>But on July 13, federal district judge Analisa Torres of the Southern District Court of New York <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">declared </a>that programmatic sales of XRP to retail investors did not qualify as securities.</p>



<p>Long told <em>CNBC </em>on August 2 that Ripple’s operative strategy is not solely focused on the U.S. The company has experienced considerable growth in international markets, particularly where there is clear regulatory guidance regarding digital assets.</p>



<p><em>“I think that is reflective where there is regulatory clarity, places like the UK, Europe, Singapore, Dubai, and the Middle East. That’s where we see a lot of growth potential for our business around payments,” Long posited.</em></p>



<p>In particular, Ripple’s expansion in the UK has been outstanding, with the firm mulling further investments. The size of their regional office in London has more than doubled, suggesting marked growth.</p>



<p>The Ripple President further noted that the Silicon Valley decacorn operates other pivotal offices in Singapore, Dubai, and Sao Paulo, representing their extensive customer base and global reach.</p>



<p>In the meantime, the SEC has <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-verdict-ripple-chief-legal-officer-confident-in-another-win-should-sec-choose-to-appeal/">suggested </a>an appeal of Ripple&#8217;s recent courtroom victory could be coming soon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ripple is experiencing substantial growth in Asia, particularly in Singapore, where its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service witnessed a five-fold increase in transactions in 2022. The company plans to continue expanding its presence in the region sustainably. The Monetary Authority of Singapore has also granted Ripple in-principle regulatory approval, further boosting its prospects in the region.</p>



<p>Rahul Advani, Asia-Pacific (APAC) Policy Director at Ripple, said on<a href="https://twitter.com/radvanisg/status/1682676148474617858"> Twitter</a>, <em>“With good progress being made on our Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) license application, Ripple is more motivated than ever to pursue our vision of revolutionising cross-border payments and developing tokenisation solutions to solve real-world problems.”</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hong-kong-pilot-program"><strong>Hong Kong Pilot Program</strong></h2>



<p>Ripple is also actively involved in a pilot program for central bank digital currency (CBDC) with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). Hong Kong is emerging as a potential hub for virtual assets, with its own set of rules for cryptocurrency exchanges serving local residents and upcoming regulations for stablecoins. This development generates excitement within the industry, along with the crypto-specific regulations in Singapore, Japan, and the European Union.</p>



<p>With the impending license in Singapore, where much of its on-demand liquidity transactions occur, Ripple can further expand its presence in the APAC region and enhance the use of its ODL solution. The Monetary Authority of Singapore&#8217;s (MAS) focus on supporting real-world use cases rather than crypto speculation has positively influenced the company.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-regulatory-clarity-is-key"><strong>Regulatory Clarity is Key</strong></h2>



<p>As local crypto regulations are expected to evolve, Ripple will need to comply with guidelines that protect investors and build trust to drive blockchain adoption for frictionless cross-border payments, addressing the inefficiencies of legacy financial infrastructure.</p>



<p><em>“In jurisdictions like Singapore, Japan, and Hong Kong, regulators are willing to sit down and have a conversation with you. You understand exactly what’s regulated and what’s not regulated,”</em> Advani added, saying that in the United States, things are not that straightforward even with the recent ruling by Judge Torres.</p>



<p>On July 13, the court dismissed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) assertion that XRP is a security and dismissed the SEC&#8217;s complaint against Ripple, its CEO, and its chair. This historic decision affirms that XRP is not a security, a major victory for Ripple and the whole U.S. crypto market. The decision sets a precedent for other crypto assets and tokens in the United States, challenging the SEC&#8217;s approach to regulating cryptocurrencies through enforcement.</p>



<p>Ripple appears to be firmly focused on Asia, whilst the SEC has hinted that it may appeal the decision, leaving the US subject to legal ambiguity. After establishing Ripple’s APAC headquarters in Singapore in 2017, the city saw a large volume of ODL transactions and a five-fold increase in 2022. This comes in addition to a doubling of staff in Singapore, with further expansions already in the planning.</p>



<p>The MAS is now working on regulations to support investor protection, which could entail demands for client asset segregation, keeping assets in trust, and daily reconciliation, likely proving vital in fostering acceptance of blockchain technology and fostering confidence.</p>

<p>The market capitalization of the virtual currency industry has surpassed the $1 trillion mark. Still, leading U.S. banks are barred from getting any skin in the game by the country’s securities watchdog.</p>



<p>Stiff rules from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have continued to affect the ability of top banks in the country to offer crypto custody services. According to Matt Walsh, an executive at Castle Island Venture Capital, the chief stumbling block against banks offering custodial services lies with the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121).</p>



<p>Published in 2022, SAB provides that financial institutions offering digital asset custody services are required to include the asset on their balance sheets. This poses several challenges for banks looking to roll out custodial services, the most significant being an increased capital charge on the digital assets on the balance sheet.</p>



<p><em>“It is already well established that SAB 121-compliant banks cannot scale the digital asset custody offerings due to knock-on capital costs associated with putting custodied digital assets on their balance sheets,”</em> said Anchorage Digital.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Investment banking giant BNY Mellon has seen its <a href="https://zycrypto.com/americas-oldest-bank-bny-mellon-affirms-institutional-investors-absolutely-interested-in-crypto/">planned</a> digital asset custody service come to a grinding halt in the wake of the SAB 121, noting that the rule makes the service unprofitable. The bank has made several calls to the SEC to exempt bank-qualified custodians from balance sheet requirements relating to virtual currency custody.</p>



<p><em>“Having credible custodians (+self custody) are the solutions to relying on failed companies like FTX,” </em>wrote Walsh. <em>“Policymakers and regulators in the USA should be welcoming these regulated firms &#8211; not standing in their way.”</em></p>



<p>U.S. lawmakers have waded into the fray with Congressman Patrick McHenry and Senator Cynthia Lummis quizzing the SEC on the viability of the SAB 121. U.S. lawmaker Mike Flood probed the Gensler-led SEC on the SAB 121’s disparity with existing rules from the Office of The Comptroller of Currency (OCC).</p>



<p>“It is my belief that SAB 121 creates greater regulatory ambiguity, runs counter to longstanding practice regarding the custody of assets, and goes beyond the appropriate scope of a staff accounting bulletin,” wrote Flood in a letter to Gensler.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sec-says-it-is-protecting-investors-from-risk">SEC says it is protecting investors from risk</h2>



<p>According to the SEC, the rationale for the SAB 121 is to protect investors from the risks associated with digital assets. The securities watchdog warned that virtual currencies face the risks of being stolen, misplaced, or may be tied up in bankruptcy matters to the detriment of investors.</p>



<p>While several pundits have stated that the SEC’s stance is “wrong,” the agency has extended the same reason in rejecting the applications of a spot Bitcoin <a href="https://zycrypto.com/secs-approval-of-spot-bitcoin-etfs-wont-be-a-game-changer-for-crypto-industry-jpmorgan-strategists-opine/">exchange-traded fund</a> (ETF). The SEC’s crusade has seen it pitch battles against several market participants like Ripple Labs, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-action-against-coinbase-triggers-ballistic-reaction-from-crypto-community/">Coinbase</a>, and Binance, bordering on unregistered securities.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, District Judge Jed Rakoff of the Southern District of New York <a href="https://zycrypto.com/crucial-decision-by-judge-rakoff-terraform-labs-case-moves-forward-despite-ripple-ruling/">decided</a> in favour of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), enabling the action against Terraform Labs and its creator, Do Kwon, to proceed. Additionally, Judge Rakoff disagreed with Judge Torres&#8217;s distinction between institutional and public sales in SEC vs Ripple. Pertaining to the Ripple case and the SEC’s possible appeal, the SEC had asked Judge Rakoff not to agree with Judge Torrese’s decision.</p>



<p>Judge Rakoff explicitly rejected Terraform Labs&#8217; request for the SEC complaint to be dismissed, finding that the SEC had adequately established its jurisdiction and made a compelling case that TerraUSD (UST), the Anchor Protocol, and LUNA may have broken securities laws.</p>



<p>Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, was not going to comment at first but soon stepped in to explain Ripple’s view. Alderoty said: <em>“On closer read, the Terra Judge actually agrees that orange groves alone are not securities without promises to cultivate the groves and share the profits […] There needs to be an agreement between contracting parties for there to be an investment contract”</em>.</p>



<p>In isolation from other rights and commitments, he added that the judge ruled tokens are not a security in and of themselves. According to Alderoty, “The comment about the Ripple ruling is unnecessary, confusing and non-binding.”</p>



<p>James Murphy, aka MetaLawMan, was also ready to comment on Judge Rakoff’s decision. He pointed out that he had called Rakoff a “renegade judge” in a video seven months ago. According to MetaLawMan, Rakoff tends to disagree with other judges eagerly. While many have argued against the judgment, it seems James Murphy has found why Judge Rakoff ruled the way he did.</p>



<p>According to Ripple CTO David Schwartz, the decision appears to be based on the unique and special qualities of the particular scheme rather than the general traits of cryptocurrencies. Joel Katz, as known on Twitter, made the point that the justification for the decision does not apply to normal cryptocurrencies as most people understand them.</p>



<p>The SEC had charged Terraform Labs and its former CEO Do Kwon with manipulating an algorithmic stablecoin and other crypto asset securities in a multibillion-dollar fraud.</p>



<p>Popular crypto lawyer John E. Deaton said: <em>“Judge Torres or Judge Rakoff can’t ignore the issue of PRIVITY &#8211; or the lack thereof, in many instances. The bottom line is that there isn’t a single case in history where an investment contract has been found with absolutely no privity between the seller and the buyer.”</em></p>



<p>In his view, Judge Torres&#8217; decision will be validated because it aligns with the right result, and the SEC couldn&#8217;t provide any relevant cases to counter this argument. Deaton asserted that the SEC&#8217;s case lacks strong evidence to prove that XRP should be classified as an investment contract in all instances.</p>



<p>With regards to the case Ripple vs SEC, the verdict is still out if the SEC will appeal to Judge Torres&#8217;s ruling or if things are going straight to oral trial in relation to the allegation of aiding and abetting brought against Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen.</p>

<p>MicroStrategy has announced plans to sell over $700 million in shares in a move that could further expand its already impressive Bitcoin portfolio, aligning with the firm’s founder Michael Saylor&#8217;s vision of cryptocurrency as a <a href="https://twitter.com/stackhodler/status/1686633880051200000/photo/1">pivotal asset class</a>.</p>



<p>This plan was unveiled in the company’s Q2 financial results on Tuesday. The results shed light on <a href="https://zycrypto.com/microstrategy-adds-to-bitcoin-stash-now-holds-4-6-billion/">MicroStrategy&#8217;s continuous Bitcoin accumulation</a> journey and showed that the company acquired an additional 12,800 Bitcoins, amounting to $361.4 million, during the second quarter.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, Saylor disclosed that they acquired an additional 467 BTC for $14.4 million in July. This latest purchase increased its total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 152,800 Bitcoins, acquired at an average cost of $29,672 per Bitcoin. The substantial investment also represents a total expenditure of $4.53 billion, per the financial report.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-firm-to-purchase-more-bitcoin"><strong>Firm To Purchase More Bitcoin</strong></h2>



<p>The company also intended to raise $750 million by issuing up to 13,835,417 shares of class A common stock to investors at a target average price of $437.88 per share. The company further noted it intends “<em>to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of bitcoin and working capital, and, subject to market conditions, for the repurchase or repayment of our indebtedness.”</em></p>



<p>MicroStrategy&#8217;s unique role in the market is highlighted by its function as a gateway for institutional investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin. MicroStrategy has emerged as a vital alternative without an approved Bitcoin ETF in the United States. Institutional investors, constrained by portfolio regulations, view MicroStrategy as a strategic vehicle for accessing Bitcoin-related investment products.</p>



<p>This institutional demand ultimately means it could be easier for MicroStrategy to sell its shares while scooping up more coins before an ETF is approved. MicroStrategy&#8217;s Chief Financial Officer Andrew Kang underscored the company&#8217;s notable strides.</p>



<p>&#8220;<em>Our bitcoin holdings increased to 152,800 bitcoins as of July 31, 2023, with the addition of 12,333 bitcoins in the second quarter marking the most substantial quarterly surge since Q2 2021,&#8221;</em> Kang elaborated.</p>



<p>According to him, this growth trajectory was facilitated by the company&#8217;s adept utilization of its at-the-market equity program, coupled with the prudent utilization of operational cash. He further noted that these efforts unfolded against a backdrop of burgeoning institutional interest, advances in accounting transparency, and evolving regulatory clarity for Bitcoin.</p>

<p>ETF analysts at <em>Bloomberg Intelligence</em>, James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, have raised their odds for the launch of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States to 65% — a substantial jump from the 50% estimate just a couple of weeks ago, and a mere 1% a few months back.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-developments-favoring-spot-bitcoin-etf"><strong>Developments Favoring Spot Bitcoin ETF</strong></h2>



<p><em>Bloomberg </em>analysts have highlighted multiple developments around the crypto market that have compelled them to ramp up their approval odds for a Bitcoin spot ETF to 65%.</p>



<p>“The odds of a spot Bitcoin ETF launching this year are up to 65%, in our eyes, after a flurry of developments,” ETF strategists James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas noted. They previously assigned a 50% chance.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here&#39;s the race as I&#39;m watching it. We are completely guessing on the timing of the Grayscale case dates. But we think the path of least resistance is simultaneous approval for all 8 filers + Grayscale in the aftermath of the courts vacating the SEC&#39;s denial. <a href="https://t.co/Zy97iEj4Hg">pic.twitter.com/Zy97iEj4Hg</a></p>&mdash; James Seyffart (@JSeyff) <a href="https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1686709254185463808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 2, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Bringing about the more upbeat perspective is an observation that SEC Chair Gary Gensler downplayed his role within the agency during a recent interview, emphasizing that he is one of five commissioners and thus can’t singularly determine the outcome of a spot ETF approval.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The deflection seemed a change in the way he normally handles these topics,” the <em>Bloomberg </em>analysts wrote, pointing out that while there are five members, the chair has far more control and it would be unusual if the two other Democratic commissioners were to make a different decision. “We believe this may be a signal that aspects of the anti-crypto stance are becoming politically untenable for Gensler.”</p>



<p>Additionally, the strategists view the SEC’s approach to Coinbase as potentially transformative for the crypto world. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong recently <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-ceo-exposes-how-sec-directed-it-to-delist-all-cryptos-except-bitcoin/">revealed </a>that the commission previously asked the largest crypto exchange in the U.S. to delist all cryptocurrencies except Bitcoin. “This solidifies our view that if the SEC is going to bend anywhere on crypto ETFs, it will be with regard to bitcoin ETFs,” Seyffart and Balchanus stated.</p>



<p>Another positive development that the analysts further pointed to is the SEC’s suit with Grayscale. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas noted a recent case in which the SEC lost to SPIKES futures, recalling that the judge referred to the SEC order as “arbitrary and capricious”. This could bode well for Grayscale, which leveraged similar legal wording in its lawsuit against the agency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That said, Grayscale’s victory against the SEC could trigger a series of concurrent approvals for all spot Bitcoin ETF filings by the end of the fourth quarter later this year, Balchunas and Seyffart predicted.</p>



<p>While the recent developments have created an optimistic viewpoint, it’s important to remember that spot ETF approval by the SEC remains unpredictable. Seyffart explained, “BlackRock and the Coinbase SSA drastically changed any and all spot Bitcoin etf analysis. Not to mention the ripple case which is less important but still relevant. We update our views and opinions as new information comes to light. But you’re right. We don’t have a crystal ball.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-spot-bitcoin-etf-would-be-a-big-deal"><strong>Spot Bitcoin ETF Would Be A Big Deal</strong></h2>



<p>A slew of some of the most prominent traditional financial institutions, including Blackrock, Fidelity, Valkyrie, WisdomTree, and ARK Invest, is now <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-etfs-in-motion-an-analysis-of-open-spot-btc-etf-applications-in-the-market/">fighting for the title of the first to offer a spot BTC ETF</a>, which would give institutional investors direct exposure to the premier cryptocurrency rather than futures contracts.</p>



<p>Although the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has rejected every application for a spot Bitcoin ETF, many pundits think there’s a good chance that the regulator gives the nod to at least some of the applications. Most believe <a href="https://zycrypto.com/approval-incoming-sec-officially-acknowledges-blackrocks-spot-bitcoin-etf-application/">BlackRock</a>, which has rarely been denied an ETF application in the past, is more likely to be approved.</p>



<p>A US-approved Bitcoin ETF would be a wondrous thing, opine many in the cryptosphere. Were the SEC to greenlight a spot BTC ETF listing, confidence in the world’s largest and oldest cryptocurrency would soar; institutional and retail investors would flock in, and Bitcoin’s price would shoot to the moon.</p>

<p>Curve Finance founder Michael Egorov has bought himself some breathing space after some backers, including Tron founder Justin Sun, stepped in to help after the decentralized protocol suffered a $47 million hack over the weekend.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-concerns-over-egorov-s-huge-loan-position"><strong>Concerns Over Egorov’s Huge Loan Position</strong></h2>



<p>Justin Sun and others have lined up to weather a bad debt crisis that could have potentially triggered a decentralized finance (DeFi) implosion.</p>



<p>To recap: The founder of Curve Finance Michael Egorov took around $100 million in loans across various lending protocols, which were backed by 47% of the circulating supply of Curve DAO (CRV).</p>



<p>The revelation about Egorov’s teetering financial situation came as Curve Finance was reeling from a hack. The DeFi exchange suffered an exploit on Sunday due to a vulnerability related to the Vyper contract-oriented programming language. Attackers <a href="https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1685794015915229184">siphoned </a>cryptocurrencies worth $47 million, including 7.19 million CRV tokens, worth approximately $4.52 million. This put considerable downward pressure on the price of CRV, putting Egorov’s multi-million-dollar lending position at a greater risk of liquidation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">2/ On <a href="https://twitter.com/AaveAave?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AaveAave</a>, Egorov has $305m CRV backing a 63.2m USDT loan.<br><br>At a liquidation threshold of 55%, his position is eligible for liquidation at 0.3767 CRV/USDT.<br><br>This would only require a ~33% drop in CRV price for this to occur. He is also paying ~4% APY for this loan. <a href="https://t.co/fbTgsF3xEg">pic.twitter.com/fbTgsF3xEg</a></p>&mdash; Delphi Digital (@Delphi_Digital) <a href="https://twitter.com/Delphi_Digital/status/1686187960939495424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 1, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The principal value of Egorov’s loan on Aave has, however, decreased from $63.3 million to $54.1 million thanks to a slew of wealthy participants. One is Justin Sun of Tron who acquired roughly 5 million CRV from Egorov for $2.3 million in an over-the-counter deal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sun noted in a Tuesday tweet that he was “excited to assist Curve”. “As steadfast partners, we remain committed to providing support whenever needed.”</p>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1686330181609496577">Data </a>from PeckShield indicates that other participants took the chance to snap up CRV tokens for cheap through OTC transactions after Sun’s purchases. Notably, Egorov sold 3.75 million CRV to NFT owner Jeffrey Huang aka Machi Big Brother, and later 2.5 million CRV tokens to Cream Finance.</p>



<p>On-chain data tracking website Lookonchain <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1686331352483082240">notes </a>that Egorov has sold a total of 39.25 million CRV for $0.4 per token and received around 15.8 million USDT in return.</p>

<p>A former official at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has cautioned that the legal predicament for Ripple Labs is about to get worse after a recent high-stakes court decision.</p>



<p>John Reed Stark cited the recent judgment made by the Southern District of New York District Judge, Jed Rakoff, which denied Terraform Labs&#8217; motion to dismiss the securities fraud lawsuit lodged against it by the SEC.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ripple-ruling-in-trouble"><strong>Ripple Ruling In Trouble?</strong></h2>



<p>The position of Ripple’s XRP in the market as a crypto and not a security token has once again come into question following Judge Jed Rakoff’s recent ruling.</p>



<p>The ruling indicates that the SEC can proceed with its case against Terraform Labs and its founder, Do Kwon, rejecting defense arguments that the U.S. regulator lacked jurisdiction and that Terraform&#8217;s algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD did not qualify as an unregistered security.</p>



<p>Critically, Rakoff refused to extend reasoning from a July court decision in favor of Ripple to the Terraform case.</p>



<p>In the Ripple lawsuit, a different judge — Judge Analisa Torres — determined that Ripple&#8217;s XRP sales to retail investors <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">did not break federal securities laws</a> because those buyers bought on secondary markets. But Rakoff stated that this &#8220;distinction between purchasers&#8221; does not apply under the Howey test that specifies whether crypto assets are securities.</p>



<p>Former SEC Chair of the Office of Internet Enforcement, John Reed Stark, <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnReedStark/status/1686150412317888512">suggested </a>that Judge Rakoff&#8217;s decision represents a significant victory for the SEC and could have severe repercussions on the ongoing Ripple case as the agency could potentially leverage this precedent to appeal against the landmark XRP ruling.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ripple-legal-chief-federal-judge-s-ruling-has-no-impact-on-xrp"><strong>Ripple Legal Chief: Federal Judge’s Ruling Has No Impact On XRP</strong></h2>



<p>Ripple’s chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty swiftly took to X to give the XRP community the much-needed assurance following the comments by the former SEC official.</p>



<p>Alderoty <a href="https://twitter.com/s_alderoty/status/1686161058770403328">noted </a>that the Terraform Labs decision has no bearing on Ripple’s ruling that XRP is not a security. He argued that the Terra case is only just commencing and the presiding judge has to accept everything the SEC avers as true. In contrast, Ripple’s judgment came after a full factual record created over two years was presented to the court.</p>



<p>Ripple’s chief technology officer David Schwartz also shared his opinion, <a href="https://twitter.com/JoelKatz/status/1686167529025150976">positing </a>that the decision in Terraform’s case was based on the “unusual properties” of that particular case and not on how crypto assets normally work.</p>



<p>Both Alderoty and Schwartz emphasized that although Judge Rakoff rejected the Ripple verdict, the heart of the disagreement revolved around the specific facts of each lawsuit and not a sweeping judgment on crypto assets.</p>

<p>On July 31, federal judge Jed Rakoff denied Terraform Labs&#8217; motion to dismiss the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit against their company and founder, Do Kwon. He refused to apply the logic from the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-verdict-ripple-chief-legal-officer-confident-in-another-win-should-sec-choose-to-appeal/">recent ruling in favor of Ripple Labs</a>, which determined that Ripple&#8217;s XRP sales did not violate federal securities laws because the sales were made to institutional investors and not to the general public.</p>



<p>The judge ruled that, according to the Howey legal test, it doesn&#8217;t matter how Terraform Labs initially sold their UST and LUNA cryptocurrencies (whether to wholesale or retail investors, in primary or secondary markets). What matters is whether those sales constituted the offering of securities that should have been properly registered with the SEC under U.S. securities laws.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that under the Howey test, if a cryptocurrency involves investing money in a common enterprise with the expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others, it is considered a security.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-judge-rakoff-rejected-terraform-labs-arguments-against-the-sec">Judge Rakoff rejected Terraform Labs&#8217; arguments against the SEC</h2>



<p>The judge dismissed&nbsp; Terraform Labs&#8217; claim that the SEC needed explicit congressional authorization to regulate stablecoins. He also considered that the SEC provided enough evidence that the company had allegedly fabricated adoption data of their cryptocurrencies to fraudulently promote them.</p>



<p>Rakoff stated that although the cryptocurrency industry holds some global significance, it is still &#8220;far from being a &#8216;part of the U.S. economy&#8217; with &#8216;substantial economic and political importance'&#8221;.</p>



<p>On February 16, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Terraform Labs and its founder, Do Kwon, for alleged securities fraud. The SEC accused Terraform of selling the stablecoin TerraUSD without properly registering it as a security and misleadingly promoting it to the public.</p>



<p>Additionally, they accused Do Kwon, who is currently out on a $430,000 bond, of allegedly orchestrating a billion-dollar fraud through the sale of TerraClassicUSD (USTC) and its connected cryptocurrency, Terra Luna Classic (LUNC), formerly known as Terra (LUNA) and TerraUSD (UST).</p>



<p>The SEC seeks restitution of illegally obtained investor funds from Terraform Labs and the imposition of civil penalties.</p>



<p>Although Judge Rakoff&#8217;s decision might be seen as a significant victory for the SEC in their campaign against the cryptocurrency industry, the lawsuit could still be dismissed on appeal or if a mutual agreement is reached.</p>



<p>Therefore, it is still too early for the thousands or millions of investors who lost their money due to the colossal fall of Terra to claim victory and rest easy. While regulators are assisting in recovering the lost funds, so far that money remains missing, and it is very difficult for it to be fully recovered. The complex legal and financial situation surrounding the collapse of Terra means it could take years to completely resolve it.</p>
