Movement On the Chain
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Aptos blockchain has been generating significant attention in the crypto space, due to its innovative architecture and strong development team. Aptos has already secured substantial funding from notable investors, formed a partnership with Google Cloud, and attracted interest from numerous developers and projects.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">As such, Aptos' blockchain comes in as a new solution aimed at addressing the challenges faced by current blockchain infrastructures such as outages, high costs, low throughput limits, and security concerns. Developed by a global team of over 350 developers, Aptos incorporates innovative features in consensus, smart contract design, system security, performance, and decentralization. Its design principles prioritize scalability, safety, reliability, and upgradeability.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Aptos has a feature set that includes the integration of the Move language for secure transaction execution, a data model that enables flexible key management and hybrid custodial options, a pipelined and modular approach for transaction processing, support for atomic transactions without upfront knowledge of data access, a modular architecture that enables frequent upgrades and on-chain change management, as well as open experimentation with initiatives to scale from individual validator performance through internal and homogeneous state sharding.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Aptos ecosystem has been growing rapidly, with projects such as Blocto, Solrise, Pontem Network, Laminar, Econia, Empo, Hanson, and Liquidswap already developing on the platform.</p>
