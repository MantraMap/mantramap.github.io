<li>Ripple price is facing resistance near the $0.520 level against the US dollar.</li>
<li>The price is now trading above $0.52 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $0.4910 on the 4-hour chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken).</li>
<li>The pair could continue to move down below the $0.4720 support zone.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Ripple price is struggling below $0.520 against the US Dollar, unlike <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-bulls-aim-fresh-uptrend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a>. XRP price must stay above the $0.472 support to remain in a bullish zone.</em></p>
<h2>Ripple Price Analysis</h2>
<p>After struggling to stay above $0.525, Ripple price started a fresh decline against the US Dollar. The XRP/USD pair gained bearish momentum below the 0.515 support zone.</p>
<p>The bears were able to push the price below the $0.50 support. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $0.4910 on the 4-hour chart of the XRP/USD pair. There was a move below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.4550 swing low to the $0.5263 high.</p>
<p>XRP is now trading above $0.52 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ripple-price-analysis-bulls-aim-fresh-rally-to-0-55/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. It is now testing the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.4550 swing low to the $0.5263 high.</p>
<p>Initial support on the downside is near the $0.4820 level. The next major support is near the $0.4715 level, below which the price could accelerate lower toward the $0.4550 support. Any more losses could lead the price toward the $0.432 level.</p>
<p>On the upside, the price is facing resistance near $0.490 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours). The next major resistance is near the $0.5020 level.</p>
<p>A clear move above the $0.5020 resistance zone might start a steady increase. In the stated case, the price could even surpass the $0.5150 resistance and a connecting bearish trend line. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.540 resistance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ron DeSantis – the republican governor of Florida – has <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/florida-governor-ron-desantis-bans-193615323.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">signed a new bill into</a> law preventing the issuance and use of centralized bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in his state.</p>
<h2>Ron DeSantis Says &#8220;No&#8221; to CBDCs</h2>
<p>Just over a week ago, DeSantis <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/florida-governor-ron-desantis-defends-crypto-and-bashes-the-idea-of-cbdcs/" data-wpel-link="internal">issued his thoughts on</a> CBDCs and made his dislike of these assets clear. He stated in a press conference:</p>
<blockquote><p>The danger of the digital currency is that they want to make that the sole currency. They want to put everything in a central bank digital currency. I think that that’s fundamentally wrong, so we’re recognizing the dangers with this agenda.</p></blockquote>
<p>DeSantis said he was concerned about CBDCs given they would be issued by standard institutions, thus allowing monetary executives and ultimately government figures to spy and look in on what people were doing with their money and how they were spending their hard-earned dollars. DeSantis said Joe Biden and the rest of the democrats are working hard to ensure crypto doesn’t have a future in America given it’s not an industry they can control. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>They don’t like crypto because they can’t control crypto. They want to get rid of crypto, which my view is if you want to invest in crypto, it’s up to you. You can do it. You can make those decisions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, DeSantis has put his words into action and signed a new bill ensuring that CBDCs cannot be issued in the state of Florida, nor can they be utilized by residents of the region. He commented that he believes all Floridians have a right to privacy and autonomy, something central bank digital currencies will eventually get in the way of. He commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>Anyone with their eyes open could see the danger this type of an arrangement would mean for Americans who want to exercise their financial independence and would like to be able to conduct business without having the government know every single transaction they&#8217;re making in real time.</p></blockquote>
<p>One can easily see DeSantis has a point. Crypto was initially designed to give people full independence and control over their finances. The reason crypto is decentralized is because it was built to ensure no middlemen, prying eyes, or third parties could enter the arena and tell users what they could and could not do.</p>
<h2>No Prying Allowed!</h2>
<p>Central bank digital currencies go against this very notion in that they take on a form similar with USD or other forms of fiat currencies. They will be issued by banks, meaning the same companies that shut certain people out or charge people for specific services will be able to do so again, only this time, in a whole new industry.</p>
<p>The idea is to have limited government control and invoke more strength in everyday people.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>El Salvador has long been a bitcoin advocate. The currency is a national form of payment within its borders, but while the president of the nation may be pleased about the prospects, there are many other leaders in the <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/top-senators-take-aim-at-el-salvador-bitcoin-adoption-over-national-security-risks/ar-AA1b74L0" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">United States and other</a> countries that think the current situation is a bad one.</p>
<h2>El Salvador and Bitcoin Are Getting on the U.S.&#8217;s Bad Side</h2>
<p>Recently, a handful of senators and lawmakers in the U.S. – including Bob Menendez of New Jersey (a democrat) and Jim Risch of Idaho (a republican) – criticized El Salvador for walking what they referred to as a thin monetary path, and they issued a new form of legislation designed to get the country to fess up and account for its actions.</p>
<p>Known as the Accountability for Cryptocurrency in El Salvador Act, the bill is designed to get El Salvador to produce a new report that talks about how it’s using crypto and what it’s doing to ensure users are safe.</p>
<p>The document the nation is required to produce should also detail all the security risks of having bitcoin as legal tender. It should also talk about economic stability and democratic governance surrounding bitcoin use and issuance. In an interview, Risch said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Using cryptocurrency as legal tender could weaken economic and financial stability and empower malign actors. Given U.S. interest on prosperity and transparency in Central America, we must seek greater clarity on how the adoption of bitcoin as legal tender may impact El Salvador’s financial and economic stability, as well as El Salvador’s capacity to effectively combat money laundering and illicit finances.</p></blockquote>
<p>El Salvador has been running on the bitcoin hamster wheel for about two years. The nation was the first in the world to declare bitcoin legal tender, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-fully-legal-in-el-salvador-beginning-september-7/" data-wpel-link="internal">having done so in September</a> of 2021. The nation did all it could to ensure bitcoin could be utilized for payments so that U.S. dollar use could ease down and potentially be done away with for good.</p>
<p>But while things may have looked good on paper at first, the maneuver has run into some problems. The country has run up quite a bit of <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/el-salvador-is-in-debt-because-of-btc-its-turning-to-china-for-help/" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin-related debt over the</a> past year thanks to the crypto winter of 2022 that caused the world’s number one digital currency  by market cap to lose more than 70 percent of its value. Several residents, fearing the criminality that is often tied to bitcoin use, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/el-salvador-residents-protest-forced-btc-usage/" data-wpel-link="internal">have also protested</a> in the streets of the nation’s capital.</p>
<h2>Dismissing the Worries</h2>
<p>Bukele has often pushed aside the concerns of lawmakers in the U.S. that surround his country’s bitcoin journey. On Twitter in 2022, he wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Never in my wildest dreams would I have thought that the US government would be afraid of what we are doing here. The US government DOES NOT stand for freedom.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a recent interview, Justin Sun – the crypto executive behind popular digital asset firm <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/tron/" data-wpel-link="internal">Tron</a> – said he’s <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/exclusive-tron-s-justin-sun-believes-blockchain-based-financial-services-can-reduce-global-poverty/ar-AA1baQIF" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">very confident blockchain</a> technology can ensure global poverty is relieved in the coming years.</p>
<h2>Justin Sun on the Strength of Blockchain</h2>
<p>In the interview, Sun commented that blockchain will eventually be needed by mankind the way standard banks are, and that its financial protocols will play a big role in keeping global poverty to a minimum. Sun said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think people in the United States don&#8217;t really know that for most of the world, it is very hard to get access to U.S. dollars. Ninety percent of people outside the U.S. don&#8217;t have a U.S. bank account. USDT on Tron provides them with an important opportunity to get access to U.S. dollars. USDT can become an alternative for them to store value and make payments.</p></blockquote>
<p>He said blockchain doesn’t cut people out the way standard banks do. Blockchain doesn’t care about your credit history or what kind of jobs you’ve had in the past. All you need is an internet connection to transact, and the technology does the rest. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think a big contributor to poverty is a lack of financial services. For people in parts of Africa, one of the biggest pain points is there is no easy way for people to store value. They can&#8217;t get access to a bank account&#8230; Blockchain provides a great solution with basically zero cost[s]. They can use this account to receive money and store value.</p></blockquote>
<p>He says countries like the U.S. have always taken its easy access to standard financial services for granted, and he believes blockchain will play a huge part in bringing other countries to the monetary pulpit. He mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>I believe blockchain will become one of the most important parts of national infrastructure, like gas or water. Everybody can use it every day without a very big cost.</p></blockquote>
<p>He also mentioned stable coins are very important in that they can assist those who cannot gain access to cash or fiat currencies:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have always believed stablecoins have the biggest use case outside of the US.</p></blockquote>
<h2>His Company&#8217;s Getting Bigger</h2>
<p>He said that assets like Tron are growing quite rapidly, and he thinks his network will do great things for the financial world as people can open accounts on the platform for free:</p>
<blockquote><p>Currently, our transaction volume is about $14 billion per day. Since the inception of the network, we have made several trillion dollars’ worth of transactions. We believe it&#8217;s going to continue to grow, since more and more people have this kind of demand, especially outside of the United States. We will continue to work to drive the usage and to provide the most important infrastructure globally.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin hit its lowest levels since March during the <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/bitcoin-falls-to-lowest-level-since-march-as-thin-liquidity-regulatory-pressure-hits-crypto-markets/ar-AA1b5ZrX" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">midway point of May</a>, and analysts are trying hard to figure out why.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin and Last Month Didn&#8217;t Go Well Together</h2>
<p>In many ways, the arena was set for bitcoin to have an explosive month. While the currency was still miles above the position it stood at during 2022 – as we <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-is-still-65-higher-than-where-it-was-last-year/" data-wpel-link="internal">reported earlier today</a> – the currency experienced a nasty little dip that saw it fall into the mid-$26K range, an area it hadn’t seen in a while.</p>
<p>Prior to this fall, banks were <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/analysts-provide-their-thoughts-on-latest-bitcoin-rally/" data-wpel-link="internal">failing left and right</a>, which ultimately should have paved the way for bitcoin. The currency tends to do quite well when the standard financial arena is stumbling, so what could have happened? In addition, the Fed had hinted that rate hikes were going to slow down if they didn’t come to a full halt. The situation is a baffling one, and it’s left analysts in a strange daze.</p>
<p>Clara Medalie – director of research at Kaiko – said the price dips exhibited by bitcoin had more to do with a “notable drop in market depth” for the world’s number one digital currency. There were also issues arising from both Jane Street and Jump Crypto, two of the biggest crypto market makers. Both announced they were going to be stepping back from crypto trading in regions like the U.S. given the unstable nature of regulation and agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<p>Naturally, such news wouldn’t be taken well by the industry. She explained in a recent interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>While it is yet unclear the catalyst for today&#8217;s sharp drop, the volatility is to be expected given the current state of liquidity, especially after larger market makers Jane Street and Jump Crypto revealed they were winding down their crypto exposure.</p></blockquote>
<p>The lack of clear regulation has caused a wide scope of issues in both the U.S. and abroad. Coinbase – one of the world’s largest and most popular digital currency trading platforms – was recently issued a Wells notice from the SEC, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-receives-wells-notice-from-the-sec/" data-wpel-link="internal">informing it that it was likely</a> to face financial charges in the coming future.</p>
<p>Executives took serious issue with the notice, claiming they had met with representatives of the SEC at least 30 times over a nine-year period to ensure the company and all its operations were compliant. Brian Armstrong – the CEO of the exchange – has stated that he believes Coinbase is going to be involved in a very lengthy battle with the agency.</p>
<h2>So Many Issues at Once</h2>
<p>Antoni Trenchev -co-founder of Nexo – said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin&#8217;s attempts to break through $30,000 have come undone amidst a triple whammy of congestion issues on the blockchain, liquidity constraints caused by the scaling back of top market makers Jane Street and Jump Crypto, and ever-circling regulators.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It looks like crypto is on its way to the Hundred Acre Wood – the legendary home of famed literary character Winnie the Pooh. A <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/new-cryptocurrency-pooh-is-bringing-back-nostalgia-for-a-beloved-character-while-helping-do-good-for-the-environment-2023-05-10" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">new meme currency</a> called $POOH, inspired by the heavyset, honey-loving bear is the latest addition to the crypto industry, and it’s got noble intent behind it as well.</p>
<h2>$POOH Wants to Help Bees</h2>
<p>As the star of countless movies and television programs, Winnie the Pooh has made his way into the hearts of both children and adults. He eventually walked into the Disney studio and became one of the company’s most beloved characters. Many of us still remember his trademark phrase of “Oh, bother!” when something was tough or didn’t quite go as expected.</p>
<p>With so many outlets featuring the “silly old bear,” it seems only natural that the crypto arena would eventually fall victim to his cute and loveable antics. The new $POOH token was built to ensure bees have a steady future in the world given how thin their numbers have become over the past few years. While it’s unclear if this is due to pesticide use, climate change, or some other anomaly, one thing is for certain: bee populations <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/04/01/825305756/honeybees-need-your-help-honey" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">everywhere are suffering</a>.</p>
<p>If bees go out, the world is in a rough spot. Bees do a lot of good for the planet through their pollination efforts, and without them, Mother Earth is going to have a tough time surviving. This is where $POOH comes in. Executives behind the asset want it to be the most held meme token. They also want it to support all kinds of projects out there working towards bee conservation.</p>
<p>An anonymous developer for the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/token/" data-wpel-link="internal">token</a> explained in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>While we are a self-owned community that is collecting all the honey, ultimately, we care about the bees and want to make an impact. We wanted to create a cryptocurrency that not only brings joy and entertainment to people, but also has a meaningful impact on the environment. The decline of bee populations is a significant threat to the environment, and we&#8217;re committed to doing our part to help save the bees by contributing money to this important cause.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Bringing a Loveable Character to Crypto</h2>
<p>He continued with:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our meme coin ecosystem will help support healthier bees through a range of conservation activities that will help protect food security for future generations. Also, we want to make it clear that $POOH is not associated with any company, and the token only shows love to a much beloved character… It&#8217;s time for the most recognizable bear in the world to claim his rightful position on the charts at the start of a life-changing bull market. $POOH launched stealthily with no presale, zero taxes, 95 percent LP burnt, and contract renounced. $POOH is for the people forever.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The price of bitcoin fell somewhat in mid-May, <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/bitcoin-has-climbed-65-this-year-despite-crypto-woes-experts-explain-why/ar-AA1b5IvN" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">causing a bit of a scare amongst</a> digital currency investors. However, analysts are telling them not to worry so much given the world’s number one digital asset by market cap is still about 65 percent higher than where it was at the end of last year.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin&#8230; It&#8217;s Still in a Solid Place</h2>
<p>During the month of May, bitcoin – after <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-rose-to-30k-in-mid-april-analysts-discuss-why/" data-wpel-link="internal">trading at $30K</a>, a ten-month high – fell into the high $26,000 range. Analysts feel that much of the fear that surrounded the dip was premature in that bitcoin was still in a solid position compared with where it was in 2022, arguably the worst period on record for the currency and for crypto in general.</p>
<p>During that time, bitcoin fell by more than 70 percent from the all-time high it achieved in November of 2021. That was when it was trading for about $68,000 per unit. However, 12 months later, the currency had fallen into the mid-$16,000 range. It was a sad and ugly sight to see.</p>
<p>However, if this wasn’t bad enough, several other assets chose to follow in bitcoin’s footsteps and lost mountains of value as well. This ultimately contributed to the crypto arena losing more than $2 trillion in overall valuation over the course of one year, and it’s taken quite a bit of energy to bring these assets back up to their present levels.</p>
<p>Discussing the circumstances surrounding bitcoin and its previous rise and subsequent falls, James Butterfill – head of research at digital currency management firm Coin Shares – stated that the Fed and its endless array of rate hikes are largely to blame for all the madness seen over the previous 12 months. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>There had been a big bubble. The bubble was pricked by the Fed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, Callie Cox – an analyst at crypto firm e-Toro – also threw her two cents in. Her opinion is unique in that she feels the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/" data-wpel-link="internal">collapse of FTX</a>, while contributing to short-term disdain and troubles for bitcoin, made people flock to it more in the long run.</p>
<p>They were concerned about the lesser performances of smaller assets following the exchange’s death, and they all turned to tokens like BTC and ETH – more mainstream and legitimate in many eyes – as a means of ensuring their crypto portfolios could remain steady. She says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin has been the beneficiary of a flight to quality within the crypto industry. This is the crypto name that my mom and your family probably know.</p></blockquote>
<h2>So Much Junk Out There!</h2>
<p>Butterfull was quick to agree, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>People are becoming a lot more discerning. There are 50,000 crypto coins out there and a lot of them are rubbish… Economic data continues to deteriorate. In that environment, bitcoin would be volatile and perform quite well.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Montenegro court has accepted a bail <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2023-05-12/montenegro-court-agrees-to-release-founder-of-cryptocurrency-firm-terraform-labs-on-bail" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">payment on behalf</a> of Do Kwon, the disgraced crypto executive behind fallen digital currency firm Terraform Labs. The company established the crumbled algorithmic stable currency known as Terra USD.</p>
<h2>Do Kwon is Out on Bail</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Kwon – along with another detained South Korean man believed to have been involved in the project – is out of prison after presenting $435,000 to court officials to ensure he would not have to await his upcoming trial behind bars. He is now confined to a nearby apartment, and he and his associate are not allowed to leave the domicile until the trial has been concluded.</p>
<p>The court has put out the following statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>They promised&#8230; they will not hide until the end of the criminal procedures, that they will regularly answer court summons, and that they will be available [at] the address submitted by their attorney. If the defendants run away or violate the surveillance measure, the bail will fall through and will be added to the special budget for court work.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kwon was a fugitive for some time <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/crypto-executive-do-kwon-arrested-in-montenegro/" data-wpel-link="internal">after his company</a> completely collapsed and (figuratively) burnt to the ground. Organizations such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged him with fraud, and it wasn’t long before his own country of South Korea issued a warrant for his arrest.</p>
<p>Kwon remained active on social media for a while after the warrant was issued. He said he was not on the run, and that he was willing to cooperate with police authorities in any way possible. He also said he wasn’t going anywhere, and that he was busily coding in his living room, thus practically inviting police to come knock on his door and question him in his company’s failings.</p>
<p>However, the social media activity didn’t last forever, and it wasn’t long before Kwon shut his accounts down and proceeded to make his way across the globe allegedly to hide himself from those who would see him behind bars. His plight didn’t last long, however, as it was in the nation of Montenegro (where he possessed multiple fake passports) that he was finally caught.</p>
<h2>A Rug Pull, Perhaps?</h2>
<p>At the time of his detainment, authorities in that nation put out the following statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Montenegrin police have detained a person suspected of being one of the world’s most wanted fugitives, South Korean citizen Do Kwon, co-founder and CEO of Singapore-based Terraform Labs. The former ‘cryptocurrency king’, who is behind losses of more than 40 billion dollars, was detained at the Podgorica airport with falsified documents, and South Korea, the USA, and Singapore are demanding [his extradition].</p></blockquote>
<p>Kwon has been accused of initiating a rug pull given he and his fellow executives switched several of their Terra assets out for BTC prior to the collapse.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ohio law enforcement agencies are telling residents about <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/ohio-agencies-warn-of-cryptocurrency-scams-targeting-older-ohioans/ar-AA19AS7D" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">several growing crypto</a> scams in the area that are targeting members of the elderly community.</p>
<h2>Ohio Is a Center of Crypto Fraud</h2>
<p>There are many <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/scams/" data-wpel-link="internal">crypto scams</a> out there that seek to take advantage of older generations given they don’t always understand how computers or modern technology work. For this reason, they’re less likely to question things that might appear suspicious to others. Many of them also have heavy retirements saved up that make them “richer” than other individuals in scammers eyes.</p>
<p>The Ohio Narcotics Intelligence Center (ONIC) is claiming that it became aware of these scams against elderly citizens through a string of recent drug-related investigations. Andy Wilson – director of the Ohio Department of Public Safety – explained in a recent statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Recently, ONIC has assisted several local law enforcement agencies with their cryptocurrency scam investigations. Our agencies issued this bulletin to raise awareness about the dangers of these new scams targeting older Ohioans. We are working closely together to make resources available for consumers who believe they have been a target.</p></blockquote>
<p>He further mentioned that several of the scammers are in regular contact with their victims as a means of guiding them through the process of sending funds via bitcoin ATMs and similar tools. It’s often very difficult to track funds that are delivered this way, and about 90 percent of the time, once crypto is gone, it’s gone for good.</p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission is now warning residents of Ohio – and the general U.S. population – about the growing number of scams and telling them about things to watch out for. For example, it said no legitimate business will ever ask that you forward crypto funds, as many of these companies are likely to operate through cash and even then, they’ll only ask you for payments if transactions occurred and you’ve bought products or services.</p>
<p>In addition, meeting people on dating sites or applications that request to show you how to invest in digital currency sites usually means they’re not who they say they are, and they’re looking to carry out theft.</p>
<p>Also, no business will engage in texting, emailing, or messaging on social media to try and get you to part with money, nor will they ever ask that you purchase anything with digital assets. Lastly, if you do wind up getting a social media message, text, or email from an entity you don’t recognize, and it contains a link of some sort, it’s best to avoid clicking on it.</p>
<h2>Going After Old People Ain&#8217;t Cool</h2>
<p>Ohio Department of Aging Director Ursel J. McElroy said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite the fact that older adults are more likely to report suspected fraud than younger adults, scammers are finding new and sophisticated ways to deceive people, like these emerging cryptocurrency scams.</p></blockquote>
