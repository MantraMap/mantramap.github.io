										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Malicious actors drained $313 million from decentralized finance (DeFi) in the second quarter of 2023, according to a report by security firm CertiK.</em></li>



<li><em>The report highlights a surge in exit scams, commonly known as &#8220;rug pulls,&#8221; doubling the losses to investors.</em></li>



<li><em>However, the decline in flash loan and oracle manipulation exploits suggests that the DeFi industry is making progress in protecting investors and their assets.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Malicious actors drained $313M from DeFi in Q2 2023; CertiK report shows decline in some attacks, but surge in exit scams.</strong></h5>



<p>According to a recent report by security firm CertiK, malicious actors drained $313 million from decentralized finance (DeFi) in the second quarter of 2023. While this figure is similar to the losses incurred in the previous quarter, it reflects a 58% decline from the massive $745 million lost in the same period last year. The CertiK report also revealed a surge in exit scams, commonly known as &#8220;rug pulls,&#8221; doubling the losses to investors. However, other types of attacks, such as flash loan and oracle manipulation exploits, experienced a decline.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-307.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="688" height="609" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-307.png" alt="Surge In DeFi Exit Scams: CertiK Report Reveals Losses Of $313 Million In Q2 2023" class="wp-image-200344" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-307.png 688w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-307-300x266.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 688px) 100vw, 688px" title="Surge In DeFi Exit Scams: CertiK Report Reveals Losses Of $313 Million In Q2 2023 4"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>DeFi protocols have implemented stronger security measures, such as decentralized oracles and built-in protections, to mitigate flash loan and oracle exploits, potentially decreasing the success rate of these attacks. As these attacks become harder to succeed at, digital thugs turn to other strategies, such as rug pulls. Different blockchains experienced varying degrees of security incidents, with the BNB Chain suffering the most losses.</p>



<p>It is important to note that CertiK&#8217;s report sheds light on 212 distinct security incidents identified in the second quarter of 2023, with an average loss of about $1.5 million per incident. April saw 75 incidents resulting in a total loss of approximately $103.8 million. May saw 63 incidents and losses of around $74.6 million, while June had 74 incidents with losses amounting to approximately $135.2 million.</p>



<p>While rug pulls led to a loss of about $70 million for unsuspecting investors, a dramatic jump from the $31 million lost through rug pulls in the first quarter, security researchers noted a decline in flash loan and oracle manipulation exploits. CertiK’s report finds that attackers only managed to net about $24 million through 54 such attacks in the second quarter, a notable drop from the previous quarter’s 52 oracle manipulation attacks, which amounted to $222 million.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Coinbase&#8217;s stock fell 69% since initiation, 11 analysts recommend buying while 13 rate a hold. Regulatory pressures and lack of clarity pose revenue challenges.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-306.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-306.png" alt="Regulatory Pressures Plague Coinbase, Causing Uncertainty And Revenue Challenges" class="wp-image-200339" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-306.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-306-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-306-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-306-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Regulatory Pressures Plague Coinbase, Causing Uncertainty And Revenue Challenges 5"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Coinbase has been facing regulatory pressures that have resulted in its shares dropping. The Securities and Exchange Commission has accused the company of illegally operating an unregistered securities exchange, and this has created a lot of uncertainty around the company&#8217;s future. </p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-05/coinbase-downgraded-as-analyst-says-crypto-limbo-dims-revenue-outlook?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=crypto&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-05/coinbase-downgraded-as-analyst-says-crypto-limbo-dims-revenue-outlook?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=crypto&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter#xj4y7vzkg" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a>, Piper Sandler analyst Patrick Moley has downgraded his recommendation on the company to neutral from overweight. He believes that it is too difficult to forecast how much revenue the company could earn given the impending courtroom tussle with the SEC and the continued lack of clarity around cryptocurrency regulation in the US.</p>



<p>Berenberg, a German investment bank, has also warned that the stock&#8217;s rally in June could be short-lived. Investors followed BlackRock Inc.&#8217;s application for a spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, naming Coinbase as a custodian. The lack of regulatory clarity around cryptocurrency could make it difficult for Coinbase to meet its revenue projections. Moley expects second-quarter trading volumes and monthly transacting user totals to be the lowest in over two years.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-305.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="439" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-305-1024x439.png" alt="Regulatory Pressures Plague Coinbase, Causing Uncertainty And Revenue Challenges" class="wp-image-200338" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-305-1024x439.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-305-300x129.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-305-768x330.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-305-750x322.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-305-1140x489.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-305.png 1235w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Regulatory Pressures Plague Coinbase, Causing Uncertainty And Revenue Challenges 6"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Source: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/7W3S722o/?symbol=NASDAQ%3ACOIN" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/7W3S722o/?symbol=NASDAQ%3ACOIN" rel="noreferrer noopener">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Despite the regulatory pressures, Coinbase&#8217;s shares have soared 55% since June 6, when the SEC accused the company of illegally operating an unregistered securities exchange. Piper Sandler has held an overweight rating on the exchange since May 2021, a month after the company went public. Moley sees Coinbase as positioned to be a &#8220;major player&#8221; in the crypto space once regulatory clarity is achieved, but he would &#8220;like to see more progress on the regulatory front and a convincing turnaround in the underlying fundamentals&#8221; before turning more positive.</p>



<p>Coinbase&#8217;s stock had fallen 69% since the initiation as of the close on Monday. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-05/coinbase-downgraded-as-analyst-says-crypto-limbo-dims-revenue-outlook?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=crypto&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-05/coinbase-downgraded-as-analyst-says-crypto-limbo-dims-revenue-outlook?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=crypto&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter#xj4y7vzkg" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg </a>reported that 11 recommend buying Coinbase stock while 13 rate it a hold and eight say sell. The lack of regulatory clarity around cryptocurrency could make it difficult for Coinbase to meet its revenue projections. </p>

<p>The company reported mining 225 Bitcoin in June, increasing total Bitcoin output for the second quarter of 2023 to over 626 Bitcoin. This is a 43% increase over Bitcoin prizes awarded in the fourth quarter of 2022.</p>



<p>Despite significant improvements in the Bitcoin network hash rate over the same time, Stronghold achieved 1% sequential growth vs the first quarter of 2023. This indicates the company&#8217;s capacity to sustain consistent mining performance while navigating changing market circumstances efficiently.</p>



<p>Stronghold acquired and activated 2,000 Avalon 1346 Bitcoin mining machines in June in accordance with its growth objectives. These mining equipment were part of the Canaan Bitcoin Mining Agreement, which the company previously revealed. Stronghold continues to aggressively seek more possibilities to fill its remaining data center slots, which total more than 1 EH/s (exahashes per second). By the end of the third quarter of 2023, the company intends to utilize its current 4 EH/s data center capacity.</p>

<p>Moreover, <a href="https://coincu.com/177264-stronghold-bitcoin-mining-revenue-35/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stronghold</a> is looking at possibilities for deploying its extra 25 MW of end-to-end data center equipment, which includes 20 unique StrongBox containers that are presently in inventory. The selection of a third site for this deployment is likely to be determined in the third quarter of 2023.</p>



<p>Stronghold Digital Mining differentiates itself with its emphasis on ecologically friendly processes. The company&#8217;s mining activities are housed in its fully owned Scrubgrass and Panther Creek plants in Pennsylvania, which are low-cost and ecologically beneficial coal waste power production facilities.</p>

<p>Stronghold underlines the necessity of ethical and sustainable operations within the sector since crypto market regulation is still waiting. The company thinks that uncontrolled trading in crypto assets might damage faith in the financial system and advocates for the careful legitimization of such trade.</p>



<p>Stronghold Digital Mining&#8217;s exceptional growth in Bitcoin mining and dedication to environmentally sustainable operations place it as an industry leader. The company intends to benefit from the rising demand for cryptocurrencies while maintaining long-term financial stability, with a strategic emphasis on growth and ethical operations.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Danish FSA has ruled that Saxo Bank's proprietary cryptocurrency transactions are not within the legal business scope of financial institutions.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The Danish Financial Supervisory Authority has ruled that Saxo Bank&#8217;s proprietary cryptocurrency transactions are not within the legal business scope of financial institutions.</em></li>



<li><em>Unregulated cryptocurrency trading can create distrust in the financial system, and the authority believes there is no justification for legitimizing such trading.</em></li>



<li><em>Saxo Bank has been ordered to dispose of its crypto holdings, and new regulations for crypto markets will be implemented by the end of 2024.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-05/danish-regulator-orders-saxo-bank-to-stop-own-trading-in-crypto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a></em>, the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority decided that Saxo Bank&#8217;s crypto asset transactions for its own account did not fall within the legal business scope of financial institutions, and unregulated encrypted asset transactions may cause distrust in the financial system, and the Danish Financial Services Authority believes that legalizing crypto asset trading is unnecessary.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-297.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-297-1024x768.png" alt="Saxo Bank Asked To Stop Crypto-Related Activities By Danish Regulator" class="wp-image-200322" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-297-1024x768.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-297-300x225.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-297-768x576.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-297-750x563.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-297-1140x855.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-297.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Saxo Bank Asked To Stop Crypto-Related Activities By Danish Regulator 10"></a></figure></div>


<p>As a result, this activity is not acceptable as an auxiliary banking company for financial stability considerations (see section 24 of the Financial Services Act). Moreover, Saxo Bank maintains a portfolio of cryptoassets as a hedging mechanism to counter the market risk linked with the bank&#8217;s cryptoasset products. Saxo Bank was obliged to sell its own crypto assets on this grounds.</p>

<p>The new laws governing crypto markets will not go into effect until the end of 2024, thus, the sector will remain uncontrolled for the time being, according to the FSA.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Unregulated trading in cryptoassets can create distrust in the financial system, and the Danish FSA believes it would be unfounded to legitimize trading in cryptoassets,” the agency stated.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Saxo Bank provides its clients with the ability to trade a variety of crypto asset products through the bank&#8217;s platform. On the one hand, there are ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) and ETNs (Exchange Traded Notes) that track the growth of cryptoassets, while on the other, it is possible to bet on cryptoassets, which are advertised as &#8220;cryptocurrency cross.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Copenhagen-based bank is under increased regulatory scrutiny after being designated as a systemically significant financial institution for the first time last month.</p>



<p>The legislation on cryptoasset markets (MiCA) will not be fully implemented until December 30, 2024. Unregulated trade in crypto-assets might cause mistrust in the financial system, and the Danish FSA believes that legitimizing trading in crypto-assets would be unwarranted. As a result, the activity is deemed unsuitable for supplementary bank operations on grounds of financial stability.</p>

<p>Anchorage Digital, a San Francisco-based crypto bank, has seen a significant increase in business this year due to a growing demand for safer custody of assets. The company reported an 80% jump in assets under custody in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. </p>



<p>Anchorage Digital has become the first federally chartered crypto bank and received approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to act as a custodian for other institutions that want to offer crypto. The company is in talks to offer custody to EDX Markets, a newly launched crypto exchange backed by firms such as Citadel Securities, Fidelity Digital Assets, and Charles Schwab Corp.</p>



<p>Anchorage Digital&#8217;s core business remains providing custodial services to institutions, and it has expanded into trading, lending, and decentralized finance tools as more financial institutions push into the crypto space. The company has also been affected by the changes in the industry, having announced layoffs of 20% of its staff in March to refocus the business. However, the company is not planning any more job cuts at this time.</p>



<p>The shift from retail to institutional players in the digital assets market has also created opportunities for startup custodians and technology providers. BlackRock Inc., the world&#8217;s largest asset manager, filed for a US spot Bitcoin ETF, and other firms, including Fidelity, Invesco Ltd., and WisdomTree, followed suit.</p>



<p>Anchorage Digital raised $350 million at a more than $3 billion valuation from investors led by private equity firm KKR &amp; Co. in 2021. The company is expanding its presence in Portugal, where co-founder and president Diogo Monica lived until his early twenties and where the company has almost 100 employees. Monica plans to relocate to Lisbon to oversee Anchorage&#8217;s overseas expansion plans personally.</p>

<p>The compensation scheme is separated into three categories based on the number of user losses, with Orbiter Finance entirely compensating losses of $1,000 or less. Users may claim compensation beginning at 7:30 UTC on July 5, with a 48-hour application window.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Regarding the losses suffered by community users due to the Discord attack, we are committed to providing compensation,&#8221; the team announced.</p>

<p>According to Orbiter Finance, while filing a claim form, consumers must include a signed notification to confirm that they possess the address.</p>

<p>On June 1, unscrupulous actors gained access to the Orbiter Finance Discord server. On the platform, the hackers uploaded a link to a bogus airdrop application.</p>



<p>CertiK Alert, a blockchain security and analytics company, first revealed the attack on Twitter. It is the community members&#8217; responsibility to avoid connecting with the links offered on the site. The unscrupulous actors advertised a bogus ORB token launch and airdrop event in which 5,000,000 ORB tokens would be issued to members of the Orbiter Finance community.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://coincu.com/197671-orbiter-finance-stops-events-bitkeep-wallet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Orbiter Finance</a> team also acknowledged the theft on Twitter, emphasizing that the company is working diligently to reclaim control of its Discord server. Via a Twitter thread, the project warned its members not to believe anything on its Discord server.</p>



<p>According to CertiK Alert monitoring, Orbiter Finance&#8217;s Twitter account was recently <a href="https://coincu.com/197635-orbiter-finance-twitter-account-hacked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hacked</a>, and tweets containing phishing links were posted.

Orbiter Finance <a href="https://coincu.com/197744-orbiter-finance-confirms-account-not-hacked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">responded</a> on social media to CertiK&#8217;s warning that its official Twitter account had been hacked by stating that its official Twitter account is secure and has not been compromised.</p>

<p>This is Binance&#8217;s latest move towards the troubled Multichain cross-chain bridge. Previously, Binance had temporarily <a href="https://coincu.com/189765-binance-10-bridge-token-multichain-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suspended</a> the top-up of tokens via the project-linked bridge the day after this incident. Deposits for pairs POLS-BSC, ACH-BSC, BIFI-FTM, SUPER-BSC, AVA-ETH, SPELL-AVAXC, ALPACA-FTM, FTM-ETH, FARM-BSC and DEXE-BSC have been affected by This situation.</p>



<p>The event started on May 24, the Twitter social network stirred up information that the authorities had arrested the Multichain team in China. At the same time, many on-chain signs indicate<a href="https://coincu.com/189798-9-7-million-ftms-binance-multichain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> suspicious movements </a>related to the MULTI token.</p>

<p>Multichain has confirmed that some of the project&#8217;s cross-chain remittance gateways are not working due to &#8220;force majeure reasons, &#8221; with unknown recovery time.</p>



<p>Multichain pledged to compensate affected users fully but did not disclose any further information on the compensation plan.</p>



<p>Data tracking site Lookonchain has detected moves to transfer large amounts of MULTI tokens to the Gate exchange. This increasingly worries the users of this bridge.</p>



<p>According to the update, some cross-chain bridges of the Multichain protocol have been restored and are now operational as of June 5. Tung Dinh, Vice President of Multichain, confirmed the restoration of the Multichain router2 router, showing that the core component of the bridge is back to normal. There is also speculation about the condition of Multichain&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, Zhao Jun, that he may have been released from prison.</p>

<p>The technology enables DBS China corporate clients to collect payments in <a href="https://coincu.com/161200-e-cny-now-accessible-for-securities-trading/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e-CNY</a>, China&#8217;s central bank digital currency (CBDC), and utilize automatic settlement of e-CNY straight into their CNY bank deposit account.</p>



<p>Businesses may now automate the settlement of e-CNY into their bank deposit accounts thanks to the newly introduced merchant collection platform. <a href="https://coincu.com/167379-dbs-digital-exchanges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DBS</a> stated that at least one customer has already utilized this platform for a transaction.</p>



<p>DBS China CEO Ginger Cheng said that the bank had completed its first e-CNY collection for a Shenzhen catering firm.</p>

<p>Among other advantages, the technology offers easy reconciliation by delivering consolidated merchant reports with itemized e-CNY transactions – the report is available through DBS IDEAL, the bank&#8217;s digital business banking platform.</p>

<p>After its trial introduction in April 2020, e-CNY use in China has gradually increased. As of December 2022, there were about 13.6 billion e-CNY in circulation. The CBDC is now recognized in 26 Chinese cities and 17 provinces, with acceptance likely to increase as the program steadily spreads to other locations. According to official figures, e-CNY accounts for 0.13% of China&#8217;s central bank&#8217;s currency and reserves.</p>
