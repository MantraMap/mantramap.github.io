The latest surge took the price to its highest level since early May. Avalanche was another notable gainer today, rebounding from recent losses.</strong></p>
<h2>Dogecoin (DOGE)</h2>
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) climbed to a fresh multi-month high on Tuesday, as traders continued to react to Twitter’s rebrand to X.</p>
<p>Following a low of $0.07353 to start the week, DOGE/USD spiked to a peak of $0.07811 earlier in today’s session.</p>
<p>This resulted in the meme coin climbing to its strongest point since May 6, which is the last time price was above $0.08000.</p>

<p>Honing in on the chart, it can be seen that a breakout of the 63.00 zone on the relative strength index (RSI) triggered this latest rally.</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is tracking at 66.66, and looks set to be heading for a ceiling at 70.00.</p>
<p>In the event this destination is reached, there is a good chance that DOGE will be back at $0.08000.</p>

<h2>Avalanche (AVAX)</h2>
<p>Additionally, avalanche (AVAX) was back in the green during today’s session, after rebounding from Monday’s decline.</p>
<p>AVAX/USD ascended to a high of $13.38 earlier in the day, a day after slipping to a bottom at $12.92 to start the week.</p>
<p>The move came as the token closed in on a key support level at $12.90, however bulls rejected a breakout on this occasion.</p>

<p>Price strength also held firm at a support point of 44.00, before rising to a current reading at 47.28.</p>
<p>Despite this, momentum remains bearish, with the 10-day (red) moving average nearing a downwards crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.</p>

So far this year, a total of nine such block rewards from the 2010 era have been spent, resulting in the transfer of 450 bitcoins.</strong></p>
<h2>2010 Block Spend Makes the Ninth This Year</h2>
<p>According to btcparser.com, a rare 2010 block reward was <a href="https://btcparser.com/?a=15tABe48T1RH2sQXCtztL74R9me3VPehni">spent</a> on Monday, transferring 50 bitcoins to an unidentified address. Although 50 bitcoins may not be a substantial sum, it is valued at $1.4 million, and expenditures of bitcoins from 2010 have become much less common nowadays. Moreover, the 50 bitcoins were essentially valueless back then, as bitcoin did not hit the <a href="https://www.statmuse.com/money/ask/bitcoin+price+2010">five-cent mark</a> until July 17, 2010.</p>
<p>The funds were transferred to a <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/bc1qtahv60m9pwhym245urvql507f08e2yh7zwjnqu">specific bitcoin address</a> and moved on from there. Blockchair&#x2019;s privacy tool indicated that the transfer scored a 5 out of 100 on privacy, citing three issues, and it labeled the privacy level as &#x201C;low.&#x201D; The issues comprised the fact that the funds were swept, the same address appeared multiple times in the inputs, and the inputs were of diverse types.</p>
<p>The 2010 block reward transfer on Monday marked the ninth such expenditure this year, with the most recent previous transactions from this era occurring on June 26. On that day, two transfers took place, amounting to a total of 100 bitcoins. Moreover, both block rewards were acquired on the same day, July 12, 2010, which suggests they were transferred by the same individual.</p>

<p>Thus far in 2023, a total of nine 2010 block reward transfers have occurred, but only eight of these were from virgin, dormant bitcoin rewards. A <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/a1d49167de850e0d12a2f57f41258dcf8c2544d7acf4283748ad18942156536f">transaction</a> that occurred on April 22, 2023, spent a 50-bitcoin block reward, but the address had also <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/d7dd3050ba3ff04e8a14518b753ef7630234a66b63e9a91ed78099400abb1105">spent</a> a small amount, or 0.00001094 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, from the wallet on August 10, 2021. The remaining eight transactions, including the one on Monday, involved completely untouched block rewards that had remained idle for 13 years.</p>

<h2>Sam Altman Backed Worldcoin Launches Officially</h2>
<p>Worldcoin, the decentralized ID and wallet protocol backed by Sam Altman, CEO of Openai, announced its official launch on Monday. The project, which had been in its development stages for more than three years, is finally opening its services to the public, expanding its reach and aiming to reel in <a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1683380244013809664?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2 billion users</a> worldwide.</p>
<p>Worldcoin has two different components: World ID, a decentralized identity protocol that uses individuals&#8217; irises as a &#8220;proof of personhood&#8221; verification, using specialized devices called &#8220;Orbs&#8221; for this task, and World App, which allows users to receive incentives in the form of WLD, the native token of the protocol, and transfer and manage these resources with an internal wallet.</p>
<p>On reaching this milestone, Altman <a href="https://worldcoin.org/cofounder-letter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Worldcoin is an attempt at global scale alignment, the journey will be challenging and the outcome is uncertain. But finding new ways to broadly share the coming technological prosperity is a critical challenge of our time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>75% of the initial 10 billion WLD issuance will be <a href="https://whitepaper.worldcoin.org/tokenomics#technical-information" target="_blank" rel="noopener">granted</a> to users, while Tools For Humanity, the team behind the Worldcoin idea, and its investors, will retain ownership of the remaining 25%.</p>

<h2>Orb Acceleration</h2>
<p>While users can reserve their share of WLD tokens, they need to physically prove their humanness by getting their irises read by an Orb. To accelerate the growth of the protocol, Worldcoin also <a href="https://worldcoin.org/blog/announcements/worldcoin-begins-rollout-orbs-meet-global-demand-world-id" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a rollout of more than 1,500 orbs to more than 35 cities.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sam-altman-backed-worldcoin-reaches-2-million-signups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">More</a> than 2 million users have already signed up using World ID, and with this move, Worldcoin expects to add more than 40,000 sign-ups weekly. The rollout of the devices will be focused on countries that have shown themselves to be receptive to Worldcoin&#8217;s proposal. In Spain, Worldcoin will ostensibly expand its operation 3x due to the more than 150,000 users that have already registered in the initial testing phases.</p>
<p>In countries like Brazil and France, the rollout will be more limited. Altman stated that, for the time being, Worldcoin will not be available in the U.S. due to a lack of regulatory clarity.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
After dropping to a one-month low to start the week, bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) rebounded in today&#x2019;s session.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD jumped to a peak at $29,327.86 earlier in the day, following Monday&#x2019;s drop to a bottom of $28,934.29.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Bitcoin bulls rejected the pressure to settle at a support point of $28,800, and now seem to be targeting a ceiling of $30,000.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
One reason why the price appears to have stabilized is the relative strength index (RSI), which found a floor of its own around 42.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
At the time of writing, price strength is tracking at 41.90, with the next point of support around the 37.00 mark.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Currently, it appears that price will remain marginally stable above $29,000, however this could change following this afternoon&#x2019;s report.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) bounced from a support point of its own on Tuesday, after slipping to a multi-week low on Monday.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Following a bottom at $1,836.85 to start the week, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD marginally rose to an intraday high of $1,862.43 in today&#x2019;s session.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The bounce came after ethereum moved away from a recent support point at the $1,830 mark, with $1,900 now the likely target.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Similar to bitcoin, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>&#x2019;s RSI settled at a floor around 43.00, which has played a big part in halting yesterday&#x2019;s sell-off.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Now tracking at 45.00, the next visible point of resistance lies at 50.00, and a move to this point will almost certainly send <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> to $1,900.&#13;<br />

In this issue, Argentina reached a new agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Bitfarms will open two bitcoin mining farms in Paraguay, and Venezuela is now accepting MIR card payments.</strong></p>
<h2>Argentina Reaches New Disbursement Agreement With the IMF</h2>
<p>Argentina has reached a new agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to accelerate the delivery of resources during this year. According to Economy Minister Sergio Massa, this new deal includes the disbursement of funds to Argentina in August and November, allowing the embattled nation to replenish its reserves at least for this year. While Massa declined to mention specific numbers, he stated these payments were able to fulfill the country&#8217;s expectations.</p>
<p>Also, Massa declared this agreement reinforces the ability of the Central Bank of Argentina to intervene and balance its internal exchange system. The bank had been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/central-bank-of-argentina-reduces-dollar-and-yuan-disbursement-to-importers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reducing</a> foreign currency sales to importers as its reserves touched historic lows.</p>
<p>Massa <a href="https://www.telam.com.ar/notas/202307/634848-fmi-objetivos-parametros-argentina.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From now on, you have a Central Bank that does not have a dilemma to make payments and you have less pressure on financial dollars that influence price remarking.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Bitfarms to Launch Two Bitcoin Mining Farms in Paraguay</h2>
<p>Bitfarms, a Nasdaq-listed Bitcoin mining company, announced that it had secured two power purchasing agreements in Paraguay to build two new Bitcoin mining operations in the country. The company acquired up to 50 MW of power in Villarrica and 100 MW in Iguazu. The power contracted has a hydroelectrical origin to ensure the new sites will operate using renewables.</p>
<p>Geoff Morphy, CEO of Bitfarms, <a href="https://investor.bitfarms.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/201/bitfarms-secures-contracts-in-paraguay-for-up-to-150-mw-of" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declared</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Paraguay has access to an abundance of surplus renewable power, and these acquisitions secure valuable, yet limited, sustainable energy contracts while broadening our foothold in a resource-rich country.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Villarrica&#8217;s site construction is slated to start in Q3 2023, while a construction timeline for Iguazu hasn&#8217;t been determined yet.</p>

<h2>Venezuela Starts Processing MIR Card Payments</h2>
<p>Russian Ambassador to Caracas Sergey Melik-Bagdasarov informed that Venezuela was already processing payments from Russian MIR cards. The pioneer spot for this adoption move is located on the eastern island of Margarita, a tourist location.</p>
<p>Melik-Bagdasarov <a href="https://tass.com/economy/1649101" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The start of [Mir card] payments has already begun on Margarita Island, which is ready to host and is accommodating Russian tourists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ambassador stated that while Mir payments were also being tested in Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, there were still technical issues to be addressed. The Venezuelan government <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/venezuela-to-integrate-russian-mir-payments-system-in-de-dollarization-push/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> it was working on this integration in June.</p>

Watkins also claims that the flexibility of such a decentralized network means users can &#8220;rapidly scale and adjust the network to better reflect demand.&#8221; This, in turn, can result in more reliable connections for users. </strong></p>
<h2>A Decentralized Mobile Network Offers Users a &#8216;Greater Level of Security&#8217;</h2>
<p>Watkins also told Bitcoin.com News that his company&#8217;s attempt to bring the internet to the masses via innovative technologies is comparable to past efforts by tech giants like Google and Facebook. The World Mobile founder, however, insisted that his company is not competing with tech giants. Instead, World Mobile — a telecommunication network built on a blockchain — sees tech giants as collaborators, he said.</p>
<p>In written comments sent to Bitcoin.com News, Watkins explained how the company&#8217;s infrastructure model and blockchain technology enable his group to overcome the scalability challenge. He also touched on how ordinary people or subscribers can help secure the network by acquiring or hosting nodes.</p>
<p>Below are Watkins&#8217; answers sent to Bitcoin.com News via Telegram.</p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin.com News (BCN): The internet is a core pillar of the modern information society, yet an estimated two billion people are still without access. This may be because it is not commercially viable for traditional telecom operators to bring the internet to certain geographical regions. Do you believe a blockchain-powered decentralized network is capable of connecting underserved users in an economically efficient manner?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Micky Watkins (MW):</strong> World Mobile utilizes a unique solution which combines two core elements. The first is our hybrid dynamic network, which consists of a decentralized network of what we call ‘Airnodes.&#8217; Airnodes range from small, wifi-hotspots, right up to Aerostats, which are lighter than air balloons that act as telecommunications towers in the sky. They contain radio equipment and distribute coverage over a much wider area than traditional cell towers, between 75km-100km. This hybrid dynamic network reduces rollout and maintenance costs, allowing for profitable operations in under-connected regions.</p>
<p>This hybrid dynamic network is then connected to our blockchain-powered sharing economy, which incentivizes individuals and businesses to connect their communities with our infrastructure, and subsequently rewards them for doing so.</p>
<p>These two elements combine to significantly reduce both the Capex [capital expenditure] and Opex [operational expenditure], resulting in a network which is at least 12 times cheaper to deploy than a legacy model.</p>
<p><strong>BCN: What advantages, if any, does a decentralized wireless network have over traditional telecom operators and why should a subscriber choose a decentralized wireless network over a traditional carrier?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MW:</strong> I’d suggest that once you understand the advantages of a decentralized operator like World Mobile, there will no longer be a choice to make.</p>
<p>Firstly, the reduced operating cost is passed on to our customers and in Zanzibar, the home of our first commercial deployment, our data bundles are almost 50% cheaper than the average. That alone is impressive, but when combined with the greater accessibility of our network, especially in under-connected and rural locations, it becomes an even more attractive offering.</p>
<p>Secondly, by integrating blockchain, we offer customers a much greater level of security and ownership of their data. It’s a well-known fact that many traditional operators profit from selling customer data, including location data and financial information. Customer and transaction data on World Mobile is encrypted on the blockchain and is immutable. This level of transparency is unattainable when using a traditional operator.</p>
<p>Finally, the flexibility of our infrastructure means we can rapidly scale and adjust the network to better reflect demand, resulting in more reliable connections for our customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p><strong>BCN: Your company claims to be the first global mobile network built on blockchain. Can you tell us what your infrastructure looks like and how the blockchain technology fits into it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MW:</strong> We have developed the World Mobile Chain, a Proof-of-Stake network that is a sidechain of Cardano. The World Mobile Chain is used to process network usage data and transactions. When a user purchases credit and starts to consume data through one of our Airnodes, their data traffic is encrypted and passes through our validator nodes (Earthnodes) which process and authenticate the network usage.</p>
<p>A record of this usage is then stored on a distributed ledger and the participants supporting the network i.e. Airnode Owners, Hosts and Earthnode Operators are rewarded with a share of the revenue, through our native utility token WMT.</p>
<p><strong>BCN: Over the last decade or so, a number of technology giants including Facebook, Google, and Spacex have tried to bring Internet connectivity to the unconnected using innovative technologies. Their goals are similar to yours. Do you see them as collaborators or competitors?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MW:</strong> We don’t see them as competitors. Starlink has a great product, but it’s not a solution for the challenge of connecting the unconnected at scale. The upfront cost of the hardware limits accessibility and the lack of subsidies outside the USA makes it unviable in many parts of the world. That said, we do see them as collaborators and World Mobile utilises Starlink as a backhaul to provide connectivity in rural locations.</p>
<p><strong>BCN: World Mobile is said to be a people-run mobile network but it is also known that mobile networks are highly capital-intensive and complex. What are the different ways, if any, in which subscribers can own and operate a mobile network infrastructure?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MW:</strong> World Mobile offers subscribers a number of ways to participate and benefit from the sharing economy. You could opt to buy an Airnode. Our entry-level Airnodes will be priced in a similar bracket to popular consumer tech products and will provide owners the opportunity to connect their community, or unconnected communities around the world. This is where Airnode hosts come in. An Airnode owner can choose to host an Airnode at their location or they can allow us to connect them to a host in a different part of the world. The host takes on responsibility for operating and maintaining the Airnode on the ground. Both owners and hosts earn a share of the revenue when mobile users connect to their Airnodes.</p>
<p>It doesn’t stop there though. Our recently launched Android application allows users to actively contribute to network expansion, through a feature currently called ‘scan for points.&#8217; This feature allows users to utilize their smartphone radios to help identify connectivity weak spots and potential Airnode locations, rewarding them with points that can be redeemed in the app’s marketplace.</p>
<p><strong>BCN: According to reports, you have completed field tests in several countries including Nigeria, Kenya, Mozambique, and Pakistan. Scalability often becomes an issue when onboarding millions of users. Can you tell our readers how you solve scalability to provide affordable and reliable internet access to both rural and underserved areas worldwide?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MW:</strong> Scalability might be a challenge for a centralized mobile network operator, which takes on responsibility for the deployment and operation of infrastructure, but scalability is a built-in feature of the World Mobile Network.</p>
<p>Our unique infrastructure model and blockchain-powered sharing economy provide the foundations needed to support and incentivize the rapid rollout of distributed infrastructure wherever demand might be.</p>

The Institute of International Finance Economist urged G7 countries to consider cutting the Russian oil price cap from $60 to $50. </strong></p>
<h2>Ruble Down by Over 18% in 2023</h2>
<p>According to Robin Brooks, the chief economist at the Institute of International Finance (IIF), the Russian currency — the ruble — has now &#8220;stabilized&#8221; and is likely to be bolstered by rising oil prices in the coming months. Brooks, a former chief forex strategist at Goldman Sachs, also noted in a tweet that while Russia’s June current was in deficit, G7 countries’ failure to reduce the oil price cap from $60 to $50 per barrel could well give &#8220;the ruble a lift.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Russia&#39;s Ruble has stabilized. The summer months are always a soft spot for the Ruble &#8211; the June current acount was in deficit &#8211; but now rising oil prices are giving the Ruble a lift, which helps Russia&#39;s war machine. Cutting the G7 oil price cap from $60 to $50 is way overdue&#8230; <a href="https://t.co/KmVXneErbp">pic.twitter.com/KmVXneErbp</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Robin Brooks (@RobinBrooksIIF) <a href="https://twitter.com/RobinBrooksIIF/status/1682834744457801728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>At the time of writing (July 24, 15.30 EST) one U.S. dollar bought just over 90 rubles. In contrast, approximately 73 rubles would buy one dollar at the start of 2023. This means the ruble has <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/RUB-USD?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiAiu6viaiAAxVERuUKHeWuDNEQmY0JegQIDRAc&amp;window=YTD">depreciated</a> by just over 18% since the start of the year. Steve Hanke, the Johns Hopkins economics professor, has <a href="https://twitter.com/steve_hanke/status/1683227990124285952">said</a> the ruble’s &#8220;free-fall is fueling raging inflation&#8221; in Russia which he measures at 50 per annum.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Brooks’ July 22 <a href="https://twitter.com/RobinBrooksIIF/status/1682834744457801728">tweet</a> is the latest in which the IIF economist has urged Western countries to further restrict Russia’s ability to fend off the effects of sanctions via increased oil revenues. As previously <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/american-economists-are-baffled-by-an-unusual-situation-as-russias-ruble-is-the-worlds-best-performing-fiat-currency/">reported</a> by Bitcoin.com News, the Russian ruble was at one point in 2022 the world&#8217;s best-performing currency. At the time, some experts attributed the currency’s rise and resilience to surging energy prices.</p>

<h2>Russian Oil Producers Defy Sanctions</h2>
<p>However, after the winter ended demand for oil and gas subsided and this saw the price of Urals crude — Russia’s main grade of oil — drop from a year high of just over $100 per barrel in 2022 to prices under $60 for much of 2023. Many Western commentators have attributed the drop in the prices of Urals to the price cap. Others including Brooks have called for the further reduction of the price cap but the G7 countries have so far ignored the calls.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ever since Russia invaded Ukraine, Chinese exports to Georgia, Belarus, Kazakhstan &amp; Turkey are through the roof. The answer here isn&#8217;t to tighten export controls for goods that may end up in Russia. The answer is to lower the G7 cap so Putin doesn&#8217;t have cash to buy stuff,&#8221; Brooks said in an earlier tweet.</p>
<p>In the meantime, a July 22 Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-defies-sanctions-by-selling-oil-above-price-cap-bae1c271">report</a> suggested that the effectiveness of the G7’s price cap may be waning after the price of Urals crude breached $60 in April. The report pointed to the surging demand for Urals crude by countries like India and China as one of the primary reasons why the price of the commodity went past $60. Oil output cuts agreed upon by OPEC countries are cited as the other reason why Russian oil producers were able to sell at prices above the price cap.</p>
<p>Despite this breach, Western officials such as the United States Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo insist that the price cap is still working.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fundamentally, the price cap is holding down Russia’s revenue significantly, while continuing to create a world in which global markets are being supplied with Russian oil,&#8221; Adeyemo reportedly said.</p>

<h2>Jim Rickards Speculates BRICS Currency Will Be Anchored to a Weight of Gold</h2>
<p>Jim Rickards, economist and best-selling author, has commented on his vision of a hypothetical BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) bloc currency and how it could be leveraged to devalue the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>To Rickards, the &#8220;bric&#8221; — the name he gives the BRICS currency — will be anchored to a determined weight in gold, but not backed by it. This is because the BRICS nations will free-ride on top of the gold markets without intervening to manage the bric-dollar peg.</p>
<p>This will also allow its price to go up as inflation and devaluation hit the U.S. dollar, ostensibly leading to the greenback&#8217;s destruction. On this, Rickards <a href="https://usawatchdog.com/new-brics-currency-boosts-gold-destroys-dollar-jim-rickards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s a way to destroy the dollar. You don’t need dollars and you don’t need gold. You just need to be smart enough to anchor your currency to gold, and when dollar inflation starts to go up, your currency is going to be worth more because of how you pegged it, not to dollars, but how you pegged it to gold.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, Rickards acknowledges that this might take years to happen.</p>

<h2>Disrupting Supply Chains</h2>
<p>Rickards stated that another way of turbocharging the debasement of the U.S. dollar would be to interfere with the supply chains of commodities in the world. He mentioned the end of the Black Sea grain deal between Russia and Ukraine as an example, stating that grain prices went up by 10% just after the announcement of the suspension.</p>
<p>On this, Rickards explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, if I were a BRICS member, and I were Russia in particular, and I had this currency tied to gold, and I wanted my currency to be more valuable and your currency (U.S. dollar) less valuable, one of the ways to do that is mess with the supply chain and drive up the price of oil, gasoline, grain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In January, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov <a href="https://tass.com/politics/1566969" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a> that the bloc would discuss an official currency this August. However, South Africa&#8217;s diplomat in charge of BRICS relations, Anil Sooklal, recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-currency-not-on-agenda-for-leaders-summit-nations-to-focus-on-de-dollarization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declared</a> this topic was not on the agenda for the upcoming summit.</p>

A verdict that has sparked a ripple, pun intended, in the crypto space, potentially creating waves of disarray for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</strong>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<em>The following opinion editorial was written by Joseph Collement, General Counsel at Bitcoin.com.</em>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
This <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/what-does-the-xrp-not-a-security-ruling-mean-for-other-cryptocurrencies-7561320">legal ruling</a> re-echoes the content of the now-infamous 2018 Hinman speech, a speech that the SEC passionately endeavored to keep out of the Ripple case&#x2019;s evidentiary repertoire. This is the same speech whose author, Hinman, was meticulously<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sec-quietly-removes-director-william-201214915.html"> wiped off</a> the SEC&#x2019;s official website in June 2023, much to the bemusement and consternation of the crypto community. The echo from Hinman&#x2019;s 2018 address rings louder in the SEC&#x2019;s now empty corridors.&#13;</p>
<h2>Who Is William Hinman, and Why Does His Speech Matter?</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
William Hinman served as the Director of the Division of Corporation Finance at the SEC from 2017 to 2020. On June 14, 2018, Hinman, in a thought-provoking proposition,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speech-hinman-061418"> suggested</a> that cryptocurrency startups could initially sell tokens as securities to raise funds before transitioning to non-security utility tokens once their networks are operational and the tokens have a functional use.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
This perspective recognizes the dynamic nature of digital assets and how their classification can evolve over time, aligning with the economic reality of cryptocurrency projects. This adaptive approach to crypto token regulation, endorsed by SEC Chairman Jay Clayton in 2019, showcased an understanding of the &#x201C;economic reality&#x201D; that while some projects may satisfy the Howey test for securities at their inception, this status can evolve over time.&#13;</p>
<h2>The SEC&#x2019;s U-Turn and the Ensuing Saga</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
The SEC&#x2019;s initial challenge to Hinman&#x2019;s speech being admissible as evidence in the Ripple case was premised on two assertions. First, the speech was not a reflection of the SEC&#x2019;s official stance. Second, the speech was privileged, owing to Hinman&#x2019;s role as the Director of Corporation Finance. However, the court was unimpressed by SEC&#x2019;s arguments and ruled the speech admissible on a limited basis.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In an eyebrow-raising move, the SEC decided to erase Hinman&#x2019;s digital footprint from its official website on June 6, 2023, a decision that did not go unnoticed by the ever-vigilant crypto community. This deliberate purge underscored the lengths to which the SEC was willing to go to prevent Ripple from using Hinman&#x2019;s insight as part of their defense.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>What Are the Implications for the SEC?</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
The Ripple ruling, if used as a legal precedent in ongoing and future cases, could deal a devastating blow to the SEC. The court&#x2019;s verdict implies that digital assets traded on secondary markets do not fall under the umbrella of securities, relieving crypto exchanges from the necessity to register with the SEC.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
This means that the SEC&#x2019;s hard-fought crusade for jurisdiction over crypto exchanges and digital assets could be rendered futile. Such an outcome is a hard pill to swallow for the regulatory body. However, it could open the door to a new era of thoughtful regulation. Regulation that seeks to safeguard consumers while simultaneously encouraging innovation, without burdening it with unwieldy and costly regulatory prerequisites.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The Ripple case not only highlights the ongoing struggle to define and regulate cryptocurrencies but also illustrates the potential for significant shifts in the regulatory landscape based on a single court decision. The SEC, on its part, needs to adapt to these ever-evolving realities of the crypto world rather than resort to prejudgment, erasure, and denial. After all, the crypto tide is not going to recede anytime soon.&#13;<br />
