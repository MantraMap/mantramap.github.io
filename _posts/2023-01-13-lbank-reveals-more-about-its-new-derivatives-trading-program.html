<p>INTERNET CITY,, DUBAI, 13th January, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>Global exchange LBank has revealed more details about its new system for trading crypto derivatives. The exchange&rsquo;s tech team has shared fresh information about the update which was implemented on December 27 and has disclosed further upcoming improvements.</p>
<p>LBank&rsquo;s new industry-leading derivatives system promises a stable, user-centric experience 24/7. The updated system for handling LBank&rsquo;s derivatives products features more flexible trading options including functions for managing stop-losses and managing profits, more comprehensive data charts, and security enhancements. A dedicated service team is on hand to help users with trading problems in a timely manner and gather user feedback for the tech team.</p>
<p>The new derivatives trading system is a milestone release for LBank&rsquo;s tech team, which shared: &ldquo;After six months of hard work and tons of feedback sessions with users, we are very excited about the final product.
