<p>Road Town, BVI, June 7th, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>Digital asset trading platform LBank Exchange is to list the ELMOERC (ELMO) token. The ELMO/USDT trading pair will officially go live on LBank at 9:00 UTC on Jun 9, 2023.</p><p>ELMOERC (ELMO) is a memecoin project whose token features a unique "burn and earn" mechanism. The listing of ELMO on LBank Exchange will expand its global footprint and support deeper liquidity.</p><p>The ELMO token imposes a 10% tax on DEX trades and 6% on CEX trades, mechanisms that support a robust circular economy. The goal of ELMOERC is to become the ultimate memecoin through a rapidly reducing supply, utility, and accessibility.</p><p>The team behind ELMO intend to introduce staking, NFTs, and many other features. Long-term diamond holders are rewarded through substantial burns funded by taxes imposed on sellers. Whenever someone sells, the total supply reduces, increasing demand for the remaining circulating supply due to scarcity.</p><p>About ELMO Token</p><p>ELMOERC is a memecoin with an aggressive burn mechanism that has seen 125M tokens burnt since its launch.
