<p>Do Kwon has been sentenced to four months in jail by a Montenegro district court for forging travel documents. </p>
<p>Bloomberg reports that a Montenegrin Basic Court in the country&rsquo;s capital of Podgorica sentenced Do Kwon and his associate Han Chang-Joon to four months in jail for forging travel documents. The infamous co-founder of the collapsed Terraform Labs was arrested in March in Podgorica, where he was found attempting to travel to Dubai with a forged passport.</p>
<p>Kwon and Joon were found guilty of forgery charges, and two Costa Rican and Belgian passports and two identity cards belonging to Kwon and Joon were confiscated. A Basic Court in Podgorica shared the verdict on Monday and said the pair&rsquo;s time spent in detention would be included in their sentence.</p>
<p>The duo have been in custody despite being released on bail early in June.</p>
Do Kwon: An Internationally Wanted Man
<p>Kwon is a South Korean national who stands accused on charges of multibillion-dollar fraud related to the collapse of the Terra ecosystem in May 2022. Terraform&rsquo;s algorithmic stablecoin and crypto project Terra-Luna collapsed, wiping out $40 billion in market cap and sending the overall crypto market into a spiral.</p>
<p>Following Terra&rsquo;s collapse, South Korean authorities charged Kwon in September for violating its Capital Markets Act and issued a warrant for his arrest.</p>
<p>The International Criminal Police Organisation (Interpol) accordingly issued a red notice for Kwon, signalling international law enforcement agencies to track him down and arrest him on charges of fraud.</p>
<p>US Federal prosecutors further indicted Kwon with two counts each of securities fraud, wire fraud, commodities fraud, and conspiracy.</p>
<p>Both South Korea and the US are seeking Kwon&rsquo;s extradition.</p>
