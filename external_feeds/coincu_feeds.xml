<p>According to CoinGecko&#8217;s latest report on the cryptocurrency industry in the second quarter of 2023, spot trading volumes on the top ten centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (CEX) totaled $1.42 trillion, marking a significant decrease of 43.2% compared to the first quarter. Despite some signs of recovery in Q1, transaction volumes failed to sustain an upward trend in Q2.</p>



<p>Binance, one of the leading exchanges, experienced a decline in dominance, slipping from 61% in March 2023 to 52% in June 2023. The exchange faced mounting regulatory pressures, contributing to this decrease. Additionally, Huobi and Crypto.com dropped out of the top ten list, making way for Bybit and Bitget. Bybit and Bitget were the only exchanges within the top ten to observe volume growth, with increases of $13.1 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively.</p>

<p>As reported by CoinGecko, in the second quarter of 2023, <a href="https://coincu.com/201909-senior-security-engineer-charged-with-9m/">decentralized exchanges</a> (DEX) saw a decline in spot trading volumes, which totaled $155 billion, down by 30.8% compared to the first quarter. Despite this decline, Uniswap maintained its position as the largest DEX, holding a dominant market share of 70% in May.</p>



<p>The Q2 report reflects the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market, with shifts in trading volumes and market share among both centralized and decentralized exchanges. Regulatory pressures and changing market conditions played a significant role in shaping the landscape during this period.</p>



<p>As the industry continues to evolve, it will be interesting to observe how market dynamics and regulatory developments impact trading volumes and the dominance of key players in the cryptocurrency exchange sector.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Shareholders sue Marathon Digital&#8217;s CEO and executives, alleging breach of duties and mismanagement.</em></li>



<li><em>Claims include violations of the US Exchange Act and unjust enrichment.</em></li>



<li><em>Shareholders seek retribution and propose governance reforms.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Marathon Digital, a prominent US-based crypto mining company, is facing a legal battle initiated by its shareholders.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/marathon_digital_07acbf75d5.webp"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="717" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/marathon_digital_07acbf75d5-1024x717.webp" alt="Shareholders Of Marathon Digital To Launch Legal Battle With Allegations Of Breach" class="wp-image-203652" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/marathon_digital_07acbf75d5-1024x717.webp 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/marathon_digital_07acbf75d5-300x210.webp 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/marathon_digital_07acbf75d5-768x538.webp 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/marathon_digital_07acbf75d5-1536x1075.webp 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/marathon_digital_07acbf75d5-750x525.webp 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/marathon_digital_07acbf75d5-1140x798.webp 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/marathon_digital_07acbf75d5.webp 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Shareholders Of Marathon Digital To Launch Legal Battle With Allegations Of Breach 9"></a></figure></div>


<p>The lawsuit, <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67570049/1/hood-v-thiel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed</a> in the United States District Court of Nevada on July 8, accuses CEO Fred Thiel and other top executives of breaching fiduciary duties, engaging in unjust enrichment, and wasting corporate assets.</p>



<p>The shareholder complaint outlines five claims against Thiel and nine other Marathon executives, including violations of the US Exchange Act, breach of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment, and corporate asset mismanagement. The plaintiffs seek retribution for alleged wrongful acts that led to a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) complaint against the company. However, they have left the determination of specific compensation amounts to the court.</p>



<p>Beyond seeking restitution, the shareholders also aim to address governance issues within Marathon Digital. Their proposals include strengthening Board supervision, nominating shareholder candidates for the Board, and reforming the process for electing directors.</p>



<p>The legal team representing the shareholders asserts that Marathon&#8217;s management has downplayed challenges, inflated the company&#8217;s valuation, received excessive compensation, engaged in insider sales, and obtained unwarranted bonuses based on misleading statements.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/192527-marathon-digital-purchases-shares-series-a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon Digital</a> has previously come under <a href="https://coincu.com/186635-marathon-digital-holdings-new-subpoena-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEC scrutiny</a>. In May, the company received a subpoena related to transactions with related parties during the establishment of a mining facility in Montana. The SEC had previously ordered Marathon to provide documents and communications concerning the same facility.</p>

<p>Despite these legal hurdles, Marathon CEO Fred Thiel expressed optimism in May about the company&#8217;s strategy to reduce its net loss. The goal was to decrease the net loss from $12.9 million ($0.12 per share) in Q1 2022 to $7.2 million ($0.05 per share) in the current year.</p>



<p>To tackle its debt, Marathon made significant progress by paying off a term loan with <a href="https://coincu.com/149594-silvergate-requested-by-us-senators/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silvergate Bank</a> in March. This move enabled the release of 3,132 Bitcoins held as collateral, effectively eliminating $50 million in debt and reducing annual borrowing costs by $5 million.</p>



<p>Marathon&#8217;s Bitcoin holdings have been on the rise, <a href="https://coincu.com/200620-marathon-digital-holdings-sells-700-btc-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">totaling</a> 12,538 BTC as of July 1. Despite a decrease in production and transaction fees, the company managed to produce 979 Bitcoins in June, emphasizing energy efficiency through the use of S19 XPs.</p>



<p>In addition to legal challenges and operational updates, Marathon Digital <a href="https://coincu.com/195572-marathon-digital-issued-a-warning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued</a> a warning about fraudulent activities. The company clarified that it does not provide accounts for individual investors to participate in cryptocurrency mining, nor does it accept funds from such investors. Marathon is aware of counterfeit websites, applications, and individuals impersonating company personnel. They are also vigilant about counterfeit stock certificates being sold in other languages, particularly in Russia and potentially other international markets.</p>

<p>Marathon Digital Holdings faces a complex period due to legal disputes with shareholders, regulatory scrutiny from the SEC, and the prevalence of fraudulent activities. These factors will significantly impact the company&#8217;s future trajectory as it navigates the competitive landscape of the cryptocurrency mining industry.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The native token of the 1inch Network, 1INCH, experienced significant volatility, surging by over 80% before encountering a decline.</em></li>



<li><em>Trade volume for 1INCH reached over $630 million, the highest since October 2021, as more cryptocurrency users engaged with the 1inch Network.</em></li>



<li><em>Despite the recent surge, 1INCH saw a decline of over 5.5% in a day, with the price currently at $0.38, indicating potential selling pressures and resistance ahead.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The native token of the 1inch Network, 1INCH, experienced significant volatility in recent trading sessions, with its price soaring by over 80% before encountering a decline. The surge in trade volume accompanied the price movement, reaching a substantial amount of over $630 million, the highest seen since October 2021.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1188.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1188-1024x576.png" alt="1inch Network Token Drops More Than 35% After Recent Hype" class="wp-image-203640" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1188-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1188-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1188-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1188-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1188-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1188.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="1inch Network Token Drops More Than 35% After Recent Hype 12"></a></figure></div>


<p>1INCH serves as the governance token for the decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator, <a href="https://coincu.com/166829-1inch-the-parser-incentive-1-5-mil-inch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1inch Network</a>. The protocol, built on Ethereum, aims to enhance trading liquidity and reduce slippage by aggregating liquidity from multiple decentralized exchanges.</p>



<p>The positive price movement of 1INCH can be attributed to the growing number of cryptocurrency users engaging in transactions on the 1inch Network. Throughout the first half of the year, the active user base has consistently expanded, positively impacting the price of the native token.</p>



<p>Despite this recent surge, the price of 1INCH has experienced a decline of over 5.5% in a single day and over 35% from $0.6, currently standing at $0.38. Over the weekend, Bitcoin remained in a relatively narrow trading range between $30,050 and $30,500, contributing to a subdued market with minimal activity.</p>



<p>The month of July has seen consistent traction for the 1inch Network, with network activity, as measured by Daily Active Addresses (DAA), on the rise. DAA evaluates real-time changes in network activity by tallying the number of unique wallet addresses involved in transactions. A sustained increase in active addresses over an extended period typically exerts upward pressure on the token&#8217;s price.</p>

<p>As the chart reveals, the price of 1INCH has steadily climbed over the past week, culminating in a remarkable surge of over 80%. The altcoin&#8217;s primary declining trendline is marked, and the current focus for the bulls is to overcome this resistance level.</p>

<p>In terms of technical analysis, 1inch Network&#8217;s price is currently trading near a resistance level, with support at around $0.35 and resistance at approximately $0.6. This positioning suggests the possibility of selling pressures ahead, as the token&#8217;s price may be becoming overextended.</p>



<p>The volatility and trading activity surrounding 1INCH demonstrate the continued interest and growth of the 1inch Network. As the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector evolves, the performance of tokens like 1INCH will continue to be closely watched by investors and enthusiasts alike.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Reddit&#8217;s tokens Moons (MOON) and Bricks (BRICK) see volatility amid platform changes.</em></li>



<li><em>Speculation of a potential Kraken listing boosts MOON&#8217;s value, while Reddit&#8217;s terms update impacts BRICK&#8217;s price.</em></li>



<li><em>The social network aims for simplicity, removing certain bonuses while retaining verified virtual goods.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Moons (MOON) and Bricks (BRICK), the native tokens of Reddit&#8217;s r/CryptoCurrency and r/Fortnite subreddits respectively, have experienced significant volatility following recent changes in Reddit&#8217;s product orientation. While Moons witnessed a surge in value, fueled by speculation about potential listing on the cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://coincu.com/199312-kraken-requested-irs-for-customer-information/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kraken</a>, the excitement was partially misplaced.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1186-1024x684.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="684" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1186-1024x684.png" alt="Reddit Community Tokens Skyrocket Over 300% In Just Two Days" class="wp-image-203623" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1186-1024x684.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1186-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1186-768x513.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1186-750x501.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1186-1140x761.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1186.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Reddit Community Tokens Skyrocket Over 300% In Just Two Days 15"></a></figure></div>


<p>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/151a5t2/the_reddit_tos_has_been_changed_and_verified" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">change</a> in Reddit&#8217;s policy regarding the distribution of reward points was revealed through a tweet by the unofficial Twitter account dedicated to r/CryptoCurrency Moons. According to the <a href="https://twitter.com/unofficalMoons/status/1680551451385364482" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweet</a>, Coins, and Rewards, two bonus mechanisms in the Web2 format, will be removed, while the platform will retain <a href="https://coincu.com/136796-reddits-collectible-nft-avatars/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Collectible Avatars</a> and Community Points mechanics. This alteration aims to simplify the platform&#8217;s structure, and further details regarding the new direction for awarding will be announced in the coming months.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to note that the concept of community points, pioneered by Reddit admins through tokens like Moons and Bricks, falls under the category of verified virtual goods, along with Reddit&#8217;s collectible avatars. On the other hand, Reddit coins and awards are considered virtual goods and are set to disappear.</p>



<p>The tweet highlighting these changes refers to an archived copy of the platform&#8217;s terms of use page, indicating that the news itself is several months old. Nonetheless, the information sparked a surge in MOON&#8217;s price, which rose by 270% to over $0.34, as tracked by TradingView. Currently, MOON is listed on exchanges such as SushiSwap, Gate.io, and MEXC.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1184-1024x624.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="624" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1184-1024x624.png" alt="Reddit Community Tokens Skyrocket Over 300% In Just Two Days" class="wp-image-203620" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1184-1024x624.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1184-300x183.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1184-768x468.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1184-1536x935.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1184-2048x1247.png 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1184-750x457.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1184-1140x694.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Reddit Community Tokens Skyrocket Over 300% In Just Two Days 16"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">MOON price chart. <em>Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Similarly, Bricks, the token rewarded for contributions in the r/Fortnite subreddit, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/brick" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">experienced</a> a significant increase in value, surging by 360% in just two days. The reasons behind this surge are linked to the speculation surrounding impending changes on the social network.</p>



<p>Coingecko&#8217;s co-founder and COO, Bobby Ong, acknowledged the impact of the speculation on these tokens&#8217; prices. Ong also suggested that this phenomenon reflects a new trend among social networks in reallocating value to users. His tweet expressed confidence in the future, where social networks will find innovative ways to redistribute value to contributors. Ong mentioned that he himself holds Moon and Brick archives but only for testing purposes.</p>



<p>While the potential listing of Moons on Kraken was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/151a5t2/comment/js8fkkt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hinted</a> at by a member of Kraken&#8217;s support team, it should be noted that Moons are currently supported by a limited number of exchanges, including MEXC, Gate.io, SushiSwap, and RCP Swap. If Kraken were to list Moons, it could bring significant changes to the token&#8217;s trading landscape. Users on the r/CryptoCurrency subreddit humorously speculated that they would adopt Kraken as their exchange of choice. The support team member, named Bill, directed people to a form for filing coin listing requests.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://coincu.com/194304-reddit-crypto-communities/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a> continues to navigate changes in its product orientation, the volatility of Moons and Bricks demonstrates the impact these alterations have on the value and trading activity of community tokens. The future of Reddit&#8217;s awarding system remains uncertain, but the recent developments highlight the evolving landscape of social networks and their efforts to provide value to their user communities.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Shinhan Bank, SCB TechX, and a major financial institution in Taiwan have completed a successful proof-of-concept pilot for stablecoin remittance on the Hedera open-source network.</em></li>



<li><em>The pilot achieved real-time settlement and foreign exchange rate integration across multiple currencies, showcasing the potential for efficient cross-border payments.</em></li>



<li><em>The use of stablecoins offers a low-cost and reliable method for transferring value across borders, increasing financial inclusion and accessibility for underserved communities.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Shinhan Bank, SCB TechX, and a major financial institution in Taiwan have <a href="https://hedera.com/blog/shinhan-bank-scb-techx-successfully-pilot-stablecoin-remittances-on-the-hedera-network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the successful completion of a proof-of-concept (PoC) pilot for stablecoin remittance. This pilot was conducted on the efficient and eco-friendly Hedera open-source public network.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1180-1024x614.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="614" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1180-1024x614.png" alt="Shinhan Bank, SCB TechX Successfully Complete Second Stablecoin Pilot On Hedera" class="wp-image-203606" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1180-1024x614.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1180-300x180.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1180-768x461.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1180-750x450.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1180-1140x684.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1180.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Shinhan Bank, SCB TechX Successfully Complete Second Stablecoin Pilot On Hedera 18"></a></figure></div>


<p>During the pilot, real-time settlement and foreign exchange (FX) rate integration was achieved across the Thai Baht (THB), New Taiwan dollar (NTD), and South Korean won (KRW). The PoC, which is EVM-compatible, allows any EVM-based stablecoin issuers to participate using the framework in the future.</p>



<p>This PoC builds upon <a href="https://coincu.com/125948-shinhan-card-launches-blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shinhan Bank</a>&#8216;s previous work in stablecoin international remittances, demonstrating progress in the pursuit of efficient and cost-effective cross-border payments.</p>



<p>Byunghee Kim, Chief of the Blockchain division at Shinhan Bank, expressed satisfaction with the partnership with Hedera and highlighted the importance of stablecoins for facilitating cross-border remittances. He emphasized how stablecoins offer a low-cost and reliable way to transfer value, contributing to financial inclusion and accessibility for underserved communities.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;The successful completion of this second PoC marks an important step forward in our efforts to make cross-border payments faster, cheaper, and more accessible to people around the world.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>SCB TechX also emphasized the potential of stablecoins in increasing financial inclusion and improving access to financial services for individuals and businesses in underserved communities.</p>

<p>This announcement is a significant milestone for the financial industry as more banks and financial institutions recognize the transformative potential of blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT) in cross-border payments.</p>



<p>Using stablecoins as a solution, banks can leverage an intermediary currency such as a dollar stablecoin to eliminate the need for maintaining accounts worldwide. This approach reduces costs by providing liquidity between local currencies and the dollar, streamlining the payment process.</p>



<p>The scalability of public blockchains and DLT is a challenge for stablecoins. <a href="https://coincu.com/172960-hedera-upgraded-the-mainnet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hedera</a>, with its EVM smart contracts, can handle 300 transactions per second. For transactions that do not require smart contracts, Hedera&#8217;s native token service can scale up to 10,000 transactions per second. The platform is also working on a hybrid version that uses smart contracts for stablecoin management by the issuer instead of every transaction.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1183.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1183-1024x538.png" alt="Shinhan Bank, SCB TechX Successfully Complete Second Stablecoin Pilot On Hedera" class="wp-image-203611" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1183-1024x538.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1183-300x158.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1183-768x403.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1183-750x394.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1183-1140x599.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1183.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Shinhan Bank, SCB TechX Successfully Complete Second Stablecoin Pilot On Hedera 20"></a></figure></div>


<p>Stablecoin usage has predominantly been for crypto transactions and P2P payments. The average cost of remittances worldwide is around 6%, but it varies significantly across jurisdictions. Low-cost networks like Hedera enable transactions at a fraction of a cent, reducing the overall payment costs.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>SEC accepts Valkyrie&#8217;s spot Bitcoin ETF application, marking progress in the review process.</em></li>



<li><em><i>The public</i> comment period opens for feedback before the official review begins.</em></li>



<li><em>Acceptance of Bitcoin ETF applications by the SEC suggests increased adoption and potential mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has recently <a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nasdaq/2023/34-97922.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acknowledged</a> the filing of Valkyrie&#8217;s spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) application, marking another significant development in the pursuit of a Bitcoin ETF.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1176-1024x576.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1176-1024x576.png" alt="SEC Now Accepts Valkyrie&#039;s Spot Bitcoin ETF Application" class="wp-image-203593" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1176-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1176-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1176-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1176-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1176-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1176.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="SEC Now Accepts Valkyrie&#039;s Spot Bitcoin ETF Application 21"></a></figure></div>


<p>This acknowledgment comes as the SEC <a href="https://coincu.com/202973-sec-now-acknowledges-blackrock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continues</a> its comprehensive review process for various ETF proposals.</p>



<p>Valkyrie&#8217;s proposal, outlined in an official filing on July 17, seeks a rule change to list and trade a spot Bitcoin ETF on Nasdaq. As part of the regulatory process, the SEC has opened a public comment period, allowing interested parties to provide feedback within 21 days after publication in the Federal Register. This period of public input is an important step before the SEC proceeds with its official review and evaluation.</p>



<p>Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at <em>Bloomberg</em>, <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1681062886808879104" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> the acceptance of Valkyrie&#8217;s spot Bitcoin ETF application by the SEC. Notably, Valkyrie was the final applicant to submit a spot Bitcoin ETF proposal amid a recent surge of applications. Balchunas also highlighted that Valkyrie has chosen the ticker symbol &#8220;BRRR&#8221; for the Bitcoin ETF on the Nasdaq exchange.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1179-1024x683.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1179-1024x683.png" alt="SEC Now Accepts Valkyrie&#039;s Spot Bitcoin ETF Application" class="wp-image-203596" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1179-1024x683.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1179-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1179-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1179-750x500.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1179-1140x760.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1179.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="SEC Now Accepts Valkyrie&#039;s Spot Bitcoin ETF Application 22"></a></figure></div>


<p>This move by the SEC to accept Valkyrie&#8217;s spot Bitcoin ETF application indicates a growing interest and recognition of the potential benefits of such investment products. Several prominent firms, including BlackRock, VanEck, Invesco, <a href="https://coincu.com/202622-fidelity-fires-up-bitcoin-etf-race/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fidelity</a>, and WisdomTree, have also entered the race to secure SEC approval for their <a href="https://coincu.com/202636-sec-now-reviews-bitwise-bitcoin-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin ETF</a> proposals. The increased attention from major financial players highlights the growing acceptance and adoption of Bitcoin in traditional investment vehicles.</p>



<p>The potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF holds significant implications for the cryptocurrency market. A spot ETF would involve the purchase and custody of actual Bitcoin, with its price linked to the current market spot price. If a Bitcoin spot ETF receives approval from regulatory bodies like the SEC, it would signify a major step toward mainstream acceptance and legitimacy for Bitcoin. Furthermore, the approval could lead to an influx of institutional capital into the cryptocurrency market, bolstering its liquidity and overall growth.</p>

<p>The positive market response to the filing of spot Bitcoin ETFs can already be observed in the price movements of Bitcoin. Following the announcement of the spot Bitcoin ETF filing by BlackRock, Bitcoin experienced a price rally that pushed it above the $30,000 level. Investors are now eagerly awaiting updates on the progress of Bitcoin ETF applications as they anticipate the potential for increased accessibility and institutional participation in the cryptocurrency market.</p>



<p>Overall, the acceptance of Valkyrie&#8217;s spot Bitcoin ETF application by the SEC, along with the growing number of similar proposals, reflects a notable shift in the regulatory landscape toward embracing digital assets. While the SEC&#8217;s review process is ongoing, these developments indicate a growing recognition of the value and potential of Bitcoin ETFs, bringing the cryptocurrency market one step closer to broader acceptance and integration within traditional investment frameworks.</p>
