<ul><li>Curve DAO token (CRV) will deploy on BNB Chain as part of the deal with Binance Labs, the company’s incubation and venture capital arm.</li><li>The $5 million investment follows brief concerns about the DeFi stableswap exchange after exploiters drained over $70 million from CRV and ETH pools.</li><li>Recovery efforts have been largely successful, with white hackers and protocols recovering three-quarters of the stolen assets.</li><li>Security veterans also proposed a collaborative initiative to provide emergency assistance given DeFi’s recent hacks.</li></ul>



<p>Binance Labs, the crypto exchange&#8217;s venture capitalist and incubator arm, plans to invest $5 million in CRV, Curve DAO&#8217;s token and a widely used crypto in Ethereum&#8217;s decentralized finance ecosystem. CRV will also deploy on BNB Chain as part of the agreement.</p>



<p>With $2.4 billion in total value locked (TVL) per DeFiLlama, Curve is comfortably DeFi&#8217;S second-largest exchange and the largest stableswap platform for decentralized participants. Binance said the commitment to CRV directly helps to shape DeFi&#8217;s future and propel growth within the industry, <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/binance-labs-invests-$5m-in-curve-dao-token-crv-and-supports-curve-deployment-to-bnb-chain-4372009526169554266" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/binance-labs-invests-$5m-in-curve-dao-token-crv-and-supports-curve-deployment-to-bnb-chain-4372009526169554266" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">added</a> Co-Founder of Binance and Head of Binance Labs Yi He. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Curve is the largest stableswap, and as a key protocol in DeFi it has contributed to the steady growth of the space in 2023. Given the recent events that have impacted the protocol, Binance Labs has offered our full support to Curve through our investment and strategic collaboration.</p></blockquote>



<h2>SEAL 911 Assembled Amid Curve Recovery</h2>



<p>Nearly two weeks after a reentrancy exploit, Curve Finance has recovered roughly three-quarters of ~ $70 million drained from liquidity pools on the platform. Affected protocols like Alchemix either had the stolen funds <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/52-million-recovered-curve-finance-heist/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/52-million-recovered-curve-finance-heist/">returned</a> by exploiters or recovered by white hat hackers. </p>



<p>Curve Finance is yet to recover assets from the CRV/ETH pools at the time of writing. The protocol put out a bounty of $1.8 million, around 10% of the outstanding funds, for any information on the exploiters&#8217; identity. </p>



<p>The incident also galvanized a collaborative initiative comprised of white hat hackers, auditors, and security experts. SEAL 911, a telegram chatbot <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/curve-defi-first-responder-telegram-bot/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/curve-defi-first-responder-telegram-bot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> by Paradigm head of security Sam (@samczsun) connects any user to a pool of vetted professionals offering assistance in emergency cases like the hacks on CRV pools and Euler. </p>

<p>Base, the L2 Ethereum network backed and built by crypto exchange Coinbase, is officially open for public access. </p>



<p>100 decentralized apps and crypto service providers like Chainlink are available on the blockchain at launch. Moreover, Base features an official <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-ethereum-bridge-nft-base/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-ethereum-bridge-nft-base/" rel="noreferrer noopener">bridge</a> to Ethereum&#8217;s mainnet allowing users to freely move ETH between both networks.</p>



<p>The launch of Base also coincides with the company&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/BuildOnBase/status/1689315339006574592?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/BuildOnBase/status/1689315339006574592?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Onchain Summer</a>&#8221; week-long event featuring commemorative NFTs and rewards for users. </p>



<p>Coinbase is the first-ever publicly traded entity in the U.S. to launch its own decentralized network. The company does not plan to launch a token for its Base L2 blockchain. </p>



<h2>Coinbase&#8217;s Secret Plan</h2>



<p>The decentralized network developed using Optimism&#8217;s OP stack is part of &#8220;The Coinbase Secret Master Plan&#8221;, said CEO Brian Armstrong when Base was announced back in February. </p>



<p>By mid July, would-be early users trooped into Base despite the network being only accessible to developers at the time. Several &#8220;degens&#8221; bridged their Ether (ETH) tokens to the network through a portal proxy contract, a one-way door from Ethereum&#8217;s ecosystem to Base. The gateway allowed these users to make millions overnight aping into risky memecoins like <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/degens-rugpull-bald-devs-pull-liquidity/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/degens-rugpull-bald-devs-pull-liquidity/" rel="noreferrer noopener">BALD</a>.</p>



<p>BALD holders however soon found themselves rekt after the token&#8217;s developer withdrew liquidity in what turned out to be a rug pull. A number of other memecoins on Base also turned out to be scams as well. At the time, Base users only had access to a one-way bridge, leaving liquidity trapped in the budding ecosystem. </p>

<ul><li>Aptos Labs has partnered with Microsoft to offer a new artificial intelligence-enabled chatbot, among other products.&nbsp;</li><li>The chatbot will offer data about the Aptos ecosystem and will be powered by Microsoft’s OpenAI.</li><li>The partnership will see Aptos host validator nodes on Microsoft Azure to efficiently process transactions.&nbsp;</li><li>The layer 1 blockchain’s native token APT gained more than 17% following the partnership’s announcement.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Layer 1 blockchain Aptos Labs has announced a partnership with tech giant Microsoft to leverage each other’s infrastructure and roll out new products. The partnership will also see both firms explore blockchain-based use cases, including asset tokenization, central bank digital currencies (<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/central-bank-mas-standard-cbdc-stablecoin/">CBDCs</a>), and digital payment, among others. </p>



<h2><strong>Aptos Assistant: AI-Powered Chatbot for Aptos Ecosystem</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/08/09/microsoft-aptos-labs-ai-blockchain-partnership-github-copilot-aptos-assistant-chatgpt/" rel="nofollow noopener">Fortune</a>, Aptos will collaborate with Microsoft Azure’s OpenAI service to develop an artificial intelligence-powered chatbot similar to OpenAI’s popular ChatGPT. The new chatbot, Aptos Assistant, will help users and developers access data and information about the Aptos ecosystem. </p>



<p>As part of the partnership, Aptos will run validator nodes on Microsoft Azure for efficient transactions and better security of the network. The layer-1 blockchain will also integrate its programming language, Move, with the Microsoft-owned coding platform GitHub. Move will specifically be integrated with Github’s Copilot, which is an AI-enabled tool that helps developers by auto-completing codes.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The intersection of AI and blockchain is one of the most interesting combinations of emerging technologies. By fusing Aptos Labs’ technology with the Microsoft Azure Open AI Service capabilities, we aim to democratize the use of blockchain.” </p><cite>Rashmi Misra, GM of AI &amp; Emerging Tech at Microsoft</cite></blockquote>



<p>Additionally, a team of developers from Aptos will directly collaborate with Microsoft’s AI professionals to train the tech giant’s AI models using Aptos’ verified blockchain information. As part of the partnership, Microsoft will open the door for large financial institutions to explore blockchain solutions with Aptos.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mo Sheikh, the Chief Executive of Aptos Labs, stated that the partnership with Microsoft is part of a larger vision between the companies. “We didn’t want to go off onto the side and just hack something together just for the hype of A.I. We wanted that deep integration and co-development,” Sheikh added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>APT, the native token of the Aptos blockchain, surged more than 17% after news of the partnership with Microsoft broke. At the time of writing, APT was trading at $7.84.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gemini has hinted at relisting XRP on its trading platform. In two separate crypto tweets, the Winklevoss-owned crypto exchange indicated that it would be relisting the token soon. The relisting tease comes less than a month after a federal judge in New York ruled that XRP’s sales to retail investors on secondary markets did not qualify as an investment contract, handing a major victory to Ripple.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>XRP’s Rally Liquidates Short Positions Worth $2.4 Million </strong></h2>



<p>Gemini’s official X (Twitter) account posted a <a href="https://twitter.com/Gemini/status/1688661246231359490" rel="nofollow noopener">meme</a> earlier today which read, “Me, the intern, patiently waiting for<a href="https://twitter.com/Gemini" rel="nofollow noopener"> @Gemini</a> to list XRP.” The online crypto community interpreted it as a hint of XRP’s impending relisting. A few hours later, the crypto exchange tweeted another XRP-themed message, which reinforced the speculation about the token’s relisting. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">xpressing xcitement about xrp</p>&mdash; Gemini (@Gemini) <a href="https://twitter.com/Gemini/status/1689016349962420224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">August 8, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The speculation surrounding XRP’s relisting on Gemini has led to a rally of more than 4.7%. The token went from $0.61 to $0.64 in less than 24 hours. The rally also prompted a visible uptick in the token’s daily trading volume, as well as its market capitalization. Data from the on-chain analytics platform Coinglass showed that the surge in XRP’s price also caused the liquidation of short positions worth over $2.4 million over the past 24 hours. </p>

<p>Gemini previously announced that it was exploring relisting XRP for both spot and derivatives trading. The announcement came on July 13 following the <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwon-dismiss-sec-lawsuit-ripple-ruling/">summary judgment</a> in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s lawsuit against Ripple. In the aftermath of the summary judgment, leading crypto exchanges, including Coinbase, Kraken, and Crypto.com, announced that they would reverse the decision to suspend XRP’s trading and relist the cryptocurrency. </p>



<p>The token was delisted from several exchanges after the SEC sued Ripple in December 2020, accusing the blockchain firm of conducting a $1.3 billion unregistered securities offering.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While last year’s downtimes and the seven major exploits the chain experienced in 2022 led to a severe decline in its TVL, the year so far has been different. Per <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Solana" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Messari</a>, Solana’s TVL at the beginning of the year was $209.25 million. Growing by 217% since then, the Layer 1 (L1) network’s TVL was $664 million at press time. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Solana registered a TVL uptick in the last month, other top L1 networks Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Avalanche, saw respective declines of 13%, 6%, and 10%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regarding Layer 2 (L2) scaling solutions, Arbitrum saw its TVL fall by 7% in the last month. Optimism, however, fared better as the rollup network logged a 10% jump in its TVL during the same period. </span></p>
<h4><b>State of Solana</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite registering a TVL growth in the last month, user activity on Solana suffered a shortfall. Per data from </span><a href="https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/projects/solana" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Token Terminal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the network registered a 5% decline in active user count in the past 30 days. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For context, user activity on the chain has been on a steady decline in the last year, primarily due to the several downtimes and exploits the network suffered during that period. In the past 180 days, daily active user count dropped by 15%. In the last 12 months, this fell by over 50%.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 1.6% drop in active user activity on Solana last week reduced trading volume across the decentralized exchanges hosted on the chain. zkSync, with a much lower TVL, exceeded Solana in DEX volume during that period, on-chain data revealed.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, a silver lining exists. While user activity and trading volume suffered a decline, Solana’s transaction fees and network revenue surged. Per data from <a href="https://analytics.solscan.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Solscan</a>, network fees charged for successful non-vote transactions climbed to a high of 53.06 SOL on 2 August. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it has since declined, this represented a significant growth in network fees from 31.64 SOL recorded a month ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A broader assessment of all network fees revealed a 50% jump in the last month. Solana also saw a corresponding hike in revenue during the same period. On an annualized basis, the L1’s revenue has gone up by 21%.</span></p>

<p>Ryan Salame, the former Co-Chief Executive of FTX Digital Markets, has reportedly held talks with federal prosecutors regarding a plea deal in connection with the charges stemming from the crypto exchange’s collapse. News of the plea deal negotiation comes more than three months after the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/fbi-raids-former-ftx-ryan-salames-house/">raided</a> Salame’s house in Potomac, Maryland. </p>



<h2><strong>FTX’s Ryan Salame Could Plead Guilty Next Month</strong></h2>



<p>People familiar with the matter revealed that Ryan Salame could plead guilty to charges related to FTX as soon as next month, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-08/ex-ftx-executive-salame-talking-to-prosecutors-about-plea-deal#xj4y7vzkg" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a> reported earlier today. The charges will likely include criminal offenses in relation to the bankrupt crypto exchange and campaign finance law violations. Salame is one of the few executives who haven’t faced any charges following FTX’s collapse in November last year. </p>



<p>It is unclear if the former FTX executive’s plea deal with the Department of Justice would require him to testify against his former boss Sam Bankman-Fried, who is facing multiple charges, including wire fraud, securities fraud, bribery allegations, campaign finance laws violations, etc. Salame’s former co-workers, including ex-Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison and FTX co-founder Gary Wang, have already entered plea agreements with the Justice Department and will testify in the lawsuit against Bankman-Fried.</p>



<p>Salame was known to be a prolific political donor and previously made headlines for donating as much as $24 million to Republican candidates in the United States. His political campaign contributions came under scrutiny last month after federal prosecutors initiated an investigation over potential campaign finance laws violations in relation to the political campaign of his girlfriend, Michelle Bond, who was a congressional candidate in 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These are all great changes that will benefit RLB holders. The staking program will give RLB holders a way to earn passive income, the airdrop program will give everyone a chance to get some free RLB tokens, and the liquidity mining program will help to increase the liquidity of RLB tokens on decentralized exchanges.</p>



<h2><strong>RLB Token Price Soars 65% on News of Revamped Tokenomics</strong></h2>



<p>The price of RLB tokens has soared by 65% in the wake of news of Rollbit&#8217;s revamped tokenomics.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of daily active addresses that trade Bitcoin [BTC] has surged in August, reaching a three-month high of 1.07 million on 2 August, data from Santiment showed.

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the number of daily active BTC addresses increases, the number of transactions involving the cryptocurrency that has resulted in losses has also grown. An examination of the coin’s ratio of daily on-chain transaction volume in profit to loss revealed this. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This indicator measures the value of an asset’s transactions that return profits to the value of its transactions resulting in a loss within a single day. When the indicator logs an uptick and is above the zero line, market participants are making more profits than losses. Conversely, market participants are recording more losses when this metric returns a value below zero. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BTC’s ratio of daily on-chain transaction volume in profit to loss was -0.161 at press time, suggesting that more BTC trades returned losses at the time of writing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, weighted sentiment remains negative as the coin continues to linger in a narrow price range. Per Santiment, BTC’s weighted sentiment was -0.25 at press time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Santiment:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This utility increase, combined with major loss transactions &amp; negative sentiment, is a strong sign that a short-term (at minimum) $BTC price bounce is more probable.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But is the king coin ready for such a leap?</span></p>
<h4><b>Finally, a reason to smile?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite facing strong resistance at $30,000 and trading in a tight range for the past two months, BTC holders have been reluctant to sell their coins, according to an analysis of exchange activity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A look at its exchange reserves on a 30-day moving average revealed a 1.4% decline in the last month. This metric tracks the total number of BTCs held within cryptocurrency exchanges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the value of BTC’s exchange reserves rises, it indicates higher selling pressure as more coins are being forwarded to exchanges for onward sales. On the other hand, a decline suggests a reduction in BTC distribution and is often a precursor to a price uptick. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition the declining number of  BTC sell-offs, most traders are betting on a price increase.. This is evident from the funding rates on the futures market across leading exchanges, which show that longs outnumber shorts. This is a positive sign, as it suggests that many traders believe that the price of Bitcoin will rise in the short term.</span></p>

<p>While these on-chain indicators hint at a price growth in the short-term, it remains important to pay attention to macro factors that might affect BTC&#8217;s price negatively.</p>

<ul><li>Core Scientific is poised to exit its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings following a $77 million deal with Bitmain.&nbsp;</li><li>Bitmain will acquire a $54 million stake in the bankrupt Bitcoin miner in exchange for 27,000 Antminers.&nbsp;</li><li>Crypto platform Anchorage Digital will also take a multi-million dollar stake in the Bitcoin mining firm.&nbsp;</li><li>Core Scientific’s share price gained more than 4% following the latest developments.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Core Scientific, the largest publicly listed crypto mining firm by hashrate, is set to exit its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings following a $77 million deal with the world’s largest crypto mining equipment maker Bitmain. The deal was disclosed in a <a href="https://cases.stretto.com/public/X217/12024/PLEADINGS/1202408082380000000050.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">filing</a> with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas earlier today.</p>



<h2><strong>Core Scientific (CORZ) Stock Gains 4%</strong></h2>



<p>As per the latest court filing, <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/core-scientific-new-contracts-bankruptcy/">Core Scientific</a> has entered into an agreement to acquire 27,000 of Bitmain’s Antminer S19j XP mining rigs for $77.1 million. In exchange for the miners, Bitmain will receive $23 million cash and equity worth $54 million in the Texas-based crypto mining giant. </p>



<p>Crypto platform Anchorage Digital, which is owed $29 million by Core Scientific, will have its claim completely converted into equity in the restructured company. The other option for creditors of the bankrupt crypto miner is to take on secured debt at 80% of the value of their claims.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Creditors, including BlockFi, Barings, MassMutual Asset Finance, BaringsTrinity Capital, and 36th Street Capital Partners, are reportedly going to take on secured debt in the emerging company. When Core filed for bankruptcy in December last year, these creditors held a debt exposure of approximately $193 million.&nbsp;</p>



<p>B.Riley, which extended a loan of $70 million to Core Scientific as part of a bankruptcy financing deal earlier this year, is expected to provide $25 million in new financing. The investment bank will also convert the outstanding amount of the loan to a delayed term loan. The bankrupt crypto miner is also negotiating a $55 million equity rights offering for common stockholders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reorganization plan is largely contingent on approval from Core Scientific’s creditors as well as the relevant bankruptcy court. The latest developments led to a 4% hike in the company’s share price. At the time of writing, Core’s stock was trading at $0.95.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Binance can now offer fully regulated Bitcoin and digital asset services in El Salvador after securing two licenses from the country&#8217;s central bank and digital assets regulators. </p>



<p>The company said in an <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/binance-becomes-first-fully-licensed-crypto-exchange-in-el-salvador-348306456147004721" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/binance-becomes-first-fully-licensed-crypto-exchange-in-el-salvador-348306456147004721" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official announcement</a> that it received a Bitcoin Services Provider license (BSP) from the Central Reserve Bank (Banco Central de Reserva) and the first non-provisional Digital Assets Services Provider license (DASP) from the National Commission of Digital Assets (Comisión Nacional de Activos Digitales). </p>



<p>Min Lin, Binance Head of Latin America said both licenses were secured after months of hard work and liaising with local regulators. Indeed, Binance had a presence in El Salvador but only through a third-party entity. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We are grateful to the Central Reserve Bank and the National Commission of Digital Assets. Their blockchain technology adoption has created a thriving sector in El Salvador that proves security and innovation are complementary assets. Now, it joins countries around the world that have granted Binance a regulatory license.</p></blockquote>



<p>Approval in El Salvador marks the 18th market to welcome Binance and issue a crypto license to the company. </p>



<h2>El Salvador&#8217;s Nascent Crypto Economy</h2>



<p>El Salvador became the first country in the world to approve Bitcoin as a legal tender. At the time, President Nayib Bukele drew scrutiny from international regulators like the IMF for legalizing the so-called digital gold. </p>



<p>Two years later, President Bukele signed the Digital Securities Act into law, further solidifying his administration&#8217;s crypto-savvy approach. The country is also exploring volcanic energy as a power source for <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/tether-el-salvador-1-billion-btc-mining/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/tether-el-salvador-1-billion-btc-mining/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin mining</a>. </p>



<p>Bitfinex Securities &#8211; an exchange offering tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) &#8211; received a provisional Digital Assets Services Provider license in April as the country continues to open its borders for crypto businesses. </p>
