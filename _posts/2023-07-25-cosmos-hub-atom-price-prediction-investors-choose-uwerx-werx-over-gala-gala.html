<p class="s5">Uwerx is a soon-to-launch blockchain-based freelance project that has quickly become the most sought-after project by investors. Since the start of its presale, Uwerx's innovative features have propelled it forward. </p>
<p class="s5">The project has continued to sell out fast at each presale, leading the developers to increase the token allocations to accommodate more users. </p>
<p class="s5">This article will examine Uwerx's success and highlight what analysts predict for Cosmos Hub (ATOM) and &nbsp;Gala (GALA). </p>
Can Uwerx (WERX) Continue On Its Winning Path?
<p class="s5">Despite being only two months into its presale, Uwerx has recorded huge wins. These wins have attracted 5,546 signups, 1,620 Twitter followers, and 1,685 Telegram members to the project. Priced at just $0.041/WERX, Uwerx has become a great opportunity for investors to make massive profits in the coin market. </p>
<p class="s5">The project is gearing up to run a test airdrop which experts believe will further engage Uwerxholders. This test airdrop was voted for by 98.2% of the Uwerx community, and the Uwerx team considers it a means to ensure that users entered the correct Receiving Wallet addresses.</p>
<p class="s5">Uwerx's presale exceeded everyone's expectations, leading the Uwerx team to modify the project's token allocation. Uwerx now offers 57% of the 750 million total token supply, representing 427,500,000 tokens. The team also increased the project's launch price to $0.095 - $0.115. </p>
<p class="s5">Uwerx's presale success is primarily due to the agile methodology approach that its developers adopted. It allowed them to release Uwerx in stages while making improvements with time.</p>
<p class="s5">Committed to serving its community, the Uwerx team locked developers' liquidity for 25 years on June 7, 2023, following 82.8% of the Uwerx community voting for it.</p>
<p class="s5">Uwerx aims to revolutionize the freelance industry by offering decentralization and low transaction fees at a 1% rate compared to traditional freelance platforms. It will offer transparent pricing, innovative earning opportunities, collaborative tools, and faster transactions. These features have set Uwerx apart and positioned it as the best option in the ever-growing freelancing industry. </p>
<p class="s5">According to a 2022 Forbes survey, 80% of U.S. employees are attracted to freelancing. This suggests that the freelance market will receive an influx of new freelancers, and Uwerx aims to get a huge share of that market.</p>
<p class="s5">The Uwerx team also introduced a feature called the Uwerx Vault. This feature allows users to save WERX tokens for a desired period. </p>
<p class="s5">Additionally, Uwerx has already launched the Alpha Version of its platform, giving users access to some of its key features, including the Landing, Sign-up, Login, Forgot Password, Hiring Dashboard, Freelancer/Client Initiation, The Initial Step of Job Creation and Initial Step of Finding Talent, My Activity, and Job Creation Process pages. </p>
<p class="s5">The team has announced that they will be launching additional functionalities soon. This has caused excitement among users already anticipating the release of the platform's Beta version. Additionally, the latest news that the team will introduce referral bonuses soon has added to investors' excitement.</p>
<p class="s5">Uwerx urges users to share their suggestions and recommendations through the dedicated email address feedback@uwerx.network. This will enable users to contribute to enhancing the platform.</p>
Investors Are Unsure If Cosmos Hub (ATOM) Will Rise Again
<p class="s5">Since 2021, Cosmos Hub (ATOM) has been making considerable progress in the coin market. However, the project has been falling in the last one month. Cosmos Hub (ATOM) is trading at $10.21, representing a -21.51 decline in the past month. The story has been the same for the last seven days as Cosmos Hub (ATOM) declined by -6.79. </p>
<p class="s5">The main aim of Cosmos Hub (ATOM) is to facilitate faster, cheaper and more scalable transactions. The project focuses on sovereignty and sustainability and facilitates interoperability between blockchains. </p>
<p class="s5">Cosmos Hub (ATOM) recorded important partnerships last month, notably with Stride. This partnership with Stride saw Cosmos Hub (ATOM) taking home 15% of STRD inflationary staking rewards, 15% of transaction fees and 15% of MEV revenue. </p>
<p class="s5">As Cosmos Hub (ATOM) enters the second week of June, holders expect more partnerships which could drive the price of Cosmos Hub up. Analysts predict the project will trade at $19.31 by the second quarter of 2024. </p>
How Will Gala (GALA) Perform This Month
<p class="s5">Last month was an eventful one for Gala (GALA). The project released the second version of the GALA token, which brought in more investors. Gala (GALA) also partnered with BitkubAcademy to develop educational content in the Web 3.0 industry. They also conducted the V2 airdrop and burned almost 21 billion GALA (GALA) tokens worth more than $637 million. These moves put investors' minds at ease and renewed their trust in the Gala (GALA) project. </p>
<p class="s5">Also in May, Gala Games partnered with PokerGo to build a Web3 social poker game. Gala (GALA) holders believe this partnership will lead to more exposure for Gala (GALA). </p>
<p class="s5">Despite these developments, Gala (GALA) entered the month of June declining in price. The project decreased by -37.8% in the last month. Gala (GALA) trades at $0.028, representing a 4.82% increase in the past 24hrs. Analysts predict the project will reach $0.051 by the second quarter of 2024.</p>
<p class="s5">This prediction is very little compared to what analysts predict for Uwerx. They are convinced that Uwerx has what it takes to surpass $2.50 by January 2024. As such, many investors are rushing to buy WERX tokens for the low price of $0.05245. </p>
<p class="s5">Knowing that the project has undergone InterFi Network and SolidProof audits, investors are confident that their funds are safe.</p>
