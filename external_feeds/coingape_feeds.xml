Additionally, the time given for the development of these projects is a resource that can be considered quite pricey, as projects garnering a large number of developers who volunteer their time &amp; expertise might indicate towards the project&#8217;s overall positive growth.</p>
<h2>5 Cryptos With Highest Development</h2>
<p>According to the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1617932609602088960" rel="nofollow">data</a> provided by Santiment, <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/polkadot/">Polkadot (DOT)</a> and <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/kusama/">Kusama (KSM)</a> share the lead for the most development activity on GitHub as of the 25th of January. Operating on a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos/#:~:text=Proof%20of%20Stake%20is%20a,them%20to%20the%20existing%20blockchain.">proof-of-stake</a> mechanism, Cardano (ADA) with a score of 337, came in at number three in terms of its development activity.</p>
<p>GitHub, for the unaware, is a cutting-edge software that facilitates collaboration between individual programmers and groups of programmers working on a single project. The use of this platform in the crypto sector has been on the rise, and it is used by a wide range of people from coding specialists to beginners throughout the world. For instance, this system is used by all emerging crypto initiatives to facilitate the linking of disparate concepts and programs.</p>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/decentraland/">Decentraland (MANA)</a>, Status (SNT), and <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/cosmos/">Cosmos (ATOM)</a> rounded out the top five cryptos by virtue of their development activity recorded on Github. Meanwhile, Filecoin (FIL), Internet Computer (ICP), Ethereum (ETH), and Concordium (CCD) concluded the list of top 10 <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrencies</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-136636" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/25014709/Screenshot-2023-01-25-013822-1.png" alt="" width="1277" height="897" /></p>

<h2>Token Price Mimics Dev Activity?</h2>
<p>However, it&#8217;s to be noted that, Kusama is Polkadot&#8217;s sister chain for experimental development and early-stage deployments, and therefore shares the same score for development activity. <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cardano/">Cardano</a>, on the other hand, has maintained its top three spot consecutively for the past few months. This has also reflected positively on <a href="https://coingape.com/price/cardano/">Cardano&#8217;s (ADA) price</a>, which has seen a rise of roughly 50% in the past 30 days and 8% in the last seven days.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-136637 size-full" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/25021138/Screenshot-2023-01-25-021125.png" alt="crypto development activity" width="892" height="647" /></p>
<p>Decentraland, a leading <a href="https://coingape.com/blog/what-is-metaverse/">Web3 metaverse</a> project, has also seen a recent price increase of 73%, which has brought the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoin</a> back to its pre-FTX collapse level. Other projects that were mentioned on the list, such as ICP, ATOM, and FIL, also witnessed significant increases in their valuations during the past few weeks, with respective increases of 53%, 45%, and 78%.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1200" height="678" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/29122310/MATIC-Price-Edges1.webp" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="MATIC polygon" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the influence of recent recovery and the formation of a double bottom pattern, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/polygon/">polygon coin price</a> managed to rebound from the $0.757 support. In the first two weeks of 2023, the coin price surged 38% higher to reach a local resistance of $1.04. During this bull run, MATIC&#8217;s price also provided a massive breakout from the $0.035 neckline resistance of the double button pattern. Here’s how this pattern may influence the MATIC coin’s future price</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intense supply pressure above $1.05 resistance indicates prolonged consolidation in polygon coin price.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The range between $0.935 and $0.87 stands as a strong support zone as crucial EMAs waver between this level</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the MATIC  is $392.5 Million, indicating a 32.6% loss.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/w/WjzAWj8L.png" alt="Polygon Coin" width="1946" height="1104" /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source- &#8211;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/double-bottom-pattern/">double bottom pattern</a> is one of the famous bullish reversal patterns which could intensify the bullish momentum and drive the asset price to higher levels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, as the market sentiment seems to halt bullish growth, price the MATIC is struggling to surpass the $1.05 barrier. Last week, the coin price showed multiple failed attempts to breach the aforementioned resistance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The several higher price rejection candles at $10.5 resistance indicate the sellers are aggressively defending this level. By the press time, the MATIC coin trades at $1.006, but if the selling pressure persists, the prices could tumble 7% to revisit the $0.935 support.</span></p>
<p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/best-telegram-crypto-channels-list/">CRYPTO TELEGRAM CHANNELS LIST 2023</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the traders can enter the retest opportunity mentioned above or wait for the $1.05 breakout. Anyhow under the influence of the double bottom pattern, the polygon coin price rise to the $1.13 mark.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicators</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>MACD</strong>: the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a>(blue) and signal(orange) line is gradually nearing a bearish crossover, encouraging a temporary pullback in MATIC price.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs</strong>: the flattish EMAs (20, 50, 100, and 200) accumulated between the 0.93 and 0.87 mark indicate a high accumulation zone for coin buyers.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Polygon Coin Price Intraday Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $1.003</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: High</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance levels- $1.06 and $1.136</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support levels- $0.935 and $0.87</span></li>

<h2>A New Celsius Token?</h2>
<p>During a video-court hearing, the attorney for the company, Ross M. Kwasteniet, stated that reorganizing Celsius into a publicly traded company that is properly licensed would bring in more money for creditors than selling assets, that are difficult to liquidate at the prices that are currently available. Any proposal for restructuring would initially be put to a vote by creditors, which would include Celsius customers who had <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> stored on the company&#8217;s platform. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn would then weigh the results of that vote while determining whether to accept the proposal or not.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://coingape.com/defi-lending-platforms/">Check Out The Top 10 DeFi Lending Platforms Of 2023</a></em></p>
<p>According to Kwastenet, after the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/crypto-lending/">crypto lending</a> giant filed for bankruptcy the previous year, the company tried to sell itself as a functioning corporation while also seeking offers for its assets. However, the bids that have been made for the individual assets are not attractive enough. Instead, Celsius has been engaged in discussions with a variety of creditor organizations on the formation of a new firm and the distribution of a new token to creditors as part of a compensation plan.</p>
<blockquote><p>It has been determined that the offers for the individual assets have not been compelling</p></blockquote>
<h2>Celsius Plans New Beginning</h2>
<p>Furthermore, Kwasteniet indicated that the corporation would submit court documents later this week that provided specifics regarding their objectives. Moreover, he added that any new business would be structured on its assets, which would comprise a portfolio of loans and other investments, in addition to tens of thousands of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-mining/">cryptocurrency mining</a> machines.</p>
<p>While speaking on the topic of crypto mining during the hearing, the company&#8217;s financial adviser highlighted that the sector has been witnessing exponential growth in the past few months.</p>

Thus, the coin price is still midway in this pattern formation, indicating there is more growth potential for this memecoin.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><b>Key points: </b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A daily candle closing above $0.00000961 may drive the coin price 8.8% higher to rechallenge the $0.0000104 barrier</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The potential bullish crossover between the 50-and-100-day EMA could assist buyers in replenishing bullish momentum. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume of the Shiba Inu coin is $302 Million, indicating a 20% loss.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/o/oZBp0FgR.png" alt="Shiba Inu coin" width="1946" height="1104" /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the new year recovery in the crypto market, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/shiba-inu/">Shiba Inu coin</a> showcased a U-shaped recovery from the 0.0000079 support. In the past three weeks, this bullish reversal has surged the coin 50% higher to currently trade at the $0.0000119 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the price rally breached multiple resistances during this journey which flipped them into suitable support for buyers to sustain higher prices. Moreover, the SHIB price has recently breached another higher resistance of $0.0000117, providing additional footing to prolong the bullish rally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, over the past four days, the coin price went sideways above the $0.0000117 mark and showed several high price rejections near the $0.0000122 mark. These higher price rejection candle projects exhausted bullish momentum after an aggressive bull run covered in a short time.</span></p>
<p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-discord-groups-servers/">Top Crypto Discord Servers/Groups Worth Joining In 2023</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, this consolidation phase is beneficial for the Shiba Inu coin to recuperate the bullish momentum. If the coin price manages to show sustainability about the breached resistance, the buyers should eventually lead the prices 17% higher to the $0.000014 neckline of the rounding bottom pattern.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a country note, if the daily candle closes below the 0.000117 support, the coin holders may witness a longer correction before the resuming recovery rally.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bollinger band</strong>: the rising SHIB price constantly moving near the upper band of this indicator accentuates an aggressive rally in the market. Therefore, a correction phase is needed for this memecoin to neutralize the excessive buying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>RSI</strong>: The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rounding-bottom-pattern/">daily RSI slope</a> reverted from the overbought region, indicating the coin price is in the process of stabilizing the bullish trend.</span></p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot price: $0.0000119</span></li>

Although the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoin</a> recorded a significant price rise since New Year&#8217;s, it is still not up to the mark when compared with other cryptocurrencies. The year 2022 turned out to be remarkable for Polygon with several successful partnerships and progress on the development front. However, if the crypto rally continues, it is speculated that MATIC price could pick up in coming weeks.</p>

<h2>Gaming Platform Moves To Polygon Network</h2>
<p>In a latest, web 3.0 based gaming platform Fractal said it was expanding to the Polygon network. The expansion will allow <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/Kingdomverse_/status/1613747791800504320?s=20&amp;t=OgzU1PbpH87ejwBR9mwXqg" rel="nofollow">Fractal</a> based mints, tournaments, marketplace, and studio to be accessed on Polygon. Meanwhile, MATIC is yet to break resistance in the current range at the $1.30 level. According to <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HklxljvK3Ls" rel="nofollow">Crypto Banter</a>, the altcoin is currently trading between the mid level and range high and chances are MATIC could breach resistance. As of writing, the MATIC price stands at $0.999895, up by nearly 1% in the last 24 hours, according to <a href="https://coingape.com/price/polygon/">CoinGape</a> price tracker.</p>
<p>On the other side, data from <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://insights.santiment.net/read/the-pump-hunter-s-guide-how-to-spot-and-profit-from-artificially-inflated-crypto-prices-7186" rel="nofollow">Santiment Insights</a> points to a potential bull trap formation in the current scenario. It is the whale selling activity as the price is on the rise that suggests there could be <a href="https://coingape.com/education/what-is-bull-trap-in-crypto/">bull trap</a> at play. In the case of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC), the number of addresses holding huge bags of assets are on a decline while the price increased. This could potentially mean that the whales are selling their holdings while price rose.</p>

The <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/">price of Bitcoin (BTC)</a>, the largest cryptocurrency by <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/market-capitalization/#:~:text=The%20term%20market%20capitalization%20or,coin%20at%20any%20given%20time.">market cap</a>, has risen by almost 40% to breach the $23,000 level in January, indicating a substantial surge for the asset. This marks the highest gain for Bitcoin since October of 2021.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin (BTC) Price Surge</h2>
<p>The recent price surge has caused many prominent analysts to focus on greater values, which were last seen in the mid of 2022. However, they also forecast further gains based on the sentiment of traditional risk assets which sometimes act as a catalyst to the price of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>. According to crypto <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/GameofTrades_/status/1617884933233541120" rel="nofollow">research</a> conducted by Game of Trades, BTC is racing towards a major breakout on its 1-year chart, with the likely prospect of hitting $46,100 sooner than it was initially anticipated. This would come after first breaking resistance levels located at $25,000 and $32,000.</p>
<p>A price is considered to be at a resistance level when there is a reasonable expectation that supply will be strong enough to prevent further price increases.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-136626" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/24220049/Screenshot-2023-01-24-220033.png" alt="" width="1609" height="892" /></p>
<p>The rebound is strong given that it has overcome significant resistance levels despite continuing worries about the effects of the collapse of the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">crypto exchange</a> <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a>. And although a rally toward $25,000 is possible, it may be contingent on traditional risk assets, which are led by bluechip technology companies. As per market experts, these traditional risk assets have regained their footing over the course of the last two trading days as fears of a recession have subsided while the Federal Reserve is expected to be less hawkish. The government body is expected to hike interest rates on February 1 by only 25 basis points, according to speculators.</p>

<h2>BTC Bullish Sentiment Intact</h2>
<p>According to a report that was published earlier on CoinGape, there are other analysts who have voiced the same opinion on the price of Bitcoin (BTC). One such analyst is the well-known <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> analyst Michael van de Poppe, who predicts that the price of the flagship digital asset could <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-btc-price-gunning-for-35000/">reach as high as $35,000</a> in the coming few months.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-136627 size-full" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/24221753/Screenshot-2023-01-24-221740.png" alt="Bitcoin (BTC) Price" width="915" height="661" /></p>
<p>According to data that was obtained at the time of writing, the overall <a href="https://coingape.com/markets">cryptocurrency market</a> had increased by 0.56%, bringing its value to $1.05 trillion. In addition, the total volume of trades executed increased by 5.85%, reaching almost $56.55 billion. <span id="inputElements~dce916a38741450f" class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit css-1uk1gs8">As things stand, the Bitcoin (BTC) price is currently exchanging hands at $22,959.</span><span id="inputElements~821cca2d8e5ecb60" class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit css-1uk1gs8"> This represents an increase of 0.20% on the day, in contrast to a gain of 8% during the week as per CoinGape’s crypto market tracker.</span></p>

Though this newly reclaimed level should have offered coin buyers a suitable footing to lead further rallies, the coin price is struggling to sustain at higher levels. The BTC price getting rejection at the $23000 mark indicates an upcoming correction phase.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiple rejection candles at $23000 suggest may the BTC price struggle to sustain the recent breakout </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish crossover between the 50 and 100 may assist traders in keeping bullish sentiment intact.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Bitcoin is $16.2 Billion, indicating a 1.5% loss</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/1/1FTfl7tu.png" alt="Bitcoin Price" width="1946" height="1104" />Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bitcoin price showcased a parabolic growth since the beginning of 2023, accounting for a 38% rally so far. During the bullish rally, the coin price breached several resistances, with growing volume indicating a sustained recovery phase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, on January 20th, the BTC price witnessed a significant inflow and breached the latest horizontal barrier of $22500. This resistance breakout should have accelerated bullish momentum to encourage further growth, but it seems the sellers are actively defending the higher prices.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past few days, the Bitcoin price has shown multiple higher price rejections at the $23000 mark. These daily rejection candles project exhausted bullish momentum and early profit booking from temporary traders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By press time, the Bitcoin price trades at $22833, within an intraday loss of 0.42%. The higher price rejection attached to today&#8217;s candle indicates the selling pressure still persists. Thus, a daily candle closing below $22500 will undermine the recent breakout and signal a <a href="https://coingape.com/education/what-is-bull-trap-in-crypto/">bull trap.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This breakdown will trigger a temporary pullback in Bitcoin price to replenish the bullish momentum. In case of a potential pullback, the coin price will likely revisit the $21600 or $20400 support.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>RSI</strong>&#8211; The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">daily- RSI slope</a> is still wavering in the overboard region, a minor consideration or pullback to stabilize the bullish recovery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs</strong>: the 200-day main moving around the $21000 mark could assist buyers in resuming the bullish train.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin Price Intraday Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $22851</span></li>

However, following the bloodbath of crypto and the growing number of bankruptcy cases of crypto companies, the need for robust <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-regulation/">crypto regulations</a> has been voiced by many &#8212; including <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/binance/">Binance&#8217;s</a> CEO Changpeng &#8220;CZ&#8221; Zhao.</p>
<h2>Binance CEO On Crypto Regulations</h2>
<p>Speaking on the recently released 5-point crypto regulation scheme by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), CZ claims them to be highly beneficial and &#8220;good&#8221; for crypto &amp; its related businesses. According to CZ, the most effective method of user protection is risk-based regulation that is implemented on a worldwide scale. And, while talking about the potential threats of crypto facing outright bans in certain jurisdictions, he was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Outright bans will just lead to users operating in the shadows, at their own risk, and without any safety net.</p></blockquote>
<p>As highlighted by the exchange CEO, the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2023/01/18/crypto-contagion-underscores-why-global-regulators-must-act-fast-to-stem-risk" rel="nofollow">IMF</a> first wants crypto asset service providers to be licensed, registered, and authorized. This comprises businesses that offer services such as storage, transfer, exchange, settlement, and custody, and are subject to regulations that are comparable to those that control service providers in the traditional financial sector. It demands that assets belonging to customers be kept in a distinct location from those belonging to the company itself, as well as that the responsible authority is made perfectly clear.</p>
<p><strong><em>Read More: </em></strong><a href="https://coingape.com/best-telegram-crypto-channels-list/"><em>Check Out The Top Crypto Telegram Channels Of 2023</em></a></p>
<p>According to CZ, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrency</a> industry wants crypto legislation that is robust, comprehensive, and globally consistent so that it can accommodate its cross-border nature. He further stresses the fact that, in order for a global strategy to be successful, it is necessary for it to evolve along with the shifting landscape of the sector.</p>
<h2>Regulating Lending, Stablecoins &amp; More</h2>
<p>Second, organizations that perform a variety of tasks inside the cryptosphere should be subject to more regulation. Such businesses should be subject to strict restrictions on transparency so that all dependencies and operations may be properly defined. If there is any conflict of interest, it should be reviewed by the relevant authorities and prohibited, if necessary.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Good approach to crypto regulations by Bo Li &amp; Nobuyasu Sugimoto at <a href="https://twitter.com/IMFNews?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@IMFNews</a>.</p>
<p>“Stronger financial regulation &amp; supervision, &amp; developing global standards, can help address many concerns about crypto assets.”</p>
<p>Regulatory clarity is needed ASAP. Thoughts<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f9f5.png" alt="🧵" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/BBVqxDcq86">https://t.co/BBVqxDcq86</a></p>
<p>&mdash; CZ <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f536.png" alt="🔶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Binance (@cz_binance) <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1617877735233449984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 24, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Thirdly, given that an increasing number of investors are looking to <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/stablecoin/">stablecoins</a> as a form of value storage, issuers of stablecoins ought to be held to stringent prudential standards. These holdings, if not subject to appropriate scrutiny and regulation, could threaten the stability of the monetary and financial systems. In the case of significant stablecoins, a level of regulation comparable to that which is prevalent in the banking industry might be required.</p>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/tag/cz/">CZ</a> highlights as a last point of conclusion that user protection and market integrity are better when politicians and regulators broaden the scope of activities that are permitted.

The proposal aims to upgrade the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blockchain</a> from v1.0.4 to v1.0.5 and introduces codes to make future upgrades possible.</p>
<p>The upgrade also enables the Terra Grants Foundation to make the required changes suggested by <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto exchange</a> Binance to bring back the LUNC burn mechanism.</p>
<h2>Terra Classic Community Approves Crucial Proposal 11310</h2>
<p>Terra Classic core developer Edward Kim submitted Proposal 11310 last week. As part of the proposal, the Joint L1 Task Force will perform a software upgrade on the Terra Classic blockchain to transition from v1.0.4 to v1.0.5. It will make transaction fees (gas and burn tax) estimation and future chain upgrade a lot easier and smoother.</p>
<p>While there&#8217;s still a day left to vote on the proposal, the community has rushed to approve the blockchain upgrade proposal by Edward Kim. The LUNC community has always supported proposals suggested by professor Kim.</p>
<p>As per current voting details, 99.99% of voters support the proposal. It has received 46 validator votes until now and all have voted in favor of the proposal. Among the top validators, Allnodes, Interstellar Lounge, StakeBin, Luna Station 88, and <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/ClassyCrypto_/status/1616111960734539776" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Classy&#8217;s Sphere have voted</a> “Yes” to the proposal.</p>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/lunc-news-terra-classic-core-developer-edward-kim-proposal-up-for-voting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joint L1 Task Force</a> consisting of Edward Kim, Tobias “Zaradar” Anderson, and other developers will fix the node’s LCD endpoint that corrects a calculation issue on the LCD. The upgrade is scheduled to happen at block 11,543,150, expected on February 14.</p>
<p>In fact, this is the first upgrade for the Terra Classic blockchain as per the Q1 roadmap. It will be followed by v1.0.6, Cosmos SDK, Tendermint, and v2.0.4 upgrades.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it will also enable developers to make necessary changes as suggested by Binance to bring back burn. The crypto exchange temporarily <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-binance-suspends-terra-classic-lunc-burn-lunc-price-falls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suspended its LUNC burn mechanism</a> and reduced its commitment to burn 50% of the LUNC spot and margin trading fees instead of 100%. Binance may stop its LUNC burn mechanism if the Terra Classic community fails to make these changes.</p>
<h2>LUNC Price Lost Momentum?</h2>
<p>Terra Classic witnessed a massive rally recently amid renewed interest among the community members. However, the LUNC price has lost upside momentum.</p>
<p>LUNC price increased nearly 1% in the last 24 hours, with the price currently trading at $0.0001791. The 24-hour low and high are $0.0001773 and $0.0001804, respectively. Meanwhile, the trading volume has decreased by 40% in the last 24 hours, indicating a lack of interest from traders.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1200" height="630" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/08014624/ALTCOINS.jpg" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="altcoin doge" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Top Crypto Coins Ready to Skyrocket: Amid the recent new year recovery in the crypto market, a majority of coins witnessed a significant rally since January 1st. Though the market sentiment showed certain weakness last week, it seems the buyers are trying to recuperate bullish momentum before the bull run continues. Therefore, today, we have selected some of the top crypto coins following a famous bullish continuation pattern called a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/wedge-pattern/">falling wedge</a>. Here&#8217;s how this bullish pattern could assist buyers in reclaiming a higher level in the near future.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uniswap(UNI)</span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/z/zz1ZeKq5.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past five months, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/uniswap/">Uniswap token price</a> fell within two converging trendlines indicating the formation of a falling wedge pattern. Though it seems this pattern is leading a directional downtrend, in theory, a bullish breakout from its overhead trendline is the most common outlook, which signals an early sign of recovery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, with the recent recovery in the market, the Uniswap coin has given an upward breakout from the long-coming trendline on January 13th. So far, the post-breakout rally has surged the prices 10% higher, and it currently trades at $6.68. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the UNI price manages to sustain above the breached trendline, the holders could grab potential targets at $7.8, $9.6, or $12.1.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cardano(ADA)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/o/Ocyfw3Op.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://coingape.com/price/cardano/">Cardano coin price</a> has been following the wedge pattern for the past seven months and displays one of the textbook examples of this pattern. Furthermore, the coin price faced multiple resistance from the pattern downsloping trendline, indicating the traders were aggressively selling at this trendline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, on January 13th, a bullish breakout from the above trendline indicated the trader&#8217;s sentiments must be shifted from selling on the rallies to buying on dips. From the breakout point, the coin price surged 17.31% high to challenge the local resistance of $0.38.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the coin price currently trades at $0.376 and shows a power struggle to surpass mentioned resistance. Thus, if the selling pressure persists, the Cardano coin may witness a minor consolidation before the bullish rally resumes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyhow the potential target for ADA price under the influence of this pattern could be $0.42, $0.52, and $0.67</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hedera(HBAR)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/b/B57KyWLb.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In theory, the converging trendlines during the pattern formation display the failure of the coin seller to carry a deeper downfall. as a result, the buyers gradually wrestle trend controls from sellers, leading to an upward breakout from the pattern&#8217;s resistance trendline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On January 30, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/hedera-hashgraph/">Hedera coin price</a> gave a decisive break out from the dynamic resistance, which led to a post-retest rally of 47% to hit the $0.074 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By press time, the coin price trades at $0.069, witnessing a temporary correction after the major rally. Anyhow in a favorable bullish condition, the HBAR price should experience a sustained recovery to $0.08, followed by the $0.1 mark.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Polkadot(DOT)</span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/z/zS8jHuPN.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On January 14th, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/polkadot/">Polkadot coin price</a> gave a massive breakout from the eight-month-long falling wedge pattern. The post-breakout rally pushed the coin prices 16% higher, where it currently exchanges hands at the $6.5 mark. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the technical setup, the lower high tops during the pattern formation act as a potential target upon the break out of the pattern&#8217;s resistant trendline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, if the recovery sentiment in the market continues, the coin chart shows the potential target of $8, $9.7, or $11.87.</span></p>

The positive sentiment is so deeply playing out in the market that even the miners are reluctant to sell their BTC holdings. This could well be a massive bullish sign for potential upside movement in the coming weeks. This is even more important considering the upcoming <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/federal-reserve-system/">Fed</a> rate hike announcement from the February FOMC meeting.</p>
<p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/how-far-will-bitcoin-btc-rally-in-february-if-fed-pivots-rate-hike/?utm_source=24hrsupdateall">How Far Will Bitcoin (BTC) Rally In February If Fed Pivots Rate Hike?</a></p>
<p>The solid resistance to sell BTC from the miners could also be a strong signal for potential upside to the altcoins as well. The Fed&#8217;s FOMC is set to meet between January 31 and February 1, when the committee could likely raise the interest rate by 0.25%. This outcome could favor an upside move for Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins as more traders might look to enter crypto positions to protect from inflation related losses. On the other side, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) is on a downward trajectory in recent times, in what could be supportive of BTC price rise.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The selling orders from Bitcoin miners is currently at its lowest level in the recent years. While the BTC transfer volume from miners to exchanges spiked after the FTX collapse in 2022, the volume is at its lowest range since 2020. This means the miner community is sure of a further BTC price rise and look to take profits. As of writing, BTC price stands at $22,888, almost from compared to the last 24 hours, according to price tracking platform <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">CoinMarketCa</a>p.</p>

One such rivalry between Decentraland vs The Sandbox has been going on for a long time. Sandbox and <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/decentraland/">Decentraland</a> are metaverses, a form of digital worlds built on <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/">blockchain technology</a>.</p>
<p>As you know, Decentraland is the older of the two and also the pioneer of the 3D Blockchain Metaverse. But interestingly, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/sandbox/">The Sandbox</a> is considered a more detailed and concrete plan for the future than its competitor Decentraland.</p>
<p>When it comes down to the price, The Sandbox is currently trading at $0.6919 with a 24-hour trading volume of $382,027,695. On the other hand, Decentraland’s current price is $0.6534 with a 24-hour trading volume of $400,996,034. At present, there is barely a difference in their prices then the important question is, between Decentraland and The Sandbox, who will reach $1 first in 2023?</p>
<h2>Decentraland (MANA): Towards the Bullish Run</h2>
<p>Decentraland is a virtual reality platform built on the Ethereum blockchain technology. Hence, the MANA token is an ERC-20 token. MANA can be used to buy plots of land in the Decentraland marketplace, upon which they can build and monetize.</p>
<p>For MANA rates in January 2023, crypto experts expect the average to be $0.549945 based on <a href="https://coingape.com/price/decentraland/">Decentraland’s price</a> fluctuations at the beginning of 2022. There’s a minimum price of $0.49995 and a maximum price of $0.569943, respectively.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-135976" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/19121808/MANA-price.png" alt="" width="1187" height="582" /></p>
<p><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.coinskid.com/crypto/decentraland-mana/forecast/" rel="nofollow">CoinsKid</a> predicted that MANA could reach $0.9792 by November 2023 after closing at $0.4814 in 2022. Further, <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://walletinvestor.com/forecast/decentraland-prediction" rel="nofollow">WalletInvestor</a> predicted MANA would be worth $0.03 in November 2023.</p>
<p>According to Gov Capital, MANA is in its uptrend because GameFi is widespread and by the end of this year, the asset is predicted to reach a point of about $6.0.</p>

<h2>The Sandbox (SAND): One of the Biggest Play-to-earn Metaverses</h2>
<p>Sandbox is a decentralized metaverse that offers a gaming ecosystem where you can create and monetize virtual assets and gaming experiences. The Sandbox makes it easy for players to build whatever they like on their land with the VoxEdit and Game Maker tools, which offer an entire suite of world-building development tools that can produce some stunning results.</p>
<p>For the last 7 days, SAND has been in a good upward trend. The Sandbox has shown massive potential lately, creating the right opportunity to dig in and invest. Gov Capital made a <a href="https://coingape.com/price/the-sandbox/">SAND price</a> prediction that said the token could be $4.616 in a year. Its five-year forecast was $28.124.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-135977" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/19121847/SAND-Price.png" alt="" width="1178" height="581" /></p>
<p>According to the technical analysis of The Sandbox prices expected in 2023, the minimum cost of The Sandbox will be $1.08. The maximum level that the SAND price can reach is $1.26.</p>
<p><strong>Also Read:</strong> <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/sandbox-coin-may-rise-6-in-coming-week-but-heres-a-catch/">Sandbox Coin May Rise 6% In Coming Week; But Here’s A Catch</a></p>
<h2>Decentraland vs The Sandbox: Which is Better?</h2>
<p>It is difficult to say which decentralized metaverse is better at the moment. Based on the overall user accessibility, gaming focus, aesthetics, and more detailed roadmap, The Sandbox is the clear winner. But at the same time, it is still in Alpha mode and has not been as battle tested as Decentraland.</p>
<p>The latter have more experienced and decentralized platforms that tend to yield better results in such a delicate and complex arena as blockchain gaming. Meanwhile, The Sandbox has plenty of tools and intriguing artistic visuals. Both of these lead to an enjoyable experience. So, if you find it difficult to make a decision, consider trying them both and discovering which works better for you.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is important to note that price forecasts, especially for something as volatile as cryptocurrency, are not the final words, and they can change any time.</p>

<h2><strong>Details About The Error?</strong></h2>
<p>Binance-peg tokens or B-Tokens are currently stored in a single wallet called &#8216;Binance 8&#8217; which also holds customer assets. It was reported that, on Monday, as per the listings visible on its website, the wallet contains significantly more tokens in reserve than required for the amount of B-tokens issued by <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-reportedly-eliminates-dcgs-twap-trades-citing-legal-risks/">Binance</a>.</p>
<p>This suggests that the collateral is mixed with the customer&#8217;s coins and not stored separately.</p>
<h2><strong>Binance Is Fixing This Mistake</strong></h2>
<p>Binance spokesperson in a statement to Bloomberg News said that &#8220;Binance 8 is an exchange <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cold-wallet/">cold wallet</a>. Collateral assets have previously been moved into this wallet in error and referenced accordingly on the B-Token Proof of Collateral page.&#8221; It was further added that Binance is aware of this error and is in the process of moving these assets to a dedicated collateral wallet.</p>
<p>The spokesperson mentioned that user assets held with the exchange are backed 1:1. However, the Binance spokesperson did not disclose when the issue was identified. Currently, <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xf977814e90da44bfa03b6295a0616a897441acec">Binance 8</a> is the 6th largest wallet with over $2.35 billion worth of total crypto holdings.</p>

After a 40% rally in January, traders speculate whether the Bitcoin price will continue to rise and hit $25K or fall to $21K. Popular analyst Michael van de Poppe believes the rally is likely over as Bitcoin couldn&#8217;t break through a crucial resistance at $23.1K.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price Risks Falling to $21K?</h2>
<p>Bitcoin continues to move above the $23K level amid fresh investor optimism, but fails to hold the level due to crucial resistance at $23.1K.</p>
<p>Whether the current BTC price movement can bring a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bull-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bullish market</a> is still a concern. Bitcoin price keeps moving upwards and even crossed its 200-DMA, making a 40% rally in January. However, it still has no significant pullback. Therefore, investors are waiting for the pullback in BTC price.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin price would likely drop to $21k rather than $25K, the next positive level suggested by analysts, as traders&#8217; sentiment is more likely bearish in the short term.</p>
<p>Crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe in a <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1617834218276487168" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweet</a> on January 24 said Bitcoin price is facing difficulty in breaking above a crucial resistance at $23.1K. Thus, if Bitcoin continues to make lower highs, then probably test and sweep around $22.3K before continuation is more likely.</p>
<figure id="attachment_136606" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-136606" style="width: 734px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-136606" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/24180437/FnOmA-7WYAAika8.png" alt="Bitcoin Price" width="734" height="347" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-136606" class="wp-caption-text">Bitcoin Price in 1Hr Timeframe. Source: CoinGape</figcaption></figure>
<p>In addition, it will offer a good buying opportunity for investors who failed to grab Bitcoin at lower levels. In early January, Michael van de Poppe predicted a massive rally in the BTC price, which will subside before the FOMC meeting.</p>
<h2>Why Bitcoin Rally Is Likely Over</h2>
<p>CoinGape published a <a href="https://coingape.com/just-in-reasons-why-bitcoin-btc-price-rally-is-likely-over/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent analysis</a> citing reasons why the Bitcoin price rally is likely over. European Central Bank plans to deliver 50 bps interest rate hikes in February and March.</p>
<p>The U.S. <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/federal-reserve-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Reserve</a> is more likely to announce a 50 bps rate hike on February 1, as per economists. However, as per <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">CME FedWatch Tool</a>, the probability of a 25 bps rate hike is 99%.</p>

As the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/">crypto market</a> is slowly moving towards a bullish trend it becomes crucial to know which cryptocurrency is a better bet in January, 2023.</p>
<p>Right now, there are more than 20,000 coins and tokens in existence. With 20-40 new currencies getting listed every day. But not every <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrency</a> promises a bright and green future. In this article, we will discuss which cryptocurrency is best between Dogecoin and XRP, especially when both coins have demonstrated their potential for significant price growth.</p>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/tag/xrp/">XRP</a> is popularly known as the bankers&#8217; cryptocurrency. Whereas, Dogecoin is somewhat the opposite. Starting with a meme trend and reaching the new heights, DOGE is intended to be a viable means of payment for everyday retail transactions.</p>
<h2>Ripple: Towards the Bull Run</h2>
<p>Ripple (XRP)’s revolutionary technology made it a leading provider of crypto solutions for businesses. The coin, at present, is hovering around $0.4 with a 24-hour trading volume of $1,664,844,090. In the past 7 days, <a href="https://coingape.com/price/xrp-price/">XRP’s price</a> has surged up to 9.27%.</p>
<p><strong>Latest Bullish Updates:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>XRP&#8217;s bullish behavior brought a 50% price increase in the last 30 days</li>
<li>According to the most recent updates by <a href="https://twitter.com/FilanLaw/status/1616263942892064769">James K. Filan</a> in the ongoing Ripple vs SEC lawsuit, all motions are now fully briefed, and the judge&#8217;s decision is awaited.</li>
</ul>
<figure id="attachment_136570" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-136570" style="width: 1167px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-136570" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/24160553/XRP-price2.png" alt="" width="1167" height="630" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-136570" class="wp-caption-text">Source &#8211; Coinmarketcap</figcaption></figure>
<p>XRP is an excellent investment option for those who buy digital currencies based on a top-down investment approach to diversify their portfolio. And as it is currently, trading below $0.5, one can have an affordable entry and investment opportunity with higher returns.</p>

<h2>Dogecoin &#8211; Not A &#8220;Joke&#8221; Anymore</h2>
<p>One tweet is all it takes for <a href="https://coingape.com/price/dogecoin-4/">Dogecoin</a> to fallin’ in green. The pioneer of meme currency has been around since 2013 but became popular in early 2021 when it was chosen by Musk, the crypto advocate.</p>
<p><strong>Dogecoin bullish updates:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A “cashtag” for Dogecoin has been introduced on Twitter, positively affecting the token’s current market value.</li>
<li>Network updates and plans to include DOGE on Robinhood supported a bullish end to the week</li>
</ul>
<figure id="attachment_136565" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-136565" style="width: 1177px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-136565" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/24154415/Dogecoin.png" alt="" width="1177" height="633" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-136565" class="wp-caption-text">Source &#8211; CoinMarketCap</figcaption></figure>
<p>Looking at <a href="https://coingape.com/price/dogecoin-4/">Dogecoin&#8217;s price</a> surge recently, it is expected that this meme cryptocurrency will draw the attention of many new investors, which is good for its long-term price appreciation.</p>

At least it is the larger market sentiment that a Fed pivot to slower interest rate hike could prove to be positive for Bitcoin (BTC) price. However, if the central bank decides to continue with a 50 bps interest rate rise, it could be a path downhill for the cryptocurrencies. On the other side, a weakening US Dollar bodes well for a bullish picture for BTC price, considering the inverse relation both assets follow.</p>

<p>The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which indicates the strength of the Dollar value against various currencies, is on a downward curve in the last one month. Compared to the index value around Christmas, DXY lost more than 2%. Meanwhile, the BTC price is currently hovering around the $23,000 mark. As of writing, the top cryptocurrency is trading at $22,901, up around 0.1% in the last 24 hours, according to <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/">CoinGape price tracker</a>.</p>
<h2>Will Fed Make A Pivot In February?</h2>
<p>The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting is scheduled between January 31 and February 1. The traders would be hoping for a 0.25% rate rise in February and a similar outcome from further meetings. If this goes on to be true, BTC price could see significant rise with the news, setting a base for a potential rally thereafter. Overall, the Bitcoin price could well be dependent on the looming danger of a U.S. recession against the Fed&#8217;s monetary policy outlook.</p>

Despite the recent broad recovery in the crypto market, Dogecoin prices haven’t moved much. However, whale wallets’ transactions suggest some unfavorable moves for the DOGE.</p>
<h2>Over 300 million Dogecoin on the move</h2>
<p>As per Ðogecoin Whale Alert, crypto whales have been caught moving more than 300 million Dogecoin (approx worth $27 million) in multiple transactions over the past 24 hours. The<a href="https://twitter.com/DogeWhaleAlert/status/1617619423120003080" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> single largest transaction</a> recorded by the tracker has been of moving 123.8 million DOGE (approx worth $10.9 million) to an unknown wallet.</p>
<p>Data depicts several transactions between unknown addresses and wallet addresses labeled as Top 20 wallets. However, these wallets were caught dumping $1.03 million worth of 11.69 million DOGE in a single transaction.</p>
<p>As we dig in, WhaleAlert flashed a whale transaction moving its Dogecoin holding to <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase, crypto exchange</a> in order to dump. Whale dropped 57 million DOGE (Approx worth $5.11 million) on Coinbase. This whale move outlines that either whale are looking for a price surge ahead in order to book profit or they are trying to drag the DOGE price lower to add more tokens.</p>
<p>On the market side, <a href="https://coingape.com/price/dogecoin-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dogecoin price</a> have surged by 16% over the past 30 days. While <a href="https://coingape.com/shiba-inu-developer-hints-at-finalizing-shibarium-beta-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shiba Inu (SHIB)</a> price rose by a massive 45% in the same period.</p>
<p>However, Dogecoin prices have registered a marginal drop over the past 24 hours. As per Coinglass data, traders have liquidated $1.60 million worth of 18.03 million DOGE in the last 24 hours. It is trading at an average price of $0.088, at the press time. Its 24 hour trading volume has dropped 38% to stand at $604 million.</p>
