<p>According to the announcement, the CyberConnect Protocol Native Utility and Governance Token, CYBER is now live on Binance Launchpool, and it will be available for trading on Binance starting August 15, 2023, at 12 noon UTC . Users can start staking BNB, TUSD, and FDUSD into separate pools to farm CYBER for the next 30 days.</p>



<p>CyberConnect is one of Web3&#8217;s major decentralized social networks, allowing developers to create social applications that help users own their digital identities, content, connections, and currency channels. The project was created to address this shortcoming by establishing a community-owned social network that gives users complete control over their digital identity, completely free of the control of third parties.</p>



<p>CyberConnect provides utilities/products, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>ccProfile</li>



<li>EssenceNFT (content)</li>



<li>Subscribe to NFT</li>



<li>Link3</li>



<li>Social Recovery (unreleased)</li>
</ul>



<p>Not only receiving positive signals from Binance but on May 18, the project announced that they would open token sales on the Coinlist platform. This interests the community because Coinlist is a &#8220;big man&#8221; in the token sale segment, and the projects listed above are all quality.</p>

<p>According to the project&#8217;s share, this public sale aims to recognize community members&#8217; dedication and support to CyberConnect in building a solid foundation for a decentralized autonomous organization ( DAO) effectively and successfully. Community members can participate with a maximum value of $180 million ($1.8/CYBER), compared to a Series A funding round with a maximum value of $300 million ($3/CYBER).</p>



<p>Just last week, CyberConnect took web3 by storm with CyberTrek, a two-month campaign to bring the power of ERC-4337 and account abstraction to users. CyberConnect has become the largest smart contract account provider and market leader in this emerging field in just a few days.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Curve Finance was breached, over $50 million stolen from pools.</em></li>



<li><em>CRV token affected, sharp drop and unusual surge.</em></li>



<li><em>Mainstream DeFi tokens also decline following the attack.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a significant blow to the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/curve-dao-token/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Curve Finance</a>, a popular decentralized exchange (DEX), revealed that it suffered a security breach over the weekend. The incident impacted not only several Ethereum pools but also a liquidity pool based on Arbitrum.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-22.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="960" height="624" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-22.png" alt="Curve&#039;s Unfortunate Incident Made The Mainstream DeFi Tokens All Fell Sharply" class="wp-image-207592" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-22.png 960w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-22-300x195.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-22-768x499.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-22-750x488.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" title="Curve&#039;s Unfortunate Incident Made The Mainstream DeFi Tokens All Fell Sharply 8"></a></figure></div>


<p>As a result of the breach, Curve Finance&#8217;s native token, CRV, took a major hit in the market. On Coinbase, <a href="https://coincu.com/207312-jihan-wus-resolute-endorsement-of-curve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CRV</a> was trading down 12% over the past 24 hours. However, in a curious twist, the token experienced a surprising surge of 500% on the South Korea-based digital assets exchange, Bithumb.</p>



<p>The incident also had a broader impact on mainstream DeFi tokens, with many experiencing sharp declines. The top largest decentralized exchanges&#8217; native tokens fell after <a href="https://coincu.com/207200-curve-tvl-43-off-24h-after-attacked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Curve</a> announced the platform had been &#8220;exploited&#8221; due to a programming language flaw. COMP fell by 18.5% in 24 hours, CVX dropped by 14.3%, FXS declined by 13.02%, and AAVE experienced a 13.2% decrease in value.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-24.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="619" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-24-1024x619.png" alt="Curve&#039;s Unfortunate Incident Made The Mainstream DeFi Tokens All Fell Sharply" class="wp-image-207594" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-24-1024x619.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-24-300x181.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-24-768x465.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-24-1536x929.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-24-2048x1239.png 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-24-750x454.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-24-1140x690.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Curve&#039;s Unfortunate Incident Made The Mainstream DeFi Tokens All Fell Sharply 9"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">AAVE price chart. <em>Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Despite the exploit&#8217;s impact on CRV, the token&#8217;s role as collateral on Aave, a decentralized lending service, did not appear to lead to any &#8220;bad loans&#8221; on the Aave platform, according to Gauntlet&#8217;s Chitra.</p>



<p>Curve Finance is well-known for allowing users to exchange like-assets, such as Ethereum for Staked Ethereum or Tether&#8217;s USDT for Circle&#8217;s USDC, providing a valuable arbitrage tool for traders seeking to capitalize on price disparities between assets.</p>



<p>According to initial reports, hackers exploited the platform on Sunday, making away with over $24 million in cryptocurrency. However, blockchain security firm PeckShield later updated the stolen amount to a staggering $52 million as the attack continued to unfold in real-time.</p>



<p>The vulnerability that led to the exploit was traced back to a programming language called Vyper, which is commonly used in DeFi applications like Curve Finance. The flaw in a specific version of Vyper allowed attackers to perform a &#8220;re-entrancy&#8221; attack, affecting <a href="https://coincu.com/207193-curve-finances-liquidity-pools/">multiple stablecoin pools</a> used for pricing and liquidity across various DeFi services.</p>

<p>Curve Finance relies on smart contracts to provide various financial services, including stablecoin borrowing, trading, and lending, to its users. While decentralized finance projects offer many benefits, this incident highlights the potential risks and vulnerabilities associated with the technology.</p>



<p>As the investigation into the breach continues, the DeFi community will undoubtedly be keeping a close eye on developments and seeking ways to enhance security measures across the ecosystem.</p>

<li><em>Delphi Digital warns of Curve founder Michael Egorov&#8217;s risky position on Frax Finance, with 59 million CRV collaterals and 15.8 million FRAX debt.</em></li>



<li><em>Fraxlend&#8217;s time-weighted variable rate poses significant risks, with an interest rate expected to surge to nearly 10,000% APY in 3.5 days.</em></li>

</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a recent Twitter update, Delphi Digital, a reputable crypto investment research institution, <a href="https://twitter.com/Delphi_Digital/status/1686187973929254912" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sounded</a> the alarm over Curve Finance founder Michael Egorov&#8217;s significant exposure to <a href="https://coincu.com/199523-frax-finance-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Frax Finance</a>.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-21-1024x514.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="514" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-21-1024x514.png" alt="The Position Of Curve Founder In Frax Finance Is Carrying Great Risks" class="wp-image-207588" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-21-1024x514.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-21-300x151.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-21-768x385.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-21-360x180.png 360w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-21-750x376.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-21-1140x572.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-21.png 1164w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="The Position Of Curve Founder In Frax Finance Is Carrying Great Risks 11"></a></figure></div>


<p>The report revealed that Egorov currently holds a staggering 59 million CRV collaterals and 15.8 million FRAX debt positions on the platform, overshadowing his holdings on Aave. While the position might seem smaller in size, the intricate dynamics of Fraxlend&#8217;s time-weighted variable rate pose substantial risks to the CRV ecosystem.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-18.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="419" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-18-1024x419.png" alt="The Position Of Curve Founder In Frax Finance Is Carrying Great Risks" class="wp-image-207585" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-18-1024x419.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-18-300x123.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-18-768x314.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-18-750x307.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-18.png 1057w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="The Position Of Curve Founder In Frax Finance Is Carrying Great Risks 12"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Source: Delphi Digital</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Delphi Digital&#8217;s analysis highlighted that at the current utilization rate of 100%, the interest rate on Fraxlend doubles every 12 hours, reaching a concerning 81.2% at press time, merely an hour ago. Alarmingly, this rate is projected to surge to an eye-watering 10,000% annual percentage yield (APY) within a short span of 3.5 days. Regardless of the fluctuations in the CRV price, such an astronomically high interest rate could eventually lead to the liquidation of Egorov&#8217;s position.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-19.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="459" height="462" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-19.png" alt="The Position Of Curve Founder In Frax Finance Is Carrying Great Risks" class="wp-image-207586" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-19.png 459w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-19-298x300.png 298w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-19-150x150.png 150w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-19-75x75.png 75w" sizes="(max-width: 459px) 100vw, 459px" title="The Position Of Curve Founder In Frax Finance Is Carrying Great Risks 13"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Source: Delphi Digital</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In the worst-case scenario, with a maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of 75%, the position&#8217;s liquidation price could plunge to 0.517 CRV/FRAX within 4.5 days, equivalent to less than a 10% drop from the current price. While Egorov has attempted to mitigate risks by reducing debt and utilization rate, repaying 4 million FRAX over the last 24 hours, his efforts have been in vain as the market&#8217;s utilization rate stubbornly remains at 100%. This is primarily due to the immediate withdrawal of liquidity by users upon repayment.</p>



<p>With a position of such magnitude hanging in the balance, Delphi Digital expressed serious concerns about the impact on <a href="https://coincu.com/207312-jihan-wus-resolute-endorsement-of-curve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CRV</a> prices, considering the limited liquidity in the ecosystem. An 8-figure liquidation of Egorov&#8217;s holdings could trigger a drastic depreciation of CRV value, potentially causing ripple effects throughout the DeFi ecosystem.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-20-1024x436.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="436" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-20-1024x436.png" alt="The Position Of Curve Founder In Frax Finance Is Carrying Great Risks" class="wp-image-207587" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-20-1024x436.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-20-300x128.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-20-768x327.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-20-1536x655.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-20-750x320.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-20-1140x486.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-20.png 1727w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="The Position Of Curve Founder In Frax Finance Is Carrying Great Risks 14"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Source: Delphi Digital</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>To address the escalating risks, Michael Egorov deployed a new Curve pool and gauge on the same day, aiming to incentivize liquidity towards the lending market. The pool, consisting of crvUSD and Fraxlend&#8217;s CRV/FRAX LP token, received a seeding of 100,000 CRV rewards. This pool, directly linked to his borrowing on Fraxlend, poses the most substantial risk to his potential liquidation. Within four hours of its launch, the pool attracted $2 million in liquidity, resulting in a reduction of the utilization rate to 89%.</p>



<p>Despite these efforts, the crypto community remains vigilant about the potential ramifications of such a high-stakes situation. The health of <a href="https://coincu.com/207221-hacker-returns-5-4m-to-curve-finance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Curve Finance</a> hangs in the balance as the market anxiously awaits further developments in this unfolding financial saga.</p>



<p>Curve Finance <a href="https://coincu.com/207193-curve-finances-liquidity-pools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> yesterday that, in addition to many Ethereum pools, an Arbitrum-based liquidity pool may have been &#8220;possibly compromised&#8221; over the weekend.</p>



<p>According to preliminary assessments, the site was used for more over $24 million on Sunday. But, as the theft occurs in real-time, blockchain security company PeckShield has increased the stolen amount to $52 million.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-14.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="929" height="523" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-14.png" alt="Bankrupt FTX Confirms The Plan To Relaunch The Crypto Exchange, FTT Surges Over 12%" class="wp-image-207578" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-14.png 929w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-14-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-14-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-14-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 929px) 100vw, 929px" title="Bankrupt FTX Confirms The Plan To Relaunch The Crypto Exchange, FTT Surges Over 12% 15"></a></figure></div>


<p>The plan includes settling customer claims in cash and proposing the elimination of its digital token, FTT.</p>



<p>According to court papers filed by FTX, the proposed plan involves organizing creditors into distinct classes of claimants. One noteworthy aspect of the plan is the provision of a pathway for a specific class of claimants to potentially revive the exchange through collaboration with third-party investors, pending approval from the group.</p>



<p>To determine creditor repayments, the plan establishes three &#8220;recovery pools&#8221;: assets linked to FTX.com customers, assets linked to FTX US customers, and assets not directly connected to the exchanges. Almost all creditor classes, as per the company&#8217;s expectations, will be deemed impaired, meaning they may not be fully compensated.</p>



<p>Notably, the plan proposes no recovery for FTT tokens due to their &#8220;equity-like characteristics.&#8221; Advisers for the exchange cited that equity is typically wiped out in US bankruptcy reorganizations. The FTT token had been previously classified as a security by the SEC in a complaint filed against FTX co-founder Gary Wang and former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/206696-ftx-and-genesis-seek-court-approval-settlement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX</a> emphasized that the plan is still in its early stages and remains subject to change. In a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ftx-debtors-file-initial-plan-of-reorganization-and-term-sheet-301889872.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a>, FTX Chief Restructuring Officer John J. Ray III expressed the company&#8217;s commitment to delivering the plan promptly. The company plans to collaborate with creditors over the next few months and intends to submit an amended plan in the fourth quarter of this year.</p>



<p>The possibility of an FTX reboot had been hinted at earlier, with billings from interim CEO John Ray III mentioning &#8220;FTX restart&#8221; or a &#8220;2.0 reboot&#8221; in May filings.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s important to note that the proposed creditor-repayment plan is still under review and may undergo further changes as it progresses through the bankruptcy process.</p>



<p>Following this news, FTT spiked more than 12% on the day with excitement in the face of the quieting market.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Binance Japan to launch crypto trading services in August with 34 supported cryptocurrencies.</em></li>



<li><em>No leveraged trading due to strict Japanese regulations.</em></li>



<li><em>Consideration for adding more currencies and introducing &#8220;Simple Earn&#8221; and &#8220;NFT Marketplace&#8221; features.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Binance Japan, the Japanese subsidiary of Binance, has officially disclosed the details of its upcoming encrypted asset trading services scheduled to go live this August. The company has also revealed its initial list of supported cryptocurrencies, signaling its determination to make a mark in the competitive Japanese market, according to <em><a href="https://coinpost.jp/?p=475193" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinPost</a></em>.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-10-1024x683.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-10-1024x683.png" alt="Binance Japan Set To Redefine Crypto Trading Landscape With Exciting August Launch" class="wp-image-207570" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-10-1024x683.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-10-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-10-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-10-750x500.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-10-1140x760.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-10.png 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Binance Japan Set To Redefine Crypto Trading Landscape With Exciting August Launch 18"></a></figure></div>


<p><a href="https://coincu.com/184594-binance-japan-exchange-to-launch-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance Japan</a>&#8216;s services will include cryptocurrency spot trading and cryptoasset conversion, offering users seamless transactions between each other and the convenience of a real-time vending machine-style selling price. However, it&#8217;s noteworthy that the company has <a href="https://coincu.com/190379-binance-japan-update-global-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decided</a> against providing leveraged trading services in Japan, primarily due to the rigorous regulatory requirements associated with obtaining a &#8220;first-class financial instrument business&#8221; license in the country.</p>



<p>The exchange will boast an impressive selection of 34 cryptocurrencies available for trading on its platform, surpassing the offerings of its main domestic rivals Bitbank (30), GMO Coin (26), and Coincheck (22). Among the supported assets are popular tokens like BTC, ETC, DOT, QTUM, ALGO, ETH, ADA, ENJ, and many others. Interestingly, Binance Japan&#8217;s exclusive listing of Binance&#8217;s own exchange token, &#8220;Build and Build (BNB),&#8221; marks the first time it will be available for trading in <a href="https://coincu.com/205296-bank-of-japan-60-firms-in-digital-yen-pilot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Japan</a>.</p>



<p>In a bid to attract experienced users, Binance Japan is also exploring the addition of other currencies that are not currently listed in the Japanese market. While the specific currencies remain undisclosed, the company assures the public that they are actively working on it and are in the preparation stage.</p>

<p>Beyond traditional crypto trading services, Binance Japan plans to roll out &#8220;Simple Earn,&#8221; allowing users to deposit their cryptoassets and earn interest in the form of cryptoassets. Additionally, they will introduce an &#8220;NFT Marketplace&#8221; where users can engage in the ever-growing world of non-fungible tokens.</p>



<p>Speaking at the WebX conference hosted by <em>CoinPost</em>, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) expressed his excitement about the forthcoming launch in Japan, promising a full range of services starting in August. The company&#8217;s expansion in the region began in November 2022 when it acquired Sakura Exchange Bitcoin (SEBC) and has since been actively transitioning to the new management system.</p>

<p>CZ previously <a href="https://coincu.com/205711-binance-unveils-japan-new-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disclosed</a> that the cryptocurrency exchange giant is preparing to provide its entire services on a new platform customized exclusively for Japan.

<p>Binance Japan&#8217;s proactive approach, diverse crypto offerings, and innovative services are poised to make a significant impact on the Japanese crypto landscape. With their August launch just around the corner, cryptocurrency enthusiasts and traders are eagerly awaiting the grand unveiling of Binance Japan&#8217;s trading platform.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>As discovered by the Nansen analyst, the $BALD deployer&#8217;s ETH address used interacted with Andrew Keys and Alameda Research.</strong></h5>

<p>Nansen analyst Andrew T tweeted that after browsing Bald deployer&#8217;s ETH address, he found that Binance deposit addresses starting with 0x6663 and active addresses starting with 0x000f are related to Andrew Keys and Alameda Research.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Andrew T said the address is affiliated with many exchanges, but it must have a strong relationship with Alameda Research. These addresses have interacted with every major exchange. They made 400 transactions with USDT blacklisted addresses and are now trying to figure out which ones. After searching, it was discovered that the BALD memecoin implementer used Wintermute OTC in the past.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Has used Wintermute otc in the past <a href="https://t.co/n7CZ3Nuq6P" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/n7CZ3Nuq6P</a></p>&mdash; Andrew T (@Blockanalia) <a href="https://twitter.com/Blockanalia/status/1686136177949016064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 31, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Currently, the community is buzzing about BALD news after the suspicious action of the person behind this token on July 31 when withdrawing 10,705 ETH ($20 million) and 224.6 million tokens from the BALD/WETH liquidity pool on the DEX. Base&#8217;s LeetSwap, reduces the value of tokens by 85% in seconds.</p>



<p>Denying the above information, BALD&#8217;s account on Twitter corrected that he did not do that and added 400 ETH ($746,000) and 18M tokens to the pool, but the volume was not too large compared to the withdrawn transaction.</p>



<p>Contrary to what was said, the BALD/WETH pool once withdrew all of its liquidity. As a result, the value of this memecoin dropped by 98% within 3 hours and returned to the pre-pump price zone. Currently, there is only $61,000 of liquidity left for the token with a market cap of $4.8 million.</p>

<p>The crypto community is still monitoring the wallet of the BALD contract deployer, which is holding more than 12,400 ETH withdrawn from the pool, worth more than $23 million.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>IRS taxes cryptocurrency staking rewards as income upon gaining control of tokens.</em></li>



<li><em>The guidance applies to individual investors and staking services by exchanges.</em></li>



<li><em>US agencies scrutinize staking platforms as possible securities, IRS urged for clear crypto tax guidelines.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rr-23-14.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued</a> a ruling stating that cryptocurrency investors who receive rewards for participating in validation activities on proof-of-stake (PoS) networks should count those rewards as income in the year they gain control of the tokens.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-4.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-4-1024x683.png" alt="IRS Issues Cryptocurrency Tax Ruling: Staking Rewards Now Taxable Income" class="wp-image-207557" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-4-1024x683.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-4-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-4-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-4-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-4-750x500.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-4-1140x760.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-4.png 1599w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="IRS Issues Cryptocurrency Tax Ruling: Staking Rewards Now Taxable Income 23"></a></figure></div>


<p>According to <em><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/07/31/irs-says-staking-rewards-are-subject-to-taxes-in-year-the-investor-gets-control/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinDesk</a></em>, this latest tax guidance clarifies the taxation of cryptocurrency staking rewards and applies not only to individual investors but also to those staking tokens through cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>



<p>The IRS emphasizes that the fair market value of the validation rewards must be included in the taxpayer&#8217;s gross income in the taxable year when they gain dominion and control over the rewards. The valuation should be based on the moment the U.S. taxpayer acquires control of the tokens. This means that the taxable event occurs when the investor can freely use, transfer, or sell the rewarded tokens.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the <a href="https://coincu.com/203824-irs-probes-puerto-ricos-tax-incentive-program/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IRS</a> asserts that the rule applies equally to investors who stake tokens through cryptocurrency exchanges if they receive additional units of cryptocurrency as rewards for their participation in validation. This clarifies the tax treatment for investors using staking services provided by exchanges.</p>



<p>The IRS&#8217;s legal guidance comes amid increased scrutiny from federal and state regulators on staking services offered by crypto exchanges. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been particularly active in targeting staking platforms, considering them as potentially offering securities.</p>

<p>Notable cases include Kraken, which settled accusations from the SEC by shutting down its staking platform earlier this year, and the recent assertion by the agency that Binance&#8217;s staking service violates securities law.</p>



<p>In response to the rapidly growing crypto industry, U.S. House legislators have <a href="https://coincu.com/202061-us-senate-seeks-input-on-taxation-challenge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">urged</a> the IRS to expedite the release of comprehensive crypto tax guidelines to facilitate full compliance for businesses. An IRS official stated in April that the agency planned to develop a new operational strategy for handling cryptocurrencies within the next 12 months.</p>

<p>Outside the U.S., the IRS has <a href="https://coincu.com/186897-irs-supports-ukraine-in-crypto-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collaborated</a> with crypto investigations firm Chainalysis and Ukraine to pursue Russian billionaires who might be utilizing cryptocurrency to evade additional sanctions.</p>



<p>The IRS&#8217;s recent ruling aims to bring clarity to the taxation of cryptocurrency staking rewards, ensuring that investors are aware of their tax obligations when participating in proof-of-stake networks and staking services offered by exchanges. Cryptocurrency investors and stakeholders are advised to consult with tax professionals to ensure proper compliance with these tax regulations.</p>

<p>A few minutes ago, the leading DEX platform on Base issued a notice stating that our factory has a security pause function because their DEX was forked from Solidly. The platform found that some of the pool&#8217;s liquidity may have been compromised.</p>



<p>Currently, the team has paused all transactions to conduct an investigation. Users will not be able to trade on this exchange until further notice from the project. Several user reports have also pointed to various bugs on the platform.</p>

<p>The LeetSwap exchange emerged a few days ago when the memecoin $BALD appeared on the Base ecosystem, which has increased thousands of times, attracting the attention of users in the context of the market without many positive fluctuations. There is a lot of talk in the community about the hacked DEX being the next step of the BALD token drag carpet, a memecoin that has seen a huge increase in TVL from 0 to $55 million in just 24 hours of launch.</p>



<p>A series of memecoin projects based on Base also showed signs of <a href="https://coincu.com/207432-memecoin-bald-rug-pull-price-dropped-pver-80/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rug pull</a>. Even the $BALD project suddenly dropped 99% when a large amount of liquidity was withdrawn, thereby creating suspicion of the rug pull project.</p>

<p>According to CertiK statistics, July is the period to record the highest loss from crypto attacks so far in 2023, with $303 million being stolen from many well-known DeFi protocols. Although both the number of attacks and the damage caused by crypto-attacks in the first half of 2023 has decreased compared to 2022, the problem continues to be a problem for the crypto industry.</p>
