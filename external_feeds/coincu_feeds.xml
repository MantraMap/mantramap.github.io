<p>While it recently faced rejection from above the key $30,000 level, the top cryptocurrency has now risen more than $1,000 intraday to over $28,000 per coin after First Republic Bank shares collapsed. This sudden surge in BTC&#8217;s price is indicative of a broader trend &#8211; continued crisis in the banking sector could strengthen the increasingly positive price action.</p>



<p>In fact, over the past few months, traditional banks have been grappling with serious issues of liquidity and insolvency, which has had a knock-on effect on other areas of the economy, including Bitcoin. For instance, in early March, Silicon Valley Bank and others experienced widespread bank runs, leading to a 40% increase in BTCUSD in just a few days.</p>



<p>With First Republic Bank&#8217;s shares plummeting and more than $100 million in deposits fleeing the bank, Bitcoin is again soaring. While a $1,000 move is certainly notable, the fact that Bitcoin is retesting and holding a crucial support line is even more significant.

<p>With continued crisis in the banking sector and an increasing number of people turning to Bitcoin, it is possible that the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price will continue to rise, making it an attractive investment option for many individuals and businesses alike.</p>

<p>The court&#8217;s decision was in the case of AP vs Epic Games, the creator of the popular video game Fortnite. While the court ruled in favor of Apple on most issues, it upheld a lower court&#8217;s decision from 2021 and explained that Apple&#8217;s anti-steering provision had harmed Epic Games. The anti-steering condition is an Apple policy that states that developers cannot communicate out-of-app payment methods through certain mechanisms, such as in-app links.</p>



<p>The court explained AP&#8217;s anti-steering violation through a second angle, ruling that consumers would have flocked to Epic Games directly had they learned about its much lower commission rate of 12%, compared to Apple&#8217;s 30%. The court further explained that if consumers could learn about lower app prices, which are made possible by developers&#8217; lower costs, and can substitute to the platform with those lower prices, they would do so. This would increase the revenue generated by the Epic Games Store.</p>



<p>The ruling frees iOS developers by allowing them to direct consumers to alternative payment solutions. This may clear the path for cryptocurrency and nonfungible token (NFT) projects to add more app functionality. If AP doesn&#8217;t appeal the ruling, it could set a case law precedent benefiting creators of crypto and NFT apps because they won&#8217;t be subject to Apple&#8217;s 30% &#8220;tax.&#8221;</p>

<p>The court found the anti-steering provision to be &#8220;unfair&#8221; pursuant to both the competitor-suit &#8220;tethering test&#8221; and the consumer-suit &#8220;balancing test.&#8221; The court stated that Epic Games would have earned additional revenue since August 2020 &#8211; save for Apple&#8217;s policy &#8211; by applying these tests. The court ruling may have important implications for developers and consumers alike, as it may encourage the development of alternative payment methods and the creation of competitive platforms.</p>



<p>The decentralized exchange Uniswap is one of the latest crypto projects to make its way into the App Store, despite Apple&#8217;s initial withholding of its launch in March. Nearly two months ago, the European Union set new anti-monopolistic rules requiring Apple to permit third-party app stores on its devices, allowing consumers to circumvent Apple&#8217;s 30% commissions. However, in December, Apple interfered with NFT transactions sent on Coinbase&#8217;s self-custody wallet, claiming that it was entitled to &#8220;collect 30% of the gas fee&#8221; through in-app purchases.</p>

<p>First Republic Bank recently reported a significant decrease in total deposits, which has raised concerns among investors. The bank&#8217;s deposits fell by 41% in the first quarter, a substantial decline. Although analysts expected deposits to be around $136.7 billion, the bank only reported $102.7 billion in deposits as of April 21, 2023, down only 1.7% from March 31, 2023. The decrease is linked to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank last month. Additionally, the bank saw a reduction in year-over-year revenues of 13.4%.</p>

<p>First Republic Bank&#8217;s stock has declined significantly, over 90% YTD, causing concern among investors. The bank is taking proactive measures to reduce expenses, including cutting executive compensation, consolidating office space, and reducing nonessential projects. It plans to cut its workforce by 20-25% this quarter and is considering selling off assets to restructure its balance sheet. While Bloomberg reported that the bank is looking to sell $100 billion of loans and securities to balance its books, First Republic Bank declined to comment.</p>



<p>During the call on Monday, First Republic&#8217;s CEO, Michael Roffler, reassured investors that the bank was liquid. He stated that as of April 4, First Republic had twice the available liquidity of uninsured deposits, excluding the $30 billion received from large banks.</p>



<p>Despite concerns about uninsured deposits and the overall health of the banking system causing the company&#8217;s shares to plummet over 88%, TD Ameritrade&#8217;s Investment Movement Index noted that its clients were net buyers of First Republic Bank in March.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Voyager says Binance US has sent notice to terminate its plan to acquire the bankrupt crypto lending platform.</em></li>



<li><em>The reason the deal was canceled was due to the strict regulatory environment of the United States, which had many obstacles during the acquisition process.</em></li>



<li><em>Voyager&#8217;s attorneys warned in a recent filing that the deal&#8217;s collapse could cost its more than 1 million creditors an additional $100 million.</em></li>

<p>After announcing that it <a href="https://news.coincu.com/182647-binance-us-voyager-acquisition-agreement-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has reached</a> almost all agreements with the US government, Binance US has sent a letter to cancel the acquisition of Voyager Digital.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/ Today we received a letter from <a href="https://t.co/yG7Airmib5" target="_blank">https://t.co/yG7Airmib5</a> terminating the asset purchase agreement. While this development is disappointing, our chapter 11 plan allows for direct distribution of cash and crypto to customers (a “toggle option”) via the Voyager platform.</p>&mdash; Voyager (@investvoyager) <a href="https://twitter.com/investvoyager/status/1650921887512272917?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">April 25, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Binance.US cited the current regulatory environment as a reason to withdraw from the agreement with Voyager.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Binance.US has made the difficult decision to exercise its right to terminate the asset purchase agreement with Voyager (…). While our hope throughout this process was to help Voyager&#8217;s customers access their crypto in kind, the US&#8217;s hostile and uncertain regulatory climate has introduced an unpredictable operating environment impacting the entire American business community.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Instead, Voyager Digital will return cash and crypto to customers on its own through its platform, as the court restructuring plan has been approved. Voyager expressed disappointment in the tweet.</p>



<p>The Creditors Committee is upset and disappointed with this decision and is investigating potential claims against Binance US.</p>



<p>The initial terms allowed Binance.US to cancel the agreement within 4 months unilaterally. However, in a recent legal filing, Voyager&#8217;s lawyers warned that the deal&#8217;s failure could cost its more than 1 million creditors an additional $100 million.</p>



<p>The court authorized the deal to sell Voyager to Binance US last month at a valuation of $1.3 billion. Customers get 73% of their assets back, but this rate can be reduced to 48% if FTX and Alameda Research successfully appeal. Of the 6% of creditors who voted, 97% favored the Binance US &#8211; Voyager deal.</p>

<p>Binance US proposed to rescue Voyager last December and was approved by a New York court judge in March of this year. However, the SEC and the US Department of Justice spoke out<a href="https://news.coincu.com/173797-us-block-voyager-binance-1-billion-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> against</a> it, saying that Binance US is an unregistered stock exchange and its branch shows signs of violating US law. This scandal once made CEO Changpeng Zhao consider withdrawing from the deal.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has revealed that the regulatory agency is currently engaged in ongoing discussions with Binance. </strong></h5>

<p>The discussions come in the wake of charges that the CFTC initially filed against Binance on March 27, 2023, alleging that the popular cryptocurrency exchange solicited U.S. users to trade derivatives illegally.</p>



<p>CFTC Commissioner Kristin Johnson has stated that her agency has been in conversation with Binance to give them the opportunity to explain their conduct and work together to find a way forward. While she has not made any definitive statements regarding the course of litigation, Johnson did reveal that the CFTC typically has preliminary conversations with companies before launching litigation.</p>

<p>Despite Binance&#8217;s initial response to the charges, where they pledged to cooperate with U.S. regulators, and a number of subsequent discussions between the two parties, the CFTC has not yet found a satisfactory resolution to the matter. Johnson noted that the discussions with Binance have been focused on addressing the exchange&#8217;s &#8220;potentially problematic&#8221; actions but that the parties have not yet decided whether to settle the case out of court or to proceed with litigation.</p>



<p>In light of this ongoing legal dispute, Johnson has called for more cryptocurrency regulation from U.S. Congress, specifically around spot trading. She believes that such regulations would fall under the jurisdiction of the CFTC and would help to clarify the legal status of exchanges like Binance. While there is currently no immediate path forward in the case, Johnson remains optimistic that a solution can be found through continued discussions with Binance and other stakeholders in the cryptocurrency industry.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>SBF-linked Storybook Brawl game to shut down servers on May 1 according to a Twitter statement.</em></li>



<li><em>SBF&#8217;s crypto empire collapsed in November 2022 after experiencing a bank run.</em></li>



<li><em>Reactions to the news have been largely positive, with many wishing it could continue operating.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>On April 25th, a statement on Twitter announced that the online card game, Storybook Brawl, linked to Sam Bankman-Fried, would be shutting down its servers on May 1st. </strong></h5>

<p>Despite exploring various options, the team has decided to discontinue the game. This news comes after FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange, acquired the digital game developer Good Luck Games LLC in March 2022, with SBF mentioning at the time that the purchase would explore the intersection of NFTs, crypto, blockchain, and gaming.</p>



<p>It is worth noting that the free-to-play card game gained widespread popularity after reports emerged that SBF played it during meetings and calls. The game&#8217;s popularity has skyrocketed, amassing a loyal fan base disappointed by the shutdown. Gustavo Affonso, a gamer, expressed his willingness to contribute to crowdfunding efforts to keep the game running. The game&#8217;s fanbase is passionate and dedicated to keeping it alive.</p>



<p>Interestingly, SBF&#8217;s crypto empire collapsed in November 2022 after experiencing a bank run, leading to a decline in its stablecoin reserves. Since then, executives of the firm, including SBF, have been charged with criminal offenses. As of now, SBF is currently facing several criminal charges in connection to the case.</p>



<p>The shutdown of Storybook Brawl&#8217;s servers is a significant blow to the gaming community, especially those interested in cryptocurrency. With the rising popularity of gaming with cryptocurrency, this decision could not have come at a worse time. Nonetheless, it is crucial to remember that the gaming industry is always evolving, and something new is always on the horizon.</p>

<li><em>Cryptocurrency lending platform CoinLoan suspends all user services, including withdrawals.</em></li>



<li><em>The suggestion is that the company is going through bankruptcy proceedings even though it has not officially filed for bankruptcy.</em></li>



<li><em>The platform&#8217;s surprise announcement was made due to &#8220;no other choice&#8221;.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>On April 26, crypto lending platform CoinLoan <a href="https://coinloan.io/blog/important-message-to-all-coinloaners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in a recent announcement that it had received a notice of restricted processing, asking to stop all user activities, including user withdrawals.</strong></h5>

<p>CoinLoan called the announcement &#8220;surprise&#8221; and said the changes would take effect immediately, adding that it &#8220;had no choice but to comply.&#8221;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;A Notice of restraint on disposition received yesterday, April 24, 2023, obliges CoinLoan to halt all operations for its users, including withdrawals. This action is unexpected and has an immediate effect. As a result, we have no choice but to comply with the said requirements. We are doing everything possible to resolve this situation as quickly as possible.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The notice also states that CoinLoan cannot dispose of assets without the consent of the temporary liquidator. It also hinted that bankruptcy proceedings are underway, although the company has not confirmed that it has filed for bankruptcy.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Our legal team has provided sufficient arguments to prove CoinLoan&#8217;s ability to fulfill its obligations.

We are going to file an appeal, but we must also obey the existing court ruling.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The lending platform has been waning since July following the Terra crisis and the collapse of a series of significant crypto funds. It had to <a href="https://news.coincu.com/105697-coinloan-decreases-withdrawal-limit-by-99/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">limit</a> user withdrawals in July 2022, which also applies to the FTX crisis in November 2022. In both cases, CoinLoan set a daily withdrawal limit of 5,000 dollars, and it needs to be clarified if the platform will remove this withdrawal limit.</p>

<p>The agreement marks an important step in FTX&#8217;s efforts to return funds to stakeholders following its bankruptcy filing in November 2022.</p>



<p>FTX acquired LedgerX in 2021 and rebranded the service as US Derivatives. The move was seen as a strategic one, with the acquisition allowing FTX to expand its reach in the derivatives trading market. However, FTX&#8217;s bankruptcy filing put those plans on hold.</p>



<p>Now, with the agreement to sell LedgerX to M7 Holdings, an affiliate of Miami International Holdings, Inc., FTX and its debtors expect to earn $50 million from the deal. FTX CEO John Ray III expressed optimism about the sale and its potential to benefit stakeholders.</p>



<p>The sale agreement is set to be approved in a court hearing on May 4, 2023. Assuming the agreement is approved, Miami International Holdings, Inc. (MIH) will carry out the purchase itself, according to a separate announcement from the buyer.</p>



<p>MIH is the owner of the Miami International Securities Exchange (MIAX), and has made strategic investments in the crypto industry. For example, in April 2023, MIAX invested in CoinFLEX, a crypto firm that has faced controversy in recent months. While many investors have denied investing in OPNX, the successor to failed crypto firms Three Arrows Capital and CoinFLEX, MIAX&#8217;s investment in CoinFLEX suggests that the company sees value in the crypto industry despite the risks and controversies that come with it.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The New York Fed has restricted its reverse repurchase program (RRP) partner standards, which could prevent stablecoin issuer Circle from obtaining a Fed loan.</em></li>



<li><em>Circle is said to have placed about $25 billion in short-term US Treasury reserves in a separate fund managed by BlackRock called the Circle Reserve fund.</em></li>



<li><em>The RRP allows selected partners to lend to the Fed overnight at a fixed rate (currently 4.8%).</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>On Wednesday, the New York Federal Reserve Bank <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/opolicy/operating_policy_230425" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">restricted</a> its reverse repurchase program (RRP) partner standards, which could prevent stablecoin issuer Circle from taking loans from the Fed.</strong></h5>

<p>According to a press release from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the funds are &#8220;organized for a single beneficial owner&#8221; and registered as a &#8220;2a-7 fund&#8221; with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) &#8220;will generally be considered ineligible.&#8221; Because the Circle Reserve Fund seems to fall into this category.</p>



<p>Circle is said to have placed about $25 billion in short-term US Treasury reserves in a separate fund <a href="https://news.coincu.com/139450-circle-internet-financial-usdc-blackrock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">managed </a>by BlackRock called the Circle Reserve fund. According to an earlier press release from Circle and the SEC filing with the fund, the Circle Reserve Fund is only used by Circle and is registered as a &#8220;2a-7&#8221; government money market fund.</p>



<p>RRP allows selected partners (e.g. money market funds, banks) to lend to the Fed overnight at a fixed rate (currently 4.8%). While the instrument was originally created as a stabilizing tool for the financial system, it has since become an attractive means of obtaining high returns with minimal counterparty risk. Currently, the funding for the program is nearly $2.3 trillion.</p>



<p>In January, the Banking Policy Institute, a key advocacy group for US banks, said Circle&#8217;s USDC with access to the RRP would create &#8220;a stable currency effectively backed by the Fed.&#8221; and potentially destabilize the financial system. Fox-Geen added that this access would pave the way to move USDC&#8217;s remaining cash reserves from partner banks to funds under Fed accounts.</p>

<p>When its financial partner Silicon Valley Bank abruptly failed last month, USDC faced a problem and briefly lost its peg. Until the government bailed out depositors who had more deposits above the deposit insurance limit of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, almost $3.3 billion of USDC&#8217;s cash reserve stored at SVB remains unreachable for days and sent shockwaves across the stablecoin market.</p>
