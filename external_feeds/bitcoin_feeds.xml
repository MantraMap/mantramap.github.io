<h2>Indian Government Official on Crypto</h2>
<p>Indian government official Rajeev Chandrasekhar talked about cryptocurrency Thursday at an event in Bengaluru. Chandrasekhar currently serves as both India&#8217;s Minister of State for Electronics and Information Technology and Minister of State for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship. He is also a member of Rajya Sabha, the upper house of parliament.</p>
<p>He explained that India has no issue with cryptocurrencies if all laws are followed, Reuters reported, quoting him as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is nothing today that outlaws crypto as long as you follow the legal process.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Indian government <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indian-government-updates-parliament-on-cryptocurrency-bill-and-investigations-of-crypto-exchanges/">has not yet established</a> a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency. In December last year, the government told parliament that crypto legislation &#8220;can be effective only with significant international collaboration.&#8221; Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman recently said the government plans to discuss crypto regulations with the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/india-to-discuss-crypto-during-g20-presidency-to-establish-tech-driven-regulatory-framework-says-finance-minister/">G20 countries</a>.</p>

<p>However, crypto income is already taxed at 30% in India, and a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) is levied on crypto transactions. Earlier this month, the government revealed that it is launching a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indian-government-launching-crypto-awareness-campaign/">crypto awareness campaign</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, India&#8217;s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has recommended a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indian-central-bank-rbi-favors-complete-crypto-ban-partial-ban-wont-work/">complete ban</a> on cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said last week that &#8220;Cryptocurrency does not have any underlying value,&#8221; warning that &#8220;it will <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indian-central-bank-chief-insists-crypto-should-be-banned-warns-it-will-undermine-authority-of-rbi/">undermine</a> the authority of the RBI and lead to the dollarization of the economy.&#8221; He even expects crypto to cause the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indias-central-bank-chief-cryptocurrencies-will-cause-next-financial-crisis-if-theyre-not-banned/">next financial crisis</a> if it is not banned.</p>

<h2>JPMorgan&#x2019;s CEO on Bitcoin and Its Supply Cap</h2>
<p>The CEO of global investment bank JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, reiterated his skepticism about bitcoin in an interview with CNBC Thursday. The JPMorgan executive claimed:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin itself is a hyped-up fraud. It&#x2019;s a pet rock.</p></blockquote>
<p>Regarding the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, Dimon commented: &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not surprised at all. I call them a decentralized Ponzi scheme. The hype around this thing has been extraordinary.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Dimon also reiterated his doubt about <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s 21 million supply cap, suggesting that bitcoin&#x2019;s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto could remove the cryptocurrency&#x2019;s supply limit. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>How do you know it&#x2019;s going to stop at 21 million? Maybe it&#x2019;s going to get to 21 million and Satoshi&#x2019;s picture is going to come up and laugh at you all &#x2026; and by then Satoshi would have taken out billions of dollars.</p></blockquote>
<p>While he is bullish on blockchain technology, the JPMorgan boss stressed: &#x201C;Crypto itself doesn&#x2019;t do anything. It&#x2019;s a pet rock.&#x201D; He then told the news outlet: &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t care about bitcoin so we should drop this subject.&#x201D;</p>

<p>This was not the first time Dimon <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-boss-jamie-dimon-bitcoin-worthless-btcs-limited-supply/">questioned bitcoin&#x2019;s limited supply</a>. In October 2021, he similarly said: &#x201C;How do you know it ends at 21 million? You all read the algorithms? You guys all believe that? I don&#x2019;t know, I&#x2019;ve always been a skeptic of stuff like that.&#x201D; Last December, he likened crypto tokens to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-chase-ceo-jamie-dimon-likens-crypto-to-pet-rocks-calls-for-more-regulation/">pet rocks</a>. Moreover, he said during a congressional hearing in September that cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, are &#x201C;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgans-jamie-dimon-tells-congress-crypto-tokens-like-bitcoin-are-decentralized-ponzi-schemes">decentralized Ponzi schemes</a>.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Many bitcoin proponents mocked Dimon on social media for his lack of understanding. One <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMotorist/status/1616231411555467265">tweeted</a>: &#x201C;Dimon just said on CNBC that Satoshi can increase the Bitcoin cap. He&#x2019;s an idiot but I am sure most people agree with him. Satoshi is irrelevant, it&#x2019;s the code and the network now.&#x201D; Another <a href="https://twitter.com/protocoholic/status/1616093749590851584">opined</a>: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s sad that Jamie Dimon doesn&#x2019;t understand that you can look at the source code to know that a laughing picture of Satoshi doesn&#x2019;t come up at 21,000,000.&#x201D; A third <a href="https://twitter.com/jameslavish/status/1616286825739345921">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Jamie Dimon either has no clue what Bitcoin is, or he knows exactly what it is, yet ridicules and dismisses it out of pure fear of it being the ultimate disruptor to legacy banking&#x2019;s core business of excessive and egregious fees.</p></blockquote>

Nobuyasu Sugimoto, deputy division chief of the financial supervision and regulation division of the IMF, and Bo Li, deputy managing director at the IMF, believe that, given the growing links between legacy finance and crypto, cryptocurrency&#8217;s volatility might bring systemic risks to the existing markets.</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">IMF Blog Post Calls for Containing Future Crypto Contagion</h2>
<p>The volatility and instability of cryptocurrency markets are starting to worry regulators from all over the world. On Jan. 18, Nobuyasu Sugimoto, deputy division chief of the financial supervision and regulation division of the IMF, and Bo Li, deputy managing director at the IMF, <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2023/01/18/crypto-contagion-underscores-why-global-regulators-must-act-fast-to-stem-risk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issued</a> an article warning about the effect that the volatility of crypto markets might have on the existing financial system.<br /><br />The article remarks that the instability developed in crypto markets as a result of the different collapses of tokens and exchanges might affect traditional markets and institutions, given the current deepening of the links between these two systems.</p>
<p>Regulating these markets is one of the elements to prevent this from happening, according to the authors, who also indicate that investors in developed markets have been flocking to some of these assets due to the returns they offer. The IMF Blog post states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Advanced economies are also susceptible to financial stability risks from crypto, given that institutional investors have increased stablecoin holdings, attracted by higher rates of return in the previously low-interest rate environment.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Risks of Substitution and Cryptoization</h2>
<p>While the IMF still does not consider crypto and stablecoins as serious risks to the global financial system, some countries are substituting their currency with crypto and stablecoins, making international control of these funds especially difficult. For Sugimoto and Li, this situation has &#8220;the potential to cause capital outflows, a loss of monetary sovereignty, and threats to financial stability, creating new challenges for policymakers.&#8221;</p>
<p>This can be seen in <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/argentina-runs-to-stablecoins-amidst-political-and-economic-uncertainty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">economies</a> that are being rammed with high levels of inflation and devaluation at the same time, with citizens losing trust in their fiat currencies and flocking to other alternatives, such as dollar-pegged stablecoins.</p>
<p>To control these risks, the blog post authors recommend setting up global regulations for virtual asset service providers, forcing customer assets to be segregated from the holdings of these companies. Also, stablecoin issuers should be heavily regulated, and are even advised to exert bank-like regulations, depending on the size of the project. Experts have stated before that a run on stablecoins might <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cornell-professor-warns-of-disruption-to-us-bond-market-from-potential-collapse-of-major-stablecoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">affect</a> the U.S. Treasuries market.</p>
<p>Also, the global implementation of the Basel Committee <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/basel-committee-finalizes-rules-for-bank-exposure-to-cryptocurrency-assets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">directives</a>, a standard on how much cryptocurrency exposure banks can have at any point in time, must be accelerated.</p>

This equates to a more than 18% redemption of the circulating supply of WBTC since Nov. 27, 2022.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>WBTC Remains Largest Operation in Terms of Bitcoin Custody Despite Recent Redemptions</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
The Bitgo-backed <a href="https://wbtc.network">Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)</a> project has been officially in operation since the end of January 2019 and has grown significantly since its launch. At the time of writing, it is the largest operation in terms of the number of bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) custodied to back the WBTC token value.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
On January 20, 2023, WBTC is the 19th largest crypto asset by market capitalization, valued at $21,278 per unit. WBTC&#x2019;s market valuation on Friday afternoon Eastern Time was around $3.8 billion. According to the project&#x2019;s website and <a href="https://wbtc.network/dashboard/order-book">transparency dashboard</a>, at 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Jan. 20, 2023, there were approximately 180,197 WBTC in circulation on the Ethereum chain.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The project also manages 99.89 WBTC which is hosted on the Tron blockchain network. The stash of ERC20-based WBTC tokens is substantially less than it was 54 days ago on Nov. 27, 2022, when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221127040329/https://etherscan.io/token/0x2260fac5e5542a773aa44fbcfedf7c193bc2c599">220,353 WBTC</a> ($16.4K per <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) was circulating on the Ethereum blockchain network. Ten months prior, on Feb. 26, 2022, the number of WBTC in circulation was approximately <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220226042330/https://etherscan.io/token/0x2260fac5e5542a773aa44fbcfedf7c193bc2c599">262,662</a> ($39.4K per <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>).&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
That means over the last ten months, 31.39% of the WBTC in circulation was removed from the overall supply. More than half of that percentage, or 18.22%, of the WBTC supply was redeemed over the last 54 days, or 40,156 WBTC total, since Nov. 27, 2022.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
While WBTC is the largest wrapped version of bitcoin, Lido&#x2019;s staking token STETH, a derivative of Ethereum, is the largest synthetic version of a top crypto asset in terms of market capitalization. STETH, however, does operate differently than Bitgo&#x2019;s management of simply holding the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> for the given amount issued.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
While there&#x2019;s 180,197 WBTC in circulation today, there&#x2019;s approximately 180,205 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> backing the WBTC supply in Bitgo&#x2019;s custody, according to the website&#x2019;s dashboard. The supplies of wrapped or synthetic <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> tokens have followed the same trend as stablecoins, as the stablecoin economy has seen billions in redemptions over the last year.&#13;<br />

<h2>Brett Harrison&#8217;s Architect Aims to Connect Institutional Investors Across Decentralized and Centralized Exchanges</h2>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/BrettHarrison88">Brett Harrison</a>, the former president of FTX who left the company in Sept. 2022, has started a <a href="https://www.architect.xyz/">new venture</a> aimed at attracting institutions to the world of decentralized finance (defi). &#8220;It&#8217;s a software company aimed at building institutional-grade infrastructure to connect various crypto venues across decentralized and centralized exchanges,&#8221; Harrison <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/20/coinbase-and-others-back-ex-ftx-us-presidents-crypto-trading-infra-startup-architect/">told</a> Techcrunch reporter Jacquelyn Melinek on Friday.</p>
<p>Harrison&#8217;s new venture and fresh capital raise follow the former president of FTX US <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/former-president-of-ftx-us-shares-his-experience-and-relationship-with-ceo-sam-bankman-fried-in-detailed-twitter-thread/">recounting</a> how he left the company and his relationship with its co-founder, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF). Harrison detailed that his relationship with SBF and the FTX CEO&#8217;s deputies &#8220;had reached a point of total deterioration.&#8221; In the 49-part Twitter thread, Harrison mentioned a new crypto startup he was working on. Harrison <a href="https://twitter.com/BrettHarrison88/status/1616438221872701441?s=20&amp;t=uZcLSGdhfDsVM7EeCWvRKg">tweeted</a> about the capital raise on Friday and said, &#8220;I&#8217;m very happy to announce the founding of [Architect] and the closing of our [$5 million] seed round.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harrison <a href="https://twitter.com/BrettHarrison88/status/1616438223055556609?s=20&amp;t=uZcLSGdhfDsVM7EeCWvRKg">added</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Architect will build institutional-grade trading technology that streamlines crypto market structure, making it easier and safer for firms and large traders to access decentralized protocols and centralized exchanges alike. Architect’s products will embody our commitment to security, self-custody, extensibility, and open source design.</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition to Circle Ventures and Coinbase Ventures, Architect received a capital injection from Motivate Venture Capital, SALT Fund, SV Angel, P2P Validator, Third King Venture Capital, Shari Glazer, and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/skybridge-capitals-scaramucci-on-crypto-boom-institutions-are-not-there/">Anthony Scaramucci</a>, the founder of Skybridge Capital. Harrison&#8217;s Architect fundraising also follows a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/new-ftx-ceo-discusses-possibility-of-rebooting-defunct-crypto-exchange-in-first-interview-since-taking-over/">recent interview</a> with FTX&#8217;s new CEO, John J. Ray III, who told The Wall Street Journal that FTX was exploring the possibility of restarting the now-defunct crypto exchange.</p>

The document details that investigators discovered fiat currencies, crypto assets, and securities as part of FTX&#x2019;s and Alameda Research&#x2019;s cache. However, the disclosure to unsecured creditors does not mention the extremely large stash of non-fungible tokens the company had accrued over the years.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>FTX and Alameda&#x2019;s Liquidated Assets Include Thousands of NFTs and ENS Names</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
FTX&#x2019;s inner circle and the quantitative trading company Alameda Research were heavily involved in the non-fungible token (NFT) hype that began in 2021. In fact, after FTX and Alameda filed for bankruptcy protection, our news desk parsed through a large number of Alameda/FTX-associated wallets and discovered thousands of NFTs and Ethereum Name Service (ENS) names.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The discoveries were derived from wallets <a href="https://twitter.com/lawmaster/status/1589510081694949377?s=20&t=_my477b3QgK5FvsTdDXgRw">labeled</a> by Block researcher <a href="https://twitter.com/lawmaster">Larry Cermak</a> and parsed data from the crypto monitoring application <a href="https://www.arkhamintelligence.com">Arkham Intelligence</a> and <a href="https://dappradar.com/">dappradar.com</a>&#x2018;s portfolio viewer. For example, the Alameda-linked address &#x201C;<a href="https://dappradar.com/hub/wallet/eth/0x1165656a95de9067c4348b365beb31409c9a278d">0x116</a>&#x201D; holds around $100,000 in crypto tokens, but it also holds 107 ENS names. It&#x2019;s possible that Alameda thought it could flip ENS names in the future, as the firm obtained a great number of common names.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Alameda and now the liquidators own ENS names such as &#x201C;tickets.eth,&#x201D; &#x201C;payment.eth,&#x201D; &#x201C;network.eth,&#x201D; &#x201C;dungeon.eth,&#x201D; &#x201C;packager.eth,&#x201D; &#x201C;nootropic.eth,&#x201D; &#x201C;breakfast.eth,&#x201D; and many more. Most are not worth very much, but some of the specific ENS names like &#x201C;payment.eth&#x201D; and &#x201C;network.eth,&#x201D; have sold for close to $9,000 per name. Alameda&#x2019;s ENS name collection is not mentioned in the 20-page presentation shown to FTX&#x2019;s unsecured creditors.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Last year in January, there were a lot of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/2-mirrored-copycat-bored-ape-nft-projects-cause-copyright-infringement-controversy/">controversies</a> when a few mirrored non-fungible token (NFT) collections appeared on the scene, copying the artwork of Cryptopunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFTs. Interestingly, Alameda&#x2019;s <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> address &#x201C;<a href="https://dappradar.com/hub/wallet/eth/0x0f4ee9631f4be0a63756515141281a3e2b293bbe">0x0f4</a>&#x201D; holds a massive quantity of unofficial &#x201C;flipped&#x201D; Cryptopunks and &#x201C;mirrored&#x201D; BAYC NFTs.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The &#x201C;0x0f4&#x201D; address holds 2,447 NFTs in the wallet from 629 different NFT collections. Alameda&#x2019;s &#x201C;0x0f4&#x201D; collected NFTs from compilations such as Time Frog, Party-Animals, Metawarden, Shrouded Playground, and many more from dozens of relatively unknown NFT collections.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Alameda collected blue-chip non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as well, and <a href="https://dune.com/21shares_research/alameda-and-ftx-tracker">records</a> show the firm obtained 11 legitimate Cryptopunks, which are collectively worth an estimated $784,000. The trading platform purchased seven different Art Blocks Curated, which have an estimated value of around $1.47 million on Jan. 20, 2023.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Alameda and now the liquidators own 81 land NFTs from The Sandbox, which are collectively worth an estimated $155,000. Alameda obtained two Otherdeeds as well, which are now worth around $25,000, and 12 different Meebits, which are valued at an estimated $88,000 today. A great deal of blue-chip NFTs can be found in the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> address &#x201C;<a href="https://dappradar.com/hub/wallet/eth/0xca436e14855323927d6e6264470ded36455fc8bd">0xca4</a>.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
That specific wallet holds some of Alameda&#x2019;s most valuable NFTs, including the Otherdeed land titles and two Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) NFTs worth roughly $50,000 in combined value. Larry Cermak&#x2019;s Alameda address list highlights approximately 29 different Ethereum addresses. Furthermore, Arkham Intelligence data indicates that there are 68 addresses tied to the quantitative trading platform <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-shows-financial-troubles-plagued-bankman-frieds-alameda-research-as-early-as-2018/">Alameda Research</a>.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Out of the large swath of Alameda addresses, a decent handful of the wallets own NFTs. Most of these wallets are assumed to be controlled by the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/new-ftx-ceo-discusses-possibility-of-rebooting-defunct-crypto-exchange-in-first-interview-since-taking-over/">FTX bankruptcy team</a> and liquidators. Just in tokens alone, Alameda&#x2019;s 68 tethered Ethereum-based wallets indicate a net value of around $189.12 million.&#13;<br />

On Jan. 18, Wang Feng, founder of China-based news publication Marsbit, announced his intentions to purchase Coindesk along with other members of the crypto industry. This news follows a report from Semafor at the end of November 2022 stating that Coindesk had received takeover solicitations from several investors.</strong></p>
<h2>Coindesk&#8217;s Alleged Asking Price: $200 Million or More as Charles Hoskinson and Marsbit Express Interest in Purchase</h2>
<p>Investors are reportedly considering purchasing the cryptocurrency news publication Coindesk after a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group (DCG), Genesis Global Capital, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-lender-genesis-files-for-bankruptcy-following-sec-lawsuit/">filed</a> for bankruptcy protection. Coindesk is an independently operated news and conference business that is wholly owned by DCG.</p>
<p>According to Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of Ethereum and founder of Cardano, sources familiar with the matter have indicated that the asking price for the news outlet Coindesk is around $200 million. Hoskinson has expressed interest in purchasing Coindesk, as stated in a <a href="https://youtu.be/DVQuGQIAxoI">Youtube video</a> titled &#8220;Buying Coindesk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hoskinson’s $200 million quote is less than the estimate given to Semafor at the end of Nov. 2022 when sources <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/11/29/2022/online-news-site-coindesk-attracts-suitors-amid-crypto-crash">informed</a> the news publication that investors were interested in buying Coindesk. At that time, Semafor&#8217;s Bradley Saacks and Liz Hoffman reported that there was a &#8220;suggested $300 million purchase price.&#8221; The report added that people familiar with the matter stated that the $300 million estimate was &#8220;considered too low.&#8221;</p>
<p>Semafor&#8217;s Bradley Saacks said Coindesk generates most of its revenue from events such as the Consensus conferences and advertising. Saacks notes that the revenue &#8220;pool of both is shrinking fast.&#8221; In addition to Charles Hoskinson, Wang Feng, the founder of China-based news publication Marsbit, has also <a href="https://twitter.com/wangfeng_0128/status/1615908646919213056?s=20&amp;t=8veOnxTQsE0KiN3X0g4vYQ">announced</a> intentions to purchase the publication. Marsbit is a news publication backed by Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange by trade volume.</p>
<p>Wang announced on Jan. 18, 2023, that Marsbit is willing to &#8220;organize a number of well-known funds to jointly acquire and integrate Coindesk,&#8221; according to the founder’s tweet. He also stated that the Consensus conference business would be included in the acquisition. Coindesk was originally founded in 2013 by entrepreneur <a href="https://twitter.com/shak">Shakil Khan</a>, who is also the co-founder of Prima Materia and an early investor in Bitpay.</p>
<p>Coindesk was acquired by DCG in Jan. 2016, for an estimated amount of $500,000 to $600,000, according to a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/13/coindesk-acquired-by-digital-currency-group/">report</a> by Techcrunch reporter Lucas Matney. Coindesk published an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160113164733/http://www.coindesk.com/coindesk-acquired-digital-currency-group-consensus-2016/">article</a> about the acquisition, noting that they were &#8220;excited&#8221; to join DCG and mentioning that DCG had been one of Coindesk&#8217;s &#8220;earliest investors and supporters.&#8221;</p>

Friday&#x2019;s move saw the token move closer to a key resistance level of $12.50. Solana also moved higher earlier in the day, as price bounced from a key support point. </strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Cosmos (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ATOM" 312034  target="_blank">ATOM</a>)</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Cosmos (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ATOM" 312034  target="_blank">ATOM</a>), was one of Friday&#x2019;s notable gainers, as the token moved closer to a key resistance level.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Following a low of $11.70 on Thursday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ATOM" 312034  target="_blank">ATOM</a>/USD raced to an intraday peak of $12.38 earlier today.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As a result of this move, cosmos moved towards a resistance point at the $12.50 level, which was last hit on Monday.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Looking at the chart, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is also hovering near a ceiling of its own, at 66.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Currently, the index is tracking at 65.85, which could lead to marginal consolidation, with earlier bulls opting to liquidate their positions.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
However, should this aforementioned ceiling be broken, then it is likely that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ATOM" 312034  target="_blank">ATOM</a> could move towards $13.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>Solana (SOL)</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Like <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ATOM" 312034  target="_blank">ATOM</a>, solana (SOL) also edged higher, as the token continued to move away from a support point at $20.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
SOL/USD rose to a high of $21.77 earlier in the session, and followed on from a low of $20.53 the day prior.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Today&#x2019;s rally sees solana in a bullish attempt to regain market momentum, following recent declines in price.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As can be seen on the chart, the move took place despite the RSI remaining below its own ceiling at 68.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Due to this, earlier gains have somewhat eased, as traders seemed to be preparing for another reversal.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Currently solana is trading at $21.43, with longer-term bulls still likely targeting an exit at the $24.00 mark.&#13;<br />

The filing followed a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Genesis claims to have &#8220;ample liquidity to support its ongoing business operations and facilitate the restructuring process.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Genesis&#8217; Bankruptcy Filing</h2>
<p>Genesis Global Holdco LLC, a prime brokerage subsidiary of venture capital firm Digital Currency Group (DCG), announced Friday that it has voluntarily filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s two lending business subsidiaries, Genesis Global Capital LLC and Genesis Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd., are part of the bankruptcy filing while &#8220;other subsidiaries involved in the derivatives and spot trading and custody businesses and Genesis Global Trading are not included in the filing and continue client trading operations,&#8221; the announcement clarifies.</p>
<p>&#8220;As part of its Chapter 11 filing, Genesis has proposed a roadmap to an exit including a Chapter 11 plan,&#8221; the company detailed, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>The plan contemplates a dual track process in pursuit of a sale, capital raise and/or equitization transaction that would enable the business to emerge under new ownership.</p></blockquote>
<p>Derar Islim, Genesis&#8217; interim CEO, explained that prior to the bankruptcy filing, the company has been trying to &#8220;remedy liquidity issues,&#8221; including those caused by the default of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) and the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. Islim was appointed to his position last August.</p>
<p>Genesis claims to have more than $150 million in cash on hand that &#8220;will provide ample liquidity to support its ongoing business operations and facilitate the restructuring process.&#8221; The company has filed motions with the bankruptcy court &#8220;to enable day-to-day operations to continue in the normal course.&#8221; The announcement adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>Redemptions and new loan originations in the lending business remain suspended, and claims will be addressed through the Chapter 11 process.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Repaying Gemini Earn Investors</h2>
<p>With a court-supervised restructuring process, Genesis explained that it plans to advance discussions with its creditors and parent company DCG in the hope of reaching &#8220;a holistic solution for its lending business, which, if achieved, would provide an optimal outcome for Genesis clients and Gemini Earn users.&#8221;</p>
<p>Genesis and crypto exchange Gemini have been in a feud over Gemini&#8217;s crypto lending program, Earn. Genesis froze withdrawals last November while holding approximately $900 million in investor assets from more than 340,000 Gemini Earn investors.</p>
<p>Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss stated on Twitter Friday that Genesis&#8217; bankruptcy filing &#8220;is a crucial step&#8221; towards Earn customers being able to recover their assets. However, he noted, &#8220;Crucially, the decision to put Genesis into bankruptcy does not insulate Barry [Silbert], DCG, and any other wrongdoers from accountability,&#8221; elaborating:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have been preparing to take direct legal action against Barry, DCG, and others who share responsibility for the fraud that has caused harm to the 340,000+ Earn users and others duped by Genesis and its accomplices.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Unless Barry and DCG come to their senses and make a fair offer to creditors, we will be filing a lawsuit against Barry and DCG imminently. We also believe that — in addition to owing creditors all of their money back — Genesis, DCG, and Barry owe them an explanation. Bankruptcy court provides a much-needed forum for that to happen,&#8221; the Gemini co-founder concluded.</p>
<p>Last week, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-charges-genesis-and-gemini-winklevoss-says-regulators-lawsuit-is-super-lame/">charged</a> both Gemini and Genesis Global Capital &#8220;for the unregistered offer and sale of securities to retail investors through the Gemini Earn crypto asset lending program.&#8221;</p>

After falling by nearly 4% in Thursday&#x2019;s session, the global market cap is up by 1.14% as of writing. This comes despite the news that crypto lender Genesis has recently filed for bankruptcy. Ethereum was also in the green, as it rebounded from Thursday&#x2019;s lows.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) climbed higher on Friday, as the world&#x2019;s largest cryptocurrency rebounded from Thursday&#x2019;s losses.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The rally comes despite the news that crypto lender Genesis has filed for bankruptcy, following the likes of FTX.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD rose to an intraday high of $21,175.24 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, which comes following a low of $20,689.88 on Thursday.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Looking at the chart, today&#x2019;s rebound in price came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) moved back above the 80.00 mark.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As of writing, the index is at the 80.40 level, with the next visible resistance level at the 88.00 zone.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Many expect that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> could make another attempt to break out of a key resistance point at $21,400.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
In addition to bitcoin, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) also rebounded during today&#x2019;s session, with prices continuing to move away from a recent floor.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Following a low of $1,515.79 on Thursday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD raced to a peak of $1,559.55 earlier in the day.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Today&#x2019;s surge comes as ethereum continues to move away from a recent support point at the $1,500 level.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Similar to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, the move comes following a dead cat bounce on the RSI indicator, with price strength rebounding from a recent low.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Currently, the index is tracking at a level of 74.64, which is marginally higher than the aforementioned floor at 70.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> bulls will likely now be targeting a resistance level at the $1,600 level.&#13;<br />
