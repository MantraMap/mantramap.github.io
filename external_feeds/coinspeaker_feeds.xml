										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/citigroup-banamex-public/">Citigroup Unveils Plans to Take Its Mexican Offshoot Banamex Public</a></p>
<p>American multinational investment banking giant <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/citigroup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Citigroup Inc</a> (NYSE: C) has revealed its plans to pursue an Initial Public Offering (IPO) for its Mexico business, Banamex. The bank intends to separate Banamex from its operations and offer shares of Banamex to the public for the first time.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.citigroup.com/global/news/press-release/2023/citi-mexico-operations-update-24052023" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announcement</a>, Banamex, as a separate entity from Citigroup, will retain various business lines and services. These include credit cards, retail banking, consumer loans, residential mortgage lending, insurance, deposits, and a full suite of commercial banking products.</p>
<p>Additionally, the business will be reported as part of Citi&#8217;s ongoing operations until ownership falls below a 50% voting stake, at which point it will no longer be consolidated. Meanwhile, the bank first <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/01/11/citi-will-exit-its-mexico-business.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a> its intention to depart the Mexico Consumer business, which operates about 1,300 branches with more than 12 million retail clients, and about 10 million pension fund customers in 2022.</p>
<p>Citigroup said it expects the separation to be completed in the second half of 2024, with a public offering expected in 2025. Although the bank has not yet decided on a listing destination, a source familiar with the plan revealed that a dual listing in the US and Mexico could be possible.</p>
<p>By conducting an IPO for Banamex, Citigroup aims to establish Banamex as an independent entity. This will allow Banamex to operate autonomously with its own shareholders and potentially its own management team, focusing on the Mexican market.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Citigroup has invested a substantial amount worth $2.5 billion specifically to enhance Banamex&#8217;s digital and mobile banking capabilities. This investment indicates Citigroup&#8217;s commitment to leveraging technology to improve the banking experience and meet the evolving needs of its customers in an increasingly digital era.</p>
<h2>The Citigroup and Banamex IPO: The Goal</h2>
<p>The IPO process would involve offering shares of Banamex to the public, allowing outside investors to purchase those shares and become partial owners of Banamex. The proceeds from the IPO would provide Banamex with additional capital to support its growth, expansion, and operational needs.</p>
<p>The Chief Financial Officer of Citigroup Mark Mason stated that the bank’s decision would allow Citigroup to focus on its core operations while potentially unlocking value for shareholders through the IPO. Additionally, Mason highlighted that the spinoff would enable Citigroup to resume a modest level of share buybacks in the current quarter.</p>
<p>Notably, share buybacks are a process through which a corporation repurchases its own shares from the market, which can benefit shareholders by increasing the value of the remaining shares. Many companies including <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/apple-inc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Inc</a> (NASDAQ: AAPL) are known to have a <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/apple-90b-buyback-dividends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">robust share buyback program</a>.</p>
<p>However, Mason’s statement also acknowledges the uncertainty surrounding regulatory capital requirements, noting that the firm “&#8230;will continue to evaluate share buybacks quarterly, taking into account regulatory issues as well as any modifications or updates that may arise.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/japan-stricter-anti-money-laundering-crypto/">Japan Implements Stricter Anti-Money Laundering Measures for Cryptocurrency Transactions</a></p>
<p>On May 23, Japan announced that it will implement stricter measures against money laundering (AML) in cryptocurrency transactions starting from June 1, in order to comply with global regulations.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2023/05/c6410ba692f5-japan-to-enforce-crypto-anti-money-laundering-steps-from-june.html?phrase=crypto&amp;words=crypto" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Kyodo News</a>, the decision to strengthen the regulations was made after a review of relevant laws in December, when it was determined that the existing measures were insufficient, according to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international financial supervisory organization.</p>
<h2>Japan to Implement Stricter Rules for Exchanges</h2>
<p>One of the most notable features of the new regulatory framework is the implementation of the so-called &#8220;travel rule&#8221; issued by the FATF, which requires financial institutions to provide detailed information about their customers&#8217; transactions, including all their registration data such as names and addresses. Those who do not comply with the regulations will face criminal sanctions.</p>
<p>With this measure, Japan aims to combat money laundering and ensure greater transparency globally in cryptocurrency transactions. Additionally, by aligning with global standards, the Asian country will strengthen its position in the cryptocurrency industry, providing greater confidence to both investors and users.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that Japan&#8217;s <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/japan-tougher-crypto-regulations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cryptocurrency regulations</a> are among the strictest in the world, with rules on segregated holdings, leverage limits, and storage of customer funds in cold wallets. This is because Japan was one of the first countries to legalize the use of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>In March 2021, Japan&#8217;s Financial Services Agency <a href="https://www.fsa.go.jp/en/news/2021/20210331/01.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requested</a> the implementation of the travel rule for cryptocurrency exchanges in response to the hacking suffered by Mt. Gox, which resulted in thousands of people losing billions of dollars.</p>
<h2>The FATF Travel Rule Is Stricter than the One Implemented by Japan</h2>
<p>The FATF travel rule was issued in 2019 for the G-7, an organization consisting of the world&#8217;s seven largest economies, including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.</p>
<p>The controversial <a href="https://sumsub.com/blog/what-is-the-fatf-travel-rule/" target="_blank">rule</a> formally known as FATF Recommendation #16 requires virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to report on user transactions exceeding amounts of $1,000. This threshold may vary depending on each country&#8217;s regulations. For example, the reporting threshold in the United States is from $3,000.</p>
<p>The implementation of these stricter rules is related to <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/japan-north-korean-crypto-hacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple hacks</a> and market manipulation carried out by various actors in the crypto ecosystem, who have used digital assets to engage in illicit activities such as financing terrorism and sending money to sanctioned countries.</p>
<p>Therefore, the application of the FATF travel rule would help facilitate the tracing of cryptocurrencies by law enforcement, opening the doors to a more uniform global regulation.</p>
<p>However, one of the most significant challenges presented by this regulation is the exposure of user data, so it is crucial to establish security measures that protect those users who use cryptocurrencies on a daily basis as an alternative to fiat money and not for illegal activities.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/xpeng-shares-q1-2023-q2-forecast/">Xpeng Shares Slide 5% Following Weak Q1 2023 Outing &#038; Q2 Deliveries Forecast </a></p>
<p>The shares of Chinese electric vehicle (EV) giant <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/xpeng-motors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XPeng Motors</a> (NYSE: XPEV) slid 5% following missed <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xpeng-reports-first-quarter-2023-100000182.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Q1 earnings</a> and a gloomy delivery forecast.</p>
<p>Xpeng shares sank in US pre-market trade after the company reported a 50% year-over-year (YoY) decline in Q1 revenue. The company raked in income of 4.03 billion Chinese yuan ($571.6 million) compared to the 5.19 billion yuan analysts expected. For the first quarter of 2023, the Chinese Tesla rival also sustained a net loss of 2.34 billion yuan versus the 1.9 billion expected. Xpeng&#8217;s latest quarterly deficit exceeded the 1.7 billion yuan loss suffered in the same quarter last year.</p>
<p>Xpeng Chairman and Chief Executive Officer He Xiaopeng weighed in on the company&#8217;s quarterly performance, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;During the first quarter of 2023, I made changes to our strategy, organizational structure, and senior management team decisively. I am fully confident in taking our company into a virtuous cycle, driving product sales growth, team morale, customer satisfaction, and brand reputation over the next few quarters.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Xpeng Forecast Lower Q2 Vehicle Deliveries &amp; Revenue Haul amid Shares Slip</h2>
<p>With shares currently trading at $9.11, Xpeng forecast at most 22,000 vehicle deliveries in Q2. The company&#8217;s latest restrained delivery guidance of between 21,000 and 22,000 EVs represents a 36.1% to 39.0% YoY decrease. Additionally, Xpeng&#8217;s second-quarter forecast revenue of between 4.5 billion yuan and 4.7 billion yuan is a 36.8% to 39.5% YoY drawdown.</p>
<p>However, He remained optimistic about the company&#8217;s prospects, especially regarding its soon-to-be-released G6 SUV. The EV rolls off the assembly line next month, and the Xpeng CEO believes it will become a popular, best-selling model in China.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Xpeng Honorary Vice Chairman and Co-President Hongdi Brian Gu stressed the company&#8217;s commitment to achieving sustained profitability in a saturated market. Gu said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;[As we advance], our top priority remains to accelerate growth in sales and market share. As the upcoming G6 launch and other new product launches fuel rapid sales growth, we expect our cash flow from operations to improve significantly.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Xpeng&#8217;s recent less-than-stellar performance is due to debilitating macroeconomic parameters in China. This includes mixed consumer spending in an uneven economy still recovering from stringent Covid protocols. In addition, the Guangdong-based EV maker has also ceded some market share to rising competition from other EV companies. Xpeng&#8217;s competitors range from local to international, including China&#8217;s <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/byd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BYD</a>, Li Auto, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/nio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nio</a>, and the US <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/tesla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tesla</a> (NASDAQ: TSLA).</p>
<p>Although Tesla <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/tesla-price-model-s-x-cars-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently hiked the prices</a> of some of its EV models, the company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/tesla-price-cars-china-tsla-stock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous</a> price <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/price-cuts-tesla-model-3-model-y/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cuts</a> impacted Xpeng&#8217;s competitiveness.</p>
<h2>Europe Push</h2>
<p>In early February, Xpeng <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/xpeng-flagship-ev-models-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> its flagship electric vehicle models in Europe amid intensifying competition at home and abroad. The overseas push is to increase the Chinese company&#8217;s brand visibility and eke out a potentially lucrative foreign market share.</p>
<p>On February 3rd, Xpeng launched its P7 sedan and G9 SUVs in Denmark, Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden. At the time of the Europe launch, the Chinese EV manufacturer priced its P7 sedan below Tesla&#8217;s EVs.</p>

<p>Dan Berkowitz, a former commissioner of the CFTC and former general counsel at the SEC, hinted that it is possible to categorize Ethereum as both a commodity and a security.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/cftc-ethereum-commodity-security/">Former CFTC Commissioner: Ethereum Has Dual Regulatory Potential as Commodity and Security</a></p>
<p>As cryptocurrencies grow more popular, there is a rising need for clarity about their legal status, as many people see them differently based on the regulatory provisions within their jurisdiction. In what seems like an addition to the ongoing talks about the regulatory status of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a>, Dan Berkovitz, a former commissioner of the Commodities Future Trading Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/cftc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CFTC</a>), said in an interview on the May 23 edition of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvGOc_v7yGA" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">the unchained podcast</a> that Ethereum could be a security and, at the same time, a commodity.</p>
<p>According to him, Ethereum can fall under the Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>) and the CFTC regulatory provisions. While the former is making efforts to classify Ethereum clearly but tilts towards regarding it as a security, the latter regard it as a commodity.</p>
<h2>Explaining CFTC and SEC Overlapping Definitions</h2>
<p>Speaking further, he examined the definitions the two regulatory bodies provided for securities and commodities and identified some shared characteristics. According to the CFTC’s provision, a commodity is not strictly limited to tangible goods but includes any asset that is involved in a futures contract. The Securities and Exchange Commission’s definition of security also includes contracts subject to a futures contract, making it overlap with the CFTC’s definition.</p>
<p>Since CFTC&#8217;s definition allows them to see ETH as a commodity and the SEC sees it as a security, it is ok to regard the crypto as both a commodity and a security that the two bodies should regulate.</p>
<p>Collin Lloyd, a Sullivan &amp; Cromwell partner, who was also on the podcast, did not agree with the SEC&#8217;s position that all cryptocurrencies except <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> should be regarded as a security.  He stated that he had not seen any legal precedent backing the idea that a sequence of numbers on a blockchain should automatically be considered a security.</p>
<p>The regulatory status of cryptocurrencies remains a major concern within the crypto industry. Each step and discussion taken to establish their proper regulatory status bring us closer to finding a lasting solution. The May 23 episode of the Unchained podcast aimed to contribute to solving this issue.</p>

<p>For Q1 2023, Xiaomi sold far fewer smartphones than in the first quarter of last year due to waning demand. </p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/xiaomi-q1-2023-report/">Xiaomi Q1 2023 Report Reveals Leading Smartphone Market Took Hit on Poor Product Sales</a></p>
<p>Xiaomi Corporation recently posted its Q1 2023 earnings report, which saw its revenue plunge 18.9% amid a wane in global smartphone demand. On Wednesday, the Chinese consumer electronics designer and manufacturer reported first-quarter sales of 59.5 billion yuan ($8.61 billion). Xiaomi’s Q1 2023 sales figure was roughly in line with the 59.43 billion yuan analysts expected for the period. However, this figure paled compared to the 73.35-billion-yuan worth of sales recorded in the 2022 first quarter.</p>
<p>For Q1 2023, Xiaomi experienced a 13.1% year-over-year (YoY) net income rise to 3.23 billion. In the first quarter of last year, the Beijing-based company logged a net income haul of 2.86 billion yuan.</p>
<p>Xiaomi’s first-quarter outing came amid easing pandemic restrictions by the Chinese government. However, consumers are still spending cautiously despite the country’s ongoing recovery post-Covid. This trend has impacted China’s smartphone sector, with total sales <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-android-rivals-see-q1-drop-china-phone-shipments-research-firm-2023-04-26/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">falling</a> 11% in the year’s first quarter on weak consumer demand. Even India, once Xiaomi’s most lucrative foreign market, is proving less lucrative for the Chinese consumer electronics brand. The company has marked down the prices of several smartphone products in India and China to induce higher sales. However, this move has reaped little dividend in the ensuing time, with rival companies, including <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/samsung/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samsung</a>, eating into Xiaomi’s market share.</p>
<h2>Analysts Probe Recent Smartphone Sales Underperformance</h2>
<p>Last month, Canalys analyst Sanyam Chaurasia weighed in on the decline in the global smartphone market in Q1 2023. According to Chaurasia, this underwhelming run is unsurprising because economic conditions have yet to improve globally. The analyst said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The local macroeconomic conditions continued to hinder vendors’ investments and operations in several markets. Despite price cuts and heavy promotions from vendors, consumer demand remained sluggish, particularly in the low-end segment due to high inflation affecting consumer confidence and spending.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, Chaurasia said that “the continuous sluggish end-user demand has triggered a major wave of destocking across the entire supply chain”.</p>
<p>In his opinion, vendors reduced inventory levels to secure operations, including low sell-in volume. Chaurasia added that presently-deployed smartphone production techniques also negatively impact supply-chain operational performance in the long term.</p>
<p>However, another Canalys analyst Toby Zhu previously forecasted the smartphone market would pick up at the end of the second quarter. Although it is too early to predict overall consumer demand recovery, Zhu opined that industry inventory could attain a “healthy [sales] level” by Q2 2023. He added that this positive uptick would occur irrespective of the smartphone channel or vendor.</p>
<p>Zhu pointed out that vendors remain more focused on innovations and increasing production and channel strengths following the underwhelming phase.</p>
<h2>Xiaomi Looks Beyond Consumer Electronics amid Its Restrained Q1 2023 Outing</h2>
<p>Xiaomi is the second-largest smartphone manufacturer in the world, behind <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/huawei/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Huawei</a>. However, the company has begun investing in the automotive sector to increase its income and diversify from consumer electronics. Reports say the publicly-traded Chinese company would mass produce its first vehicle in the first half of next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/europe-startup-ecosystem-growing/">Europe Startup Ecosystem Growing amid Broader Industry Strain</a></p>
<p>Europe&#8217;s startup ecosystem has matured significantly, and despite challenges faced by the tech industry, the region is witnessing a rise in startup mafias.</p>
<p>According to new <a href="https://assets.website-files.com/5f217a8e6bc2c8058e803083/646cc6974ca3e5d9651da2ff_%5BAccel%20x%20Dealroom%5D%20Europe%20and%20Israel%E2%80%99s%20%20startup%20founder%20factories%20and%20the%20founder%20journey.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reports</a> from the venture capital firm Accel, Europe, and Israel produced an average of five tech companies for every venture-backed company worth $1 billion or more. Based on the details, 221 of the region&#8217;s 353 Venture Capital-backed unicorns have fueled 1,171 new tech-enabled firms, with former employees becoming founders.</p>
<p>Accordingly, startups founded by former European and Israeli unicorn employees already have 59% of VC-secured funding, 45% have raised between $1 million to $10 million, and 30% have raised over $10 million.</p>
<p>The continuous success of well-known founder factories such as Criteo SA (NASDAQ: CRTO), Delivery Hero SE (ETR: DHER), and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/spotify/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spotify Technology SA</a> (NYSE: SPOT), which have continually produced successful entrepreneurs, has enriched Europe&#8217;s startup environment. From the reports’ findings, Spotify gave birth to 32 new businesses, Delivery Hero 32, and Criteo 31.</p>
<p>These businesses have fostered brilliant individuals who have obtained valuable experience and skills, as well as access to resources and networks. Their alumni have gone on to found new firms, adding to Europe&#8217;s startup environment.</p>
<p>However, a new generation of founder factories is rising in Europe. Alumni from organizations like Glovo, King Global Ventures Inc (CVE: KING), Babylon Holdings Ltd (NYSE: BBLN), and Wefox are making their mark by creating innovative firms. Remarkably, these founder companies are producing a fresh wave of entrepreneurs who bring their experience and expertise from these successful companies into their new ventures.</p>
<p>Notably, such businesses are referred to as “mafias” in the startup sector. Interestingly, the largest cohort of freshly minted startup mafias comes from fintech, with over 20% of European startups spun off of unicorns functioning in the industry. According to Accel, it currently takes startups in Europe just seven years on average to become unicorns.</p>
<h2>Factors Fueling the Europe Startup Ecosystem Growth</h2>
<p>While commenting on the report findings, Harry Nelis, a partner at Accel highlighted that the European and Israeli tech ecosystems are experiencing a true coming of age.</p>
<p>According to Nelis, the transition has been fueled by a number of factors, including access to top-tier talent, a favorable regulatory framework, and increased capital inflows into the region during the last two decades.</p>
<p>Over the years, Europe has witnessed the rise of great startups such as Spotify, and Skype Communications which have not only generated enormous money but have also nurtured an entrepreneurial culture. As a result, talented individuals who have earned significant experience and connections through these organizations are more likely to collaborate and launch their own businesses.</p>
<p>Additionally, the number of European venture capital firms and international investors interested in the region has increased significantly. This inflow of cash has supplied entrepreneurs with the financial backing they need to develop and scale their businesses, hence contributing to the formation of startup mafias.</p>
<h2>Dark Times for the Tech Industry</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, the tech startup sector has recently faced challenges due to rising interest rates, which have put pressure on valuations, especially for late-stage companies. As interest rates rise, investors tend to reassess the risk-reward profile of their investments, including in the tech sector.</p>
<p>This reevaluation has resulted in a decline in market value for some prominent firms, such as <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/klarna/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Klarna</a>, and has continued to impact the overall outlook for tech startups.</p>

<p>Crop commodities, including orange juice, are bullish following several underperforming weeks and could hit record highs May-ending. </p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/orange-juice-futures-price/">Orange Juice Futures Price Trajectory Up as February Record High of $3 Signals</a></p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/orange-juice-futures-price/">Orange Juice Futures Price Trajectory Up as February Record High of $3 Signals</a></p>
<p>Orange Juice futures climbed 29% this year and <a href="https://www.investing.com/analysis/orange-juice-new-3-record-high-on-charts-before-swing-lower-200638337" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">is fully recovering</a> following the volatility that succeeded its record highs. The world benchmark FCOJ (Frozen Concentrated Orange Juice Futures) contract remains firmly rooted among raw materials with double-digit gains for 2023. Amid this development, agriculture-focused financial services provider Rabobank noted that FCOJ bulls could shoot for a new $3 record high. However, Rabobank also cautioned that this potential bull rush could trigger another price fall in the global frozen concentrated orange juice market.</p>
<p>Rabobank ascribed this year’s record-high orange juice prices to a tight market with less-than-anticipated production and low inventories. However, the agriculture-based financial platform believes the decline in the commodity’s demand will accelerate in 2023 amid soaring prices and waning consumer demand.</p>
<p>Crop commodities are pressing ahead with momentum, unaffected by the ongoing US banking and debt crisis. This upswing could be due to the relatively low exposure of these commodities compared to the more popular oil and gold. The price of robusta beans is up 40% this year, while cocoa and arabica coffee are up 16% and 13% year-to-date, respectively. Furthermore, besides FCOJ, the price of raw sugar and feeder cattle are also up 29% in 2023.</p>
<h2>Orange Juice to Revisit Record High at The End of May</h2>
<p>An interesting point can be made in the case of frozen concentrated orange juice. The commodity is en route to ending May in positive territory following serial losses since February. When its losses began, FCOJ was trading at a record high of approximately $2.88 a pound.</p>
<p>The FCOJ monthly chart indicates that bulls would drive the price up to revisit its previous all-time high at the end of the month. However, the commodity’s price could tumble once more after cresting at $3, creating a rinse-&amp;-repeat price cycle.</p>
<p>In Tuesday’s New York pre-trade, FCOJ for July delivery traded at around $2.68. This is higher than last week’s two-month low of $2.41.</p>
<p>Price Futures Group chief crop analyst Jack Scoville commented on the orange juice record high trajectory development. Explaining that FCOJ bulls seek to hike price action amid a tight production estimate in Florida, Scoville said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Demand is thought to be backing away from FCOJ with prices as high as they are currently, but the market has not taken any note and continues to work higher. Historically low estimates of production due in part to the hurricanes and in part to the greening disease that have hurt production, but conditions are significantly better now with scattered showers and moderate temperatures.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The Chicago-based chief crop analyst also added that global weather favored citrus production now, including in Florida. The US southeastern state has been experiencing torrential rainfall and stormy periods. Nonetheless, Scoville remains convinced that the citrus production outlook is favorable. He pointed out that the world’s prime citrus grower Brazil also experienced rain, yet its conditions remain rated good.</p>

<p>Adobe and Activision Blizzard, two of the biggest names in the technology industry, have introduced new generative artificial intelligence tools designed to assist humans.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/adobe-blizzard-generative-ai-tools/">Adobe and Blizzard Unveils Generative AI Tools to Enhance Human Productivity</a></p>
<p>Leading technology giants Adobe and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/blizzard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Activision Blizzard</a> have introduced generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools to improve human creativity, not replace them. The move aims to streamline processes and empower artists and designers to produce high-quality content.</p>
<p>Adobe, the renowned graphic software maker, introduced its new AI tool, &#8220;Generative Fill&#8221;, on May 23, 2023. The tool is incorporated into its flagship product Photoshop.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/solana-ai-chatgpt-plug-in/">AI</a> uses algorithmic patterns to create new and unique content based on a user&#8217;s command. The software allows graphic designers to <a href="https://twitter.com/Adobe/status/1660964405893541888?s=20" target="_blank">create</a> &#8220;extraordinary imagery&#8221; using a simple text prompt. Similarly, users can add, expand, or remove unwanted images using text prompts.</p>
<h2>Adobe Takes Precaution to Distinguish between Humans and AI Contents</h2>
<p>Adobe&#8217;s generative AI software comes amidst growing concerns that AI could replace humans and take their jobs. The company, however, has assured users that the artificial intelligence was designed to be supportive and not replace humans, noting the tool will be a &#8220;co-pilot&#8221; for artists to enhance their workflow.</p>
<p>Chandra Sinnathamby, the company&#8217;s Asia-Pacific director of digital media and strategy, highlighted that the tool&#8217;s purpose is to accelerate the design process rather than replace graphic designers altogether.</p>
<p>Additionally, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/adobe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adobe</a> has taken precautions to ensure a clear distinction between human-made content and AI-generated content.</p>
<p>Furthermore, contributing artists will receive compensation when the AI uses their stock photos.</p>
<h2>Create Addictive and Empathetic Experiences for Users</h2>
<p>Activision Blizzard, on the other hand, is also exploring the use of AI technology to assist in-game designs, according to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/22/arts/blizzard-diffusion-ai-video-games.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a> in the New York Times.</p>
<p>According to the report, the company, which is the brains behind the creation of popular games such as Diablo, World of Warcraft, and Overwatch, shared the announcement in an email to employees last month. In the mail, Allen Adham, Blizzard&#8217;s chief design officer, revealed their interest in developing an image-generating AI tool dubbed Blizzard Diffusion.</p>
<p>The tool aims to eliminate repetitive and manual tasks, allowing artists to allocate more time to unleash their creativity.</p>
<p>Though the technology is still in its early stages of development, it is expected to enhance the productivity and efficiency of creative teams.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are on the brink of a major evolution in how we build and manage our games,&#8221; Adham told employees in the email.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s president, Mike Ybarra, also <a href="https://twitter.com/Qwik/status/1654542974276206609?t=XlnAyRBYR9lZejlU7UNgiA&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> on Twitter that Blizzard plans to utilize machine learning and AI to create an addictive and empathetic experience, enabling its team to dedicate more time to exceptional creative thinking and tasks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, adopting AI technology is not limited to Adobe and Activision Blizzard. Nikesh Arora, the CEO of Palo Alto Networks, recently shared the advantages of generative AI for cybersecurity during an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/23/palo-alto-networks-ceo-lauds-generative-ai-as-boon-for-efficiency-.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">appearance</a> on Mad Money with Jim Cramer on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Arora believes that implementing this technology will increase efficiency and enable the security firm to grow without needing a proportional increase in the number of employees.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/uk-inflation-first-time-august-2022/">UK Inflation Drops Under 10% for First Time since August 2022</a></p>
<p>As per the latest reports, the UK inflation has taken fresh dive under 10% for the last month of April 2023. This happened as the energy price retreated and the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine started to subside on the annual consumer price comparison.</p>
<p>Earlier on Wednesday, May 24, the Office for National Statistics said that the headline CPI inflation came in at 8.7% year-on-year. This was a substantial drop from 10.1% in March. However, it was still above the consensus estimates of 8.2% as polled by Reuters economists. In its report, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Electricity and gas prices contributed 1.42 percentage points to the fall in annual inflation in April as last April’s rise dropped out of the annual comparison, but this component still contributed 1.01 percentage points to annual inflation. Food and non-alcoholic beverage prices continued to rise in April and contributed to high annual inflation, however, the annual inflation rate of food and non-alcoholic beverages eased, from 19.2% in the year to March 2023, to 19.1% in the year to April 2023.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Also, on a monthly basis, consumer prices rose by 1.2%, above the consensus estimate of 0.8%. For the 12 months period to April 2023, the Consumer Prices Index including owner occupiers’ housing costs (CPIH) rose by 7.8%. Also, the core CPI jumped to 6.8%, up from 6.2% in March. this will be a major point of concern for the British central bank.</p>
<p>As we know, British inflation has been stubborn forcing the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/bank-of-england/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bank of England</a> to continue its interest rate hikes to 4.5%, for the 12th consecutive time. Economists are expecting further hikes in the upcoming meetings as inflation in the UK remains sticky in comparison to other major economies.</p>
<h2>BoE to Continue Its Fight Against Inflation</h2>
<p>With inflation sticky and the labor market tight, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey recently warned about a wage-price spiral. On Tuesday, Bailey admitted to the bank&#8217;s failure to properly forecast the strength of inflation.</p>
<p>Commenting on the recent development, British Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the falling headline rate was “welcome news”, but that there are “things underneath those numbers which show that this battle is far from over&#8221;.</p>
<p>Hunt added that we have a &#8220;long way to go&#8221;. Economists expect the headline inflation rate to drop further in the summer in the UK. energy regulator Ofgem is likely to reduce its energy price cap, driving down bills from July onwards. Suren Thiru, economics director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/24/uk-inflation-sinks-below-10percent-for-the-first-time-since-august.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>:</p>
<div class="group">
<blockquote><p>“April’s decline in inflation is large enough for the Monetary Policy Committee to keep interest rates on hold next month, but if they continue to risk overtightening, it could worsen the cost-of-living crisis and the squeeze on businesses.”</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase</a> has announced that it <a href="https://twitter.com/yugacohler/status/1661057313678016526" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">released</a> and launched a new Web3 wallet solution dubbed “Wallet as a Service” (WaaS) on the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a> mainnet. The new service, a version of the crypto firm’s cloud product, went live on May 23 and utilizes a multi-party computation (MPC), according to a Twitter announcement from a software developer at the company.</p>
<p>The Coinbase engineer also noted that the new service is a direct-to-end-user product. WaaS (Wallet as a Service) reportedly employs cutting-edge multi-party computing (MPC) technology to safeguard the private keys of its users. It is equipped with MPC for both key generation and message signing, which ensures the maximum security properties of these decentralized algorithms.</p>
<p>According to the post, customers using the MPC wallet solution can create, access, and recover their wallets with just a username and password. Coinbase initially launched this offering in March, selling it as a means for companies to provide their customers with “fully customizable on-chain wallets&#8221;.</p>
<p>Coinbase representatives at that time, emphasized that the use of Multi-Party Computation (MPC) cryptographic technology empowers end users to engage with Web3 without the need to handle a complex 24-word recovery phrase.</p>
<p>MPC solutions are commonly known to divide the private key associated with a wallet into multiple shards. These shards can then be distributed among multiple owners, ensuring the secure storage of their digital assets.</p>
<p>The MPCTransactionService, another unique feature of WaaS, according to the Twitter announcement, “implements a complex state machine to fulfill MPC-signed transactions from construction to confirmation. It handles re-orgs, replacements, retries, and more”.</p>
<p>WaaS also boasts of the option of Web3 interactions via APIs and SDKs, as well as support for ERC-721 and ERC-1155 for NFT holders, as these users can mint PFP NFT, distribute fan loyalty points, or build an in-game item with only a few REST API calls.</p>
<p>A variety of digital assets can be purchased with Coinbase&#8217;s Pay SDK. According to the exchange, a second Coinbase API makes it easier for companies to incorporate cryptocurrency-based payments, including <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-decentralized-finance-defi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeFi</a> solutions.</p>
<p>Coinbase’s recent product unveilings look to be giving the company a boost amidst its ongoing legal troubles with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>). ENS Domains has reportedly integrated the crypto firm’s wallet-as-a-service product.</p>
<p>In May, the Ethereum-based naming service joined forces with Moonpay, with the collaboration allowing users to purchase .eth domain names with fiat.</p>
<p>Speaking on the recent developments around ENS and its integration with Waas, a representative for Coinbase told reporters that there is “more to come”.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Coinbase disclosed plans to <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coinbase-singapore-us-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expand</a> in Singapore in addition to its prior plans to create a derivatives exchange in <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coinbase-derivatives-exchange-bermuda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bermuda</a>. The cryptocurrency exchange plans to increase its international presence in 35 countries and has expanded its Coinbase One subscription service to the UK, Germany, and Ireland.</p>
