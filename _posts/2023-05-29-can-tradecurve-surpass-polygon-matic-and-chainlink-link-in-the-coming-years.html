<p>Well-established crypto projects have become sluggish in terms of growth. Therefore, investors are looking for young projects, like Tradecurve, which are setting new records.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although Polygon (MATIC) and Chainlink (LINK) have worked on improving their ecosystem, their value has been in the red zone. Therefore, holders of MATIC and LINK have started to shed their tokens to add TCRV to their investment portfolio.</p>

<p>Polygon (MATIC) Joins Hands With De.Fi</p>
<p>To protect its ecosystems from issues like smart contract vulnerabilities, phishing, blind signing, and others, Polygon (MATIC) has collaborated with De.Fi. Under this partnership, Polygon (MATIC) will integrate De.Fi&rsquo;s antivirus into its ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The antivirus will include tools like De.Fi Shield, which will scan smart contract approvals, and downloaded files in the Polygon (MATIC) ecosystem. It will also enable Polygon (MATIC) users to assess the security of non-fungible tokens, or staking vaults.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The price of Polygon (MATIC) has responded positively to the news. Polygon (MATIC) has risen by more than 1% on the weekly price chart. Currently, Polygon (MATIC) is available to trade at $0.86.</p>

<p>Coinbase Cloud Joins Chainlink (LINK)</p>
<p>Chainlink&rsquo;s (LINK) ecosystem has been expanding, and Coinbase Cloud is a new player to join it. Chainlink (LINK) has been working on improving its network efficiency to attract more users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is necessary as Chainlink (LINK) has been plummeting on the price charts for quite some time. The market value of Chainlink has dropped by 11% in the past month, and LINK is currently trading at $6.30.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the recent announcement by Chainlink (LINK), Coinbase Cloud will become a node operator on its system. Under this collaboration, Coinbase Cloud will use its infrastructure to strengthen the security of Chainlink&rsquo;s (LINK) oracle network. Chainlink (LINK) has big names on its roster of node operators, including Associated Press, Deutsche Telekom, and Swisscom.</p>

<p>Tradecurve Wins Market Trust With Its Growth Potential</p>
<p>Currently, there are about 600 crypto exchanges, and the number of users is expected to increase from 420 million (2022) to more than 994 million by 2027. Thus, crypto exchanges can witness a surge in their adoption over the coming years. But one platform that is set to attract the most number of traders is the newly launched Tradecurve.</p>
<p>Earlier, traders had to create multiple accounts on different platforms to trade derivatives. However, on Tradecurve, users can trade cryptocurrencies, indices, Forex, CFDs, Options, and other derivatives with a single account. Therefore, it is destined to become one of the top three global trading exchanges.</p>
<p>Besides, existing trading exchanges, such as Binance and Bittrex have been caught up in intense legal scrutiny. Hence, traders are opting for Tradecurve for a safe and stable trading experience. TCRV will power the ecosystem, and its holders will get bonuses, discounts, and exclusive rewards. They can also earn rewards by staking their tokens to the platform&rsquo;s liquidity pool, which will be locked for two years.</p>
<p>The platform is moving towards raising $20 million during the presale phase, which is significantly higher than the ICO of Binance. A TCRV token is currently available for $0.015, and is expected to soar by 50x during the presale.</p>
