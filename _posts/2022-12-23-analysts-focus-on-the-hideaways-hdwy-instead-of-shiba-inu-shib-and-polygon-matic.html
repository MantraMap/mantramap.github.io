<p>Finding a currency that can make investors money is becoming increasingly difficult as many coins are produced daily. You might be wondering right now if famous cryptocurrencies still generate earnings.</p>
<p>Various crypto analysts believe that the answer is no. After FTX and BlockFi fell, these cryptocurrencies could not sustain the strain and have fallen sharply. Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Polygon (MATIC) were some of those caught in the downtrend.</p>
<p>But a new presale for The Hideaways has created some hype behind it. Let's look at the factors that might cause this coin to rise in 2023! </p>
<p class="s8">Shiba Inu (SHIB) Down 22% In the Last Three Months</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies with canine themes have been proliferating over the past year. Shiba Inu(SHIB) is one such canine coin. Shiba Inu (SHIB) has attracted significant internet followers because it is a "meme coin."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this hype has not resulted in a significant price point for Shiba Inu (SHIB). It has a price of $0.000008714, a 22% loss in the past three months. Bears still have Shiba Inu (SHIB) in their palm, and an investment in it at this time is not a good idea. According to some analysts, The Hideaways will be a better alternative in 2023. </p>
<p class="s8">Polygon (MATIC) Still Stuck In A Bear Market </p>
<p>Polygon (MATIC) was developed as a scalable mechanism to address several issues with the blockchain network, notably trading costs. Many blockchain platforms like Avalanche and Polkadot have features that Polygon (MATIC) shares.</p>
<p>Polygon (MATIC) has had a tough year, as its price dropped by 63% in the last 12 months. And with the 11% weekly fall that occurred, Polygon (MATIC) is a high-risk asset that you should avoid. And investors are also noticing that, putting their funds in The Hideaways. </p>
<p class="s8">The Hideaways (HDWY) Price Will Drastically Increase</p>
<p>What makes The Hideaways stop going down the road that Polygon (MATIC) and Shiba Inu(SHIB) are now going? Let's take a closer look: </p>
● The Hideaways will generate an NFT backed by a real property that provides rental income.
● The Hideaways will deliver passive income to investors through ETH and USDT. 
● All members will be a part of monthly prize drops.
