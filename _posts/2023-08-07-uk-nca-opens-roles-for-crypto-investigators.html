<p>The UK&rsquo;s National Crime Agency (NCA) began advertising roles to expand its cryptocurrency investigation team. </p>
<p>The UK&rsquo;s National Crime Agency (NCA) is actively recruiting for senior roles to carry out cryptocurrency investigations.</p>
<p>The NCA seeks to expand its task force on digital asset investigations and has posted four job opportunities on its website. The NCA appoints four senior investigators to join its Complex Financial Crime Team (CFTC) to assist with digital asset-related crimes.</p>
<p>The CFTC &ldquo;conducts high-end proactive illicit finance investigations,&rdquo; and the newly advertised roles fall under the scope of its newly formed Digital Assets Team (DAT). The DAT will ensure &ldquo;complex investigations into Blockchain-enabled crime are fully in compliance with the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 (CPIA).&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to the NCA website,</p>

<p>&ldquo;It involves enquiries into criminal activity within virtual arenas, high end of high harm cryptocurrency and virtual assets fraud and money laundering offences carried out by significant organised crime groups and state actors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The positions require individuals to work alongside and collaborate with CPS, investigators, intelligence and analysis staff to ensure disclosure requirements are accordingly dealt with.</p>
UK Sets Up Investigative Unit to Deal With Illicit Crypto-Related Activities
<p>Along with the need for a more comprehensive need for crypto regulation, so too does the market exist for teams and agencies to investigate crypto-related activities. The UK&rsquo;s NCA established its digital asset team earlier this year due to the massive investor losses incurred by numerous scandals that shook the industry.</p>
<p>The country&rsquo;s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) undertook a mission to shut down all illicit crypto ATM sites and successfully put an end to 26 locations in July.</p>
<p>The UK has also made strides in crypto regulation. The UK Parliament passed a bill last month that could help authorities seize and freeze cryptocurrencies that have been used in criminal activities.</p>
