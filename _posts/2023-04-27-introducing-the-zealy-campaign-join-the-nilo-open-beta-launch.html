<p>We are thrilled to announce the launch of our Zealy campaign for the upcoming Nilo Open Beta Launch, featuring the dynamic NFT Nilo Avatar, Smart Toothbrush, and mobile app. Designed to make oral health fun and engaging, Nilo is a Smart Toothbrush and a digital companion that rewards users with tokens and digital collectibles as they prioritize their oral health. Nilo, inspired by Tamagotchis, combines cutting-edge oral care technology with a playful and interactive digital experience that makes caring for your teeth a rewarding daily habit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Discover the World of Nilo: Brush-to-Earn</p>
<p></p>
<p>Nilo is revolutionizing oral care by combining a Smart Toothbrush with a digital collectible companion. By using the Nilo Smart Toothbrush, you earn Brushing Experience Points (BXP) for your dynamic NFT avatar. These earned BXP entitle you to a portion of the weekly NLT distribution based on the global BXP earned from active brushing. More details on what makes the Nilo token economy unique will be available soon.</p>
<p>The Nilo Smart Toothbrush and the app also offer users a wide range of rewards, such as Nilo NLT tokens that can be used to level up your avatar, purchase digital items, and even save on real-world oral care expenses. With Nilo's 'Brush-to-Earn' model, brushing your teeth is an exciting earning opportunity encouraging users to maintain their oral health.</p>
