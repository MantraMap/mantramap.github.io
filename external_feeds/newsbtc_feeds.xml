					<description><![CDATA[In a significant legal victory for Ripple, the Southern District of New York has ruled that the company&#8217;s programmatic sales and other distributions of XRP did not constitute an offer and sale of investment contracts.  However, the court found that Ripple&#8217;s institutional sales of XRP did constitute an unregistered offer and sale of investment contracts in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act. According to analyst Adam Cochran, the ruling is mostly excellent news for Ripple and XRP, providing greater regulatory clarity and paving the way for increased cryptocurrency adoption.  The court found that sales to users via exchanges “were fine” if they were conducted through order books and not ICO/IEO/Launchpad-like platforms. Other activities, such as bounties, investments in others using XRP, grants using XRP, and transfers to executives in XRP, were also not considered securities. Related Reading: Polygon Upgrade Proposal Pushes Price Over 5%, Is It Too Late To Buy? XRP has long been considered one of the more centralized foundations in cryptocurrency, with a key figurehead and standard sales via exchanges. According to Cochran, the court&#8217;s ruling suggests that if XRP is not a security, then neither are Bitcoin or Ethereum.  Furthermore, Cochran believes The ruling is also a win for exchanges, as it suggests that all selling will flow through public order books again, with no more billions in convertible funding rounds early on. This could make it easier for investors to trade XRP and other cryptocurrencies on regulated exchanges. XRP Price Rises As Ripple Wins Legal Battle Against SEC The recent ruling in favor of Ripple represents a significant legal victory, and the market has positively received the news. XRP&#8217;s price has notably increased since the ruling, with the cryptocurrency experiencing gains of over 33% in the hours following the announcement. What’s more, Institutional investors have been cautious about investing in XRP due to the ongoing legal battle with the SEC, which has created uncertainty around the regulatory status of the cryptocurrency.  Related Reading: Circle To Lay Off Staff And Refocus On Core Activities The recent ruling provides greater clarity and certainty, which could help to alleviate some of these concerns and make XRP a more attractive option for institutional investors. As of the time of writing, XRP has reached a significant milestone by hitting the $0.6324 mark, which has not been achieved since May 2022. This new yearly high is a positive indication of the cryptocurrency&#8217;s continued uptrend.  The ADX, a technical indicator that measures the strength of a trend, is currently spiking to the upside, suggesting a potential continuation of XRP&#8217;s upward momentum. XRP&#8217;s squeeze-bear momentum indicator also shows the beginning of a significant move to the upside, indicating that the cryptocurrency may be poised for further gains. These factors could be the perfect ingredients for XRP to reach the $1 mark. Despite the cryptocurrency&#8217;s optimism, XRP faces two major resistance levels shortly. The first resistance wall is $0.7769, which could be the first obstacle to the $1 mark. The second, more challenging wall is the $0.8627 level, which has not been reached since the first quarter of 2022. This surge in price marks a significant turnaround for XRP, which had been struggling in the wake of the SEC lawsuit. The ruling is likely to positively impact investor sentiment, as it provides greater clarity and certainty around the regulatory status of the token.

					<description><![CDATA[Ripple is best known for its XRP cryptocurrency and global payments network, but it is now setting its sights on the tokenized assets market. In its 2023 New Value report, the company believes blockchain technology can unlock trillions of dollars of value in the global financial system by tokenizing real-world assets like stocks, bonds, and real estate. Ripple Wants To Get In On The Action Tokenized digital representation of assets like stocks, bonds, real estate, art, and commodities provide more efficiency, liquidity, and accessibility on DeFi protocols. And Ripple has big plans for the tokenized assets market. Related Reading: Polygon Upgrade Proposal Pushes Price Over 5%, Is It Too Late To Buy? The company believes that the tokenization of global illiquid assets could be a $16 trillion business opportunity by 2030. So to position itself, Ripple is building tools and services for tokenizing assets and facilitating blockchain-based trading. Earlier this month, the company&#8217;s CBDC advisor, Anthony Welfare, posted on Twitter that Ripple&#8217;s CBDC team is focusing on real-world use cases for a CBDC or stablecoin on Ripple’s CBDC Platform. This will allow users to tokenize real estate as collateral for loans.  Recently, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority invited Ripple Labs to participate in a pilot initiative for the tokenization of real estate assets. According to the company, its CBDC Platform was selected to assist the HKMA in creating a tokenization solution that records e-HKD real estate transactions on a secure and private ledger using its CBDC Platform &#8211; a new private ledger distinct from the XRP Ledger.  Coincidentally, Ripple is not the only entity seeing growth in this niche of the industry. According to the Boston Consulting Group, tokenized illiquid assets can reach $16.1 trillion by 2030. Around 72% of finance decision-makers expect to explore tokenization as a way to drive innovation over the next three years. A survey of 300+ global institutional clients by Celent showed reported 97% of respondents agree that tokenization will revolutionize asset management and would be good for the industry. XRP Standing Strong Ripple has faced uncertainty in the past due to an ongoing legal battle with the SEC. Despite the unclear regulatory environment, Ripple continues expanding into new areas, like the tokenized assets sector. Today, Ripple secured another win as United States District Judge Analisa Torres ruled in partial favor of Ripple, saying that XRP sales on public cryptocurrency exchanges were not offers of securities under the law.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ripple is best known for its XRP cryptocurrency and global payments network, but it is now setting its sights on the tokenized assets market. In its 2023 New Value report, the company believes blockchain technology can unlock trillions of dollars of value in the global financial system by tokenizing real-world assets like stocks, bonds, and real estate.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[On July 13, Ripple triumphed significantly in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on the XRP case. Judge Analisa Torres ruled in favor of Ripple in a case originally initiated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2020. Related Reading: Circle To Lay Off Staff And Refocus On Core Activities In recently filed documents on July 13, Judge Torres issued a summary judgment, decisively supporting payment company Ripple and its claim over the SEC. The judgment affirms that XRP token sales made by the payment company, at the center of the case, are not classified as a security. The decision immediately impacted the XRP price, which surged over 35% in the wake of the ruling. The ruling cleared a substantial part of Ripple&#8217;s operations from being targeted by the SEC&#8217;s crackdown. The court&#8217;s decision acknowledged that the Programmatic Sales and sales made by Ripple executives Chris Larsen and Brad Garlinghouse do not qualify as investment contracts. However, the ruling only partially resolves the legal dispute with the SEC. The court has invalidated the investment contract designation for Programmatic Sales and other forms of distributions, but other items remain disputed. The value of XRP has surged from $0.45 to $0.62. This price surge has caused XRP to reach a yearly high. The coin attained this price level in early May of the preceding year. XRP Price Analysis: One-Day Chart On the daily chart, XRP has experienced an impressive 34% increase, trading at $0.62. Over the week, XRP has gained nearly 30%. However, as of the time of writing, the token was considered oversold. It suggests that a price retracement may be possible in the upcoming trading sessions. In the past, when XRP reached $0.60, the price suffered a sharp drop shortly after that. The coin faces overhead resistance at $0.67. Moving above this level could help XRP retain its gains for longer. If there is a price pullback, the first line of support is $0.57. A drop below this level would take XRP down to $0.50. The technical outlook indicates excessive bullish strength, with demand and accumulation showing significant positivity. The Relative Strength Index is above 80, which suggests that the token is overbought and overvalued, increasing the likelihood of a price retracement. However, demand is expected to remain positive if the price stays above the 20-Simple Moving Average line (red), which coincides with the $0.58 price mark.

					<description><![CDATA[Over the last day, the price of the Polygon native token, MATIC, has been on the rise, pushed upward by a single upgrade proposal. With the proposal gaining traction, will the price continue to rise, and is it too late to buy MATIC? New Proposal To Change MATIC To POL In an interesting turn of events, Polygon founders have suggested an overhaul of the Layer-2 blockchain’s native MATIC token in favor of a new token. The proposal involves upgrading the current token in an effort to change and improve its capabilities, which transcends just its native chain to other chains. Related Reading: Litecoin Becomes 10th-Largest Cryptocurrency, But Is There Still Room To Run? A new token name (POL) was proposed in lieu of MATIC, which much better reflects the Polygon name. The upgrade is centered on this POL token which would allow for better scalability as well as help to bring more rewards for Polygon’s validators. The token would be operable across all Polygon networks, such as Polygon’s main blockchain and Polygon’s zkEVM, in addition to other supernets that run on Polygon. Polygon says it plans to create three new layers of rewards for its validators, including transaction fees, protocol rewards, as well as other rewards to be made available to validate across multiple chains. Basically, the POL token will be to incentivize the validators who help to secure the network. MATIC price up 5% in one day &#124; Source: MATICUSD on Tradingview.com The proposal by the founders is yet to pass as the Polygon community will still need to vote on it. However, if it does pass, the founders have proposed that all MATIC holders will be provided up to four years to exchange their tokens for POL. Polygon Token Price Soars Following the announcement of this proposal, the price of Polygon’s MATIC token has responded positively. The token which had been trading sideways for most of this week quickly saw a reversal and recorded over 5% in daily gains. MATIC’s gains so far have seen it emerge as the second-highest gainer on Coinmarketmap, following behind SingularityNET’s AGIX. The price has now moved from trending below $0.73 to sitting firmly above $0.76 at the time of this writing. MATIC is second-highest gainer on Coinmarketcap &#124; Source: Coinmarketcap However, despite the price increase, the price of MATIC still sits considerably lower than it did five months ago. Given that its price is sitting almost 50% lower than its February high of $1.5, this could present an opportunity to take advantage of MATIC’s low price.

If the proposal passes, then it could be bullish for the digital asset, as already demonstrated over the past day. And if the crypto market continues to recover, then MATIC could be looking toward breaking the $1 resistance in the near term.

					<description><![CDATA[Circle, the company behind the USDC stablecoin, has recently laid off a portion of its workforce amid a turbulent year for the digital asset industry. According to the company, the recent layoffs aimed to maintain a strong balance sheet. And by streamlining its workforce and reducing costs, the company may be better positioned to weather the challenging market conditions. Circle has characterized the recent layoffs as a marginal reduction in headcount, which is part of a broader effort to reduce operational expenses and discontinue investments in non-core activities. According to the Reuters report, a Circle spokesperson said that: Circle is redoubling its focus on core business activities and execution. It has identified new areas for investment and is continuing to hire in key areas of focus on a global basis. Circle Had Expressed Plans To Expand The Workforce Earlier The recent news of Circle&#8217;s workforce reduction comes as a surprise, given that the company&#8217;s finance chief, Jeremy Fox-Green, had announced earlier this year that the USD Coin issuer had other plans. Fox-Geen mentioned that Circle had plans to increase this headcount by 15% to 25% by the end of the year, which would have added to its 900-employee workforce. Despite the recent workforce reduction, Circle has indicated that it is still actively recruiting for &#8220;key areas of focus.&#8221; Related Reading: Celsius Takes Legal Action Against StakeHound For Withholding $150 Million Fox-Green said that the company is &#8220;growing and investing and we are fortunate to be in a financial position to be able to sustain our investments.&#8221; Circle&#8217;s decision to expand its workforce by up to 25% this year represented a slower growth rate compared to 2022 when the company had doubled its headcount from the previous year. In other news, Circle had recently announced its new chief legal officer, Heath Tarbert, who previously served as the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission(CFTC). According to Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire, the company aims to bridge the gap between traditional finance and Web3, and Tarbert&#8217;s experience and legal expertise will be instrumental in advancing the utility value of the USDC stablecoin worldwide. On the developmental front, Circle made significant progress last week when CEO Jeremy Allaire announced that the company had launched its programmable wallets into production beta, marking a major milestone in the rollout of Circle&#8217;s Web3 services. The programmable wallets are designed to enable developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum blockchain. In the past few months, a number of high-profile companies in the cryptocurrency industry have announced workforce reductions. Among them are well-known firms such as Blockchain.com, Coinbase, Genesis, Huobi, and SuperRare, to name a few. Around one month ago, Binance carried out employee layoffs as part of its efforts to assess whether it has the appropriate talent to navigate the cryptocurrency market.

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows the Bitcoin &#8220;Market Value to Realized Value&#8221; (MVRV) is at a critical level currently. Will a bullish breakout take place? Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Is Retesting The 1.5 Level Right Now As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC MVRV ratio has been around a critical level recently. The &#8220;MVRV ratio&#8221; is an indicator that measures the ratio between the market cap of Bitcoin and its realized cap. The &#8220;realized cap&#8221; here refers to a capitalization model for the asset that assumes that the true value of each coin in the circulating supply is not the current spot price, but the price at which the coin was last transferred on the blockchain. This model aims to find a sort of &#8220;real value&#8221; for the coin, so its comparison with the market cap in the MVRV ratio can tell us how the current spot price (that is, the market cap) weighs up against this fair value. When the indicator has a value greater than one, it means that the market cap is more than the realized cap right now. In this situation, the investors are holding more value than they put in, so they become more likely to sell and harvest these profits. Thus, this kind of trend can suggest the asset is becoming overpriced and a correction may be on the horizon. On the other hand, low values imply the market cap of the cryptocurrency may be undervalued at the moment as the average investor is holding their coins at a loss. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin MVRV ratio over the last few years: Looks like the value of the metric has gone up recently &#124; Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin MVRV ratio had been below the one mark back during most of the second half of 2022. This isn&#8217;t an unusual trend, as bearish periods normally see investors going into deep losses, which naturally results in the indicator&#8217;s value plunging. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stuck In Tight Range: Will BTC Decompress With A Big Move? What&#8217;s interesting, though, is the metric&#8217;s interaction with the line where its value becomes 1. While bearish trends last, the level usually provides resistance to the asset. Examples of this happening during the past year&#8217;s bear market can be seen in the chart. With the rally this year, however, Bitcoin was able to break past this level, implying that a transition toward a bullish regime had occurred. The indicator briefly dropped to this level in March, but the line provided support to it, confirming that a bullish trend was indeed active. The MVRV ratio has now recently surged towards the 1.5 level, at which the market cap is 50% more than the realized cap. At these values, the asset naturally starts becoming overpriced and the risk of corrections goes up. From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the coin found resistance at this 1.5 level when it was retested back in April. Since surging back toward it recently, the cryptocurrency has been moving sideways around this level so far. Related Reading: Polygon Volume Registers Sharp Increase, What Does It Mean? It now remains to be seen whether the Bitcoin MVRV ratio can break through this level with the current retest, or if it will end up facing another rejection. Naturally, if it&#8217;s the former, the rally might be able to continue. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $30,500, down 2% in the last week.

					<description><![CDATA[Following the bearish wave which has swept across the crypto market today, the KAVA token has experienced a significant fall in its market price. According to data from CoinMarketCap, KAVA is currently down by 10.90%, representing the biggest loss of the day. In general, the total crypto market cap is down by 0.31%, with the market leader, Bitcoin (BTC), losing by 0.46% in the last 24 hours. This is while prominent tokens, such as Ripple (XRP), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Solana (SOL), have managed to stay afloat, recording no significant gain or loss. KAVA Price Action And Analysis KAVA began the week with sideways movement hovering around that $0.94 price region. However, after a slight price dip which saw the token retest at $0.91 on July 10, it embarked on a bullish run reaching as high as $1.02 the next day.

Following a consolidation at this zone for some hours, the token experienced a significant price boost yesterday,  hitting a top price of $1.06. Albeit, since attaining this price level, KAVA has been on a downward trend returning to the price levels seen at the start of the week.  Analyzing its 4-Hour chart, KAVA is currently in a strong consolidation zone, but if the bulls assume control of the market, the token could rise to the $1.06 price region, which has previously served as a strong resistance level. A sustained bullish momentum that results in the altcoin pushing past this level could lead to a market price in the region of  $1.22. That said, if the current selling pressure remains strong, KAVA could drop from its consolidation zone, falling as low as $0.73. Based on CoinMarketCap data, KAVA is currently trading at $0.94, with a 0.16% gain in the last hour. Meanwhile, the token’s daily volume is down by 16.64% and now stands at $48 million. KAVA ranks as the 70th biggest cryptocurrency with a market cap value of $588 million.  KAVA Trading At $0.94 On The 4-Hour Chart &#124; Source: KAVAUSD Chart On Tradingview.com KAVA Records Some Positive Moves Despite Price Movement  Contrary to its negative price movement today, Kava has actually recorded some positive news in the last few days. Just yesterday,  its blockchain network launched the Kava 14 mainnet upgrade, which in part likely caused the price hike seen yesterday. As expected, this latest upgrade introduces a lot of new features, most notably smooth and seamless asset conversion between the Cosmos and Ethereum ecosystems.

					<description><![CDATA[In a jaw-dropping discovery that has sent shockwaves through the Shiba Inu community, a dormant whale has emerged from hibernation. This anonymous early investor, who holds a staggering 10.15% of the total SHIB supply, has recently made significant moves, causing speculation within the community. The whale, identified by his address &#8220;0x140&#8221;, has been dormant for a staggering 157 days, but has now reawakened with a series of unprecedented transactions. In a span of just 24 hours, the whale distributed a whopping 4 trillion SHIB tokens, equivalent to a staggering $30 million, across nine new wallets. Detailed data from Etherscan confirms the veracity of the whale&#8217;s recent movement. The whale distributed precisely 4,000,000,000,107 SHIB tokens across nine new wallets within a 24-hour period. The transfers began with a small amount of 107 SHIB to a specific address, followed by subsequent transfers of 500,000,000,000 SHIB each to eight separate addresses. Shiba Inu Whale Provides A Shock This unexpected flurry of activity has captured the attention of analysts and on-chain experts. Lookonchain, a prominent crypto analytics expert, noted that this whale is likely the largest holder of SHIB, with a current holding of 101.47 trillion SHIB tokens, worth an astonishing $756 million. Furthermore, this early investor has a total of 23 wallets where the SHIB holdings are distributed. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Market Cap Climbs By $500 Million – Is A Price Rally On The Horizon? This colossal whale&#8217;s involvement in the SHIB ecosystem dates back to its early days. Spot On Chain, an on-chain analyst, revealed that the whale initially acquired a staggering 103.33T SHIB with a mere 38 ETH ($14,000) during its inception. Riding the wave of SHIB&#8217;s meteoric rise, this investment once reached a staggering valuation of $8.16 billion. In 2021, during the infamous SHIB price pump, the whale made strategic moves, reaping significant profits. Spot On Chain revealed that the whale exchanged approximately 1.9 trillion SHIB across various platforms, including Binance, Coinbase, and MEXC, at an average price of $0.00000969 in July 2021. This savvy maneuver resulted in an estimated profit of $18.49 million. Notably, the whale also executed a substantial sale of 603 billion SHIB tokens for 2,411 ETH, equivalent to $9.6 million at the time. Additionally, the whale deposited a staggering 1.25 trillion SHIB, worth $8.77 million, into Coinbase during the same year. SHIB Breakout Not Confirmed Yet The recent flurry of activity by this influential whale has left the SHIB community speculating about the intentions behind these transactions. With the distribution of such a massive amount of SHIB tokens, there are growing concerns and uncertainties among SHIB proponents. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Ecosystem Token BONE Surges 88%, Too Late To Buy? As the market keeps a keen eye on this whale&#8217;s next moves, it is evident that the impact of this early investor cannot be underestimated. Holding 10% of the total SHIB supply, this whale wields significant influence over the market and has the potential to trigger substantial fluctuations in SHIB&#8217;s price. At press time, the SHIB price stood at $0.00000752. The breakout from the downward trend (yellow circle) that has been in place since the beginning of February has thus still not been confirmed. Also, the longer the price does not make a decisive move towards the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.0000083, the more likely it becomes that the SHIB price will remain in bearish territory.

<h2>Shiba Inu Whale Provides A Shock</h2>
<p>This unexpected flurry of activity has captured the attention of analysts and on-chain experts. Lookonchain, a prominent crypto analytics expert, <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1679344006734700544" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">noted</a> that this whale is likely the largest holder of SHIB, with a current holding of 101.47 trillion SHIB tokens, worth an astonishing $756 million. Furthermore, this early investor has a total of 23 wallets where the SHIB holdings are distributed.</p>

<p>This colossal whale&#8217;s involvement in the SHIB ecosystem dates back to its early days. Spot On Chain, an on-chain analyst, <a href="https://twitter.com/spotonchain/status/1679312411344633856" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">revealed</a> that the whale initially acquired a staggering 103.33T SHIB with a mere 38 ETH ($14,000) during its inception. Riding the wave of SHIB&#8217;s meteoric rise, this investment once reached a staggering valuation of $8.16 billion.</p>
<p>In 2021, during the infamous SHIB price pump, the whale made strategic moves, reaping significant profits. Spot On Chain revealed that the whale exchanged approximately 1.9 trillion SHIB across various platforms, including Binance, Coinbase, and MEXC, at an average price of $0.00000969 in July 2021. This savvy maneuver resulted in an estimated profit of $18.49 million.</p>
<p>Notably, the whale also executed a substantial sale of 603 billion SHIB tokens for 2,411 ETH, equivalent to $9.6 million at the time. Additionally, the whale deposited a staggering 1.25 trillion SHIB, worth $8.77 million, into Coinbase during the same year.</p>
<h2>SHIB Breakout Not Confirmed Yet</h2>
<p>The recent flurry of activity by this influential whale has left the SHIB community speculating about the intentions behind these transactions. With the distribution of such a massive amount of SHIB tokens, there are growing concerns and uncertainties among SHIB proponents.</p>

<p>As the market keeps a keen eye on this whale&#8217;s next moves, it is evident that the impact of this early investor cannot be underestimated. Holding 10% of the total SHIB supply, this whale wields significant influence over the market and has the potential to trigger substantial fluctuations in SHIB&#8217;s price.</p>
<p>At press time, the SHIB price stood at $0.00000752. The breakout from the downward trend (yellow circle) that has been in place since the beginning of February has thus still not been confirmed. Also, the longer the price does not make a decisive move towards the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.0000083, the more likely it becomes that the SHIB price will remain in bearish territory.</p>
