<p>Binance chief executive officer Changpeng Zhao, aka CZ, has taken to Twitter to refute the accuracy of his fortune, as reported by <em>Bloomberg</em>. CZ indicated that the numbers are wrong, and his net worth is nowhere near the figure reported by the mainstream media.</p>



<p>Although Binance does not disclose its annual revenues and CZ’s stake in the exchange, Bloomberg estimated that Zhao is worth $28.2 billion and ranked him 3rd in the top 25 finance billionaires worldwide.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-rich-is-cz"><strong>How Rich Is CZ?</strong></h2>



<p>Binance&#8217;s CEO claims to be worth way less than what Bloomberg estimated.</p>



<p>In an April 27 <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1651467819400278016">tweet</a>, CZ pointed out that Bloomberg’s latest finance-rich list had inaccurate data about his crypto fortune. Per the publication’s list, the Binance boss’s net worth stands at a whopping $28.2 billion, ranking him the third richest finance billionaire in the world. Bloomberg also estimated Binance’s annual revenue at around $12 billion.</p>



<p>“Numbers all wrong. I don&#8217;t have anywhere near as much. Don&#8217;t know why they do this,” Zhao tweeted. The crypto billionaire also wrote “4”, suggesting his net worth should be somewhere around Dan Gilbert’s $19.4 billion and Uday Kotak’s $13 billion.</p>



<p>In a follow-up tweet, CZ said he is a “small potato in a small (but growing) industry” when a Twitter user suggested the Binance founder is richer than Elon Musk and Vladimir Putin.</p>



<p>Well-known within the cryptosphere, Zhao began receiving more news coverage last November during the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried-led exchange FTX. Contrary to popular belief, CZ clarified in his latest tweet that he had never viewed the now-defunct FTX as a rival. “We welcome more (well-run) exchanges in the space,” he added.</p>



<p>Following the implosion of FTX, Zhao has become one the most prominent names left standing in the crypto world, and Binance’s business now considerably surpasses every other digital asset exchange by huge margins.</p>



<p>This is not the first time Zhao is spotlighting reporting inaccuracies by mainstream media. The CEO has previously described articles published by Forbes or Bloomberg as FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt).</p>



<p>Binance and CZ are currently facing a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-ether-slump-as-cftc-sues-binance-and-cz-over-willful-violation-of-u-s-laws/">lawsuit </a>from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on allegations of violating derivatives laws and helping users conceal their locations to evade trading restrictions.</p>

<ul>
<li>The bridging solution is enhanced with fast finality and improved user experience.</li>



<li>Polygon zkEVM mainnet beta went live in March as an open-source, permissionless, and public platform.</li>
</ul>



<p>Polygon, the Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, has integrated a PoS bridge to its zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM), according to an April 26 statement.</p>



<p>Polygon Bridge for zkEVM has almost the same user experience as that of Polygon PoS but with some enhancements, including a visible progress bar, a transaction panel with colour-coded completion status, a time estimate for pending transactions, and a filter.</p>



<p>Also important to note is the improved finality of the zkEVM Polygon Bridge, reportedly allowing users to claim funds on the Ethereum mainnet in between 30-60 seconds. Per the developers, bridges using zero-knowledge technology are better than competing technologies because they are based entirely on smart contracts. Additionally, no mapping is required.</p>



<p><em>‘‘Once a user triggers the bridging transaction, the token being bridged will automatically be mapped. This is a major UX improvement compared to other chains, which require users to map tokens before bridging – a process that can take hours or even days,’’ Polygon <a href="https://polygon.technology/blog/announcing-polygon-bridge-for-polygon-zkevm-2?utm_source=zkevm-bridge-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog">wrote</a>. </em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-zkevm-enhancing-polygon-s-scalability-of-ethereum"><strong>zkEVM enhancing Polygon’s scalability of Ethereum</strong></h2>



<p>Polygon had its zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) mainnet beta <a href="https://zycrypto.com/polygons-zkevm-mainnet-beta-goes-live-unlocking-limitless-possibilities-for-ethereum-compatible-dapps/">launch</a> last month, a significant milestone in the network aimed at improving the scalability of the decentralized applications (dApps) built on Ethereum.</p>



<p>zkEVM is enabled with zero-knowledge proofs, a technology allowing data validation without revealing the data itself. Polygon developers tout the technology as key in enhancing the security and privacy of dApps cost-effectively and efficiently.</p>



<p>Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin endorsed zkEVM, becoming the first to complete a successful transaction of 0.005 ETH sent to a random address. Some of the dApps using zkEVM include Lens and Balancer. Infrastructure providers like ANKR, The Graph, and Alchemy also use the platform.</p>



<p>Polygon is also making strides in other areas around zero-knowledge technology, recently introducing a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/polygon-hits-it-big-with-new-web3-id-service-based-on-zero-knowledge-proofs/">decentralized identity solution</a> giving developers tools to create self-sovereign, decentralized, and private identity solutions based on zero-knowledge proofs.</p>

<ul>
<li>Circle launches USDC cross-chain transfer protocol across Ethereum and Avalanche, cutting off the use of third-party bridges. </li>



<li>The team behind the project says the move will ease the user experience, improve market liquidity, and aid capital efficiency.</li>



<li>The CEO of Circle expects a turnaround amid plunging market cap and regulatory concerns in the past few months.</li>
</ul>



<p>The race for interoperability among stablecoins has heightened in recent years as networks seek to make digital ecosystems less fragmented and exclusive.</p>



<p>Circle, the company behind the USD Coin (USDC), has released a mainnet protocol that allows users to transfer USDC between Avalanche and Ethereum networks seamlessly. The Cross Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) will work without third-party bridges meaning that users will no longer be required to deposit their assets with a Circle partner to transfer assets between networks.</p>



<p>According to the team, unlike traditional bridges, this transfer protocol burns all tokens and issues new ones on the receiving blockchain. Assets will not need to be stored on the sending chain before being claimed on the other network.</p>



<p>Joao Geginatto, the vice president of Circle, has expressed faith in the protocol stating that it will improve liquidity, ease user experience and help capital efficiency in DeFi.</p>



<p>“<em>With CCTP, developers can simplify the user experience, and their users can trust that they are always transacting with a highly liquid, safe, and fungible asset in native USDC.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>According to Circle, several top cross-chain protocols, like MetaMask, Cela, LayerZero, Wormhole, etc, have pledged to integrate the new transfer protocol.</p>



<p>The CCTP solves the fragmentation and exclusive problems attributed to most chains. Furthermore, the issues linked with unofficial versions of USDC in several networks due to bridge issues will gradually become history with the CCTP as the official way of transferring the asset.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-innovation-is-the-only-way-out">Innovation is the only way out</h2>



<p>With developers churning out new upgrades and features, USDC has a chance to reclaim its over $50 billion market cap. USDC has been in the waters for months due to technical and regulatory issues. In March, the stablecoin lost its <a href="https://zycrypto.com/usdc-stablecoin-loses-dollar-peg-following-collapse-of-major-banking-partner/">peg</a> after the revelation that it had $3.3 billion Silicon Valley Bank in the wake of the bank’s saga.</p>



<p>To compound the stablecoin woes, it has consistently lost market share to its rival Tether in Q1 2023. Amidst the uptick in the digital asset market in the past three months leading to a market cap of $1.2 trillion, USDC recorded losses of 26.9% while Terra gained 20.9%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recently, Circle’s CEO Jeremy Allaire blamed the dwindling market share of USDC on the current state of crypto regulation in the US as the SEC crackdown continues.</p>

<p>Lawyers of Voyager Digital were taken aback when Binance.US called off its deal to acquire the assets of the insolvent crypto lender on Tuesday. The deal had been approved by a judge last week in the bankruptcy court.</p>



<p>Voyager will now have to distribute cash and crypto to customers using its platform following Binance.US’s about-face.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-surprised"><strong>“Surprised”</strong></h2>



<p>Voyager attorneys were “surprised” Binance.US <a href="https://twitter.com/investvoyager/status/1650921887512272917">terminated </a>its asset buy deal.</p>



<p>In a bankruptcy court in the Southern District Court of New York on Wednesday, the lawyers posited that the exchange was still displaying interest as recently as last week.</p>



<p>“The debtors have been in constant contact and communication with Binance.US, and as lately as this past Friday, Binance.US had expressed the desire to close the transaction as soon as possible,” Christine Okike of law firm Kirkland &amp; Ellis, representing Voyager, stated.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why Binance.US Nuked Voyager Deal</strong></h2>



<p>Binance backed out of its deal to acquire Voyager’s assets due to what it described as a “hostile and uncertain regulatory climate in the United States.” Following the termination of the deal, recoveries for Voyager’s creditors will likely be in the range of 40% to 65%, Okike noted. This depends on whether Voyager wins a parallel suit involving now-defunct digital asset exchange FTX and how much recovery FTX offers its creditors.</p>



<p>Voyager was among multiple crypto companies to go under last year after the abrupt fall of Terra’s LUNA governance token and the UST algorithmic stablecoin. The crypto broker declared bankruptcy on July 5.</p>



<p>A number of regulators sought to block the deal, which would have allowed Voyager customers to become Binance.US customers. That included the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Federal Trade Commission, the Texas State Securities Board, and the Texas Department of Banking.</p>



<p>Binance.US’s withdrawal comes after its international affiliate found itself in the cross-hairs of regulators in the United States. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-ether-slump-as-cftc-sues-binance-and-cz-over-willful-violation-of-u-s-laws/">launched </a>a lawsuit against Binance last month, accusing the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume of violating derivatives rules. In fact, some <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1650941963955236887">speculated </a>that Binance.US’s decision to pull out of the Voyager agreement could be part of the conditions of a forthcoming settlement with the CFTC.</p>

<p>The Bahamas is gearing up to tighten its crypto regulations in a bid to protect investors after FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire — largely based in the nation— was swiftly wiped out last November.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stiffer-crypto-regulation-incoming-following-ftx-collapse"><strong>Stiffer Crypto Regulation Incoming Following FTX Collapse</strong></h2>



<p>Months after the implosion of FTX put the Bahamas on the spot, the Caribbean nation is preparing to impose more stringent regulations on crypto assets, as per an April 25 <a href="https://www.scb.gov.bs/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/SCB-Opens-Consultation-Period-for-DARE-Bill-2023-PR.pdf">statement </a>from the Securities Commission of the Bahamas (SCB).</p>



<p>The laws, packaged in the Digital Assets and Registered Exchanges (DARE) bill, including expanding the definition of digital assets businesses, measures on stablecoins, proof-of-work mining, as well as covering crypto services such as advice, derivatives, and crypto staking.</p>



<p>Under the new rulebook, “operators of a digital asset exchange must ensure the systems and controls used in its activities are adequate and appropriate for the scale and nature of its business.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Bahamas, which passed crypto laws previously dubbed the Digital Assets and Registered Exchanges Act in 2020, was home to Bankman-Fried and his once multi-billion-dollar digital asset exchange FTX, which went under last year. FTX’s new CEO John Ray III has since accused the Bahamian government of directing unauthorized access to the exchange to obtain digital assets that should be under the control of FTX. </p>



<p>Moreover, Bankman-Fried was also accused of using corporate funds to purchase luxury penthouses in the island nation. The disgraced CEO has pleaded not guilty to charges brought against him for his role in the astonishing FTX collapse, and his criminal trial is set to take place in October.</p>



<p>Ms. Christina Rolle, Executive Director of the Securities Commission of The Bahamas, noted that once passed, the proposed DARE legislation would become “among the most advanced pieces of digital asset legislation in the world and will align with The Bahamas’ commitment to facilitating development and innovation in a well-regulated environment.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bahamas Prohibits Algorithmic Stablecoins</strong></h2>



<p>In order to prevent another crypto disaster, the Bahamas&#8217; regulator is also banning the issuance of algorithmic stablecoins in response to last May’s collapse of TerraUSD.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you can recall, the blowup of the Terra ecosystem, which stemmed from the depegging of UST from the U.S. dollar, ignited a deep downturn that obliterated investors’ funds and also undermined the reputation of the entire cryptocurrency sector. It also triggered a domino effect that saw many other prominent crypto-focused firms experiencing liquidity problems or filing for bankruptcy protection.</p>



<p>Specifically, the upcoming regulation will introduce “a new and comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins” whose value is tied to the United States dollar or another stable asset.</p>



<p>Public consultation for the new bill will run until May 31, and the regulator hopes it will become law by the end of the second quarter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bitcoin, which has steadily climbed about 70% since the start of 2023, was trading hands at a price of $29,728.28 at press time.</p>

<p>A class action lawsuit brought against Ripple four years ago by investors who claim that XRP is a security is set to continue.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, Crypto Law, a regulatory news website for digital assets, provided the update noting that a hearing on the case will take place on April 26 in a California federal court where parties in the Zakinov v. Ripple lawsuit will be heard.</p>



<p>The website further noted that only 500 members of the public should be allowed online access to the proceedings. As per the announcement, “the hearing is for oral arguments on the question of certifying the class of XRP holders suing Ripple.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Background to the Lawsuit</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-suffers-a-serious-blow-as-court-denies-ripples-motion-to-dismiss-securities-lawsuit/">The lawsuit</a> was brought against Ripple and Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, by the plaintiff in 2019, Vladi Zakinov, and two other individuals through investor Bradley Sostack, the lead plaintiff in the consolidated lawsuit.</p>



<p>As per the plaint, Vladi Zakinov sued the defendants claiming that XRP is an unregistered security, after suffering a considerable loss from the sale of XRP in January 2018. The plaintiff also sought to ratify the case into a class action lawsuit that generally included all persons or entities who purchased XRP. However, the defendants maintained that XRP is not a security asking the court to dismiss the claim. </p>



<p>As per the announcement by Crypto Law, today’s hearing will be for oral arguments on the question of certifying the class of XRP holders suing Ripple.</p>



<p><em>“The plaintiff, Bradley Sostak, who owned XRP for two weeks, is asking to be lead plaintiff in the class and is asking to represent all XRP holders who either owned it and sold it at a loss or own it today,”</em> Crypto Law wrote.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, John Deaton, who had previously filed an amicus brief on behalf of 75K+ XRP holders in the case, commented that he intends to follow the proceedings, although his motion is yet to be ruled on.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ripple-s-battle-with-the-sec"><strong>Ripple’s Battle With The SEC</strong></h2>



<p>That said, as Ripple battles out the case, the community is still focused on what will come from the firm’s parallel battle <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-lawsuit-has-the-sec-failed-to-legally-prove-that-xrp-is-a-security-this-web3-lawyer-thinks-so/">with the SEC</a>. With most of the briefs finalized now, it is expected that Judge Analisa Torres could deliver a summary judgement soon.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the ongoing legal battles have increased dilemmas among investors torn between selling their holdings or waiting for the ruling. Nonetheless, with SEC’s apparent onslaught on the crypto sector despite the lack of sufficient regulations, most observers believe Ripple could bag a win, helping XRP to break new ground.</p>



<p>At press time, XRP was trading at $0.47, up 3.26% in the past 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap data.</p>

<p>Solana, one of the largest Proof-of-Stake networks in the world, has made a major entry into the world of artificial intelligence (AI) with the launch of an open-source reference implementation for a ChatGPT plugin.</p>



<p>Announcing the move Tuesday, Solana Labs noted that the new plugin would let users interact with the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/solana-smartphone-set-for-early-may-sales-here-are-its-exciting-features/">Solana</a> network directly from ChatGPT.</p>



<p>Chat GPT is a large language model developed by OpenAI, a company that was co-founded by billionaire Elon Musk in 2015. Since its launch last November, ChatGPT has quickly garnered global popularity due to its AI-powered chatbot, which generates sophisticated responses to just about any prompt. From passing tough exams in various fields such as business, medicine and law, many now see ChatGPT as revolutionizing work.</p>



<p>To this end, various industries have started to leverage this technology, including players in the crypto sector who seek to enhance user experience and make their products more accessible.</p>



<p>The new ChatGPT plugin allows developers to build AI-powered applications on top of the Solana network, opening up a wide range of possibilities for businesses and individuals alike. It is also important to note that the new reference implementation is fully open-source, meaning anyone can use it to build their applications.</p>



<p>Solana Labs further noted that once ChatGPT plugins are available, users will be able “to check wallet balance, transfer tokens, and purchase NFTs,” sharing a screenshot on what to expect.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="817" height="978" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-11.png" alt="" class="wp-image-80188" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-11.png 817w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-11-251x300.png 251w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-11-768x919.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 817px) 100vw, 817px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1m-grant-from-ai-developers"><strong>$1M Grant from AI Developers</strong></h2>



<p>Meanwhile, earlier today, the Solana Foundation announced that it would be allocating grants to ecosystem teams building AI tools atop Solana. According to the non-profit, such individuals or teams can seek a grant from a $1M fund which aims to give each project from $5,0000 to $25,000.</p>



<p><em>“Solana&#8217;s high throughput and scalability provide a unique opportunity to build brand new ideas with AI. These grants are meant to encourage the Solana ecosystem to explore new use cases of these novel technologies,”</em> the foundation tweeted.</p>



<p>That said, Solana (SOL) has been <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-predicts-why-solana-could-bounce-back-even-better/">on a tear</a>, soaring over 8% in the past 24 hours to trade at $22 at press time as investors met the announcement with great enthusiasm. Despite suffering incessant network outages, Tuesday’s announcement represents a significant milestone for Solana, considering AI can enhance user experience and improve the network&#8217;s overall health.</p>

<p>On April 24, 2023, the European Central Bank (ECB) published the findings of focus groups and in-depth interviews in all euro area countries from December 2022 to January 2023. The study aimed at soliciting views on the features of a potential digital wallet targeted a cross-section of participants ranging from the general population, the tech-savvy, merchants, and the underbanked.</p>



<p>According to the study, the underbanked category was the only target group uncomfortable with adopting a new digital payment solution. Awareness and knowledge of digital wallets within the underbanked groups were generally low. The focus groups also found that the underbanked had general mistrust of the banking system. The underbanked also carried out most transactions using cash.</p>



<p>As per the ECB study, the underbanked were defined as participants who may hold a bank account but rarely use banking services or other payment apps and direct debits. The underbanked were low-income earners who considered a bank account an unnecessary additional cost. The underbanked who had a smartphone used them mostly for making and receiving calls, using social apps, and playing games.</p>



<p>The focus groups found that the underbanked did not have worthwhile reasons to learn how to use digital banking services for fear that their knowledge would soon be obsolete. The underbanked acknowledged society’s gradual shift from cash and recognized they would have to deal with digital payments at some point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some underbanked imagined having a digital wallet but would not use it for large sums of money to limit their losses in case of any problems. The study found that younger respondents were more willing than older respondents to adopt the digital wallet.</p>



<p>On April 20, 2023, the European Union (EU) Parliament approved the first rules to trace crypto-asset transfers, prevent money laundering, and common supervision and customer protection rules. The <em>“travel rule already used in traditional finance will require information on crypto asset transfers to be stored on both sides of the transfer.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Markets in Crypto Assets regulation (MiCA) is the EU’s proposed regulatory scheme that aims to cover issuers of crypto assets, crypto asset service providers (CASPs) and to protect crypto asset holders.</p>



<p>Crypto proponents have argued that Decentralized Finance (DeFi) can enable the underbanked and the unbanked to access opportunities and products not traditionally available to them via traditional finance.</p>



<p>Although proponents have argued that cryptocurrencies have the potential to provide easy access to financial services to the underbanked, opponents of cryptocurrency believe that there are other ways to address financial inclusion rather than through cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>The global NFT market has seen a significant downturn recently, with various platforms and investors feeling the impact. As the hype surrounding NFTs subsided last year, the market experienced a correction, leading to a decline in trading volumes and valuations.</p>



<p>OpenSea, one of the largest NFT marketplaces, has been hit particularly hard, with its valuation now facing a significant cut by one of its most prominent investors, Tiger Global. According to a recent report by The Information, Tiger Global, a $13 billion tech-focused venture fund, recently disclosed that its equity in OpenSea has dropped from $126.8 million to $30.2 million, representing a 76% drawdown. The firm became one of the largest investors in OpenSea when the NFT platform raised $300 million during a Series C round earlier last year. </p>



<p>Last December, the firm reported a 20% paper loss, with over half of that drawdown coming from its crypto-related investments. The New York-based firm established its venture fund in 2021 before placing sizeable bets on blue-chip crypto startups. Some other notable firms that the firm had reportedly dabbled in include Bored Ape Yacht Club creator Yuga Labs, MoonPay, and FTX, which went under last November, completely wiping out the firm’s investment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>NFTs Tank Alongside Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>



<p>Despite the number of NFT projects growing to record highs in the past year, the overall income of the industry has been dwindling as crypto prices dump. In the past year or so, most cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ether, have dipped by over 70%, a scenario that could have triggered a loss of interest in NTFs.</p>



<p>In its recent report, Tiger Global valued OpenSea at just $3Billion, despite the popular NFT marketplace hitting a $13.3 billion valuation at the height of NFT mania last year. This value drop has been largely attributed to the drop in NFT sales plummet and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/blur-vs-opensea-battle-for-nft-marketplace-supremacy-rages-on/">increased competition</a> from rival platforms like Blur.</p>



<p>But OpenSea is not the only casualty of the NFT market downturn. Other platforms, including Rarible, have also seen a decline in trading volumes and valuations. Meanwhile, high-profile NFT sales have slowed, with many artists and collectors holding back as the market cools off.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-there-is-still-hope"><strong>There Is Still Hope</strong></h2>



<p>That said, despite the downturn, there are still reasons to be optimistic about the future of NFTs. According to a recent report by DAPP Radar, despite a disappointing end to the year 2022, NFTs had a strong Q1 2023, with a 137.04% increase in trading volume to $4.7 billion, the highest since Q2 2022.</p>



<p>This renewed growth has been fuelled by the launch of new marketplaces and protocols such as NFTFi, which seek to bridge the gap between DeFi and NFT ecosystems by introducing various approaches to unlock liquidity for NFTs.</p>

<p>Hidden in all versions of the Apple MacOS since 2018, a copy of the original Bitcoin white paper penned by the pseudonymous founder Satoshi Nakamoto will not be part of the next update, Apple-focused news publication <em>9to5Mac </em>has <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/04/25/apple-removes-bitcoin-whitepaper-from-macos/">reported</a>.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shockingly-bitcoin-whitepaper-has-been-hidden-inside-mac-computers-for-years/"><em>ZyCrypto </em></a>reported about three weeks ago, a post from prominent technologist Andy Baio revealed that a PDF copy of Satoshi’s Bitcoin white paper had been shipped in every version of MacOS from Mojave to Ventura.</p>



<p><em>“Of all the documents in the world, why was the Bitcoin whitepaper chosen? Is there a secret Bitcoin maxi working at Apple?&#8221; Baio asked on his blog Waxy. &#8220;Maybe it was just a convenient, lightweight multipage PDF for testing purposes, never meant to be seen by end users.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>The document was hidden within Virtual Scanner II, which was not enabled by default. The file went unnoticed by the tech giant’s millions of users and was believed to be a joke among Apple engineers or even included as a subtle endorsement of Bitcoin and the underlying blockchain technology. It even prompted self-proclaimed (and much-contested) Satoshi Nakamoto Craig Wright, who has long attempted to copyright the Bitcoin white paper and has been suing places that host it, to <a href="https://twitter.com/Dr_CSWright/status/1643882093875740673">suggest </a>that Apple was breaching his copyright.</p>



<p>However, Apple has now removed the document from the latest version of the Mac operating system. A look at the Beta Software Program, upcoming version 13.4 of MacOS Ventura, shows it does not contain the entire Virtual Scanner 11 tool, which may have been included in the system for testing purposes. The white paper was located in hidden system files and was not intended to be discovered by everyday users.</p>



<p><em>“This pretty much confirms our original theory that both the Bitcoin white paper and the internal tool were never meant to be found by regular users,” 9to5Mac observed.</em></p>



<p>Alongside Satoshi’s white paper was a nondescript image of a sign at Treasure Island in San Francisco.</p>



<p>The enigma surrounding the inclusion and subsequent scrapping of the Bitcoin white paper from macOS remains unanswered. With Apple remaining mum on the subject, the crypto community is left to weigh the implications and the stance of the world’s largest tech company.</p>

<ul>
<li>BTC has surged over 8% in the past 24 hours following the news of First Republic Bank’s share slump. </li>



<li>The price gain was recorded across the board as the top 25 digital assets by market capitalization bounced positively with BTC.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Technical indicators show that BTC may continue to rally after gradually breaking the correlation from the S&amp;P 500.</li>
</ul>



<p>Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have hit new highs in April, not recorded in recent months, with bulls keeping up the pressure in the light of the recent traditional financial institution’s debacle.</p>



<p>The price of BTC has moved in an upward trajectory after the news of more woes at First Republic Bank. BTC is up by 8.88% over the last 24 hours, breaking past $28,500 and exchanging hands at $29,839 at press time.</p>



<p>Jake Boyle, a director at crypto brokerage Caleb &amp; Brown, gave his opinion on the issue, highlighting that banking failures led to a new positive outlook.</p>



<p>“<em>With First Republic Bank looking like it could go under, I suspect the market is anticipating yet more liquidity injections to prop up what certainly seems to be an American banking sector that is still very much in the throes of crisis,&#8221; </em>he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The price rally <a href="https://twitter.com/matt_willemsen/status/1650969375707365376?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">sparked </a>off hours after Fox Business Reporter broke the news that bankers working with the institution expect it to go into government receivership. A receivership is a corporate restructuring model that allows creditors to recover funds and firms to avoid bankruptcy.</p>



<p>Other assets in the top 25 also recorded slight gains, with Solana leading the pack with 9%. Leading altcoin ETH gained 7.36% after sliding below $1,900 in a recent price correction which wiped away gains from the Shanghai upgrade. Dogecoin, Polkadot, and Polygon also recorded slight gains.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bitcoins-break-away-from-stocks">Bitcoins break away from stocks</h2>



<p>For a greater part of 2022, BTC and stock prices saw a prior correlation as Feds continued to hike interest rates forcing investors to abandon risky assets. New data from crypto analytics firm Santiment suggests that the correlation between BTC and the S&amp;P 500 may take a back seat as investors begin to see Bitcoin as a haven amidst the current traditional banking woes.</p>



<p>First Republic Bank was first reported to be in crisis in March, resulting in top banking institutions, including JPMorgan depositing $30 billion in the embattled bank. Later that month, the US authorities debated creating an emergency lending facility to help with the structural changes in the bank’s balance sheet.</p>



<p>On April 23, the bank announced its Q1 earnings, showing that deposits had plunged by over $100 billion while seeking to pursue “strategic options” to salvage the situation. </p>

<p>Bitcoin has continued to come under pressure, tagging along with Ether and other cryptocurrencies amid regulatory concerns for the crypto sector and profit-taking activities.</p>



<p>At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $27,978, down 8.06% since it tapped a ten-month high of $31,000 on April 14. On the other hand, Ether was exchanging hands at $1,859, down just over 13% in the past week, with <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ethereum-dogecoin-and-cardano-mount-center-stage-this-month-heres-what-to-expect/">most altcoins</a> being hammered a little bit more.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s gradual decline has led some analysts to focus on cues to help foretell its next possible move.</p>



<p>According to Brian Q, senior market analyst at Santiment, investors should look out for Bitcoin’s utility metric even as the cryptocurrency gets torn between revisiting $30,000 or $25,000. In his view, <em>“without a rising number of coins moving from address to address, and without a rising number of addresses interacting with those rising coins, most price rallies are historically short-lived.”</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="647" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-7-1024x647.png" alt="" class="wp-image-80159" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-7-1024x647.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-7-300x190.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-7-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-7-1536x971.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-7-2048x1294.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTCUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>He further noted that bull traps often occur when prices rise quickly but utility lags, a scenario that arose in the first quarter of 2023.</p>



<p><em>“Traders become FOMO&#8217;ers and buy into the inflating market caps, and then get blindsided when the rally comes to a quick halt shortly after they bought. We can see that this occurred with the 3-month pump at the beginning of 2023,” </em>he added<em>.</em></p>



<p>On that note, Brian highlighted three more metrics traders should watch out for in determining Bitcoin’s utility. According to him, traders should closely monitor trading volume, daily active addresses, and circulation. While these metrics have not been impressive recently, he emphasised that on-chain utility conditions need to improve for the cryptocurrency’s price to recover.</p>



<p>Despite utility metrics displaying lacklustre behaviour, other vital metrics such as whale activity and the market-value-to-realized-value (MVRV) have been surging, suggesting increasing interest in Bitcoin.</p>



<p>Today, crypto analyst Hoss shared a chart by Glassnode showing that whales with more than 10,000 BTC <a href="https://zycrypto.com/data-highlights-massive-btc-accumulation-by-whales-as-extreme-fear-grips-bitcoin-price/">have been accumulating</a> rapidly while smaller addresses are selling.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the MVRV, an indicator that has historically proven excellent at detecting major tops or bottoms, has recently tapped an 11-month high. This observation was made today by Gaah, an analyst for Santiment who expressed hope for its continued rise.</p>



<p><em>“There is still room to continue the Bitcoin price recovery, causing MVRV to reach the yellow line (intermediate region &#8211; trend transition phase) around 2.10,” </em>he wrote.</p>



<p><em>“By projecting the market behaviour of the last bear market in 2018, the Bitcoin price later this year 2023 has great chances to reach $45,000 and build a bullish structure transitioning between the bear market to a new bull market,” </em>he went on, adding that <em>“the probability of new highs in 2023 is still there.”</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="1200" height="700" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Ethereum-Transitions-Into-A-Proof-of-Stake-Blockchain-After-Successful-Merge.jpg" class="attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Ethereum Transitions Into A Proof of Stake Blockchain After Successful Merge" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Ethereum-Transitions-Into-A-Proof-of-Stake-Blockchain-After-Successful-Merge.jpg 1200w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Ethereum-Transitions-Into-A-Proof-of-Stake-Blockchain-After-Successful-Merge-300x175.jpg 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Ethereum-Transitions-Into-A-Proof-of-Stake-Blockchain-After-Successful-Merge-1024x597.jpg 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Ethereum-Transitions-Into-A-Proof-of-Stake-Blockchain-After-Successful-Merge-768x448.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p><div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div>
<p>The price of Ether (ETH) has taken a significant hit in the past few days, dropping by over 13% after tapping a ten-month high of $2,137 earlier this month. Over the past 24 hours, ETH has fallen by 1.4% and was trading at $1,826 at press time, as per CoinMarketCap data.</p>



<p>Ether’s recent price action can largely be attributed to the Shanghai or <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ethereum-and-bitcoin-prices-hold-steady-post-shanghai-upgrade/">Shapella upgrade</a>, which was implemented on April 12. The event enabled withdrawals of approximately $34 billion worth of tokens locked on Ethereum’s staking contracts, marking the network’s complete transition to a fully functional proof-of-stake network.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ether-withdrawals-soar"><strong>Ether Withdrawals Soar</strong></h2>



<p>Almost two weeks after Shanghai, Ethereum’s metrics have continued to shine, with 1,668,384 ETH worth just over $3 billion being withdrawn so far, as per data by Dune Analytics. Notably, around 65% of the total ETH withdrawn so far comes from partial withdrawals, while the rest is from full withdrawals.</p>



<p>According to Tom Wan, an analyst at crypto research firm 21 Shares, most Ether withdrawals seem to be coming from centralized exchanges such as Kraken and Coinbase.</p>



<p>According to the pundit, Monday-April 24, had the most full withdrawals, with (278.2k) ETH flowing into Kraken, Coinbase, and Cream. At just over 870,000 ETH, Kraken and Coinbase account for the majority (78.3%) of the principal withdrawals.</p>



<p>However, Kraken&#8217;s leading withdrawal count can be attributed to regulatory scrutiny, which has forced it to shut down its staking services for US citizens. Since Shanghai, Kraken has received 598k $ETH ($1.1B) in both partial and full withdrawals.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Institutions Throng to ISPs</strong></h2>



<p>Meanwhile, as CEXs continue taking out their Ether, the number of coins sent to staking pools has surged gradually. In addition to the Merge, which saw Ethereum shift from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) in September 2022, the Shanghai upgrade has further sparked the interest of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/the-shanghai-upgrade-could-spark-decentralization-in-staking-as-big-guns-are-forced-to-step-back/">institutional investors</a> in the second largest cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>According to Wan, Institutional Staking Providers (ISPs) have witnessed significant inflows of ETH staked “as Shanghai has reduced the liquidity risk for investors.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Sunday, the analyst highlighted a chart showing the five leading staking service providers for institutional investors &#8211; Bitcoin Suisse, Figment, Kiln, Staked.us, and Stakefish &#8211; have collectively staked 224,000 ETH (About $410 million) in the last 30 days.</p>



<p>Furthermore, institutional investors seem also to be eyeing Ether’s attractive staking rewards even as they continue to bet on higher prices.</p>

<p>Early Bitcoin investor and industry proponent Chamath Palihapitiya, who declared about two years ago that Bitcoin had <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-has-effectively-replaced-gold-billionaire-venture-capitalist-chamath-palihapitiya-declares/">usurped gold</a> and forecasted the leading cryptocurrency would skyrocket to the $200,000 level, is now taking a more cautious approach toward crypto assets.</p>



<p>The billionaire businessman claims that the American crypto market now faces potential extinction due to increasing regulatory pressure.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-crypto-is-dead-in-america"><strong>“Crypto Is Dead In America”</strong></h2>



<p>The U.S. crypto market is in great peril.</p>



<p>This is what Warren Buffett disciple Chamath Palihapitiya suggested during a recent episode of the <em>All-In Podcast</em> alongside fellow investors Jason Calacanis, David Sacks, and David Friedberg. Palihapitiya, who is the founder and CEO of Social Capital, a California-based venture capital firm, noted that regulators in the United States have “firmly pointed their guns at crypto”. He added that this could lead to the demise of the fledgling crypto sector within the nation.</p>



<p>It will be recalled that the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, last week tied the implosion of Silvergate and Signature Bank to their bitcoin activities while testifying before a House financial services committee. “You had Gensler even blaming the banking crisis on crypto,” Palihapitiya opined.</p>



<p>The SEC has been breathing heavily down Bitcoin’s neck in recent months following the unprecedented collapse of the now-defunct digital asset exchange FTX last November, which sent shockwaves throughout Washington DC, where disgraced founder Sam Bankman-Fried had become a key political donor.</p>



<p>The SEC <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-action-against-coinbase-triggers-ballistic-reaction-from-crypto-community/">sent </a>a Wells Notice to the publicly-listed Coinbase exchange in March, basically warning the company of impending enforcement action due to potential violations of U.S. securities law. In Palihapitiya&#8217;s opinion, despite Coinbase’s efforts to play by the rules and attempts to work with regulators, it has encountered challenges in obtaining requisite licenses. By contrast, fraudulent companies like FTX have come closer to acquiring a license.</p>



<p><em>“[Crypto companies are] probably the ones that were the most threatening to the establishment, and they were the ones that, in fairness to the regulators, did push the boundaries more than any other sector of the startup economy. So now, they’re paying the price for that. The bill has come due for them,&#8221; Palihapitiya stated.</em></p>



<p>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-ceo-is-considering-relocating-company-outside-of-the-u-s-due-to-unfavorable-regulation/">hinted </a>last week that he would consider relocating the company away from the U.S. if the country does not create a clearer rulebook for the crypto market.</p>



<p>The former Facebook executive Palihapitiya was an early investor in Bitcoin (he bought a million BTC for $80 in 2010). He also speculated in 2017 that the value of Bitcoin could reach a whopping million dollars within two decades.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bitcoin is currently changing hands at around $27,681, down by 60.21% from its $69,044 historic record set in November 2021.</p>
