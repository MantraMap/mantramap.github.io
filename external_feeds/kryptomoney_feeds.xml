										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>According to a recent<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-10/binance-bnb-acknowledges-past-flaws-in-managing-busd-peg-stablecoin-reserves?utm_content=business&amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter"> Bloomberg report</a>, Binance, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange by daily trading volume, has admitted to historical concerns with the Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin. According to statistics produced by blockchain analytics firm ChainArgos and evaluated by Bloomberg, the difference between the stablecoin&#8217;s reserves and total supply surpassed $1 billion three times.<br /><br />A Binance representative described the process of maintaining a steady $1 peg as <em>&#8220;challenging,&#8221;</em> but highlighted that there have been considerable advancements in the management of the BUSD stablecoin.<br /><br />They also stated that there was no impact on user redemptions and that this issue had not affected anyone else, despite minor anomalies appearing in the data. Binance CEO <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/binance-ceo-changpeng-zhao-sues-bloomberg-unit-for-libel/">Changpeng Zhao</a> slammed the Bloomberg report as <em>&#8220;FUD&#8221;</em> in a recent tweet, ostensibly emphasizing that BNB remains in fourth place in terms of market capitalization.<br /><br />The BUSD dispute is an example that emphasizes the significance of competent asset management by stablecoin operators, particularly as some of them pioneer new horizons such as algorithmic stability methods. <br /><br />The collapse of TerraUSD last May serves as a strong lesson to stablecoin holders to remain alert. It remains to be seen how much distrust this event will instill among consumers, who rely on these issuers to provide some kind of protection in unpredictable crypto markets.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/crypto-lender-blockfi-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection/">BlockFi</a>, a bankrupt cryptocurrency lender, is attempting to reimburse its investors. In a recent bankruptcy court hearing, the firm&#8217;s lawyers claimed that BlockFi executives paid $15 million to an investor who threatened to sue the company due to its plunging share value in the summer of 2022.<br /><br />The investor, identified only as Counterparty A, had purchased equity shares as part of executive compensation packages. The shares were worth more in 2022 due to the company&#8217;s $6 billion valuation. However, there was havoc on the market with the collapse of the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-s-sbf-bows-out-following-liquidity-crunch/">FTX ecosystem</a>, resulting in the value of BlockFi shares falling.<br /><br />As per BlockFi attorney Joshua Sussberg, the investor threatened to sue, claiming that BlockFi and its officials should have been more forthcoming about the risks of contagion in such an occurrence. The accusations, however, were dropped after the settlement amount was received.<br /><br />BlockFi founder Zac Prince provided $6.144 million of the $15 million. According to Sussberg,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I think the important takeaway here is that there was no situation where insiders were pulling money off the platform on the eve of or anywhere near this bankruptcy file&#8230; So this is not the Celsius case where management extracted value on the eve of the file.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because of the company&#8217;s exposure to FTX, the value of BlockFi shares has plummeted dramatically. On July 1, 2022, the crypto exchange extended an emergency loan to the lending platform. The financing enabled FTX to purchase BlockFi for $240 million, creating a maximum value for existing shares. <br /><br />This buyout price led to the founder, Zak Prince, losing $412.82 million in stock and missing out on a $600,000 bonus payment. The failure of the loan platform also resulted in the layoff of 20% of BlockFi&#8217;s personnel. Although an employee bonus package is being prepared for court approval, Prince and other upper management will not be considered.<br /><br />The site has also requested authorization from the courts to restore frozen assets from BlockFi wallets to users.<br /><br />The loan platform declared bankruptcy in November 2022, just weeks after the FTX ecosystem collapsed. Both companies had been at odds over $435 million in Robinhood shares that BlockFi claimed as collateral for an outstanding obligation owed to it by FTX partner <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ftx-and-alameda-merge-venture-capital-operations/">Alameda Research</a>. The shares were seized by the US Department of Justice, complicating matters even further.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/matic-price-analysis-polygon-matic-briefly-spikes-16-following-robinhood-listing-heres-what-to-watch/">Polygon (MATIC)</a> briefly surpassed the key (MA 50) barrier at $0.850 on Jan. 10 as its price slightly rebounded. At the time of publication, MATIC was up 2.36% at $0.849. According to staking rewards, MATIC took the top spot for the week in net staking inflow. MATIC saw the highest net staking inflow of $127,993,510, surpassing Ethereum&#8217;s $122 million staking inflow. MATIC has also set a new record in staking, as the staking balance reaches an all-time high of 3.55 billion MATIC. MATIC&#8217;s staking metrics are currently: a nominal yield of 6.08%, an adjusted yield of 3.30%, and a staking market cap of $2.97 billion. Mastercard is launching a spotlight program for emerging musical artists built on the Polygon blockchain to help up-and-coming creators tap into the power of Web3 and blockchain technologies. Kicking off in spring 2023, the Mastercard Artist Accelerator program will provide five emerging artists‚Äîsuch as musicians, DJs, and producers‚Äîwith the tools, skills, and access they need to forge their musical paths in the digital economy.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $1.150, $1.000, $0.950<br />Support Levels: $0.800, $0.750, $0.700</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/matic-price-analysis-where-will-matic-price-go-in-wake-of-recent-market-events-polygon-teases-big-reveal/">MATIC</a> is currently soaring at $0.85, seeking to break through to the $0.90 zone. The MATIC/USD pair could be on the verge of breaking out toward the bullish zone. If the breakout occurs, a push past the $1.0 level is possible. If the upward pressure continues, bullish traders will almost certainly approach the next horizontal resistance line, which is positioned at overbought RSI levels.<br /><br />A sustained break out of the $0.80 convergence zone, on the other hand, will indicate that MATIC consolidation from the $0.70 level is not yet complete. If the $0.95 ceiling is retested first, the daily bias could shift to the positive side. A break below the $0.80 level, on the other hand, may result in a lower correction.</p>
<h4>MATIC/USD 4-Hour Chart: Ranging</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1488" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63887 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Jan-10.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Jan-10.png 1488w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Jan-10-300x139.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Jan-10-1024x473.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Jan-10-768x355.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Jan-10-750x347.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Jan-10-1140x527.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1488px) 100vw, 1488px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">MATIC/USD 4-Hour Chart</span></em></h6>
<p>The MATIC/USD intraday bias is stable, with the focus shifting from $0.85 support to $0.90 resistance. As a result, a continuous breach may imply that the $0.876 pullback was effective. The intraday bias will shift back to the upside to retest this level.<br /><br />Breaking the MATIC/USD level of $0.876 will indicate a resumption of growth from the level of $0.832. The intraday trend is strengthening once more. The long-term level of $1.0 is the next aim. A break below the minor support level of $0.80, on the other hand, could shift the expected bullish bias to neutral and result in sideways trading.</p>

<p>Tokens supporting various liquid staking protocols are experiencing a strong rise as the withdrawal deadline for unstaking Ethereum approaches.<br /><br />According to information from <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/">CoinGecko</a>, Lido Finance (LDO) and Rocket Pool (RPL), for instance, have already recorded large gains over the previous 24 hours.<br /><br />The largest liquid-staking platform on Ethereum, Lido Finance, is powered by the governance token LDO, which has grown by over 17.2% over the past day and is currently trading at over $1.88.<br /><br />Trading activity was intense for the liquid-staking derivative cryptocurrency, which increased its daily volumes across several exchanges to $276 million, a 436% increase from the day before. According to data from CoinGecko, LDO is currently the 33rd largest cryptocurrency with a market valuation of over $1.5 billion.<br /><br />LDO futures holdings totaling approximately $1.61 million were closed out over the previous day, according to <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData">Coinglass</a>. Approximately 66% of liquidations resulted from blown-out short positions.<br /><br />For LDO, last week was very rewarding. The maker of DAI, MakerDAO, has been dethroned by Lido Finance, which has overtaken it as the largest decentralized application in terms of total value locked (TVL).<br /><br />With a staggering 74.8% rise over the last seven days compared to <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-push-above-17000-gives-miners-boost/">Bitcoin&#8217;s modest 3.8%</a> gain during the same time frame, LDO is also the greatest weekly gainer.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-mining-firms-lost-about-4-billion-in-2022/">Bitcoin mining</a> stocks increased as the value of the No. 1 digital currency climbed past $17,000. Traditional markets and stocks tied to cryptocurrencies also increased.<br /><br />As of 12:30 p.m. ET, Bitfarms increased by 32%, Marathon increased by 24%, and Riot increased by 18%. According to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">CoinMarketCap</a>, Bitcoin is currently up 1.4%, trading at about $17,240.<br /><br />Approximately six miners saw increases of over 20%, and a few more had increases of over 10%. After months of constant decline, several of these companies are still trading for less than $1. Due to rising energy costs and mining difficulties, companies experienced declining profitability during 2022. At the same time, the price of Bitcoin was falling.<br /><br />Since its January 1, 2023, low of $16,496 (which was registered on January 1), Bitcoin has increased by more than 4%. The recent price increase coincides with the escalating cryptocurrency problem, which has been made worse by the recent scandal surrounding Barry Silbert&#8217;s <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/digital-currency-group-to-expand-into-bitcoin-mining-with-100m-investment/">Digital Currency Group</a>.<br /><br />Authorities in the United States are looking into key crypto companies. The investigation that could herald another black swan catastrophe for the Bitcoin market appears to be centered on DCG&#8217;s internal transfers. Authorities have not yet filed any charges against Silbert&#8217;s crypto enterprise.<br /><br />In a recent acrimonious argument, Silbert and Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss traded accusations of employing <em>&#8220;bad faith tactics&#8221;</em> to collect the $900 million debt that Genesis, a DCG subsidiary, owes to Gemini Earn clients. Although Silbert downplayed the allegations, DCG continues to be shrouded in considerable mystery.</p>

</ul>
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ethereum-eth-trading-at-this-juncture-implies-one-thing-this-is-what-on-chain-data-says/">Ethereum (ETH)</a> is currently trading marginally at $1,270 after the price slightly recovered at 2023‚Äôs start. According to blockchain data provider Glassnode, Ethereum‚Äôs 1-month realized volatility has collapsed to 39.8%. The ETH price has only been this stable on three occasions in the past: February 2017, November 2018, and July 2020. Small to medium-sized investors holding between 1 and 100 Ethereum (ETH) have reportedly been accumulating the cryptocurrency in recent years, according to Onchain analytics company Santiment. Only twice on significant occasions have these investors liquidated their ETH holdings: in March 2019 when the price crossed the $150 threshold and in 2020 when it crossed the $500 threshold. This might indicate that these investors are cashing out when they think the price is &#8220;overextended&#8221; or too high. These small to medium-sized investors have been aggressively acquiring ETH since the 2021 crash, demonstrating confidence among the retail crowd. This shows that these investors are ready to hang onto their positions despite short-term market fluctuations because they have faith in ETH&#8217;s long-term potential.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $1,700, $1,500, $1,300<br />Support Levels: $1,200, $1,000, $800</p>
<h4>ETH/USD Daily Chart: Ranging</h4>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="1488" height="773" class="alignnone wp-image-63870 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-Daily-Jan-8-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-Daily-Jan-8-1.png 1488w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-Daily-Jan-8-1-300x156.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-Daily-Jan-8-1-1024x532.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-Daily-Jan-8-1-768x399.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-Daily-Jan-8-1-750x390.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-Daily-Jan-8-1-1140x592.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1488px) 100vw, 1488px" /></p>
<h6><em><span style="color: #999999">ETH/USD Daily Chart</span></em></h6>
<p>The recent slight <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/eth-price-analysis-ethereum-7-day-exchange-outflow-volume-drops-to-lowest-in-two-years-will-this-impact-price/">ETH/USD positive</a> trend must be verified by a sustained break above the $1,300 level, as seen on the daily charts. The moving average (MA 200) might also impede expected growth to the upside. Meanwhile, a break below the daily moving average (MA 50) at $1,240 may briefly temper bullish optimism and might lead sellers to another low.<br /><br />A break above the $1,300 horizontal resistance will show a medium-term bullish bias and potentially signal the continuation of a long-term rebound from the $1,073 low. The ETH/USD pair will need to break through the $2,000 psychological level. A break of $1,000, on the other hand, will continue the long-term downward trend.</p>
<h4>ETH/USD 4-Hour Chart: Ranging</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1488" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63871 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-4-Hour-Jan-8.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-4-Hour-Jan-8.png 1488w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-4-Hour-Jan-8-300x139.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-4-Hour-Jan-8-1024x473.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-4-Hour-Jan-8-768x355.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-4-Hour-Jan-8-750x347.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-4-Hour-Jan-8-1140x527.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1488px) 100vw, 1488px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">ETH/USD 4-Hour Chart</span></em></h6>
<p>On the 4-hour chart, the general ETH/USD rally continues, reaching $1,270, with an attempt towards $1,300. Intraday bias has returned to the crucial upper areas today. A clear breakout might have a significantly bullish outcome. The next objective is to breach $1,300 before launching towards $1,500.<br /><br />On the other hand, a breach of the near-term support band at $1,200 would suggest a recent high in the case of a downturn, though the pattern might still be upwards. The uptrend move seen on the moving average can offer the ETH/USD bulls technical support. On the other hand, any descent below $1,200 could incite the bears.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/btc-price-analysis-bitcoin-finishes-2022-down-64-as-whale-addresses-dump-10-75-billion-worth-in-13-months/">Bitcoin</a>‚Äôs advance has stalled under the $17,000 mark. At the time of publication, Bitcoin was dabbling at $16,934, marginally up in the last 24 hours. In terms of realized market volatility, December saw little activity. Just 24.6% was the extreme low for Bitcoin&#8217;s 1-month volatility; lower values were only sometimes observed, most notably in November 2018, April 2019, and August 2020. The realized cap drawdown in the 2022‚Äì23 Bitcoin bear market was -18.8%, the second-largest in history, only surpassed by the pico-bottom of the 2011 bear market, according to Glassnode. Investors have endured net realized losses totaling $88 billion. On the other hand, small to medium-sized investors holding between 0.1 and 100 BTC in their wallets have generally been accumulating Bitcoin over the past few years, according to Santiment&#8217;s Balance of Addresses metric. These investors have been active buyers since BTC&#8217;s price fell below $20,000 in July last year, increasing their holdings by 9% over the last six months. Overall, it appears that these investors are usually right over the long run, but they might not always be able to foresee short-term price changes.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $20,000 $18,500, $17,500<br />Support Levels: $16,500, $15,500, $13,500</p>

The daily chart studies show receding negative momentum while the relative strength index (RSI) is in recovery mode, which weighs on the near-term structure. <br /><br />Fresh bullish pressure might take on an initial horizontal barrier at $17,500, a break of which would accelerate BTC ascent and expose key resistance at $18,385/$20,000. Diverged moving averages are on track to create a bullish cross and mark solid support, which should cap the market and keep bears in play as soon as a rebound plays out.</p>

<p>BTC/USD started a slight recovery while crossing the 4-hour moving average (MA 200) at the resistance zone of $16,900. The BTC/USD pair bounced above the (MA 50) at the $16,600 level to move into a bullish zone. The pair even broke above the $17,000 level. It traded as high as $17,017 the prior day and is currently consolidating gains. <br /><br />Immediate support is near the $16,500 level. The first major resistance is near the $17,500 level. A break above the $17,500 resistance level could start another increase. In the stated case, it could rise toward the $20,000 resistance.</p>

<p>The upgrade is anticipated to go live in March, as the developers stated in December. Some important features that many developers wanted to add to the Shanghai update are being deferred to enable token withdrawals as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Shanghai comes after the Merge update, which enabled the network to use staked currencies rather than power-hungry computers to order transactions in September. The modification was dubbed the most ambitious software upgrade ever in that it reduced Ethereum&#8217;s power consumption by roughly 99%.</p>
<p>While the price of Ether increased for several months before the Merge, it has since dropped by around 15% along with much of the rest of the cryptocurrency market due to the repercussions of the FTX exchange&#8217;s collapse in November. More individuals and institutional investors are anticipated to stake their coins in Shanghai to support the Ethereum network and generate yield.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Still Weak, Analyst PlanB Says</h2>
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-will-be-spent-more-in-next-bull-run-says-tone-vays/">BTC</a> is displaying weak indications despite starting on a route that is slowly gaining, claims PlanB. In a recent tweet, PlanB, an analyst and the creator of the Stock-to-Flow model, claimed that despite recent advances, Bitcoin is still &#8220;weak.&#8221;</p>
<p>Relative Strength Index data for bitcoin was used by PlanB to highlight his point. The monthly timeframe BTC RSI on PlanB&#8217;s chart is slightly above 40.</p>
<p>Investors have been encouraged by analysts to be patient, emphasizing that everything is a part of the price cycle. The global stockpile of negative-yielding bonds has disappeared as a result of central banks hiking interest rates at a record rate to battle inflation, which makes it less compelling to earn returns from risky alternative assets like cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics&#8217; monthly nonfarm payrolls report released on Friday, the US gained 223,000 jobs in December, which is higher than the 200,000 jobs experts had predicted. This is down from the revised 256,000 jobs added in November. In contrast to predictions that the jobless rate would remain at 3.7%, it decreased by 3.5%.</p>
<p>BTC was recently trading at around $16,964, essentially unchanged over the previous 24 hours as investors considered early 2023 economic statistics that appeared to be at odds with one other and the U.S. central bank&#8217;s continuous commitment to raising interest rates for at least the first half of 2023. Ethereum followed a similar trajectory to trade up 1.31% at $1,269.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/52152-2/">Huobi</a>, a cryptocurrency exchange based in Singapore, revealed it would lay off around 20% of its entire workforce after weeks of rumors.</p>
<p><em>‚ÄúThe planned layoff ratio is about 20%, but it is not implemented now. With the current state of the bear market, a very lean team will be maintained going forward,‚Äù</em> a Huobi spokesperson said, adding: <em>‚ÄúThe personnel optimization aims to implement the brand strategy, optimize the structure, improve efficiency and return to the top three.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>The news comes almost a week after <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1608774459124781059?s=20&amp;t=c99c55iaBDTgpAm7nskqTg">journalist Colin Wu</a> revealed on Dec. 30 that there had been layoffs at the cryptocurrency exchange. Wu reportedly claimed that Huobi has decided to <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1610615698254102529?s=20&amp;t=c99c55iaBDTgpAm7nskqTg">require</a> wage payments to be made in stablecoins rather than fiat money, prompting employee objections.<br /><br />All domestic pay will now be paid in USDT, according to a recent internal Huobi email. Employees must <em>&#8220;to register a Huobi account to receive salary,&#8221;</em> the email adds. It also implies that additional benefits, such as welfare payments, have been terminated along with year-end bonuses. <br /><br />However, the representative for Huobi indicated that the claim that bonuses and benefits have been reduced is false.<br /><br />On October 7, Huobi was purchased by the M&amp;A fund of About Capital Management. A few days later, Huobi named Justin Sun, the founder of Tron, as an advisor. There was widespread speculation that he was the real buyer behind the About Capital transaction, although Sun consistently refuted such allegations. Sun presented a strategy to make Huobi once again one of the largest exchanges in the world in late November. A key component of this ambition is the creation of a hub in the Caribbean.<br /><br />Twitter is already <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=huobi%20communication&amp;src=typeahead_click&amp;f=top">awash</a> with claims that Huobi has shut off internal feedback and contact channels, however, Huobi&#8217;s representative has refuted these claims. <br /><br />The exchange, which is starting a global development strategy, will<em> ‚Äúfully respect the legitimate demands of local employees, and continue to provide industry-competitive incentives and treatment for outstanding talent.‚Äù</em>¬†according to a representative for Huobi.</p>

<p>Bank of France Governor Fran√ßois Villeroy de Galhau wants to strengthen the country&#8217;s grip on crypto firms this year ahead of EU-wide regulation set to take effect in 2024.<br /><br />Villeroy made the following <a href="https://www.banque-france.fr/en/intervention/new-year-wishes-2023">statement</a> during a speech on Thursday:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúThe disruption seen in 2022 is nourishing one basic conviction: France should switch as soon as possible to the compulsory authorization of DASPs (digital asset service providers) rather than simply requiring their registration,‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The French financial regulator, Autorit√© des march√©s financiers (AMF), now <a href="https://www.amf-france.org/en/professionals/fintech/my-relations-amf/obtain-dasp-authorisation">offers</a> registration and optional licensing to crypto firms wanting to lawfully deliver services. The coming year may see the implementation of mandatory licensing requirements for crypto asset service providers.<br /><br />The crypto giant <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/binance-appoints-uk-director-mentions-need-to-uphold-regulations/">Binance,</a> as well as Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale, one of France&#8217;s largest banks, were granted the French license earlier this year.<br /><br />Regulators from around the world have become concerned as a result of a string of crypto sector collapses and market declines over the past year.</p>
<p>Policymakers encouraged hastened adoption of the EU-wide Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation following the most recent collapse of crypto exchange titan <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-transferred-assets-to-bahamas-government-after-bankruptcy/">FTX</a>. The financial regulators who will be writing the implementation laws in the upcoming year retorted that they are already under time constraints.<br /><br />The MiCA regulatory framework lays out detailed licensing requirements for cryptocurrency businesses. Many policy experts believe that had MiCA previously been in place, the impact of the FTX collapse on Europeans may have been lessened.</p>
