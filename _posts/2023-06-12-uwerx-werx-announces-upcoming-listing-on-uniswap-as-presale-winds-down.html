<p>Uwerx is positioned to be the best freelance platform for all freelancers worldwide. Through the platform&rsquo;s unique features, freelancers will have a community that hears their needs and helps them grow. Uwerx&rsquo;s presale is coming to a quick close. In this article, we discuss why Uwerxwill be your best investment.</p>
Uwerx (WERX): The Hub of Freelancing Solutions
<p>Freelancers all over the globe struggle with a plethora of challenges and obstacles on different freelancing platforms. From high flat fees to the inability to land gigs on these platforms, it has become a battle zone for freelancers seeking more gigs. Uwerx aims to solve these challenges and more.</p>
<p>Uwerx aims to solve several problems that freelancers face in the cryptocurrency industry. This is why the platform offers users a 1% flat fee, a significant reduction compared to the 10% and 20% flat fees offered by freelancing platforms such as Upwork and Fiverr. </p>
<p>Uwerx is growing beyond expectations. Within a few weeks of launching, the Uwerx platform has grown to over 6,000 signups. The social media platforms are not left out, as Uwerx&rsquo;s Twitter now has 1,627 followers, with Telegram boasting 1,456 subscribers. These numbers have only just begun to grow. With Uwerx&rsquo;s current listing on CoinSniper, and its scheduled listing on Uniswap by the 1st of August, these numbers are bound to quadruple in the coming months.</p>
<p>Uwerx is here to stay. Uwerx communicates this message to its growing community by announcing a 25-year liquidity lock on its tokens. After 82.8% of Uwerx&rsquo;s users voted for the lock to happen imminently, unlike after the presale as planned, the Uwerx team will make this lock happen before the end of the presale. </p>
<p>Uwerx has already exceeded all standards of the cryptocurrency industry. The platform proves this with its successful audit undergone by InterFi Network and SolidProof, both renowned authorities in the industry. Once Uwerx is launched on centralized exchanges, the Uwerx team will be renouncing contract ownership, thus ensuring transparency with the platform and reducing taxes to zero..</p>
<p>The Uwerx Team is also taking steps to transition the platform from the Alpha platform to the Beta platform. Through the Beta platform, Uwerx users can test the platform for themselves, and they are encouraged to share all forms of feedback with the Uwerx team at feedback@uwerx.network. </p>
The Uwerx (WERX) Presale is Exceeding Expectations!
<p>Due to the unexpectedly high demands for Uwerx, the Uwerx team has had to make essential token modifications to accommodate these demands. 98.2% of Uwerx users voted via a Twitter Poll for the Uwerx team to launch a Test Airdrop for the platform. This will be launched on the 31st of July, 2023. &nbsp;Uwerx itself will be launched on the 4th of August, 2023, opening freelancers and crypto investors up to a whole new world. </p>
<p>The Uwerx team has also unveiled the Uwerx Vault. Through this vault, Uwerx users can store their WERX tokens for different periods and access rewards based on the variables within the platform. </p>
<p>Uwerx&rsquo;s first presale stage was completed in only 17 days, while its second was completed within eight days. Uwerx is in its fifth presale stage, selling at $0.041 per token, with a 15% bonus on every purchase. Uwerx&rsquo;s hard-cap presale end date has been scheduled for the 31st of July, 2023.</p>
