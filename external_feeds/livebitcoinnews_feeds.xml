										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s happened again, folks. Another digital currency <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/crypto-options-exchange-deribit-hacked-for-28-million/ar-AA13EPZB" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/crypto-options-exchange-deribit-hacked-for-28-million/ar-AA13EPZB&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1668537726173000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1Lc1BgsFJ47xqNOr_dbzUm" data-wpel-link="external">hack is in the books</a>. This time, the victim is Deribit, a cryptocurrency exchange based in the Central American nation of Panama.</p>
<h2>Deribit Has Lost a Lot of Money</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, as much as $28 million in crypto assets have been stolen. The exchange confirmed the incident in a tweet a few weeks ago, claiming that it’s BTC, ETH, and USDC hot wallets had been compromised by malicious actors and inherently drained of the units they were holding. At press time, the company has confirmed that its cold storage wallets remain unaffected. The good news is that roughly 99 percent of all crypto units held by Deribit are placed in cold storage, so the incident could have been much worse.</p>
<p>The company also confirmed in a separate statement that the hack did not directly affect any user accounts, and thus all individuals’ monies remain safe and secure. Even still, Deribit has utilized an insurance policy since it began to cover these kinds of issues. Thus, customers can rest assured that if any funds had been stolen, they would have been instantly replaced. For the time being, the company has temporarily ended all withdrawal services and is conducting a security check of its systems.</p>
<p>Crypto exchanges and related businesses have often been the objects of affection of financial thieves, mostly because the crypto space is largely unregulated. There are not many rules in place designed to protect users, and this has been something of a two-sided coin in many ways (pardon the pun). On one hand, digital currency was designed to give all users financial independence and autonomy. Thus, there are no third parties or prying eyes to say what users can and can’t do with their funds.</p>
<p>While some argue that this is what crypto stands for, there are others that claim some level of regulation is necessary to prevent incidents like what has occurred with Deribit. They say some rules are necessary to keep customers safe and ensure their digital currency units remain unaffected.</p>
<p>According to a new report issued by blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/chainalysis-nearly-2-billion-in-crypto-has-been-stolen-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/chainalysis-nearly-2-billion-in-crypto-has-been-stolen-this-year/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1668537726173000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3nFMQ0kkYrOqEsewzdlEOC" data-wpel-link="internal">about $2 billion in digital</a> currency funds have been stolen in 2022 alone, and we still have a month left before the year is over.</p>
<h2>Does This Sound Familiar?</h2>
<p>There have been several incidents like this in the past. Two big ones that come to mind include <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/mt-gox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/mt-gox/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1668537726173000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1D0cEVkE_8gRqqtYVJjLOX" data-wpel-link="internal">Mt. Gox</a> and <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/coincheck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/coincheck/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1668537726173000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3bhvB_MepWOJ0va2aSDe-2" data-wpel-link="internal">Coincheck</a>, both of which occurred in Japan approximately four years apart from one another. Mt. Gox occurred in 2014 in the month of February. More than $400 million in BTC units were stolen and very little of that money has ever been given back.</p>
<p>Coincheck saw more than half a billion dollars’ worth of crypto stolen practically overnight in early 2018.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It would appear several crypto mining companies out there continue to either purchase or inherit machines – even though profits in the industry seem to be dying either due to falling crypto prices or growing energy prices. Thus, while the industry is ailing at press time, it’s not giving up completely.</p>
<h2>Crypto Mining Isn&#8217;t Giving Up</h2>
<p>Not long ago, Clean Spark – a crypto mining firm that runs on renewable energy – bought as many as 3,843 crypto mining machines. The <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/world/bitcoin-based-cleanspark-acquires-3843-cryptocurrency-miners/ar-AA13DX7z" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/world/bitcoin-based-cleanspark-acquires-3843-cryptocurrency-miners/ar-AA13DX7z&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1668537435189000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1q4k78kygEgjpyI3UCkII8" data-wpel-link="external">announcement was made</a> on November 1 of this year, and the machines are reported to be Antminer S19J Pro Bitcoin machines, meaning they’re relatively top of the line. They were purchased at roughly $15.50 per tera hash, which is considerably less than what these items would go for.</p>
<p>The company has been buying up loads of machines given several other crypto mining firms have been forced to either call it quits or <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/crypto-mining-firm-compute-north-files-for-bankruptcy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/crypto-mining-firm-compute-north-files-for-bankruptcy/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1668537435189000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1sV8aPMruqzX-mbVytlWqc" data-wpel-link="internal">file for bankruptcy</a> in the wake of the growing crypto winter. Matthew Schultz – executive chairman of Clean Spark – explained in a recent interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>These cities essentially become our utility provider. They make a margin on every kilowatt hour we buy to conduct our mining operations, yet we are buying such high quantities of energy that it brings down energy costs for the communities we work with.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not long ago, the company also bought up a new mining facility in the city of Washington, Georgia. Two months after that, it acquired another Georgia-based facility, meaning in a time when so many other crypto mining enterprises are downsizing or fully exiting the space, Clean Spark really seems to be growing like no other crypto business today.</p>
<p>While it may be expanding heavily, it’s not the only one with fortune stamped on its hind legs. Future FinTech Group – a blockchain application technology developer – has recently completed construction on a new crypto mining <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/future-fintech-announces-that-its-ohio-cryptocurrency-mining-farm-is-operational-as-it-deploys-the-first-phase-of-mining-machines-1031863649" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/future-fintech-announces-that-its-ohio-cryptocurrency-mining-farm-is-operational-as-it-deploys-the-first-phase-of-mining-machines-1031863649&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1668537435189000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3tf-JsVnUlt0UC3OfjMQQq" data-wpel-link="exclude">farm in northwest Ohio</a>. The first batch of its Antminer crypto mining machines have been put into operation, and the company is looking forward to some potentially huge profits.</p>
<h2>Building the New Farm</h2>
<p>Kai Xu – vice president of the company’s blockchain division – mentioned in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are pleased to have successfully deployed the first batch of Antminer S19 series mining machines in our Ohio cryptocurrency mining farm, which is the initial step of the first phase of the project to deploy approximately 12,000 S19 Antminers and accommodate about 1.3 EH/s of hash power in Ohio. Our strategic plan for this business segment is to develop cryptocurrency mining farms in different regions of the world and accelerate their deployment by using our own capabilities or through cooperation agreements with strong partners. We believe that our cryptocurrency mining farm in Ohio will be successful and will meet the goals that we have set out for it.</p></blockquote>

<li>The pair could continue to move up if it breaks the $0.055 resistance zone.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>TRON price started a fresh increase above $0.052 against the US Dollar, similar <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-aims-upside-break-above-18k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin</a>. TRX price could rise further if it clears the $0.055 resistance.</em></p>
<h2>Tron Price Analysis</h2>
<p>This past month, tron price started a decent increase from the $0.045 zone against the US Dollar. TRX price formed a base above the $0.0450 level and started a fresh increase.</p>
<p>It traded above the $0.0500 and $0.0520 resistance levels to move into a positive zone. The price even moved above the 55 simple moving average (4-hours), but the bulls were active near the $0.055 zone. A high was formed near $0.0551 before there was a downside correction.</p>
<p>There was a move below the $0.0535 level and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tron-trx-price-analysis-more-gains-if-it-clears-0-055/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4-hours)</a>. The price declined below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.0488 swing low to $0.055 high.</p>
<p>It is now trading below $0.0535 and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). Besides, there was a break above a declining channel with resistance near $0.0532 on the 4-hours chart. On the upside, TRX is facing resistance near the $0.0535 level.</p>
<p>The first major resistance is near the $0.055 level. A close above $0.055 is must for a fresh increase. In the stated case, the price could rise towards the $0.0620 resistance in the near term.</p>
<p>On the downside, an initial support is near the $0.0525 level. The next major support is now forming near $0.0520. It is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.0488 swing low to $0.055 high. If there is a downside break below the $0.0520 support, the price might revisit the $0.0500 support. Any more losses might call for a move towards the $0.0450 zone in the near term.</p>

<li>There is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $16,800 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>

</ul>
<p><em>Bitcoin price is recovering above $16,600 against the US Dollar. BTC might extend its recovery if it stays above the $16,750 support zone.</em></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price Analysis</h2>
<p>Bitcoin price remained well supported near the $16,000 zone. The price formed a base and started a <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-aims-fresh-increase-to-18-5k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">recovery wave</a> above the $16,200 level.</p>
<p>There was a recovery wave above the $16,500 resistance zone and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). The pair even cleared the $17,000 resistance zone. However, the bears appeared near the $17,420 zone. A high is formed near $17,424 and the price is now consolidating gains.</p>
<p>There was a move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $15,992 swing low to $17,424 high. It is now trading above $16,600 and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours).</p>
<p>An immediate resistance on the upside is near the $17,200 level. The next <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-recovery-could-soon-fade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">major resistance</a> might near the $17,425 zone. A clear move above the $17,425 level might send the price towards $18,000, above which the price might rise towards the $18,500 resistance.</p>
<p>Any more gains might push the price towards the $19,000 zone. If there is no upside break, the price might start a fresh decline below $16,800. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $16,800 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair.</p>
<p>The first major support is near the $16,700 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $15,992 swing low to $17,424 high.</p>
<p>The next key support is near the $16,200 level, below which the price might accelerate lower. In the stated case, the price could decline towards the $15,850 level. Any more losses might send the price towards the $15,000 level.</p>
<div id="attachment_75906" style="width: 1834px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2022/12/Bitcoin.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-75906" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-75906" src="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2022/12/Bitcoin.png" alt="Bitcoin Price" width="1834" height="845" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-75906" class="wp-caption-text">Bitcoin Price</p></div>
<p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XBTUSD/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="exclude">chart</a>, bitcoin price is clearly trading above $16,600 and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). Overall, the price could recover further if it clears the $17,420 resistance zone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With FTX filing bankruptcy and Sam Bankman-Fried now leaving the throes of his once-great company, Congress and the elites in Washington <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/washington-turns-up-heat-on-crypto-darling-sam-bankman-fried-following-near-collapse-of-ftx/ar-AA140Ll9" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">are once again turning</a> up the volume on their arguments for regulating the crypto space.</p>
<h2>Congress Is Coming After FTX</h2>
<p>There have been far too many accidents this year in the world of crypto. With companies like Celsius <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/another-mega-bitcoin-crash-is-in-the-books/" data-wpel-link="internal">suddenly halting withdrawals</a> and then <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/celsius-network-is-next-crypto-company-to-file-bankruptcy/" data-wpel-link="internal">filing for bankruptcy</a> and assets like the Terra Luna (allegedly) stable coin <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-luna-token-has-experienced-a-dramatic-drop/" data-wpel-link="internal">crashing to the ground</a>, many members of Congress are hoping to instill proper regulations to ensure people remain protected and that their investments are not tampered with.</p>
<p>This latest news surrounding FTX is making more members of Congress join the “we need crypto regulation” fight. The irony of the situation is that Bankman-Fried was a regular in our nation’s capital as an advocate for the space. Who would have thought his fall from grace would be so distinct that now the same people he pleaded and spoke with are calling for his testimony and indictment?</p>
<p>In a tweet following the collapse of his company, Bankman-Fried commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>I f*cked up and should have done better.</p></blockquote>
<p>The apology was not enough to sway regulators to feel sorry for him or go easy on him. Members of the House like Maxine Waters, a democrat in California and chair of the House Financial Services Committee, commented with:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now more than ever, it is clear that there are major consequences when cryptocurrency entities operate without robust federal oversight and protections for customers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Republican Patrick McHenry, who is the current GOP committee ranking member, also threw his two cents into the mix, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>The recent events show the necessity of congressional action. It&#8217;s imperative that Congress establish a framework that ensures Americans have adequate protections while also allowing innovation to thrive here in the U.S.</p></blockquote>
<p>In late 2021, Bankman-Fried told members of Congress at a hearing:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are irresponsible actors in the digital asset industry and those actors attract the headlines, but FTX is not one of them and in fact has built a resilient, risk-reducing platform as a competitive advantage.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jim Himes, a democrat from Connecticut and a fellow member of the House Financial Services Committee, commented that it’s likely Bankman-Fried will lose his access to Washington following the collapse of FTX. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now you see the Washington darling who knew people, mainly democrats, and that persona just evaporate… He was your classic founder, nerdy genius and you assumed he had twice the IQ you did.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Watchdogs Should Be in Place</h2>
<p>Lastly, Sherrod Brown – a democrat from Ohio and the chair of the Senate Banking Committee – said:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is crucial that our financial watchdogs look into what led to FTX&#8217;s collapse so we can fully understand the misconduct and abuses that took place.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A rumor was swirling around online that the nation of El Salvador in Central America had tons of <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/binance-chief-cz-says-el-salvador-didnt-hold-any-bitcoin-on-sam-bankman-frieds-collapsing-ftx/ar-AA140Mkt#interstitial=1" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">bitcoin locked away</a> in the FTX exchange, which has now filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy. However, many industry heads – including Changpeng Zhao of Binance, the company that at one point was likely to purchase FTX and save it from its present string of problems – are saying this is not true, and that the country is not in any danger.</p>
<h2>El Salvador Says It&#8217;s Not Tied to the Failed Exchange</h2>
<p>El Salvador is a rare region in that it has banked everything on digital currency over the last year. Initially labeling bitcoin legal tender in <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-fully-legal-in-el-salvador-beginning-september-7/" data-wpel-link="internal">September of 2021</a>, it was announced the world’s number one digital currency by market cap could be used alongside assets like USD to purchase everyday goods and services. This meant anyone could walk into a store or business somewhere in the country and purchase something with bitcoin, and those in charge had no choice but to accept it.</p>
<p>The move was met with heavy controversy as organizations such as <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-world-bank-will-not-help-el-salvador-with-its-btc-plans/" data-wpel-link="internal">the World Bank refused</a> to help El Salvador with the implementation of its bitcoin agenda, citing the asset as too volatile and risky to be taken seriously. In addition, many <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/el-salvador-residents-protest-forced-btc-usage/" data-wpel-link="internal">people rioted in the streets</a> of San Salvador, the nation’s capital, claiming that they didn’t appreciate having bitcoin forced upon them. They were concerned about the all the malicious and criminal activity that is often tied to BTC, and they didn’t want to see their country’s finances go up in flames.</p>
<p>Despite all these setbacks, El Salvador continued its journey as though nothing was happening, and while things initially appeared positive, the collapse of BTC has really put El Salvador on the edge.</p>
<p>The good news is that with these present rumors being debunked, it can be said that the country has bene smart when it comes to finding valid arenas in which to store its money. These arenas did not include the now failed digital currency exchange FTX, which is on the verge of filing bankruptcy and disappearing from the crypto industry for good.</p>
<p>Changpeng Zhao addressed rumors that the nation held bitcoin on the FTX exchange through the following tweet:</p>
<blockquote><p>Man, the amount of misinformation is insane. I exchanged messages with President Nayib a few moments ago. He said, &#8216;We don&#8217;t have any bitcoin in FTX, and we never had any business with them. Thank God!&#8217;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Responding to Misinformation?</h2>
<p>The conversation was in direct response to a tweet posted by bitcoin bull and billionaire hedge fund manager Mike Novogratz, who wrote the following on social media:</p>
<blockquote><p>I read – I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s true – that the El Salvadorian government&#8217;s crypto was on FTX, and they&#8217;re calling for the extradition of Sam [Bankman-Fried].</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FTX, one of the world’s biggest and most popular digital currency exchanges, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/11/cryptocurrency-exchange-ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-protection-in-us?amp;amp" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">has filed for bankruptcy</a>. This was abruptly followed by the formal resignation of the company’s founder and head executive Sam Bankman-Fried.</p>
<h2>FTX Has Fully Gone Under</h2>
<p>The company has been in hot water for the past several weeks. FTX experienced what’s been referred to as a “liquidity crunch” and initially sought the aid of its <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-ii-binance-said-it-would-buy-the-firm/" data-wpel-link="internal">main rival Binance to bail</a> it out of the dark hole that had been created for it. It appeared – at least for a while – that the larger firm was going to purchase the smaller one and become even more powerful in the long run, though this wasn’t to be.</p>
<p>Binance put out a statement saying that it was <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-iii-the-rise-and-fall-of-sam-bankman-fried/" data-wpel-link="internal">backing out of the deal</a> as the problems swarming FTX were too big and too complicated for it to handle. From there, with billions of dollars gone, FTX had no choice but to enter the same route that so many other cryptocurrency companies have taken this year, from Celsius to Three Arrows Capital.</p>
<p>2022 has become a year of bankrupt crypto enterprises, and it looks like this is a trend that’s set to continue. FTX is an odd case because just a few months ago, it had enough money to be <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-discusses-his-bailout-of-crypto-firms/" data-wpel-link="internal">bailing out some</a> of the other firms that were in trouble, though apparently, that money was already stretched too thin, and those in charge didn’t realize this. It has now joined the ranks of so many other failed crypto firms, suggesting that nobody in digital currency is safe.</p>
<p>Bankman-Fried is going to be replaced by American lawyer John J. Ray III, who previously served as the 2004 appointee to Enron when it was forced to liquidate all its holdings following massive financial fraud. In a statement online, Bankman-Fried told his followers:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m piecing together all the details, but I was shocked to see things unravel the way they did earlier this week. I will soon write up a more complete post on the play by play, but I want to make sure that I get it right when I do.</p></blockquote>
<p>Several players and analysts took to social media to express their thoughts on the news. Carol Alexander – a professor of finance at the University of Sussex – commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>The events of the past week have precipitated a Lehman Brothers moment for the entire crypto economy.</p></blockquote>
<h2>The Man Behind the Exchange Has Fallen</h2>
<p>The wealth of Bankman-Fried – once considered one of the richest individuals in the crypto arena – has all but vanished. At one point, Bankman-Fried was estimated to be worth a whopping $16.2 billion. This number was reported in early 2022.</p>
<p>Now, in a seething stroke of humiliation, the disgraced crypto exec’s net worth has fallen to a measly three dollars.</p>

<li>Ethereum price is gaining pace above the $1,200 level against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>ETH price is now trading above $1,220 and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours).</li>
<li>There is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,240 on the 4-hours chart (data feed from Coinbase).</li>

</ul>
<p><em>Ethereum price is rising above the $1,200 level against the US Dollar. ETH/USD could rise further if it clears the $1,300 resistance zone.</em></p>
<h2>Ethereum Price Analysis</h2>
<p>This past week, ethereum saw a <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-eth-at-risk-of-drop-below-1k-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">strong increase</a> above the $1,200 level against the US Dollar. ETH price was able to gain pace for a move above the $1,220 level and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours).</p>
<p>The upward move was such that the price broke the $1,250 resistance. It traded as high as $1,311 before there was a downside correction. There was a minor move below the $1,280 level. The price declined below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,150 swing low to $1,311 high.</p>
<p>However, the bulls were active near the $1,250 support zone. The price is now trading above $1,220 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-eth-at-risk-of-drop-below-1k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4-hours)</a>. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,240 on the 4-hours chart.</p>
<p>An immediate resistance on the upside is near the $1,280 level. The next major resistance is near the $1,300 zone. Any more gains could even send the price towards the $1,400 resistance zone in the near term. On the downside, an initial support is near the $1,240 level.</p>
<p>The next major support is now near the $1,230 level. It is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,150 swing low to $1,311 high.</p>
<p>A break below the $1,230 support could push the price to $1,180. Any more losses could lead the price towards $1,100, below which there is a risk of a larger decline in the coming days.</p>
