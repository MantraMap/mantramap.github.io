  (LINK) Ready to Rise'

<p>The cryptocurrency space is full of potential opportunities, and the market outlook for Orbeon Protocol (ORBN), Fantom (FTM), and Chainlink (LINK) looks especially promising. Today, we review these three coins and assess why they could be poised for a major rise in the near future.</p>
<p>With Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) nearing the end of the public presale, we may have to move quickly.</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN)</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) could potentially revolutionize crowdfunding as we know it, with these four distinct features:</p>
<p>1) Blockchain-based - Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) uses the power of the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain to provide safety and transparency.</p>
<p>2) Fractionalized NFTs - NFTs are useful for more than just collecting digital art. With fractional NFTs that represent ownership of a startup, investors can use just $1 to become part-owners of the project.</p>
<p>3) Smart contracts - Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) uses smart contracts to automate the whole crowdfunding process, eliminating a lot of paperwork and manual labor.</p>
<p>4) Utility token - As a decentralized project, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) uses a utility token to reward investors for their contributions. Holding ORBN grants passive income staking rewards, governance votes, first access to new startups, and more.</p>
<p>With such a game-changing approach to the $13.5B crowdfunding industry, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is one to watch out for. The current Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) presale represents an amazing opportunity to get in on the ground floor.</p>
<p>Fantom (FTM)</p>
<p>Fantom (FTM) is an open-source, public blockchain platform designed to enable fast and secure transactions across the globe. Fantom (FTM) is built using a revolutionary consensus mechanism called Lachesis, which is designed to enable instant finality and scalability.</p>
<p>But the main difference between Fantom (FTM) and most other projects is the fact that Fantom (FTM) isn't a blockchain at all! Fantom (FTM) is actually a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which enables much faster transaction speeds and more secure transactions.</p>
<p>Fantom (FTM) is already being utilized by governments around the world, with the likes of Uzbekistan planning to use Fantom (FTM) as part of their digital transformation. This shows that Fantom (FTM) has strong fundamentals, making it a prime candidate for a major rise this year.</p>
<p>Chainlink (LINK)</p>
<p>Chainlink (LINK) is making a name for itself as the go-to blockchain platform for decentralized finance (Defi). Chainlink (LINK) has been designed to be an intermediary between off-chain resources and Ethereum smart contracts, allowing developers to incorporate external data into their products via Chainlink (LINK).</p>
<p>Chainlink (LINK) sounds good in theory, and it also looks like the practice is measuring up &mdash; Chainlink (LINK) is already being used by some of the top Defi platforms including MakerDao, Aave, Compound, and others.</p>
<p>If that's not enough adoption for you, then the news of Accuweather and FedEx using Chainlink (LINK) should be convincing. Accuweather is using Chainlink (LINK) to provide live weather data feeds into their smart contracts, while FedEx is integrating Chainlink (LINK) to provide real-time shipment tracking.</p>
