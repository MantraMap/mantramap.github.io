ZachXBT&#8217;s analysis of the hacks on payment providers Alphapo and Coinspaid point to the infamous North Korean cybercrime organization. Losses from the hacks on decentralized wallet Atomic Wallet and Alphaho exceed $160 million combined. Coinspaid suspended withdrawals citing a &#8220;technical issue&#8221; around the same time hackers attacked Alphapo. Out of the ROK, Lazarus comes forth!
