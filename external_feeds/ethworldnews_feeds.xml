<ul><li>Worldcoin has published two security audit reports that cover areas like key encryption, vulnerabilities, and data privacy.&nbsp;</li><li>The three-month-long security audits were performed by audit firms Nethermind and Least Authority.&nbsp;</li><li>The audits revealed 29 issues, which were subsequently resolved by the blockchain protocol.&nbsp;</li><li>The audit reports were published just hours after France’s privacy watchdog launched a probe into Worldcoin.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Worldcoin, the ambitious crypto project recently launched by ChatGPT founder <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-altmans-worldcoin-wld-up-70/">Sam Altman</a>, has published security audit reports amid mounting concerns regarding its privacy and safety. The audit reports came just hours after France’s top privacy watchdog stated that it was investigating the blockchain protocol. </p>



<h2><strong>Auditors Find 29 Security Issues In Worldcoin</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://worldcoin.org/blog/worldcoin/worldcoin-protocol-security-audit-reports" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a> by Worldcoin, two separate audit firms were tapped to carry out separate suits that lasted three months. During the audit, audit firms Nethermind and Least Authority focused on several key areas, including the correctness of the implementation, appropriate use of smart contract constructs, adversarial actions, exposure of critical information during user interaction, etc. </p>



<p>The audit firms also scanned the blockchain protocol for case-specific implementation errors, resistance to attacks like DDoS, vulnerabilities in the codebase, etc. From a privacy and security point of view, the audit also covered areas like secure key storage, proper management of encryption and signing keys, data privacy, information integrity, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nethermind’s audit focused on Worldcoin’s smart contracts, including the World ID contracts, World ID example airdrops, the WLD ERC-20 token contract, and the associated vesting wallet, etc. The firm found 26 issues during the assessment, 2 of which were critical and 2 were medium issues. The protocol has resolved 24 issues and mitigated one so far.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Least Authority’s audit took a closer look at Worldcoin’s use of cryptography, particularly the cryptographic design and implementation. The audit firm identified three issues, all of which were solved. According to Least Authority, the cryptographic component was generally well-designed and implemented.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Worldcoin’s audit reports came amid mounting concerns regarding the protocol’s privacy and safety. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/frances-privacy-watchdog-says-worldcoin-legality-seems-questionable-2023-07-28/" rel="nofollow noopener">Reuters</a> reported earlier today that France’s privacy watchdog CNIL launched an investigation into the blockchain protocol’s operations, particularly the collection of biometric data. Questioning the legality of extracting and storing the public’s biometric data, the CNIL joined hands with the Bavarian state authority in Germany to conduct the investigation. </p>

<ul><li>Binance withdrew its German crypto license application after being advised by the country’s financial regulator.&nbsp;</li><li>Germany’s BaFin reportedly expressed concerns over founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao.&nbsp;</li><li>The German regulator stated that the exchange had a complicated structure and questioned CZ’s ability to run it.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>BaFin, Germany’s top financial regulator, reportedly advised Binance to withdraw its crypto license application prior to the crypto exchange’s announcement about pausing its German expansion, which came earlier this week. The regulator’s advice stemmed from concerns over the exchange’s founder and Chief Executive, Changpeng Zhao, along with other regulatory concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>BaFin Questioned Zhao’s Ability To Run Binance</strong></h2>



<p>When Binance <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-cancels-german-crypto-license/">stated</a> on July 26 that it was withdrawing its application for a crypto custody license from German regulators, it cited the changing regulatory landscape and the global market situation for its decision to pause its expansion amid regulatory scrutiny. </p>



<p>However, the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/binances-founder-drew-scrutiny-from-german-regulator-2e890a31" rel="noopener">Wall Street Journal</a> reported today that Germany’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) advised the crypto exchange to withdraw the application, citing concerns over the firm’s structure and its founder Changpeng Zhao. </p>



<p>BaFin was of the opinion that Changpeng Zhao wouldn’t pass a “fit and proper” test, people familiar with the matter told WSJ. The test is reportedly used to assess an individual’s reputation and professional ability to run a business it supervises. An internal Binance document viewed by WSJ further revealed that the German regulator also expressed concerns over the crypto exchange’s complicated structure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The internal document, which detailed key elements of Binance’s global expansion campaign, stated that BaFin had an issue with the exchange’s structure, particularly its potential to hinder regulatory supervision. In light of the concerns, the regulator advised the crypto exchange to withdraw its crypto license application.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Binance previously told WSJ that the decision to withdraw the crypto license application was motivated by multiple factors, including efforts to secure a new European Union crypto license. The spokesperson added that the exchange intended to reapply for a German license in the future, after making appropriate changes to the application.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The company was approved by the Dutch regulator after a thorough review of its compliance with local anti-money laundering rules and other financial policies. “Collaborating with regulators to responsibly advance the crypto and blockchain industry is of paramount importance to Crypto.com,” CEO Kris Marszalek said hailing the approval as a major win for his company. </p>

<p>MiCA also mandates that stablecoin issuers operate with sufficient reserves to meet demands. </p>

<ul><li>Polygon partnered with web3 wallet Suku to launch an open edition NFT collection minted on Twitter.&nbsp;</li><li>The crypto community on Twitter minted more than 50,000 NFTs within 48 hours.&nbsp;</li><li>Suku leveraged Twitter for its user-centric approach to onboard newcomers into crypto.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Polygon, the popular Ethereum layer 2 scaling solution, recently partnered with Web3 payment services firm Suku to launch an unprecedented open edition <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/google-play-supports-nfts-in-apps-games/">NFT</a> collection that was entirely minted on Twitter. Users on Twitter minted more than 50,000 NFTs during the 48-hour mint window by making a tweet tagging Polygon and Suku. </p>



<h2><strong>Suku Leveraged Polygon And Twitter To Simply Crypto Onboarding</strong></h2>



<p>The free NFT collection from Suku was announced to celebrate the launch of Polygon 2.0. The NFT campaign led to Suku getting more than 48,000 wallet downloads, the web3 payments firm stated in a <a href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/polygon_and_suku_launch_the_first_ever_open_edition_nft_collection_minted_entirely_via_twitter/prweb19460480.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a>. Suku and Polygon received over 88,000 social mentions, 18 million users reached, and over 22 million impressions through the free NFT collection.</p>



<p>For managing the NFTs minted on Twitter, Suku offered NFT holders its web3 wallet, which can be accessed with their Twitter account. According to Suku, by eliminating the complex onboarding process associated with NFTs and the broader crypto space, it promoted blockchain inclusivity.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>By integrating its tools with popular platforms like Twitter, where users already spend their time, Suku is pioneering a user-centric approach to blockchain technology.”</p><cite>Suku team</cite></blockquote>



<p>Suku’s social web3 wallet also allows users to send and receive crypto instantly. Users who haven’t signed up for the wallet can access it by using their Twitter handle as a wallet address, essentially making it the crypto transfer service on Twitter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Suku stated that utilizing a fast and scalable blockchain like Polygon was a key element of its plan to foster crypto adoption and attract new users to the blockchain space, in addition to other incentives such as zero gas fees on minting NFTs and access to a web3 wallet that wouldn’t require seed phrases or private keys. The firm plans to expand to other social media platforms, including Face, Reddit, Instagram, and LinkedIn.</p>

<ul><li>MakerDAO is set to introduce the Enhanced DAI Savings Rate (EDSR) to raise the interest rate for DAI holders to up to 8%. </li><li>The community behind the DeFi lending protocol voted overwhelmingly in favor of the EDSR. </li><li>The proposal was introduced to stabilize DAI’s supply after the stablecoin’s circulation was reduced by a third.</li></ul>



<p>DeFi lending protocol MakerDAO is considering introducing the Enhanced DAI Savings Rate (EDSR) in a bid to increase the adoption of its DAI stablecoin. Earlier today, the community behind Maker concluded a <a href="https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmcTRPLx#vote-breakdown" rel="nofollow noopener">governance vote</a> that would pave the way to provide an interest rate of as much as 8% to DAI holders. </p>



<h2><strong>MakerDAO Looks To Increase DAI’s Adoption</strong></h2>



<p>The <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/makerdao-buys-700-million-us-treasuries/">MakerDAO</a> community voted overwhelmingly in favor of the proposal to enforce the Enhanced DAI Savings Rate, with less than 0.5% votes against it. The vote began on July 24 and concluded earlier today, with over 99.9% of the community in favor of the EDSR. </p>



<p>According to the proposal posted on MakerDAO’s governance forum by the protocol’s founder Rune Christensen, the EDSR will temporarily raise the DAI savings rate (DSR) available to users when the DSR utilization is low. Once the utilization gets high enough, the one-time EDSR mechanism will disappear.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Maker’s current DAI savings rate of 3.19% is among the highest in decentralized finance. However, it has failed to spur the growth in demand and capital inflow that the DeFi lending protocol is looking for. The EDSR would hike the savings rate to as high as 8%, more than double what rival lending protocols like Aave and Compound offer. </p>



<p>The high-interest rate is expected to incentivize stablecoin users to consider DAI rather than popular rivals like USDT and USDC. The EDSR would allow DAI holders to get a bigger proportion of the protocol’s earnings.  </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>I believe we need to decisively focus on the most important short term mission: Grow the demand for Dai and DSR.”</p><cite>Rune Christensen, Founder of MakerDAO</cite></blockquote>



<p>The governance vote came amid concerns over DAI’s circulation, which declined by a third over the past year. The <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/multi-collateral-dai/" rel="nofollow noopener">DAI</a> stablecoin, which boasts a market capitalization of $4.5 billion, has also witnessed a decline of over 80% in its daily trading volume since last year. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House to more decentralized applications (dApps) than any other L1 blockchain, Q2 was marked by increased new demand for BNB Chain, Messari found. According to the report, the number of average new unique addresses grew significantly by 91.1% during the quarter under review, reaching “all-time highs after a spike in activity in late April.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The uptick in new demand for BNB Chain in Q2 was due to the decline in network transaction fees. BNB Chain gas fees were reduced drastically after BSC validators</span><a href="https://www.bsc.news/post/bsc-validators-vote-to-slash-gas-fees-by-40-on-bnb-chain-transactions#:~:text=BSC%20validators%20have%20voted%20to,cost%20Ethereum%20layer%2D2%20networks." target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in favor of a 40% reduction in transaction fees from 5 to 3 Gwei. The average daily transaction fee on the chain fell by 26% in Q2.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result of the transaction fee decrease, daily transactions on BNB Chain increased. Daily transactions count on the chain grew by 24% between April and June, Messari found. The growth in transactions count was “largely tied to increased activity from LayerZero.”</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“After LayerZero announced its $120 million Series B fundraising on April 4, activity spiked on many of its supported networks. By June, BNB Chain was hosting 200,000-250,000 LayerZero and Stargate daily transactions and 50,000-60,000 daily unique addresses from those transactions. In addition to Stargate, activity also stemmed from Radiant Capital, an omnichain money market built on LayerZero that deployed on BNB Chain in Q1,” the report stated.</span></p></blockquote>

<h3><strong>Revenue shortfall and a drop in BNB value</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the growth in user activity on BNB Chain, the network’s revenue took a beating in Q2. With a quarterly revenue of $52.24 million recorded, a 6.1% decline was recorded QoQ. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Likewise, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulatory activity against Binance put some pressure on the network’s native coin BNB. In June, the regulator filed a complaint against  Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ), alleging that it engaged in the sale and offering of unregistered securities. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The SEC complaint in June coincided with downward pressure on the value of BNB, which declined 25.2%. In contrast, the total crypto market cap increased by 2% QoQ, which was primarily driven by BTC and ETH, rising 7% and 6%, respectively. Alt-L1 tokens tended to decrease more than ETH due to the SEC’s regulatory complaints. BNB concluded the quarter as the fourth largest cryptoasset by market capitalization, reaching $37.5 billion, Messari found.”</span></p></blockquote>

<p>The hacker who stole $3.4 million from DeFi lending protocol EraLend snubbed a 2 PM deadline to return some of the stolen funds and keep a portion of the loot as a white hat bounty. </p>



<p>On July 26, the EraLend team <a href="https://twitter.com/Era_Lend/status/1684203337388883969?s=20" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/Era_Lend/status/1684203337388883969?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">proposed</a> a deal with the unidentified hacker. The terms offered a white hat bounty worth 10% of the stolen funds if the hacker returned 90% of the assets to wallet address <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x9eEE479DCf6075a0cb905c27e8F952910c3bb69D" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://etherscan.io/address/0x9eEE479DCf6075a0cb905c27e8F952910c3bb69D" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">0x9eEE479DCf6075a0cb905c27e8F952910c3bb69D</a>. </p>



<p>Typically, white hat bounties are offered to hackers or sleuths who discover bugs in smart contract codes. This route is also taken by protocols seeking to recover their stolen assets peacefully. </p>



<p>The DeFi lender set a deadline of 2 PM UTC today though the deadline has now passed and the hacker did not return the funds as proposed. EraLend promised to tap the broader DeFi community, centralized exchanges (CEXs), and law enforcement should the hacker continue to hold user funds hostage. </p>



<p>Furthermore, the platform opened its 10% bounty to the public and implored anyone with information on the hacker&#8217;s identity to come forward. </p>

<h2>EraLend Update</h2>



<p>The DeFi protocol which runs atop Ethereum L2 network zkSync updated users today on three developments. Firstly, the team identified a suspicious CEX account that may be involved in the hack. </p>



<p>Also, a formal request was sent to a VPN provider that the team believes was used by the attacker to hide their identity. The protocol is also working with security experts for an autopsy on the attack vectors deployed before and after the $3.4 million hack. </p>



<p>EraLend suffered a read-only reentrancy attack on July 25, allowing the hacker to drain millions in crypto from the platform. The exploiter then moved a chunk of the funds to addresses on Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Optimism per security shop Peckshield. </p>

<ul><li>The SUI Foundation has terminated its relationship with the decentralized exchange MovEx.&nbsp;</li><li>The move came after MovEx violated the lockup schedule for SUI tokens leading to an oversupply in the open market.&nbsp;</li><li>Sui network’s native token SUI has gained more than 4% over the past 24 hours.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Sui Foundation, the organization behind the development of the Sui ecosystem, has terminated its relationship with decentralized exchange MovEx after the latter violated the lockup schedule of the Sui network’s native token SUI. The violation was discovered following an investigation by the foundation that was launched after the crypto community on Twitter accused the Sui team of misrepresenting emissions and dumping locked tokens.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>SUI Gains 4% After Dumping DEX MovEx</strong></h2>



<p>MovEx dumped hundreds of thousands of the 2.5 million SUI tokens that were given to it under a contractual lockup as payment for its contribution to Sui’s native order book Deepbook, the Sui Foundation stated in a <a href="https://twitter.com/SuiNetwork/status/1684456782297718785" rel="nofollow noopener">tweet</a> earlier today. MovEx breached the token lockup contract by sending roughly 625,000 SUI tokens to three unique wallets. </p>



<p>The Sui Foundation clarified that it had no knowledge of these transfers. While the 625,000 SUI from the initial transfer remained in the original wallet, the entire allotment of 2.5 million SUI was moved to a qualified crypto custodian by July 3.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The violation of the token lockup schedule prompted Sui to end its relationship with the decentralized exchange. The foundation stated that no additional tokens would be allotted to the MovEx team, and the lockup schedule of the previously allotted tokens would be enforced by the qualified custodian.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>At this time, all other tokens subject to contractual lockups are held in qualified custodian accounts that have agreed to enforce the terms of such lockups.” </p><cite>Sui Foundation</cite></blockquote>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Exclusive new research on SUI:<br><br>Intentionally misrepresented emissions and proof the team themselves are dumping rewards from *locked* and *non-circulating* staked SUI onto Binance.

<p>The investigation into MovEx’s transactions was launched after Crypto influencer DefiSquared accused the Sui team of misrepresenting token emissions and dumping rewards from locked SUI tokens on crypto exchange <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-cancels-german-crypto-license/">Binance</a>. </p>



<p>The Sui network’s native token <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/sui/" rel="nofollow noopener">SUI</a> has lost more than 10% of its value over the past week. However, the past 24 hours saw the token gain over 4%. At the time of writing, SUI was trading at $0.644, with a market capitalization of $421 million.</p>

<p>Federal prosecutors do not plan to press charges against former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried for alleged campaign finance lawbreaking due to a legal bind in extradition papers signed with the Bahamas government. </p>



<p>Bankman-Fried was extradited from the Bahamas to the United States on December 21 following his earlier arrest in Nassau. At the time, the Department of Justice had <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-conspiracy-fraud/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-conspiracy-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">indicted</a> SBF on eight charges including violating U.S. campaign finance rules. The charges have increased to <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/not-guilty-sam-bankman-fried-charges-ftx/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/not-guilty-sam-bankman-fried-charges-ftx/" rel="noreferrer noopener">12 counts</a> since then. </p>



<p>However, <a href="http://chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940.181.0.pdf" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940.181.0.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">court documents</a> show that these charges were omitted from the extradition papers issued by Bahamian authorities. The DOJ intends to drop this charge from its prosecution of Bankman-Fried citing &#8220;treaty obligations&#8221;, United States Attorney Damian Williams wrote on Wednesday to Judge Lewis Kaplan.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The Government has been informed that The Bahamas notified the United States earlier today that The Bahamas did not intend to extradite the defendant on the campaign contributions count. Accordingly, in keeping with its treaty obligations to The Bahamas, the Government does not intend to proceed to trial on the campaign contributions count.</p></blockquote>



<p>SBF and his FTX crypto exchange reportedly donated tens of millions of dollars to bipartisan candidates in a bid to boost Bankman-Fried&#8217;s social capital. Prosecutors argue that the former FTX boss made these donations with stolen customer funds. </p>



<h2>Bankman-Fried&#8217;s $250 Million Bail Reviewed In FTX Case</h2>



<p>The DOJ <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/prosecutor-revoke-sam-bankman-fried-bail/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/prosecutor-revoke-sam-bankman-fried-bail/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">requested</a> a review of SBF&#8217;s bail agreement after the accused leaked the diary of Caroline Ellison, Alameda&#8217;s former CEO and Bankman-Fried&#8217;s supposed girlfriend. SBF&#8217;s diary leak to the New York Times affects the trial and could be considered witness tampering, U.S. attorneys argued. </p>



<p>Judge Kaplan issued a gag order on SBF, meaning that Bankman-Fried is legally bound from speaking to the press or making any &#8220;extrajudicial statements&#8221;. Federal prosecutors and SBF&#8217;s lawyers are expected to file arguments regarding Bankman-Fried&#8217;s detention terms moving forward.</p>

<ul><li>The Gemini Foundation is set to host its first trading competition next month.&nbsp;</li><li>The Gemini Leaderboard competition will reward as much as 250 GUSD to derivatives traders on the exchange.&nbsp;</li><li>The derivatives crypto exchange aims to attract traders and grow its user base.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Gemini Foundation, the derivatives exchange founded by billionaire entrepreneurs Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, is set to host its first trading competition next month. The international crypto derivatives exchange, which was launched in May by the Winklevoss-owned American crypto exchange, is hoping to leverage the trading competition to lure new users to the platform.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Gemini Aims To Attract Users After Decline In Trading Volume</strong> </h2>



<p>The Winklevoss twins plan to launch the Gemini Leaderboard competition on August 1, 2023, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-26/winklevoss-gamify-overseas-derivatives-exchange-to-boost-demand?srnd=cryptocurrencies-v2#xj4y7vzkg" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a> reported earlier today. The leaderboard will track the performance of crypto traders on the international derivatives trading platform and reward the top-performing traders accordingly. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/gemini-sues-barry-silbert-dcg-fraud-earn/">Gemini</a> Foundation will host multiple competitions, each with unique rules, objectives, and duration. The best traders will be rewarded as much as 250 GUSD every day. The competition will not be available for users in the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union. </p>



<p>Traders who are interested in participating in the competition will have to fund their derivatives account with at least 250 GUSD before the end of the month. This amount would have to be maintained in the account throughout the duration of the competition. The first competition will end on August 31, 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The promotional event comes amid Gemini’s declining trading volume. Data from <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/gemini#reserve" rel="nofollow noopener">CoinGecko</a> showed that the crypto exchange’s trading volume declined by more than 87% over the past year, going from $147 million to almost $18 million at the time of writing. As per the exchange’s self-reported <a href="https://www.gemini.com/trust-center" rel="nofollow noopener">proof of reserves</a>, it currently holds $6.4 billion worth of crypto. </p>



<p>When regulators in the United States cracked down on the crypto industry, the Winklevoss twins looked offshore to set up a derivatives platform and increase their crypto firm’s global presence, which led to the establishment of the Gemini Foundation. The GUSD stablecoin serves as the derivatives exchange’s primary token, and perpetual contracts offered on the trading platform are denominated in GUSD.&nbsp;</p>
