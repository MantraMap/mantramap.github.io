			  <description><![CDATA[<p>An expert on crypto has recently postulated that criminals are leaving Bitcoin in order to use stablecoins, which are considered to be an easier go-to for illegal financial activities.</p>
From Bitcoin to Stablecoins
<p>It has often been suggested, especially in the mainstream media, that&nbsp; Bitcoin was one of the main currencies in which to transact illicit activities. However, recent insights suggest a shift in this trend. Originally reported by CoinTelegraph, Tara Annison, the former head of technical crypto advisory at Elliptic, stated that the criminal underbelly of the crypto world is now leaning more towards stablecoins, particularly USD Coin (USDC), over Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Annison, during her presentation at EthCC in Paris, delved into the changing dynamics of crypto-related crimes. She pointed out that Bitcoin's decreasing popularity among criminals can be attributed to the rise of decentralised finance protocols, mixing services, and most notably, stablecoins. These digital assets, especially those pegged to the dollar, offer new, more discreet avenues for illicit transactions.</p>
Why the shift to stablecoins?
<p>Annison explains that assets like USDC offer easy access and can be effortlessly laundered through decentralised exchanges (DEXs). She remarked that in her view the deep liquidity and substantial volume on these platforms make them ideal for such activities.</p>
<p>However, it's not all gloomy. Annison highlighted a potential advantage for law enforcement agencies. Centralised issuers, such as Circle, have the capability to freeze specific USDC tokens. This means that before these criminals can convert their assets into fiat currencies through DEXs or centralised platforms, their funds can be halted. Annison commented that in her opinion we are witnessing a rise in blacklisted USDC and USDT accounts, effectively freezing assets that criminals can't access.</p>
$7.8 billion in scams
<p>Annison went on to say that stablecoins aren't the only concern. Ponzi and pyramid schemes continue to plague the crypto sector. A staggering $7.8 billion has been syphoned off from unsuspecting victims through these scams. Moreover, criminals are constantly innovating, employing techniques like chain swapping and asset swapping to obscure their tracks, using a myriad of tools, from DEXs to mixers, in order to muddy the trail for blockchain analytics firms.</p>
<p>In the light of crypto scams decreasing by 46% compared to previous years, Annison believes the current bear market in crypto is a significant factor, suggesting that with reduced hype and lower prices, the sector becomes less lucrative for criminals.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Bearish Sentiment Expanding:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 22 July 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) encountered elevated downside risks early in the Asian session as the pair has been increasingly unable to sustain recent gains above the 30000 figure.&nbsp; &nbsp;Bears absorbed the 30183.73 level during the ongoing pullback, a level that represents the 23.6% retracement of the appreciating range from 24750 to 31862.21.&nbsp;&nbsp; Stops were elected below the 30172, 30095, 30018, 29922, and 29768 areas during the depreciation, downside price objectives associated with selling pressure around the 30421.29 and 30281.68 areas.&nbsp; Additional downside price objectives include the 29403, 29089, 28775, 28386, and 27757 levels.&nbsp; Below current price activity, the 28095.44 area represents the 23.6% retracement of the historical depreciating range from 69000 to 15460.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Following recent upside activity, areas of technical support and potential buying pressure include the 28306, 27466, 26428, and 26272 levels.&nbsp; Above the market, upside price objectives related to this level include the 30526, 30611, 30762, and 31145 areas.&nbsp; Upside price objectives related to other levels of buying pressure include the 32125 and 33569 areas, and Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 32043, 34531, 34658, and 35912 areas.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and below the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;200-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 29685.25 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 29992.93.</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;24440.41/ 23270.10/ 22769.39 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;31986.16/ 32989.19/ 34658.69 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bearishly below SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bullishly above MACDAverage.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bearishly below SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bearishly below MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Seoul, South Korea, July 21st, 2023, Chainwire</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Superblock, a contributor to Over Protocol, has raised $8 million from prominent companies and VCs in South Korea across two funding rounds. Investors included SK, Netmarble, DSC, E&amp;Investment, Schmidt, SpringCamp, and NaverZ.</p>
Ben (Jae-Yun) Kim, the founder of Superblock, said: "We are deeply diving into the South Korea market with the best local partners and looking to meet global partners accelerating us all over the world."
<p>As layer 1 blockchains have become faster and more established over time, the costs of bootstrapping and maintaining nodes have become increasingly expensive. As a consequence, blockchain applications have become challenging to operate without the use of costly equipment.</p>
<p>Over Protocol is a new layer 1 blockchain based on a protocol named "Ethanos" that only considers active accounts valid, enabling full nodes to discard obsolete data and operate with less storage, thus allowing for reduced storage requirements. With Over, anyone will be able to run a node and become a validator on their PCs at home. Ethanos has been published at EuroSys&rsquo;21.</p>
"With the ability for anyone to run a validator, individuals can earn potentially passive income through a process called home staking, enabling them to embrace a new lifestyle with new payment options, enhanced credit, and innovative finance opportunities," Ben added.

<p>Superblock builds products, tools, and decentralized applications to flourish the Over Protocol. Over Protocol is a truly decentralized layer 1 blockchain providing lightweight full nodes.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Proof Collective is trying to rekindle interest in its Moonbirds NFTs with a brand new 20,000-piece Mythics collection, released almost a year after its initial mention in August 2022.</p>
Proof Collective Drops New Collection
<p>Moonbirds, the once-celebrated NFT brand, is making a comeback with the launch of its 20,000-piece collection, Mythics, which is also the latest Ethereum profile picture (PFP) collection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proof Collective, the company behind Moonbirds, aims to rekindle interest among NFT collectors after facing a significant decline in sales since its first release in April 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mythics collection is the result of nearly a year of development and will be introduced gradually. Proof revealed that it will unveil 100 new NFTs today, followed by an additional 100 NFTs daily for the next 200 days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Half of the 100 new NFTs revealed daily would be randomly selected claimed eggs, while the other half would be 50 Oddities chosen to be burned. The slow rollout is a strategic move to enrich the underlying intellectual property and keep the community engaged.</p>
More About The Mythics Collection
<p>The upcoming Mythics collection is considered a more genuine follow-up to Moonbirds than its predecessor, Oddities. The team at Proof Collective delved deep into the lore of the Moonbirds world to ensure that the new collection offers an engaging and entertaining experience for collectors.</p>
<p>The new collection has been classified into three categories, depending on their functionality and power - the stone eggs, legendary eggs, and runic eggs. The first two types are rarer as they consist of only 20% of the collection each. All these eggs can spawn a specific number of Mythic forms; for legendary eggs, it is three; for runic eggs, it is two; and a stone egg can only spawn one. The person who is minting the NFT gets to choose which form of Mythic to spawn from each type of egg.</p>
Change In Licensing Model&nbsp;
<p>Once minted and in possession of a Mythic NFT, the holder will have complete commercial rights over the artwork and even be able to use the characters&rsquo; IP. This is a major change from the two earlier Moonbirds collections, which followed a Creative Commons CC0 licensing model. As a result, anyone could commercially reproduce and use the NFT artworks from those collections, even without owning the NFT.&nbsp;</p>
Will Moonbirds Regain Their Popularity?&nbsp;
<p>The cooling interest in the NFT market has impacted Moonbird sales, with average sale prices plummeting almost tenfold from their initial high.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Led by co-founder and CEO Kevin Rose and supported by top crypto venture capitalist a16z, the Proof is expanding the Moonbirds brand lore to rekindle interest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rose said,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With Mythics, we&rsquo;re really trying to give our community a new experience that links together the Proof ecosystem and expands the storytelling that started with Moonbirds. I&rsquo;m so proud of how hard our teams have been working on this launch, with the goal of expanding Moonbirds' storytelling both through art and technology.&rdquo;</p>

</p>
<p>The UK government rejected lawmakers&rsquo; proposal to treat crypto trading and related investment assets as it does gambling instruments.</p>
<p>The House of Commons Treasury Committee argued that unbacked, mainstream crypto assets such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) should be held to the same standards as gambling. In its report, the Committee said:</p>

<p>With no intrinsic value, huge price volatility and no discernible social good, consumer trading of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin more closely resembles gambling than a financial service, and should be regulated as such.</p>

<p>Andrew Griffith, the UK Economic Secretary to the Treasury, said it &ldquo;firmly disagrees&rdquo; with the &ldquo;Committee&rsquo;s recommendation to regulate retail trading and investment activity in unbacked cryptoassets as gambling rather than as a financial service.&rdquo;</p>
Regulating Crypto as Gambling Would Drive Crypto Offshore
<p>In its response to the Committee&rsquo;s concerns, Griffith stated that such an approach to regulation would defy the globally agreed-upon standards and potentially drive crypto activity offshore.</p>
<p>The government also opined that such a law would fail to address certain risks associated with crypto trading, such as market manipulation.</p>
Regulating Crypto in the UK
<p>The government further stated it is already working on crypto asset regulation, and proposed rules were put before parliament and debated last month. In its response, the government said:</p>

<p>HM Treasury and the FCA [Financial Conduct Authority] will work with the industry to ensure crypto firms are made fully aware of the standards required for approval at the FSMA gateway.</p>
<p>Further communications will be provided in due course to ensure standards for approval are clearly available to crypto firms operating in the UK.</p>

<p>Regulators in the UK have made strides in crypto regulation to address global concerns over the industry&rsquo;s risks.</p>
<p>The House of Lords recently passed the Financial Services and Markets Bill, which aims to regulate Bitcoin and crypto in the country.</p>
<p>Deemed a &ldquo;Rocket Boost for the UK economy,&rdquo; the bill seeks to make a &ldquo;technologically advanced financial services sector&rdquo; that is &ldquo;open&rdquo; and will &ldquo;grow the economy.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The recently uncovered personal diaries of Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison could be used as key evidence in the upcoming trial of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried.&nbsp;</p>
Ellison&rsquo;s Diaries Could Be Used In Court
<p>The diaries, both handwritten and private Google documents, contain the rantings and ramblings of the 27-year-old CEO and will provide an insight into the events leading up to the FTX calamity. Bankman-Fried is facing charges of misusing billions of dollars from customer accounts, with eight counts of fraud and election law violations against him.</p>
<p>As the CEO of FTX's sister concern Alameda Research, Caroline Ellison was a significant member of the SBF business empire. The New York Times has recently uncovered and reviewed her private Google docs, which have shed light on her mental state during the final months at FTX. The documents, previously unreported, reveal that she was going through a breakup with Sam Bankman-Fried and was plagued with self-doubt about her ability to lead Alameda Research effectively.</p>
A Star Witness Against SBF
<p>After the collapse of the FTX exchange, Ellison pleaded guilty to fraud charges and agreed to cooperate with authorities in building a case against Bankman-Fried. She is being considered a &ldquo;star witness&rdquo; primarily because of her close insight into the FTX ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Legal experts believe that Ellison's testimony could be the ace up the prosecution's sleeve in Bankman-Fried's trial. The power differential between Ellison and Bankman-Fried makes her a compelling voice, and her candid admissions could hold significant weight in the case against him.</p>
<p>Other FTX executives, like Nishad Singh and Gary Wang, have also pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate.</p>
Doubting Her Abilities As CEO
<p>The entries in Ellison's diaries revolve around her turbulent relationship with Bankman-Fried, the stress, anxiety, and how it affected her perception of Alameda and its work. She expressed feeling hurt and rejected during their toxic breakups, leading to a decreased excitement about Alameda, as it felt closely associated with him in a painful way. Moreover, she confessed to doubting her own abilities to justify her position at the company, feeling disadvantaged and unsure of her suitability for the role.</p>
SBF Lost Confidence In Alameda
<p>In April 2022, she wrote that a previous breakup with Bankman-Fried had significantly diminished her enthusiasm about Alameda. Court records show that during this time, Bankman-Fried invested over $400 million in Modulo Capital, a trading company led by someone he had previously dated, indicating his waning faith in Alameda Research. Ellison's writings revealed jealousy and resentment toward Modulo, as she felt sidelined.</p>
<p>Sam Bankman-Fried's trial is scheduled to begin in October in Manhattan. As the proceedings approach, all eyes are on Caroline Ellison and the potential impact of her testimony in bringing the accused founder to justice.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Will governments across the world inflict their CBDCs on their unsuspecting populations?</p>
Poor knowledge of CBDCs
<p>It was reported by Crypto Daily a year ago that 83% of respondents to a Crypto.com survey on digital currencies that was carried out by Economic Impact thought that &ldquo;greater international cooperation&rdquo; was needed in order to &ldquo;legitimise&rdquo; CBDCs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the questions asked in the survey was about the&rdquo;barriers to CBDC adoption&rdquo;. Here, only 27% of respondents said that a barrier was that they are &ldquo;not well understood&rdquo;.</p>
<p>However, probably the most concerning data that came out of the survey was the following:</p>

<p>&ldquo;More than nine in ten (93%) now say they agree that issuance of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) is necessary to establish a functioning market for new financial instruments such as digital bonds or other forms of digital assets,&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If one adds that executives were very &ldquo;pro CBDCs&rdquo; and that &ldquo;nearly 87% of all respondents strongly agreed that consumer demand for CBDCs has increased in their country&rdquo;, then a clearer picture emerges (if the survey is to be believed) that at least among the respondents at the time, the idea of a central bank digital currency was actually welcomed.</p>
Where is the government educational material on CBDCs?
<p>Therefore, the question has to be asked: Where are all the mainstream media articles or televised debates on the advantages or disadvantages of implementing CBDCs nationwide, or even as is being talked about by some international financial agencies - worldwide?</p>
<p>The most important change to the monetary system since Bretton Woods is already being implemented in several countries across the world, and is being developed in many others, and there is hardly a ripple of discussion in mainstream channels.</p>
CBDCs - a technology to cancel wealth
<p>Rick Rule, CEO of Rule Investment Media, and ex-president and CEO of Sprott U.S. Holdings, had the following to say on CBDCs in a YouTube interview with Mike Maloney:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The idea that your cash, your savings, exist as a licence from your government, is terrifying to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He added:</p>
<p>If you combine the idea of a technological cancellable currency, however it&rsquo;s held, with artificial intelligence and the Chinese technology around so-called social scoring or social credit, you come to a circumstance where your savings which are the result of the utility that you created in society can be cancelled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rick Rule went on to cite the recent example of how Trudeau&rsquo;s government had seized the bank accounts of Canadians who were supporting the truckers with donations. The seizures were illegal and without recourse to the courts. Rule&rsquo;s fear is that CBDCs would make this kind of action incredibly easy to implement.</p>
<p>Given the lack of any educational content from governments to citizens on the roll-out of CBDCs it would behove the citizens to make their own investigations into the matter. Time is of the essence.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Uniswap founder Hayden Adam&rsquo;s Twitter account suffered a breach, with hackers sending out several tweets leading users to scam websites and phishing links.</p>
<p>Crypto Twitter was quick to warn users of the hack and urged them not to click on any links tweeted by the compromised account.&nbsp;</p>
Back In Control&nbsp;
<p>Adams was able to regain control of his Twitter account a few hours after the attack was first reported. After regaining access to his account, Adams thanked the community for their assistance and warned others of the malicious links tweeted from the account. He also stated that he will share more updates soon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In control of my Twitter again. Appreciate everyone who helped out tonight and the effort people put in to help with takedowns, warnings, etc. Will follow up with updates when ready.&rdquo;</p>

Details Of The Hack&nbsp;
<p>The hack was first reported on the &ldquo;Web3 Security Alerts&rdquo; channel on Telegram, which notified its followers that the Twitter account belonging to the Uniswap founder was compromised. Hackers used the account to tweet that Uniswap&rsquo;s Permit2 contract was affected by an unknown exploit and user tokens were at risk. The tweet then encouraged users to click on a malicious link to secure their tokens. However, the scam tweet, the first of many, was online only for a few minutes before being removed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, after the first tweet, several more malicious tweets from the account were reported, with one tweet asking UniswapX users to check their eligibility to receive gifted $UNI tokens by clicking a link to a website hosted in Russia. A Twitter user was quick to notice that the website in question was registered on the day the hack had been orchestrated, suggesting considerable planning behind the entire episode. The official Uniswap Twitter handle was quick to step in, warning users of the hack and asking them not to click on any of the links, urging them to wait for updates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;@haydenzadamsTwitter account has been hacked. Please do not click on any links. There is no giveaway, airdrop, or bounty. The Protocol has not been hacked or exploited. We will let you know when the issue is resolved.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The hack did not impact the Uniswap protocol or any of its functions.&nbsp;</p>
An Age Old Problem&nbsp;
<p>Hackers have long been using social media platforms to exploit user accounts and seize control of their assets. Meta&rsquo;s new Twitter Rival, Threads, saw over 100 million sign-ups in days. However, hackers quickly appeared on the platform, promoting fake non-fungible token projects and impersonating prominent crypto personalities. However, social media organizations have taken notice of the growing menace and have taken steps to curb such attempts. On the 1st of July, Elon Musk announced that Twitter would be introducing a temporary limit on the number of posts users could read in a day as it looked to detect and eliminate bots and other bad actors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Security experts have also highlighted the importance of SIM card-based 2FA and also recommended options such as Authy or Google Authenticator to secure their accounts. Both platforms utilize time-sensitive codes on user devices, minimizing the risks of a hack occurring through SIM swaps.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Sam Altman-founded Worldcoin has completed its migration to the Optimism ecosystem, with critical components such as the World ID and World App technology stack already migrated to the OP mainnet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project announced the news on Twitter, adding that user migration is currently ongoing.&nbsp;</p>
A Significant Step&nbsp;
<p>The Worldcoin Foundation (Worldcoin&rsquo;s initial steward) and other early contributors, such as Tools for Humanity (Lead Software Contributor), had announced a collaboration with the Optimism Collective. As part of the partnership between the organizations, the World App and the World ID protocol would migrate from Polygon to the Optimism mainnet. Worldcoin Foundation and Tools for Humanity had stated at the time,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With more than 1.6 million sign-ups in beta and 500,000+ monthly active World App users, the deployments on OP Mainnet will expand access and help Worldcoin reach a values-aligned ecosystem of developers and users.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With the World App and World ID migration to Optimism complete, World App has now begun the process of user migration from Polygon to Optimism, intending to scale Web3 identity and governance on the Optimism Superchain. World App users and World ID holders will see a plethora of changes, such as the Worldcoin protocol migrating to Ethereum to support World ID. Additionally, a majority of Safe wallets have been deployed on the OP mainnet, with the remainder set to be deployed on user-initiated migration. Following the migration, World App also supports Uniswap on the OP mainnet.&nbsp;</p>
A Boost For Optimism&nbsp;
<p>Worldcoin believes that the migration of World ID to the OP mainnet could significantly boost the capabilities of Optimism&rsquo;s Citizen House. Citizen House works in tandem with the Token House to govern the larger Optimism Collective. World ID could also help enhance Optimism Collective&rsquo;s AttestationStation, a shared database designed to make the verification of information easier, and creates a strong network of trust on OP chains within the Superchain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>World ID SDK Publicly Available&nbsp;</p>
<p>Worldcoin has also made its World ID software development kit (SDK) publicly available to developers through a limited waitlist. Worldcoin&rsquo;s World ID software development kit has been critical in building over 100 projects, including flagship integrations such as Okta&rsquo;s Auth0 and Talent Protocol. The former is a global authentication and authorization platform, while the latter is a social and economic platform designed for Web3 builders based in Europe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The World ID software development kit includes a developer portal, web widget (JS), development simulator, and a comprehensive guide. Thanks to its permissionless architecture, it can support open identity standards and currently supports OAuth 2.0 and OIDC (OpenID Connect). There are plans to introduce support for Verifiable Credentials (VCs), Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), and Sign in with Ethereum (SIWE) in the near future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just last week, Worldcoin hit a significant milestone, registering 2 million World ID signups in its beta phase. The signups are an indication of World ID&rsquo;s global reach and appeal, with users registering from several cities, such as Buenos Aires, New York, Berlin, Barcelona, Tokyo, and Seoul.&nbsp;</p>
Optimism&rsquo;s Superchain
<p>Optimism&rsquo;s Superchain is a network of Layer 2 solutions that share security and communication layers. Worldcoin began its collaboration with Optimism almost a year ago when they jointly contributed to EIP-4844. This Ethereum improvement proposal looked to improve Ethereum&rsquo;s scalability beyond what was achievable with current Layer 2 networks. According to Worldcoin, EIP-4844 would reduce Layer 2 fees by a factor of 10. At the time, Worldcoin had noted,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;EIP-4844 is now expected to be included in the next hard fork of Ethereum. Its potential to accelerate adoption in the Optimism ecosystem could also enable a significant boost in World App transactions across Ethereum L2s with the World App wallet&rsquo;s migration to OP Mainnet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>World ID and World App&rsquo;s migration to the OP mainnet is the latest step in realizing Optimism&rsquo;s Superchain vision.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sam Altman-founded Worldcoin has completed its migration to the Optimism ecosystem, with critical components such as the World ID and World App technology stack already migrated to the OP mainnet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project announced the news on Twitter, adding that user migration is currently ongoing.&nbsp;</p>
A Significant Step&nbsp;
<p>The Worldcoin Foundation (Worldcoin&rsquo;s initial steward) and other early contributors, such as Tools for Humanity (Lead Software Contributor), had announced a collaboration with the Optimism Collective. As part of the partnership between the organizations, the World App and the World ID protocol would migrate from Polygon to the Optimism mainnet. Worldcoin Foundation and Tools for Humanity had stated at the time,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With more than 1.6 million sign-ups in beta and 500,000+ monthly active World App users, the deployments on OP Mainnet will expand access and help Worldcoin reach a values-aligned ecosystem of developers and users.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With the World App and World ID migration to Optimism complete, World App has now begun the process of user migration from Polygon to Optimism, intending to scale Web3 identity and governance on the Optimism Superchain. World App users and World ID holders will see a plethora of changes, such as the Worldcoin protocol migrating to Ethereum to support World ID. Additionally, a majority of Safe wallets have been deployed on the OP mainnet, with the remainder set to be deployed on user-initiated migration. Following the migration, World App also supports Uniswap on the OP mainnet.&nbsp;</p>
A Boost For Optimism&nbsp;
<p>Worldcoin believes that the migration of World ID to the OP mainnet could significantly boost the capabilities of Optimism&rsquo;s Citizen House. Citizen House works in tandem with the Token House to govern the larger Optimism Collective. World ID could also help enhance Optimism Collective&rsquo;s AttestationStation, a shared database designed to make the verification of information easier, and creates a strong network of trust on OP chains within the Superchain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>World ID SDK Publicly Available&nbsp;</p>
<p>Worldcoin has also made its World ID software development kit (SDK) publicly available to developers through a limited waitlist. Worldcoin&rsquo;s World ID software development kit has been critical in building over 100 projects, including flagship integrations such as Okta&rsquo;s Auth0 and Talent Protocol.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) possess immense potential to reshape the future landscape of the internet, ushering in a revolutionary approach to verifying our digital identities. The path to achieving this transformation remains ambiguous as we witness the emergence of Web3, a paradigm shift from platform-centric to user-centric networking. The crucial aspect of a user-centric network lies in users defining their identities and determining the information they wish to share with others.</p>
<p>After years of unwavering dedication, the MetaBlox team has released a breakthrough protocol that uses DIDs to provide a decentralized groundwork for creating a user-centric network. The team is diligently working to build the foundation for a web3 user-centric network that can support web3 native apps.</p>
<p>The MetaBlox Network mobile app represents a major step toward this lofty goal. With this software, users may take the first necessary step toward gaining access to a Free Privacy Protected WiFi Network by registering a DID and automatically uploading it to the blockchain and, in the process, earn mPoints that can be used on the further development of the network.</p>
<p>The platform has a lot of benefits that make it stand out. First and foremost, the team believes that the most compelling aspect of MetaBlox is that it is a user-centric network supported by a rewarding system for its users and builders. MetaBlox hopes to model itself after the prosperous Web 2.0 period, during which prominent corporations gave away their services for free to demonstrate the efficacy of their monetization schemes.</p>
<p>In Web 3.0, MetaBlox seeks to replicate this prosperity with a significant distinction. Instead of profits accruing solely to private entities, MetaBlox positions itself as a decentralized solution, enabling users and network maintainers to reap the rewards. Unlike the Helium Network, which employs LORA technology, MetaBlox operates as a WiFi Network, affording the bandwidth necessary to accommodate many users, thus substantially expanding monetization opportunities for all stakeholders involved.</p>
Powering the User-Oriented Web3: MetaBlox's OpenRoaming Initiative and Decentralized Connectivity
<p>MetaBlox's decentralized OpenRoaming WiFi Network made great strides toward creating a user-oriented Web3. Several major Web3 investment businesses and organizations contributed over $2 million to the initiative. The OpenRoaming Network expanded the worldwide WiFi network by deploying hundreds of MetaBlox Miners as blockchain nodes, allowing for secure, password-free, automated connections using Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs).</p>
<p>To create an OpenRoaming network with over a million access points, MetaBlox collaborated with the Wireless Broadband Alliance (WBA). The WBA Wireless Global Congress also saw a successful demonstration of their technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users may now create their own WiFi OpenRoaming profiles and have access to Web3 capabilities with the newly released software. Notably, MetaBlox teamed up with other initiatives such as Harmony, Caldance, Memolabs, and Deeper Network to accomplish its goals.&nbsp;</p>
MetaBlox Network's Blockchain Integration for DeFi, GameFi, and NFTs
<p>MetaBlox Network uses blockchain technology to improve the quality of its products and services significantly. Because of Blockchain technology, users' hotspot routers may double as crypto miners, earning them tokens in exchange for giving WiFi access. With this decentralized deployment approach, MetaBlox Network can steadily increase its worldwide presence and reach as an incentive for network development.</p>
<p>In addition, combining the MetaBlox Network with blockchain technology unleashes many novel possibilities. Decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, game finance (GameFi) ecosystems, and NFT markets may all be accessed confidentially and safely by users. Individuals may make money with digital assets by participating in farming and staking activities on DeFi networks. At the same time, the system provides unhindered entry to the increasing universe of GameFi and Play-to-Earn games, with strong security provided by blockchain-held credentials in place of the more archaic passwords.</p>
<p>MetaBlox Network was developed in response to the rapidly growing NFT sector, and it provides users with simple access to NFT markets and wallets by use of their DIDs. The firm has established its collection of utility-based NFTs, seen on major platforms like OpenSea, as evidence of its dedication to the blockchain ecosystem. MetaBlox Network aims to offer a genuinely user-centric experience that adapts to the new digital environment by integrating Web3, the Metaverse, 5G rollout, DeFi, and DID-based technologies.</p>
MetaBlox's $MBLX Token and Its Role in Decentralized Network Development
<p>MetaBlox is hard at work creating a user-focused, open, and free system for anyone who wants to use it. To encourage the development of a native Web3 network, which is in accordance with this goal, the $MBLX token has been introduced.</p>
<p>Businesses that want to sell goods or provide services inside the MetaBlox ecosystem are the primary target users of the $MBLX token. These companies actively contribute to developing decentralized ownership inside the next generation of wireless networks by earning and using $MBLX tokens.</p>
<p>The $MBLX token's main benefit over competing tokens is that it was made with Web3 users' insatiable curiosity about the platform's features in mind. These customers can take advantage of all the Web3 ecosystem offers once they adopt $MBLX.</p>
MetaBlox's Founding Members and Their Remarkable Technological Achievements
<p>The first MetaBlox team mostly comprises employees from the leading organizations that make up the alliance's founding members, which are located in North America and Asia. These businesses focus on developing and implementing state-of-the-art technologies, including blockchain, IoT, Telco, AI, and financial services. The alliance members range from large, publicly traded corporations to small, innovative startups, but they all have one thing in common: a desire to build a Web3 network that puts users' wants and needs first.</p>
<p>The founding coalition has made great progress and accomplished outstanding feats during the previous four years. They collaborated with the Canadian federal government on the first blockchain program, among other pioneering endeavors. Further distinguishing themselves, they were the first group to combine blockchain technology with eSIM and Bluetooth chips.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the alliance members are active contributors to the Decentralized ID Foundation. This shows their dedication to spreading the use of decentralized identification systems. WiGig is a broadband version of WiFi, and the alliance members are among the few businesses in the world that have access to this technology. Their proficiency with WiGig technology enables them to provide reliable and fast wireless network options.</p>
<p>Their work in the development of AI is another significant achievement of the original alliance members. They are pioneers in AI edge computing, having designed and produced one of the earliest system-on-a-chip (SOC) devices. This technological advancement provides high-performance and smart computing capabilities at the network's periphery, allowing for instantaneous data processing and analysis.</p>
<p>Members of the alliance have made significant investments in several high-profile initiatives throughout the decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming finance (GameFi), and non-fungible token (NFT) spaces, demonstrating their commitment to the development of these industries beyond just technological means. Investing in promising startups like 1inch and Axie Infinity demonstrates their dedication to fostering growth and development in the nascent blockchain industry.</p>
Final Thoughts
<p>The advent of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) has the potential to reshape the future of the internet by revolutionizing the way we verify our digital identities. As Web3 emerges, shifting from platform-centric to user-centric networking, the MetaBlox team has made remarkable progress in developing a protocol that leverages DIDs to establish a decentralized foundation for a user-centric network. Their commitment to building a web3 native network that supports user-centric applications is evident in the MetaBlox Network mobile app.</p>

<p class="s4">Auto Pool is set to provide the best user experience and capital efficiency for DeFi users, ultimately helping the protocol generate more liquidity. This is a largely untapped area in the DeFi market, and with Joe (JOE) pioneering this aspect, you can be sure its adoption would be massive. </p>
<p class="s4">Joe&rsquo;s (JOE) first offering, The General, will be launched soon, making the token&rsquo;s future growth worth keeping an eye on. </p>
Uwerx (WERX): Championing a New Era for Freelancers
<p class="s4">Like Joe (JOE) is doing in the world of DeFi, Uwerx is also set to revolutionize the freelancing industry, serving as a threat to the progression of existing freelancing platforms. </p>
<p class="s4">While &ldquo;threat&rdquo; may sound somewhat exaggerated, it is actually the reality, considering the multiple advantages Uwerx has over these existing platforms, especially the incredibly lower transaction commission. </p>
<p class="s4">Unlike Fiverr, which charges 20%, and Upwork, which charges 10% per transaction, Uwerx will only deduct a flat fee of 1% as commission, allowing freelancers to enjoy their money while fostering a healthy client-freelancer relationship. </p>
<p class="s4">Beyond their transaction fee, the Uwerx team has also unveiled the &ldquo;Uwerx Vault,&rdquo; a central hub where users can stake (store their token for as long as they want while getting rewarded for it). </p>
<p class="s4">SolidProof and InterFi Network have audited the platform to confirm its credibility and have also been listed by CoinSniper and awaiting Uniswap listing on Tuesday, August 1, 2023. The team has also promised to renounce all contracts and reduce taxes to zero before launching the project on centralized exchanges.</p>
<p class="s4">The Uwerx platform currently boasts 1,600+ subscribers on Telegram, 1,600+ Twitter followers, and 5,500 sign-ups on the platform. </p>
Uwerx (WERX) is Enjoying an Incredible Presale Run
<p class="s4">The WERX token is enjoying an unbelievable adoption rate, with the token&rsquo;s stage 1 to stage 4 presales getting completed in record time. Although currently at stage 5 of the presale at $0.041 per token with a 15% bonus.</p>
<p class="s4">Thanks to this high demand, the Uwerx team has modified WERX token allocations and will lock liquidity before all presales end on Monday, July 31, 2023. </p>
<p class="s4">In a more recent update, the team has also disclosed their plans to send tokens to holders immediately after the end of the presale in a 6-week vesting period. This vesting period will follow a defined vesting schedule: 8% on week 1, 10% on week 2, 14% on week 3, 18% on week 4, 22% on week 5, and 28% on week 6. Similarly, after the presale ends, they also plan to host a Test Airdrop, as voted by the community. </p>
<p class="s4">Beyond the Uwerx platform enjoying a brilliant presale run, the Uwerx team has also released the first version of the Alpha platform as a PDF while waiting to transition from Alpha into Beta in the coming weeks. The published PDF features ten (10) pages, including but not limited to the Sign in Page, Log In Page, Forgot Password Page, Hiring Dashboard Page, My Activity Page, Client or Freelancer Initiation Page, etc. </p>
<p class="s4">In a bid to create an inclusive community, the team has also created a dedicated feedback email, feedback@uwerx.network, to receive comments and suggestions about the published PDF pages. </p>
<p class="s4">Tokens in the fifth stage of the presale are currently available at a favorable price of $0.05245, accompanied by an appealing 15% bonus. This creates a highly advantageous opportunity for potential participants. However, it is important to be aware that the price will rise to $0.06294 on Tuesday, February 25th, 2023, at 18:00 UTC.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">In the face of legal turbulence surrounding its co-founder, Do Kwon, blockchain firm Terraform Labs has appointed a new CEO.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The change in leadership comes as Kwon, also Terraform Labs' principal shareholder, is under the threat of possible extradition to South Korea or the U.S. from Montenegro.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Steering Through the Storm</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Wall Street Journal reported that Terraform Labs has named U.S. citizen Chris Amani as its new CEO. Amani, who has been with Terraform since 2021, previously served as its chief operating officer and chief financial officer. Prior to his tenure at Terra, Amani held the CEO position at Humanity, a scheduling solution provider. His LinkedIn profile reveals that he took the reins as Terra's CEO in April 2023.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Despite the company's past focus on stablecoins, Amani stated that the firm will not launch any more of such offerings, instead concentrating on other products.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"We have a vision for how we could salvage this, even though I think it's going to be hard and it's going to take a long time," Amani said.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">He also expressed hope that Kwon would clear himself of all charges, while affirming that Terra will continue to operate in his absence.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Legal Quagmire and Market Impact</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Terra's collapse in May 2022 set off a domino effect that rattled the crypto market. The platform's stablecoin, TerraUSD (UST), lost its peg to the U.S. dollar, inciting investigations into Kwon and co-founder Daniel Shin's suspected involvement in illicit transactions during the collapse.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In March 2023, Kwon was arrested in Montenegro for allegedly using counterfeit travel documents. Although he received a four-month prison sentence, he also faces the prospect of extradition to either the U.S. or South Korea post-sentence. South Korean prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for Kwon in 2022, accusing him of violating the country's capital market laws. He was later released on bail.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Terraform's Legal Fight</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In an additional context, Terraform Labs is striving to subpoena bankrupt FTX for relevant documents to defend its case against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC had earlier sued Terraform Labs and former CEO Kwon, alleging fraudulent activities and market manipulation leading to the collapse of Terra/LUNA tokens.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The installation of a new CEO and the ongoing legal efforts highlight Terraform Labs' determination to steer its operations despite ongoing woes with its legal status.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Terraform Labs seeks the release of certain trading records from FTX to demonstrate that the destabilization of the Terra USD (UST) was triggered by a coordinated short attack by third parties. If the request is approved, the firm demands the immediate disclosure of these documents, given its trial's commencement by November 30.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Myanmar&rsquo;s National Unity Government (NUG), a shadow government opposing the current military rule, is set to launch a neobank operating on the Polygon blockchain network.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This development aims to disrupt the military-controlled financial system and fund efforts to regain civilian rule.</p>
Neobank Initiative
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The NUG's neobank, known as the Spring Development Bank (SDB), plans to offer currency swap, fixed deposits, and prize-linked savings account services via a web-based app, according to a spokesperson's statement at a recent virtual press conference. The bank aims to primarily cater to supporters of the ousted leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, including the Burmese diaspora. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">By using Uniswap v3 pools and USDT stablecoins, SDB will enable users to bypass the conventional financial infrastructure controlled by the State Administration Council (SAC), the military government. Donations made through SDB will directly contribute to the revolution effort and help with the reconstruction of post-revolution Myanmar.</p>
Raising Funds for Revolution
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Since the military coup in February 2021, which triggered various sanctions from governing bodies like the U.S. and the EU, the NUG has been devising innovative methods to raise funds to challenge the military junta. These initiatives include issuing revolutionary bonds and auctioning off properties held by military leaders. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The bank, solely owned by NUG&rsquo;s Ministry of Planning, Finance, and Investment, intends to offer shares to the public in two phases. An initial coin offering (ICO) round will exclusively serve SDB account holders, followed by another ICO round targeting institutional investors. The bank also plans to raise funds through remittances, currency exchanges, loans, and other financial products. In 2021, the NUG assigned Tether as its official currency.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The revolutionary government has since been recognized as the official government of Myanmar by members of the United Nations and the European Parliament, from October 2021 forward. It has been clear, however, that the U.S. has never officially disclosed any recognition of this matter.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Security Measures and User Goals</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Assuring compliance with Basel Accords and Financial Action Task Force (FATF) regulations, SDB will implement multiple layers of data and funds segregation. SDB aims to onboard 100,000 active users within six months.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Despite the challenges facing the NUG, the launch of SDB demonstrates how blockchain technology can be leveraged to challenge established systems and foster political change. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">In a recent keynote speech at the Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC), Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) partner Sriram Krishnan expressed confidence that Web3 has the potential to remedy the issues plaguing current Web2-based social media platforms. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Krishnan criticized the state of modern social media, calling it &ldquo;stuck in a different era,&rdquo; and urging that it was time for a change. He proposed the construction of "large-scale crypto consumer social media marketplace applications" as the way forward.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The a16z partner highlighted key flaws in current social media platforms: a restrictive follower system, limited application programming interface support, meager economic benefits for creators, and a lack of user and creator input in platform governance.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In contrast, Krishnan painted an optimistic picture of the potential that Web3 social platforms could offer, emphasizing the opportunities they present to underserved communities and high-status individuals whose voices are muted on other platforms.</p>
Social Platforms From Web3
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Krishnan also proposed an unconventional approach to developing these platforms: eschewing financial incentives at the outset. Instead of initially focusing on monetary rewards for creators, Krishnan suggested centering the early stages of a platform's life on fostering community and engagement.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">&ldquo;Social media dynamics are weird and complicated. These are complex human dynamics, and when you introduce money, I think it gets challenging to kind of map those dynamics," Krishnan claimed.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">According to the exec, prioritizing the monetary aspect can detract from the aim of community building and enjoyment.</p>
Handling Contradictions
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This doesn't mean the introduction of financial mechanisms should be completely foregone. According to Krishnan, once the platform has established its user base and community, creator economics and governance stakes can then be introduced. This incremental approach, he argues, could foster a more balanced and sustainable social media landscape.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">On the outset, Krishnan's views hold a promising potential not only for the reinvention of social media platforms but for the broader realization of Web3's inherent capabilities. Web3 technology, built on decentralized blockchain systems, offers a level of transparency and user control not feasible within the limitations of previous Web2 environments. These traits could lend themselves well to creating a social media ecosystem more responsive to user needs and desires.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In this sense, then, the potential economic benefits offered by Web3 platforms could foster a more equitable digital environment. This is particularly significant for creators, who currently receive a minimal share of the revenue generated by their content on traditional platforms. Web3 has the potential to rectify this imbalance, offering creators a larger piece of the economic pie. The caution(s) proposed by Krishnan, to delay the introduction of financial incentives, could help ensure that these economic benefits do not overshadow the vital elements of community and engagement.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Despite such a potential, Krishnan's vision of the future of social media is by no means assured, though it does provide a compelling blueprint for what could be possible. By harnessing the power of Web3, the next generation of social media platforms might not only resolve the issues inherent in existing platforms, but also open up new avenues for user engagement and creator remuneration.</p>

Instead of initially focusing on monetary rewards for creators, Krishnan suggested centering the early stages of a platform's life on fostering community and engagement.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">&ldquo;Social media dynamics are weird and complicated. These are complex human dynamics, and when you introduce money, I think it gets challenging to kind of map those dynamics," Krishnan claimed.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">According to the exec, prioritizing the monetary aspect can detract from the aim of community building and enjoyment.</p>
Handling Contradictions
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This doesn't mean the introduction of financial mechanisms should be completely foregone. According to Krishnan, once the platform has established its user base and community, creator economics and governance stakes can then be introduced. This incremental approach, he argues, could foster a more balanced and sustainable social media landscape.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">On the outset, Krishnan's views hold a promising potential not only for the reinvention of social media platforms but for the broader realization of Web3's inherent capabilities. Web3 technology, built on decentralized blockchain systems, offers a level of transparency and user control not feasible within the limitations of previous Web2 environments. These traits could lend themselves well to creating a social media ecosystem more responsive to user needs and desires.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In this sense, then, the potential economic benefits offered by Web3 platforms could foster a more equitable digital environment. This is particularly significant for creators, who currently receive a minimal share of the revenue generated by their content on traditional platforms. Web3 has the potential to rectify this imbalance, offering creators a larger piece of the economic pie. The caution(s) proposed by Krishnan, to delay the introduction of financial incentives, could help ensure that these economic benefits do not overshadow the vital elements of community and engagement.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Despite such a potential, Krishnan's vision of the future of social media is by no means assured, though it does provide a compelling blueprint for what could be possible. By harnessing the power of Web3, the next generation of social media platforms might not only resolve the issues inherent in existing platforms, but also open up new avenues for user engagement and creator remuneration.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Crypto influencer JefferyCrypt took to Twitter earlier today to share his hottest crypto picks for maximum gains in the next bull run. According to the influencer, XRP, Bitgert (BRISE) and Cardano (ADA) are likely to perform well in the near future and are poised for an upward movement in the dynamic and ever-evolving crypto space. </p>
<p>According to JefferyCrypt, Ripple&rsquo;s recent victory in the lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made XRP an attractive prospect for crypto investors. The influencer told his followers on Twitter that the court victory provided much-needed legal and regulatory clarity surrounding XRP and that it had restored investors' confidence in the cryptocurrency. </p>
<p>Data from CoinMarketCap showed that XRP was trading at $0.81 at the time of writing. The crypto has gained more than 70% since the summary judgment in SEC v Ripple. The online sentiment regarding XRP is divided, with some experts anticipating a further rally while others warned of a potential decline in case the SEC decides to appeal the court&rsquo;s ruling. </p>
The JefferyCrypt&rsquo;s second pick was Bitgert&rsquo;s native token BRISE. 
<p>According to the crypto influencer, Bitgert is a rising project in the blockchain space that offers innovative solutions and a fundamental value proposition. At the time of writing, BRISE was trading at $0.00000025, with a market capitalization of $102 million and a daily trading volume of $2.5 million. </p>
<p>JefferyCrypt&rsquo;s last pick was ADA, the native token of the Cardano blockchain. The influencer cited Cardano&rsquo;s advancements in blockchain research and peer-reviewed approach as the reason for including the token in his top altcoin picks. ADA is currently trading at $0.32, up 2.9% over the past 24 hours. </p>
<p>The influencer cited the summary judgment in Ripple v SEC as a major factor for his altcoin picks. According to him, the court ruling provided regulatory clarity regarding the security status of the above-mentioned tokens, which assured investors of their regulatory compliance. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>A bipartisan group of United States Senators has introduced the CANSEE Act to regulate DeFi platforms in order to curb money laundering and other financial transgressions.&nbsp;</p>
Senators Against DeFi
<p>U.S. Senators are taking a strong stance against money laundering and crypto-facilitated crime by introducing new legislation aimed at regulating decentralized finance (DeFi) services. The Crypto-Asset National Security Enhancement and Enforcement (CANSEE) Act requires DeFi platforms to comply with the same anti-money laundering (AML) and economic sanctions obligations as traditional financial companies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bipartisan team of senators behind the CANSEE Act includes Jack Reed (D-RI), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Mark Warner (D-VA), and Mitt Romney (R-UT).&nbsp;</p>
DeFi To Get More Centralized
<p>The CANSEE Act will introduce tighter regulations and laws to DeFi, on par with the governance experienced by centralized institutions like banks, securities brokers, casinos, and centralized crypto trading platforms. Consequently, DeFi services will have to establish AML programs, conduct due diligence on customers, and report suspicious transactions to the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).</p>
<p>Senator Warner noted,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe these focused measures will help maintain the robust AML and sanctions enforcement we need to protect our national security, while allowing participants who play by the rules to continue to take advantage of the potential of distributed ledger technologies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The legislation will also extend to all individuals and entities who facilitate the use of DeFi platforms by sanctioned individuals. The regulations under the act also will hold accountable any investor putting in more than $25 million in a DeFi project without a clear in charge.&nbsp;</p>
Crypto ATMs In Trouble
<p>The CANSEE Act is also extended its reach over crypto ATMs, claiming their higher propensity to be used in money laundering activities. As a result of the legislation, operators of crypto ATMs across the country will need to conduct identity checks for all participants involved in any single transaction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Senator Reed stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our bill will also ensure that law enforcement has access to better information about cryptocurrency transactions, which they need to fight crimes like cross-border drug trafficking, weapons proliferation, and ransomware attacks.&rdquo;</p>

Industry Criticizes DeFi Bill
<p>The bill has been highly condemned by crypto Twitter, with experts deeming it an "existential threat to DeFi.&rdquo; There have also been questions about the bill&rsquo;s imposition of control responsibilities, claiming it would discourage VCs from DeFi investments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Crypto Council for Innovation stated that the proposal lacks specific guidance on how decentralized protocols can comply with Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) reporting requirements. They advocate for an alternative approach that involves distinguishing elements within the DeFi technology stack and using blockchain transparency and programmability to establish compliance measures tailored to the crypto ecosystem.</p>

<p>Now projects of all calibers will have an environment to supercharge their social presence, bootstrap their communities, and bring their products to market with greater impact.</p>
<p>What is the ChainGPT Pad?</p>
<p>The ChainGPT Pad is an IDO platform and incubator for Web3 projects looking to bring their ideas to life and jumpstart their token ecosystems. As a means to uphold the standards of ChainGPT, the Pad conducts rigorous quality assurance tests and due diligence processes to vet incoming projects and is highly selective with who they allow to list.</p>
<p>The launchpad is coupled with the ChainGPT incubation program that provides a network of expert mentors (founders, venture capitalists, and CEOs of other successful projects) that provide support to all projects that meet a certain qualification criteria.</p>
<p>What are some of the Platform Features?</p>
<p>The ChainGPT Pad has been geared up with all of the leading innovations that contribute to successful, healthy, and effective IDO launches. Striking the perfect balance between opportunity and security the ChainGPT Pad has been carefully designed by a team of professionals with experience working on some of the industry's leading launchpads.</p>
<p>Two Round Structure&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every IDO is given two rounds for the audience to participate; starting at the guaranteed allocations for round 1 (where the upper tiers of the $CGPT community members are given exclusive access). In order to participate in the guaranteed allocation, qualifying members must register their interests (info on registration here). Moving into round 2, the FCFC (first-come-first-serve) invites members of all tiers and partners.&nbsp;</p>
Staking &amp; Point System
<p>Tithed to the $CGPT token ecosystem, the Chain GPT Pad has a simple and effective structure for establishing tiers. One $CGPT token is equal to one Point, point multipliers are based on the staking pool durations. An in-depth guide to the Staking and Point logic systems can be found here.</p>
Fair Tier System
<p></p>
<p>A model of prioritization and inclusion based on a balanced point module that leverages staking the $CGPT token to signal commitment. Composed of four distinct grade categories, Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Diamond, the tier system provides a structure for the discerning user that looks for maximal benefits. To explore the benefits of each tier and understand the detailed scope of inclusion, please refer to the official post here.</p>
Flexible Refund Policy
<p></p>
<p>As a means to provide the highest possible grade of protection to the participants of ChainGPT Pad&rsquo;s IDOs, a refund policy has been implemented that allows users up to 14 days of post-round considerations to finalize their commitments and lock in their allocations. More information about the refund policy can be found here.</p>
<p>For questions pertaining to how projects can register, how users can join, restrictions of countries, requirements to signal interest, and everything in between ChainGPT has provided a dedicated F.A.Q. for the Pad which can be accessed here.</p>
Upcoming IDOs on ChainGPT Pad
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Immediately upon launch, ChainGPT orchestrated a world-class lineup of three startups that have been going through the incubation program and have prepared to launch their IDOs in the months of July-August. With three projects already establishing their technical aptitude and social presence, here is who will be launching through the ChainGPT pad: DexCheck, TradeTomato, and Solidus AI Tech.</p>
What is DexCheck:
<p>DexCheck is an analytics platform augmenting the user experience with an AI-powered toolkit. From whale tracking and leaderboard monitoring to mirror trading and even arbitrage scanning, DexCheck is the future of on-chain intelligence.</p>
What is Tradetomato:
<p>Tradetomato is using artificial intelligence to fuel its decentralized trading platform and portfolio management ecosystem. Catering to a wide audience through modular trading algorithms, a social marketplace, unique wallet aggregators, and other elements from its stack of advanced tooling, Tradetomato is an end-to-end solution for the automation of on-chain finance.</p>
What is Solidus AI Tech:
<p>Providing AI infrastructure solutions for enterprises through its suite of SaaS, BaaS, AIaaS, AI marketplace, and HPC (high-performance computing), Solidus AI Tech is taking the Web3 industry by storm with its own 8,000-square-foot facility.&nbsp;</p>
What is the ChainGPT Incubation Program?
<p>Providing support, guidance, and accelerating excellence, the ChainGPT Incubation program is an extensive, in-depth, multi-month-long program of intense, close collaboration between ChainGPT and promising projects that are looking to launch into Web3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Revealed in May of 2023, the incubation program aims to attract teams of innovators who have identified unique pain points of the digital economy; and equip them with the knowledge, tools, and connections to realize their visions. You can find a dedicated blog post here that provides an overview of the rationale behind the Incubation programs and an introduction to the mentorship network.</p>
