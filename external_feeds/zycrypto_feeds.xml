<p>An ancient Bitcoin address that laid practically dominant for over a decade came back to life on Friday — transferring 279 Bitcoins worth $7.8 million to new wallets.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-another-dormant-bitcoin-whale-awakens"><strong>Another Dormant Bitcoin Whale Awakens</strong></h2>



<p>A Bitcoin whale that had not transacted in over 10 years suddenly came online today.</p>



<p>In October 2012 and May 2013, the wallet received some 1,128 Bitcoin ($31.6 million), <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1649387289745977344">according </a>to on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain. Back then, Bitcoin was worth $12 and $195, respectively. No coins went in or out of that wallet until today when the owner transferred $279 BTC worth approximately $7.8 million to three different addresses.</p>



<p>A decade ago when the wallet received its 1,128 bitcoin, investors may have had limited expectations about the price of the OG cryptocurrency and traded it as if it was chump change. At current prices, people who held onto the crypto basically became Bitcoin whales.</p>



<p>This latest transfer came just a day after another ancient wallet <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1648912229264416768">moved </a>2,071.5 BTC — worth $60.7 million — after lying dormant for over nine years. This particular whale acquired 6,071.5 BTC on Dec. 19, 2013, when Bitcoin’s price was around $663.</p>



<p>While sizable Bitcoin trades occur on a daily basis, it&#8217;s not often that coins that old see the light of day again. Some suggest that when old coins are being spent more often, it may indicate a shift in confidence to hold the crypto asset — often spurred by periods of market volatility.</p>



<p>Bitcoin continued its slump Friday for the third consecutive day, dropping 2.33% over the last 24 hours to just above $28,000 as traders seem to move away from risky assets. The top crypto has lost around 8.06% since last Friday. Bitcoin’s slide dragged the rest of the crypto market with it, with the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies dropping by 2.4% to $1.23 trillion, per CoinGecko data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All in all, one positive development for the crypto world on Thursday: the European Parliament <a href="https://zycrypto.com/industry-leaders-upbeat-as-eu-parliament-passes-much-anticipated-mica-regulation/">passed </a>the long-awaited MiCA crypto law, becoming the first major jurisdiction to do so.</p>

<p>In a landmark decision on Thursday, the European Union (EU) Parliament passed the EU Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, bringing the first-ever EU legislation for policing crypto assets one step closer to becoming law. The draft law was approved by a majority vote, with 529 votes in favour and 29 against.</p>



<p>The latest vote aimed to ensure that crypto transfers, like other financial operations, can always be traced and suspicious transactions blocked by introducing the so-called &#8220;travel rule.” The travel rule is a regulation by the Financial Action Task Force FATF that requires financial institutions to collect and share customer information during transactions to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. </p>



<p>As per the draft law, the travel rule will cover transactions above €1000 from self-hosted wallets when interacting with crypto-assets service providers. However, the rules will not apply to transactions conducted between individuals without the involvement of a service provider.</p>



<p>The draft law also supports market integrity and financial stability by supporting measures against market manipulation, money laundering and terrorist financing.</p>



<p>The legislators also approved the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to establish a public register for unauthorized crypto service providers in the EU to tackle money laundering. Also, crypto service providers, including miners, will have to disclose their energy use to reduce the carbon footprint of crypto-currencies when the draft is enforced.</p>



<p>Following the latest vote, industry leaders have been outpouring their support, even as the US continues to employ brute force tactics against the crypto industry.</p>



<p>“<em>While US regulators have been busy infighting and refusing to provide the most basic of clarity for the crypto industry, the European Union just approved the MiCA regulation, which provides a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto in Europe. It&#8217;s sad to see the US being left behind on such an important technology and its promise,”</em> Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of crypto exchange Gemini, tweeted on Friday.</p>



<p>Susan Friedman, head of Ripple&#8217;s public policy, also commented that the US risks falling back due to its obsession with ‘Enforcement instead of clarity’.</p>



<p><em>“The EU has taken a big leap forward with a sensible, progressive approach to crypto regulation. We look forward to building and growing in the European marketplace,”</em> she said.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, Coinbase CEO Ben Armstrong hinted at his exchange <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-ceo-is-considering-relocating-company-outside-of-the-u-s-due-to-unfavorable-regulation/">moving offshore</a>, lauding the UK for “moving fast on sensible crypto regulation.” In an April 19 blog, Nana Murugesan, VP of International and Business Development noted that while they would like to see the US take an approach similar to that of the UK, “<em>a regulation by enforcement approach in the US is instead leading to a disappointing trend for crypto development in the US.”</em></p>



<p>That said, the MiCA texts will now be forwarded to the council for formal endorsement before being published in the EU Official Journal, becoming effective after 20 days.</p>

<p>Bitcoin has been on a tear since the beginning of the year, recouping over half of the losses incurred during the 2021-2022 bear cycle.</p>



<p>Last week, the world’s most popular cryptocurrency rose as high as $30,900, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/another-bitcoin-indicator-hints-at-explosive-btc-price-growth/">tapping levels</a> seen in over 10 months and bringing a welcome relief for investors who had previously suffered significant losses. That strength was also reflected in other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, which has now reclaimed the $2,000 mark, partially fueled by the recently concluded Shanghai Harfork.</p>



<p>Notably, the global crypto market capitalization also recouped the $1 trillion market cap total of $1.18T at press time, as investors pumped money into various crypto assets hoping to make some profits. According to experts, this had been a further indication of an overall positive sentiment in the cryptocurrency market despite concerns around regulatory uncertainty that have roiled the crypto market in the past few months.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-careful-warns-santiment"><strong>Careful, Warns Santiment</strong></h2>



<p>Nevertheless, even as investors continue to pile investments into cryptocurrencies for <a href="https://zycrypto.com/galaxy-digitals-novogratz-on-why-bitcoin-could-hit-30k-before-the-end-of-march-amid-rising-fomo/">fear of missing out</a> (FOMO), on-chain analytics firm Santiment has warned that this could portend danger.</p>



<p>On April 4, the firm issued a warning about the current state of the market, noting that its had noticed several divergences that have led to a temporary pause in the growth of ETH.</p>



<p><em>“These divergences suggest that the market&#8217;s appetite for risk has been relatively low, with some participants anticipating a drop, while others were waiting for the break of 32k in BTC and 2k in ETH,”</em> the firm warned.</p>



<p>The firm further highlighted a similar pattern in the wealthy holder’s behaviour map, where whales have been seen reducing their BTC positions. It, however noted that the situation had begun to change following the Shanghai fork and Ether’s move above $2,000.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/LcYYz7rtiYKU6i5dM9OLXBYqH6BBZemUdki6gxQ1om1YqIaIN_9QVHCHUv3EaTK2Zf8fV7OliRO3Ua6mxXoAQ28qKyamEWppcgzSOiP-mSQ1XLHX5QYyeQG01omBLYfNwDqNQOJ-URUNdnsjRwk2zA" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Santiment then noted that the market may be heading towards a top as signs of FOMO, or fear of missing out, become more apparent. According to the firm, traders should be on the lookout for indicators such as a significant increase in retail accumulations, a decrease in stablecoin holdings, and a spike in general network activities- to discern a market top.</p>



<p>“<em>If these indicators are present, along with increased funding rates and a consensus among video (YouTube) &#8220;influencers&#8221; that this break represents a confirmed path towards new all-time highs (ATH), it may signal that we are approaching a market top,”</em> wrote the firm.</p>



<p>At press time, Bitcoin traded at $28,065 after a 2.81% decline in the past 24 hours. According to Gareth Soloway, president and chief market strategist at inthemoneystocks, the price needs to get above the $30,500 level “to really establish that a low is in on Bitcoin”.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Ether was trading at $1,920 after a 1.8% drop in the past day, as per CoinMarketCap.</p>

<ul>
<li>Crypto wireless network Helium has concluded its long-anticipated exodus to Solana, creating a mutually beneficial partnership. </li>



<li>As part of the move, 991,000 NFTs are being minted to represent each node running on the Helium network.</li>



<li>Each NFT will also serve as an authentication tool for all nodes, making them decentralized network credentials.</li>
</ul>



<p>Solana (SOL) is having a good year, with its price skyrocketing over 131% this year and is set to improve on its technical and network infrastructure.</p>



<p>Helium has successfully migrated to the Solana ecosystem from its own layer 1 blockchain in a move that will create new prosperous paths for both networks. The Helium community hailed the move as a catalyst to unlocking cheaper non-fungible tokens (NFT) mints while Solana could unlock additional use cases on the blockchain.</p>



<p>The move will see 991,000 new NFTs minted on Solana representing each physical hotspot node on Helium. Currently, over 150,000 NFTs have been minted, according to data from Flipside Crypto. Node operators will claim their NFTs when they login to their hotspot’s wallet.</p>



<p>This month, Solana <a href="https://solana.com/news/state-compression-compressed-nfts-solana">announced</a> a new State Compression feature which makes it easier to mint NFTs with little cost. According to the developers, the cost of minting a million NFTs stands at $113 worth of Solana, which is far less compared to Solana’s default NFT mining price.</p>



<p>Without the compressor, it cost about $253,000 worth of SOL to mint NFTs, $33.2 million worth of ETH on Ethereum, and $32,000 worth of MATIC on Polygon. The Helium Foundation has justified minting nearly 1 million NFTs representing each node, asserting that the tokens will serve as an added network credential to authenticate hotspots.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-perfect-start-to-q2">A perfect start to Q2</h2>



<p>This move mutually benefits both networks with increasing use cases, cheaper fees, and improved community participation. The move was initially approved in Sept 2022 after the community voted in favour of the migration. Deploying the ‘network of network’, which incentivizes users to share their wireless connection for rewards is key to Solana&#8217;s development.</p>



<p>Helium launched a 5G network to be used on smartphones, laptops, and other devices, which are already being marketed with Solana’s newly <a href="https://zycrypto.com/solana-smartphone-set-for-early-may-sales-here-are-its-exciting-features/">released</a> Saga phone. Plans are also in motion by Nova Labs, the developers of Helium, to release Helium Mobile Wireless Service in the United States in partnership with T-Mobile’s nationwide coverage. </p>



<p>This move will be huge for Solana as it looks to recover losses after struggling with network downtimes from technical issues last year. </p>

<p>Former Marine-turned-class-action lawyer John E. Deaton threw shade at SEC chairman Gary Gensler on Thursday, condemning his performance as a regulator.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gensler has previously been accused of forcing the digital assets industry into a regulatory framework that’s neither applicable nor compatible. Rather than providing the necessary clarity, the official has opted to send Wells Notices to several crypto-focused firms this year.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-i-look-forward-to-the-day-he-is-investigated"><strong>“I Look Forward To The Day He Is Investigated”</strong></h2>



<p>Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton has taken aim at Gary Gensler.</p>



<p>In a recent tweet, Deaton noted that the SEC chair should be investigated in the near future. His logic stems from the fact that Gensler has stepped up scrutiny of digital asset firms this year and declared all cryptocurrencies besides bitcoin fall under securities rules, all while deliberately failing to pursue “Chinese executives&#8217; crimes in US capital markets”, per a tweet that Deaton commented on.</p>



<p>The XRP amicus curiae posited that Gensler acts in the interest of a “select few”, suggesting he is an agent of Wall Street’s financial elite. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/GaryGensler?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@garygensler</a> you believe focused SEC enforcement on crypto and concealing (not pursuing) Chinese executives&#39; crimes in US capital markets is the best way to maintain US dollar position? 1/3  <a href="https://t.co/3q3cL6hn1k">https://t.co/3q3cL6hn1k</a>…<a href="https://twitter.com/mirandadevine?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@mirandadevine</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/LeeSmithDC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@LeeSmithDC</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Jkylebass?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Jkylebass</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/RepTimmons?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RepTimmons</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@JohnEDeaton1</a></p>&mdash; Brian Costello (@bpcostello) <a href="https://twitter.com/bpcostello/status/1648764092801499136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 19, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The original tweet authored by Brian Costello states that Gensler and his agency covered up “a multibillion-dollar Chinese criminal enterprise defrauding US investors”. During Costello’s interview with the FBI, one federal agent allegedly “believed there were significant offenses and inquired about SEC&#8217;s lack of response.”</p>



<p>According to Costello, these actions, coupled with the SEC’s furious attack on the fast-growing crypto ecosystem, are “accelerating the collapse of the dollar.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>SEC’s Tough Stance On Crypto</strong></h2>



<p>Following the quick and unexpected bankruptcy of mega crypto asset exchange FTX late last year, the SEC — under Gary Gensler — has quickly targeted prominent U.S. crypto brands.</p>



<p>Back in January, it <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-7">slapped </a>Genesis and Gemini with charges for offering unregistered securities. A month later, it <a href="https://zycrypto.com/secs-crackdown-on-krakens-staking-program-puts-other-players-on-notice/">fined </a>cryptocurrency exchange Kraken $30 million for breaking securities laws.</p>



<p>Then, last month, the Commission <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-action-against-coinbase-triggers-ballistic-reaction-from-crypto-community/">issued </a>a Wells Notice to Coinbase, the largest exchange in the U.S., claiming that its staking products constituted unregistered securities.</p>



<p>And in its latest enforcement action earlier this week, it <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2023/comp-pr2023-78.pdf">alleged </a>that Seattle-based exchange Bittrex simultaneously operated a national securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency in violation of federal securities law. The agency further claimed that major cryptocurrencies Dash, Algorand, OMG Network (OMG), and others bear characteristics of securities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These actions have some politicians — Republicans in particular — fuming, with some <a href="https://zycrypto.com/pro-crypto-congressman-mulls-pushing-legislation-to-remove-secs-gary-gensler/">proposing </a>legislation to boot Gensler from office.</p>

<p>Recently, the team behind “SHIB: The Metaverse” shared a range of developments made over the last few weeks on the project, thrilling the Shib-Army and signalling a bright future for the ecosystem’s future.</p>



<p>In an April 10<sup>th</sup> blog post, the team announced the launch of a new official Twitter account, noting that all official updates and communications on the metaverse will subsequently be made there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The team also highlighted the details of several new tools being developed to make the user experience on the metaverse “truly fantastic”. These tools include the Plot Builder, which will enable the creation and customization of plots, while the Avatar Builder will enable users to create a unique digital identity with a wide set of personalization options. The team also noted that they were working on a Game Maker tool, which will be discussed in a future blog.</p>



<p>As per the blog, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-devs-set-out-to-deliver-an-exceptional-product-as-shib-metaverse-is-finally-unveiled/">Shib The Metaverse</a> has also been revised to ensure users enjoy a more photorealistic experience. To achieve this, the team noted that it was building new Hubs from a new starting point using Unreal Engine 5.1, which shortens the workflow process and results in an impressive level of quality.</p>



<p>The latest update also revealed that Rocket Pond would be the next Hub to be unveiled, which the team promised will take users to new heights, literally and figuratively.</p>



<p>Last month, Shib The Metaverse was showcased at the SXSW Experience, an annual conference for creators in Texas, USA, where the project’s team gathered consumer feedback. The team&#8217;s presence at the event was centred around community building, increasing awareness of the SHIB -The Metaverse concept and establishing a feedback loop on the project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the team, by the end of 2023, users will be able to dabble with some areas of the Metaverse.</p>



<p><em>“While all development takes time, the MV team is confident that by the end of 2023, users will have the opportunity to explore some of the areas in this fantastic world, build, design, play, and develop within it.” </em>The blog read, adding, <em>“However, it should be noted that not all areas of the Metaverse will be fully completed as it is an ongoing project. The world will continuously evolve and develop, but there will be several optimized Hubs and all necessary tools for users to start building and creating.”</em></p>



<p>That said, the latest update on Shib’s metaverse is full of exciting developments that promise to provide users with endless possibilities and a possible run up to $0.001 SHIB price. It will thus be interesting to see how the project develops in the coming months, alongside other ecosystem updates such as <a href="https://zycrypto.com/0-001-shib-price-beckons-as-shiba-inus-shibarium-public-beta-finally-set-to-go-live-this-week/">Shibarium</a>.</p>

<p>Crypto-friendly Congressman Warren Davidson is considering a move to push legislation that would remove the current Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, from his position.</p>



<p>Davidson, a Republican from Ohio, announced his plans on April 16, stating that the move aims to correct what he calls a &#8220;long series of abuses&#8221; by the SEC. In his tweet, Davidson said he would introduce legislation to replace the Chairman with an Executive Director reporting directly to the agency’s board, where authority resides. He also noted that former Chairs of the SEC would be ineligible for the position.</p>



<p><em>“To correct a long series of abuses, I am introducing legislation that removes the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and replaces the role with an Executive Director that reports to the Board (where authority resides). Former Chairs of the SEC are ineligible,” </em>said Warren.</p>



<p>The lawmaker made the comments responding to a <a href="https://twitter.com/WarrenDavidson/status/1647572722958974983">tweet</a> from Paul Grewal, Chief Legal Officer of Coinbase, who hailed commissioner Hester Pierce for calling out the agency’s shortcomings with regard to regulating the crypto sector.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce spoke out against the agency&#8217;s aggressive push for regulations that could stifle innovation and harm the crypto industry.</p>



<p><em>“Today’s Commission treats its basic approach to exchange regulation as something that must not—indeed cannot—be altered to allow room for new technologies or for new ways of doing business,”</em> Pierce <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-rendering-inovation-2023-04-12">said</a> in an April 14 statement.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>“Today’s Commission tells entrepreneurs trying to do new things in our markets to come in and register. When entrepreneurs find they cannot, the Commission dismisses the possibility of making practical adjustments to our registration framework to help entrepreneurs register, and instead rewards their good faith with an enforcement action,” </em>she added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Piecer commented on the back of a push by the SEC to alter the definition of an exchange, a move that could potentially have big implications for crypto.</p>



<p>Davidson&#8217;s comments come amid growing concerns that the SEC, under the leadership of Chairman Gary Gensler, may be pushing for overly restrictive regulations that could discourage innovation and harm the crypto industry.</p>



<p>Following the downfall of FTX in November 2022, the SEC has been vigorously targeting cryptocurrency firms under the guidance of Chairman Gary Gensler, with the so-called “<a href="https://zycrypto.com/fdic-gives-signature-banks-crypto-clients-a-week-to-shut-down-their-accounts/">Operation Choke Point 2.0”</a> becoming more apparent. On that note, crypto adherents have vowed to fight back, criticizing the SEC&#8217;s handling of crypto-related issues and calling for greater regulatory clarity for the industry. </p>



<p>That said, whereas the move to remove Gensler from his position is likely to face opposition from Democrats, who control both houses of Congress, it remains to be seen whether Davidson&#8217;s proposal will gain traction, considering the industry’s growing resistance against SEC’s attempts to expand its remit.</p>

<p>After a relatively strong quarter, Cardano (ADA) has continued to signal explosive growth thanks to impressive fundamentals over the past quarter. </p>



<p>Last week, the 7th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization managed to close above a key psychological resistance zone that could embolden bulls for the better part of the remaining year. Generally, ADA has surged over 70% since tapping a low of $0.25 last December, making it one of the largest gainers in the top 10 coins by market cap year-to-date.</p>



<p>Whereas Cardano’s remarkable recovery can be attributed to an overall crypto market sentiment improvement, the network’s ecosystem has been booming with activities, boosting its overall <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-primed-for-massive-boom-as-ada-whales-network-activity-heats-up/">attractiveness to whales</a>.</p>



<p>According to a Tuesday report by crypto research firm Messari, one of the biggest drivers to the rise in ADA’s market cap has been the significant increase in its Total Value Locked (TVL), which grew 172% from last quarter to $138.3 million.</p>



<p>Protocols building atop Cardano, such as MinSwap and Liqwid Finance, have been key contributors to this growth, as more users onboard to leverage Cardano’s wealth of use cases. This growth has further fuelled ADA’s market capitalization expansion from $8.6 billion in the last quarter of 2022 to $13.2 billion by March 31. At the time of writing, that figure had risen to just over $14.5B.</p>



<p>As per the report, stablecoins have also played a significant role in the overall growth of Cardano&#8217;s ecosystem. The introduction of new stablecoins on the network, such as Indigo&#8217;s IUSD, Djed&#8217;s DJED and RUSD, drove total stablecoin value up by 261% in the past quarter, meaning their overall volume grew even faster than ADA’s overall TVL did. This surge in stablecoin adoption suggests that the Cardano platform can accommodate other digital assets beyond just the ADA token.</p>



<p>One of the most significant developments for Cardano in recent months has been the opening of the first <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-poised-for-ultra-bullish-surge-following-latest-hydra-upgrade-development-milestone/">Hydra Head</a> on the mainnet. This development is expected to significantly improve the platform&#8217;s scalability and attract more developers to build decentralized applications on Cardano.</p>



<p>In addition to the opening of the Hydra Head, Milkomeda C1, Cardano developers IOG continue to work towards new use cases in the greater Cardano ecosystem and increasing interoperability through projects such as EVM proof-of-concept sidechain, Wanchain, and Midnight. These efforts are crucial for expanding the use cases for ADA and attracting more users to the platform.</p>



<p>That said, Cardano&#8217;s impressive fundamentals and recent developments suggest that the platform is well-positioned for future success, with the $1 price milestone on the horizon.</p>



<p>At press time, ADA was trading at $0.41, down 4.80% in the past 24 hours, after retesting the yearly support of $0.40 early Wednesday. </p>

<p>4/20 is widely known in the United States as the day when marijuana lovers celebrate their love for the intoxicating plant by smoking it. It is also dubbed “Dogeday”, a significant date for the Shiba Inu-themed token. As the day nears, the DOGE Army is holding out for a potential meteoric surge for the leading meme-centric cryptocurrency.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-memey-dogeday"><strong>Memey Dogeday</strong></h2>



<p>There is no denying the fact that Dogecoin is one of the most polarizing cryptocurrency projects in the market today. On the one hand, most believe the meme token is largely a joke that has long overstayed its welcome; however, there are also fans — including a string of celebrities and business moguls — who are fairly confident it’s a legit financial instrument that will stick around for the foreseeable future.</p>



<p>The prices of the nine-year-old cryptocurrency have swung up and down in recent weeks — mostly thanks to its de facto master, Elon Musk.</p>



<p>The eccentric billionaire has long loved Dogecoin. Earlier this month, DOGE <a href="https://zycrypto.com/dogecoin-soars-over-25-after-elon-musk-replaces-twitters-logo-with-shiba-inu-image/">rocketed over 25%</a> after Musk’s Twitter replaced the social media website’s familiar blue bird logo with the token’s dog. The logo disappeared from Twitter’s platform, and the coin plummeted sharply again.</p>



<p>Now, Dogecoin enthusiasts are optimistic that the imminent Dogeday will light a fire under the bulls, thus igniting a fresh parabolic rally after the disappointing Twitter logo change fallout.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Where Is DOGE Heading?</strong></h2>



<p>Musk has previously <a href="https://zycrypto.com/dogecoiners-cheer-as-elon-musk-charts-a-bullish-course-for-twitter-crypto-payments/">revealed </a>that he wanted to integrate crypto payments into Twitter — and even hinted that DOGE would be the microblogging platform’s currency. However, no solid plans along these lines have been announced yet.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, many pro-Dogecoiners are rooting for the price of the token to reach the ultimate price point of $1, perhaps driven by sentiment on social media and massive DOGE buys.</p>



<p>Dogecoin, the eighth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is plunging in value today as <a href="https://zycrypto.com/long-traders-feel-the-pain-as-bitcoins-dramatic-fall-to-29000-leads-to-241-million-liquidations/">Bitcoin slips below</a> the psychologically important $30,000 level in a sudden sell-off. DOGE was down 5.3% at the time of publication, trading hands for $0.088004, according to CoinGecko.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="647" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-4-1024x647.png" alt="" class="wp-image-79923" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-4-1024x647.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-4-300x190.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-4-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-4-1536x971.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-4-2048x1294.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">DOGEUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/DOGEUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Whether the upcoming Dogeday helps the token regain upward momentum or turns out to be a nothing-burger remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Bitcoin suddenly reversed course on Wednesday, with the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/another-bitcoin-indicator-hints-at-explosive-btc-price-growth/">BTC price</a> tanking to as low as $29,014 in the span of a few hours. Futures traders betting on a continued uptrend of crypto prices racked up over $241 million in losses to liquidations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Long Liquidations Top $241 Million</strong></h2>



<p>Bitcoin dived by around 3.6% to just over $29K on April 19, reaching levels not seen since April 10.</p>



<p>Similarly, the total market capitalization of all cryptos fell by circa 3.4% over the past 24 hours to $1.28 trillion, according to CoinGecko. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, also lost its $2,000 crucial support level and is currently down 6.2% in the last 24 hours, changing hands at $1,984.62.</p>



<p>“Deep correction on the markets, as Bitcoin can’t hold at $29,700-29,800 and shoots downwards through a cascade of liquidations,“ crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1648602887855955968">observed</a>.</p>



<p>Specifically, the abrupt price retracement caused a total of $241.37M in liquidations across the cryptocurrency market, <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData">data </a>from Coinglass shows. Of the liquidated trading positions over the last 24 hours, the majority were longs, betting on higher prices. Ether (ETH) traders suffered the most losses, some $59.03 million, while Bitcoin (BTC) liquidations surpassed $47.51 million.</p>



<p>Traders on Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, saw $5.75 million of losses, followed by $3.11 million of losses on OKX, and $2.30 million on Bybit, per CoinGlass. Binance also saw the highest liquidated value, with a single $3.02 million Bitcoin position getting closed on the exchange.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-triggered-the-sudden-bitcoin-price-drop"><strong>What Triggered The Sudden Bitcoin Price Drop?</strong></h2>



<p>While there were no direct catalysts to explain the meltdown, the bitcoin price drop comes as global equity markets slipped after the Bank of England and the European Central Bank said they were considering hiking interest rates further to bring inflation under target rates. The U.S. Federal Reserve has also recently hinted at another rate increase in the upcoming May policy rate meeting.</p>



<p>Following the sharp decline in the bitcoin price today, traders have become more cautious about the market&#8217;s short-term trend. Others, like trader Crypto Kaleo, however, <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoKaleo/status/1648600930869280772">called </a>the correction “beautiful” while reminding his followers that “dips are gifts”.</p>

<p>Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange based in the United States, is contemplating moving overseas should the U.S. fail to level the playing field with an unambiguous regulatory framework.</p>



<p>If Coinbase — and other crypto companies — leave because of the stifling regulations, the U.S. is bound to lose a fast-growing industry.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-leaving-the-united-states"><strong>Leaving The United States</strong></h2>



<p>Coinbase chief Brian Armstrong has hinted at an overseas move.</p>



<p>Speaking at the Fintech Week in London, Armstrong said “Anything is on the table including relocating or whatever is necessary&#8221;, when asked by ex-U.K. Chancellor George Osbourne whether Coinbase could consider moving its headquarters away from the U.S.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Armstrong, who is embroiled in a possible lawsuit with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), says that the U.S. has the potential to be a key market for crypto but the regulatory environment is quite murky. &#8220;I think in a number of years, if we don&#8217;t see that regulatory clarity emerges in the U.S., we may have to consider investing more elsewhere in the world,” the Coinbase boss added.</p>



<p>Armstrong also commented on the perks of the U.K.’s clearer regulatory framework, given there is only one primary body, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which oversees both securities and commodities, unlike in the U.S. where the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the SEC are “having a turf battle”.</p>



<p>The crypto exec further noted that both the heads of the CFTC and the SEC oftentimes make contradictory remarks, underscoring the need for a clear rulebook.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Crypto Clampdown In The U.S.</strong></h2>



<p>Brian Armstrong’s threat to move overseas comes amid a vigorous crackdown on the crypto sector in the States.</p>



<p>Just yesterday, the SEC <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-78">filed charges</a> against Seattle-based crypto exchange Bittrex and its co-founder William Shihara for operating as an unregistered securities platform and deliberately evading regulatory scrutiny. Before that, Coinbase was <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-action-against-coinbase-triggers-ballistic-reaction-from-crypto-community/">hit </a>with a Wells Notice for potential securities violations, which typically precedes an enforcement action.</p>



<p>And in February, Kraken reached a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/secs-crackdown-on-krakens-staking-program-puts-other-players-on-notice/">$30 million settlement</a> with the SEC that required it to stop offering staking services to U.S. customers.</p>

<p>Since launching its liquidity hub last week, Ripple has been making waves in the cryptocurrency world due to the omission of its native cryptocurrency in the product.</p>



<p>The blockchain company <a href="https://zycrypto.com/as-ripple-vs-sec-verdict-nears-1-xrp-price-looks-nigh-following-launch-of-ripples-liquidity-hub/">launched</a> its liquidity hub for businesses to bridge the gap between cryptocurrencies and fiat, mentioning BTC, ETH, LTC, ETC, USDC and BCH as part of the pilot program and leaving out XRP, ZyCrypto reported.</p>



<p>The omission surprised many and drew criticism from the community, forcing Ripple&#8217;s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, to explain the odd situation. In a thread of tweets Monday, Alderoty clarified that the Liquidity Hub is an enterprise product aimed at institutional customers rather than retail investors.</p>



<p>“<em>LH was built to access all kinds of crypto liquidity, not just XRP. Our target LH customers &#8211; today mainly institutions in the US &#8211; want access to a variety of tokens like BTC, ETH, and stablecoins. We’re here to serve customer demands,”</em> said Alderoty. He said Ripple&#8217;s product team has been clear about this from the outset.</p>



<p>Despite XRP&#8217;s popularity among retail investors, Alderoty further explained that there is little liquidity for XRP in the US. As such, he noted that they were keen to support XRP in the Liquidity Hub when they could provide a good customer experience. This suggests that Ripple is not opposed to including XRP in the Liquidity Hub in the future. Still, it needs to ensure that doing so provides value to its institutional customers.</p>



<p>Additionally, the lawyer pointed XRP&#8217;s absence from the Liquidity Hub to the lack of regulatory clarity in the US.</p>



<p><em>“XRP does not have regulatory clarity in the US, which is, of course, important to enterprise customers,”</em> he added.</p>



<p>XRP&#8217;s regulatory status has been a significant challenge in the US, which is why Ripple is unable to promote its use in their latest product. Notably, Ripple is still embroiled in a high-stakes lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-john-deaton-highlights-4-likely-outcomes-in-ripple-vs-sec-suit-as-case-takes-surprising-turn/">whose outcome</a> is expected to provide more clarity on the legal status of cryptocurrencies, informing potential regulations for the industry.</p>



<p>However, as Alderoty clarified, Ripple is not opposed to supporting XRP in the Liquidity Hub in the future, provided it can provide a good customer experience and regulatory clarity.</p>



<p>That said, it&#8217;s worth noting that Ripple&#8217;s sales of XRP, which are reported every quarter, are all to On-Demand-Liquidity (ODL) customers for use in the product, which is thriving globally. This suggests that despite XRP&#8217;s regulatory challenges in the US, it continues to enjoy strong demand elsewhere in the world, according to Alderoty.</p>

<ul>
<li>ETH surges over 10% post-Shanghai update, breaking past $2,100 for the first time in 11 months.</li>



<li>A little over 1 million ETH worth $2.1 billion has been withdrawn from Ethereum’s Beacon Chain within five days of the Shanghai update.&nbsp;</li>



<li>How high can Shanghai push ETH? The ETH community is split down the middle as many believe other factors will determine the asset&#8217;s overall performance this quarter.</li>
</ul>



<p>All eyes are now fixed on Ethereum (ETH) after the Shanghai upgrade, allowing validators to withdraw their staked assets from the network for the first time since the Merge.</p>



<p>ETH has continued to soar against all odds, with its price reaching a new milestone this year. ETH trades above $2,100 for the first time in 11 months after going on a nosedive last year following broader economic factors.</p>



<p>Trading over $2,100, ETH has gained over 10% in the last five days since the Shanghai <a href="https://zycrypto.com/post-shanghai-eth-makes-price-gain-institutional-investors-expected-to-flood-in/">update</a>. ETH recorded a good run in Q1 2023 and has started Q2 with similar strength. Recovering from the turmoil of last year, the leading altcoin has spiked 74.28% year to date (YTD) but is still 30% down from its position a12 months ago.</p>



<p>While the rise is surprising to many who thought the withdrawal of staked ETH would lead to a loss in value, others saw a potential spark with the new development. CEO of blockchain development firm Labrys, Lachlan Feeney, views the surge as happening because validators are re-staking their ETH almost immediately after withdrawals.</p>



<p>“<em>Much of the stake that has been withdrawn over the last few days is actually going straight back into The Beacon Chain as validators are looking to compound their interest. So much so that net stake is currently increasing,” </em>he added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Feeney also stated that the amount of staked ETH will increase as investors feel safer in the wake of Shapella.</p>



<p>“<em>Because Shapella is a massive de-risking event, over the medium to long term more, not less, ETH will be staked. We anticipate that in the not too distant future, we will reach a record high of Ether being staked.”</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-than-1-million-eth-withdrawn"><strong>More than 1 million ETH withdrawn</strong></h2>



<p>After the Ethereum Merge, which saw the blockchain transition to a proof-of-stake network last year, validators began staking to process transactions and have locked over 18 million ETH. In the past five days post-Shapella, 1.03 million ETH worth $2.1 billion has been withdrawn from 473,000 requests, according to data from Beaconcha.in.</p>



<p>Although it can be seen that validators are re-staking their assets, all ETH withdrawn from Kraken’s U.S. platform are exempted following a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>



<p>Before Shapella, on-chain intelligence firm Glassnode estimated 170,000 to be withdrawn in the first week of the upgrade. The number of withdrawals has long exceeded the mark drawing up many speculations.</p>

<p>Bitcoin could be in for a massive bull run ahead of the next halving event. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has already provided exceptional returns in 2023, with approximately an 80% climb year-to-date. At press time, the crypto asset was trading at $29,495, down over 2.71% in the past seven days.</p>



<p>The Bitcoin halving -also known as &#8220;the halvening&#8221;- is an event that cuts the rate at which new bitcoins are released into circulation in half. The rewards system is expected to continue until 2140 when the last bitcoin will be mined. Halvening attracts a lot of attention with the expectation that the decreasing number of new Bitcoins in circulation should theoretically drive up demand, leading to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-halving-epoch-scale-primed-to-send-price-20x-higher-in-long-term/">price increases</a>.</p>



<p>The last Bitcoin halving occurred on May 11, 2020, which saw the number of Bitcoin entering circulation drop from 12.5 per block to 6.25 per block. Halvening occurs approximately every four years, with the next halving likely to happen around April 2024.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-to-expect"><strong>What To Expect</strong></h2>



<p>According to popular crypto analyst “Ali,” we can gain insights into how BTC prices will behave in the future “by examining the fees-to-rewards ratio as well as the cryptocurrency’s historical accumulation or distribution cycles.”</p>



<p>The fees-to-rewards ratio is crucial to the Bitcoin network&#8217;s financial health. As block rewards decrease due to halving events, transaction fees become a critical income source for miners.</p>



<p><em>“Higher ratio signals a healthy &amp; sustainable network, boosting investor confidence &amp; demand, and driving the price of BTC higher. Conversely, a lower ratio might raise concerns about long-term sustainability, affecting the price of BTC negatively,”</em> Ali explained in an April 12 tweet.</p>



<p>Notably, the shift from accumulation to distribution can be predicted by the fees to reward on-chain data, which is currently spiking.</p>

<p>The Pundit further noted that the indicator suggests that the market has entered another accumulation cycle, similar to 2019 and 2020, prepping it for a further climb.</p>



<p>“<em>This indicates a potential price rally leading up to the 2024 Bitcoin halving,”</em> added Ali.</p>



<p>Timo Oinonen, an onchain analyst with Cryptoquant, also agreed with Ali’s assertions adding that both the fees to reward indicator and the 2019-based price model suggest Bitcoin will reach $46,092 by summer 2023.</p>



<p><em>“After reaching the 2019-based target price of 46,092 dollars, it&#8217;s easy to see Bitcoin </em><a href="https://zycrypto.com/crypto-pundit-reveals-why-100000-btc-price-is-possible-for-bitcoin-to-attain-in-2024/"><em>reaching $100,000</em></a><em> in the aftermath of the 2024 halving event,”</em> he wrote.</p>



<p>That said, while the fees-to-rewards ratio is a crucial factor in predicting the effects of the halving on Bitcoins price, other factors, such as market sentiment, macroeconomic conditions, and regulatory developments, could also play significant roles in determining the price of BTC.</p>
