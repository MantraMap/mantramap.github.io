<ul><li>Sam Bankman-Fried will be released on a whopping $250 million pre-trial bail.&nbsp;</li><li>The former FTX CEO will move in with his parents in California.&nbsp;</li><li>Alameda Chief Caroline Ellison has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with law enforcement.&nbsp;</li><li>SBF previously claimed that he was down to his last $100,000.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried, the former chief of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, is set to walk free following his&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-approved-extradition/" rel="noreferrer noopener">extradition</a>&nbsp;to the United States. A federal magistrate judge in New York has ruled that the disgraced CEO is to be released on a $250 million bail designed by federal prosecutors and SBF’s attorneys. Nicholas Roos, the prosecutor, in this case, has described it as the “largest pre-trial bond ever”.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Sam Bankman-Fried released into the custody of his parents</strong></h2>



<p>Per a report by&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/ftx-founder-bankman-fried-make-us-court-appearance-after-extradition-2022-12-22/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reuters</a>, Judge Gabriel Gorenstein has set strict terms for the release. SBF will be released into the custody of his parents, who are reportedly putting up the equity in their home to partially satisfy the bail conditions. Additionally, he will also be required to surrender his passport and undergo regular mental health treatment and evaluation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Users on Twitter were infuriated with the judge’s ruling. Despite his parents putting up the equity in their $25 million California house, the general sentiment was that Sam Bankman-Fried would use customer funds to fund his bail. The former FTX CEO had previously stated that he was down to his last $100,000.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Caroline Ellison joins hands with prosecutors</strong></h2>



<p>Caroline Ellison, the former Chief Executive of SBF’s quantitative trading firm Alameda Research, has secured a plea deal with the prosecutors. According to a press release put out by the U.S. Department of Justice, Ellison, along with FTX co-founder Gary Wang, plead guilty to the fraud charges brought by the DOJ.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to an unsealed&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23495436/crypto-cooperator-ftx-alamedas-caroline-ellisons-plea-agreement-inner-city-press-on-the-case.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">plea agreement</a>&nbsp;with the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Ellison will have to post a $250,000 personal recognizance bond. Terms of the agreement also include the clearing of any charges against Caroline Ellison except criminal tax violations, provided she fully cooperates with the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s office.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Sources said Sam Bankman-Fried could arrive in the U.S. as early as Wednesday afternoon.</li><li>Bankman-Fried was approved for extradition to face eight counts of criminal charges for fraud in FTX&#8217;s crash.</li><li>SBF waives his right to contest U.S. extradition after spending a week at the Bahamas Fox Hill prison. </li></ul>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried will be extradited to the United States to stand trial on fraud and money laundering charges over FTX’s crash, per reports from the New York Times and Wall Street Journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bankman-Fried could be arraigned in a Manhattan Federal District Court as early as Wednesday afternoon, NYT said. SBF was held at the Bahamas Fox Hill prison after his arrest earlier in December. However, no official timeline was disclosed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bankman-Fried was held in custody ahead of an extradition hearing after a judge <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-us-extradition/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-us-extradition/" rel="noreferrer noopener">denied</a> his bail request. SBF seemingly planned to contest U.S. extradition pending a review of the Justice Department’s criminal indictment. Prosecutors from the Southern District of New York charged Bankman-Fried on eight counts including fraud and campaign finance violations. </p>



<p>The FTX founder <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sam-bankman-fried-expected-back-in-bahamas-court-11671581149?mod=e2tw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">waived</a> his right to contest extradition during a hearing on Wednesday. SBF’s counsel Jerone Roberts submitted an affidavit with the decision and Bankman-Fried affirmed to the court saying “Yes, I do wish to waive my right to formal extradition proceedings.”</p>



<h2>Sam Bankman-Fried To Stand Trial For Fraud</h2>



<p>U.S. Attorneys charged Bankman-Fried with fraud over the collapse of FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange comingled with trading giant Alameda research, another piece of SBF’s crippled crypto empire.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prosecutors also accused the FTX Founder of violating campaign finance laws. Bankman-Fried reportedly donated tens of millions to bipartisan U.S. lawmakers. The CFTC and <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-fraud-ftx-customers/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-fraud-ftx-customers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEC</a> also charged SBF with defrauding customers, lenders, and investors. </p>



<p>In short, Sam Bankman-Fried stands accused of stealing customers&#8217; assets on FTX to finance Alameda’s debts and trading capital. The charges argue that Bankman-Fried also instructed FTX employees to mask Alameda’s billions in liabilities on the crypto exchanges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bankruptcy CEO John Ray testified to congress that FTX crashed due to a lack of corporate controls and risk management at the company. SBF admitted to loose control at the FTX but denied any criminal liability or intent</p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>Wintermute Founder Evgeny Gaevoy suggested that his crypto maker might move to fill in the created by FTX&#8217;s collapse.</li><li>Gaevoy and CEO Marina Gurevich said the company was considering rolling out a derivatives exchange built for professional traders, similar to FTX but with a few changes.</li><li>Gaevoy suggested segregated customer funds and third-party asset custody as some solutions to prevent another crash.</li></ul>



<p>Wintermute Founder Evgeny Gaevoy might launch a crypto exchange to cater to professional traders after FTX’s collapse in November left a void in the financial derivatives market, Forbes reported.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FTX rose to prominence partly due to Sam Bankman-Fried positioning the platform as a derivates exchange “built for traders by traders’. The angle propelled FTX towards crypto stardom, growing into one of the largest crypto trading venues with billions in transactions before SBF filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on November 11. </p>



<h2>Gaevoy&#8217;s Derivatives Exchange Plans</h2>



<p>Gaevoy along with Wintermute CEO Marina Gurevich pointed to the intensified workload following FTX’s crash as the company moves to capture market share and fill the boots of Sam Bankman-Fried’s exchanges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gaevoy <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2022/12/20/with-sam-bankman-frieds-hedge-fund-gone-crypto-trading-firm-wintermute-emerges/?sh=5ee639ed2bbb" rel="noopener">shared</a> thoughts on running a financial derivatives exchange with standard financial controls and risk management. According to FTX bankruptcy CEO John Ray, the crypto exchange <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-alameda-liabilities-korean-account/">imploded</a> largely due to a lack of risk management and corporate accounting practices,</p>



<p>Founder Gaevoy proposed segregating customer funds from company liquidity as part of an improved system for storing user deposits. Regarding asset custody, the veteran crypto trader said he would adopt a trading architecture similar to traditional financial exchanges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This means Gaevoy is a proponent of leveraging outside entities and third-party service providers to custody assets, as opposed to dedicating resources towards building in-house crypto asset custody solutions.

<ul><li>Uniswap users can now purchase crypto using their credit and debit cards.</li><li>Crypto purchases through fiat will be available on Ethereum mainnet, Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum.</li><li>The service will be provided with no minimum fees and zero spreads on USDC purchases.&nbsp;</li><li>The protocol is working on an option to convert crypto to fiat to send into bank accounts.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/uniswap-nft-trading-airdrop-genie/">Uniswap</a>, the largest decentralized exchange (DEX) by trading volume, has enabled crypto purchases through fiat. Users of Uniswap Protocol will now be able to buy crypto using their credit and debit cards as well as through a bank transfer. This feature has been developed in association with Moonpay.</p>



<h2><strong>Uniswap brings DeFi closer to users</strong></h2>



<p>The new feature has been <a href="https://uniswap.org/blog/web-fiat-on-ramp" rel="nofollow noopener">described</a> by the DEX as “direct to DeFi”. The aim is to eliminate the need for a middleman and bring users directly to the DeFi experience through a seamless onboarding experience.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>With self-custodial wallets, permissionless and immutable protocols, and a transparent public ledger, DEXs have built-in user protections.” the press release read.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>While card payments will be supported in 160+ countries, bank transfers will be available for most of the US, Brazil, Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), and the UK. As of now, users can purchase DAI, ETH, MATIC, USDC, USDT, WBTC, and WETH. However, WBTC and WETH will not be available for users in the US. As of now, Uniswap is only supporting four chains for this feature, namely Ethereum mainnet, Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>No minimum fees</strong></h2>



<p>Uniswap has clarified that this feature has been made available with zero minimum fees. Additionally, users can enjoy zero spreads on their USDC purchases. The protocol is also working to integrate an off-ramp so that users can send crypto back into their bank accounts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the feature has been marketed as a push towards DeFi, users who choose to go through Moonpay to purchase crypto will have to comply with its KYC/AML policy. Uniswap has clarified that the customer data acquired by Moonpay will not be shared with them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>A South Korean court ruled in favor of a freeze on assets owned by early investors of Terra&#8217;s ecosystem.</li><li>Prosecutors filed to lockdown assets controlled by seven persons including Kernel Labs CEO Amugae Kim.</li><li>The news is the latest from South Korean investigations into Terra&#8217;s $40 billion wipeout in May 2022. </li></ul>



<p>South Korean prosecutors received permission to freeze $92 million in assets linked to early Terra backers as investigations into Luna and UST’s collapse ramp up. Authorities also seized $108 million in assets from Do Kwon’s co-founder Daniel Shin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Seoul Southern District Court passed a motion authorizing the freeze after investigators discovered illicit proceeds tied to Luna, the governance tokens developed by fugitive Do Kwon and his blockchain company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prosecutors argued that sevens persons illegally amassed assets by offering pre-issued Luna tokens for huge profits, local media reported. The filing said that Kernel Labs CEO Amugae Kim and six others profited from this scheme prior to May’s collapse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kernel Labs was founded in 2018 as a blockchain payments developer and on-chain consultancy company. Investigators said that Kernel Labs and Terra shared a relationship, with some Kernel staff like Kim contributing significantly to Kwon’s blockchain company. Kim’s frozen assets were valued at around $61 million, per <a href="https://www.hankyung.com/finance/article/202212208809B" rel="nofollow noopener">reports</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Do Kwon was also named by prosecutors as one of the seven persons with illegal gains from pre-issued Luna coins.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Terra Investigations Heat Up</h2>



<p>Terra’s $40 billion implosion sent shockwaves throughout the digital asset industry. Luna was previously a top 10 cryptocurrency by market cap. Do Kwon’s algorithmic stablecoin UST ranked third among stablecoins before the token crashed alongside its sister crypto Luna.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Local and international authorities responded with investigations on several fronts, including warrants for Kwon’s arrest from <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/interpol-issues-a-red-notice-against-terraform-labs-founder-do-kwon-report/">Interpol</a> and South Korean law enforcement. Sources claimed that Kwon fled to Serbia and currently lives there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Engineers and developers who worked for Kwon were also barred from leaving South Korea at some point. Co-founder Danie Shin’s property was raided as investigators searched for clues into how Kwon’s company failed. Authorities also raided seven exchanges, confiscating transaction records in the process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lawmakers also pledged to develop regulatory policies aimed at protecting investors without hampering innovation in South Korea’s digital asset economy.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>A Bahamian magistrate has issued orders to extend the remand of Sam Bankman-Fried.</li><li>The former FTX CEO was expected to drop his extradition fight today in court.&nbsp;</li><li>SBF was reportedly shaking in the courtroom.</li><li>He will return to the Bahamas’ notorious Fox Hill prison.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Following a rather chaotic hearing today at the Nassau courthouse, Bahamian magistrate Shaka Serville ruled that Sam Bankman-Fried will not be extradited to the United States yet. The magistrate has issued orders to remand the former FTX CEO in the country.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Sam Bankman-Fried intended to waive his extradition</strong></h2>



<p>The news comes as a surprise given the widespread reports of Sam Bankman-Fried’s intention to surrender himself to U.S custody. According to a report by&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/19/ftx-founder-bankman-fried-sent-back-to-bahamas-jail-.html" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNBC</a>, even the Bahamian prosecutor acknowledged SBF’s intention to waive extradition. As per the report, Sam Bankman-Fried demanded to see a copy of his federal indictment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SBF was reportedly shaking in the courtroom. His defense attorney informed the court that Bankman-Fried’s presence in the court came as a “shock” to him. “I did not request him to be here this morning,” the attorney said. The former crypto billionaire will be taken away to Fox Hill prison in a heavily guarded convoy following the magistrate’s orders.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>No relief in sight for Sam Bankman-Fried</strong></h2>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried was first remanded to the notorious Fox Hill prison last week after the court&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://fortune.com/2022/12/13/sam-bankman-fried-denied-bail-ftx-judge-bahamas-sbf-fraud-case/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">rejected</a>&nbsp;his bail plea citing a flight risk. Given that he needed medical care, SBF was kept in the medical unit of the prison. The prison is known for its precarious condition. Lack of hygienic cells, poor nutrition, inadequate sanitation, and medical care among other things.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following the rejection of SBF’s bail application, his attorneys indicated that they would fight extradition at today’s hearing. However,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-us-extradition/" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports</a>&nbsp;emerged over the weekend that signaled that the former FTX CEO was ready to drop his extradition fight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>Binance&#8217;s American division successfully bid $1.022 billion for assets under bankrupt crypto broker Voyager Digital.</li><li>The deal could fast-track unlocking customer funds after Voyager collapsed in July 2022 due to market conditions and exposure to Three Arrows Capital.</li><li>Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s FTX bid $1.4 billion for Voyager&#8217;s asset before SBF&#8217;s crypto exchange crashed in November.</li></ul>



<p>BinanceUS sealed a deal to buy Voyager Digital assets after the crypto broker froze withdrawals and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July 2022. The official statement published on Monday said that BinanceUS was the highest bidder with $1.022 billion.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/ Today, <a href="https://twitter.com/BinanceUS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">@BinanceUS</a> was selected highest and best bid in Voyager’s reopened bankruptcy asset auction. Once the deal is completed, Voyager users will finally be able to access their digital assets on the <a href="https://t.co/Wc26vMosC4" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/Wc26vMosC4</a> platform.<br><br>Read: <a href="https://t.co/gBK5m3kcYn" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/gBK5m3kcYn</a></p>&mdash; Brian Shroder (@BrianShroder) <a href="https://twitter.com/BrianShroder/status/1604825059813920770?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">December 19, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>According to BinanceUS, the bid considered the “fair market value” of Voyager’s crypto portfolio. The massive $1 billion deal also accounted for an incremental value equal to $20 million.&nbsp; BinanceUS noted that should &#8220;sets a clear path forward for Voyager customer funds to be unlocked as soon as possible&#8221;. This means that Voyager users could see their crypto assets returned earlier than previously expected.</p>



<p>The agreement with BinanceUS is subject to a bankruptcy hearing on January 5, 2023, per Monday’s <a href="https://blog.binance.us/voyager-binance-us/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://blog.binance.us/voyager-binance-us/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement</a>. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The sale to Binance.US will be consummated pursuant to a Chapter 11 plan, which will be subject to a creditor vote and is subject to other customary closing conditions. Binance.US and the Company will work to close the transaction promptly following approval of the chapter 11 plan by the Bankruptcy Court.</p></blockquote>



<p>FTX under Sam Bankman-Fried successfully bid $1.4 billion for Voyager&#8217;s assets back in September but the deal fell through after SBF&#8217;s crypto exchange shuttered in November. </p>



<h2>Voyager Digital Crash</h2>



<p>Voyager Digital collapsed around mid-2022 following a downturn in the crypto asset prices and the collapse of several centralized finance digital asset entities. Previous reports cited exposure to bankruptcy crypto hedge fund <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/three-arrows-capital-creditors-july-18/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/three-arrows-capital-creditors-july-18/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Three Arrows Capital</a> (3AC) as another major reason behind Voyager’s tumble.</p>



<p>Voyager’s future was further dimmed after Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s crypto empire imploded in November. The crypto broker previously <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/voyager-digital-3ac-exposure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">secured</a> a $485 million credit line from Alameda Research, SBF’s quantitative trading behemoth. </p>



<p>Other CeFi crypto companies like <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/blockfi-bankruptcy-files-chapter-11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BlockFi</a>, Celsius, and FTX also filed for bankruptcy amid the 2022 bear market citing liquidity constraints, market volatility, and exposure to other virtual currency entities. </p>

<p>Sam Bankman-Fried is expected to surrender to U.S. extradition laws as authorities prosecute the former FTX crypto exchange founder for fraud and money laundering. Bankman-Fried will appear before a Bahamas court later on Monday to reverse his earlier decision, per reports from three media outlets.</p>



<p>Bahamas authorities arrested SBF on December 12 following a formal request from the Southern District of New York (SDNY) prosecutors. Sam Bankman-Fried appeared before a judge and contested extradition to the United States where he faces several allegations of fraud and money laundering. SBF’s $250,000 bail request was also denied, EthereumWorldNews reported.</p>



<p>Reports from <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/17/ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried-will-not-contest-us-extradition-in-alleged-fraud-case-source-says.html" rel="noopener">CNBC</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/sam-bankman-fried-reverse-decision-contesting-extradition-source-2022-12-17/" rel="nofollow noopener">Reuters</a>, and the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/12/17/sbf-prison-bahamas/" rel="nofollow noopener">Washington Post</a> cited sources close to Bankman-Fried who claimed that the fallen founder no longer planned to fight extradition to the U.S. Bahamas Fox Hill prison staff were also cited as sources.</p>



<p>As previously reported, SBF’s extradition hearing will take place on February 8, 2023, barring any changes. Sam Bankman-Fried could remain in Bahamas custody until then, in a prison that many describe as harsh and unforgiving.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>

<p>Solana-based decentralized exchange Raydium was exploited on Friday for around $2.5 million in digital assets, the project confirmed via a Twitter thread.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the Solana DEX, the project’s admin wallet was compromised and liquidity pool (LP) tokens were withdrawn without the team&#8217;s authorization. Raydium said the exploiter assumed “owner authority” in order to drain funds from the LP.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nansen confirmed that LP tokens were stolen from the Solana DEX, including some $⅙ million in SOL. Further investigations into the matter are underway, said the team.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Raydium Hack Spells Further Turbence For Solana’s DeFi Ecosystem</h2>



<p>Raydium’s TVL exceeded $45 million despite today’s $2.5 million hack, per data seen on the DEX’s liquidity pool dashboard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Friday’s hack on the DEX highlighted pressure in Solana&#8217;s decentralized finance ecosystem. Solana DeFi was thrown into uncertainty after the crash of FTX. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried back’s Solana development, including massive investments in projects like Serum.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Solana’s total value locked (TVL) fell below $300 million shortly after FTX filed for bankruptcy on November 11. The Solana Foundation also lost tens of millions stuck on the crypto exchange after withdrawals were paused.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The CFTC, SEC, and U.S. Attorneys from the Southern District of New York (SDNY) have since <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/cftc-alameda-ftx-client-funds-insolvency/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/cftc-alameda-ftx-client-funds-insolvency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">charged</a> Bankman-Fried with fraud and money laundering.
