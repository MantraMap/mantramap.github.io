            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jinwook Shin, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Bitsonic, has been apprehended by South Korean law enforcement on August 7th. He is currently being investigated for allegedly embezzling investments and deposits from users of the exchange.</p>
<p>According to the report by South Korean news agency Chosun Biz, Shin is being accused of fraudulently manipulating cryptocurrency prices and trading volume on Bitsonic, which led to the misappropriation of approximately 10 billion won ($7.5 million) from exchange users from January 2019 to May 2021.</p>
<ul>
<li>The prosecution stated that Shin <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/topics/topics_social/2023/08/08/W2KPDGP5SZCRRPMOS36DMLS6JM/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">operated</a> Bitsonic but did not purchase cryptocurrency during the same period.</li>
<li>But the CEO persisted in providing cryptocurrencies to new customers despite the onset of liquidity problems and the suspension of withdrawals on the crypto platform, Seoul&#8217;s cyber crime department alleged.</li>
<li>BitSonic announced shutting down its operations in August 2021 and attributed the decision to &#8220;internal and external issues.&#8221;</li>
<li>Shortly thereafter, the South Korean authorities closed down 11 domestic cryptocurrency platforms for alleged fraudulent activities.</li>
<li>The ensuing inquiry also claimed the involvement of the company&#8217;s vice president in orchestrating a scheme to acquire the crypto held by the CEO within the exchange system.</li>
<li>In the process of manipulation, Shin purportedly utilized a shell company established in Singapore.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, the vice president of Bitsonic is also slated to face trial without being subject to preliminary detention.</li>
<li>Off late, South Korean authoritoes have taken a hardline approach against fraudulent activities within the digital asset industry.</li>
<li>Last month, Korea Securities Depository <a href="https://www.fnnews.com/news/202307261412399732" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">unveiled</a> a partnership with Code, a firm specializing in Travel Rules, to promote the issuance and utilization of Legal Entity Identifiers (LEI) within the virtual asset market.</li>
<li>This initiative seeks to tackle the surge in unlawful activities within the market while also fulfilling the demand for enhanced investor safeguard.</li>
<li>Besides, the Korean government was reportedly <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/south-korea-to-build-a-crypto-tracking-system-to-prevent-cybercrime-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">building</a> a crypto-tracking system to prevent cybercrime.</li>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The central bank digital currency (CBDC) issued by Banco Central do Brasil is reportedly set to see the light of day in 2024. Its main purpose will be to boost financial services in the country.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The South American nation is not the only one willing to introduce such a monetary product. China, Russia, Japan, Australia, the United Kingdom, and many more have also displayed such intentions. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/brazil-central-bank-names-its-digital-currency-drex-scheduled-2024-launch-2023-08-07/?rpc=401&amp;" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">reported</a> by Reuters, Brazil&#8217;s CBDC will be named DREX and is expected to go live next year. It will employ distributed ledger technology (DLT) to settle wholesale interbank transactions, whereas retail access will be based on the digital equivalent of existing bank deposits. </span></li>
<li>Fabio Araujo &#8211; coordinator of the digital real &#8211; said DREX will aim at advancing the domestic financial network by improving access to monetary services. He raised hopes that it could also boost investments, lending, and insurance services.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;By enabling simple and reliable access to registered values through DLT technology, we reduce costs and democratize access to financial services,&#8221; he stated.</span></p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Araujo argued that some Brazilians have already started conducting digital settlements via the payment platform Pix. </span></li>
<li>It is interesting to note that well-known finance companies have supported Brazil&#8217;s CBDC project. Some examples are the payment processing giant Mastercard and the leading developer of software services Sinqia.</li>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The highly-anticipated layer-2 scaling solution, Shibarium, is set to launch soon, leading many to anticipate that it could catalyze a Shiba Inu ($SHIB) price rally.</p>
<p>By enhancing transaction speeds and cutting costs, Shibarium promises to increase $SHIB&#8217;s utility and reignite excitement post-launch.</p>
<p>Other meme coins, such as Wall Street Memes ($WSM) and Shibie Coin ($SHIBIE), might also capitalize on the rising investor interest due to Shibarium’s launch and its potential impact on the wider market.</p>
<h2>1. Improved Utility for $SHIB</h2>
<p>The first reason that Shiba Inu could turn bullish after Shibarium’s release is the vastly improved utility it will provide the token.</p>
<p>By implementing layer-2 technology to boost transaction speeds and cut network fees, Shibarium will make $SHIB a far more practical option for those looking to make transactions and payments.</p>
<p>With the ability to send $SHIB faster and cheaper, real-world adoption and usage of the token could increase significantly.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-14.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-265704" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-14.jpg" alt="Picture1" width="602" height="353" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-14.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-14-300x176.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-14-50x29.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>This expanded utility will likely boost demand as more individuals and businesses seek to acquire $SHIB to leverage its new capabilities.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/shib/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">data from Cryptwerk.com</a>, only 767 merchants worldwide accept $SHIB – a figure that could rise post-Shibarium.</p>
<p>Ultimately, any demand increase would translate into more positive price movements, which would be further bolstered since $SHIB also has a built-in burn mechanism.</p>
<h2>2. Renewed Hype Around the Shiba Inu Ecosystem</h2>
<p>In addition to enhanced utility, the launch of Shibarium will likely boost the hype and investor interest around the Shiba Inu ecosystem.</p>
<p>The community has been waiting for Shibarium’s release for a while, meaning its launch is primed to generate tremendous excitement.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies often thrive on momentum, which is even more pronounced for meme coins like $SHIB – meaning the post-Shibarium phase could drive new token investment.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-13.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-265703" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-13.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="179" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-13.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-13-300x89.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-13-50x15.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Additionally, $SHIB holders will be encouraged that the Shiba Inu team delivered on their promises, potentially convincing a percentage of the investor base to purchase more tokens.</p>
<p>This could create a snowball effect, where the price rises and FOMO ensues, leading more people to buy $SHIB.</p>
<p>Ultimately, a successful Shibarium rollout will kickstart the project&#8217;s momentum again, igniting the bullish sentiment around $SHIB from an investment perspective.</p>
<h2>3. Increased Likelihood of New $SHIB Use Cases</h2>
<p>The third factor likely to turn $SHIB bullish after Shibarium is the expanded adoption it could fuel by enabling new use cases.</p>
<p>By improving transaction efficiency, Shibarium opens the door to creating uses for $SHIB that weren’t previously viable.</p>
<p>This includes use cases related to NFTs, metaverse integrations, blockchain gaming applications, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-16.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-265702" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-16.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="496" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-16.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-16-300x247.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-16-50x41.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>With a more scalable platform, decentralized application (dApp) developers are more likely to build their platforms on Shibarium, which will drive further adoption of $SHIB.</p>
<p>As of now, <a href="https://shibaswap.com/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ShibaSwap</a> is the only noteworthy platform on the Shiba Inu network, serving as the ecosystem&#8217;s native DEX</p>
<p>But with Shibarium lowering network fees and enabling faster transactions, the path is clear for many more dApps to be deployed.</p>
<p>This influx of new products and services could attract fresh users to the ecosystem, spurring demand for $SHIB.</p>
<h2>Which Other Meme Coins Could Benefit from Shibarium’s Release?</h2>
<p>While Shiba Inu stands to gain the most from Shibarium’s release, other meme coins could also capitalize on renewed investor interest.</p>
<p>Two meme coin projects worth watching that could ride the Shibarium hype are Wall Street Memes and Shibie Coin.</p>
<h2>Wall Street Memes Presale Nears $23 Million Raised Ahead of Shibarium Launch</h2>
<p><a href="https://bs_54c27399.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=will-shiba-inus-price-pump-after-shibarium-wall-street-memes-also-bullish" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Memes ($WSM)</a> is an emerging meme coin that has raised nearly $23 million during its presale phase.</p>
<p>This impressive traction is thanks to the community interest around the $WSM token, which is available for $0.0331.</p>
<p>The creators of Wall Street Memes have leveraged their previous experience developing the popular <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/wall-street-bulls" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall St Bulls NFT collection</a>, which sold out rapidly back in 2021.</p>
<p>Now the creators aim to bring the same community-building expertise to the meme coin space with the release of $WSM.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-10.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-265701" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-10.jpg" alt="Picture4" width="602" height="197" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-10.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-10-300x98.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-10-50x16.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>A full 50% of the total $WSM supply is being allocated to presale participants, highlighting the community-focused approach of Wall Street Memes’ creators.</p>
<p>The other half will be split between exchange liquidity, marketing, and rewards.</p>
<p>Demand for $WSM shows no signs of slowing, with the <a href="https://t.me/wallst_memes" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">project’s Telegram channel</a> seeing hundreds of new members join daily.</p>
<p>$WSM demand has also been boosted by Wall Street Memes’ ambitious roadmap, which showcases plans for Tier-1 CEX listings and even a $1 billion market cap.</p>
<p>All in all, Wall Street Memes&#8217; potential is clear – setting it up to benefit from the meme coin buzz that will likely surround Shibarium’s launch.</p>

<h2>Shibie Coin Also Looks to Ride Post-Shibarium Hype</h2>
<p><a href="https://bs_6e47ad52.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=will-shiba-inus-price-pump-after-shibarium-wall-street-memes-also-bullish" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Shibie Coin ($SHIBIE)</a> is another brand-new meme coin that could benefit from the release of Shibarium’s mainnet.</p>
<p>This unique project brands itself as a Shiba Inu-Barbie crossover, aiming to capitalize on the hype surrounding the viral Barbie movie.</p>
<p>The token also leverages the popularity of “Doge-themed” meme coins, such as $DOGE and $SHIB.</p>
<p>Shibie Coin’s presale has been an instant hit with investors, raising over $265,000 in just two weeks.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture5-6.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-265700" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture5-6.jpg" alt="Picture5" width="602" height="156" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture5-6.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture5-6-300x78.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture5-6-50x13.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Alongside $SHIBIE’s provocative branding, demand has also been spurred by the token’s low price of $0.000167.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://shibie.io/whitepaper/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Shibie Coin’s whitepaper</a>, the project&#8217;s distribution structure has been designed with the community in mind, given that 60% of the total supply is reserved for presale investors.</p>
<p>This means over half of the $SHIBIE tokens will be in the hands of early adopters – establishing a broad token holder base essential for community engagement.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://twitter.com/ShibieCoin" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Shibie Coin’s Twitter account</a> seeing significant growth, the project&#8217;s social media marketing push is bearing fruit, positioning it to benefit from Shibarium’s long-awaited release.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Fenwick &#38; West's services “went well beyond those a law firm should and usually does provide” in assisting the FTX purported fraud, the complaint reads.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A group of customers of the once-prominent cryptocurrency exchange FTX has reportedly filed a lawsuit against the law firm Fenwick &amp; West, insisting that it contributed to the alleged scam orchestrated by Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) and the subsequent multi-billion losses it brought. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The former leader of the exchange has pleaded not guilty to the fraud charges against him. He currently lives with his family, awaiting the trial at the beginning of October, which will determine whether he played a role in one of the biggest crashes in the history of crypto.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Second Such Attack on Fenwick &amp; West</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to a recent Reuters </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/ftx-law-firm-fenwick-faces-second-lawsuit-by-crypto-customers-2023-08-07/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">coverage</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, the complaint filed in the Northern District of California alleges the law company of bypassing regulatory rules and establishing entities that SBF and other former FTX executives employed to commit fraud.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Specifically, those organizations helped the crypto company to misappropriate users&#8217; funds and use them on speculative investments or make political and charitable donations. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The group of investors described Fenwick &amp; West as the main outside law firm for FTX, maintaining that its attorneys had insight into the exchange&#8217;s &#8220;convoluted organizational structure, abject lack of internal controls, and dubious business practices.&#8221;</span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The Gemini crypto exchange has announced that users can now deposit XRP tokens on the platform.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gemini confirmed it now accepts XRP deposits after days of speculation driven by a cryptic post on its verified X account. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The post, a thinking face emoji, was made <a href="https://twitter.com/Gemini/status/1682416629097873408?s=20" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">in response</a> to a question by crypto journalist David Gokhstein, who wondered whether Gemini would relist XRP.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its </span><a href="https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-adds-support-for-xrp" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announcement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Gemini clarified that it would initially only accept XRP deposits, but it is working on enabling XRP-related trading pairs in the coming days. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exchange also asked its users to update their mobile apps to allow the new feature to take effect.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gemini is the latest to <a href="https://twitter.com/Gemini/status/1689634981738401793" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">relist XRP</a> after Ripple won a partial </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripples-secondary-sales-of-xrp-not-an-investment-contract-judge-rules-following-over-3-year-long-legal-battle/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">victory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a case brought against it by the SEC. In a July 14 ruling, presiding Judge Analisa Torres found that XRP may not be considered a security if sold on secondary markets. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the verdict, several crypto exchanges, including Kraken, Bitstamp, and Crypto.com, </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/these-crypto-exchanges-re-listed-xrp-following-ripples-victory-against-the-sec/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reinstated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> XRP.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in a new twist, the SEC has signaled its intention to </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/is-xrp-in-trouble-again-sec-signals-appeal-in-ripple-case/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">challenge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Judge Torres’ decision after it filed a letter of appeal on August 9.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elsewhere, Ripple has been made a </span><a href="https://t.co/yDQmdOmp9m" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">member</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) cross-border payments taskforce.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The BIS serves as the hub for international monetary authorities. Many observers believe Ripple’s inclusion into the 33-member committee shows the company’s growing acceptance in the mainstream financial space since its win against the SEC. </span></li>

			            <description><![CDATA[Coinbase and Binance's wallets were prone to the vulnerability, but both have already been patched. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Crypto infrastructure giant Fireblocks has publicly revealed security vulnerabilities in the technology used by over a dozen major digital asset wallet providers.</p>
<p>If unaddressed, the company warned that attackers could exploit the bugs to steal from millions of customers.</p>
<h2>The Bitforge Exploits</h2>
<p>The set of vulnerabilities – collectively referred to as “Bitforge” – apply to popular multi-party-computation (MPC) protocols, including GG-18 , GG-20, and Lindell17. These protocols allow cryptocurrency to be controlled and managed by multiple individuals and groups.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The BitForge vulnerabilities, if left unremedied, would enable attackers to exploit a newly discovered flaw in the GG18 and GG20 protocols by exfiltrating the full private key due to a missing zero-knowledge proof,” wrote Fireblocks in a <a href="https://www.fireblocks.com/blog/bitforge-fireblocks-researchers-uncover-vulnerabilities-in-over-15-major-wallet-providers" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">statement</a> on Wednesday.</p></blockquote>
<p>The company stated that all vendors using the protocols “should be considered vulnerable.”</p>
<p>The Lindell17 vulnerability, it wrote, was due to wallet providers deviating from the academic paper, “creating a backdoor for attackers to expose part of the private key when signing fails.” The exploits have already been validated on major open-source implementations.</p>
<h2>Coinbase and Binance Affected, But Funds Are Safe</h2>
<p>In an accompanying <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fireblocks-researchers-uncover-vulnerabilities-impacting-dozens-of-major-wallet-providers-301897357.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">press release</a>, Fireblocks named popular providers including <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-releases-encrypted-decentralized-messaging-functionality-in-wallets/" data-wpel-link="internal">Coinbase</a> WaaS, Zengo, and Binance as having been impacted by the vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>However, having been privately notified by the firm beforehand, Fireblocks said the prior three firms have already patched the issues, and the relevant academic papers have been appropriately revised.</p>
<blockquote><p>“While Coinbase customers and funds were never at risk, maintaining a fully trustless cryptographic model is an important aspect of any MPC implementation,” said Jeff Lunglhofer, Chief Information Security Officer at Coinbase, regarding the patch.</p></blockquote>
<p>Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao also clarified on Thursday that the exchange has patched the vulnerability and that no user funds had been affected.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1689556596332867584</p>
<p>In a statement, Fireblocks CTO Pavel Berengoltz wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;While we are encouraged to see that MPC is now ubiquitous within the digital asset industry, it is evident from our findings — and our subsequent disclosure process — that not all MPC developers and teams are created equal.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The CTO noted that over $500 million were stolen in <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/atomic-wallet-hackers-continue-laundering-funds-through-binance-kucoin-huobi/" data-wpel-link="internal">wallet thefts</a> and attacks over the first half of 2023.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[A digital dollar's creation could mean a "checkmate" and "game over," Joe Rogan stated.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The popular podcaster and commentator &#8211; Joe Rogan &#8211; and the famous musician &#8211; Austin Richard Post (better known by his stage name Post Malone) &#8211; appear to be against the probable launch of a digital dollar. The former went even further, suggesting that such a financial product would cause a &#8220;game over&#8221; scenario.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The potential creation of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) has emerged as a highly controversial topic, with many other prominent individuals arguing against it. Such examples are the presidential candidates Ron DeSantis and Robert F. Kennedy.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8216;No Way&#8217;</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Rogan and his most recent podcast guest Post Malone <a href="https://twitter.com/VigilantFox/status/1689015119764672514?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1689015119764672514%7Ctwgr%5Eadd2eebb8195c819bb8c6154a6e317592d361dd6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fjoe-rogan-slams-cbdc-podcast-post-malone" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">touched upon</a> numerous interesting subjects during their conversation, including CBDCs. Asked how he would feel if the US government goes forward with that product, Rogan said:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;No f*ucking way. No way. That&#8217;s what I think. I think that&#8217;s checkmate. That&#8217;s game over.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<figure id="attachment_265642" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-265642" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Joe-Rogan.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-265642" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Joe-Rogan.webp" alt="Joe Rogan" width="500" height="400" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Joe-Rogan.webp 960w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Joe-Rogan-300x240.webp 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Joe-Rogan-768x614.webp 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Joe-Rogan-50x40.webp 50w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-265642" class="wp-caption-text">Joe Rogan, Source: Forbes</figcaption></figure>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Post Malone agreed with the comments, adding his name to the lengthy list of people who believe a digital dollar would not bring any economic benefits to American society.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Rogan also suggested that the government could use the CBDC to monitor and control people&#8217;s transactions. Post Malone accepted that thesis, maintaining that the authorities are already tracking proceedings since &#8220;everything is imprinted and digital.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The eventual launch of a digital dollar has sparked huge debates over the years, with the opponents of that monetary product viewing its centralized nature as its main disadvantage.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">CBDCs have captured the attention of some of the US presidential candidates, including the Republican nominee Ron DeSantis and the Democrat Robert F. Kennedy.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The former recently </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/us-presidential-candidate-ron-desantis-to-end-bidens-war-on-bitcoin-if-elected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">vowed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to throw the digital dollar into the &#8220;trash can&#8221; once he gets elected as America&#8217;s next political leader. Kennedy </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/jfks-nephew-bitcoin-is-an-escape-route-from-the-turmoil-caused-by-the-fed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">believes</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the government could employ the CBDC as an &#8220;ultimate mechanism for social surveillance and control.&#8221; On the other hand, both men are outspoken advocates of bitcoin, promising to let the asset thrive under their potential administrations. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Previous Crypto Forays of Rogan and Post Malone</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Besides giving his two cents on CBDCs, Rogan has previously </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/joe-rogan-believes-the-us-government-fears-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">touched upon</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> bitcoin. In his view, it has emerged as a &#8220;viable form of currency,&#8221; while its current status could be compared to the early days of the Internet:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;I think of bitcoin the same way I think about the early Internet.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Subsequently, he </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/joe-rogan-i-have-a-lot-of-hope-for-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">said</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> he has &#8220;a lot of hope for cryptocurrencies,&#8221; admitting that he is not an expert in the field.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Post Malone has already hopped on the digital asset bandwagon, purchasing a non-fungible token (NFT) part of the Bore Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) in 2021. He also </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tc0tLGWIqxA" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">featured</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> his collectible in the video of his song &#8220;One Right Now.&#8221;</span></p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The leading financial technology company &#8211; Revolut &#8211; reportedly plans to increase its global cryptocurrency team by hiring up to 20% more employees by the end of 2023.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The move comes somewhat unexpectedly since the firm recently disclosed that it will suspend digital asset services to US-based customers from September.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/revolut-jobs-crypto-20-by-year-end-20230810?mod=topic_news" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">revealed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> by Financial News, Revolut is set to onboard over 1,000 people this year across the United Kingdom, Europe, and India. Approximately 40% of those people will be added to the UK unit. </span></li>
<li>The company is looking for candidates for numerous positions related to crypto compliance and investigations for global markets such as Spain, India, and Poland.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;We are indeed continuing to hire and grow the business as we continue to expand,&#8221; a Revolut spokesperson supposedly told the media outlet.</span></p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Specifically, the fintech giant intends to increase its crypto headcount by roughly one-fifth before the year&#8217;s end. </span></li>
<li>The upcoming hiring spree could indicate that Revolut remains committed to the digital asset industry despite the terminated services for American clients.</li>
<li>It <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/heres-why-revolut-will-stop-providing-crypto-services-to-american-clients-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">announced</a> last week that US-based users won&#8217;t be able to purchase cryptocurrencies from the platform from September 2, whereas selling and holding will be ceased from October 3.</li>
<li>Similar to some other companies, Revolut pointed out the regulatory uncertainty in the world&#8217;s largest economy as the main contributing factor behind its decision:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;As a result of the evolving regulatory environment and the uncertainties around the crypto market in the US, we&#8217;ve taken the difficult decision, together with our US banking partner, to suspend access to cryptocurrencies through Revolut in the US.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>

			            <description><![CDATA["Ramp will support Base right from its inception, enabling transactions with ETH and USDC from day one," CEO Sypniewicz said.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ramp Network &#8211; a fintech startup that offers payment infrastructure to connect crypto and traditional finance &#8211; added support to the Ethereum Layer 2 chain Base. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The integration will aid third-party developers and enable clients to convert dozens of fiat currencies into ETH and USDC.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8216;Exciting Times Ahead&#8217;</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to a document seen by </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">CryptoPotato</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, Ramp Network has dived even further into the world of crypto by integrating the Coinbase-developed Layer 2 network &#8211; Base. Speaking on the matter was the company&#8217;s CEO &#8211; Szymon Sypniewicz:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;In alignment with our steadfast commitment to giving our users choice and greater access to the ecosystem&#8217;s Layer 2 solutions, Ramp will support Base right from its inception, enabling transactions with ETH and USDC from day one. Exciting times ahead!&#8221; </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Besides allowing the conversion of fiat to the aforementioned digital currencies, the integration of Base will support third-party developers. It will enable them to create applications using Ramp&#8217;s services. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;This will accelerate the creation of novel apps that capitalize on the powerful network effects afforded by the new layer 2,&#8221; the document reads.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Launched in 2017, Ramp Network has expanded its presence over the years, establishing offices in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Poland. It employs over 160 people globally and supports more than 40 crypto assets.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Base&#8217;s Recent Developments</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The collaboration with Ramp Network comes less than a month after Base <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbases-l2-network-base-opens-mainnet-for-builders/" data-wpel-link="internal">opened</a> its mainnet for builders, allowing them to deploy their products. The entity </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">introduced various tools to support the developers&#8217; efforts, including smart wallet infrastructure, node providers, and data indexers. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The team behind Base also vowed to release a &#8220;Genesis Builder&#8221; non-fungible token (NFT) to commemorate those who hopped on the bandwagon from day one. Nonetheless, it has no intentions of issuing a network token.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In addition, Base revealed that a public launch scheduled for August will enable more users to onboard the network:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;With our mainnet GA launch in early August, we&#8217;ll welcome everyday users to feel how on-chain is the next online with a seamless, easy, secure experience across hundreds of products on Base.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
