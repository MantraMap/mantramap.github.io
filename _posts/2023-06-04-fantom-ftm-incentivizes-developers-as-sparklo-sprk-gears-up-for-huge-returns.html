<p>Fantom (FTM) Innovative Approach: Remunerating Developers for Gas Fees Generated</p>
<p>Fantom (FTM), a prominent player in the blockchain space, has just announced a unique initiative, the "Gas Monetization Program." According to the May 31 announcement, the Fantom (FTM) Opera network team will now compensate developers for the gas fees produced by their applications. To be eligible for the program, apps must have conducted over 125,000 transactions and been live on the Fantom network for at least three months.</p>
<p>Six Web3 apps, including ParaSwap, Beethoven X, Stargate, LayerZero, WOOFi, and SpookySwap, have already been approved and are actively partaking in this program. However, it's not unrestricted access for all developers, as those with inefficient gas contracts may face competition and potential suspension from the program. With this new program, Fantom (FTM) hopes to create an alternative revenue source for developers, encouraging a sustainable ecosystem.</p>
