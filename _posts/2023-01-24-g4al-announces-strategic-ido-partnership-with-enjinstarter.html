<p>Enjinstarter and Games For A Living (G4AL) announced a strategic partnership with a $100,000 USD IDO agreement. The partnership will focus on enabling and providing quality Web3 games to the masses.&nbsp;</p>

The partnership aims to promote the many utilities that G4AL has to offer to onboard games developers to the blockchain with no difficulty. Additionally, Enjinstarter will also be working closely with teams at G4AL and all the games under its umbrella, alongside its partners such as DVerse towards partnerships, promotions, campaigns, AMAs and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>G4AL&rsquo;s core focus lies in developing a suite of services and offerings for blockchain games, with plug and deploy models integrated into game engines easing game studios&rsquo; developer pipelines.&nbsp;</p>
