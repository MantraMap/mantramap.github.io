Clayton stated that the Bitcoin market may have matured enough to warrant regulatory approval for an ETF. Clayton suggested that it would be difficult to resist approving a Bitcoin Spot ETF if the spot market is comparable in efficacy to the futures market. The introduction of a Bitcoin ETF would allow investors to track Bitcoin&#8217;s price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency, reducing perceived risks. [&#8230;]
