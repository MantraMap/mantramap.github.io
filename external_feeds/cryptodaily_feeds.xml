			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s5">Uwerx is a soon-to-launch blockchain-based freelance project that has quickly become the most sought-after project by investors. Since the start of its presale, Uwerx's innovative features have propelled it forward. </p>
<p class="s5">The project has continued to sell out fast at each presale, leading the developers to increase the token allocations to accommodate more users. </p>
<p class="s5">This article will examine Uwerx's success and highlight what analysts predict for Cosmos Hub (ATOM) and &nbsp;Gala (GALA). </p>
Can Uwerx (WERX) Continue On Its Winning Path?
<p class="s5">Despite being only two months into its presale, Uwerx has recorded huge wins. These wins have attracted 5,546 signups, 1,620 Twitter followers, and 1,685 Telegram members to the project. Priced at just $0.041/WERX, Uwerx has become a great opportunity for investors to make massive profits in the coin market. </p>
<p class="s5">The project is gearing up to run a test airdrop which experts believe will further engage Uwerxholders. This test airdrop was voted for by 98.2% of the Uwerx community, and the Uwerx team considers it a means to ensure that users entered the correct Receiving Wallet addresses.</p>
<p class="s5">Uwerx's presale exceeded everyone's expectations, leading the Uwerx team to modify the project's token allocation. Uwerx now offers 57% of the 750 million total token supply, representing 427,500,000 tokens. The team also increased the project's launch price to $0.095 - $0.115. </p>
<p class="s5">Uwerx's presale success is primarily due to the agile methodology approach that its developers adopted. It allowed them to release Uwerx in stages while making improvements with time.</p>
<p class="s5">Committed to serving its community, the Uwerx team locked developers' liquidity for 25 years on June 7, 2023, following 82.8% of the Uwerx community voting for it.</p>
<p class="s5">Uwerx aims to revolutionize the freelance industry by offering decentralization and low transaction fees at a 1% rate compared to traditional freelance platforms. It will offer transparent pricing, innovative earning opportunities, collaborative tools, and faster transactions. These features have set Uwerx apart and positioned it as the best option in the ever-growing freelancing industry. </p>
<p class="s5">According to a 2022 Forbes survey, 80% of U.S. employees are attracted to freelancing. This suggests that the freelance market will receive an influx of new freelancers, and Uwerx aims to get a huge share of that market.</p>
<p class="s5">The Uwerx team also introduced a feature called the Uwerx Vault. This feature allows users to save WERX tokens for a desired period. </p>
<p class="s5">Additionally, Uwerx has already launched the Alpha Version of its platform, giving users access to some of its key features, including the Landing, Sign-up, Login, Forgot Password, Hiring Dashboard, Freelancer/Client Initiation, The Initial Step of Job Creation and Initial Step of Finding Talent, My Activity, and Job Creation Process pages. </p>
<p class="s5">The team has announced that they will be launching additional functionalities soon. This has caused excitement among users already anticipating the release of the platform's Beta version. Additionally, the latest news that the team will introduce referral bonuses soon has added to investors' excitement.</p>
<p class="s5">Uwerx urges users to share their suggestions and recommendations through the dedicated email address feedback@uwerx.network. This will enable users to contribute to enhancing the platform.</p>
Investors Are Unsure If Cosmos Hub (ATOM) Will Rise Again
<p class="s5">Since 2021, Cosmos Hub (ATOM) has been making considerable progress in the coin market. However, the project has been falling in the last one month. Cosmos Hub (ATOM) is trading at $10.21, representing a -21.51 decline in the past month. The story has been the same for the last seven days as Cosmos Hub (ATOM) declined by -6.79. </p>
<p class="s5">The main aim of Cosmos Hub (ATOM) is to facilitate faster, cheaper and more scalable transactions. The project focuses on sovereignty and sustainability and facilitates interoperability between blockchains. </p>
<p class="s5">Cosmos Hub (ATOM) recorded important partnerships last month, notably with Stride. This partnership with Stride saw Cosmos Hub (ATOM) taking home 15% of STRD inflationary staking rewards, 15% of transaction fees and 15% of MEV revenue. </p>
<p class="s5">As Cosmos Hub (ATOM) enters the second week of June, holders expect more partnerships which could drive the price of Cosmos Hub up. Analysts predict the project will trade at $19.31 by the second quarter of 2024. </p>
How Will Gala (GALA) Perform This Month
<p class="s5">Last month was an eventful one for Gala (GALA). The project released the second version of the GALA token, which brought in more investors. Gala (GALA) also partnered with BitkubAcademy to develop educational content in the Web 3.0 industry. They also conducted the V2 airdrop and burned almost 21 billion GALA (GALA) tokens worth more than $637 million. These moves put investors' minds at ease and renewed their trust in the Gala (GALA) project. </p>
<p class="s5">Also in May, Gala Games partnered with PokerGo to build a Web3 social poker game. Gala (GALA) holders believe this partnership will lead to more exposure for Gala (GALA). </p>
<p class="s5">Despite these developments, Gala (GALA) entered the month of June declining in price. The project decreased by -37.8% in the last month. Gala (GALA) trades at $0.028, representing a 4.82% increase in the past 24hrs. Analysts predict the project will reach $0.051 by the second quarter of 2024.</p>
<p class="s5">This prediction is very little compared to what analysts predict for Uwerx. They are convinced that Uwerx has what it takes to surpass $2.50 by January 2024. As such, many investors are rushing to buy WERX tokens for the low price of $0.05245. </p>
<p class="s5">Knowing that the project has undergone InterFi Network and SolidProof audits, investors are confident that their funds are safe.</p>

These features have set Uwerx apart and positioned it as the best option in the ever-growing freelancing industry. </p>
<p class="s5">According to a 2022 Forbes survey, 80% of U.S. employees are attracted to freelancing. This suggests that the freelance market will receive an influx of new freelancers, and Uwerx aims to get a huge share of that market.</p>
<p class="s5">The Uwerx team also introduced a feature called the Uwerx Vault. This feature allows users to save WERX tokens for a desired period. </p>
<p class="s5">Additionally, Uwerx has already launched the Alpha Version of its platform, giving users access to some of its key features, including the Landing, Sign-up, Login, Forgot Password, Hiring Dashboard, Freelancer/Client Initiation, The Initial Step of Job Creation and Initial Step of Finding Talent, My Activity, and Job Creation Process pages. </p>
<p class="s5">The team has announced that they will be launching additional functionalities soon. This has caused excitement among users already anticipating the release of the platform's Beta version. Additionally, the latest news that the team will introduce referral bonuses soon has added to investors' excitement.</p>
<p class="s5">Uwerx urges users to share their suggestions and recommendations through the dedicated email address feedback@uwerx.network. This will enable users to contribute to enhancing the platform.</p>
Investors Are Unsure If Cosmos Hub (ATOM) Will Rise Again
<p class="s5">Since 2021, Cosmos Hub (ATOM) has been making considerable progress in the coin market. However, the project has been falling in the last one month. Cosmos Hub (ATOM) is trading at $10.21, representing a -21.51 decline in the past month. The story has been the same for the last seven days as Cosmos Hub (ATOM) declined by -6.79. </p>
<p class="s5">The main aim of Cosmos Hub (ATOM) is to facilitate faster, cheaper and more scalable transactions. The project focuses on sovereignty and sustainability and facilitates interoperability between blockchains. </p>
<p class="s5">Cosmos Hub (ATOM) recorded important partnerships last month, notably with Stride. This partnership with Stride saw Cosmos Hub (ATOM) taking home 15% of STRD inflationary staking rewards, 15% of transaction fees and 15% of MEV revenue. </p>
<p class="s5">As Cosmos Hub (ATOM) enters the second week of June, holders expect more partnerships which could drive the price of Cosmos Hub up. Analysts predict the project will trade at $19.31 by the second quarter of 2024. </p>
How Will Gala (GALA) Perform This Month
<p class="s5">Last month was an eventful one for Gala (GALA). The project released the second version of the GALA token, which brought in more investors. Gala (GALA) also partnered with BitkubAcademy to develop educational content in the Web 3.0 industry. They also conducted the V2 airdrop and burned almost 21 billion GALA (GALA) tokens worth more than $637 million. These moves put investors' minds at ease and renewed their trust in the Gala (GALA) project. </p>
<p class="s5">Also in May, Gala Games partnered with PokerGo to build a Web3 social poker game. Gala (GALA) holders believe this partnership will lead to more exposure for Gala (GALA). </p>
<p class="s5">Despite these developments, Gala (GALA) entered the month of June declining in price. The project decreased by -37.8% in the last month. Gala (GALA) trades at $0.028, representing a 4.82% increase in the past 24hrs. Analysts predict the project will reach $0.051 by the second quarter of 2024.</p>
<p class="s5">This prediction is very little compared to what analysts predict for Uwerx. They are convinced that Uwerx has what it takes to surpass $2.50 by January 2024. As such, many investors are rushing to buy WERX tokens for the low price of $0.05245. </p>
<p class="s5">Knowing that the project has undergone InterFi Network and SolidProof audits, investors are confident that their funds are safe.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s6">As the crypto market is evolving rapidly, investors are looking for stable projects for investments. The market value of Tradecurve (TCRV) is projected to soar by 80x in 2023. On the contrary, Neo (NEO) and Polkadot (DOT) are witnessing an erosion in their investor base. </p>
<p class="s6">Therefore, Tradecurve&rsquo;s presale has become a huge hit from the very first day of its launch due to its stable and growth-bound business roadmap.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>
Neo (NEO) Launches Neo Compounder
<p class="s6">Neo (NEO) has recently taken measures to expand its universe, and protect its price from falling. The price of Neo (NEO) has been on a free fall for the last few weeks, and has plummeted by 10% in the past 7 days. As a result, the trading price of Neo (NEO) has come down to $10.82, which is about 95% below its peak price of $196.85. </p>
<p class="s6">To break this bearish momentum, Neo (NEO) recently announced that Neo Compounder has been made live. According to the project developers, Neo Compounder will auto-compound users&rsquo; GAS rewards into more NEO tokens. Analysts believe that this development will incentivize users to increase their activity on the Neo (NEO) network. </p>
<p class="s6">This, in turn, can help the Neo (NEO) network register a positive growth rate in the coming weeks. </p>
Polkadot (DOT) Tops GitHub Commit Rankings
<p class="s6">Polkadot (DOT) recently bagged the top spot in GitHub commit rankings. According to data from Santiment, Polkadot was ranked first in the list of the top 20 fastest-developed crypto assets. The top position on the list indicates that the level of development activity on the Polkadot network has been higher than other blockchains. </p>
<p class="s6">As per experts, high development activity can boost investors&rsquo; confidence in the Polkadotnetwork, as it hints about an upcoming surge in the value of DOT tokens. In another event, the social network, MeWe, recently integrated with the Polkadot ecosystem. This can also increase the user base of Polkadot. Currently, Polkadot is trading at $5.91, after suffering a fall of 7% in the last week. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>
Tradecurve (TCRV) Eyes Big Jump During Presale
<p class="s6">The ecosystem and dominance of the crypto market are expanding at a fast pace. The number of crypto traders is expected to cross 994 million in the next four years. Tradecurve, a new Web3 platform, is tapping this huge market with an ingenious business roadmap and platform.</p>
<p class="s6">It is expected to emerge as one of the world&rsquo;s top three trading exchanges. It is a blockchain-based trading platform that enables users to access a wide range of assets, enjoy complete anonymity, and trade at lower fees.</p>
<p class="s6">The trading platforms currently available in the market are either dedicated to only cryptocurrencies (Huobi and KuCoin), or exclusively deal with the trade of conventional derivatives (TD Ameritrade). </p>
<p class="s6">But Tradecurve (TCRV) allows the trading of cryptocurrencies, stocks, Forex, commodities, ETFs, bonds, and more, on the same platform, and from a single account.</p>
<p class="s6">Its presale is currently live, and the price of TCRV tokens is set at $0.025 (up a huge 150% already). It is predicted to increase by 80x during the presale phase, and 100x after being listed on Uniswap and multiple CEXs.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s5">After the collapse of the FTX Exchange, and the bankruptcy of big banks like Silvergate Capital and Silicon Valley Bank, investors have become skeptical about most crypto projects, including Litecoin (LTC) and Binance (BNB). Hence, they have started to shift toward Tradecurve(TCRV), a new crypto project.</p>
<p class="s5">Investors in these projects have been on the losing side for quite a long time. Due to its novel features and huge growth potential, Tradecurve has been able to attract thousands of investors, who are looking at the project for long-term growth.</p>

Litecoin (LTC) Sees Increase In Trade Volume
<p class="s5">Litecoin (LTC) recently received positive support after the US regulators termed it a commodity. The development has come as a major relief for Litecoin, which is awaiting a halving event. It is also an encouraging development for the Litecoin community as the token is still 79% down from its peak price of $412.96.</p>
<p class="s5">Besides, Litecoin earlier launched its Litecoin Card Program across Europe to increase its adoption rate. This has benefited Litecoin as the number of transactions on the platform has seen an uptick in the past month. Subsequently, the price of Litecoin has witnessed a rise of 9% in the last month. Currently, Litecoin is changing hands at $86.22.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>
Binance (BNB) Accused of Serious Irregularities
<p class="s5">The US Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has filed a lawsuit against Binance(BNB) that could have serious repercussions on the world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency exchange. Binance has been falling on the price chart for the past many days. The trading price of Binancehas fallen by over 1% in the last week.</p>
<p class="s5">As a result, Binance is currently available to trade at $329.15. According to the lawsuit, Binancehas flouted many regulations, including those related to anti-money laundering and KYC. Along with Binance exchange, its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, has also been named in the lawsuit. Market analysts believe if the charges against Binance are proven, the exchange could cease to exist in the market.</p>

Tradecurve (TCRV) Brings New Excitement to the Market
<p class="s5">There are nearly 600 cryptocurrency exchanges worldwide, but none of them are as inclusive as Tradecurve (TCRV), which is a new Web3 trading platform. It is an all-in-one platform that facilitates the trading of cryptocurrencies, OTC derivatives, stocks, bonds, CFDs, Forex, and other commodities, on a single interface.</p>
<p class="s5">Notably, the FX market is the world&rsquo;s largest single market with a daily trading volume of $7.5 trillion. Besides, revenue in the cryptocurrency market is projected to amount to $37.87 billion in 2023. Given such a massive market base, the project has become a favorite investment destination of market bulls.</p>
<p class="s5">Unlike existing crypto exchanges like Coinbase and Binance, which require users to be verified and disclose their personal data, Tradecurve helps people finalize trades without the KYC process. It ensures the anonymity and privacy of users using DeFi capabilities. </p>
<p class="s5">TCRV token holders will receive a range of benefits, such as discounts and staking rewards. The project has begun its presale with an initial price of $0.018. Market pundits forecast that TCRV&rsquo;s price is set to increase by80x by the end of the presale phase. </p>
<p class="s5">Moreover, if you lock your tokens now, you can bag a 100x profit by the end of 2023. Interestingly, Tradecurve&rsquo;s presale growth projections are significantly higher than that of Binance and Huobi. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>With another rate hike universally expected to be announced on Wednesday, will this be the cue for bitcoin and crypto to take another leg down?</p>
A quarter percent rate rise
<p>The next FOMC meeting opens today, when the Federal Reserve board of governors and reserve bank presidents get together to review monetary policy and to decide whether yet another interest rate hike is necessary.</p>
<p>The market is expecting a nailed-on 0.25 basis point rate hike given that the CME Fedwatch tool is showing a 98.9% probability of such a move. Most market analysts, including the Fed itself are predicting one more rise this year, and then the hiking could well be finished for this cycle.</p>
Jobs market too strong
<p>Even though inflation looks to be coming down strongly, and is even approaching the Fed&rsquo;s target of 2%, Chairman Jerome Powell points to the robust labour market as a sign that the battle is not yet won. It would appear that many more businesses need to go to the wall, and Americans need to lose their jobs at a far faster rate in order to stop them spending and supposedly adding upwards pressure to inflation.</p>
The Fed&rsquo;s reactive policy
<p>Powell has his work cut out once again. Keeping a straight face as he announces the Fed&rsquo;s policy for the next few months cannot be easy. History has shown that the Fed is always late with its tightening or easing, and then it always carries on for far too long.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, such is the nature of our debt-based monetary system and that we give an organisation like the Federal Reserve the power to try and manipulate markets in one direction or the other, rather than leaving it to the markets to balance things out.</p>
<p>So, the Fed will press on with another rate hike, and will look to implement one more before the end of the year. In the Fed&rsquo;s view this will be enough to act as a drag on the jobs market and will help to bring inflation down to its target.</p>
Crypto waits for liquidity or a spark
<p>It appears that crypto might have to wait a bit longer before the lifeblood of liquidity comes back into the market and provides the stimulus for the rest of the current bull market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That Bitcoin will be one of the main beneficiaries is very likely. A Bitcoin Spot ETF approval can of course provide the spark that sends crypto on its next leg higher. Be that as it may, in the short term, as rates go higher, the crypto market could have its work cut out to move out of the current doldrums it has been in for the last month.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Japan's Web3 strategy is likely to influence other nations' approaches to embracing the digital revolution.</p>
Corporate Partnership To Expand Metaverse Economic Zone
<p>Japan is set to embrace Web3 technology with the backing of major companies like Fujitsu and Mitsubishi. In a significant partnership, these companies are joining forces to create the necessary infrastructure for an open metaverse and to support Japan's Web3 strategy.</p>
<p>Fujitsu, along with nine other firms, has revealed plans to establish an interoperable metaverse structure known as RYUGUKOKU (TBD). The primary objective of this structure is to expand the Japan Metaverse Economic Zone, enabling a seamless virtual world experience.</p>
Establishing An Interoperable Metaverse&nbsp;
<p>The scope of this initiative goes beyond just entertainment and gaming. It also aims to provide a framework for corporations to leverage Web3 marketing effectively. As part of the project, prominent players such as automobile manufacturer Mitsubishi and global bank Mizuho have also stepped in, highlighting the broad support for the country's Web3 ambitions.</p>
<p>The Japanese government has been actively promoting the adoption of emerging technologies, and Web3 is no exception. By embracing decentralized systems, blockchain, and virtual reality, Japan seeks to position itself at the forefront of technological innovation.</p>
<p>The concept of an open metaverse holds promise in transforming various industries, from entertainment and gaming to commerce and finance. As the world moves towards a more interconnected and digitized future, creating a virtual space where users can interact seamlessly becomes increasingly vital.</p>
Japan&rsquo;s Revised Web3 Policy
<p>The country has already published a whitepaper earlier this year, recommending widespread Web3 adoption. On top of that, the National Tax Agency (NTA) has revised its corporate tax rules to provide a 30% tax exemption to companies issuing cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These web3-friendly policies have raised some questions as the company had tightened regulations in the wake of major hacks like Mt. Gox and Coincheck. Initially poised to become a crypto capital, Japan's regulatory landscape changed drastically after the hacks. It was extremely challenging even to list new tokens on Japanese crypto exchanges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the nation took decisive steps to enhance security measures, requiring the separation of customer and exchange assets, with most exchange assets stored in cold wallets. As a result, when FTX faced a crisis, Japan's regulations proved effective, ensuring the potential return of Japanese customer assets. These lessons from past emergencies have empowered Japan's regulatory approach, making it more knowledgeable and resilient in crypto.</p>
<p>Experts predict that the global Web3 market will witness exponential growth in the coming years, and Japan intends to position itself strategically to harness its benefits fully. As the infrastructure takes shape and the metaverse expands, Japan's Web3 strategy is likely to influence other nations' approaches to embracing the digital revolution.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Russia's bill regarding the digital ruble is now signed into law and will take effect on August 1, 2023.</p>
Russia&rsquo;s CBDC Legislation Finally Signed into Law
<p>Russia moves forward with the launch of its central bank digital currency (CBDC), digital ruble, thus taking a step towards crypto regulation in the country.</p>
<p>The digital ruble legislation bill was first introduced to the lower chamber of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation, the State Duma, in December 2022. The bill passed its first reading in March 2023 and its third final reading on July 11, 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On July 24, Russia&rsquo;s president Vladimir Putin finally signed the CBDC bill into law which is scheduled to come into force on August 1, 2023.</p>
<p>The new law introduces amendments to several articles of the Russian Federation Civil Code. According to the law, the digital ruble will be treated as a means of cashless payment. Russia&rsquo;s central bank will be the main entity responsible for the digital ruble&rsquo;s infrastructure and the safety of the stored assets.</p>
How the Digital Ruble Is Expected to Work
<p>The digital ruble is primarily designed to be a means of payment or a money transfer method and not aimed at investment purposes. Russia&rsquo;s central bank reported that transfers and payments in digital rubles will be free for regular citizens, although corporate clients will have to pay 0.3% of the payment amount.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The authorities have referred to the digital ruble as a &ldquo;new opportunity for citizens and businesses&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s also important to note that the use of the new currency in the country will be completely voluntary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one is going to force anyone into the digital ruble. Its use is absolutely voluntary, it is an additional opportunity for people: they can use it if they want to.&rdquo; &ndash; said the governor of Bank of Russia, Elvira Nabiullina.</p>

<p>The government authorities previously reported that trials of the CBDC were to be run in collaboration with 13 local banks that have passed the necessary technical stages of preparation. The digital ruble wallet and transfers should be available in any of the Russian banks&rsquo; mobile apps, although all the operations will be carried out by the Central Bank itself.</p>
<p>The Bank of Russia highlights the reliability, security, and efficiency of the CBDC operations thanks to their centralized regulation.</p>
<p>Olga Skorobogatova, the Bank of Russia&rsquo;s deputy governor, compared the digital ruble to other digital assets:</p>

<p> "the digital ruble is not a cryptocurrency or a stablecoin, where either there is no issuer, or it is not clear who it is."</p>

<p>The mass adoption of the digital ruble in Russia is expected in 2025-2027. The CBDC could be a way to avoid sanctions against Russia imposed by the West when making cross-border payments. It could also be part of the effort to regulate the use of digital assets in the country.</p>

<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Binance rolls out new intermediate-level courses.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">The intermediate tract will consist of six courses, including DeFi and NFTs.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Learners receive an NFT certificate upon completion of each course.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the launch of its successful beginner-level program in late 2022, Binance Academy, the education arm of the world&rsquo;s leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance, announced the launch of the free-to-learn intermediate-level courses this Tuesday. The courses aim to extend learning about Web 3 and crypto fundamentals and provide learners with an NFT certificate upon completion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The launch of the intermediate track bonds well with Binance&rsquo;s goal of &ldquo;making [crypto] education accessible to all&rdquo;, as Binance co-founder and Chief Marketing Officer Yi He explained.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the industry leader, we are committed to driving innovation not just through our technology but also by making education accessible to all,&rdquo; He said. &ldquo;The Web3 sector is maturing rapidly. That&rsquo;s why we think it&rsquo;s important to equip people with the necessary knowledge - a mission we take to heart at Binance Academy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The intermediate-level courses will include a series of six courses (similar to the beginner track) expounding knowledge on blockchain, cryptocurrencies, DApps, DeFi, NFTs, and crypto trading. Each course will include five lessons designed to be completed within 60 to 90 minutes, with engaging quizzes at the end of each lesson.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far, Binance Academy has launched the first intermediate course &ndash; Blockchain Deep Dive &ndash; an online course that spans advanced concepts of blockchain, crypto, and Web3 information for the crypto-curious,&nbsp; delivering it in a structured curriculum. The course is currently available in English, with plans to launch the remaining five courses in multiple languages over the coming months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every learner will be eligible to receive an NFT certificate upon completing each of the six courses, which they can share on their resumes or social profiles.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Learners receive an NFT certificate upon completion of each course.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the launch of its successful beginner-level program in late 2022, Binance Academy, the education arm of the world&rsquo;s leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance, announced the launch of the free-to-learn intermediate-level courses this Tuesday. The courses aim to extend learning about Web 3 and crypto fundamentals and provide learners with an NFT certificate upon completion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The launch of the intermediate track bonds well with Binance&rsquo;s goal of &ldquo;making [crypto] education accessible to all&rdquo;, as Binance co-founder and Chief Marketing Officer Yi He explained.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the industry leader, we are committed to driving innovation not just through our technology but also by making education accessible to all,&rdquo; He said. &ldquo;The Web3 sector is maturing rapidly. That&rsquo;s why we think it&rsquo;s important to equip people with the necessary knowledge - a mission we take to heart at Binance Academy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The intermediate-level courses will include a series of six courses (similar to the beginner track) expounding knowledge on blockchain, cryptocurrencies, DApps, DeFi, NFTs, and crypto trading. Each course will include five lessons designed to be completed within 60 to 90 minutes, with engaging quizzes at the end of each lesson.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far, Binance Academy has launched the first intermediate course &ndash; Blockchain Deep Dive &ndash; an online course that spans advanced concepts of blockchain, crypto, and Web3 information for the crypto-curious,&nbsp; delivering it in a structured curriculum. The course is currently available in English, with plans to launch the remaining five courses in multiple languages over the coming months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every learner will be eligible to receive an NFT certificate upon completing each of the six courses, which they can share on their resumes or social profiles.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Changpeng Zhao and other defendants associated with the Binance crypto exchange plan to appeal to the court to dismiss a lawsuit from the United States commodities regulator.</p>
Binance&rsquo;s Appeal To Dismiss
<p>Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) and its former Chief Compliance Officer Samuel Lim have revealed that they will be filing motions with the court seeking permission to dismiss a prior complaint by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the July 24 filing to the Illinois District Court, the defendants, which consist of multiple entities from the Binance ecosystem, have claimed that they will be filing two separate motions to counter the CFTC&rsquo;s complaint and appeal for its dismissal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CFTC's lawsuit against Binance was filed on March 27, 2023, and the defendants are required to respond latest by July 27, 2023. In its latest filing, the Foreign Binance Entities, which includes CZ, has revealed intentions to file a joint Motion to Dismiss, while Samuel Lim plans to file a separate motion and incorporate parts of the motion filed by the other defendants.</p>
Binance Seeks To Exceed Page Limit Rule
<p>The defendants are also seeking to exceed the 15-page limit rule on the brief as they claim that they made every effort to adhere to this limit but contend that due to the intricacy of the CFTC's complaint and the multiple arguments they wish to present, their Memoranda of Law is likely to surpass the given page restriction.</p>
<p>The filing reads,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Given the complexity of the CFTC&rsquo;s Complaint and the number of arguments Defendants anticipate making in support of their Motions to Dismiss, Defendants anticipate that their Memoranda of Law in support of the two motions will exceed the fifteen-page limits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In their motion, the defendants requested the court's permission to collectively use up to 50 pages for both Memoranda of Law. This proposed limit is 25 pages less than what the defendants would be entitled to under Local Rule 7.1 if each of them separately moved to dismiss the CFTC's complaint.&nbsp;</p>
CFTC&rsquo;s Complaint
<p>Notably, the CFTC has agreed not to oppose this request, as confirmed by discussions between both parties' counsels. While the court has yet to issue a ruling on their motion, the cooperation from the CFTC's counsel indicates a willingness to accommodate the defendants' request.</p>
<p>The regulatory body had accused Binance and Zhao of violating derivatives regulations and engaging in unregistered trading activities in the United States. The complaint alleged that Binance had strategically expanded its US presence despite publicly claiming to block or restrict access for US customers. CZ responded to the lawsuit, expressing surprise and disappointment, stating that it had been actively cooperating with the agency for over two years.</p>
<p>As the July 27 deadline for the response approaches, market participants are keenly observing the developments in this case, as its outcome may have significant implications for the cryptocurrency industry.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Middle Eastern crypto exchange Rain, backed by Coinbase, announced that its Abu Dhabi unit secured a license to offer crypto brokerage and custody services in the UAE.</p>
<p>According to reports by Reuters, Rain, a Middle Eastern crypto exchange based in Bahrain, and backed by Coinbase, announced today its Abu Dhabi unit secured a &ldquo;license to operate a virtual assets brokerage and custody service for clients in the United Arab Emirates.&rdquo;</p>
Rain Expands Offerings into UAE
<p>Obtaining the license means that Rain&rsquo;s unit based in the Abu Dhabi Global Market financial free zone may now offer institutional and a limited number of retail clients in the UAE services to buy, sell, and store their virtual assets.</p>
<p>Yehia Badawy, Rain&rsquo;s co-founder, said in an interview with Reuters that the license further allows the exchange to open a bank account in the UAE and permits its clients in the region to fund their own accounts provided they use a local payment network.</p>
<p>Badawy noted that local asset managers have been reluctant to work with crypto firms who do not have domestic operating licenses but said they would now confidently deal with such firms. He further stated:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can capture more demand from institutional investors using this licence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Badawy founded Rain with three partners in 2017 with the backing and support of venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins and Coinbase Ventures.</p>
<p>Rain has seen significant growth after it raised $110 million in a Series B funding round in 2022, placing the firm&rsquo;s value at $500 million. The firm indicated that the funds were earmarked for regional expansion.</p>
Growing Number of Crypto Firms Attracted to UAE
<p>The current crisis and regulatory uncertainty in the US prompted many crypto-related firms to explore other regions to expand to, and the UAE appears to be a popular option.</p>
<p>Binance recently said it was considering a move to Dubai due to the UAE&rsquo;s pro-crypto stance and policies. Alex Chehade, Binance Dubai&rsquo;s General Manager, said the region is a prime destination for crypto businesses.</p>
<p>The US-based crypto exchange Gemini also said it would &ldquo;soon&rdquo; start the process of obtaining a crypto service license for customers in the UAE. Gemini cited &ldquo;hostility and [a] lack of clarity&rdquo; on US regulations as motivation for its decision.</p>
<p>Coinbase also believes that the UAE is an attractive region for establishing its business amid ongoing difficulties with US regulators. The exchange expressed its interest in establishing an international hub in the UAE with its CEO Brian Armstrong, who believes that the country is well positioned to expand and serve the market in Africa, Asia, and, naturally, the Middle East. Armstrong also praised the country for its &ldquo;forward-thinking&rdquo; approach to crypto regulation.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The highly controversial Arkham Intel Exchange has approved its first-ever bounty hunt, with crypto sleuths set to go after crypto wallets belonging to Terra co-founder Do Kwon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Do Kwon currently languishing in a Montenegrin jail, crypto users have long been trying to seek out any information regarding his crypto wallets.&nbsp;</p>
&ldquo;Deanonymizing The Blockchain&rdquo;
<p>The Arkham Intel Exchange is a highly controversial platform, acting as a marketplace that facilitates the trading of on-chain data. The platform recently approved its first-ever bounty submission after two crypto sleuths found evidence of crypto wallets belonging to Do Kwon. An anonymous user, along with a pseudo-anonymous Twitter user going by the name of @ErgoBTC, were paid around 9500 ARKM tokens, worth around $5000 for their submission.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Arkham Intel Exchange now has its first approved submission: new evidence of wallets owned by Do Kwon / Terraform Labs. An anonymous on-chain sleuth and @ErgoBTC were the successful bounty hunters.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>It further added,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Expanded labels for the LFG BTC address activity after running off with funds intended for the defense of the UST depeg have been added to Arkham as a part of their bounty program.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to Arkham Intel, the anonymous user and Ergo sent the platform considerable evidence they had found wallets owned by Do Kwon and Terra. Ergo stated this evidence contradicts public statements made by Terra that it holds only one Luna Foundation Guard wallet. Luna Foundation Guard stated that 80,081 BTC, which comprised over 99% of its reserves, had exited the fund. LFG had claimed that the reason behind the sale of the crypto asset was to shore up and support the overall health of the Terra ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
ErgoBTC&rsquo;s Findings&nbsp;
<p>Ergo shared further details about his research, which was first made public in October when the Luna Foundation Guard claimed it had only one Bitcoin wallet containing 313 BTC. Ergo had written at the time,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;While it may be true that this is the only formally &lsquo;declared&rsquo; wallet controlled by the LFG, they seem to have failed to account for the trail of bread crumbs left by the change outputs used to fund their new declared wallet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The crypto sleuth continued to track the funds over the next few months and noted that they were moving even after Do Kwon&rsquo;s arrest in March.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kwon may have been rolled up for faking a passport. But LFG and the BTC are still moving.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wallet being tracked has been officially christened &ldquo;Terraform Labs&rdquo; on the Arkham Intel Exchange and currently holds around $160 million worth of crypto, out of which around $153 million is in Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>
The Arkham Intel Exchange&nbsp;
<p>The Arkham Intel Exchange was launched on the 10th of July to generally negative reactions by members of the crypto space, with most describing it as a glorified snitching service. Many in the crypto space have also stated that the platform could be used to dox innocent individuals. Users on the platform can place bounties for information related to blockchain transactions, which would then be released to the public within 90 days following approval from the platform. Going by this timeline, information about the Do Kwon and Terra wallets could be available in the public domain sometime in October.&nbsp;</p>
The Terra Collapse&nbsp;
<p>The Terra collapse was one of the most crippling events in the history of crypto when the collapse of its algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD and its cryptocurrency LUNA triggered chaos in the market. Following TerraUSD&rsquo;s de-pegging and the ecosystem&rsquo;s collapse, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged Do Kwon with securities violations for selling unregistered transactions of crypto asset securities. He was also charged for failing to provide truthful disclosures and providing investors with misleading information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kwon&rsquo;s whereabouts were unknown until March 2023, when he was apprehended by authorities in Montenegro and was sentenced to four months in prison for traveling using forged travel papers. Several other individuals connected to Terra are also under investigation by authorities in South Korea. Recently, co-founder Hin Hyun-seong had his first hearing for charges related to illegal profits from the sale of LUNA tokens.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried has agreed to a gag order that prevents him from publicly discussing his case after prosecutors alleged he was discrediting their witness, Caroline Ellison.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bankman-Fried had come under fire for conducting an interview with the New York Times, which prosecutors have claimed amounts to witness tampering.&nbsp;</p>
Bail Status In Jeopardy&nbsp;
<p>The gag order prevents the FTX founder from making any public statements related to the lawsuit, FTX, and the people involved with the lawsuit. Judge Lewis Kaplan, who is presiding over the case, will make a ruling on whether the gag order is required at the upcoming hearing for the lawsuit, scheduled on the 26th of July. The judge will also look at the &ldquo;adequacy and continuation&rdquo; of Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s bail, suggesting that his current bail status could be in jeopardy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proposed order bans Bankman-Fried and others associated with the lawsuit from discussing anything with the press that could interfere with a fair trial. This includes statements regarding the credibility of witnesses, information that is not admissible during the trial, and any statement or opinion about the case that could influence the public. The order also extends to attorneys. However, it does not prevent Bankman-Fried from asserting his innocence.&nbsp;</p>
The New York Times Story&nbsp;
<p>Bankman-Fried came under criticism following a story published in the New York Times. The story&rsquo;s focus was Caroline Ellison, the CEO of Alameda Research, and talked about writings found in her personal journals and Google Docs, appearing to show her ambivalence about her relationship with SBF and role at FTX. These were written by Ellison when she was the head of Alameda Research and before the collapse of FTX. She also talked about her struggles when it came to leading Alameda, which she described as &ldquo;overwhelming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Following the story, federal prosecutors launched a scathing attack on SBF, accusing him of leaking stories to newspapers and showing their witness in poor light. They also described it as a malicious effort to influence the jury pool toward the witness.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In addition to tainting the jury pool, the effect, if not the intent, of the defendant&rsquo;s conduct is not only to harass Ellison but also to deter other potential trial witnesses from testifying.&rdquo;</p>

Nothing Malicious&nbsp;
<p>Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s lawyers confirmed in a letter sent to Judge Kaplan that the former FTX CEO had met with reporters, adding that he gave them Ellison&rsquo;s documents. However, they denied all allegations of witness tampering as alleged by the prosecution. Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s lawyers argued that the prosecution&rsquo;s allegations were unfounded and that he had no malicious intention when he shared the documents with reporters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;[SBF] did not violate the protective order in this case, nor did he violate his bail conditions, nor did he violate any law or rule.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Additionally, the defense stated that Bankman-Fried would agree to the gag order and refrain from discussing or making public statements regarding the case. However, they argued that the gag order should also apply to the prosecution, along with all witnesses, including current FTX CEO John Ray. Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s lawyers argued that Ray had publicly vilified and attacked their client and continues to portray him as a villain, despite the case&rsquo;s ongoing status.&nbsp;</p>
Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s House Arrest&nbsp;
<p>Bankman-Fried has already been summoned by Judge Kaplan following the accusations, with the judge skeptical regarding his bail conditions. He has already warned Kaplan has already warned SBF that he could end up going back to jail if he did not curtail his use of VPN programs and encrypted messaging apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The former CEO is under house arrest at his parent&rsquo;s home in California as part of a $250 million bail package. However, the bail conditions have already been tightened twice. Visitors are now required to hand over their devices to a guard at the front door. Additionally, Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s internet usage is heavily monitored, and he is banned from using certain encrypted applications and contacting witnesses.

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried has agreed to a gag order that prevents him from publicly discussing his case after prosecutors alleged he was discrediting their witness, Caroline Ellison.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bankman-Fried had come under fire for conducting an interview with the New York Times, which prosecutors have claimed amounts to witness tampering.&nbsp;</p>
Bail Status In Jeopardy&nbsp;
<p>The gag order prevents the FTX founder from making any public statements related to the lawsuit, FTX, and the people involved with the lawsuit. Judge Lewis Kaplan, who is presiding over the case, will make a ruling on whether the gag order is required at the upcoming hearing for the lawsuit, scheduled on the 26th of July. The judge will also look at the &ldquo;adequacy and continuation&rdquo; of Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s bail, suggesting that his current bail status could be in jeopardy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proposed order bans Bankman-Fried and others associated with the lawsuit from discussing anything with the press that could interfere with a fair trial. This includes statements regarding the credibility of witnesses, information that is not admissible during the trial, and any statement or opinion about the case that could influence the public. The order also extends to attorneys. However, it does not prevent Bankman-Fried from asserting his innocence.&nbsp;</p>
The New York Times Story&nbsp;
<p>Bankman-Fried came under criticism following a story published in the New York Times. The story&rsquo;s focus was Caroline Ellison, the CEO of Alameda Research, and talked about writings found in her personal journals and Google Docs, appearing to show her ambivalence about her relationship with SBF and role at FTX. These were written by Ellison when she was the head of Alameda Research and before the collapse of FTX. She also talked about her struggles when it came to leading Alameda, which she described as &ldquo;overwhelming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Following the story, federal prosecutors launched a scathing attack on SBF, accusing him of leaking stories to newspapers and showing their witness in poor light. They also described it as a malicious effort to influence the jury pool toward the witness.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In addition to tainting the jury pool, the effect, if not the intent, of the defendant&rsquo;s conduct is not only to harass Ellison but also to deter other potential trial witnesses from testifying.&rdquo;</p>

Nothing Malicious&nbsp;
<p>Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s lawyers confirmed in a letter sent to Judge Kaplan that the former FTX CEO had met with reporters, adding that he gave them Ellison&rsquo;s documents. However, they denied all allegations of witness tampering as alleged by the prosecution. Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s lawyers argued that the prosecution&rsquo;s allegations were unfounded and that he had no malicious intention when he shared the documents with reporters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;[SBF] did not violate the protective order in this case, nor did he violate his bail conditions, nor did he violate any law or rule.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Additionally, the defense stated that Bankman-Fried would agree to the gag order and refrain from discussing or making public statements regarding the case. However, they argued that the gag order should also apply to the prosecution, along with all witnesses, including current FTX CEO John Ray. Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s lawyers argued that Ray had publicly vilified and attacked their client and continues to portray him as a villain, despite the case&rsquo;s ongoing status.&nbsp;</p>
Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s House Arrest&nbsp;
<p>Bankman-Fried has already been summoned by Judge Kaplan following the accusations, with the judge skeptical regarding his bail conditions. He has already warned Kaplan has already warned SBF that he could end up going back to jail if he did not curtail his use of VPN programs and encrypted messaging apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The former CEO is under house arrest at his parent&rsquo;s home in California as part of a $250 million bail package. However, the bail conditions have already been tightened twice. Visitors are now required to hand over their devices to a guard at the front door. Additionally, Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s internet usage is heavily monitored, and he is banned from using certain encrypted applications and contacting witnesses. The second condition was imposed after he messaged a potential witness and emailed John Ray.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In its newest scare tactic, the SEC alleged Binance.US inflated its trading volumes through a practice known as &ldquo;wash trading.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has repeatedly increased the regulatory pressure against Binance.US. Binance has become the subject of the US&rsquo;s efforts to eliminate crypto exchanges it deems to have acted improperly.</p>
SEC: Binance.US Engaged in &ldquo;Wash Trading&rdquo;
<p>US regulatory action this time comes as the SEC accused Binance&rsquo;s US arm, Binance.US, of inflating its trading volumes &ndash; a practice known as &ldquo;wash trading.&rdquo; The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) first reported the news and said some of the exchange&rsquo;s crypto trading was a &ldquo;mirage&rdquo;, according to SEC.</p>
<p>Most accusations levelled against the exchange and its CEO, Changpeng &lsquo;CZ&rsquo; Zhao, came after the SEC sued Binance, Binance.US, and CZ. In its claims against the exchange, the SEC alleged that trading volumes on Binance.US were inflated by a firm owned by Zhao.</p>
<p>The WSJ report says the securities agency alleges that Binance.US inflated trading volumes &ldquo;by using dozens of user accounts held by Sigma Chain, a Swiss trading company controlled by Zhao.&rdquo; The WSJ also cites an academic report and boldly claims that over 70% of trading volume on crypto exchanges is derived from wash trading.</p>
<p>Binance.US filed a lawsuit against the SEC for its claims of improper handling of customer funds and said the SEC were &ldquo;misleading: the public in its ongoing cases. The SEC accused Binance and CZ of commingling customer assets in a press release.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Given that Changpeng Zhao and Binance have control of the platforms&rsquo; customers&rsquo; assets and have been able to commingle customer assets or divert customer assets as they please, as we have alleged, these prohibitions are essential to protecting investor assets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;A spokesperson addressed the SEC&rsquo;s allegations of wash trading, saying they are &ldquo;entirely unfounded.&rdquo; The WSJ further reports the spokesperson said the claims are &ldquo;based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the facts and a misapplication of the relevant law.&rdquo;</p>
Binance.US Feels the Pressure
<p>The exchange naturally has felt the effects of the SEC&rsquo;s endless lawsuits and allegations. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Recent reports indicated Binance&rsquo;s US affiliate laid off some of its staff following the agency&rsquo;s actions.</p>
Binance Seeks Dismissal of CFTC Complaint
<p>In a July 24 report, news agency Reuters said that Binance and its CEO are &ldquo;planning to seek dismissal of a Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) complaint accusing the crypto exchange of violating the Commodity Exchange Act and certain related federal regulations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Binance has until July 27 to submit its response to the CFTC&rsquo;s complaint and will reportedly seek a dismissal. In March, the CFTC revealed it was suing Binance and its CEO, accusing the exchange of trading on its own platform and CZ of indulging in insider trading.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The United States Federal Reserve has officially launched its new instant payment system dubbed FedNow.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The launch comes as the Federal Reserve looks to modernize and streamline the United States&rsquo; payment system. Research on financial systems has been ongoing since 2021 FedNow enables instant payment between users and banks and boasts of its 24/7/365 operations. Users will have full access to their funds and also do not have to pay anything to join the service. The Federal Reserve expects the service to speed up the flow of money throughout the country.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">According to the FedNow&rsquo;s own website, the initial launch will simply focus on &ldquo;core clearing and settlement capabilities&rdquo; and additional features will be launched in phases, depending on industry demands and changes in technology. As more banks and credit unions adopt the service, users and businesses can expect more benefits. As of writing, early adopters of the service include big banks like JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and BNY Mellon.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">While this development is of course a net positive for everyday users, the launch of FedNow raises a glaring question, especially regarding the United States&rsquo; own financial system. There are already existing systems like Venmo, Paypal or even The Clearing House&rsquo;s Real-Time Payments (RTP) Network that enable instant payments. So the question becomes what is FedNow really for? And what comes next after FedNow? </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Although the Federal Reserve has said that FedNow will not be used as a springboard to the launch of the United States&rsquo; own central bank digital currency (CBDC), this has not stopped the cryptocurrency community from speculating and worrying. If the Federal Reserve, and by extension the United States government, is serious about digital currencies, then it should also relax the current hostile environment to cryptocurrency enablked by none other than the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The SEC, at the helm of Gary Gensler, has been on a warpath against cryptocurrency platforms with its unflinching stance that all crypto assets (save for Bitcoin) are securities.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Notably, there is the recent issue of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) bloc developing its own CBDC patently as a rival to the U.S. dollar. The United States is currently at a crossroads and the next big move after FedNow will be crucial not just to the everyday user but the entire world&rsquo;s monetary system.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">In a recent statement, the SEC claimed that the recent Ripple ruling was incorrect, while disclosing that it has already decided and is currently moving in to post an appeal.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">There has been some intertwining contexts with latest legal fracas with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which involves Terraform Labs and its co-founder, Do Kwon.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Notably, the SEC's recent motion against Terraform Labs has revived discussions around the landmark Ripple Labs case, signaling a possible appeal on the horizon.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Institutional vs. Retail: Divergent Perspectives</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">In the Ripple Labs case, the court determined that Ripple's XRP token sales to institutional investors breached SEC rules. However, the judge ruled that Ripple's offerings to retail investors on exchanges didn't infringe on these same regulations. This bifurcation of institutional and retail sales was broadly seen as a victory for the crypto industry.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In a stark departure from this view, the SEC, in its most recent filing against Terraform Labs and Kwon, voiced its disapproval. The agency stated:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"The decision creates an artificial distinction between the expectations of sophisticated institutional and retail investors."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">In the SEC's view, the ruling reformulates the decades-old Howey Test, a metric used to identify when assets are securities, transforming it into a more subjective standard. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Accordingly, the SEC requested that the court reject this part of the Ripple decision and hinted at a possible appeal in the Ripple case.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Ripple Ruling's Impact on Terraform Labs Lawsuit</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Ripple ruling has become a crucial reference in the ongoing lawsuit against Terraform Labs and Kwon. Their legal representatives cited the Ripple decision in their dismissal motion, arguing that it "confirms the legal insufficiency of the SEC&rsquo;s argument."</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">They were referring to the SEC's assertion that certain tokens, including the ill-fated TerraUSD stablecoin, were securities due to their method of sale.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">However, the SEC has doubled down on its accusations that Terraform Labs and Kwon offered and sold unregistered securities as part of a fraudulent scheme, causing a loss of at least $40 billion in market value. The SEC also underscored that the institutional investor aspect of the Ripple ruling supports its case against Terraform Labs.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The SEC notes that institutional buyers in such a case (such as trading firms that purchased crypto assets from Terraform Labs with no restrictions on resale) purchased ostensibly on the reason that the assets were an investment on top of Terraform Lab's initiatives.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The legal entanglements involving the SEC, Ripple Labs, and now Terraform Labs, highlightts the evolving dynamics between the emerging crypto industry and established securities regulations. The nuanced interpretation of these regulations in relation to cryptocurrencies like XRP and TerraUSD has far-reaching implications for the industry. How these cases play out in the courts will set precedents that could shape the crypto landscape for years to come.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">SEC's Prospective Appeal</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The SEC's recent motion reveals its plan to challenge the federal court ruling in favor of Ripple Labs. U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres upheld that nearly half of Ripple's XRP sales did not contravene investor-protection laws. This verdict sparked hope among other defendants embroiled in disputes with the SEC regarding their cryptocurrency sales, which, according to the SEC, often constitute illegally sold securities. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This court ruling has become a beacon of hope for defendants like Do Kwon, co-founder of Terraform Labs. Kwon, currently serving time in prison, faces an SEC lawsuit alleging fraudulent activities and various legal infringements. The lawsuit was filed in February in Manhattan federal court. In light of the recent Ripple Labs ruling, Kwon's defense is employing it as a basis to refute the SEC's accusations. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Precedent in Flux</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Ripple&rsquo;s CEO Brad Garlinghouse blasted the SEC, accusing it of creating a &ldquo;mess&rdquo; by declaring itself the &ldquo;cop on the crypto beat when it had no legal jurisdiction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse took to Twitter today to defend Judge Torres&rsquo; recent decision, which declared that Ripple&rsquo;s sale of its XRP token did not constitute a sale of securities.</p>
<p>Ripple&rsquo;s chief further blamed the SEC for creating the &ldquo;mess&rdquo; surrounding crypto regulation when it had no right to do so.</p>
Garlinghouse Speaks Out Against SEC
<p>Ripple&rsquo;s partial victory against the SEC has been celebrated by most of the industry but has seen some backlash from the naysayers. Judge Analisa Torres ruled on July 13 the XRP token, concerning retail sales on digital asset exchanges, is not necessarily a security. Torres, however, did rule that XRP qualifies as a security under the Howey Test when sold to institutional investors.</p>
<p>At the time of the ruling, Garlinghouse commented that institutional sale represents &ldquo;the smallest piece&rdquo; of the suit and believes if the SEC decides to appeal the decision regarding retail sales, it would only &ldquo;solidify&rdquo; Torres&rsquo; decision. Garlinghouse further labelled the SEC a &ldquo;bully&rdquo; for targeting &ldquo;weak players&rdquo; in the industry without the necessary resources to build a strong defence.</p>
<p>The Ripple CEO continued his criticism of the agency in defence to retail consumers. He said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;An important topic has come up about protecting retail. The SEC created this mess by proclaiming it was the cop on the crypto beat when it had no legal jurisdiction Where&rsquo;s that gotten us? Consumers left holding the bag in bankruptcy court while the SEC holds press conferences.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the same thread, Garlinghouse defended Judge Torres&rsquo; application of the law, emphasizing &ldquo;legislation &ndash; not more regulation by enforcement &ndash; is the only way to provide clear rules and protect retail.&rdquo;</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">It&rsquo;s absurd to blame a Judge for faithfully applying the law. We all know legislation &ndash; not more regulation by enforcement &ndash; is the only way forward to provide clear rules and protect retail. Glad to see more members of Congress like @RepRitchie, @PatrickMcHenry champion this.</p>

SEC May Appeal Decision But Will Take Years
<p>While it has not clearly stated it would appeal Torres&rsquo; ruling, the SEC did hint at the possibility.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported that disgraced Terraform Labs co-founder, Do Kwon is trying to use the landmark ruling as precedence in his own battle against the securities agency. In a motion involving Kwon, the SEC urged the presiding judge not to seek guidance from the Ripple ruling. The SEC said Judge Torres&rsquo; decision &ldquo;adds baseless requirements&rdquo; to the Howey Test and stated there would be a &ldquo;further review&rdquo; of the ruling.</p>
<p>Prominent crypto and pro-Ripple lawyer John Deaton clarified the implications of a possible appeal by the SEC.</p>
<p>Deaton said on Twitter that he does not view a potential appeal as a setback to the industry.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">An appeal is not even close to be a setback. First, it will be two years from now before a decision is issued by the 2nd Circuit, if it&rsquo;s appealed. The Torres Decision is the law until then - at least in the 2nd Circuit. Second, even if the 2nd Circuit said Torres was wrong&hellip; https://t.co/GzW31D9edQ</p>

<p>Mr Deaton explained that a possible SEC appeal would take at least two years to come to fruition and said that until such a decision is revealed, Judge Torres&rsquo; ruling remains the law.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ripple&rsquo;s CEO Brad Garlinghouse blasted the SEC, accusing it of creating a &ldquo;mess&rdquo; by declaring itself the &ldquo;cop on the crypto beat when it had no legal jurisdiction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse took to Twitter today to defend Judge Torres&rsquo; recent decision, which declared that Ripple&rsquo;s sale of its XRP token did not constitute a sale of securities.</p>
<p>Ripple&rsquo;s chief further blamed the SEC for creating the &ldquo;mess&rdquo; surrounding crypto regulation when it had no right to do so.</p>
Garlinghouse Speaks Out Against SEC
<p>Ripple&rsquo;s partial victory against the SEC has been celebrated by most of the industry but has seen some backlash from the naysayers. Judge Analisa Torres ruled on July 13 the XRP token, concerning retail sales on digital asset exchanges, is not necessarily a security. Torres, however, did rule that XRP qualifies as a security under the Howey Test when sold to institutional investors.</p>
<p>At the time of the ruling, Garlinghouse commented that institutional sale represents &ldquo;the smallest piece&rdquo; of the suit and believes if the SEC decides to appeal the decision regarding retail sales, it would only &ldquo;solidify&rdquo; Torres&rsquo; decision. Garlinghouse further labelled the SEC a &ldquo;bully&rdquo; for targeting &ldquo;weak players&rdquo; in the industry without the necessary resources to build a strong defence.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In response to the rollout of the Worldcoin crypto services, Vitalik Buterin published a detailed essay about biometric proof of personhood.</p>
Worldcoin&rsquo;s Mission to Help Distinguish Humans from AI Bots Online
<p>The CEO of OpenAI Sam Altman together with Alex Blania founded Worldcoin over three years ago. The main idea behind the project is to present a solution which can effectively verify human identity online without violating users&rsquo; privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With AI technology developing extremely rapidly in the latest months, many believe that soon it&rsquo;s going to take over lots of human jobs leaving thousands unemployed. It might also get to the point where it will become very difficult to tell the difference between humans and AI bots online.</p>
<p>Worldcoin offers a digital proof of personhood called World ID. In order to get a World ID, one needs to use an Orb, a sophisticated biometric verification device which scans users&rsquo; irises to verify that they&rsquo;re human.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Worldcoin also confirmed that it plans to create an AI-funded Universal Basic Income (UBI) service, thus helping to combat income inequality. Users in the countries &ldquo;where laws allow&rdquo; should be able to receive the Worldcoin digital currency (WLD) for simply being human.&nbsp;</p>
Worldcoin Starts the Rollout of Its Services&nbsp;
<p>On July 24, Worldcoin published a letter from cofounders on its website announcing the official launch of the product. One can access the Worldcoin services via World App, the company&rsquo;s owned crypto wallet which is already available on iOS and Android. However, to get verified for World ID, it&rsquo;s also required to visit an Orb, the eyeball-scanning device which is not globally distributed yet.</p>
<p>Over 2 million people already signed up for World ID during the project&rsquo;s Beta phase. Numerous crypto exchange platforms such as Binance, OKX, and Huobi have already confirmed the listing of the Worldcoin&rsquo;s token.</p>
Vitalik Buterin Describes Potential Risks of the Worldcoin&rsquo;s Identity Verification System
<p>On the same day of Worldcoin&rsquo;s launch, the Ethereum network cofounder Vitalik Buterin published an extensive blog post about biometric proof of personhood in general and World ID in particular.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Buterin, proof of personhood solutions are crucial as they help solve &ldquo;a lot of anti-spam and anti-concentration-of-power problems&rdquo; as well as increase privacy and reduce dependence on centralized authorities. Many apps today use government-backed identity systems such as state IDs or credit cards, which inevitably intrude on users&rsquo; privacy.</p>
<p>However, digital identity verification solutions have their issues as well. Buterin identifies at least four major risks with Worldcoin&rsquo;s construction: privacy, accessibility, centralization, and security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vitalik Buterin then compares World ID to other types of identity verification and concludes that there is no ideal form of proof of personhood:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I definitely do not envy the people attempting the task, and it will likely take years to find a formula that works. The concept of proof-of-personhood in principle seems very valuable, and while the various implementations have their risks, not having any proof-of-personhood at all has its risks too&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
