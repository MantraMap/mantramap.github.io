<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitcoin-argentina-javier-milei-wins-primaries/">Bitcoin Price Spikes in Argentina After Pro-BTC Presidential Candidate Wins Primaries</a></p>
<p>The price of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> has hit a new record in Argentina after Bitcoin proponent and presidential candidate Javier Milei won the election primaries. At a time when the price of the king coin and other cryptocurrencies are struggling, Bitcoin has recorded new gains in Argentina. The king coin jumped 21% to 10.2 million ARS (Argentine Peso) from 8.4 million ARS.</p>
<p>The spike happened in less than an hour on August 14. However, Bitcoin has corrected since then and is trading at 9.9 million ARS. Nevertheless, BTC has recorded impressive growth against the Argentine Peso since late last year. CoinGecko data has Bitcoin rising 210% against the ARS since August 17 last year.</p>
<p>The recent spike reflects Bitcoin enthusiast Milei’s win. The candidate has previously said that Bitcoin is the people’s reaction against what he calls “central bank scammers”. In addition, Milei has an anti-fiat currency stance as he believes it grants politicians the power to scam Argentines with inflation.</p>
<p>Argentines seem interested in this position, especially since the country is facing heavy inflation at 116%. Some analysts predict it could hit 142%. Interestingly, the central bank of Argentina’s prediction is 148.9%.</p>
<p>Milei won 84% of the votes at the primaries conducted by his party, “La Libertad Avanza” (Freedom Advances). Furthermore, Milei scored 30.73% of the total votes, with the “Unidos por la Patria” (United for the Homeland) coalition and the “Juntos por el Cambio” (Together for Change) party scoring 26.84% and 28.14%, respectively.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin and Crypto in Argentina</h2>
<p>Although Milei is pro-Bitcoin, the politician does not think Bitcoin should be legal tender. He does not believe that Argentina should follow the route El Salvador did when it made Bitcoin legal tender in 2021. Milei’s plan is to “ dollarize” the economy, suggesting that Argentina should use the US dollar.</p>
<p>In January, Coinspeaker <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/brazil-argentina-regional-currency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported </a>that Argentina and Brazil are collaborating to launch a common currency. Both countries plan to use the new currency to strengthen their economic and trade relationship while lowering their dependence on the US dollar. This plan is in direct contradiction with Milei’s dollarization agenda if he does become president after the elections in October.</p>
<p>Back in May, Argentina’s central bank forbade payment providers from supporting crypto transactions. The central bank said in a <a href="https://bcra.gob.ar/Noticias/proveedores-servicio-pago-no-pueden-operar-criptoactivos.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a> that financial institutions should not facilitate any transactions that involve unregulated crypto assets, The ban affects all tokens and coins since Argentina does not regulate cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>In a Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/CamaraFintechAr/status/1654505628918771716?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thread</a>, the Argentine Chamber of Fintech rejected the central bank’s decree. According to the Chamber of Fintech, such rules only hinder progress and disrupt the free choice of Argentines “who seek alternatives to protect their purchasing power in a context of accelerated inflation”. The Chamber also criticized the central bank for not creating constructive dialogue between stakeholders in the private and public sectors. In addition, they noted that it is important to analyze the sector&#8217;s impact, regarding jobs, innovation, and knowledge exportation, before making a blanket decision like a ban.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/adyen-shares-fall-h1-performance/">Adyen Shares Fall after Disappointing H1 Performance</a></p>
<p>European payments powerhouse <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/adyen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adyen NV</a> (AMS: ADYEN) witnessed a significant drop of nearly 28% in its shares earlier in the day following the release of its first-half 2023 performance results. The company, often seen as a strong competitor to the US payment giant <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/stripe/">Stripe</a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/17/adyen-earnings-h1-2023-stock-down-28percent-after-record-low-sales-growth.html">reported</a> worse-than-expected sales figures and a notable decline in profits.</p>
<h2>Overview of Adyen’s H1 2023 Performance</h2>
<p>The first half of 2023 saw Adyen achieve a revenue of 739.1 million Euros ($804.3 million), marking a 21% increase compared to the same period the previous year. While this is a significant increase, it falls short of analyst’s expectations, which projected revenue estimates of roughly 853.6 million Euros and a growth rate of 40% based on Eikon data.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Adyen’s EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation, and Amortization) for the first six months of 2023 amounted to 320 million Euros, reflecting a worrying decline of 10% from the 356.3 million Euros recorded during the same period in 2022.</p>
<p>The European payments giant attributed its poor performance to various factors, including increased hiring, shifting business priorities among its North American customers, and a slowdown in sales growth compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>Adyen’s management noted that the company embarked on an ambitious hiring spree in order to enhance its operational capabilities and technological advancements. While this step prepares Adyen for future expansion and innovation, the costs of hiring and salary increases has put a strain on its profitability in the immediate term.</p>
<p>Another glaring aspects of Adyen&#8217;s H1 2023 results was the slower sales growth compared to the same period in 2022. In H1 2022, the company reported a robust year-over-year revenue growth of 37%. However, this year, the growth rate significantly decelerated to a 21% increase.</p>
<p>Adyen also noted that its profitability was impacted by inventory write-offs, resulting in a 6.3 million Euro reduction in EBITDA.</p>
<h2>What Distinguishes Adyen from Its Competitors?</h2>
<p>Despite the challenges the company faced in H1 2023, Adyen remains one of the leading fintech firms in Europe. With a substantial market capitalization of 35.4 billion Euros, the company’s significance in the payments space cannot be undermined.</p>
<p>Its client roster, which includes prominent names such as <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/netflix/">Netflix Inc</a> (NASDAQ: NFLX), <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/meta/">Meta Platforms Inc</a> (NASDAQ: META), <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/microsoft-corporation/">Microsoft Corp</a> (NASDAQ: MSFT), and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/spotify/">Spotify Technologies SA</a> (NYSE: SPOT), further solidifies its relevance and reach.</p>
<p>Adyen’s unique revenue model revolves around deriving profits from a small fraction of the total transactions processed for merchants. Operating in the expansive and fiercely competitive payments market, Adyen faces competition from various players vying for a share of the pie.</p>
<p>What distinguishes Adyen is its focus on a unified single payments platform that provides merchants with access to a variety of services. This strategy includes debit cards, buy now, pay later options, and connectivity with popular American mobile wallets such as Google Pay and Apple Pay.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/google-new-capabilities-ai-search-engine/">Google Adds New Capabilities to Its Generative AI-powered Search Engine</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/alphabet-inc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alphabet Inc</a>&#8216;s (NASDAQ: GOOGL) <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/google/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a> has once again solidified its position in the technology world by introducing a series of groundbreaking capabilities to its generative AI-powered search experience (SGE).</p>
<h2>Alphabet Expands AI-Generative Responses</h2>
<p>The recent <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/google-search-generative-ai-learning-features/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announcement</a> from Google unveils a significant upgrade to its AI-generated responses, particularly focused on educational and information-rich topics. The new upgrades currently undergoing initial testing promises to deliver more in-depth information for users exploring scientific theories, economic principles, historical events, or any other subject matter.</p>
<p>As the internet evolves, the sheer number of information available can sometimes contribute to emotions of stress and frustration. Particularly in the case of detailed articles or in-depth reports in which extracting key information quickly can be a challenge. This is where Google’s new SGE feature steps in.</p>
<p>The centerpiece of this feature is the AI-generated summaries. When users visit specific web pages, they will have the opportunity to activate the AI-generated key points feature by tapping a button. This feature provides a brief list of the article&#8217;s key subjects and essential information.</p>
<p>What sets this feature apart is the inclusion of hyperlinks within the generated responses. Each point is connected to the page’s appropriate section, allowing viewers to go deeper into specific areas of interest without having to navigate through the entire text. This improves user control and efficiency, resulting in a smooth exploration experience.</p>
<p>Another standout feature is the ability to drift over specific terms in AI-generated responses to view instant definitions. This is a powerful tool for users encountering unfamiliar words or concepts. No longer will users need to switch between search results and dictionaries; definitions will now be seamlessly integrated, enhancing the learning experience.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the SGE will offer related diagrams and images when users are exploring a topic. This visual component is crucial for improving comprehension, especially for concepts that benefit from visual depiction.</p>
<p>While the Google generative AI undoubtedly enhances convenience and expands discovery, experts caution against an overreliance on AI-generated insights. Beyond the impact on analytical skills, privacy concerns have also emerged in line with the growth of AI in search. However, Google amended its privacy policies on July 1, allowing it to use publicly available data for AI training.</p>
<h2>Google AI Update Spurred by Rising Competition</h2>
<p>The tech world is undergoing an AI-driven transformation, with tools like ChatGPT symbolizing the limitless possibilities AI presents. In this landscape, Google’s push to update its iconic search engine is both a response to the changing technological landscape and a strategic maneuver to outperform dominant players which includes <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft Corp</a> (NASDAQ: MSFT) and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/samsung/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samsung Electronics Co Ltd</a> (KRX: 005930).</p>
<p>As tech giants fight for supremacy by harnessing the power of AI, users can anticipate a future where information access and digital experiences are enriched by the intelligent capabilities of Artificial Intelligence.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-treasury-yield-rises-fed-meeting/">10-Year Treasury Yield Rises in the US Following Minutes of Last Federal Reserve Meeting</a></p>
<p>Treasury yields in the US reacted differently to the Federal Reserve’s last meeting. Investors seem to weigh the implications of the minutes from the meeting, and whether or not there will be any forecast for interest rates and general inflation.</p>
<p>According to minutes of the Fed’s meetings, authorities are still worried about inflation. Officials also believe more rate hikes might be necessary to curb inflation as it is still far from the intended target. In response, the 10-year Treasury was at 4.292% after rising by 3 basis points. On the other hand, the 2-year Treasury fell by 1 basis point to 4.965%.</p>
<p>Many investors and stakeholders have hoped for a while that the last Fed rate increase of 25 basis points would end the continuous round of hikes. However, the Fed’s meeting would suggest otherwise. According to the minutes:</p>
<blockquote><p>“With inflation still well above the Committee’s longer-run goal and the labor market remaining tight, most participants continued to see significant upside risks to inflation, which could require further tightening of monetary policy.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Since the meeting in July, the consumer price index increased by 0.2%, while the producer price index climbed 0.3%. The former met expectations while the latter concluded slightly above.</p>
<p>According to a CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/16/fed-meeting-minutes-signal-coming-rate-moves.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> on the minutes, participants agreed that “inflation pressures could be abating”. However, nearly all participants still believe that further hikes are necessary. The few who disagreed believe that the Fed should hold off on another increase in interest rates to properly watch economic conditions resulting from previous hikes.</p>
<h2>A Few Pointers from the Fed Meeting</h2>
<p>According to the minutes noted from the meeting, participants believe the economy would slow down a bit more. The Fed also has reason to state that there could be an increase in unemployment. However, the Fed fortunately dismissed an earlier projection that the US could enter a mild recession before the year ends.</p>
<p>There is also some Fed worry about real estate. Officials have noted that there are certain risks caused by a possible reduction in the value of commercial real estate (CRE). The document states that these risks could affect several financial institutions with exposure to CRE. Affected institutions may include banks and insurance companies.</p>
<p>Participants also noted possible risks of tightening or loosening monetary policy quicker than necessary. While there is still much to be done regarding inflation hitting the 2% target, levels have improved since the 9% recorded in June last year. The consumer price and consumption expenditures price indexes are performing better, pointing to general improvement.</p>
<p>However, the Fed is not done with interest rate hikes because assuming the worst is over may be risky. If the Fed stops raising rates too quickly, the economy could begin to spiral. Unfortunately, economic growth has not significantly improved even though the Fed has been hiking rates for several months.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/cme-group-btc-eth-reference-rates-apac/">CME Group and CF Benchmarks Floats BTC and ETH Reference Rates in APAC</a></p>
<p>The world’s leading derivatives platform, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/cme-group/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CME Group Inc</a> (NASDAQ: CME) has partnered with CF Benchmarks to launch <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> (BTC) and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a> (ETH) reference rates, cementing crypto&#8217; growing significance in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region.</p>
<p>CME Group stated in a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cme-group-and-cf-benchmarks-to-launch-apac-reference-rates-for-bitcoin-and-ether-on-september-11-301903064.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> that the two new reference rates, CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate APAC and the CME CF Ether-Dollar Reference Rate APAC will go live on September 11. These reference rates will offer a once-a-day snapshot of the US dollar price of Bitcoin and Ethereum, respectively, at 4 p.m. Hong Kong/Singapore time.</p>
<p>Giovanni Vicioso, Global Head of Crypto Products at CME Group, emphasized the importance of these reference rates in the context of the crypto ecosystem. “These new reference rates are designed to meet the ever-evolving needs of global participants in the growing digital asset space,” Vicioso stated.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that CME Group and CF Benchmarks have earlier solidified their partnership by <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/cme-group-cf-benchmarks-metaverse-reference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introducing</a> three new Metaverse reference rates.</p>
<p>The three Metaverse reference rates introduced features Axie Infinity (AXS), Chiliz (CHZ), and Decentraland (MANA). These tokens are key players in the metaverse landscape, each contributing unique aspects to the virtual realm. With their inclusion in reference rates, CME Group and CF Benchmarks acknowledge the increasing influence and potential of the metaverse space.</p>
<h2>CME Group in APAC Market: Core Benefits</h2>
<p>The introduction of Bitcoin and Ethereum reference rates in the APAC region is a significant step forward for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. APAC has been at the forefront of crypto adoption and innovation, with countries like Japan, South Korea, and Singapore leading the way.</p>
<p>Vicioso pointed out that 37% of crypto volume at CME Group year-to-year has been traded during non-US hours, with a noteworthy 11% of trades originating from the APAC region. Therefore, providing accurate reference rates tailored to this region&#8217;s trading hours and market dynamics is essential for attracting institutional investors and further legitimizing the crypto market.</p>
<p>One of the primary advantages of these reference rates is the potential for improved risk management and hedging strategies. Institutional investors, who frequently require precise and trustworthy data, will be able to make more informed judgments concerning their Bitcoin exposure.</p>
<p>Additionally, these rates are anticipated to significantly impact the risk management methods of institutions entering the crypto space, improving their ability to mitigate possible market swings. This partnership couldn&#8217;t come at a better time as the crypto market is expanding rapidly, with popular usage increasing as complemented by growing institutional interest.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the introduction of these reference rates contributes to the ongoing process of legitimizing the crypto market within the regulatory framework. As governments and financial watchdogs increasingly engage with the crypto space, these reference rates can be seen as a responsible step towards meeting regulatory expectations.</p>

<p>For many in the crypto industry, this approval signifies a notable regulatory achievement for both the company and the broader crypto landscape due to the ongoing legal battle between the exchange and the US SEC. </p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coinbase-crypto-futures-approval-big-deal/">Coinbase&#8217;s Crypto Futures Approval Seen as a Big Deal </a></p>
<p>On August 16, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase</a>, one of the world&#8217;s largest crypto exchanges, received regulatory approval to become the first native crypto company to operate as a Futures Commission Merchant (FCM). In June, the SEC accused Coinbase of evading the registration of its product offerings and thereby violating the country&#8217;s federal securities laws.</p>
<p>During the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coinbase-regulatory-approval-crypto-futures-trading/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> yesterday, Coinbase said the FCM registration was approved by the National Futures Association (NFA), a self-regulatory organization under the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/cftc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CFTC</a>) purview. After two years of deliberation, the NFA accepted the application, granting Coinbase permission to provide crypto futures contracts to US residents.</p>
<h2>A Big Deal for Coinbase</h2>
<p>With the registration granted to Coinbase, crypto community members have pointed out the discrepancy between CFTC&#8217;s stance on crypto and the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>&#8216;s reservations about its regulatory status.</p>
<p>Avichal Garg, the founder of investment management firm Electric Capital, said on X, formerly <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/twitter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a>, that getting FCM approved by the commodities regulator takes years of work. Adding that if he were the judge handling the SEC vs Coinbase case, he would question the regulator why it claimed that Coinbase was unwilling to register its product offerings within its jurisdiction.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Getting an FCM via the <a href="https://twitter.com/CFTC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CFTC</a> is a big deal. It takes years of work.</p>
<p>If I were a judge I&#39;d wonder why somehow <a href="https://twitter.com/coinbase?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@coinbase</a> manages to register with the <a href="https://twitter.com/CFTC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CFTC</a> yet the <a href="https://twitter.com/SECGov?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SECGov</a> claims that Coinbase is unwilling to do the hard work to register. <a href="https://t.co/axDHt8ya3F">https://t.co/axDHt8ya3F</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Avichal &#8211; Electric ϟ Capital (@avichal) <a href="https://twitter.com/avichal/status/1691850120785264868?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 16, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Brian Quintenz, former CFTC Commissioner and now policy head at crypto investment firm <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/a16z/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a16z</a>, also commented on the approval, emphasizing the value of an open and constructive dialogue between regulators and the technology sector. This approach, he believes, is conducive to nurturing innovation while safeguarding consumer interests.</p>
<p>&#8220;Coinbase has consistently demonstrated its dedication to regulatory compliance, and here is yet another strong example. Customers and innovation can both win when a regulator is open to having a constructive dialogue around new technology,&#8221; Quintenz said in the <a href="https://twitter.com/BrianQuintenz/status/1691912210430501306?s=20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">tweet</a>.</p>
<h2>Coinbase to Compete with Non-Crypto Companies</h2>
<p>The FCM approval has placed Coinbase in direct competition with non-crypto firms such as Chicago Mercantile Exchange (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/cme-group/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CME</a>) and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/cboe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBOE</a>).</p>
<p>Both firms already offer US customers Bitcoin (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC</a>) and Ethereum (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ETH</a>) futures contracts.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Coinbase said in its announcement yesterday that the derivatives market contributes up to 75% of the total trading volumes. Earlier this year, CoinGecko disclosed that the global directives market stands at $3 trillion.</p>
<p>Market experts believe the approval will significantly increase Coinbase&#8217;s total addressable market.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since the global crypto derivatives market can be three to four times larger than the spot, this approval increases Coinbase&#8217;s total addressable market,&#8221; said Dan Dolev, an analyst at Mizuho Securities, as <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/bitcoin-ethereum-price-crypto-markets-today-fa72efc0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> by Barron&#8217;s.</p>
<p>In terms of its stock performance, Coinbase&#8217;s stock (COIN) remained relatively unaffected by the news, experiencing a 1.56% drop on the same day. However, the bigger picture reveals a positive trajectory, with Coinbase shares having surged by 130% so far this year.</p>

<p>The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs is expected to tip Bitcoin’s supply-demand dynamics in the direction of a significant price surge.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/analyst-tips-bitcoin-surge-past-150k/">Analyst Tips Bitcoin to Surge Past $150K on One Condition</a></p>
<p>The price of Bitcoin (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC</a>) may have slipped below $29,000, but that hasn&#8217;t deterred renowned analyst Tom Lee, from making a wildly bullish price prediction. Lee, who is Fundstrat’s managing partner and head of research, remains adamant that BTC is destined to attain greatness in the coming months.</p>
<p>In a Wednesday <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ir8jYyrBY5s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> with CNBC, Lee insists that he sees BTC surging by over 400% from its current levels. He added that the BTC price could easily surpass the $150,000 mark by 2024 end. But that is only if the pending US spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are approved.</p>
<p>According to Lee, approval of those applications would inadvertently tip Bitcoin’s supply-demand dynamics in the direction of a significant price surge. He said partly:</p>
<blockquote><p>“If the spot Bitcoin (ETF) gets approved, I think the demand will be greater than the daily supply of Bitcoin, so the clearing price [&#8230;] is over $150,000, it could even be like $180,000.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Lee also noted that his prediction specifically has to do with the approval of a United States-approved spot Bitcoin ETF. And that would be understandable, given that the U.S. currently accounts for about 97.7% of the global trading volume for crypto-based ETFs. More so, there are already spot Bitcoin ETFs in Europe.</p>
<h2>It&#8217;s a Win-Win Situation for Bitcoin, Says Tom Lee</h2>
<p>Away from the Bitcoin surge that is dependent on the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, there is another reason for the asset to surge in price. Lee expects another push to happen from Bitcoin’s <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/next-bitcoin-halving-800000th-block/">next halving event</a>, which is expected to take place in April 2024.</p>
<p>According to Lee, this halving will cause supply to drop, therefore, making it necessary for the clearing price to increase. He, however, was quick to add that the price surge from halving will not bring the BTC price to six figures.</p>
<p>Presently, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitcoin-2023-high-blackrock-etf/">BlackRock</a> and several other Wall Street giants have submitted applications for a Bitcoin spot ETF with the SEC. But they might not know their fate until 2024. That is considering that the regulator has a total of 240 days to decide after it starts reviewing an application.</p>

<p>SHIB, BONE, and LEASH tokens have all crashed over the past 24 hours because of a problem that allegedly resulted in lost Shibarium tokens.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/shib-plunge-shibarium-tokens-bridging-problems/">Shib Ecosystem Tokens Plunge Up to 22% Following Reports of a Problem with Bridging Shibarium Tokens</a></p>
<p>Tokens in the Shib universe have plunged to different levels following a problem with bridging on the recently-launched Shibarium. Members of the community holding these tokens were left disappointed as many expected the Shibarium launch to bring good tidings and spike prices.</p>
<p>At the time of this writing, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/shiba-inu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SHIB</a> has fallen over 8% in the last 24 hours, with Shibarium governance token BONE losing more than 17%, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The ecosystem’s Doge Killer (LEASH) token had the worst plunge, at 22% over the last day.</p>
<p>The reactions follow a reported issue after a few screenshots suggested a problem with the Shibarium network launch. One such screenshot reportedly showed a Telegram message sent by lead developer Shytoshi Kusama admitting a problem. Kusama was allegedly saying that the team had lost ETH bridged to the network.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">In case yall were wondering how Shibarium is going <a href="https://t.co/S5vjTxoMDk">pic.twitter.com/S5vjTxoMDk</a></p>
<p>&mdash; ʎppɐꓷ ɯooɹɥS (@shroom_daddy) <a href="https://twitter.com/shroom_daddy/status/1691953231289528683?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 16, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1691960557727846777" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweet</a>, blockchain enthusiast ZachXBT said Shib had more than 954 ETH in the bridge contract, worth more than $1.7 million ETH at the time. In another tweet, ZachXBT said the BONE lost was worth over $762k. The blockchain enthusiast said that although they may not be able to confirm the loss, the “RPC is dead.” ZachXBT said the Shibarium launch was “sloppy” and described the block explorer as “awful.” The RPC runs key blockchain software.</p>
<p>In another <a href="https://twitter.com/shroom_daddy/status/1691953830252917234" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post</a> part of the first screenshot revealing Shytoshi’s admittance, the user added that they couldn’t receive the BONE sent to them because the block scanner was faulty. The account also <a href="https://twitter.com/shroom_daddy/status/1691953687994757292" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> the faulty RPC, stating that the block height is “changing up and down” when it should “only go up as block number only increases.”</p>
<p>At press time, Shibarium’s RPC <a href="https://www.shibrpc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a> is not working. Also, Shibarium has not officially commented on the problem.</p>
<h2>Shibarium Problem Shows Layer 2 Network Has Launch Issues</h2>
<p>According to Shibarium blockchain <a href="https://www.shibariumscan.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data</a>, there have been no activities for 4 hours as of writing time. In addition to these problems, a CoinDesk <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/08/17/shib-plunges-9-on-apparent-shibarium-bridge-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> revealed that users on a Discord community forum have been unable to send messages since reports began to spread.</p>
<p>The problematic Shibarium launch is disappointing considering that members of the Shib community have anticipated the network for a while. Last month, Coinspeaker <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/shibarium-layer-2-blockchain-august/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Shytoshi hinted at an August launch during a Toronto conference. As part of the announcement, Shytoshi also hinted at a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) called DoggyDAO. The DAO will help to fund Shibarium projects under the control and direction of SHIB holders.</p>
<p>In March, Shiba Inu launched a testnet called PuppyNet for anyone to develop and launch decentralized applications (dApps). PuppyNet also functioned as a decentralized governance module and a crypto payments processor for businesses interested in cryptocurrency transactions. By June, the total number of PuppyNet transactions had scaled 20 million across at least 17.7 million addresses. The testnet also had an average block time of 5 seconds.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitgo-100-million-fundraise/">BitGo Successfully Completes $100 Million Fundraise Despite Rough Market Conditions</a></p>
<p>On Wednesday, August 16, crypto custodian <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/bitgo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BitGo</a> announced its plans to raise $100 million at a staggering valuation of $1.75 billion. The company said that it will use these funds for strategic acquisitions as well as to expand its secure and regulated wallet, custody, and other solutions.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">BitGo has secured $100M Series C funding.</p>
<p>Trust is not given, it is earned. We believe in delivering it to our clients and the industry. Being a custodial and infrastructure leader is an undertaking, one we have consistently provided for over a decade.</p>
<p>This funding will allow… <a href="https://t.co/TlPO7722Ha">pic.twitter.com/TlPO7722Ha</a></p>
<p>&mdash; BitGo (@BitGo) <a href="https://twitter.com/BitGo/status/1691802052849201443?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 16, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>From January 2023 onwards, BitGo has experienced a 60% surge in newly registered clients and a 20% growth in Assets Under Custody (AUC). Besides, it has also registered a remarkable 200% rise in fiat custody, and an extraordinary 40-fold expansion in staked assets. Notably, BitGo also handles custody services for <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ftx-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a> creditors&#8217; funds under the leadership of John Ray III. Previously, it was serving as the distributor for <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/mt-gox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mt. Gox</a> creditors as well.</p>
<p>Mike Belshe, the Chief Executive Officer, recognized that the current market is undoubtedly challenging. However, he pointed out that the company&#8217;s emphasis on obtaining licenses and adhering to regulations has distinguished it in the midst of a legal environment characterized by uncertainties regarding the classification of digital assets as securities. &#8220;Regulatory safety is a top concern for everyone at the moment,&#8221; Belshe stated. Speaking further on the matter, Belshe <a href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/bitgo-secures-100m-series-c-funding-at-1-75b-valuation-301901731.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">added</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Not only are we seeing growing demand for regulated custody solutions in the US, but we&#8217;re also seeing the demand on a global scale. We are very pleased to announce our <span class="xn-money">$100M</span> Series C for the purpose of meeting this growing need and to provide institutions, brands, coin foundations, and others with secure and seamless participation in the digital asset ecosystem.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Latest Funding from New Investors</h2>
<p>The company, headquartered in Palo Alto, California, secured the funding exclusively from fresh investors, as <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/bitgo-bucks-crypto-downturn-to-raise-funding-at-1-75-billion-valuation-1.1959756" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">stated</a> by Belshe. While he refrained from revealing the participants in the round, he did mention that they hailed from both the US and Asia, and some were not from the cryptocurrency sector. Among BitGo&#8217;s earlier investors were <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/goldman-sachs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Goldman Sachs Group Inc.</a>, DRW Holdings, and Galaxy Digital Ventures.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s current valuation significantly exceeds its value in 2021, a period during which <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/galaxy-digital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Galaxy Digital Holdings</a> intended to acquire the company for $1.2 billion. However, this deal was eventually abandoned.</p>
<p>BitGo&#8217;s previous fundraising was in 2017, during which it obtained a Series B funding of $42.5 million. This round was spearheaded by Valor Equity Partners and saw involvement from individuals like former PayPal COO David Sacks, former Remarq CEO Bill Lee, and the trading firm DRW. Notably, the list of earlier investors in the crypto custodian encompasses names like Goldman Sachs, Craft Ventures, and Pantera Capital.</p>
<p>Recently, crypto custodian BitGo <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitgo-cancels-acquisition-prime-trust/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided</a> to cancel the acquisition of Prime Trust, just after a few days of its preliminary agreement.</p>

<p>It appears that <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/apple-inc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Inc</a> (NASDAQ: AAPL) may be attempting to diversify the production of its iPhones from its manufacturing base in China. This follows after a recent Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-16/apple-supplier-foxconn-begins-iphone-15-production-in-india">report</a> revealed that Apple supplier Foxconn is set to begin producing the company&#8217;s next-generation iPhone 15 in India. Interestingly, this will be the first time that a new iPhone will be made outside China before an official unveiling.</p>
<p>According to the report, the new phones will be manufactured at a Foxconn plant in Sriperumbudur, Tamil Nadu. And more importantly, they will be ready for delivery only a few weeks after they begin shipping from China-based factories.</p>
<h2>Apple Says There&#8217;s Huge Opportunity in India</h2>
<p>It might be worth noting that Apple has been aiming to make some key changes to its supply chain. That is even as tensions continue to grow between the United States and China. While the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/joe-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden</a>-led administration has been sceptical about allowing the flow of key technologies and investments into China, China <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/intel-drops-tower-acquisition-us-china-tension/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has also placed</a> regulatory pressure on many US entities.</p>
<p>However, Apple CEO <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/tim-cook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tim Cook</a> is claiming that India simply offers a “huge opportunity”. And in line with this potential, the firm has been ramping up iPhone production in the region. According to Bloomberg, Apple assembled over $7 billion worth of devices in India in the last fiscal year.</p>
<p>It is also worth mentioning that, before the iPhone 14 was released, iPhone production in India lagged behind that of China by up to six to nine months. However, that difference in the production timeline is now set to significantly change.</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth though, the scale of ‌iPhone 15‌ production in India will certainly depend on the availability of imported components and the ramp-up of production lines. But Pegatron and Wistron factories will soon be joining Foxconn to assemble the ‌iPhone 15‌.</p>
<p>Apple will unveil the iPhone 15 at its annual event in September. The model is expected to have major camera updates and an improved processor.</p>
