The BRICS nations are working on creating a common currency to reduce their USD reliance.</strong></p>
<h2>Indonesia’s De-Dollarization Efforts</h2>
<p>Bank of Indonesia Governor Perry Warjiyo said Friday that Jakarta is following the lead of the BRICS bloc to shift away from using the U.S. dollar in trade and financial transactions, Sindonews reported Friday. The BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) have been ramping up de-dollarization efforts to use local currencies in international trade and reduce their dependence on the USD. They are also working on establishing a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-nations-working-on-creating-new-currency-to-be-discussed-at-next-leaders-summit/">new currency</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking at a press conference following this month&#8217;s board of governors meeting, the central bank chief confirmed that Indonesia has implemented the local currency trade (LCT) system. He was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Indonesia has initiated diversification of the use of currency in the form of LCT. The direction is the same as the BRICS. In fact, Indonesia is more concrete.</p></blockquote>

<p>He explained that Indonesia&#8217;s LCT system is considerably more concrete than the BRICS de-dollarization approach, given that Indonesia has already implemented the currency diversification method with several nations, including Thailand, Malaysia, China, and Japan. In addition, the Indonesian government plans to sign an agreement with South Korea regarding local currency transactions in early May, he noted.</p>
<p>As the U.S. continues to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/dollar-to-play-lesser-role-due-to-its-weaponization-digital-currencies-economist-jeffrey-sachs-says/">weaponize</a> the dollar, countries are seeking alternatives, from creating new common currencies to using local currencies. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-treasury-secretary-janet-yellen-acknowledges-sanctions-weaponization-could-hurt-dollar-hegemony/">admitted</a> that economic sanctions used against countries by the U.S. put the dollar&#8217;s dominance at risk.</p>

<h2>Digital Currency &#8216;Bound by No Restrictions&#8217; in Russia&#8217;s New Payment System</h2>
<p>Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said Monday that a new payment system will be launched where the use of digital currencies in international payments will be completely unrestricted, Russian news outlet Tass reported.</p>
<p>“We are launching an alternative system of payments based on modern technologies (digital financial assets, digital currencies),” the finance minister was quoted as saying. He elaborated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Digital currencies could be used in cross-border payments. This is just at the earliest phase of discussions, but the future lies with the use of the digital ruble, the digital yuan, and other similar currencies.</p></blockquote>
<p>“This is a system of payments that is bound by no restrictions. Two parties come to an agreement, make settlement payments, and no other country could step in and freeze such payments,&#8221; Siluanov emphasized.</p>
<p>Due to the economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other Western nations following the start of the Russia-Ukraine war, Russia has intensified its efforts to reduce its reliance on the U.S. dollar. The U.S. and Western allies have seized more than $300 billion in Russian central bank foreign currency assets frozen by sanctions.</p>
<p>The Bank of Russia has been exploring the creation of a digital currency, the digital ruble, as a way to shift away from the U.S. dollar. A report published by the U.S. Congressional Research Service in July 2021 details that the Russian government accelerated its de-dollarization efforts in 2014, noting that the launch of a digital ruble &#8220;would further reduce Russia’s reliance on Western (and dollar-centered) payments infrastructure.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Russia’s De-Dollarization Push</h2>
<p>Finance Minister Siluanov also revealed Monday at an education marathon event that the Russian ruble and the Chinese yuan are already replacing the U.S. dollar in mutual settlements between Russia and China, Tass also reported. When asked if the ruble or yuan could replace the USD, the top official replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are already looking at this. For better or worse, I think, this is the current situation. This is our currency … It is replacing [dollar] already. If we look at the structure of trade between Russia and China, now more than 70% — it is already in our national currencies.</p></blockquote>

The global bank&#x2019;s analyst has identified several factors contributing to the surge in the price of the cryptocurrency, including the recent turmoil in the banking sector.</strong></p>
<h2>Standard Chartered Bank on Bitcoin Hitting $100K</h2>
<p>Global bank Standard Chartered <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/bitcoin-could-hit-100000-by-end-2024-standard-chartered-says-2023-04-24/">said</a> Monday that &#x201C;crypto winter&#x201D; is over and the price of bitcoin could reach $100,000 by the end of 2024.</p>
<p>Standard Chartered&#x2019;s head of digital assets research, Geoff Kendrick, explained in a note that bitcoin stands to benefit from various factors. They include the recent turmoil in the banking sector, a stabilization of risky assets as the U.S. Federal Reserve ends its cycle of interest rate hikes, and the enhanced profitability of cryptocurrency mining. The analyst wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>While sources of uncertainty remain, we think the pathway to the USD 100,000 level is becoming clearer.</p></blockquote>

<p>A growing number of individuals and analysts have recently expressed optimism regarding the outlook for bitcoin and the overall cryptocurrency market. At the time of writing, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> is trading at $27,464, down from above $30K a week prior. However, the cryptocurrency is up 65% year-to-date.</p>
<p>In March, the CEO of investment management firm Vaneck said that &#x201C;We are at the very beginnings of what could be a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/vaneck-ceo-predicts-bull-cycle-for-bitcoin-and-gold-expects-fed-tightening-to-end-soon/">several-year cycle</a>&#x201D; in gold and bitcoin while Bloomberg Intelligence&#x2019;s commodity strategist stated that a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-supercycle-may-be-happening-says-commodity-strategist-mike-mcglone/">supercycle</a> may be happening in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. In February, Pantera Capital said that we&#x2019;re already in the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/pantera-capital-on-bitcoin-were-in-next-bull-market-cycle/">next bull market cycle</a> for bitcoin. Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki expects <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-expects-bitcoins-price-to-keep-rising-says-im-betting-on-it/">keep rising</a>, predicting that the price of the largest crypto will reach <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-predicts-bitcoin-hitting-500k-by-2025-and-gold-soaring-to-5k/">$500K by 2025</a>.</p>

The supported trading pair is BGB/<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a>, and the trading service will be opened at Bitfinex.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bitget.com/en/academy/article-details/Bitget-Token-BGB">BGB</a> is a utility token that plays a vital role in Bitget&#x2019;s ecosystem, with a circulating supply of 1,400,000,000 BGB coins and a total supply of 2,000,000,000. It provides users with access to exclusive privileges and various rights on the Bitget exchange, including fee discounts, opportunities to join Launchpad and Launchpool to access high-quality tokens, vote for project listings, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Gracy Chen, Managing Director of Bitget says</strong>, &#x201C;<em>We are thrilled to see BGB listed on </em>Bitfinex&#x2019;s platform<em>, reflecting the recognition and achievement of Bitget in the</em> <em>crypto space. With the ongoing initiatives to increase the usage and value of BGB, we expect that this move will further expand the reach of our platform. In the meantime, as our ecosystem continues to grow in the CeFi and DeFi world, empowering BGB with more visibility and utility will also be one of our focuses ahead.</em>&#x201D;</p>
<p>The decision to list BGB on Bitfinex comes in response to the increasing demand for the token in the market. Entering 2023, BGB has experienced significant price growth over the last few months and reached an all-time high of 0.51 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a> in February. The surge in price can be attributed to several factors, including the increased adoption of the Bitget exchange and its recent efforts in building the spot trading market. And the recently <a href="https://www.bitget.com/en/support/articles/12560603780783">updated BGB whitepaper</a> revealed that more new features of the native token are being developed, including the BGB lottery, trial fund for futures trading, and exclusive earning services. A BGB buyback and burn mechanism are also being considered to reduce the token&#x2019;s circulating supply and eventually boost its value.</p>

Paul stated that the debasement of the currency, the manipulation of prices, and sanctions against other nations have made other countries afraid of holding dollars.</strong></p>
<h2>Ron Paul Believes De-Dollarization Is Happening at a Rapid Pace</h2>
<p>Ron Paul, former U.S. presidential candidate and former U.S. congressional representative, has talked about how he believes de-dollarization is starting to accelerate recently, even if he does not know <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ron-paul-on-the-fall-of-the-us-dollar-as-reserve-currency-its-always-longer-than-some-predictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when</a> the U.S. dollar will lose its reserve currency status.</p>
<p>In the latest episode of &#8220;The Ron Paul Liberty Report,&#8221; his online videocast, Ron Paul clarified a global reduction in the percentage of reserves held in U.S. dollars is caused by several circumstances, <a href="https://twitter.com/RonPaul/status/1649792024659238912?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including</a> &#8220;America&#8217;s endless wars, sanctions, wokism, nihilism, and unconstitutional abuses.&#8221;</p>
<p>About the consequences of this, Paul <a href="https://rumble.com/v2jmj6w-de-dollarization-is-the-world-fed-up-with-the-u.s.-empire.html?mref=jcwo5&amp;mc=2sdbb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is already starting. More and more we have a series of countries that are transacting their international accounts in their own currencies and ignoring it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, Paul declared that the U.S. government has a hand in &#8220;rigging&#8221; the price of gold in order to make the dollar look stronger, having &#8220;no respect&#8221; for gold.</p>

<h2>Dollar Replacement and BRICS</h2>
<p>About the possible replacement of the U.S. dollar on international markets, Paul stated that while he was not sure, Russia and China might have some kind of influence in the response to the vacuum that the dollar could leave behind. He also included BRICS, the bloc integrated by Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, as part of this answer.</p>
<p>Paul stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would keep an eye on BRICS and if they continue or accelerate their purchase of gold. Eventually, the best standard of money is that it is easily convertible into something that you can measure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The BRICS bloc has been studying the issuance of a currency since at least last year, when Russian President Vladimir Putin made the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/targeting-the-us-dollars-hegemony-russia-china-and-brics-nations-plan-to-craft-a-new-international-reserve-currency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> at the 14th BRICS summit held in China.</p>
<p>More recently, Russian State Duma Deputy Chairman Alexander Babakov <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-nations-working-on-creating-new-currency-to-be-discussed-at-next-leaders-summit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> that such a currency might be potentially backed by gold or other commodities, including rare-earth elements or even land. However, the definition of the structure of the currency could be announced at the next BRICS summit to be held in South Africa in August.</p>

This new addition to Binance&#x2019;s staking solutions is built on the Ethereum network, joining the ranks of other competing liquid staking products such as Lido, Coinbase, Rocket Pool, and Frax.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>WBETH Emerges as Binance&#x2019;s New Solution to Ethereum-Based Staking</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Liquid staking products based on Ethereum have been gaining popularity over the past two years. According to defillama.com <a href="https://defillama.com/lsd">metrics</a>, as of this writing, there are over 8.2 million ether worth $15.49 billion locked into liquid staking derivatives. A staggering 74.22% of these ether assets are held by Lido Finance, the current leader in this space.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Coinbase&#x2019;s wrapped ether product comes in second with $2.19 billion locked, followed by Rocket Pool with $983.26 million, Frax with $297.09 million, and Stakewise with $163.98 million. Binance has <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-introduces-wrapped-beacon-eth-wbeth-on-eth-staking-a1197f34d832445db41654ad01f56b4d">revealed</a> that it has created two contracts for its new WBETH token, one for the <a href="https://bscscan.com/address/0xa2E3356610840701BDf5611a53974510Ae27E2e1">Binance Smart Chain</a> and one for <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xa2E3356610840701BDf5611a53974510Ae27E2e1">Ethereum</a>. The token will be available for trading on Binance from Thursday, with BUSD, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>, and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a> trading pairs.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Starting on April 27, 2023, users will be able to create WBETH by depositing 1 ether, and vice versa. &#x201C;Each WBETH token will accrue <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> Staking rewards daily, in accordance with the daily APR on <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> Staking,&#x201D; states Binance. Additionally, to &#x201C;support the daily updates of the BETH/WBETH conversion rate, the &#x2018;Wrap&#x2019; and &#x2018;Unwrap&#x2019; functions will be temporarily paused each day&#x201D; at a designated time.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />

Despite the recent enforcement action by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against Kwon, the South Korean court has determined that LUNC is not a security, further clarifying its position in the matter.</strong></p>
<h2>Seoul Southern District Court Says LUNC Is Not a Security</h2>
<p>In its <a href="https://m.ilyo.co.kr/?ac=article_view&amp;entry_id=450928">recent ruling</a>, the Seoul Southern District Court noted that it finds it challenging to perceive LUNC as a financial investment product regulated by the Capital Markets Act. The court further explained that the South Korean officials from the Seoul prosecutors office cannot seize Terra co-founder <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/terraform-labs-co-founder-daniel-shins-firm-chai-reportedly-raided-by-seoul-prosecutors/">Daniel Shin&#8217;s</a> cryptocurrency assets. These findings may come as a relief to Kwon, who is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/terraform-labs-co-founder-do-kwon-arrested-in-montenegro-says-interior-minister/">currently in custody</a> in Montenegro after being <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/terraform-labs-and-ceo-do-kwon-charged-by-sec-with-multibillion-dollar-crypto-fraud/">charged</a> by the SEC with multibillion-dollar fraud in mid-February.</p>
<p>The SEC&#8217;s lawsuit claimed that LUNC and other Terra crypto assets were offered and sold as investment contracts, hence qualifying as a security. While Shin is situated in South Korea, Kwon&#8217;s lawyers have <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/do-kwon-challenges-secs-jurisdiction-in-multibillion-dollar-crypto-securities-fraud-case/">contested</a> the SEC&#8217;s classification of Terra assets as securities, and the law firm is also challenging the jurisdiction of the U.S. regulator. Kwon&#8217;s case may be bolstered by the recent decision in South Korea, which recognizes LUNC as a non-security.</p>
<p>Interestingly, a mid-April <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/do-kwons-terraform-sent-7-million-to-law-firm-before-collapse-report-unveils/">report</a> suggests that Kwon had allegedly paid $7 million to a top law firm in South Korea before Terra&#8217;s ecosystem collapsed. This news may raise further questions about the legitimacy of Kwon&#8217;s actions and the Terraform Labs company as a whole. The ongoing legal proceedings will undoubtedly bring more clarity and closure to the matter, but for now, the recent court decision in South Korea marks a positive step forward for Kwon and Terra. Despite the news, LUNC is down 2.2% today and down 9% against the U.S. dollar over the past month.</p>
<p><em><strong>What are your thoughts on the South Korean court&#8217;s ruling that Terra&#8217;s LUNC is not a security, and how do you think it will impact the ongoing legal battle between Do Kwon, Terraform Labs, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission? Share your thoughts about this subject in the comments section below.</strong></em></p>

The global crypto market cap is down 0.15% at the time of writing, as volatility remains high. Chainlink also moved higher in today&#x2019;s session.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>)</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>) bounced from a key point of support to start the week, as the token rallied, despite Monday&#x2019;s crypto red wave.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Following a low of $84.92 on Sunday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>/USD raced to an intraday peak of $88.89 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As a result of this move, litecoin moved further away from its price floor at $86.00, and is now trading at its highest point since last Friday.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
From the chart, it appears that the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has now risen to a point of resistance at 45.00, leading to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a> giving up earlier gains.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 44.33, with litecoin trading at $88.11.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Should price strength move beyond the 45.00 mark, there is a good chance that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a> will be back above $90.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>Chainlink (LINK)</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Chainlink (LINK) was also in the green in today&#x2019;s session, and the token rose by as much as 2%.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
LINK/USD climbed to a peak of $7.25 to start the week, following a low of $6.92 on Sunday.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Today&#x2019;s rebound sees LINK move away from the three-and-a-half-week low registered over the weekend.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Looking at the chart, this coincides with the RSI bouncing from a floor of its own at the 44.00 mark.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Currently price strength is tracking at 45.09, with a resistance point at 47.00 a potential target for bulls.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Should it hit this mark, then it is likely that LINK will move above $7.30.&#13;<br />

This is due to the fact that dormant wallets from that era are becoming a rarity to behold. The latest expenditure of a 2010 block took place on April 22, 2023, at 11:14 p.m. (UTC), when a miner spent 50 bitcoin that was valued at approximately $1.3 million. A historic moment occurred today, as a transfer of 400 bitcoin from 2011 took place, marking the first time in over a decade that these digital assets had been moved.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Rare Bitcoin Activity: 985 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> from 2010 and 2011 Moved in 2023</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Block rewards of antiquity from 2010 and 2011 have become increasingly scarce. Only three 2010 blocks were spent this year, along with several ancient bitcoins from 2011. On Jan. 26, 2023, a block reward of 50 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> was <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/18FetRQjkvAU554VmCSqCWQeyrtzzU9TGV">spent</a> at block height 773,723. Around ten bitcoins from 2011 were <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/1LP7Bbw1zkBJsxz8wjAHFVDDiCJu9uygzr">spent</a> on Jan. 8, 2023, at block height 770,924.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Just before the 50 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> spend, at block height 773,718, 40 bitcoins from 2011 were <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/1L8tbeW1bnyJVWzFixbKkxV9MQ76RB3R3W">transferred</a> on the same day. Additionally, at block height 773,745 on that day, another 100 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> from 2011 was <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/1ArjWxM1RjYXsKAGpwAgmirgguDoKugQs2">sent</a>. On Jan. 29, 2023, at block height 774,203, approximately 5.853 bitcoins were <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/1AxX5RCFz4eH4DSkZQtMAaDpsivVW1qMTQ">transferred</a>. In total, around 205.85 bitcoins from 2011 were transferred in January 2023.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
On Feb. 2, a block reward from 2010 <a href="https://oxt.me/address/13UXyHZsVRLeu28VEmdRF3pduSAxzcHL9k">sent 50 bitcoins</a> at block height 774,546 after sitting idle for 13 years. Although the month saw only one 2010 transaction, there was also a single 2011 spend in which 218.82 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> was <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/1BVwvkpEt6LtLkfTWf77bDPByERuY5VQfT">transferred</a>. The large transfer took place on Feb. 10, 2023, at block height 775,933.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Between these two 2010 and 2011 spends, a total of 268.82 ancient bitcoins were moved in February for the first time in over a decade. Although February had two spends from the early years, March also recorded two transfers from those years. For instance, 11 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> was <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/1MySon3VPXGeVdU453TMUVWnWQEkD3CtkR">sent</a> on March 18 at block height 781,355. Two days later, at block height 781,697, a rare 2010 block reward of 50 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> was <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/1QC2eAKL4dmvvaNUwCcxobKhewRubj4rWt">sent</a>.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In March 2023, only 61 ancient bitcoins from 2010 and 2011 were transferred. April has also seen some activity in terms of older bitcoin spends from the 2010 and 2011 eras. On Monday, April 24, 2023, 400 bitcoins from 2011 were <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/1Mjundq2zvjzRKy6VbTfPKsAZhVZe4dLtY">transferred</a>, worth $11 million using today&#x2019;s <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> exchange rates.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The action occurred at block height 786,801, and the address still has 600 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> remaining. The 400 bitcoins worth $11 million today were only worth $1,380 when acquired by the user on May 5, 2011. Interestingly, a <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/16M6tUcPmpVkZ92Lr9mGRuiEiubJgRav9N">block reward</a> from 2010 was spent on April 22, 2023. However, because the owner sent 0.00001094 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> of dust in 2021, blockchain parsers did not catch the 2023 spend because it wasn&#x2019;t a virgin address after the 2021 transfer.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Although April is not yet over, 450 bitcoins from the 2010 and 2011 eras have been spent during the last 24 days of the month. Furthermore, approximately 985.67 bitcoins that originated from those two years have been moved so far in 2023. Using today&#x2019;s <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD exchange rates, the stash is worth $27,120,020 in USD value.&#13;<br />
