This development marks a notable shift in the stance of traditional banks towards bitcoin, as HSBC has previously been cautious in embracing it.</p><p>Reporting by CoinDesk <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/06/26/hong-kongs-hsbc-allows-customers-to-trade-bitcoin-ether-etfs-but-thats-not-really-news/">highlighted</a> that HSBC's decision to enable bitcoin ETF trading for its customers comes after several prior developments that saw other banks also allow such activity. Notably, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/samsung-launches-bitcoin-etf-hong-kong">Samsung Asset Management launched</a> the Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active ETF on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Prior to that, the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/hong-kong-bitcoin-etf-receives-53-million">CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF</a> launched on the same platform, receiving approximately $53 million in initial investments. </p><p>The decision by HSBC to allow its customers to trade bitcoin ETFs comes amidst a surge of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/valkyrie-investments-joins-flurry-of-firms-filing-for-spot-bitcoin-etfs">institutional interest</a> in bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., potentially igniting a race between countries to attract capital with these products. </p><p>The developments are also indicative of the evolving attitudes towards bitcoin among financial institutions. As traditional banks begin to embrace bitcoin, it signals a potential shift towards wider adoption and integration of bitcoin into the mainstream financial system. The merits of this are <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/print/apocalypse-fednow">debatable</a>, but on the surface, that appears to be what these moves signify.<br><br>ETFs are popular investment vehicles, and the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs would open up new opportunities for institutional investors to participate in the bitcoin market within a regulated framework. While this comes at the cost of many of the inherent properties that make bitcoin valuable, institutions prefer the rails of regulation and are more likely to be trusting of firms like BlackRock. There are, of course, exceptions to this such as <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/microstrategy-purchases-6455-btc-pays-off-205m-loan">MicroStrategy</a>, a company that holds its own bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzOTk5NDg5MTkzODEzNTA5/bitcoin-domino.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[MicroBT Brings ASIC Manufacturing To America In Partnership With Riot Platforms]]></title><description><![CDATA[One of the largest Bitcoin miner producers has partnered with America’s largest mining firm to bring ASIC production onshore.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/microbt-brings-asic-manufacturing-to-america-in-partnership-with-riot-platforms</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/microbt-brings-asic-manufacturing-to-america-in-partnership-with-riot-platforms</guid><category><![CDATA[Mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Asics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Public Miners]]></category><category><![CDATA[whatsminer]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[MicroBT]]></category><category><![CDATA[Riot Platforms]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jun 2023 13:47:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgzMjM5NTgzMDQxOTg3NjIy/img_4431.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><a href="http://bitcoin/">Riot Platforms</a>, the largest public U.S. Bitcoin mining company in terms of developed capacity, has made a groundbreaking announcement regarding a partnership with Bitcoin ASIC manufacturer, <a href="https://www.microbt.com/#/">MicroBT</a>. The two major bitcoin companies will bring the production of MicroBT’s ASICs to America. The collaboration aims to secure miners for Riot's Corsicana facility, significantly boosting the company's mining capabilities. According to a press release shared with Bitcoin Magazine, this development comes as Riot's Corsicana facility is set to increase the company's developed capacity to 1.6 GW.</p><p>“This agreement directly repudiates every major criticism of our industry,” the press release stated. “For those concerned about our energy consumption, these machines will be more efficient than ever … For those who say Bitcoin mining data centers do not actually create jobs, we are helping to create hundreds of jobs, between the MicroBT manufacturing facility in Pennsylvania, and our state of the art data center coming to Corsicana, Texas.” </p><p>One of the key highlights of this partnership is the expected increase in Riot's self-mining hash rate capacity. The press release states that by mid-2024, upon the full installation of the machines from this order, Riot's self-mining hash rate capacity is projected to surge by approximately 61% to over 20 EH/s. This significant boost in capacity further establishes Riot's position as a leading player in the Bitcoin mining industry.</p><p>Moreover, this partnership between Riot and MicroBT also marks a pivotal moment for the industry. Bitcoin miner manufacturing has traditionally been concentrated in Asia, but this new partnership with Riot strengthens the domestic supply chain in the United States. It expands the options available to Bitcoin miners, offering them a robust selection of machines.</p><p>Importantly, the collaboration between Riot and MicroBT will not only have a positive impact on the industry but also on local job creation. The machines will be manufactured by MicroBT at a new facility in the United States, generating employment opportunities in the local area.</p><p>Riot's partnership with MicroBT signifies a major milestone within the Bitcoin mining industry. With the increased hash rate, domestic manufacturing and job creation, this collaboration is set to shape the future of Bitcoin mining in the United States and contribute to the growth of the industry as a whole.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgzMjM5NTgzMDQxOTg3NjIy/img_4431.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[BTC Prague And The Value Of In-Person Bitcoin]]></title><description><![CDATA[The BTC Prague event showcased the importance of live Bitcoin education, connections and celebration.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/btc-prague-demonstrated-the-value-of-bitcoin-events</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/btc-prague-demonstrated-the-value-of-bitcoin-events</guid><category><![CDATA[Conference]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Europe]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Prague]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Marek Feder]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jun 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzNTEyMTIxODA2MzY2MTky/bitcoin-adoption-map.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Marek Feder, the editor in chief of Investro and a Bitcoin journalist who recently attended the BTC Prague event.</em></p><p>Let’s start with a disclaimer: I am not associated with the organizers of BTC Prague in any way, so in this article, I only provide my personal experience and views as an attendee. And one more disclaimer: I have not been to many Bitcoin conferences, so my takes and impressions from BTC Prague might be old news for some of you. However, I do believe that it was the first “huge” Bitcoin conference not only for myself, but also for countless others from Central Europe, so it might be nice to sum up the whole experience. </p><h2>A Conference Literally For Anyone</h2><p>The fact that the cheapest ticket to BTC Prague was only <a href="https://blockdyor.com/btc-prague/">9 euro</a> (about $11) means that this conference was literally for anyone. There were obviously some limitations to this access, but the cheapest ticket got people to the exposition area as well as to two stages, which was definitely well worth it. This was probably one of the nicest touches by the organizers, as they made this conference available for masses, even outside of Bitcoin. </p><p>This was further enhanced by the fact that the programming on the “Czech Stage” was entirely about Bitcoin basics. It contained talks about what money is; introductions to Bitcoin, privacy and self-custody; explanation of the differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum; and much more. </p><p>For two days, newcomers to the Bitcoin world could have listened to some of Bitcoin’s finest from the Czech Republic and Slovakia and receive educations equal to those gained from studying for hundreds of hours. I believe this highlights the importance of in-person conferences and affordable events that can help with orange pilling the mainstream. </p><h2>Industry Day Rulez!</h2><p>While the main conference presented on the Czech Stage and programming for Bitcoin beginners took part on <a href="https://www.btcprague.com/program/">June 9 and June 10</a>, the industry day content focused on businesses started on June 8, and I believe this was the best day for making connections and new friends. </p><p>First of all, during the day, there were “only” two stages with talks and keynotes (the Czech Stage was not open at that time), meaning that there was less of an official program. This allowed people to spend more time in the well-thought-out and inspiring exposition area, where they could find dozens and dozens of companies and Bitcoin organizations.<a href="https://www.btctimes.com/news/three-booths-at-btc-prague-2023-that-benefit-all-bitcoiners"> With more than 70 stalls and booths</a>, attendees had a chance to talk to mining businesses, wallet providers, Bitcoin book shops, education organizations and countless other Bitcoin-related businesses. </p><p>And since the expo area was not as crowded on industry day, it provided the best chance for attendees to have in-depth conversations with all of the attending businesses. Having spent much of the first day in the expo area, I was really surprised by not only the openness and friendliness of all the participants, but also their willingness to have very thorough and informative discussions with anyone who was willing to listen and ask questions. </p><h2>A Top-Notch Program </h2><p>Michael Saylor, Adam Back, Eric Weiss, Giacomo Zucco, Stephan Livera, Marek “Slush” Palatinus, Ben Perrin, Peter McCormack, Rockstar Dev and many, many others <a href="https://www.btcprague.com/speakers/">spoke at the event</a>. The BTC Prague conference had an incredible lineup with Bitcoin experts, developers, entrepreneurs, influencers and business people flying from literally all across the globe. The keynotes, discussion panels and talks were incredible. </p><p>As of this writing, the recordings for only two of the on-stage presentations have been released on the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BTCPrague"> official YouTube channel</a>. However, both of them are well worth a watch. Saylor’s “The Future Of Bitcoin” and Zucco’s “Ordinals Are Retarded,” for instance, filled the main hall to the last seat as people listened to these inspiring and educational keynotes. I highly recommend watching both of them.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Mhu6dxj7qk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>The talks also included some<a href="https://www.investro.com/most-important-bitcoin-related-announcements-from-btcprague"> interesting announcements</a> from the speakers, but detailing what was announced would probably take up a whole article alone. Nevertheless, the announcements by<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/satoshilabs-introduces-vexl-foundation-with-bitcoin-app-and-financial-tyranny-index"> Vexl Foundation</a>, AmityAge, Fedimint and Aleks Svetski are worth looking into in particular</p><h2>A Plethora Of Fascinating Side Events </h2><p>Before the conference, some of my Bitcoin friends had mentioned that the most important parts would be the expo area and side events. As weird as that may sound, I now understand why they felt that way. While I was not able to personally attend all of the side events, I heard only the best feedback and opinions about the likes of “<a href="https://www.btcprague.com/dev-hack-day/">dev/hack/day</a>,” a Nostr meetup and other events. </p><p>If the attendees really wanted to enjoy the talks and keynotes, and thus did not spend a lot of time in the expo area, the side events were an ideal chance for talking to people in a less formal way. From my observation, the vast majority of the employees from the conference stalls and booths were out and meeting with people even during the side events, giving the attendees a chance to talk with them in a more relaxed manner. Often, this was accompanied by a pint of renowned Czech beer at a restaurant serving homemade specialties of the local cuisine, making it even more pleasant. </p><h2>Room For Improvement</h2><p>Well, there is not much that I would have changed or that I believe is necessary to improve to make this event even more spectacular. However, one minor improvement might have led to even more satisfaction from attendees, yet, it was not related to the program, speakers or booths:</p><p>The food trucks were a source of friction that might be improved in the next event. At times, extremely long queues meant that people were waiting for their food for way longer than they should have, which could cost them precious time in such a tightly-packed conference schedule. </p><p>Additionally, while Lightning Network payments were available in all of the possible food court areas, with the exception of common areas of the hall, where I assume it was just not possible to accept Lightning payments, the food trucks often battled with this payment option.</p><p>I witnessed several problems with accepting Lightning as a payment method for food or drinks myself. Whether that was due to internet connection, problems with the operations of point-of-sale devices or mobile wallets, or just the pure frown on the face of a food vendor who was obviously tired of yet another “Bitcoin freak” paying with this internet money, the whole payment-in-Lightning experience could have been improved. </p><p>Obviously, this was not a big deal and I can hardly imagine a conference of this size being completely without flaws. And it should be noted that Lightning payments were available, if the vendors and buyers showed a bit of patience. </p><p>All in all, this was not critical to the overall feeling and outcome of the conference, but should the organizers strive for improvement for the next year, I would probably start here. </p><h2>Will You Attend BTC Prague 2024? </h2><p>And, speaking of next year, the organizers have officially announced that the<a href="https://www.btcprague.com/"> second BTC Prague conference</a> will take place, unsurprisingly, in Prague, between June 13 and June 15, 2024. If the level of the next year’s conference should be anywhere near the event I attended, it will be a blast for sure.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Marek Feder.

However, time is scarce, so we can't talk to everyone. But what if you could multiply your efforts and help someone close to you benefit from Bitcoin in the process? If you're looking for an orange-pilling opportunity with the most asymmetric upside, consider talking about Bitcoin and the Lightning Network with your barber or stylist.</p><h2>The Perfect Environment</h2><p>Once you sit down in the chair and that cape goes around your neck, you know you’re both going to be there for a while. As a Bitcoiner, that can only mean one thing: You have been given the gift of time to talk about Bitcoin.</p><p>Few routine interactions last as long as a haircut or salon appointment. Even fewer grant you the freedom to discuss any topic of your choosing. Additionally, the setting naturally limits distractions, such as phone usage. That makes the time you spend in your barber's or stylist's chair the perfect environment to talk about Bitcoin.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>A Trusted Relationship</h2><p>How long have you been with your current barber or stylist? Relationships between clients and stylists often span years, if not decades. There is a bond between you that is rooted in trust, and this connection fosters a level of intimacy rarely found outside of familial settings. People often share secrets with their stylists and barbers that they wouldn't disclose to anyone else. Clairol's iconic ad campaign captured this sentiment with the tagline, "Only her hairdresser knows for sure."</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>A Force Multiplier</h2><p>Your barber or stylist likely has the broadest network of anyone you know. People from every walk of life, including business owners, accountants, teachers, firefighters and politicians, sit in their chairs, sometimes for hours. It is likely that no one else in your sphere of influence has the amount of time and trust to help others learn about and understand Bitcoin. The same unique factors that create the ideal environment for you to talk with them about Bitcoin are the exact reasons why they have the potential to orange pill others.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>The Right Approach</h2><p>To discuss Bitcoin with your barber or stylist, consider their interests and what might best resonate with them. Are they concerned about rising costs? Do they have family members living in authoritarian countries? Choose your approach based on your understanding of their needs.</p><p>If you're unsure about your approach or just recently began going to a new barber or stylist, don’t talk to them about Bitcoin. Talk to them about Lightning instead.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Lightning As A Cheat Code</h2><p>As the saying goes, "The way to a man's heart is through his stomach." Similarly, the way to a business owner's heart is through their wallet. People naturally follow their incentives, and your barber or stylist will be intrigued if you discuss how Lightning payments can increase their profits. Share some benefits of accepting Lightning payments, such as:</p><ul><li>Fast: Funds are available immediately</li><li>Cheap: <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-lightning-network-is-1-000x-cheaper-than-visa-and-mastercard-data">Significant savings</a> compared to typical credit card fees</li><li>Final: No chargebacks</li><li>Growth: Reaching a new client base and expanding their business</li></ul><p>Once they are curious, demonstrate the ease of using Lightning by having them download your favorite Lightning wallet and sending them some sats. Then, have them send you half the sats back. Show them the minimal fees and remind them that those funds are theirs (final) the moment they receive them. The combination of hearing you describe the benefits, seeing how easy it is to use and doing a transaction themselves is a powerful, persuasive mechanism to pique their interest and demystify the process.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Is your color still processing, or are you getting a shave? If you are there for a longer appointment, they might have time to express concern about bitcoin's volatility. If they do, explain that, just as the price of Visa’s stock doesn’t affect the value of their credit card transactions, the price of bitcoin doesn’t have to affect the value of their Lightning payments. You can also introduce them to services like <a href="https://www.ibexpay.io/">Ibex</a> or <a href="https://strike.me/">Strike</a> which can protect them against price fluctuations. </p><p>If they wonder how accepting Lightning can help them find new customers, show them how tools like <a href="https://btcmap.org/">BTC Map</a> and <a href="https://satmap.app/">Satmap</a> offer free marketing for their shop or salon, or how tools like <a href="https://www.oshi.tech/">Oshi</a> and <a href="https://joltzrewards.com/">Joltz Rewards</a> make it easy for them to engage with and retain their new Bitcoin clients. </p><p>Most importantly, remember that they do not need to commit to the Bitcoin revolution on day one. Instead, get them interested and experiencing the benefits of Lightning first. They'll want to know more soon enough.</p><p>Finally, you do not have to cover all of these elements in one visit. Conversion can take time. Luckily, you’ll be back in a few weeks for your next visit and can pick up where you left off.</p><h2>The Finishing Touch</h2><p><br>Introducing your barber or stylist to Lightning payments can enhance their business and help you promote Bitcoin to a broader audience by leaning on the unique relationship you share with them.

Yet, every year, the debate continues about whether bitcoin should evolve to become something more. Can “digital” gold also be the world’s currency? Could Bitcoin’s blockchain be used to register assets of value? Should it?</p><p>This conversation has peaked with the launch of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoins-high-fees-create-controversy-and-challenges">Bitcoin Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens</a>, driving even more demand to the Bitcoin blockchain. And understandably so — Bitcoin’s peerless security and stability made it known as the blockchain of value. Now that it is possible to store a growing range of assets there, people want to. This is welcome news for the store-of-value proponents, as demand for bitcoin should drive up the price. </p><p>But more transactions also mean more competition, and if you want your transaction to go through, that means more fees and longer confirmation times. This is not ideal for the supporters that prefer bitcoin as a currency and the growing competition for block space is <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/ordinal-concerns-bitcoin-decentralization-and-block-space">already affecting the ability to register assets</a>. </p><h2>The Economist’s Evolutionary Theory</h2><p>This dilemma isn’t new for Bitcoin. Its intentional restriction of the block size and transaction capacity has pioneered great tech, like the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/how-does-the-lightning-network-work">Lightning Network</a>, and instigated debates over adopting <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/colored-coins">colored coins</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-miners-and-core-developers-release-segwit-hard-fork-agreement-1457018394">SegWit</a> and other Core changes.</p><p>And Bitcoin is not an exception. When other blockchains came into the market, their ability to handle ERC-20 tokens, NFTs and other operations restricted their popularity. Ethereum was faced with similar limitations, but somewhat resolved them with technical upgrades. However, this led DApps to find shelter in alternative chains. This led to severe interoperability issues, but the economist’s "evolutionary theory" held true: The market moves in the direction of maximum opportunity.</p><p>Looking from an economist's perspective, it's crucial to note that bitcoin's utility as a store of value is still not widely adopted beyond our sector. During the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, for instance, we were curious to see how the crisis (the very kind that Bitcoin was designed for) would stimulate demand for the cryptocurrency. What surfaced instead was that, while some people did buy and HODL, others clearly still preferred to save in their fiat currency and happily accepted fiat currency support payments. Even as these fiat payments, unfortunately, have been severely depreciated due to inflation, widespread global investment and adoption of bitcoin didn’t materialize. </p><p>But what is happening behind closed doors? Bitcoin is entering the treasury reserves of many institutions, banks and countries. They realize its value, and are already using it as a hedge against the next financial or global crisis. </p><p>When considering the future, the pandemic is really an example of why we should be optimistic about the point that Bitcoin has reached. Although it is not the global reserve (yet), it has succeeded. It took Google around 17 years from its founding, and 11 years from its IPO, to reach a <a href="https://disfold.com/company/alphabet-inc/marketcap/">$500 billion market cap</a>. Bitcoin did this <a href="https://www.globaldata.com/data-insights/financial-services/bitcoins-market-capitalization-history/">in less than 12 years</a>, and didn’t sell our data to advertisers to do it. Not only that, but it has advanced significantly while still being a proof-of-work blockchain. There are many other chains that have continuously and expensively iterated, facing diminished returns. Not Bitcoin.</p><p>However, we know it is impossible for Bitcoin to evolve into what everyone wants it to be. There is no way (yet) to create a blockchain that can be a store of value, a mode of transaction and a home for NFTs, tokens and other valuable assets. But if the market seeks a one-stop blockchain for all of these uses, then either Bitcoin will become it or another blockchain will. </p><h2>Bitcoin’s Race To Lose</h2><p>Of course, this “one blockchain to rule them all” thinking drove many people to Ethereum, and its domination has yet to materialize. Bitcoin could learn from Ethereum’s mistakes and use this time to re-define its identity and purpose in the market. For certain, it will remain the first and still most successful example of widespread digital currency that also solves the problem of trust. A truly decentralized, self-sovereign monetary system needs trust. Bitcoin provides that trust — and brilliantly does so with trustlessness. Whatever it evolves into, this is core to its value as a system.</p><p>And Bitcoin, being the freest market that has ever existed, will indeed continue to evolve. Its independence drives its adaptability to changing market conditions, and that is what makes it, still, the blockchain of choice for many. </p><p>Of course, as a free market, we can only influence it through our daily actions. That is not a flaw of Bitcoin. This is its best feature, and the surest predictor of its ongoing successful evolution.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Paolo Tasca.

While many are too scared of thinking about it, a large number of people simply feel that they lack the know-how for setting one up or want to wait until they have children before they feel the need to sort out their afterlives.</p><p>Over the last year or so, I decided to have this “will” discussion with myself, and after much thinking and many hours of research, the answer for the best method of inheritance to establish in my own will seemed obvious: Bitcoin. </p><p>As things stand in the world today, you are bound to end up with issues if you don’t set up a will. Let’s say that you kick the bucket tomorrow without an inheritance plan drawn up. The first thing that might happen is that all of your <a href="https://trustandwill.com/learn/dying-without-a-will">assets could be frozen</a> until the courts take their sweet time digging through every detail of your estate. This alone can take from several months to several years, depending on where you live and the assets that are in your name. If you were married and died intestate (without a will), your spouse might end up having to find an executor, which often costs a lot of money, and then comes the months of paperwork and infighting with long-lost relatives who might suddenly start showing up at your doorstep. Along with all of this drama could come the taxman, ready to act as the grim reaper of the assets you leave behind, often taking huge percentages of your life savings. </p><p>With all this in mind, setting up your will with BTC can solve many problems for those who you leave behind in the land of the living. I will be going through some of my thoughts on this and explaining exactly why I have decided to set up my will with Bitcoin.</p><h2>Advantages Of Bitcoin Over Traditional Assets</h2><p>To me, it all came down to two aspects, with the first being accessibility. With physical assets, you end up having to do more than just paperwork when passing on your property after death. Whether it is gold bars, a cellar of investment-grade whisky or expensive paintings, there is a certain level of expertise needed to move these items from one place to the next and then to look after them properly. </p><p>Bitcoin solves this for me. Here you have an asset that doesn’t need anything other <a href="https://developer.bitcoin.org/devguide/wallets.html">than a 256-bit long combination</a> to be accessed globally, without your next of kin having to wait months to gain access to frozen accounts. This combination can hold all of the value that I wish to pass on, without the need for any fancy, temperature-controlled room or two-ton safe. This way, value can easily be transferred to and accessed by beneficiaries across the globe without the need for intermediaries.</p><p>The other aspect of BTC that makes it good to use as an inheritance device is its privacy aspect. We all know that Bitcoin's blockchain technology is as safe as can be, thus eliminating any security risks, but what about privacy? Sure, it might be possible to track who owns BTC if you know who a wallet belongs to, but as with most of us HODLrs, we tend to keep things on the downlow. </p><p>So, BTC offers security, accessibility and privacy, but it also occurred to me that there might be some issues with this scheme, so I got to listing them and thinking each one through.</p><h2>The Challenges And Risks Of Transferring Bitcoin</h2><p>Security seemed a no-brainer with respect to keeping my stash of coins safe for those I want to leave it to, but then again, how does one transfer said coins or pass a wallet on in a safe way? Setting up a smart contract that will execute upon your demise seemed to be the perfect solution, but then <a href="https://www.reuters.com/science/elon-musks-neuralink-gets-us-fda-approval-human-clinical-study-brain-implants-2023-05-25/">Elon Musk started those human trials with his brain implants</a>, so this idea might still be a few years off. </p><h3>Knowhow</h3><p>So, you might be thinking, go old school and get a safety deposit box at a normal bank to leave your private key in a well-protected spot, and include instructions in your will that will make the situation clear to those you left behind. But even then, there is a certain amount of technical competence that will be required for your beneficiaries to be able to navigate the intricacies of Bitcoin ownership. </p><p>Using BTC has become significantly more straightforward than it was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/justinoconnell/2019/12/23/the-2010s-in-bitcoin-the-year-2010/">back in 2010</a>, but it still requires a level of technical understanding which can pose a challenge for heirs who may not be familiar with cryptocurrencies. The solution here is obvious: Educate your people about the glories of Bitcoin before you end up six feet under.</p><h3>Value And Distribution</h3><p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/052014/why-bitcoins-value-so-volatile.asp">Bitcoin's price fluctuations</a> might be something that could scare people off from even considering this asset as a store of value that can be passed on, but there is no doubt in my mind that one day, even a single satoshi will be worth a pretty penny. </p><p>The problem comes from the fact that, while I am still alive, I want to continue using crypto exchanges to trade and add to my supply of bitcoin. So, how can an ever-evolving bitcoin stack be evenly divided after my death? Well, this is really quite simple, just allocate a percentage of your coins to each beneficiary. This way, you can keep adding to your nest egg, and it doesn’t matter how many coins you have or how volatile the market might be, the right percentage will make it into the right hands.</p><h2>Tools For Bitcoin Inheritance Planning</h2><p>OK, so, in my dive down the BTC-will rabbit hole, I did manage to find a few tips and tools that should be helpful when planning what happens to your stuff once you enter the eternal rest. Let me just briefly touch on two of them:</p><h3>Multi-Signature Wallets</h3><p>This one is perfect for those who are scared that one of their relatives will try to swindle the rest or something like that. One way you might use multi-signature wallets can be in your lawyer and beneficiaries each having to authorize a transaction in order for it to be carried out. This added layer of security can be an easy way of setting up your will without going through too much technical trouble. For me, this multi-signature wallet approach is a fantastic idea and one I have already implemented.</p><h3>Bitcoin Estate Planning Services</h3><p>Believe it or not, I wasn’t the first person to think of this. Specialized bitcoin estate planning services are out there and they offer solutions to securely manage and transfer bitcoin holdings after you breathe your last. These services can help a ton by providing expert guidance and reducing the risk of loss or mishandling of the bitcoin by those who are not too clued in with blockchain technology. While I personally see the value in these services, it’s just not my cup of tea.</p><p>No matter the path you choose to implement a BTC will, one thing that should always accompany your last will and testament is a dossier of comprehensive documentation giving clear instructions on all of your wishes. Clear documentation is essential, and the more concise the instructions, the less room will be available for interpretation and arguments from beneficiaries.</p><h2>Impact Of Bitcoin As A Legacy</h2><p>To me, it all comes down to building a legacy and playing a part in the future of Bitcoin, even from beyond the grave. Democratizing wealth is the perfect way to help push the ideas of a better world through blockchain technology and BTC forward, and by incorporating it into my will, I feel like it helps this cause along. </p><p>I always aim to promote financial inclusivity and would like to empower my heirs with exposure to a transformative asset that has already and will continue to shape the world into something glorious. Supporting Bitcoin in this way also aligns with my belief in the potential of decentralized technologies to reshape the future of finance and society as a whole.</p><p>By choosing Bitcoin as a legacy, I hope to, at the very least, spark conversations about digital assets, educate my heirs, inspire them to explore the opportunities presented by emerging technologies and empower them to approach the evolving financial landscape with confidence.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Konstanin Rabin.

Built using LDK and BDK, LDK Node provides a straightforward interface and an integrated on-chain wallet, allowing developers to quickly and easily establish a Lightning node within a day.</p><p>Unlike its predecessor LDK, which offers extensive customization options but requires a deeper understanding of protocol fundamentals, LDK Node focuses on simplicity and ease of use. With a reduced API surface comprising around 30 API calls, LDK Node simplifies the integration of self-custodial Lightning nodes in various use cases while hiding protocol complexities.</p><p>The initial release of LDK Node includes several design choices and modules. The integrated BDK wallet handles on-chain data, and chain data can be sourced from an <a href="https://github.com/Blockstream/esplora">Esplora</a> server, with support for <a href="https://electrum.org/">Electrum</a> and bitcoind RPC planned for the future. Gossip data can be obtained via Lightning's peer-to-peer network or the Rapid Gossip Sync (RGS) protocol. LDK Node also offers the means to source entropy for Lightning and on-chain wallets, as well as generate and persist entropy bytes to disk.</p><p>LDK Node is specifically designed to facilitate the integration of self-custodial Lightning nodes in mobile applications. Its features are tailored for mobile deployments, with integration options available for Swift, Kotlin, Python and Flutter. By offering language bindings and compatibility with mobile environments, LDK Node aims to simplify the process of deploying self-custodial Lightning nodes on end-user devices.</p><p>Looking ahead, the development team behind LDK Node has already started working on the next release, which will introduce support for sourcing chain data from Electrum or bitcoind RPC and persistence to a Versioned Storage Service (VSS) backend. Integration with the Language Server Protocol (LSP) specification is also in progress. The team is actively considering adding server-grade modules in the future.</p><p>For developers interested in exploring LDK Node, the <a href="https://github.com/lightningdevkit/ldk-node">GitHub repository</a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/ldk-node/0.1.0/ldk_node/">API documentation</a>, and <a href="https://crates.io/">Rust Crate</a> provide further resources. Additionally, <a href="https://github.com/reez/Monday">there is a showcase called Monday Wallet</a>, an example wallet built with LDK Node Swift bindings, demonstrating the capabilities of the library in real-world applications.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwMjY2NTkxMzgyODczMjQx/bitcoin-lightning-network.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Catawba Nation Is Seeking Seasoned Banking Regulators To Help Grow Their Bitcoin-Friendly Jurisdiction]]></title><description><![CDATA[With state-level jurisdictional sovereignty, the Catawba Digital Economic Zone seeks to create an environment conducive to the growth of the digital asset industry.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/catawba-nation-is-seeking-seasoned-banking-regulators-for-bitcoin-friendly-jurisdiction</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/catawba-nation-is-seeking-seasoned-banking-regulators-for-bitcoin-friendly-jurisdiction</guid><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Legal]]></category><category><![CDATA[Banking]]></category><category><![CDATA[Regulation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Legislation]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jun 2023 16:27:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwOTE3NzExNjQ2MTcyNzU3/aa-btc-4.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>The Catawba Nation, a sovereign federally recognized tribal government, has established the <a href="https://catawbadigital.zone/">Catawba Digital Economic Zone</a> (CDEZ), a special jurisdiction within the Catawba Reservation in South Carolina, aimed at empowering emerging digital technology companies, including Bitcoin companies.

The initial announcement had generated excitement within the industry, as the consolidation of these two major custodians was expected to have a significant impact on the industry landscape.</p><p>In the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitgo-announces-preliminary-deal-to-acquire-prime-trust-custody-firm">preliminary announcement</a>, BitGo highlighted its intentions to provide business continuity, long-term stability and secure services to Prime Trust clients. Prime Trust, expressing its enthusiasm for the partnership, believed that the combined company would revolutionize the future of custody services. Jor Law, Prime Trust's Interim CEO and President, stated, "No other company will have the breadth of product and services nor depth of experience that this combined company would have."</p><p>However, after considerable efforts and discussions, BitGo made the “hard decision” to terminate the acquisition.

    </figure><p>In the cryptocurrency world, bold bets and outrageous predictions are not uncommon. And yet, Balaji Srinivasan, a prominent and occasionally-controversial figure in crypto and tech, made major finance headlines when he announced a daring wager that bitcoin <a href="https://qz.com/balaji-srinivasan-lost-1-million-in-a-bizarre-bitcoin-1850399034">would reach a staggering $1 million per coin within 90 days</a>. </p><p>The Bitcoin and larger crypto community immediately began analyzing what drove him to make such a daring statement. Srinivasan predicted this <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1636797265317867520">on March 17, 2023</a> — when bitcoin was trading at $26,000 in the middle of a bearish market. The <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1637625020792049664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1637625020792049664%7Ctwgr%5E5fa19b38c10dd3afc5c1d0bf3ab065dec500e95b%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fembedly.forbes.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext2Fhtmlkey%3D3ce26dc7e3454db5820ba084d28b4935schema%3Dtwitterurl%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fbalajis%2Fstatus%2F1637625020792049664image%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Fi.embed.ly%2F1%2Fimage3Furl3Dhttps253A252F252Fabs.twimg.com252Ferrors252Flogo46x38.png26key3D3ce26dc7e3454db5820ba084d28b4935">terms of the bet</a> stated that if the bitcoin price did not reach $1 million by June 17, 2023, he would pay out $1 million to the other party, Twitter pundit James Medlock. The bet would settle in USDC stablecoin. Srinivasan estimated the odds at forty to one. </p><p>Many were skeptical about the pronouncement, calling it clout chasing, a marketing ploy and even a pump-and-dump scheme. Swan Bitcoin co-founder Cory Klippsten brought up Srinivasan's <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brandonkochkodin/2023/03/20/who-is-balaji-srinivasan-and-why-should-we-care-about-his-1-million-bitcoin-prediction/?sh=3b00ac1a5bd1">history of promoting altcoins</a>, which earned him the ire of Bitcoin Maximalists. Many in the crypto world were dumbfounded yet intrigued enough to investigate what made him take the bet and whether he would be good for the money if he were to lose. </p><p>Along with his audacious prediction, Srinivasan talked about the Federal Reserve's money printing and dollar devaluation. He <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1638731349489238017">warned</a> against the Fed's rate hikes, saying they weren't anti-inflation but <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/balaji-srinivasan-warns-about-the-fed-s-trillion-dollar-printing-press/ar-AA18YPfU">a smokescreen aimed at propping up a banking system</a> on the brink of collapse. </p><p>Fast forward to May 2, 2023, when Srinivasan <a href="https://decrypt.co/138632/balaji-srinivasan-burns-1-million-bitcoin">conceded his bet early</a> and said it had been closed out "by mutual agreement." Medlock <a href="https://twitter.com/jdcmedlock/status/1653453502365196288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1653453502365196288%7Ctwgr%5E9d6fe1ce7435b7059c327214211d5aa604b56bc2%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext2Fhtmlkey%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07schema%3Dtwitterurl%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fjdcmedlock%2Fstatus%2F1653453502365196288image%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Fi.embed.ly%2F1%2Fimage3Furl3Dhttps253A252F252Fabs.twimg.com252Ferrors252Flogo46x38.png26key3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07">acknowledged the payment</a> on his Twitter account. </p><p>In a video <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1653449321185169409">posted and pinned on his Twitter profile</a>, Srinivasan explained the previously-veiled reasoning behind his public relations stunt. Outside of his explanation, this article delves into the possible motivations behind Srinivasan's audacious bet, explores his background and involvement in the crypto industry and reviews the impact of such announcements on the global Bitcoin community. </p><p>Furthermore, I will discuss why, despite the short-term failure, Srinivasan's stunt may hold some validity for the future, exploring the financial and economic conditions in which bitcoin could potentially be an <a href="https://youngandtheinvested.com/how-to-open-crypto-account-for-minors/">ideal long-term investment</a>, and could eventually reach a value of $1 million.</p><h2>Understanding Srinivasan's Background</h2><p>To properly dissect the controversial bet, it's essential to understand its maker's significance within the crypto industry and beyond. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balaji_Srinivasan">Srinivasan is a well-known entrepreneur, technologist and investor</a> who has significantly contributed to the cryptocurrency industry. </p><p>He co-founded 21 Inc., a Bitcoin mining startup that later became Earn.com, a model allowing senders to pay users in crypto to reply to emails. Earn.com was subsequently acquired by Coinbase in April 2018 and launched as Coinbase Earn. Balaji then became the first CTO of Coinbase. Coinbase Earn shut down in 2019.</p><p>Srinivasan is renowned for his deep understanding of technology and ability to identify emerging trends in the industry. He joined venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz as a general partner in 2013. He holds a master’s degree in chemical engineering and in electrical engineering. He has previously taught at Stanford University. He has sometimes been hailed as a polymath because of his multiple involvements in various tech spaces. </p><h2>Possible Motivations Behind The Bitcoin Bet</h2><h3>Attention And Publicity</h3><p>By making such an extravagant bet, Srinivasan courted substantial attention and media coverage. As such, Srinivasan's bet may have been a strategic move to gain visibility for himself and his viewpoints within the crypto community. </p><h3>Challenging Conventional Thinking</h3><p>Through a publicity stunt, Srinivasan may have sought to challenge skeptics and provoke discussions on the transformative power of Bitcoin. Such bold statements can spark debate and encourage critical analysis of cryptocurrencies' underlying technologies and economic principles.</p><h3>Advocacy For Bitcoin</h3><p>While he has been criticized for promoting altcoins and pump-and-dump schemes, Srinivasan remains an ardent supporter of Bitcoin and its potential to disrupt traditional financial systems. The $1 million bet could have been an attempt to showcase his unwavering belief in Bitcoin's future success and encourage others to consider its potential. </p><p>Some critics, however, saw it as an attempt at price manipulation. It could also have been an attempt on his part to regain credibility and position himself as a “mostly Bitcoin” advocate after his previous, alleged attempts at alt-crypto promotion. </p><h3>A Means Of Raising Public Alarm</h3><p>It also may be that he genuinely feels strongly for a cause and saw the bet as a means of starting a robust discussion around a pressing economic issue involving inflation and the benefits of bitcoin as a safe haven asset.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>The Effects Of Exaggerated Bets On Bitcoin Culture</h2><p>Exaggerated bets and pronouncements have become a part of the Bitcoin culture, with enthusiasts and experts constantly making predictions about future prices and market movements. While these bold claims generate excitement and media attention, they can contribute to unrealistic expectations, market manipulation and excessive speculation. </p><p>Influencers need to exercise restraint because the Bitcoin and larger cryptocurrency communities are highly reactive and trade the news. Moreover, investors and participants in the space need to exercise caution, conduct thorough research and base their decisions on sound analysis rather than relying solely on sensational predictions.</p><h2>Burning $1 Million To Prove A Point</h2><p>As noted above, on May 3, 2023, Srinivasan <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1653449321185169409?s=20">posted a video</a> on his official Twitter account with the stark caption, "I burned a million to tell you they're printing trillions."</p><p>Whether this is a genuine and sincere effort to sound the alarm on the U.S. government and the Fed's harmful policies or a mere save for a failure at price prediction is best left to the reader to judge. However, Srinivasan made several valid points that push his argument about hyperinflation and its dangers.</p><p>"I wanted to tell you in a provable way — to send a provable signal — that the economy was wrong. I'm not in the habit of burning a million bucks for the sake of it," he said in the video. "There's something wrong with the economy, and the state is not telling you about it. And things could unwind very fast." </p><p>He then pointed to the speed of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) to the government's subsequent printing of $300 billion. He also mentioned that after SVB, there have been $500 billion in outflows from small lenders to money market funds and big banks. </p><p>He compared the speed of these phenomena to the span from concrete COVID-19 announcements to the sudden implementation of lockdowns — from Ben Bernanke's announcement of a "<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2008/04/10/bernanke-says-us-could-be-facing-a-mild-recession.html">mild recession</a>" in 2008 to a full-fledged global financial crisis, which took just two quarters to unravel. </p><p>"In each of these cases," Srinivasan added, "too slow was being too late."</p><p>Srinivasan argued that in today's U.S. economy, "many things are breaking at once." The most glaring issue, in his opinion, is the U.S. debt ceiling, wherein markets were predicting a high probability of sovereign default. He quoted "Dr. Doom" economist Nouriel Roubini, saying that most U.S. banks are near insolvency. Roubini has confirmed this sentiment, saying that U.S. regional banks <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/nouriel-roubini-us-regional-banks-certainly-face-credit-crunch-2023-5">face a credit crunch</a>. </p><p>Furthermore, he drew parallels to 2008, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/02/briefing/bank-failures-first-republic-bank.html">successive bank failures</a> within a short period and commercial real estate prices crashing by double digits. Traditional safe havens like bonds, he contended, aren't safe. Insurance is under pressure as well. </p><p>He also mentioned the phenomena of <a href="https://money.usnews.com/investing/articles/de-dollarization-what-happens-if-the-dollar-loses-reserve-status">de-dollarization</a>, decreasing U.S. dominance on the global stage, as manifested by the movement of other countries away from the USD as their medium of exchange or store of value. He also pointed out the reallocation movements of smart money and central banks toward gold. </p><p>Afterward, he asked whether anyone sees infinite dollar printing continuing for centuries or whether other — shorter — timelines are more probable. Could the system collapse happen within months, years or decades? He made a probability estimate for each. He proceeded to recommend that if you believe the system collapse may happen sooner than the highly-optimistic span of centuries, you must take appropriate action.</p><p>He then confirmed his reason for the bet: to raise public alarm at his own expense. While this is a radical way to draw attention to a thesis, it does put the spotlight on brewing economic problems and on Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Will Bitcoin Reach $1 Million Anyway?</h2><p>While Srinivasan's bet did not materialize as expected, it does not necessarily discredit the possibility of bitcoin reaching a value of $1 million per coin in the future. Several economic and financial conditions could contribute to such a scenario:</p><h3>Widespread Institutional Adoption</h3><p>Increased acceptance and adoption of bitcoin by institutional investors, banks and governments could drive significant demand and price appreciation. Institutional involvement would provide legitimacy and stability to the market, attracting more capital and increasing the price.</p><h3>Limited Supply And Halving Events</h3><p>Bitcoin's scarcity is a crucial factor in its value proposition. As the supply of new coins decreases due to the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-the-halvening">halving events</a> that occur roughly every four years, the reduction in the inflation rate could exert upward pressure on the price, potentially leading to substantial appreciation.</p><h3>Global Economic Instability</h3><p>Economic crises, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hyperinflation.asp">hyperinflation</a> or a loss of faith in traditional financial systems could prompt individuals and institutions to seek alternative stores of value, such as bitcoin. In such circumstances, the demand for bitcoin as a hedge against inflation or economic uncertainty could skyrocket, potentially driving the price to extraordinary levels.</p><h2>Future Potential</h2><p>Balaji Srinivasan's bold bet on Bitcoin reaching $1 million per coin within 90 days was a daring move that captured the attention of the crypto community and the media. Despite the short-term and possibly intentional failure of the bet, Srinivasan's bet raised essential questions about the future potential of Bitcoin. </p><p>Given the right economic and financial conditions, including widespread institutional adoption, limited supply and global economic instability, bitcoin could very well reach $1 million per coin. But, as with any investment, caution, thorough research, and a long-term perspective are essential when considering the possibilities and risks associated with bitcoin.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Ivan Serrano.

Last week, the Powell-led central bank had decided to temporarily pause rate hikes&nbsp;— the fastest and most aggressive interest rate increases in U.S. history —&nbsp;in their mission to battle the massive <em>price</em> inflation found downstream from the lockdown-induced <em>monetary</em> inflation via stimulus measures. Less than a month away from the announced July launch of FedNow, an inter-bank communication platform, Powell finds himself at a crossroad of monetary policy, regulation and capital requirements before the formal founding of the digital dollar system.</p><h2>The New Dollar: FedNow &amp; USTs, Not Retail CBDCs </h2><blockquote><p>“The status of the dollar as the world’s reserve currency is very important.” <br></p><p>- Jerome Powell, June 21, 2023</p></blockquote><p>The dollar has been digitized for a long time; be it the Zelle or Venmo credits in your retail account, or the dollar balance in your checking account at Bank of America. But generally speaking, the mechanisms behind the transfer of Treasuries and other reserve assets backing these numbers on a screen have remained at the technical agility of a fax machine. The dollar may be the world reserve <em>currency</em>, and can be transacted via intermediaries on obvious centralized banker rails, or less obviously on Ethereum rails via ERC-20 tokens in the form of popular retail stablecoins, but the U.S. Treasuries held by these novel credit creators remain the world reserve <em>asset</em>. These bonds are strictly issued by the U.S. Treasury to be sold to the private sector to create dollars, incentivized with yields dependent on the federal funding rate set by the Federal Reserve. The public has generally feared the direct issuance of some form of retail CBDC (central bank digital currency) due to surveillance concerns and currency seizure from a centralized issuer, but fewer realize both the level of financial surveillance already imposed by banks, never mind the ability for these trusted third parties to censor, blacklist and even expose retail to their counter-party risk. All of these actions are made increasingly possible via the digitization of the currency with an encroaching reliance on centralized payment rails, but up until next month, the communication network for interbank asset trades has remained lossy and slow.</p><p>FedNow, slated to launch next month, serves multiple purposes, but perhaps none as important as creating a much more efficient lever for the Fed to have 365/24/7 control on overnight banking rates, such as SOFR, effectively setting the cost of borrowing short-term liquidity between fractionalized private banks attempting to meet their depositors’ withdrawals. You have probably heard the phrase “reverse repo” once or twice, but the underlying mechanic is often misunderstood. The “repo” stands for a repurchasing agreement; essentially a contract between two entities in which Bank A, with excess dollar liquidity, agrees to lend cash to Bank B, with overnight liquidity needs, via a short-term loan collateralized by Bank B’s assets such as USTs, with the conditions that Bank B will <em>repurchase</em> their securities, usually the next morning (“overnight”), plus a percentage-based fee that Bank A gets to keep. A reverse repo is essentially the same behavior, except that Bank A is bond-rich, cash-poor and thus asking Bank B for dollar-denominated liquidity. This exact scenario came to fruition within the recent regional bank failures in the U.S., and the Fed created new mechanisms to backstop the liquidity needs of the depositors. In the case of the ever-growing reverse repo market, Bank B is routinely the largest American banks, and sometimes even the Fed directly. FedNow is a digital lever, made possible via the internet, for complete centralized control on the overnight rate of borrowing dollars, the necessary transferring of Treasuries between banks, and thus the reshoring of dollar-denominated activity away from the Eurodollar market, and back to the United States within the scope of the Fed and the Treasury. </p><h2>Private-Entity Dollar Issuance</h2><blockquote><p>“We would not support a central bank digital currency for individuals. If we did have a CBDC, it would be intermediated by banks.” <br></p><p>- Jerome Powell, June 21, 2023</p></blockquote><p>Shortly after the fall of FTX last fall, the NY Fed launched their digital dollar pilot program, featuring BNY Mellon, PNC Bank, Citi, HSBC, Mastercard, TD Bank, Truist, U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo, as well as cooperation with SWIFT. Notable within this quorum of too big to fail private sector banks is the inclusion of BNY Mellon, the largest U.S. bank, who holds treasuries for popular stablecoin USDC, and PNC Bank, the former 22.4% owner of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, who only earlier this week filed with the SEC for approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF. The SEC has recently made waves themselves by filing their own notices against Binance and the publicly listed Coinbase for brokering sales of unregistered securities in the form of cryptocurrency tokens. While BUSD, the Binance-issued USD stablecoin, was listed as being an unregistered security, USDC, the Circle-issued USD stablecoin, second in market cap value behind only Tether, was left off the notices, despite listings on both exchanges. Powell took the idea of stablecoins being important to the Fed and the greater U.S. dollar system a step further this morning when he insinuated that not only are stablecoins not a security, they are money. "We do see payment stablecoins as a form of money, and in all advanced economies, the ultimate source of credibility in money is the central bank…We believe it would be appropriate to have quite a robust federal role in what happens in stablecoins going forward."</p><p>He went on to further articulate his views on not needing a direct-issued government dollar, and instead relying on the private sector banks to continue their role of government debt purchasing via USTs in order to create credit via dollars in retail accounts. "We would not support accounts at the Federal Reserve by individuals…such accounts would be managed through the banking system.” In February, the SEC served a Wells Notice to Paxos, the issuer of BUSD, directly limiting Binance’s ability to compete in the dollar creation industry. Via the signatures from the arms of regulation from the Fed, the Treasury, the SEC and even the Department of Justice, the entities allowed to make digital dollars are being hand selected in front of our eyes. In order to continue the cycle of needing to purchase government-issued debt to create dollars, the U.S. government has moved to direct policy, regulatory comment, and even disciplinary action on off-shore dollar creation, changing the landscape for stablecoins, and even the dollar itself, forever, mere moments before the founding of the digital Federal Reserve. </p><h2>Basel III</h2><blockquote><p>“Basel III is an international capital requirement we should go ahead and complete.”<br></p><p> - Jerome Powell, June 21, 2023</p></blockquote><p>As American commercial banks begin to integrate digital assets such as bitcoin and dollar-derivatives such as stablecoins, the need to ensure the public that on-sheet liquidity for speculative action on commodities exists creates a unique opportunity to tilt regulation in the favor of the dollar. Basel III would require any bank wanting to hold bitcoin, other digital assets, or even gold, would also be required to hold an equal-part dollar to dollar-denominated valuation of their investments. This sudden comment on adoption of this international capital requirement would force a net-demand for dollars in the U.S banking system, despite a high monetary inflationary environment. For banks or registered investment vehicles looking to offset inflationary effects by purchasing alternative reserve assets such as bitcoin, this regulation would mean that an increase of valuation of bitcoin in a dollar-pair would also increase the need for dollar liabilities on their balance sheet. Want to run a responsible bank and meet capital requirements while also holding bitcoin on your balance sheet? Better be prepared to also hold a lot of dollars. The idea of the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-birth-of-the-bitcoin-dollar">Bitcoin-Dollar</a> is a parallel to the petro-dollar system, which was upheld from the gold window closing via the Nixon shock until only somewhat recently. By creating a monopoly on the in’s and out’s of oil to strictly U.S. dollars, the U.S. was essentially able to re-peg their inflating dollar to an ever-demanded energy commodity, and create a mass buyer of dollars. As the Fed and SEC circle the waters on both regional banks and private issuers of stablecoins, the downstream effect of Basel III will create permanent demand for dollars, even in a “hyperbitcoinization” environment. Powell mentioned the Fed doesn’t have specifics on proposals for capital requirements at this time, but that there will be a future proposal that comes to the Fed board later this summer.</p><h2>BlackRock ETF</h2><blockquote><p>“Let me tell you, it’s not who the President is. It’s who’s controlling the wallet of the President.” <br></p><p>- Serge Varlay, BlackRock Recruiter</p></blockquote><p>The recent application filing from BlackRock, an investment firm with assets under management totalling $10 trillion, has kicked off a filing spree from other institutional asset managers in the race for the first approved exchange-traded fund offering exposure to bitcoin. WisdomTree, Bitwise, and Invesco have all since filed to the SEC seeking to launch Bitcoin ETFs, despite a universal rejection of every spot Bitcoin ETF application previously filed, notably including NYDIG, CBOE, and Fidelity. The newly found resurgence in confidence of approval perhaps comes downstream of BlackRock’s near perfect record of getting ETFs approved, sitting at a 575 to 1 success rate. Within iSHARES Bitcoin Trust Form <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1980994/000143774923017574/bit20230608_s1.htm">S-1</a> Registration Statement was their disclosure of using Coinbase for bitcoin custody, as well as a notice of potential conflict of interest within an affiliate of theirs acting as investment manager to a money market fund, the Circle Reserve Fund, which the issuer of USDC uses to “hold cash, U.S. Treasury bills, notes and other obligations insured or guaranteed as to principal and interest by the U.S. Treasury and repurchase agreements secured by such obligations or cash, which serves as reserves backing USDC stablecoins." It later states that “an affiliate of the Sponsor [BlackRock] has a minority equity interest in the issuer of USDC." The S-1 includes a line stating the “price of bitcoin may be affected due to stablecoins (including Tether and USDC), the activities of stablecoin issuers and their regulatory treatment." The Cash Custodian and Trust Administrator of the BlackRock ETF is listed as the aforementioned digital dollar pilot program partner Bank of New York Mellon.</p><p>While ETFs are often used as a mechanism to short commodities by large financial institutions, the recent signaling from the most important U.S. regulatory bodies reveals a real possibility of increased digital dollar creation and an increased purchasing power of the demand-inelastic reserve asset, bitcoin. There is perhaps no larger investment firm than BlackRock, and no larger banking entity than Bank of New York Mellon. There are few government bodies more influential on the global economy than the Fed and the SEC. </p><p>Welcome to institutional adoption.

A Delaware-based subsidiary of Valkyrie Investments Inc. has <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1841175/000138713123007682/valkyrie-s1a_062123.htm#valkyries1aa003">filed an updated spot ETF proposal</a>, altering the intended exchange to Nasdaq and changing the ticker to $BRRR.</p><p>The company, which <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/valkyrie-launches-bitcoin-futures-etf-on-nasdaq-exchange">already has a</a> bitcoin futures ETF product listed on the Nasdaq, is likely to have been closely observing the developments in the industry, with a particular focus on other firms entering the ETF market. Notably, BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/blackrock-nears-filing-bitcoin-etf-application-leveraging-coinbase-custody">filed a spot bitcoin ETF application</a>, perhaps taking advantage of recent regulatory scrutiny to facilitate its entry into the market.

This application signals the increasing competition among firms aiming to launch bitcoin ETFs, as they recognize the demand for regulated investment products in the space, along with the first-movers advantage possible.</p><p>In addition, Bitwise <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1671582463489974278?s=20">filed a 19b-4 form</a> to renew their spot bitcoin ETF filing, while Invesco <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1671328943104831488?s=20">renewed their filing</a> for a spot bitcoin ETF.</p><p>As firms like Valkyrie, BlackRock, Bitwise, Invesco and WisdomTree enter the race for an ETF approval, they all equally aim to provide investors with more accessible and regulated avenues to participate in the bitcoin market. These developments underscore the continued growth and maturation of the bitcoin industry, with ETFs emerging as an important tool for investors seeking exposure to bitcoin in a regulated manner, albeit at the cost of certain properties inherent only to native bitcoin.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyODY4MzAyMTgyMjI5NzEy/markets-price-chart.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[CleanSpark Acquires Two Bitcoin Mining Campuses, Allowing For Expansion Of Hash Rate And Mining Capacity]]></title><description><![CDATA[Over 6,000 latest-generation mining machines will be hosted, enhancing mining efficiency and revenue prospects.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/cleanspark-acquires-two-bitcoin-mining-campuses</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/cleanspark-acquires-two-bitcoin-mining-campuses</guid><category><![CDATA[Public Miners]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[CleanSpark]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2023 13:54:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk4ODIyMzE0NjgxMzEzMDMx/img_20230620_185701_277.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>CleanSpark Inc., a prominent Bitcoin mining company, has announced its plans to acquire two turnkey bitcoin mining campuses in Dalton, Georgia, for $9.3 million in an all-cash deal.

It also continues to position us as one of the most power-efficient miners on an energy-per-hashrate basis,” said Zach Bradford, CEO of CleanSpark. “These two additional sites are testament to our deepening ties with rural communities in Georgia and the regional expertise we are developing there as a large, flexible load. Importantly, our efforts are generating economic growth for the suburban and rural areas where our operations are located.” </p><p>Gary A. Vecchiarelli, CFO of CleanSpark, highlighted the financial impact of the acquisition, stating that it will be immediately beneficial to the company. “Importantly, this acquisition is fully paid for from our existing cash reserves and we expect it to almost immediately start driving revenue to our bottom line,” Vecchiarelli said.</p><p>The company’s purchase comes as Bitcoin inches closer to the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/halving">halving</a> in 2024, in which miners will see the bitcoin reward for their efforts cut in half. If a company relies heavily on newly minted bitcoin as a source of income, their revenue will decrease unless they increase their mining efficiency or the price of bitcoin rises significantly.

I couldn't believe my eyes when I looked at the price increases over the past few years after our conversation and I wondered: Will this alternative currency continue to rise in value, or is it a big Ponzi scheme that will soon collapse in on itself?</p><p>I started to read up on the subject and quickly realized that the influencers on Twitter were often playing with the emotions of their audiences — with fear and greed, to name the most common ones. I could hardly believe some of the exaggerated posts, and yet they drew me in.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/BTC_Archive/status/1379127189321420808"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>It was obvious to me that social media influenced private individuals in their actions when it came to Bitcoin. In my studies, I learned about many theories and models in media psychology, which I can apply to the Bitcoin market and which might help others do the same.</p><h2>Media Psychology Concepts And Bitcoin Twitter</h2><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uses_and_gratifications_theory">uses-and-gratifications theory</a> assumes that recipients choose the medium that can best satisfy their needs. Depending on the medium, a person seeks information, entertainment, personal identity (reinforcement of one's own values) or integration and social interaction (exchanges among like-minded people). For me, I mix all four motives right away. </p><p>The involvement concept, which suggests that a recipient can still be involved with the content of an article even days after reading it, if that person is directly affected by the developments or the views represented. However, this does not mean that attitudes can be permanently changed. The more involved a judging individual is in a topic, the less he or she can be influenced by persuasion from other opinions. The interplay between the emotions of greed and fear and the resulting experienced tension diminishes over time and with experience. </p><p>In my environment, everyone, without exception, has confirmed this phenomenon. After your first bitcoin purchase, for instance, you are susceptible to being easily manipulated. With every additional hour that you deal with the matter, your opinion becomes stronger. You may accept price distortions more and more easily and, in the meantime, see the incentive to buy sats at a lower price.</p><p>Remaining mindful of why you are on Bitcoin Twitter in the first place, and how the content there is impacting you, will help you navigate it.</p><h2>How To Handle Bitcoin Twitter</h2><p>The enormous price gains are, in my opinion, the strongest narrative that draws retail investors into the bitcoin market. The most common type of posts that I see on Bitcoin Twitter are positive price forecasts. These generate clicks, have the potential to trigger fear of missing out (FOMO) and entice private investors to make rash purchases.</p><p>How strongly an individual reacts to information with positive connotations, or to information with negative connotations in a phase of strong price decay, and whether an action results from this, ultimately depends on the motive and the experienced emotions of a recipient, as well as the behavior of the influencers consumed. But the natural human trait of being guided by emotions means that new investors could pay the highest prices at the end of an upswing and sell these positions at losses when prices correct, in fear of a total collapse. This is why anyone entering the Bitcoin space this way should keep in mind the psychological factors at play.</p><p>One suggestion I have is to remain strong-minded. If someone’s investment goes into the red, their mood usually dips. But losses and gains don't materialize if you don't cash out. But I believe that four out of five people don't hold to this, emotionally. That's where you have to be tough as nails. There is an age-old wisdom that should be drilled into every private investor: You can never catch two things, the top and the bottom. "Simply doing nothing" is historically best in a market that is going up in the medium to long term.</p><p>Another valuable lesson for me was to realize that, in today's globally-connected world, it has become increasingly difficult to separate the clickbaiters and scammers from the valuable content with strong communities. This means that someone who wants to learn about Bitcoin via Twitter should first do the work of "separating the junk from the good sources" in their own research. An investment should never be made based on just one opinion or source.</p><h2>Manipulation Via Media</h2><p>Manipulation via media is by no means a new phenomenon and media history shows that it can hardly be eliminated with regulation. </p><p>But social media accelerates the impact of contributions and enlarges spheres of influence, accentuating the problem. My goal is to motivate critical engagement with media, even knowing that, globally, this is a difficult endeavor. After all, the ability to critically examine media and one's own emotional reactions would be a considerable benefit in all areas of life.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Thierry Berger.

The filings by BlackRock and WisdomTree reflect the industry's push to provide investors with regulated options for participating in the bitcoin market, albeit at the cost of properties exclusive to sovereign bitcoin usage.</p><p>The consecutive filings by BlackRock and WisdomTree highlight the increasing recognition of Bitcoin's potential in traditional finance.

Instead, it serves as a marketplace where firms can execute trades. This eliminates the risk of bank-run style failings that the industry witnessed in 2022 with <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-ceo-resigns">FTX</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/celsius-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy">Celsius</a> and others.</p><p>The development comes just as American exchange <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/coinbase-sued-by-the-sec-for-securities-violations">Coinbase</a> and worldwide exchange <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/sec-sues-cryptocurrency-exchange-binance-alleging-securities-laws-violations">Binance</a> face lawsuits from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. While the crackdown indicated increasing scrutiny from regulators, it seems that larger institutions are viewing this as an opportunity to swoop in for market share. These firms often have close ties to regulators and are much more effective at complying with regulations as a result of their scale, and as such, the current environment is seemingly ripe for disruption.</p><p>Indeed, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/blackrock-nears-filing-bitcoin-etf-application-leveraging-coinbase-custody">a recent filing by BlackRock</a>, the world’s largest asset management firm with more than $8 trillion under management, for a spot Bitcoin ETF is another sign that these institutions see the current environment as an opportunity for expansion into the sector. </p><p>SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has repeatedly <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1541421073262120960?s=20">claimed</a> that bitcoin is <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1629573858104582144?s=20">not a security</a>, but a commodity, effectively keeping it out of the realm of SEC regulation. As a result, institutions like BlackRock may perceive bitcoin to be the safest cryptocurrency to offer products for, although this newly announced EDX exchange will feature other cryptocurrencies as well.</p><p>Overall, the development indicates that BlackRock is not the sole major traditional finance institution paying attention to bitcoin — everyone wants their slice of the pie, and regulators have served up that pie fresh out of the oven.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NDg4MTA1ODc5ODczMDI5/economic-chart-analysis.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Brink Renews Grant For Sebastian Falbesoner's Review Of BIP324 To Enhance Bitcoin's Censorship-Resistance]]></title><description><![CDATA[The focus of Falbesoner’s work seeks to bring greater privacy to Bitcoin node operators through encryption.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/brink-renews-grant-for-sebastian-falbesoners-review-of-bip324</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/brink-renews-grant-for-sebastian-falbesoners-review-of-bip324</guid><category><![CDATA[brink]]></category><category><![CDATA[encryption]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technical]]></category><category><![CDATA[Grants]]></category><category><![CDATA[Privacy]]></category><category><![CDATA[development]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bip]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jun 2023 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkxOTg4NDM3NTk3ODg5OTkx/20220830_better-the-four-pillars-of-bitcoin-adoption---stefan-ristic.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Bitcoin research and development center, Brink, has <a href="https://brink.dev/blog/2023/06/20/bip324/">announced</a> the renewal of a year-long grant for Sebastian Falbesoner, also known as theStack. “As part of his grant renewal application, he emphasized the importance of BIP324 Version 2 P2P transport and why he plans to spend his review time on the project,” the announcement read.</p><p>BIP324 aims to address the vulnerability of Bitcoin's peer-to-peer (P2P) communication layer, where messages are currently transmitted unencrypted.

Additionally, an extra chunk of random bytes, known as "garbage," is exchanged during connection initiation to further obfuscate the size of packets, hindering detection by potential attackers.</p><p>Sebastian expressed his fascination with BIP324's pseudorandom approach, stating, "If we imagine a world where this v2 encrypted transport protocol is used predominantly ... censorship of any Bitcoin participant on the network level will be significantly harder." He highlights that deep packet inspection and man-in-the-middle attacks would become far more challenging to execute.</p><p>Recognizing the significance of BIP324 for ensuring Bitcoin's censorship-resistance on the P2P layer, Brink has extended Sebastian's part-time grant for another year. Sebastian plans to conduct thorough code reviews, test the remaining BIP324 pull requests, and run a publicly accessible BIP324-compatible node once a functional pull request is available.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkxOTg4NDM3NTk3ODg5OTkx/20220830_better-the-four-pillars-of-bitcoin-adoption---stefan-ristic.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bitcoin Is Actually A Store Of Energy, And That Changes Everything]]></title><description><![CDATA[Serving as a currency backed by energy of any source, bitcoin has solved problems that have been tied to money throughout history.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-is-currency-that-stores-energy-unlocking-the-future</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-is-currency-that-stores-energy-unlocking-the-future</guid><category><![CDATA[energy consumption]]></category><category><![CDATA[Fiat]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[The history of money]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Shane Neagle]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jun 2023 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyMzg0NjM5NzQwOTQ2MDc3/20220916_better-five-factors-making-bitcoin-miners-unique-energy-consumers---jaran-mellerud.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Shane Neagle, the editor-in-chief of “The Tokenist.”</em></p><p>Time and time again, we see the mainstream media <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/09/business/bitcoin-mining-electricity-pollution.html">taking advantage</a> of Bitcoin’s perceived exploit: energy consumption. For the Bitcoin network, this path has become all too familiar.</p><p>Just look at what happened in May 2021, when Elon Musk effectively “broke” bitcoin’s price as Tesla <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1392602041025843203">announced</a> it would no longer accept BTC as payment, citing environmental concerns. The price of a single bitcoin <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/05/13/bitcoin-tesla-elon-musk-climate/">dropped by nearly $8,000</a> in the two hours following the announcement. There are countless similar cases as well.</p><p>But the takeaway is this: It’s very clear that the perception of Bitcoin’s fundamentals goes far beyond the security of the network, the soundness of the code and the asset’s limited supply. Bitcoin’s energy consumption plays a role, too. So big of a role, that it significantly impacts not just the price of bitcoin, but its regulatory framework as well. For better or for worse, this really can’t be argued.</p><p>But what if Bitcoin’s energy consumption was <em>actually</em> a good thing? What if Bitcoin functioned as a “store of energy” that provides a superior alternative to any monetary system we’ve ever seen?</p><p>Fortunately, the concept of an energy-backed currency is not as radical or novel as people may think — it has been around for more than a century. But the necessary conditions (i.e., the technology) did not yet exist to facilitate such a game-changing development for civilization.</p><p>That technology now exists, however, and it’s called Bitcoin. Let me explain.</p><h2>Money And ‘Life Energy’</h2><p>The evolution of human civilization largely centers upon the resolution of one key question: How do we appraise the true value of goods and services?</p><p>More specifically, how do we assess such value in the most uniform and effortless manner possible?</p><p>Consider the era of <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/the-bottom-line/managing-your-finances/a-history-of-the-trade-and-barter-system">ancient barter systems</a>, when a uniform system of fiat currency had yet to be conceived. Exchanging crops or livestock for services was commonplace. However, this system was fraught with inefficiencies, as it was heavily reliant on the mutual coincidence of wants. Consider a fisherman looking to trade his fish — but only for salt which he needed to preserve his future catch from spoiling. Any individual looking to trade for fish, must now have precisely what the fisherman wanted: salt.</p><p>In such a scenario, it’s easy to see how the principle of supply and demand is skewed.</p><p>Determining an equitable exchange for unique, non-fungible items poses a distinctive challenge. How do we ensure that both parties are duly rewarded for the energy they’ve invested — their “life energy” — in producing the product or service they’re selling?</p><p>This concept of “life energy” refers to the time, effort and creative energy that individuals pour into their work. Every human has a finite time span that they convert into tangible, productive output — a <em>measurable</em> form of energy.</p><p>But in this system of bartering, <em>life energy</em> isn’t appropriately accounted for. Rather, external factors heavily influence the value of a product or service — frequently to the detriment of the life energy devoted to its production.</p><p>Ideally, we need a system that allows for the accumulation and storage of this expenditure of energy — which we can refer to as “surplus energy” — and its associated value.</p><p>The advantages here go far beyond the individual who expended such energy. The metaphorical lifeblood of any economy is this concept of “surplus energy.” If this flow is impeded or clots, it leads to a less vibrant, stagnant economy. If it’s properly stored and fluid, it can lead to innovation and breakthroughs which benefit the society at large.</p><p>If we don't establish accurate mechanisms, capturing and storing surplus energy or value becomes impossible.</p><p>Hence, it becomes vital to measure this energy output in the most streamlined manner possible, to ensure fair compensation for — and ability to capitalize on — the energy expended. In this respect, a significant landmark in civilization’s journey was the evolution from bartering to commodity money, eventually leading to the use of portable, interchangeable and standardized metal coins.</p><h2>A Historical Devaluation Of Life Energy</h2><p>The Roman Empire built itself on economic efficiency by minimizing money friction. Its blood was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denarius">denarius currency</a>, molded out of the limited supply of precious metals. The limited nature of the denarius allowed for it to serve as a store of value.</p><p>Concurrently, the denarius’ portability as a store of value allowed it to spread across every corner of the empire, easily transported and traded by various merchants. Consequently, the economic circulatory system <a href="https://www.moneymuseum.com/en/for-sunflower/the-fall-of-the-roman-denarius-460">overflowed with energy</a>. As the friction within the exchange of goods and services was minimized, new specialized labor markets could form, which increased productivity and innovation.</p><p>In monetary terms, all was good. The Roman civilization achieved a commodity currency which facilitated economic expansion. Such a standardized currency, portable and limited as it was, stored and efficiently captured Roman energy into productivity and economic growth. </p><p>Until it didn't, by decree.</p><p>As each Roman emperor desired to expend more energy than the currency allowed, they started to erode the denarri’s store of value. </p><p>The denarius remained portable and fungible, yet it began to falter in its ability to accurately represent people's life energy outputs. The silver content of each denarius became smaller and smaller, eroding the currency’s ability to maintain value and, ultimately, purchasing power.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Today, we understand this as inflation. With each currency debasement cycle, people lost confidence that their life’s energy output was properly measured, quite <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042015/how-does-money-supply-affect-inflation.asp">similar to what’s happening today</a>:</p><figure>

    </figure><p>The United States is in a peculiar historic position in which <a href="https://kenaninstitute.unc.edu/kenan-insight/how-the-u-s-exports-inflation-through-a-strong-dollar/">it can export domestic inflation</a> thanks to the status of the dollar as the global reserve currency (GRC). Therefore, wages can keep growing at an inflationary pace. But, <a href="https://tokenist.com/the-us-debt-ceiling-crisis-explained/">as debt ceilings have become debt ladders</a>, no one knows for sure for how long this will be sustainable.</p><p>And it is definitely not sustainable in many other countries with double- and even <a href="https://bigthink.com/strange-maps/triple-digit-inflation/">triple-digit</a> inflation rates.</p><h2>Money: What Needs To Be Fixed?</h2><p>So, what patterns can we observe from our monetary history?</p><p>First, to properly measure life’s energy outputs, the gauge needs to be fungible and standardized, facilitating a feasible calculation of the value of nonfungible goods and services. Second, the gauge needs to simultaneously <em>store value</em> and <em>be</em> <em>portable</em>.</p><p>These baseline elements provide people with a tool to accurately transform their limited time and energy — life energy — into a productive, well-compensated energy output.</p><p>When we look at all modern fiat currencies, their stores of value rest on shaky grounds. The problem is, central banks have replaced emperors — but their decrees are no less disruptive.</p><p>At a fundamental level, the exchange of funds between employers and employees is the exchange of energy. But neither employers nor employees control this compensatory energy’s current(cy). That energy’s current is provided through <em>currency</em> — and it’s entirely controlled by central banks.</p><p>Thus, it is central banks that uniquely possess the authority to modify that energy current over time, echoing the practice of ancient Roman emperors.</p><p>The biggest influence on a currency’s store of value is its supply and issuance schedule. Central banks and Roman emperors alike have had a tendency to radically change available supply, negatively impacting this attribute.</p><p>In turn, this negatively impacts people’s ability to capitalize on their expended energy.</p><h2>Energy Currency As New Milestone Technology</h2><p>From bartering and commodities, to metal coins and fiat paper currency, history’s monetary experiments have delivered actionable conclusions. </p><p>Alongside portability, maintaining the integrity of the currency’s store of value is of the utmost importance. For this to be achievable, it must not rely on arbitrary decrees.</p><p>And this is precisely the revolution Satoshi Nakamoto brought with his <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">Bitcoin white paper</a>. The trust must be removed from the centralized entities which have complete control over monetary systems — and the ability for individuals to capitalize on their expended energy through labor: “an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust,” as Nakamoto <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">put it</a>.</p><p>The question then shifts to: How do we <em>secure</em> that new component of trust?</p><p>Past intellectuals have argued for backing money with units of energy. Namely, in John Maynard Keynes’ <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/collected-writings-of-john-maynard-keynes/keyness-early-lectures/37A3CBC28BAA6C04725F688B410E3E5D">lectures of 1912 to 1913</a>, which provided the intellectual framework for a means of measuring money “in terms of units of electrical energy.”</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Bitcoin: An Energy-Secured System Of Energy Transference</h2><p>In the case of Bitcoin, that new component of trust is secured through <em>energy</em>.</p><p>Bitcoin is not only portable but digitally portable, complementing our digital era. It’s not merely scarce, but its scarcity is defined in an energy-agnostic way. This links back to Ford’s dream of an energy-backed currency, but with a fundamental difference. Ford’s envisioned energy currency, tied to the world’s largest power plant, would have been susceptible to vulnerabilities associated with centralization. In contrast, Bitcoin leverages energy from any source available.</p><p>The decentralized nature of computing power creates a resilient and robust system. It is through this energy itself that the Bitcoin network secures this new component of trust — cryptographic proof.</p><p>In this light, it is no coincidence that <a href="https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1330150691671846919?lang=ta">Michael Saylor</a> paints the vision of Bitcoin as the solution to the problem of how to store energy over time and across space.</p><p>Returning to one of the first points mentioned, where Bitcoin’s perception goes beyond its own fundamentals, two questions remain: How durable should Bitcoin be to external factors? Are there any legitimate threats out there?</p><p>Just look at new technology which is developing at breakneck speeds. Artificial intelligence (AI) is anticipated to heavily impact the finance world — from <a href="https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/book/rf-lit-review/2020/rflr-artificial-intelligence-in-asset-management.pdf">long-term investing</a> and portfolio management to <a href="https://thetradinganalyst.com/human-vs-ai-trading-signals/">shorter-term options trading</a>. Yet with the development and mass integration of AI, reality and illusion will become intertwined. Separating the two will become an arduous task.</p><p>How will such significant innovations impact Bitcoin?</p><p>Bitcoin is poised to endure such technological revolutions. The immutable nature of the blockchain allows for a degree of verifiability which the development of AI will create a greater need for. Yet even more importantly, Bitcoin advocates see how Bitcoin represents something of a vocation, rather than an asset merely for speculation and profit. This type of “larger than life” support will only help Bitcoin to endure life-changing innovations, political regime changes or any other existential “threat” that may arise in the future.</p><p>Yet there remains an ongoing absence of the proper framework when it comes to Bitcoin’s energy consumption, as I’ve tried to articulate here.</p><p>According to a recent poll, for example, <a href="https://www.creditdonkey.com/buy-bitcoin.html">76% of investors</a> want BTC to be more “environmentally friendly” — which misses the mark when it comes to the relationship between Bitcoin’s energy use (or, in other words, its means of securing the network) and our ability to effectively capitalize on the life energy we devote.</p><p>With its distinctive ability to store and transfer energy, the Bitcoin network fixes this dilemma.</p><p>Not only is the network secured by energy, but it has the potential to effectively enable individuals to properly capitalize on the use of their life energy. This means Bitcoin has already ventured into the unprecedented territory of an energy currency — not just for the benefit of the individual, but of society at large.</p><p>History is here and the journey has just begun.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Shane Neagle.

While Bitcoin Layer 2 options like the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/lightning-network">Lightning Network</a> offer low transaction fees, it may not be practical for Bitcoin hodlers to migrate their entire holdings to Lightning, as many Lightning wallets are custodial, meaning users must rely on a trusted third party to hold their funds. While this custodial approach may be suitable for small amounts that users are likely to spend, many Bitcoiners will feel uneasy about not having self-custody of their bitcoin. Additionally, achieving self-custody of a substantial stack on Lightning would require significant technical knowledge and still necessitate dealing with the Bitcoin timechain. However, the appeal of low transaction fees has driven some Bitcoiners to explore alternative solutions.</p><p>A particular challenge faced by Bitcoiners who follow a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) stacking strategy is withdrawing small amounts, ranging from $5 to $100 worth of bitcoin, from exchanges to the timechain. This practice often leads to a buildup of numerous and small unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs), complicating coin control management and potentially leading to higher fees when combining UTXO inputs for larger transactions. Consequently, alternative low-fee options have emerged to address this issue.</p><p><a href="https://help.blockstream.com/hc/en-us/articles/900000630846-How-do-I-get-Liquid-Bitcoin-L-BTC-">Liquid-Bitcoin (L-BTC)</a> on Blockstream's <a href="https://blockstream.com/liquid/">Liquid sidechain</a> and <a href="https://wbtc.network/">wrapped bitcoin (WBTC)</a>, an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum network, are two prominent alternatives that aim to enhance liquidity and functionality while, in theory, minimizing transaction fees.

While there have been no major reported failures, risks exist and users should exercise caution and perform due diligence when engaging with L-BTC or WBTC.</p><p>It bears noting that 11 of the 15 Liquid Federation functionaries would need to collude in bad faith to rug-pull users from their pegged-in bitcoin, thereby, reducing the possibility of acting in bad faith. The way by which a rug-pull would take place in WBTC is less certain, but with only a single custodian of their locked-in BTC, a central point of failure is one of WBTC’s major weaknesses. What is evident is that for both L-BTC and WBTC, there are increased risk trade-offs from self-custody.</p><p>From a Bitcoin-only perspective, using L-BTC or WBTC may raise ethical implications, as it could be seen as deviating from the original vision of Bitcoin as a standalone, decentralized network. Bitcoiners could argue that tokenizing Bitcoin undermines the core principles of the network and introduces additional risks and complexities. They emphasize the importance of Bitcoin's sovereignty, security, and censorship resistance.</p><p>However, proponents of L-BTC and WBTC may contend that tokenized versions of bitcoin can enhance liquidity, scaling, and functionality, thus benefiting the overall ecosystem. Both tokens could be alternatives that allow bitcoin hodlers to access the advantages of other blockchain networks — such as faster transaction confirmations, interoperability with dApps, and additional financial instruments.</p><p>WBTC has an advantage over L-BTC when accessing other crypto ecosystems and activity. However, Blockstream's Liquid Network provides a platform where L-BTC can be exchanged for various digital assets, including stablecoins like <a href="https://help.blockstream.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005355626-How-do-I-get-Liquid-based-Tether-USDt-">USDT (tether)</a> and <a href="https://blog.blockstream.com/en-bull-bitcoin-launches-l-cad-on-the-liquid-network/">L-CAD (Canadian dollar-denominated gift certificates issued by Bull Bitcoin)</a>. This feature enables users to access different digital assets and expands their options for trading, remittances, and other financial activities within the Liquid ecosystem.</p><p>Additionally, as per previous announcements, <a href="https://blog.blockstream.com/el-salvador-to-issue-1b-in-tokenized-bonds-on-the-liquid-network/">the Liquid Network will be utilized for the issuance of the El Salvador Bitcoin Bond</a> (recently amended to a <a href="https://youtu.be/DnlA1vyxRBc?t=917">Volcano Mining Equity</a>). This demonstrates the network's capability to facilitate the issuance and management of tokenized financial instruments, further expanding the use cases beyond simple asset exchange.</p><p>Everything considered, L-BTC is a superior option compared to WBTC due to its distinct advantages over transaction fees and the speed of transfer times. While WBTC relies on the Ethereum (and Tron) network, which are prone to frequent <a href="https://crypto.news/ethereum-gas-fees-spike-to-a-one-year-high-amidst-pepe-craze/">congestion issues and high fees</a>, L-BTC provides faster and more cost-effective transactions. By leveraging the Liquid Network, L-BTC offers low fees, quicker confirmations, and improved scalability, making it a more efficient and practical solution for willing bitcoin holders. With L-BTC, users can enjoy the benefits of Bitcoin's main chain while bypassing the limitations and challenges associated with WBTC on the Ethereum network.</p><p>To make the most of L-BTC for the purpose of low fees, it is well-suited for short-term and medium-term holding strategies.</p><h2>Three-Step Process To Leverage The Benefits Of L-BTC</h2><ol><li>Withdrawal from exchange to L-BTC: There are a number of <a href="https://help.blockstream.com/hc/en-us/articles/900000629383">exchanges which support L-BTC</a> and allow you to withdraw directly to a wallet that supports L-BTC (<a href="https://blockstream.com/green/">Green Wallet</a> or <a href="https://aquawallet.io/">Aqua</a>). This allows you to bypass additional conversions or transfers, ensuring that you retain the advantages of L-BTC throughout the process. An additional advantage is an option to store L-BTC in cold storage with a hardware device such as <a href="https://blockstream.com/jade/">Blockstream Jade</a>.</li><li>Wait for ideal UTXO denomination: Keep adding to your L-BTC stack until you accumulate a sufficient amount of satoshis to create a desirable unspent transaction output (UTXO) denomination. This step helps optimize coin control and simplifies future transactions.</li><li>Peg out using SideSwap or a similar service: When transaction fees are low you should peg out to reappropriate the funds back to the Bitcoin main chain. You can utilize a service like <a href="https://sideswap.io/">SideSwap</a>, which facilitates the conversion of L-BTC to BTC, taking into account the <a href="https://sideswap.io/faq/fees/">conversion fee of around 0.1%</a>. It's important to consider this fee when planning your transactions to ensure accurate cost calculations.</li></ol><p>By following this flow, you can effectively utilize L-BTC for short-term and medium-term hodling, and take advantage of its low fees and faster transaction confirmations. This approach can be particularly useful in a permanent high-fees environment, where L-BTC offers a cost-effective solution compared to on-chain Bitcoin transactions.</p><p>Currently, popular Bitcoin exchanges like Swan, Strike, CoinCorner, Relai, Amber, River and Bitonic do not currently have support for L-BTC withdrawals. However, just like many have integrated Lightning withdrawals, they will likely respond to a demand for L-BTC.</p><p>For Bitcoin hodlers seeking an alternative to the main chain, L-BTC offers a compelling option compared to WBTC on Ethereum. L-BTC's advantage lies in its utilization of bitcoin itself, ensuring a closer alignment with the principles and vision of the Bitcoin network. By leveraging L-BTC, users can benefit from faster confirmations, enhanced privacy features, and compatibility with other assets on the Liquid sidechain. From the perspective of preserving the integrity of Bitcoin's core principles, L-BTC stands as a preferable choice for Bitcoin hodlers seeking alternative low-fee options while maintaining a direct connection to the Bitcoin network.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk4Nzc2MTkxODMyODI3MjQz/liquid-bitcoin-versus-wrapped-bitcoin-feature-image-w_text.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Ordinals-Focused Infighting Is Bad For Bitcoin]]></title><description><![CDATA[“Ditch the wizard hats, and turn off the laser eyes.

    </figure><p>Over the last few weeks, I’ve noticed a disappointing trend that has divided the Bitcoin community into two warring factions. On one side, the “Bitcoin transaction maximalists” believe that Bitcoin Layer 1 should be used purely to process transactions. On the other side of the spectrum, the “Ordinal enjoooyers” want to use Bitcoin’s Layer 1 to inscribe arbitrary data and generally want to experiment with the base layer.</p><p>I personally don’t have a dog in this fight. I think both sides make compelling arguments for their use cases. The purpose of this article isn’t to say one is right and the other side is wrong, it is to raise the alarm about what happens if the infighting continues and how this could hinder the movement.</p><h2>Sympathy For Bitcoin Transaction Maximalists</h2><p>The current schism in the Bitcoin community appeared right when Ordinals showed up on the scene in <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-are-bitcoin-ordinals">January 2023</a>. The Ordinals protocol essentially allowed for NFTs on Bitcoin. Until then, NFTs were generally left to the Ethereum crowd and their ilk. Ordinals changed that dynamic and brought the creators who were minting NFTs on Ethereum to Bitcoin, and this new influx brought new developers and, of course, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoins-high-fees-create-controversy-and-challenges">higher transaction fees</a>.</p><p>As we all know, the Bitcoin blockchain is not optimized for speed. This is why we have the Lightning Network and other Layer 2 solutions. The purpose of mainchain Bitcoin is to transfer value ultra securely and consistently.<a href="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/bitcoin-uptime/"> </a>The Bitcoin network <a href="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/bitcoin-uptime/">has an uptime of 99.98%</a>, which is a remarkable achievement. This is exactly what we want in a base money that can be trusted: not to debase over time.</p><p>When new participants come into the Bitcoin ecosystem and want to transact on the network, inevitably, transaction fees are going to go up. It comes down to the simple issue of supply and demand. With every block, there is only a limited amount of block space, so users have to compete to get their transaction into the next block.</p><p>This leads to users getting outbid and having their transaction action languish in the mempool or priced out of sending a transaction in the first place.</p><p>As someone who is lucky enough to live in the Western world, this isn’t a huge deal for me because I can wait for transaction fees to come back down. Many users in the global south don’t have that same luxury.</p><p>They are using Bitcoin as a monetary network to conduct day-to-day business, so Layer 1 fee spikes are a detriment to their daily survivals. This is where I am sympathetic to the argument that Bitcoin should be primarily used for transactions.</p><h2>Sympathy For Bitcoin Ordinal Enjoooyers</h2><p>But the rules are the rules, and Ordinals follow the parameters of Bitcoin. Since Ordinals launched, there has undoubtedly been an explosion of activity on the Bitcoin network. Before Ordinals, transactions could be sent for pennies, but after Ordinals,<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ordinals-upend-bitcoin-mining-pushing-224350412.html"> fees spiked to over $19.20 in May 2023.</a> This represents a 560% increase.</p><p>Obviously, this is a massive spike in fees, but on the flip side, it has shown the Bitcoin community that fees can replace the block subsidy in time.<a href="https://decrypt.co/139345/bitcoin-transaction-fees-surpass-block-rewards"> With block 788,695, for instance, there was 6.7 BTC in fees</a>, versus the standing block subsidy of 6.25 BTC.</p><p>Ultimately this is what we want to happen, but from what I can venture to guess, Bitcoin transaction maximalists didn’t want this to happen so early in the Bitcoin adoption cycle. Considering how early we are, I can see why they would be upset with the Ordinal enjoooyers.</p><p>Many of these maximalists think Ordinals enjoooyers are nothing but degenerate altcoiners, bringing their garbage to the Bitcoin network and clogging it up with monkey pics and d**k butts. Fair point, there is some of that going on. But there is nothing that can be done about it.</p><p>Bitcoin is for everyone, right? It is permissionless, and people can do whatever they want with Bitcoin as long as it doesn’t violate the rules. </p><p>But this tension in Bitcoin right now is creating two distinct camps in Bitcoin, which is sad to see because we should be united in the mission of getting the world on a Bitcoin standard.</p><h2>We Are The Emissaries For Bitcoin</h2><p>The division between the pro-Ordinal and anti-Ordinal camps mainly existed on Bitcoin Twitter, but it definitely came to a head at the Bitcoin 2023 conference in Miami. </p><p>If you watched the “Great Ordinals Debate,” you saw the tension from the get go. Both camps, represented by speakers on stage, came out swinging against each other, accusing one another of harming Bitcoin and Bitcoin adoption:</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AdYsQ2DWt5M" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>The debate came off as childish, and the arguing over BRC-20 tokens was little more than a sideshow. This schism was the front that was presented for the world to see, four guys arguing over something the general public doesn’t understand. Perception is everything right now, and if the goal is to onboard billions of people around the world, arguing over wizard pictures and obscure protocols isn’t the way to go.</p><p>In my view, this debate highlighted the struggle for the soul of Bitcoin right now. What does it mean to be a Bitcoiner? How should the network be used? Do Bitcoiners get to tell other Bitcoiners how to use the network? </p><p>These are questions that will probably continue to come up as long as Bitcoin exists and other use cases are created for Bitcoin.</p><p>I don’t like the infighting on Bitcoin Twitter or at the conference as it makes the Bitcoin industry look bad and like it isn’t ready for the big leagues. How can bitcoin become the world’s reserve currency when we don’t have our own house in order? Don’t s**t where you eat, guys. We are the emissaries for Bitcoin, and we should always be cautious of how Bitcoin is shown to the world.</p><p>The mission of Bitcoin is to offer a better alternative to the world and take away the power from the people who corrupt society with fiat currency. The powers that be won’t take Bitcoin seriously until we get serious numbers of people adopting it. If we want to change the world, the community needs to stay focused and presentable to a wider public. Ditch the wizard hats, and turn off the laser eyes. We are all on the same team and working toward the same goal. Let’s not forget what brought us to Bitcoin. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Robert Hall.

However, there is still space for banking in a Bitcoin world; though a variation from the system with which we are currently familiar. </p><p>Caitlin Long has tirelessly fought for sound banking practices especially as it relates to the dangers of leverage in bitcoin. Her work has brought positive attention to what banking in the Bitcoin space should look like. </p><p>Long’s impressive, 22-year Wall Street background combined with her candor and track record of championing sound money has made her a legend in many circles. In her home state of Wyoming, Long founded and serves as the CEO of Custodia Bank (formerly Avanti Financial Group) that works to bridge the gap between traditional banking and digital assets. Most recently, Long has been in the trenches fighting for Custodia to become a digital asset bank with a Federal Reserve account. She has been met with senseless <a href="https://custodiabank.com/press/custodia-stands-firm-in-response-to-the-fed/">opposition</a> from the Federal Reserve during this process, but Long has met these setbacks with stoicism, professionalism and integrity and continues to fight for Fed access for Custodia through a lengthy court battle. </p><p>It was a privilege to interview Long about her outlook on the Bitcoin space and the future of finance, and I know you will find her responses insightful.</p><p><strong>How did you first learn about Bitcoin and what <em>specifically</em> drew you to it?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I first learned about it in 2012 from alternative schools of economic thought. I was a member of an email group and started noticing people talking about it back then. For those who are not familiar with alternative schools of economic thought, Bitcoin has sparked a lot of interest within the various schools of thought. For example, those who follow Austrian School economics would generally see bitcoin as a digital version of gold due to its limited supply and decentralized nature. It’s an alternative store of value. They also would argue that, because Bitcoin is apolitical and deflationary in nature, it is a better alternative to fiat currencies that are dependent on inflationary monetary policy. </p><p>There are several other arguments to be made surrounding Bitcoin and alternative schools of economic thought, but we don’t have the time to get into those.<br></p><p><strong>As a leader in the Bitcoin banking sector, you have seen the highs and lows of policy in the U.S. Do you think Custodia will eventually be granted a Fed membership and account?</strong></p><p>I will have to let the lawsuit speak for itself regarding Custodia. However, I am optimistic regarding the policy issue generally. The people in power in Washington, D.C. today think they have the power to kill Bitcoin, which should give all of us a good laugh. Bitcoin has already died <a href="https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoin-obituaries/">474 </a>deaths and it still lives — it’s just code, and 8 billion people in the world already have the capability to run code on their smartphones. When organizations make decisions out of fear, they tend to get exactly what they feared. U.S. policymakers are going to get what they fear here as a result of pushing Bitcoin services into the proverbial shadows: they will face a stronger, more globally-distributed and therefore more resilient Bitcoin network, over which they have less visibility and control over U.S. dollar on-/off-ramps than they have today.</p><p><strong>Do you see bitcoin as an asset that will help to keep the U.S. dollar as the global reserve currency? Or as a means to an apolitical monetary system globally?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>There are definitely strategic and national security benefits to the United States maintaining its leadership in this technology. Yes, dollars can be issued on the Lightning Network, for example, and the United States should embrace this. The fact that stablecoins gained as much traction as they have is a testament to the world wanting the dollar to run on internet-speed payment rails.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In your opinion, why is it important to close the gender gap in Bitcoin interest and adoption?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>This is a tough question, and it is broader than just Bitcoin. It applies to the tech sector as a whole, as well as to the STEM fields generally. It’s no secret that I funded a scholarship for female engineers at the University of Wyoming in 2017 with appreciated bitcoin. In doing this, I am trying my best to encourage women to stay in the engineering field once they matriculate in an engineering major. </p><p>Aside from women speaking out, the best thing the Bitcoin space can do to attract more women, and indeed people of all backgrounds, is to keep adding blocks. Adoption will continue over time!</p><h2>Afterword</h2><p>There is a fair bit of irony in the fact that Long and the team at Custodia are doing things in the most compliant way possible and yet they are experiencing resistance from deep within the banking regulatory establishment. The concept of fully-reserved deposits just does not compute with banking regulators due to decades of indoctrination at the altar of debt and rehypothecation. Pioneers like Long deserve not only our respect, but also our support as they are the first ones into the breach. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Becca Bratcher.

However, my journey has also revealed the true costs of overlooking privacy in bitcoin transactions. </p><p>Through firsthand experiences and lessons learned, I've come to appreciate the paramount importance of protecting personal information and maximizing privacy levels. In this article, I will share my insights on the perils of sacrificing privacy in Bitcoin transactions and the steps I've taken to reclaim control over my financial freedom.</p><h2>The Price Of Transparent Transactions</h2><p>My initial enthusiasm for Bitcoin's privacy potential was met with a harsh reality: without the appropriate privacy measures, my transactions were anything but anonymous. I felt that this made the risk of theft loom large, as hackers could identify and target wallets holding substantial sums of bitcoin. Witnessing others<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/18/history-of-bitcoin-hacks-alternative-currency"> fall victim to these attacks</a> made me realize the grave financial losses that could result from a lack of privacy.</p><p>And beyond my individual concerns, I began to feel that neglecting privacy in bitcoin transactions held broader societal implications. When transactions lack anonymity, they can become tools for profiling and targeting individuals for various purposes. This erosion of privacy could in turn breed a loss of trust in Bitcoin, as users are likely seeking a more secure and permissionless alternative to the fiat monetary system. Bitcoin's true potential can only be realized when privacy is given the importance it deserves.</p><h2>Reclaiming Privacy And Financial Freedom</h2><p>Awakening to the costs of negligence, I made a conscious decision to reclaim control over my financial privacy. I took some proactive steps to protect my personal information and enhance my privacy levels. Here are the strategies I adopted:</p><ol><li>Embracing privacy-enhancing technologies: I employed a virtual private network (VPN) and Tor to encrypt my internet traffic and shield my identity, making it more challenging for prying eyes to track my online activity.</li><li>Harnessing <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-are-bitcoin-mixers">CoinJoin and Whirlpool</a>: CoinJoin technology, particularly through solutions like Whirlpool, allowed me to mix my bitcoin transactions with those of others, significantly bolstering my privacy and making it arduous for outsiders to trace my bitcoin activity.</li><li>Labeling and management: By meticulously managing my unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs), I decoupled my transaction history, embraced stealth addresses and exercised coin control, enhancing my overall privacy.</li><li>Breaking the address reuse habit: I committed myself to avoiding address reuse, opting for unique addresses for each bitcoin transaction that I conduct. This simple yet crucial practice minimized the ability of others to track and monitor my bitcoin transactions.</li><li>Peer-to-peer purchases: To minimize the exposure of my personal information and transaction details, I shifted towards peer-to-peer transactions instead of relying solely on exchanges.</li><li>Mindful information sharing: I became vigilant about the personal information I shared online, understanding that every piece of data could be exploited to identify and track my financial activities. Utilizing pseudonyms and aliases whenever possible shielded my identity.</li></ol><h2>Reclaiming Control</h2><p>Through my own experiences, I've witnessed the true cost of sacrificing privacy in bitcoin transactions. However, by taking proactive measures to protect my personal information and enhance my privacy levels, I've reclaimed control over my financial freedom. </p><p>Bitcoin's promise of decentralization, security and pseudonymity can only be fully realized when we prioritize and safeguard our privacy. Let us stand together, empowered by the knowledge that protecting our assets and privacy leads to a more secure and liberated future.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Prasad Prabhakaran.

Captains had been struggling with poor navigation since the onset of global trade. Though sailors could easily measure latitude by gauging the sun’s height, longitude was very hard to determine and inapt techniques veered vessels of course. Without visual bearings, humans were sailing blind on the open seas. The increased travel time led to scurvy, delays and ships smashing on the rocks — losing crew and cargo forever to the deep.<br><br>Fortunately, a genius Brit came up with the solution — the <em>chronometer</em>, a clock that could keep its beat on the volatile seas. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harrison">John Harrison</a> was this genius and his invention outperformed crude astronomical techniques that relied on clear skies, number tables and hours of calculation. There was no second best. <br><br>But his innovation wasn’t adopted!<br><br>According to “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude_(book)">Longitude</a>” by Dava Sobel, it took until 1828 for the Board of Longitude to be disbanded and the chronometer to reach mass adoption.<br><br>Why on Earth did it take so long?</p><h2>Going Beyond The S Curve</h2><blockquote><p>“...the diffusion of innovations is a social process, even more than a technical one.”<br></p><p>–Everett M.

Bitcoin is a decentralized clock in cyberspace enabling accurate economic calculation and financial navigation in the uncertain waters of life. Though its properties are superior in the eyes of its users, the rate of adoption is not as spectacular.&nbsp;</p><figure>

Certainly, ideas spread faster than ever before, but to consider this trend as the sole variable governing adoption rate is oversimplifying it. The longitude story shows us that, even when an innovation is a complete no-brainer, it may take longer than you think to catch on.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Everett Rogers was the social scientist who popularized the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations">observation of how innovations diffuse across the social medium by a normal distribution</a>. By aggregating adopters over time, the uptake looks like an S curve that hockey-sticks upward after a <em>critical mass</em> of users has been reached. This model gained popularity early this century as it explained the exponential growth of mobile phones and the internet.</p><p>But Rogers’ research encompasses more than just this memorable model. In his book, “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Diffusion-Innovations-5th-Everett-Rogers/dp/0743222091">Diffusion Of Innovations</a>,” he discerned five parameters that govern a technology’s adoption rate.</p><h2>The Five Perceived Attributes Of Bitcoin</h2><h3>One: Relative Advantage</h3><blockquote><p>“Diffusion is a particular type of communication in which the message content that is exchanged is concerned with a new idea.”</p><p>–Rogers, “<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=9U1K5LjUOwEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Diffusion Of Innovations</a>”</p></blockquote><p>Bitcoin’s perceived value is determined by two things: needs and price. <br><br>In order to have a need, one has to experience a problem. The issues with fiat money have long been recognized within the cypherpunk and sound money communities, and they were the first to adopt. But outside of these social cliques, the awareness of dollar debasement is low. A lack of financial education and fiat immersion leads people not to seek solutions. Without a <a href="https://bitcoin-graffiti.medium.com/emerald-city-syndrome-b554ee43945c">proper diagnosis</a>, nobody needs a cure. <br><br>Bitcoin’s price is slowing adoption and unit bias makes the coin look expensive. People don’t know it's subdividable. The price is also volatile, obfuscating its store-of-value function. You can contrast this with other adoption cases. For example, mobile phone users perceive value instantly — calling anyone, anytime, anywhere. But with Bitcoin, 80% drawdowns and “number go down” for years are not uncommon. It takes a high level of abstraction to see Bitcoin's value and high conviction not to be shaken out of the market.<br></p><h3>Two: Compatibility</h3><blockquote><p>“Potential adopters may not recognize that they have a need for an innovation until they become aware of the new idea or its consequences.”<br></p><p>–Rogers, “<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=9U1K5LjUOwEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Diffusion Of Innovations</a>”</p></blockquote><p>The first version of a new technology is rarely a perfect match for the entire market, catering only to a niche group of innovators. According to Rogers, an innovation needs to be <em>reinvented</em> to find product-market fit. <br><br>Bitcoin is currently compatible with the financially educated. But beyond this group, Bitcoin is not perceived to be in line with people’s value and belief systems. It’s still a niche product in the innovator stage.<br><br>For Bitcoin to reach more early adopters, it has to be reinvented for different global markets. Currently, two distinct paths are emerging: its narrative and medium-of-exchange (MoE) usage. Here are three examples:</p><ol><li>“Banking the unbanked”: Bitcoin can help people in developing countries to leapfrog the legacy banking system. <a href="https://www.starlink.com/">Starlink</a> and smartphones enable adoption where an MoE, system for remittances and a bank account in your pocket have high value. Leaders in countries like <a href="https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1526029996787216387?lang=en">El Salvador</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKydH0bLA0k&amp;t=45s">Mexico</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUU8ms63-e4&amp;t=1463s">Indonesia</a> use such narratives to explain Nakamoto’s invention.</li><li>“Cyber warfare”: In his book, “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Softwar-Projection-National-Strategic-Significance/dp/B0BW358F37">Softwar</a>,” <a href="https://twitter.com/JasonPLowery">Jason Lowery</a> uses military language to reinvent bitcoin as a geopolitical asset to be fought over by states in cyberspace, creating a new domain of war. Through the military lens, he recoins Bitcoin as “Bitpower,” creating a vision in which ASICs convert energy to raise a cryptographic wall, increasing the cost of attack on financial data. Lowery is a change agent, someone who translates Bitcoin to make it compatible with the U.S. army.</li><li>“Grid balancing”: This is the language for the energy sector clique. Proof-of-work mining can be used to make energy grids more resilient, balance supply and demand and turn a profit out of stranded energy sources.</li></ol><p>These narratives are designed to make Bitcoin more compatible with specific social groups that speak different languages. With increased understanding, these groups will drive the creation of new uses and applications.</p><figure>

    </figure><h3>Three: Complexity</h3><p>The chronometer was far ahead of its time and it took years before crafty entrepreneurs copied and manufactured the device. Similarly, Nakamoto had to introduce his invention to its first adopters on the <a href="https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/posts/">Bitcoin Talk forum</a>. Since then, entrepreneurs have had to join and build services on top of the protocol, including cold storage solutions, mnemonic seed phrases and exchanges. These upgrades improved the user experience, but compared to the mobile phone, Bitcoin’s still relatively complicated.<br><br>This also holds true at Bitcoin’s development level. New software developers experience a steep barrier of entry implementing Bitcoin in applications — the ecosystem is not as well developed as regular web development. And while it’s true that Bitcoin is not what it was back in 2008, and upgrades continue to make it more accessible — with groups like <a href="https://lightningdevkit.org/">Spiral</a> and <a href="https://github.com/breez/breez-sdk">Breeze</a> having recently launched software development kits to make integration easier, for instance — where is the Steve Jobs “boom” moment? </p><p>We are still waiting for the out-of-the-box killer app.&nbsp;</p><h3>Four: Trialability</h3><blockquote><p>“One must learn by doing the thing, for though you think you know it, you have no certainty until you try.</p><p>–Sophocles, “<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=FylP8XOYd8oC&amp;pg=PA191&amp;lpg=PA191&amp;dq=%E2%80%9COne+must+learn+by+doing+the+thing,+for+though+you+think+you+know+it,+you+have+no+certainty+until+you+try.%22+sophocles&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FjCEN6bW6Q&amp;sig=ACfU3U2Vw_aWYOdY6weUoGyotX2vP5jjOw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjsse6_36z_AhV8j4kEHdl5BKAQ6AF6BAgGEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9COne%20must%20learn%20by%20doing%20the%20thing%2C%20for%20though%20you%20think%20you%20know%20it%2C%20you%20have%20no%20certainty%20until%20you%20try.%22%20sophocles&amp;f=false">The Trachiniae</a>”</p></blockquote><p>The chronometer had a long trial period. By the time captains could update their peers on improved navigation, months of trial and travel had passed. The device was deemed good only if it was accurate along the full sailing journey. On top of that, a ship was underway for months, retarding the word of mouth.<br><br>The Bitcoin journey takes time, too. Since price is volatile, it is not uncommon to be "under water" for some time. This can have an effect on the advantages perceived by the user, but may also deter peers from adopting. The trial period may be as long as the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/bitcoin-halving-4843769">reward halving</a>, and true advocates are only minted after enough time in the market.<br><br>Though trialability of Bitcoin is easy — one can just buy a little — the overall net benefit is only great with a larger purchase, proving the point that the full trial period might be as long as one halving.</p><h3>Five: Observability</h3><p>Bitcoin is digital and thus poorly visible. It is not like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Model_T">Ford Model T</a> racing over the roads with its advantages on display. Most people only learn about Bitcoin in news reports when it has broken through its all-time highs, which can last only for a relatively-short duration.</p><p>Adoption speeds up with more visible applications. Perhaps in the not too distant future, Bitcoin miners may be integral parts of power plants and homes. People might send Bitcoin with their phones to friends on the street. Or they see the Lightning buttons on a <a href="http://iris.to/">Nostr client</a> and discover it’s possible to zap satoshis to their favorite influencers.<br><br>Also, increased wealth through bitcoin is hard to spot. Unless Bitcoiners start wearing Gucci and driving orange Lambos, rich HODLers are hard to observe. But wearing a giga-chad t-shirt might not be in vain and could potentially speed up the spread.</p><h2>Reward</h2><p>Harrison slaved away at his timekeeper alone for 20 years. His invention got blocked and retarded by bureaucracy, but he finally got his £20,000 bounty. Smart entrepreneurs were able to scale his ingenious design to mass production, bringing chronometers aboard ships where they saved time, cargo and lives. It took a long time, but the chronometer eventually floated to the top.<br><br>Today, the people of Earth are financially adrift. Like ships ignorant of longitude, they sail blindly through the treacherous waters of life, unable to financially calculate. We are barbarians living in the pre-science Stone Age of money. Future generations will look at us in dismay.<br><br>But this is about human psychology and how people embrace new ideas. In hindsight, world-changing technologies all appear self-evident. You’re right in the middle of a paradigm shift, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-ignites-a-scientific-revolution">the ignition of scientific revolution</a>, and it is hard to see where things are going.<br><br>Bitcoin won’t diffuse rapidly like Facebook, the internet or the iPhone. Much needs to be built, reinvented and translated before the masses get onboard. Like with electricity, base layers are hard to grok without the actual appliances.<br><br>We will get there.<br><br>But it will take longer than you think.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Bitcoin Graffiti.

Among the concerning trends I have observed is the growing number of patients who not only suffer from poor health but also find themselves trapped in a cycle of financial struggle and dependency.</p><p>In this article, I will explore the connection between fiat currency and the emergence of what can be called "fiat people" — individuals with high time preferences, unhealthy lifestyles, poverty and an increasing inability to care for themselves. Additionally, I will delve into how Bitcoin offers a potential solution to these challenges. </p><h2>The Health Impacts Of Fiat Currency</h2><p>“Fiat currency” refers to a form of money that is not backed by a physical commodity such as gold or silver but is instead declared as legal tender by a government. This system allows for the creation of money by central banks and is based on trust in the issuing authority. While fiat currency has its advantages, such as flexibility and ease of transactions, its inherent characteristics have unintended consequences that impact individual behavior and society as a whole, including manufactured inflation and monetary debasement.</p><p>Fiat currency, with its characteristics that can be easily manipulated and inflated, fosters a culture of instant gratification and short-term thinking. When the value of money becomes uncertain, individuals are incentivized to spend rather than save. Consequently, people develop a high time preference, prioritizing immediate consumption over long-term planning and investment.</p><p>This mindset leads to detrimental effects on personal health and well-being. People are more likely to engage in unhealthy behaviors such as excessive consumption of processed foods, lack of exercise and neglect of preventive healthcare measures. The consequences of these choices manifest in a rise in chronic illnesses, obesity rates, mental health issues and substance abuse problems. Individuals who cannot afford to regularly eat local whole foods often rely on processed foods made with seed oils and other unnatural ingredients, leading to a downward spiral of obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, renal failure, stroke and ultimately a complete dependence on the rest of society to care for them. </p><p>The prevalence of a high time preference perpetuated by fiat currency creates an environment where individuals fail to accumulate wealth and secure their financial futures. Continuous spending without proper savings leaves people vulnerable to unexpected expenses and economic downturns. Inflation erodes the purchasing power of their incomes, further exacerbating financial struggles. </p><p>Without the means to invest in education, acquire assets or start businesses, individuals are trapped in a cycle of poverty and limited economic mobility. Poverty, in turn, restricts access to quality healthcare, education and resources necessary for personal development, leading to a decline in overall well-being and increased dependence on external assistance.</p><h2>Bitcoin Is A Healthier Choice</h2><p>Recognizing the detrimental effects of fiat currency on individuals and society is crucial in paving the way towards positive change. Bitcoin offers a potential solution. Bitcoin operates outside the control of central banks, with a limited supply and a transparent nature that encourages responsible financial behavior and personal empowerment.</p><p>By returning to a form of hard money, individuals can regain control over their financial future. The fixed supply of bitcoin encourages savings and investment, fostering a culture of long-term thinking and responsible financial behavior. The decentralized nature of Bitcoin removes the dependence on centralized authorities and reduces the risk of inflationary practices, providing stability and transparency. </p><p>Embracing Bitcoin and decentralized financial systems can provide individuals with the means to break free from the cycle of high time preference, poor health and financial dependence. Bitcoin empowers individuals to make informed decisions about their finances, allocate resources efficiently and invest in their personal well-beings and futures. </p><p>The link between fiat currency and the emergence of fiat society cannot be overlooked. As an emergency medicine physician, witnessing the consequences firsthand, it is clear that a shift towards alternative monetary systems like Bitcoin, combined with financial education and personal responsibility, can pave the way for a healthier, more financially-stable society. </p><p>Bitcoin offers a path to personal empowerment and financial stability by breaking free from the grip of fiat currency. By regaining control over their lives and finances, individuals can improve their well-beings, escape the cycle of poverty and create a more prosperous future. However, it is important to approach this transition with thoughtful consideration, education and accessibility to ensure inclusivity. Through embracing  Bitcoin, we can strive toward a society where people are not mere products of fiat currency but rather creators of their own destiny.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Travis Headley.

When crypto exchanges, stablecoins and banks are collapsing left and right, it looks suspiciously like we are already in the “suddenly” portion. And it is suddenly that currencies of the past have moved from the pocketbooks to the history books. </p><p>Hyperinflation is a general increase in prices by 50% or more in a single month. <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Hyperinflation-A-World-History/Liping/p/book/9780367529208">Alternatively</a>, sometimes economists and journalists use a lower rate of monthly inflation sustained over a year (but that still amounts to 100%, 500% or 1,000%). The imprecision leads to some confusion in what does or does not constitute a hyperinflation.</p><p>Definitional quibbles aside, the main point is to illustrate the ultimate death of a fiat currency. Hyperinflation of whichever caliber is a situation where money holders rush for the exits, like depositors in a bank run rush for their funds. Literally <em>anything</em> is better to hold on to than the melting ice cube that is a hyperinflating currency. </p><p>A hyperinflating currency is often accompanied by collapsing economies, lawlessness and widespread poverty; and is usually preceded by extremely large money printing in service of covering equally vast government deficits. Double- or triple-digit increases in general prices cannot happen without a massive expansion of the money supply; and that generally doesn’t take place unless a country’s fiscal authority has difficulty financing itself and leans on the monetary authority to run the printing presses.</p><h2>BACKGROUND: What Hyperinflation is and how it happens</h2><p>In 1956, the economist <a href="https://www.bu.edu/econ/files/2011/01/Cagan1.pdf">Phillip Cagan</a> wanted to study extreme cases of monetary dysfunction. As we’ve learned over the past few years, whenever prices go berserk there is a big kerfuffle about who’s to blame — greedy capitalists, vague supply chain bottlenecks, unprecedented money printing by the Fed and fiscal deficits by the Treasury or that evil-looking dictator halfway around the world.</p><p>Cagan wanted to abstract away from any changes in “real” incomes and prices, and therefore placed his threshold at 50% price rises <em>in a single month</em>; any offsetting or competing changes in real factors, said Cagan, can then be safely disregarded. The threshold stuck, even though 50% a month makes for <em>astronomically </em>high rates of inflation (equal to about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation#:~:text=Economists%20usually%20follow%20Cagan's%20description,yearly%20rate%20of%2012974.63%25">13,000%</a> annually). The good news is that such an extreme collapse and mismanagement of fiat money is rare — so rare, in fact, that the Hanke-Krus World Hyperinflation Table, often considered the official list of all documented hyperinflation, contains “only” <a href="https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/iae/files/2017/04/Venezuela_Enters_the_Record_Book.pdf">57 entries</a>. (Updated for the last few years, its authors <a href="https://twitter.com/steve_hanke/status/1452017414250500096">now claim</a> 62.) </p><p>The bad news is that inflation rates well below that very demanding threshold have destroyed many more societies and wreaked just as much havoc in their economic lives. Inflation “bites” at much, much lower rates than that required for going into “hyper.”</p><p>Nobody does inflation like us moderns. Even the most disastrous monetary collapses in <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4981448_Modern_Hyper-_and_High_Inflations">centuries past</a> have been rather mild compared to the inflations and hyperinflations of the fiat age.</p><h2>What Hyperinflation Looks like</h2><p>“Hyperinflation very rarely occurs all of a sudden, without any early warning signs,” writes He Liping in his <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hyperinflation-World-History-China-Perspectives/dp/1138560081"><em>Hyperinflation: A World History</em></a>. Rather, they stem from earlier episodes of high inflation that escalate into the hyper variety. </p><p>But it’s not particularly predictive, since most episodes of <a href="https://www.elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/022/0040/002/article-A007-en.xml">high inflation</a> do <em>not </em>descend into hyperinflation. So what causes general periods of high inflation in the tens or twenties of percent that most Western countries experienced in the aftermath of Covid-19 pandemic in 2021-22 is different from what causes some of those episodes to devolve into hyperinflation.</p><p>The list of culprits for <em>high </em>inflation regimes include</p><ul><li>Extreme supply shocks that cause prices of key commodities to rise rapidly for a sustained time.</li><li>Expansionary monetary policy that a) involves central bank printing a lot of new money, and/or b) commercial banks lending freely, without restraint. </li><li>Fiscal authorities run fiscal deficits and ensure that aggregate demand runs hot (above trend or above the economy’s capacity).</li></ul><p>&nbsp;For high inflations to turn into <em>hyperinflations</em>, more extreme events must take place. Usually, the nation-state itself is at risk such as during or after wars, a dominant national industry collapses or the public loses trust in the government entirely. More extreme versions of the above are usually involve</p><ul><li>A fiscal authority running extremely large deficits in response to nation-wide or dependent industry shocks (pandemics, war, systemic bank failures). </li><li>The debt is monetized by the central bank and forced upon the population, often through the use of laws that mandate payments in the nation’s currency or bans the use of foreign currencies. </li><li>Complete institutional decay; efforts to stabilize the money supply or the fiscal deficits fail. </li></ul><p>In a hyperinflation event, holding cash or cash balances becomes the most irrational of economic actions, yet the one thing a government needs its citizens to do. </p><p>There is only so much printing you can — or would — do if there weren’t underlying problems or fiscal authorities breathing down your neck; there are only so much additional money the public wishes to hold, and when you start up the presses, the seigniorage profit you can extract becomes smaller and smaller when they ditch your currency for literally anything else. (“People are exchanging their dollars for <a href="https://youtu.be/cbI31x3FpS0?t=122"><em>dog money</em></a>.”)</p><p>Everybody wants to transact, often trying to get their wages paid several times a day and head to the store to purchase <em>anything</em>. Everybody wants to borrow or consume on credit — since one’s debt will disappear in real terms — yet nobody wants to lend: banks usually <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-banks-idUSKBN1HV1GO">curtail lending</a>, and credit runs dry. Prior debts are completely wiped out, as they were fixed in nominal terms. A hyperinflation event closely resembles a “clean slate,” a way for collapsed nation-states to restart, monetarily speaking. They reshuffle the net ownership of hard assets like property, machinery, precious metals or foreign currency. Nothing of financial consequence remains: all credit ties are inflated into nothingness. Financial ties no longer exist. It’s the ultimate weapon of mass financial destruction.</p><h2>History of hyperinflations</h2><p>Though the first cited instance is usually revolutionary France, the modern times contain four clusters of hyperinflations. First, the 1920s when the losers of WWI printed away their debts and wartime reparations. This is where we get the wheelbarrow imagery and which Adam Fergusson’s classic <em>When Money Dies</em> so expertly chronicles.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Second, after the end of World War II, we have another bout of war-related regime collapses leading rulers to print away their unsustainable obligations — Greece, Philippines, Hungary, China, and Taiwan. </p><p>Third, around the year 1990 when the Soviet sphere of influence imploded, the Russian ruble as well as several Central Asian and Eastern European countries saw their defunct currencies inflate away into nothingness. Soviet-connected Angola followed suit, and, in the years before Argentina, Brazil, Peru and Peru again. </p><p>Fourth, the more recent economic basket cases of <a href="https://www.aier.org/article/why-dollarization-doesnt-work-in-zimbabwe/">Zimbabwe</a>, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-tragedy-of-venezuela-1527177202">Venezuela</a> and <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/07/life-in-lebanon-under-hyperinflation/">Lebanon</a>. They all present stories of obscene mismanagement and state failure that while not exactly mirroring the previous clusters of hyperinflations, at least share their core features. </p><p>Egypt, Turkey and Sri Lanka are other nations whose currency debasements in 2022 were so stunningly bad as to merit a dishonorable mention. Though disastrous for these countries’ economies and tragic for the holders of their currencies — with head-spinning high inflation rates of 80% (<a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/07/21/lessons-from-turkey-on-the-evils-of-high-inflation">Turkey</a>), 50%-ish (<a href="about:blank">Sri Lanka</a>) or over 100% (<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/154bcd8c-a2ee-461f-83e4-dce1c8269171">Argentina</a>) — it is scant relief that their runaway monetary systems are long ways off to formally qualify as hyperinflations. You get terrible outcomes way before runaway inflation crosses the “hyper” threshold.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><p>High inflation episodes (double digits or more) are <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165188905001946">not stable</a>. The printing by authorities and monetary flight by users either accelerate or slow down; there is no such thing as a “stable” 20% inflation year after year. </p><p>What’s clear from the historical record is that <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/002205102760273805">hyperinflations</a> “are a modern phenomenon related to the need to print paper money to finance large fiscal deficits caused by wars, revolutions, the end of empires, and the establishment of new states.”</p><h3>They end in two ways: </h3><ol><li>Money becomes so worthless and dysfunctional that all its users have moved to another currency. Even viable governments that keep forcing their hyperinflating currencies onto the citizenry through legal tender and public receivability laws, receive only minor benefits from printing. Currency holders have left for harder monies or foreign cash; there is precious little seigniorage left to extract. Example: Zimbabwe 2007-2008, or Venezuela 2017-18. </li><li>Hyperinflation ends by fiscal and monetary reform of some sort. A new currency, often new rulers or constitution, as well as support from international organizations. In some cases, rulers seeing the writing on the wall purposefully hyperinflate their collapsing currency while preparing to jump to a new, stable one. Example: Brazil in the 1990s or Hungary in the 1940s. </li></ol><p>While currency collapses are a most painful reminder of monetary excesses, their ultimate causes are almost always <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2018/02/11/the-roots-of-hyperinflation">fiscal problems and political disarray</a> — a chronic weakness, a flailing dominant industry, a runaway fiscal spending regime. </p><p>The <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-money">three basic functions of money</a> — <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/medium-of-exchange">medium of exchange</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/unit-of-account">unit of account</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/store-of-value">store of value</a> — are impacted differently by instances of very high inflation or hyperinflation. Store of value is the <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Hyperinflation-A-World-History/Liping/p/book/9780367529208">first to go</a>, as evidenced by pictures of wheelbarrow inflation; the money becomes too unusable a vehicle through which to move value across time. The unit of account role seems remarkably resilient in that money users can <a href="https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/news/2008/10/15/day-life-hyperinflation">change price tags</a> and adjust mental models to the ever-shifting nominal prices. Accounts from Zimbabwe, Lebanon or South America indicate that money users can keep “thinking” in a currency unit (keep performing economic calculation) even though the rapid changes in daily value makes it harder to do this well.</p><p>Both hyperinflation and high inflation are severe headwinds on economic output and a wasteful use of human efforts, but money’s “<a href="https://bitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-monetary-metric/">metric role</a>” doesn't immediately go away. The medium of exchange role, which economists have long held to be the <a href="https://www.cato.org/cato-journal/spring/summer-2019/money-debt-trust-central-banking">foundational monetary role</a> from which the other functions stem, seems to be the most resilient. You can transact, hot potato-style, even with hyperinflating money. </p><p>Read More &gt;&gt; <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-money">What is Money?</a></p><h2>What happens: The few winners and many losers </h2><p>The natural reaction of Germans and Austrians and Hungarians, wrote Adam Fergusson in his classic account of the hyperinflations in the 1920s <a href="https://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/titles/adam-fergusson/when-money-dies/9781586489953/"><em>When Money Dies</em></a>, was “to assume not so much that their money was falling in value as that the goods which it bought were becoming more expensive in absolute terms.” When prices rose, “people demanded not a stable purchasing power for the marks they had, but more marks to buy what they needed.” </p><p>Hundred years later — a different time in different lands with a different money — the same doubts go through people’s minds. Inflation, of its hyper-variety or the ones we’re living through in the 2020s, muddies people’s ability to make economic decisions. It gets harder to know how much something “costs,” if a business is making a real profit or if a household is adding to or depleting its savings.</p><p><em>The Economist’s</em> account of the effects of Turkey’s inflation last year summarized the economy-wide consequences of inflation running amok. Under high (or hyper-)inflation, time horizons shrink and decision-making collapses to day-to-day cash management. Like all inflations there are arbitrary redistributions of wealth: </p><ol><li>The economic cost of high inflation is the unpredictability of the price system, the volatility of prices themselves. If you think bitcoin’s exchange rate to the USD is “volatile,” you haven’t seen basic prices in hyperinflating countries — wages, assets, grocery stores, rents. It undermines consumers’ ability to plan or make economic choices. Production gets delayed, investment decisions postponed and the economy squeezed since spending decisions are brought forward to the present. </li><li>In a similar vein, price signals don’t work as well anymore. It’s harder to see through the nominal prices to the real economic factors of supply and demand — like the car window into the economy suddenly becoming foggy. Haggling over exact prices makes transaction costs shoot up, which benefit nobody; partially substituting the failing money for foreign currency adds a second layer of (often black-market) exchange rates to juggle. </li><li>It’s unfair. Those best placed to play the inflation game, to shelter their wealth through property, hard assets or foreign currencies, can protect themselves. It causes a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/venezuelas-two-realities-people-with-dollars-and-those-without-11553511600">rift</a> between those who can access foreign currency or hard assets, and those who cannot. </li></ol><p>While most people’s economic lives are disrupted by (hyper)inflation and in aggregate everyone loses, some people benefit along the way. </p><ul><li>The most obvious losers are those holding cash or cash balances, since these are straight away worth less. </li><li>The most direct beneficiaries are debtors, whose debt gets inflated away; insofar as they can have their incomes keep pace with the fast rises in prices, the real <a href="https://www.aier.org/article/who-bears-the-burden-of-dollars-falling-purchasing-power/">financial burden</a> of the debt disappears. The flipside of that is the creditor, who loses purchasing power when their fixed-value asset deflates into nothingness.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Do governments benefit from high or hyperinflation?</h3><p>There is a lot of nuance to whether governments benefit from high inflation. The government itself usually benefits, since seigniorage accrues to the issuer of the currency. But general tax collection doesn’t happen instantly and so taxes on past incomes may be paid later in less valuable, inflated money. Besides, a poorer real economy usually makes for less economic resources that a government can tax. </p><p>Another way governments benefit is that their expenses are usually capped in nominal terms while tax receipts rise in proportion to prices and incomes. </p><p>As a large debtor, a government all else equal, has an easier time nominally servicing its debt — indeed, large government debts and financial obligations are major reasons to hyperinflate the currency in the first place. On the other hand, international creditors quickly catch on and refuse to lend to a hyperinflating government, or demand that they borrow in foreign currency and at additional interest rates. </p><p>Some institutional features matter too. To take two recent examples from the U.S.: Social Security indexation and the loss of income from the Fed. While the debt that gets inflated away involves a government’s pension obligation to retirees, there may be indexed compensation when prices rise. In December 2022, Social Security payments were adjusted upwards by <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/latestCOLA.html">8.7%</a> to account for the inflation captured in CPI over the last year. In more extreme cases of inflation or hyperinflation, such compensation might be delayed, or less stable governmental institutions may lack such features altogether, which would result in cuts in financial welfare for the elderly.</p><p>Similarly, when the Fed hiked rates aggressively during 2022, it exposed itself to accounting losses. For the foreseeable future it has therefore suspended its <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/broke-federal-reserve/">$100 billion in annual remittances</a> to the Treasury. While a drop in the 6 trillion <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/58946">federal outlay</a> bucket, it nevertheless shows how prior money printing can cause a loss of fiscal income in the future.</p><p>When a monetary authority has lost enough credibility (the money users give up a rapidly deteriorating money for precisely anything) it doesn’t much matter how one moves the small levers left under the monetary authority’s control. Hyperinflation, therefore, can be seen as a high inflation where the monetary authorities have lost control.&nbsp;</p><h2>Bottom line:</h2><p>Hyperinflations happen when the nation-state backers of a currency go out of business — as in the Balkan states and former Soviet Bloc countries in the early 1990s. They also happen from extreme mismanagement, from the Weimar Republic in the 1920s to the South American episodes in the 1980s and 1990s, or Venezuela and Zimbabwe more recently. </p><p>Remember that the German hyperinflation took place between 1922 and 1923, after wartime inflation (1914-1918) and postwar reparations debacle had gradually degraded the country’s finances and industrial capacity. Much like today’s monetary struggles, there was plenty of blame to go around but the point remains: it takes a long time for a thriving and monetary stable empire to devolve into the jaws of hyperinflationary chaos. </p><p>Every currency regime ends, gradually then suddenly. Perhaps things move faster today, but spotting a USD hyperinflation on the horizon (like <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1636822077775941633">Balaji did</a> in March 2023) might be too early yet. While we might not have reached the “suddenly” part yet, we can’t be sure that the “gradually” hasn’t already begun.</p><p>America in 2023 features many of the ingredients often involved in hyperinflations: domestic turmoil, runaway fiscal deficits, a central bank unable to imbue credibility or manage its price stabilization goals, grave doubts about the banks’ solvency. </p><p>The history of hyperinflation is vast but mostly confined to the modern age of fiat. If it’s any guide for the future, a descent into hyperinflation happens much more slowly and takes a lot longer than a few months.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk4NjYyNTY5MDA5OTQ4NDIz/what-is-hyperinflation-feature-image-no-text.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk4NjYyNTIwNDIzMDY1MzUx/what-is-hyperinflation-graph.png" height="542" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk4NjYyNTI4MjA3NjkzNTc1/hanke-krus-hyperinflation.png" height="312" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jack Dorsey’s #startsmall Pledges $5 Million Over 5 Years To Bitcoin Nonprofit Brink]]></title><description><![CDATA[The funding will provide a steady foundation for Brink to continue its mission of supporting Bitcoin development.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/startsmall-pledges-5-million-over-5-years-to-bitcoin-nonprofit-brink</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/startsmall-pledges-5-million-over-5-years-to-bitcoin-nonprofit-brink</guid><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Jack Dorsey]]></category><category><![CDATA[bitcoin development]]></category><category><![CDATA[brink]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Donations]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jun 2023 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MzI5NzY4OTU3NjUwNDM3/bitcoin-tree.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Bitcoin development nonprofit, Brink, has received a significant financial boost with a pledge of $5 million from Jack Dorsey's #startsmall organization.

But despite growing enthusiasm, sharp price volatility continues to worry and confuse many less-experienced investors.</p><p>A key way that I believe can help these investors beat their issues with bitcoin volatility is to begin following the principles of<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin-maximalism.asp"> Bitcoin Maximalists</a>. Below, I’ve highlighted my key takeaways from this philosophy that I think can help more investors find the right path.</p><h2>Bitcoin Maxis Invest In What They Understand</h2><p>Maximalists are a group of investors who believe that bitcoin is the only digital asset needed and that its demand will grow into the future. They believe that all other cryptocurrencies are not worth anyone’s energy or time. From my interpretation, this group includes significant names like Jack Dorsey, Adam Back, Robert Kiyosaki, Michael Saylor and others.</p><p>The maxi only invests in what they understand (bitcoin) now and into the future. According to most maximalists, investing in a proven digital asset is safer than doing so for altcoins, which put investors’ money at greater risk. With the recent rise of bitcoin’s value, many people seek ways to profit from this asset class without understanding how it works. While investors can make fiat returns with bitcoin in<a href="https://www.gobankingrates.com/investing/crypto/how-to-make-money-fast-with-cryptocurrency/"> several ways</a> (like trading, staking, lending, mining and gaming), maxis prefer to hold the asset.</p><p>Most maximalists are successful in their investment journeys because they understand their financial goals, inherent risks and the overall market. These contrarian investors don’t always don’t the crowd but instead<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/646701c97459d877fe161adc/"> look</a> for opportunities in places where others may not. Their advocacy for Bitcoin is rooted in a deep understanding of the cryptocurrency and the role it plays in preserving and growing wealth. The maxis’ endorsement of Bitcoin is a reminder for other investors to think outside the box. The asset provides unique benefits that can help diversify investors’ portfolios and increase their wealth.</p><h2>Focus On The Process</h2><p>The maxis’ investing model is simple: Buy and hold bitcoin in<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rufaskamau/2022/05/30/how-to-safely-self-custody-your-bitcoin/?sh=56ccbe0b6431"> self-custody wallets</a> and let it accumulate value over time. The maximalists achieve this through discipline, solid intellectual frameworks and sticking to an investment process. Following one’s process and staying disciplined minimizes the likelihood of any potential emotion affecting one’s investment decisions. Maxis’ most essential but difficult trait is to have discipline. They look at an investment with a long-term horizon, which requires patience but avoids hasty decisions.</p><p>A true Bitcoin Maximalist’s mind state is not about trading in and out of an investment. This is likely true for other types of investors. But for the maxi, following the process and having discipline means<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/02/technology/crypto-bitcoin-maximalists.html"> buying bitcoin</a> when prices dip. Instead of trading out after making a quick return, they hold bitcoin over a longer period and, as a result, believe they will accumulate massive gains.</p><p>The maxi believes holding bitcoin is the best way investors can increase their purchasing power due to the crypto’s growing user adoption and its<a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/bitcoin-s-limited-supply-increases-its-9855926/"> hard-capped supply</a> of 21 million BTC. </p><h2>The Long-Term Approach</h2><p>Many maximalists would say that their investment time frame goes for at least 10 to 20 years. This<a href="https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/buying-stocks/articles/if-you-invested-1000-in-bitcoin-10-years-ago-heres-how-much-youd-have-today/"> long-term approach</a> is the only way aspiring investors can make significant money with bitcoin. After all, Bitcoin is never about the short term. The maxis don’t change their minds simply because the entire market is acting in the opposite direction. It is with this conviction within themselves that they hold their investment, no matter what.</p><p>Bitcoin maximalist Michael Saylor<a href="https://cfi.co/finance/2022/08/michael-saylor-bitcoin-secrets/"> has described</a> his bitcoin ownership as the “family farm” — something an investor should never sell. Last year, the crypto market suffered a significant meltdown, triggered by geopolitical and macroeconomic turmoil. Saylor expressed his disappointment for those who rushed to sell their bitcoin. Maxis’ long-term approach to bitcoin investing reminds me of the saying that people who achieve great things are the ones who set their minds to it.</p><p>So long as an investor can purchase bitcoin at reasonable prices, they can create wealth over the long term. The sooner you invest in bitcoin, the more time you have to earn returns. And the more time you have, the more returns are earned by your returns. The concept is popularly known as the “power of compounding,” which<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/04/compounding-and-saving-in-bitcoin-the-power-of-a-dollar-cost-averaging-strategy/"> works</a> perfectly in the case of Bitcoin.

Apple claims that Damus violates their guidelines by allowing users to send "tips" (zaps) associated with receiving content from digital content creators through a mechanism other than in-app purchase. This violation of Guideline 3.1.1 - Business - Payments - In-App Purchase has prompted Apple to take action, according to the message sent to Damus creator William Casarin.</p><p>The news comes at a critical time for Damus and its creator, who was set to give a talk at the Oslo Freedom Forum on how decentralized social networks, integrated with lightning technology, can bring financial freedom to the masses. The impending removal from the App Store raises concerns about the freedom to transact peer-to-peer on the platform and has broader implications for apps that rely on Lightning integration and value-for-value models on the app store.</p><p>In an official communication from Apple's App Review, Damus received notice that an update compliant with the App Store Review Guidelines must be submitted within 14 days to ensure the app's availability. Failure to comply within the given timeframe will result in the app being removed from sale. Additionally, if Damus is found to be out of compliance and rejected even after the 14-day period, it will remain unavailable until a compliant update is submitted, approved, and released.</p><p>The removal of Damus from the App Store would not only impact its current users but also affect external and internal testing through the TestFlight version. All public TestFlight links will cease to function if the app is taken down.</p><p>This development raises questions about the future of apps with Lightning integration and the potential limitations on peer-to-peer transactions on Apple's platform. It remains to be seen how Damus and its creator will respond to this setback and whether they can find a solution that aligns with Apple's guidelines while maintaining the core principles of decentralization and financial freedom. <br><br>One interesting note is that Twitter allows for “tips” through the Lightning Network if enabled on a profile, which <a href="https://twitter.com/zubymusic">many</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/cwt_news">large</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/shannenpill">accounts</a> do have. It is unclear how this function differs from the zap feature within Damus, as both utilize Lightning and do not rely on in-app purchases.</p><p>In the face of uncertainty, Casarin <a href="https://damus.io/note14vfvfnt8ynlp4qj2fcdt5t28judjypdnth83swmdhlythryw2seq2nuuh6">expressed his concerns</a>, stating, "If people can't transact freely p2p on their platform, this has huge implications for the entire ecosystem of apps with lightning integration and v4v." The statement reflects the gravity of the situation and the potential ramifications for the broader ecosystem of decentralized social networking apps.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>In another note posted to Nostr, Casarin said that “Its been an honour zapping with y’all,” implying that the most likely next step is the removal of zaps in order to comply with the App Store regulations. Responses to the note expressed support and appreciation for the creation of the app, and hope that zaps will at some point return.</p><p>U.S. Congressman Warren Davidson <a href="https://twitter.com/WarrenDavidson/status/1668643286003638277?s=20">released a statement</a> on Twitter that read in part, “Permission-less peer-to-peer payments are essential to defending freedom.” In addition, Twitter Founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1668648607661056000?s=20">tweeted at Apple CEO Tim Cook</a> saying the function “has the capacity to bring people around the world into the economy without the traditional gatekeepers.

In fact, many seed phrases are stored on pieces of paper, carved and/or stamped into pieces of metal or are typewritten… with vintage typewriters. </p><p>Even <a href="https://store.bitcoinmagazine.com/collections/magazines">Bitcoin Magazine</a>, while having a massive online presence, sells out of their physical publications.</p><p>The analog aspect of humanity isn’t a trend — analog defines us. </p><p>For many, something deeper occurs when they place a record onto a player. The act of moving a physical arm, which houses a delicate needle onto pressed vinyl, and then hearing the scratches, pops and subtle noises of the system at work is not listening, it’s feeling.</p><p>Similarly, the physical task of manually winding a watch involves touch. The act of twisting the crown provides feedback to not only the fingers, but the ears as well. Some even might argue, the heart is engaged. In regard to wearing an automatic watch, some owners can “feel” the rotor within the micro-mechanical system as it spins on their wrist.</p><h2>Improbable Correlations, Experiments And Errors</h2><p>The earliest mechanical (automatic) watch dates back to the early 1500s. <a href="https://art.thewalters.org/detail/27471/spherical-table-watch-melanchthons-watch/#item-moda">A spherical timepiece</a> that, when manually wound, ran for upwards of 16 hours. </p><p>The piece, which was reported to have been created by <a href="https://www.artsandcollections.com/article/horology-a-brief-history/">horologist</a> <a href="http://www.historyofwatch.com/clock-inventors/peter-henlein/">Peter Henlein</a> (a German clockmaker) for Philipp Melanchthon (the patron), was accurate to the nearest half hour. </p><p>Within 100 years, <a href="https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_856876">Galileo Galilei</a> was tinkering with the concept of “pendulum clocks”; however, while Galileo’s sketches illustrated a profound interest in the potential of creating a pendulum clock, he <a href="https://museum.seiko.co.jp/en/knowledge/MechanicalTimepieces03/#:~:text=Galileo%20conceived%20of%20an%20isochronous,inventing%20the%20first%20pendulum%20clock.">did not construct one before his death</a>. </p><p>The development of the first pendulum clock is credited to horologist <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Huygens/">Christiaan Huygens</a> in the mid-1600s. Huygens’ earlier works purported accuracy of approximately <a href="https://www2.vobs.at/ball-online/topics/TIME/history_of_time_mechanical_clock.htm">one minute per day</a>, but iterations pushed the clock-maker to error’s less than 10 seconds per day. Fast forward another 75 years or so, and clockmakers had refined the craft to an accuracy of plus or minus 1 second per day into the 1700s. </p><p>A fun experiment for readers if you want to understand Huygens’ physics: Create your own crude pendulum by tethering a weight to a string. Once the weight is hanging freely, grab the string in one hand and then use the other hand to pull the weight to one side, then let go.</p><p>You’ll notice the weight swing from one side to another… not very fascinating, right? But then, grab the weight and pull it from a higher distance and let go. Repeat from a lower distance.</p><p>What you’ll find is exactly what Huygens <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.170777">theorized and then proved</a>; that the stored potential energy of the weights plays no role in how fast the pendulum swings — the time the pendulum takes to pass through the center is constant; no matter how far you drop the pendulum from. </p><p>The <em>only</em> way to adjust the speed of the pendulum is to either increase or decrease the actual length of the string; a longer string length equates to a slower pendulum rate (pulse); and a shorter length, thus results in a faster pulse or tick as the weight swings back and forth. </p><p>This, for all intents and purposes, is how mechanical watches are adjusted, except without a string, a tiny piece of metal (a spring) is wound. If a watch is running slow or fast, adjustments are made within the system. Not much has changed in the past 150 years or so. It's beautiful because it’s simple.</p><p>I correlate the accuracy errors of mechanical timepieces to my Bitcoin discovery phase. Initially, I believed that every 10 minutes, a new Bitcoin block was created; however, as I surrounded myself with more experienced community members, technical personnel and cypherpunks, I learned that block times vary, or “oscillate,” between a few seconds in deviation to a few days in some cases. The protocol adjusts the length of the pendulum string automatically based on the needs of the network.</p><p>The mechanical aspects of time deviation that Satoshi Nakamoto coded into Bitcoin, unlike watchmaking, are features, not bugs.</p><h2>Tick Tock, Next Clock</h2><p><a href="https://thewatchcollectorsclub.com/blog/we-explore-which-watches-are-counted-as-high-horology/">High horology</a>, also known as the more precise, meticulous and highly-time-consuming task of creating bespoke and, in many instances, the most exceptionally accurate mechanical timepieces known to man, often turn a blind eye toward quartz, digital, solar or hybrid movements. </p><p>While many may not realize this, a typical quartz Timex or Casio is <a href="https://teddybaldassarre.com/blogs/watches/watch-movements">more accurate than many high-end mechanical watches</a>. Additionally, some watch connoisseurs do not regard many of the “expensive” brands as constituting “high horology” simply because of their brand names. The devil is in the details.</p><p>Collectors might, however, consider a bespoke offering from a watchmaker that they may have never heard of, assuming that the horologist created something remarkable, such as the quad-layer, guillochéd <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-05-22/la-watchmaker-joshua-shapiro-resurgence">Resurgence</a> timepiece that Joshua Shapiro has prototyped in Southern California.</p><p>The irony is that many watch collectors typically also have a $40 to $100 Casio G-Shock (or equivalent) wristwatch in their collections. There are various reasons why, but in truth, different tasks require different tools.</p><p>Regarding Bitcoin, the tool of BTC awaits tasks, layers and adoption. Bitcoin is both high horology and a $40 Casio. The application adapts based on the user and the network; but most significantly, upon the developers who dedicate their lives to bettering the network. </p><h2>Jewels </h2><p>When considering the number of gears, wheels, pinions, springs, etc., in a mechanical watch movement, a lot of friction is generated between the micro-metallic components, not unlike the friction caused by some within the BTC community. </p><p>As such, <a href="https://teddybaldassarre.com/blogs/watches/watch-jewels">jewels</a> in a mechanical watch can be more commonly referred to as “bearings.” As such, a jewel does not represent “jewelry,” but rather a precise gem-bearing implemented to reduce friction. </p><p>If you own a mechanical, automatic or any variation of a modern self-winding watch, odds are, there is a “jewel” number on the back of the timepiece. </p><p>Quartz timepieces may not have a single jewel in their mechanism, while others may have a handful. </p><p>Implementing a battery, generators and capacitors into quartz movements has reduced or removed the need for traditional “jeweling.” </p><p>Most mechanical watches <a href="https://www.prestigetime.com/blog/what-are-the-jewels-in-a-watch-for.html#:~:text=Around%2017%20stones%20are%20used,positional%20errors%20as%20mentioned%20above">have 17 jewels</a>, while more complex timepieces implement more.</p><p>Initially, diamonds, rubies and sapphires were implemented as bearings in these complex timepieces. Today, even the most well-known watchmakers utilize <a href="https://www.livwatches.com/blogs/everything-about-watches/watch-jewels-101#:~:text=Eventually%2C%20the%20economics%20and%20characteristic,properties%20of%20their%20natural%20counterparts">synthetic sapphires or rubies</a>.</p><p>In Bitcoin, horology matters. </p><p>Whether one has caught the bug of watch collecting or has zero knowledge of that space is irrelevant to the field of horology; the space drives forward without them. The mechanics of automatic watches haven’t changed in hundreds of years and, in truth, perhaps this is why the field is so endearing.</p><p>Bitcoin is on the same trajectory. </p><p>While many believe Bitcoin is too complex to understand, these same critics use other technologies daily and, ironically, could never articulate how the technology they use every day actually functions. </p><p>Some members of the same community view Bitcoin as archaic technology; everything revolves around perspective. </p><p>If you asked most of the population how a mechanical watch “tells time,” could they tell you? Even many watch collectors could not identify all of the parts in a movement, and that’s okay. </p><p>Adoption is adoption. </p><p>With or without them, the Bitcoin protocol ticks on in a similar fashion. </p><p>My mechanical watch may sit idly by; however, once I pick it up and put it on my wrist, the second hand begins to sweep, and the inner workings spring back to life.</p><p>Bitcoin in cold storage is akin to an automatic watch waiting to be worn. </p><p>Within the Bitcoin community, there are friction points, not within the software per se, but within the community itself. </p><p>Jewels in the Bitcoin community might exemplify friction-reducing individuals, programmers, node operators and the like, who are often downplayed at conferences, online and in the real world. </p><p>Most recently, some programmers have <a href="https://decrypt.co/139259/bitcoin-ddos-ordinals-inscriptions-attack?amp=1">attempted to introduce friction</a> into the mechanics of the Bitcoin protocol. </p><p>The friction reduction aspects (jewels) of the Bitcoin community are under-appreciated but play a critical role in the protocol. </p><p>I encourage the cypherpunk community to be on guard for continued attacks in an attempt to create friction within the protocol and to be prepared with additional jewels in hand, ready for deployment. </p><p>In previous <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/authors/riste-simnjanovski">articles</a> and a <a href="https://a.co/d/1zWdzxJ">book</a>, I hinted at the quiet Bitcoin community (QBCs) and its significance; perhaps I should refer to them as “jewels”<em> </em>in our protocol moving forward.</p><p>Stay strong and continue to do good work — you are appreciated. </p><p><em>Author’s note: Special thanks to Bitcoin Magazine, Peter Chawaga and company; to Third Man Records, especially Jack White and his crew; to Drs.

Generationally speaking, one could make the argument that it is the job of the younger generation to essentially tell us older folks to go fly a kite (perhaps in more raw terms, and metaphorically of course) when it comes to our values, our norms, our advice, etc. Music provides an apt cultural landscape on which to view this tension.</p><h2>The Same Old Song</h2><p>In every generation, emerging and evolving musical forms have been decried by the older, traditional set as being bad music, noise, even not music at all. In the late 1950s, Walter Cronkite <a href="https://www.exberliner.com/film/miles-davis-birth-of-the-cool/">referred to jazz as “musical noise,”</a> and his words were not offered as praise. Rockabilly of the 1950s was surely detested by many in the traditional country community. The music of the Summer Of Love was rejected by many parents who likely embraced jazz and bebop. Punk rockers were undoubtedly met with blank stares and utter contempt by their hippie parents, and rap continues to be the object of musical scorn the world over. The point is clear: Tradition hates innovation, mostly because tradition doesn’t understand innovation and feels threatened by this new iteration. And yet, the truth remains; it’s all just music.</p><p>Here's where things get a bit complicated.</p><p>It’s one thing to not understand, dislike, even personally reject something new. It’s another thing entirely to discredit the new, to actively fight against the new, to try and destroy the new. And within that effort to destroy and to bury the new form of expression, those seeking to kill off the new thing will, in their rather tired and sad desperation, create false narratives and stories to rationalize their adherence to traditional ways. Unfortunately, these narratives can become so powerful, that they lead to the development of institutions and movements guided entirely by falsehood, led by self-serving and power-hungry zealots, armed with all of the cultural weaponry that tradition has at its disposal; shameless and conscienceless, these forces will often go to extreme lengths to kill the thing that they have decided, in their self-concerned ignorance, is evil.</p><p>As much as I hope that, somewhere far in the future, such destructive and reductive forces can be disempowered by truth-informed mechanisms like the Bitcoin protocol, I am not holding my breath. But in the present, the power of <em>verification </em>— that very thing that makes Bitcoin such a revolutionary moment — can be leveraged by the Bitcoin community as a way to bridge the generational gap, to push back against the narratives that baby boomers and others embrace in their rejection of Bitcoin, and to move the protocol adoption curve forward.</p><h2>My Bitcoin Pitch To Fellow Boomers</h2><p>Here’s my point:</p><p>My generation (I’m a youthful 61) has many qualms with Bitcoin. Some of these concerns are valid (old people hate volatility), while others are informed by entirely false narratives and prejudices. And just like with the musical examples above, so many of these false narratives are incredibly difficult to disarm; for embedded within these rejections of something new there exists a desperate clinging to something understandable, something empowering, something unifying in its self-righteous disgust and self-concentered defensiveness. </p><p>Now granted, I’m a boomer, so I have a little more natural validity when I speak with my peers about Bitcoin. I’m not the AirPods-wearing, yoga-mat-toting, entirely-self-absorbed and personal-development-obsessed millennial who my generation loathes so very much (wry smile). But even such affinity does not get me far with Bitcoin. Rejection narratives come hot and they come quickly: environmental degradation, dark web currency, gambling casinos that make TikTok’ers rich, etc. </p><p>My strategy in pushing back against these arguments goes back to music: </p><blockquote><p>“Look,” I say “You may be right. Bitcoin may be energy intensive and not helpful to the environment. Bitcoin may be used by scammers and defrauders as part of their schemes to get rich. Bitcoin may be the currency, or one of the currencies, of a generation of social-media heads, people who you hold in such contempt. This may all be true. But I would argue three things: One, that you are embracing arguments that you have heard but have not investigated yourself; Two, that you are basing your hatred and rejection of Bitcoin not on the merits of Bitcoin, but on the way Bitcoin shows up in the world (just like our parents rejected our music, because it came with long hair and blue jean jackets); And three, that you are rejecting Bitcoin because you don’t understand it, which is so very much what all older generations do about shit they don’t get.”</p></blockquote><p>And then I say this:</p><blockquote><p>“There’s one thing about Bitcoin that makes it different from anything else in the world, and that is the dynamic of verification. Ignore all of the other stuff just for a second, if you can. I am entirely willing to stipulate that, after you do your own research and after you challenge your own prejudices toward those yucky millennials (another wry smile) that you may still reject Bitcoin, but hear me out on this one thing, this one really cool and rather revolutionary element of Bitcoin: Unlike every other human interaction in the world, Bitcoin does not ask us to put our blind trust in anyone else. No one owns it or controls it, so we’re not being asked to trust the words and deeds of bankers or government officials or scammers or anyone; no one can hack it (take some time to learn about why), so it is, even in its volatility as an investment, the most secure network of all time; and no can destroy it, because it is software that runs on millions of computers, all of which are verifying each and every transaction that takes place.”</p></blockquote><p>And then this:</p><blockquote><p>“Look, I’m not saying you should invest in bitcoin. And lord knows that in a world replete with greedy people and liars, bitcoin is just as apt to be used by these people as are dollars or gold or real estate or whatever gets them rich. And truth be known, millennials make me roll my eyes as well. But you know what, that’s my generational B.S. It’s my own crap. Just like my parents shook their heads at my Grateful Deadness and my punk rockness, I shake my head toward millennials. But that rigidity and silliness shouldn’t inform my views about an emerging monetary technology and protocol. If it does, then I am guilty of the very thing that we blamed our parents for being guilty of 40 years ago. I don’t want to be part of yet another anti-intellectual generation that rejects stuff it doesn’t understand, or that embraces false narratives about things because those are the narratives we are exposed to the most.”</p></blockquote><p>And then my closing:</p><blockquote><p>“All I’m asking is that you take a moment and consider what a world in which verification of truth, rather than trusting someone else’s words, might look like. For example, bitcoin and the Bitcoin network could have totally ended all of the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/trump-election-denials-and-the-need-for-bitcoin-verification">stuff about stolen elections</a>, because within this realm of verification there exists the ability to validate and verify each and every transaction (every vote) beyond any doubt. Also, with the Bitcoin network and protocol, you can say goodbye to things like identity theft and credit card scams and being double charged for stuff you didn’t buy; because with Bitcoin every, every, <em>every</em> transaction is verified on an entirely secure network by tens of thousands of computers running unhackable software. And the thing is, there are so many examples of how verification could make the world in which we live so much better, because when we can verify stuff then we end up trusting the whole process. So all I’m asking is to do a little investigation about this thing before you reject it; you may find, despite yourself, that as you <em>get </em>it more, your appreciation for it changes.”</p></blockquote><p>We live in a world in which trust is an ever-diminishing construct. As I noted in my <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/as-trust-erodes-bitcoin-is-verifiable">first</a> <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/trump-election-denials-and-the-need-for-bitcoin-verification">two</a> pieces in this series, as trust continues to erode, we, as a species, are in increasing trouble and distress. I totally grok why my generation doesn't trust Bitcoin. But I also get that our mistrust is informed by false narratives, by petty prejudices, and by a tenacious adherence to things we understand and know. The thing about Bitcoin that makes it so novel, and so elegant, is that the protocol, by way of example, cuts through all of the falsehood. This I feel is the most powerful thing about Bitcoin, and this I feel is a route toward bringing more and more people into the fold.</p><p>Virtually everyone on the planet, boomers included, is concerned about the direction we are heading as a species. And at the heart of this fear is the fact that we can’t trust anything anymore. Bitcoin changes this through its inviolable verification mechanism. It begins with money, property, assets. Who knows where it ends. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Dan Weintraub.

Therefore, using PGP is good for preserving democracy. If privacy is outlawed, only outlaws will have privacy… PGP empowers people to take their privacy into their own hands. There has been a growing social need for it. That's why I wrote it.”&nbsp;</p><p><em>–</em>Phil Zimmerman, “<a href="https://www.philzimmermann.com/EN/essays/WhyIWrotePGP.html">Why I Wrote PGP</a>”</p></blockquote><p>The <a href="https://youtu.be/ITiUyFuk1vA">case</a> of Roman Sterlingov, who stands accused of running the custodial Bitcoin mixer, "Bitcoin Fog," is indicative of the many situations in which individuals are targeted by law enforcement for safeguarding their financial privacy. </p><p>As outlined in “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITiUyFuk1vA">What Bitcoin Did</a>,” the U.S. Department of Justice relied on Chainalysis' Reactor software to trace the purchase of the Bitcoin Fog domain back to an address linked to Sterlingov’s Mt. Gox account, establishing him as its operator. Reactor was designed to tie cryptocurrency addresses with real-world identities. Despite the various irregularities present in this <a href="https://twitter.com/JackTracante/status/1661114322469134362?s=20">ongoing case</a>, one could draw the conclusion that it sends a clear message of “thou shalt not have financial privacy.”</p><h2>Introducing Ark</h2><p>Given this growing hostility toward financial privacy for Bitcoin transactions, there is a pressing need for the development of superior tools. At the recently concluded Bitcoin 2023 conference, a potentially game-changing tool, called the <a href="https://www.arkpill.me/">Ark Protocol</a>, was introduced. </p><p>Announced during one of the <a href="https://youtu.be/mn9Xhp5QLjo?t=10285">keynote sessions </a>on the open-source stage by developer <a href="https://twitter.com/brqgoo">Burak,</a> Ark is a Layer 2 scaling solution that enables cheap, anonymous and off-chain Bitcoin transactions. The protocol also has a minimal on-chain footprint, which further protects user privacy while keeping transaction costs low. In what can be described as an “accidental invention” that occurred when Burak was trying to develop a Lightning wallet, Ark is a distinct protocol that could potentially scale non-custodial bitcoin use. </p><p>Burak named the protocol "Ark" in reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah%27s_Ark">Noah's Ark</a>, which acts as a lifeboat that provides refuge from predatory blockchain surveillance firms and custodians.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>During his presentation, Burak highlighted one of the most concerning trends with the Lightning Network today, which is that there are currently more custodial users of Lightning than there are non-custodial ones. This is mainly due to the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/sourcing-bitcoin-lightning-liquidity">liquidity constraints</a> on Lightning that require non-custodial users to first receive liquidity from someone else’s node before they can receive funds. Custodial wallets like Wallet Of Satoshi abstract this problem away from the user but at the expense of the user not being 100% in control of their funds, as well as their financial privacy. </p><h2>An Alternative Layer 2 Protocol</h2><p>I interviewed Burak to gain a deeper understanding of Ark and the inspiration behind its development. When I quizzed him on what led him to develop an alternative Layer 2 protocol, he said:</p><p>“I have always been a critic of Lightning mainly because of inbound liquidity issues, async receiving as well as its on-chain footprint. Inbound liquidity always felt like a bug to me, which made the user experience anything but pleasant. In addition to that, it would take more than a century to onboard the entire global population in a non-custodial fashion onto the Lightning Network, assuming each person has four channels that each consume a few hundred vbytes.” </p><p>As he set out to address these and other issues, his Lightning wallet idea eventually morphed into Ark.</p><p>“Ark can be best defined as trustless e-cash or a liquidity network similar to the Lightning Network but with a UTXO set that lives entirely off-chain and it’s neither a statechain nor a rollup,” Burak said. “These UTXOs are called ‘virtual UTXOs’ or ‘vTXOs,’ which have a ‘lifespan’ of four weeks. The core of Ark's anonymous off-chain payments is driven by the vTXOs.”</p><p>Throughout the conversation, Burak continued to emphasize his obsession with a frictionless experience for the end user, his view being that sending sats should be as easy as pushing a button. This is one of the reasons why Ark users do not need to have channels or liquidity, as this is delegated to a network of untrusted intermediaries known as Ark service providers (ASPs). These are always-on servers that provide liquidity to the network, similarly to how <a href="https://medium.com/breez-technology/introducing-lightning-service-providers-fe9fb1665d5f">Lightning service providers</a> operate, but with an added benefit: ASPs are unable to link senders with receivers, which adds another layer of privacy for users. </p><p>This is made possible by the fact that every payment on Ark takes place within a <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/CoinJoin">CoinJoin</a> round which obfuscates the connection between sender and receiver. The best part about this is that the CoinJoin happens entirely off-chain while settling payments every five seconds, which not only drastically reduces on-chain footprints but also fortifies the users’ privacy. The anonymity set is every party involved in a transaction and, theoretically, this creates a greater degree of privacy than what’s possible on the Lightning Network. Furthermore, Ark mimics on-chain user experiences in that users have a dedicated address for sending and receiving payments, but the difference is that it’s a reusable address that doesn’t compromise the user’s privacy, made possible in a way that’s similar to how <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-silent-payments-secret-keys">silent payments</a> work. </p><h2>Trade-Offs</h2><p>However, like any other system, Ark does have its own trade-offs. Although it may not offer instant settlements as rapidly as Lightning does, it provides immediate accessibility to funds without having to wait for confirmations in what Burak described as “immediate availability with delayed finality.” </p><p>For vendors, Lightning is still the better option when it comes to receiving payments. Additionally, liquidity providers are required, but based on the assumption that individuals will be motivated to offer liquidity to earn yield in bitcoin, Burak also thinks this challenge can be easily overcome in the long term. This novel proposition addresses certain shortcomings in Lightning, yet also comes with its own set of challenges.</p><h2>The Road Ahead</h2><p>In summary, the Ark protocol is a unique, second-layer scaling solution with unilateral exit capability that enables seamless transactions without imposing any liquidity constraints or interactivity, nor necessitating a direct connection between sender and receiver. Therefore, recipients can easily receive payments without the hassle of any onboarding setup, maintaining a continuous server presence or compromising their anonymity to third parties. Designed to be a scalable, non-custodial solution, Ark allows users complete control over their funds and gives everyone the option to self custody their money.</p><p>Ark is interoperable with Lightning, but also serves as a complement to it. However, due to the complicated process of self-custodial Lightning and varying levels of privacy for senders and receivers, along with the imminent danger posed by blockchain surveillance firms, scaling solutions that prioritize privacy, like Ark, have become essential. The various attempts to attack Bitcoin through malicious prosecution, like in the case of Sterlingov, and predatory legislation such as the EU's <a href="https://decrypt.co/138713/what-is-mica-eu-crypto-regulation-explained">MiCA</a>, demonstrate the need for scalable, efficient, privacy-preserving tools in order to prevent future issues. </p><p>It’s against this background that I think Ark is an interesting concept worth keeping an eye on as development of the protocol unfolds. Of course, without code to review at the moment or a battle-tested, working prototype, it’s still a long road ahead. Despite the unforeseen challenges ahead, Burak is optimistic about Ark’s potential and is convinced that it’s a breakthrough that strikes the balance between private Bitcoin transactions and scalability, in a user-friendly manner. A sentiment that I also share, given the vital need for non-custodial, privacy-preserving tools. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Kudzai Kutukwa.

Does anyone remember these? FitFlops sold for some $100 and promised to work your legs into shape just by walking. Seeing them made me recall the time I spent traveling across Asia from around 2008 onward. </p><p>In those years and into the early 2010s, I was busy managing a company based in Hong Kong while accompanying my then boyfriend/fiancé around Asia. He worked on various finance projects with governments in the region, flashing his MBA, two master’s degrees and finance background while I occupied my days, and some nights, with corporate matters and adding to my investment portfolio. In those days, that meant investing in various equities, some Asian venture capital funds and an occasional seed funding opportunity.</p><p>Apart from that, I also did some modeling for advertisements and through this I earned my “play” money. And, what did I intend to do with my “play” money? I wanted to invest in bitcoin.</p><h2>My First Steps</h2><p>In 2010, with Bitcoin’s <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Genesis_block">genesis block</a> having been mined just one year prior, I came across some stories about this wonder-currency. I was intrigued and interested in investing. I struggled trying to find enough information and to sort through the comments for and against it. The challenges were massive. It seemed easier just to forget about it and go drink another espresso. </p><p>How could I invest? How could I sort through the many technical aspects? I felt like I needed to have a degree in programming. Moreover, I had concerns that if I did figure out where to buy it and how to hold it, then was I going to get some virus on my PC as a result or be pursued by someone from the dark side after I did? Could I be subjected to the many scams or hacks that I was reading about? </p><p>It is sad to think, however, that even 14 years since the genesis block, some of these impediments remain for many people, stifling greater Bitcoin adoption. </p><h2>Asking The ‘Expert’</h2><p>As I mentioned earlier, my then boyfriend/fiancé was apparently a financial expert. I mean, he was advising governments on their finances and economic development. He had been investing in stock markets since he was a teenager. So, why not ask him for help and his thoughts? </p><p>One weekend while in Singapore, I sprung the news and my questions. I recall that day so vividly. I mentioned Bitcoin and my desire to buy $100 worth and sell it after it grew to $1,000 worth. I thought it was fine to gamble a small amount because, even if I lost it all, I would somehow survive the loss… perhaps with only a few hours spent at a therapist. </p><p>Anyway, this is what I heard: </p><p>“What? Bitcoin? That’s just for use by scammers and prostitutes.” </p><p>OK, I forgot to ask how he knew that but, anyway, the discussion continued. I chalked his abrupt comment up to the fact that he had just finished drinking a double-shot, tall cappuccino with one pump of hazelnut syrup and was hyped full of caffeine and sugar. </p><p>I replied that I have researched it and understood that it is a token for the gaming sector, an industry that was growing fast. It can increase in value, I added. It can maybe reach $10 someday! I then also reminded him that he promised to buy me a gift — yes, the elusive FitFlops — when next in Singapore. I said that, rather than buying me those magic shoes, I will just use the money to buy bitcoin instead. Now, I could have easily bought bitcoin with my own money, but I wanted to do this as a mutual decision, for the future. And I was not a financial expert, so I thought it still best to seek his input. The discussion continued and I finally got him to agree to research Bitcoin further with me. </p><h2>Boyfriend/Expert/Panicked Investor</h2><p>Over the next few days, we both tried to find more information on Bitcoin and possible on-ramps. I found one small and seemingly-elusive Bitcoin group in Singapore. It seemed at that time that to buy some bitcoin, you had to know the right people. </p><p>I felt that, at least since this group was in Singapore, a highly-policed and -regulated state, that I would not be subject to the many scam sales and post-purchase hacks to steal the coins that existed back then. </p><p>I wondered how to get in touch with the group and even if I did, how could I know that they were for real? Nonetheless, I was willing to take a chance since I would only put in around $100, just my FitFlop money. My boyfriend/fiancé/expert had a different view. He was old-style, a conservative investor. He was one who followed the Warren Buffett approach. Remember, Warren Buffett <a href="https://financialpost.com/investing/buffetts-apple-losses-make-his-track-record-in-tech-even-worse">didn’t invest in any technology stocks until relatively late</a>. The potential to lose $100 sent him into a panic, even if the upside could turn that into $1,000!</p><h2>Wearing Bitcoin On My Feet</h2><p>After finally breaking down my Warren Buffett protégé/panicked boyfriend into agreeing to consider Bitcoin, I tried to reach the elusive Bitcoin group. No email replies, no phone numbers, no address to visit. It seemed that the only outcome of my Singaporean Bitcoin adventure would be to own a pair of FitFlops. My outreach and research continued over the next few days but to no avail. It appeared that Bitcoin, and the potential to make big returns, would have to be saved for a select few techies or traditional wealthy insiders. I left Singapore wearing what should have been my bitcoin on my feet. </p><h2>My First Bitcoin And My Last FitFlops</h2><p>The years passed. I tried to occasionally catch an article or other news about Bitcoin. Even as I learned more about how to buy and hold it, I was busy working and traveling and found it impossible to find any trustworthy Bitcoin sources to invest in across developing Asia. The region was not the best place to do such research. Even after the founding of some crypto exchanges, they did not serve customers outside the U.S. </p><p>The start of my Bitcoin journey had to wait until around 2019. While I missed out on the early days of Bitcoin, I can at least take solace that my feet have been happy and comfortable over the decade. </p><p>Finally, you might now ask what happened to my then boyfriend-slash-fiancé? Well, that’s for another article…</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Enza Coin.

The gathering, organized by NGO <a href="https://bitcoinargentina.org/">Bitcoin Argentina</a>, marks the organization's ten-year anniversary and aims to promote the advantages of Bitcoin and the blockchain ecosystem.</p><p>With the support of numerous companies and organizations in the sector, thousands of participants are expected to send a strong message about monetary and financial freedom. Jimena Vallone, the executive director of Bitcoin Argentina, expressed her excitement about the event, stating, "June 10 will be historic for the crypto community. For the first time, a giant human '₿' will be assembled with thousands of people to show that in the face of a world in crisis, unstable, the crypto industry is stronger than ever."</p><figure>

Assange, who is wanted on 18 charges related to the release of confidential U.S. military records and diplomatic cables, will, however, renew his appeal next week according to a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/julian-assange-loses-us-extradition-challenge-will-renew-appeal-next-week-2023-06-09/">report by Reuters</a>. The British High Court ruled that Assange had no legal grounds to challenge the extradition decision.</p><p>Previously, a British judge ruled against Assange's extradition, citing concerns about his mental health and the risk of suicide if held in a maximum security prison. However, the decision was overturned on appeal after the U.S. authorities provided assurances, including the possibility of transferring Assange to Australia to serve any sentence.</p><p>WikiLeaks gained prominence in 2010 for releasing classified files and diplomatic cables, marking one of the largest security breaches in U.S. military history. As a journalist, Assange’s platform highlighted war crimes and incredible breaches of public trust by the U.S. military. His efforts to bring crimes and actions committed by the government to light have been met with furious retaliation despite the protections journalists should receive, even when reporting on sensitive information. To punish Assange for his work is to set the precedent that journalists who delve too deeply into government affairs will be made an example of. </p><p>Assange's case has drawn international attention and sparked debates regarding freedom of the press and the potential implications for whistleblowers. The renewed appeal next week will be a crucial moment in determining Assange's fate as he continues to fight against extradition to the United States.</p><figure>

In 2000, he launched Echovox, which he spun out into Zong in 2008 — a mobile platform that let users pay for things online directly through their mobile phone bills. When this venture was acquired by PayPal in 2011, Marcus joined the digital payments giant, becoming its president the next year.</p><p>He’d read the Bitcoin white paper shortly after it was published, but “didn’t fall into the rabbit hole” at first, he recalled in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine. Then, in 2012, Argentina ordered PayPal to stop all transactions that would send money out of the country as it grappled with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_fiscal_austerity_in_Argentina">currency inflation and a fiscal austerity effort</a>, and the real value of this peer-to-peer electronic cash system started to resonate with him.</p><p>“We had to (comply), we were a regulated entity,” Marcus explained. “The day that happened, bitcoin prices went up significantly and I was like, ‘Whoa.’ Like, this is something where consumers in a place like Argentina are actually rushing into bitcoin as a way to move money that they’ve earned — it’s their money — in a way that they saw fit. So, I felt that was a very eye-opening moment for me in terms of Bitcoin being an escape valve to certain behaviors that weren’t aligned with my views of self sovereignty, of money … so that was kind of a turning point for me in 2013, where it really solidified my conviction.”</p><p>Shortly afterward, in May 2013, he attended the <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/5/prweb10692708.htm">Bitcoin 2013 conference</a> in San Jose and, despite its relatively small community, he was intrigued by the breakthrough Bitcoin had made in how digital payments could be facilitated. </p><p>“It was really a handful, like two handfuls of people basically, it was so incredibly early,” he said. “I was fascinated by this general idea that you move value in a completely self-sovereign way without any intermediaries whatsoever. And during that same time period, I remember sending and receiving bitcoins, and I was setting up wallets for friends to show them what was possible: ‘Look, this is me sending you money and there’s no one in between, right?’ And I was really fascinated by it.”</p><h2>To The Best Of Our Abilities</h2><p>But Marcus was not yet ready to give up on the possibility of institutionalized yet open payments for the internet. In June 2014, he joined Meta (then Facebook) as its vice president of messaging products, developing the Facebook Messenger mobile app. Marcus released <a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/fb-better-have-my-money">Messenger P2P Payments</a> in 2015, which allowed users to send each other money from their synced checking accounts via the app. </p><p>By mid-2019, Marcus had begun leading Facebook’s cryptocurrency project, Libra, which was later renamed Diem before being abandoned altogether. Libra was <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/facebooks-libra-is-here-but-it-might-not-be-what-you-think">almost instantly dismissed by Bitcoiners</a> as offering nothing particularly valuable compared to other centralized digital currency projects. And Marcus found himself defending the project before <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/libra-congress-chance-define-bitcoin-libra-isnt">the House Financial Services Committee</a> as well as <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/senate-hearing-facebooks-iffy-reputation-looms-libra-plans">the U.S. Senate’s banking committee</a>, forced to answer questions that were often more broadly focused on Meta’s history of invading user privacy.</p><p>But before Libra settled on the permissioned, oligarchical node model <a href="https://sls.gmu.edu/pfrt/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/LibraWhitePaper_en_US-Rev0723.pdf">outlined in its white paper</a>, Marcus had actually considered leveraging the Lightning Network for his project.</p><p>“I remember meeting with Elizabeth Stark (CEO of Lightning Network development firm Lightning Labs) in early 2018 and trying to figure out whether Lightning was actually the way to go, because if there was a way to actually use Bitcoin, I really wanted to do that,” Marcus said. “At the time, we thought, OK, maybe we can use Lightning and then build a world-class wallet that we can embed across all of the Meta products, WhatsApp and Messenger and others, and then enable people to move value around.”</p><p>Ultimately, he decided the protocol wasn’t robust enough to fulfill Meta’s vision due to some of the insufficiencies that it has yet to overcome, including limited nodes and liquidity.</p><p>“Even today, it would be challenging, and it will be challenging, to actually get to billions of consumers on the Lightning Network,” Marcus pointed out. “Even Layer 1 won’t have enough HTLCs (<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Hash_Time_Locked_Contracts">hash time locked contracts</a>) to actually do that. So, we’ll have to find solutions as we get there. But our view was that it won’t scale… And as such, we came to the conclusion that we need to go build this proprietary technology that we will then do whatever we can to decentralize to the best of our abilities.”</p><p>In the end, Marcus’ ability to decentralize a payments project under Meta proved insufficient and he has since come to the realization that attempting to do so on any other network aside from Bitcoin is an exercise in futility.</p><p>“We’ve built the unshakeable conviction at this point that the only blockchain and the only underlying assets that can support a truly open protocol for payments on the internet is Bitcoin and nothing else,” he said.</p><p>In 2021, Marcus left Meta and the next year he launched Lightspark to pursue that conviction.</p><h2>The Reason Bitcoin And Lightning Are Better</h2><p>Lightspark builds software and development tools meant to make accessing the Lightning Network easier, such as its <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/lightspark-introduces-lightspark-wallet-sdk">software development kit</a> to help businesses offer Lightning wallets to their customers and <a href="https://www.lightspark.com/products">Lightspark Predict</a>, which identifies the best-performing Lightning nodes and can route transactions to them.</p><p>Rather than building a centralized platform to enable digital payments, Lightspark is focused on building tools to help customers access this existing, decentralized one. And while Lightning Network adoption is still far from rivaling the user base of something like PayPal, Marcus is optimistic about its potential to scale if companies like his are successful.</p><p>“Lightning still has issues, but I feel very confident that we’re in a position to address these issues,” he said. “You’ll see that for companies to integrate on Lightning using Lightspark services, you don’t even need to worry about channels. You don’t need to worry about liquidity. You don’t need to worry about channel rebalancing and distributing liquidity. You don’t need to worry about what routes you’re going to use and which minimum fee or maximum fee you’re going to set. All of that complexity is being completely taken away from the equation of a company deciding whether they’re going to implement Lightning for their consumers or not.”</p><p>When asked if abstracting users so far away from managing their own liquidity, channel balances and routing could in a sense recreate the issues with centralized, trusted financial middlemen, Marcus responded with an analogy.</p><p>“In the early days of the web, if you wanted a website and you wanted to be on the internet, you had to go build your own server, find a rack, put it in a rack, buy a router, configure your router, get an E1 or a T1 line, plug that router into your E1 or T1 line and then maintain that whole thing all the time, and it was like, OK, no one does that,” he explained. “But the reason Lightning and Bitcoin are better is because there are companies like Lightspark that will make things easier for mass market adoption, but if you are in a random country anywhere, and you just have internet connectivity, you can run a node on your phone yourself and be a participant in this network. And I think that’s what makes it amazing.”</p><p>And he went further to underscore that his intention now is to enable a certain kind of Lightning adoption, rather than roll out a solution that minimizes the need for independent participants. </p><p>“We don’t expect everyone to use our software,” he continued. “That would actually be a bad thing, right? We think that everyone should run their own thing and we’re going to cater to a certain segment of the market that is going to tend to be larger, enterprise-types of customers.”</p><p>Of all the executives actively working on Bitcoin projects, Marcus probably has the most legacy experience to inform him on what Bitcoin needs to succeed as well as what it must avoid in order not to fail. And, declaring that building on Lightning is the culmination of his life’s work, he’s determined to succeed.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk4NTQ0NDMzNTE4NDg2OTc5/david-marcus.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[If We’re Not Careful, The AI Revolution Could Become The ‘Great Homogenization’]]></title><description><![CDATA[As artificial intelligence grows, so do attempts to control it.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a paradigm-shifting technological breakthrough, but probably not for the reasons you might think or imagine.</p><p>You’ve probably heard something along the lines of, “Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is around the corner,” or, “Now that language is solved, the next step is conscious AI.”</p><p>Well… I’m here to tell you that those concepts are both <em>red herrings</em>. They are either the naive delusions of technologists who believe God is in the circuits, or the deliberate incitement of fear and hysteria by more malevolent people with ulterior motives.</p><p>I <em>do not</em> think AGI is a threat or that we have an “AI safety problem,” or that we’re around the corner from some singularity with machines. </p><p><em>But…</em></p><p>I do believe this technological paradigm shift poses a significant threat to humanity — which is in fact, about the <em>only</em> thing I can somewhat agree on with the mainstream — but for completely different reasons. </p><p>To learn what they are, let’s first try to understand what's really happening here.</p><h2>Introducing… The Stochastic Parrot!</h2><p>Technology is an amplifier. It makes the good better, and the bad worse.</p><p>Just as a hammer is technology that can be used to build a house or beat someone over the head, computers can be used to document ideas that change the world, or they can be used to operate central bank digital currencies (CDBCs) that enslave you into crazy, communist cat ladies working at the European Central Bank.</p><p>The same goes for AI. It is a tool. It is a technology. It is <em>not</em> a new lifeform, despite what the lonely nerds who <a href="https://time.com/6266923/ai-eliezer-yudkowsky-open-letter-not-enough/">are calling for progress to shut down</a> so desperately want to believe. </p><p>What makes generative AI so interesting is not that it is sentient, but that it’s the first time in our history that we are “speaking” or communicating with something other than a human being, in a coherent fashion. The closest we’ve been to that before this point has been with… parrots. </p><p>Yes: <em>parrots</em>!</p><p>You can train a parrot to kind of talk and talk back, and you can kind of understand it, but because we know it’s not really a human and doesn’t really understand anything, we’re not so impressed.</p><p>But generative AI… well, that’s a different story. We’ve been acquainted with it for six months now (in the mainstream) and we have no real idea how it works under the hood. We type some words, and it responds like that annoying, politically-correct, midwit nerd who you know from class… or your average Netflix show.</p><p>In fact, you’ve probably even spoken with someone like this during support calls to Booking.com, or any other service in which you’ve had to dial in or web chat. As such, you’re immediately shocked by the responses. </p><p>“Holy shit,” you tell yourself. “This thing speaks like a real person!”</p><p>The English is immaculate. No spelling mistakes. Sentences make sense. It is not only grammatically accurate, but semantically so, too.</p><p><em>Holy shit! It must be alive!</em></p><figure>

    </figure><p>Little do you realize that you are speaking to a highly-sophisticated, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_parrot">stochastic parrot</a>. As it turns out, language is a little more rules-based than what we all thought, and probability engines can actually do an excellent job of <em>emulating</em> intelligence through the frame or conduit of language.</p><p>The law of large numbers strikes again, and math achieves another victory!</p><p>But… what does this mean? What the hell is my point? </p><p>That this is not useful? That it’s proof it’s not a path to AGI?</p><p>Not necessarily, on both counts.</p><p>There is lots of utility in such a tool. In fact, the greatest utility probably lies in its application as “MOT,” or “Midwit Obsolescence Technology.” Woke journalists and the countless “content creators” who have for years been talking a lot but saying nothing, are now like dinosaurs watching the comet incinerate everything around them. It’s a beautiful thing. Life wins again.</p><p>Of course, these tools are also great for ideating, coding faster, doing some high-level learning, etc.</p><p>But from an AGI and consciousness standpoint, <em>who knows?</em> There mayyyyyyyyyyy be a pathway there, but my spidey sense tells me we’re way off, so I’m not holding my breath. I think consciousness is so much more complex, and to think we’ve conjured it up with probability machines is some strange blend of ignorant, arrogant, naive and… well… empty.</p><p>So, what the hell is my problem and what’s the risk?</p><h2>Enter The Age Of The LUI</h2><p>Remember what I said about tools.</p><p>Computers are arguably the most powerful tool mankind has built. And computers have gone through the following evolution:</p><ol><li>Punch cards</li><li>Command line</li><li>Graphical user interface, i.e., point and click</li><li>Mobile, i.e., thumbs and tapping</li></ol><figure>

        <figcaption><em>Source: Author</em></figcaption>
    </figure><p>And now, we’re moving into the age of the LUI, or “Language User Interface.”</p><p><em>This</em> is the big paradigm shift. It’s not AGI, but LUI. Moving forward, every app we interact with will have a conversational interface, and we will no longer be limited by the bandwidth of how fast our fingers can tap on keys or screens. </p><p>Speaking “language” is orders of magnitude faster than typing and tapping. Thinking is probably another level higher, but I’m not putting any electrodes into my head anytime soon. In fact, LUIs probably obsolete the need for Neuralink-type tech because the risks associated with implanting chips into your brain will outweigh any marginal benefit over just speaking.</p><p>In any case, this decade we will go from tapping on graphical user interfaces, to talking to our apps.</p><p>And therein lies the danger.</p><p>In the same way Google today determines what we see in searches, and Twitter, Facebook, Tik Tok and Instagram all “feed us” through their feeds; generative AI will tomorrow determine the answers to every question we have.</p><p>The screen not only becomes the lens through which you ingest everything about the world. The screen becomes your model of the world.</p><p>Mark Bisone <a href="https://markbisone.substack.com/p/screen-grab">wrote a fantastic article</a> about this recently, which I urge you to read:</p><blockquote><p>“The problem of ‘screens’ is actually a very old one. In many ways it goes back to Plato’s cave, and perhaps is so deeply embedded in the human condition that it precedes written languages. That’s because when we talk about a screen, we’re really talking about the transmission of an illusory model in an editorialized form.</p><p>“The trick works like this: You are presented with the image of a thing (and these days, with the sound of it), which its presenter either explicitly tells you or strongly implies is a window to the Real. The shadow and the form are the same, in other words, and the former is to be trusted as much as any fragment of reality that you can directly observe with your sensory organs.”</p></blockquote><p>And, for those thinking that “this won’t happen for a while,” well <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/g7-leaders-confirm-need-governance-generative-ai-technology-2023-05-19/">here are the bumbling fools making a good attempt at it</a>.</p><h2>The ‘Great Homogenization’</h2><p>Imagine every question you ask, every image you request, every video you conjure up, every bit of data you seek, being returned in such a way that is deemed “safe,” “responsible” or “acceptable” by some faceless “safety police.”</p><p>Imagine every bit of information you consume has been transformed into some lukewarm, middle version of the truth, that every opinion you ask for is not really an opinion or a viewpoint, but some inoffensive, apologetic response that doesn’t actually tell you anything (this is the benign, annoying version) or worse, is some ideology wrapped in a response so that everything you know becomes some variation of what the manufacturers of said “safe AI” want you to think and know.</p><p>Imagine you had modern Disney characters, like those clowns from “The Eternals” movie, as your ever-present intellectual assistants. It would make you “dumb squared.”</p><p>“<a href="https://www.amazon.com/UnCommunist-Manifesto-Message-Responsibility-Liberty/dp/0578396300">The UnCommunist Manifesto</a>” outlined the utopian communist dream as the grand homogenization of man:<em> </em></p><p><em>If only everyone were a series of numbers on a spreadsheet, or automatons with the same opinion, it would be so much easier to have paradise on earth. You could ration out just enough for everyone, and then we’d be all equally miserable proletariats.</em></p><p>This is like George Orwell’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_Police">thought police</a> crossed with “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception">Inception</a>,” because every question you had would be perfectly captured and monitored, and every response from the AI could incept an ideology in your mind. In fact, when you think about it, that’s what information does. It plants seeds in your mind.</p><p>This is why you need a diverse set of ideas in the minds of men! You want a flourishing rainforest in your mind, not some mono-crop field of wheat, with deteriorated soil, that is susceptible to weather and insects, and completely dependent on Monsanto (or Open AI or Pfizer) for its survival. You want your mind to flourish and for that <em>you need idea-versity</em><em>.</em></p><p>This was the promise of the internet. A place where anyone can say anything. The internet has been a force for good, but it is under attack. Whether that’s been the de-anonymization of social profiles like those on Twitter and Facebook, and the creeping KYC across all sorts of online platforms, through to the algorithmic vomit that is spewed forth from the platforms themselves. We tasted that in <em>all</em> its glory from 2020. And it seems to be only getting worse.</p><p>The push by WEF-like organizations to institute KYC for online identities, and tie it to a CBDC and your iris is one alternative, but it’s a bit overt and explicit. After the pushback on medical experimentation of late, such a move may be harder to pull off. An easier move could be to allow LUIs to take over (as they will, because they’re a superior user experience) and in the meantime create an “AI safety council” that will institute “safety” filters on all major large language models (LLMs).</p><p>Don’t believe me? <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/g7-leaders-confirm-need-governance-generative-ai-technology-2023-05-19/">Our G7 overlords are discussing it already</a>.</p><p>Today, the web is still made up of webpages, and if you’re curious enough, you can find the deep, dark corners and crevices of dissidence. You can still surf the web. Mostly. But when everything becomes accessible only through these models, you’re not surfing anything anymore. You’re simply being given a synthesis of a response that has been run through all the necessary filters and censors. </p><p>There will probably be a sprinkle of truth somewhere in there, but it will be wrapped up in so much “safety” that 99.9% of people won’t hear or know of it. The truth will become that which the model says it is.</p><p>I’m not sure what happens to much of the internet when discoverability of information fundamentally transforms. I can imagine that, as most applications transition to some form of language interface, it’s going to be very hard to find things that the “portal” you’re using doesn’t deem safe or approved.</p><p>One could, of course, make the argument that in the same way you need the tenacity and curiosity to find the dissident crevices on the web, you’ll need to learn to prompt and hack your way into better answers on these platforms. </p><p>And that may be true, but it seems to me that for each time you find something “unsafe,” the route shall be patched or blocked.</p><p>You could then argue that “this could backfire on them, by diminishing the utility of the tool.” </p><p>And once again, I would probably agree. In a free market, such stupidity would make way for better tools.</p><p>But of course, the free market is becoming a thing of the past. What we are seeing with these hysterical attempts to push for “safety” is that they are either knowingly or unknowingly paving the way for squashing possible alternatives.</p><p>In creating “safety” committees that “regulate” these platforms (read: regulate speech), new models that are not run through such “safety or toxicity filters” will not be available for consumer usage, or they may be made illegal, or hard to discover. How many people still use Tor? Or DuckDuckGo?</p><p>And if you think this isn’t happening, <a href="https://medium.com/jigsaw/reducing-toxicity-in-large-language-models-with-perspective-api-c31c39b7a4d7">here’s</a> some information on the current toxicity filters that most LLMs already plug into. It’s only a matter of time before such filters become like KYC mandates on financial applications. A new compliance appendage, strapped onto language models like tits on a bull.</p><p>Whatever the counter-argument to this homogenization attempt, both actually support my point that we need to build alternatives, and we need to begin that process now.</p><p>For those who still tend to believe that AGI is around the corner and that LLMs are a significant step in that direction, by all means, you’re free to believe what you want, but that doesn’t negate the point of this essay.</p><p>If language is the new “screen” and all the language we see or hear must be run through approved filters, the information we consume, the way we learn, the very thoughts we have, will all be narrowed into a very small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window">Overton window</a>.</p><p>I think that’s a massive risk for humanity.</p><p>We’ve become dumb enough with social media algorithms serving us what the platforms think we should know. And when they wanted to turn on the hysteria, it was easy. Language user interfaces are social media times 100.</p><p>Imagine what they can do with that, the next time a so-called “crisis” hits?</p><p>It won’t be pretty.</p><p>The marketplace of ideas is necessary to a healthy and functional society. That’s what I want.</p><p>Their narrowing of thought won’t work long term, because it’s anti-life. In the end, it will fail, just like every other attempt to bottle up truth and ignore it. But each attempt comes with unnecessary damage, pain, loss and catastrophe. That’s what I am trying to avoid and help ring the bell for.</p><h2>What To Do About All This?</h2><p>If we’re not proactive here, this whole AI revolution could become the “great homogenization.” To avoid that, we have to do <em>two</em> main things: </p><ol><li>Push back against the “AI safety” narratives: These might look like safety committees on the surface, but when you dig a little deeper, you realize they are speech and thought regulators.</li><li>Build alternatives, now: Build many and open source them. The sooner we do this, and the sooner they can run more locally, the better chance we have to avoid a world in which everything trends toward homogenization.</li></ol><p>If we do this, we can have a world with real diversity — not the woke kind of bullshit. I mean diversity of thought, diversity of ideas, diversity of viewpoints and a true marketplace of ideas.</p><p><em>An idea-versity.</em> What the original promise of the internet was. And not bound by the low bandwidth of typing and tapping. Couple that with Bitcoin, the internet of money, and you have the ingredients for a bright new future.</p><p>This is what the team and I are doing at Laier Two Labs. We’re building smaller, narrow models that people can use as substitutes to these large language models.</p><p>We are going to open source all our models, and in time, aim to have them be compact enough to run locally on your own machines, while retaining a degree of depth, character and unique bias for use when and where you need it most.</p><p>We will announce our first model in the coming weeks. The goal is to make it the go-to model for a topic and industry I hold very dear to my heart: Bitcoin. I also believe it’s here that we must start to build a suite of alternative AI models and tools.</p><p>I will unveil it on the next blog. Until then.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by </em><a href="https://linktree.com/Svetski"><em>Aleksandar Svetski</em></a><em>, founder of </em><a href="https://bitcointim.es/"><em>The Bitcoin Times</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://amber.app/"><em>The Amber App,</em></a><em> author of “</em><a href="http://www.uncommunist.com/"><em>The UnCommunist Manifesto</em></a><em>,” “</em><a href="https://authenticintelligence.substack.com/"><em>Authentic Intelligence</em></a><em>” and the up-coming “Bushido Of Bitcoin.” Opinions expressed are entirely their own and do not necessarily reflect those of BTC Inc or </em>Bitcoin Magazine<em>.</em></p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzOTk5NDg5MTkzNzQ4MTQ1/two-societies.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk4NTQ0MDM2MjM0MDEyNTgz/parrot.jpg" height="448" width="620" medium="image" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk4NTQ0MDM2MjM0MDEyMDk5/lui.png" height="207" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bitcoin Is Becoming A Lifeline For Political Dissidents In Myanmar]]></title><description><![CDATA[Following a military coup in 2021, resistance groups in Myanmar are in need of an alternative financial solution like Bitcoin.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/how-bitcoin-can-save-political-dissidents-in-myanmar</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/how-bitcoin-can-save-political-dissidents-in-myanmar</guid><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Asia]]></category><category><![CDATA[Freedom]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Win Ko Ko Aung]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jun 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwNTAxMzQ1MTY4NDY3ODY2/jail-censorship-guy-fawkes-freedom.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Win Ko Ko Aung, a McCourt Scholar for Georgetown University’s Data Science for Public Policy program and a survivor of Myanmar’s 2021 military coup.</em></p><p>As the 2024 U.S. Presidential election campaign kicked off, one of the candidates, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., took to Twitter to express his support for Bitcoin. <a href="https://twitter.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1654304979207815174?s=20">In a tweet</a>, he stated that “Bitcoin has been a lifesaver for people’s movements around the world, particularly in Burma.”</p><p>Myanmar, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar">also known as Burma</a>, is a country located in Southeast Asia, bordering China, India, Thailand, Laos and Bangladesh. The country has stunning natural beauty, including untouched beaches, vast forests and a rich culture of Buddhism. Despite these attractions, Myanmar has <a href="https://digitalcollections.sit.edu/capstones/2603/">been tortured by the world's longest civil war</a>, which has been ongoing for more than 70 years, since it achieved <a href="https://asiangeo.com/articles/the-road-to-independence-burma-1945-1962/">independence in 1945</a>. The country has also experienced multiple military coups throughout its history, leading to political instability and economic turmoil. Additionally, the <a href="https://rpl.hds.harvard.edu/religion-context/country-profiles/myanmar/economic-policies-and-ideologies">government has a history of demonetizing the local currency</a>, and there have been frequent banking crises. </p><p>One of Myanmar's most notable instances of demonetization occurred in 1987, leading to the historic "8888 Uprising." On September 5, 1987, the military dictator Ne Win <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-09-12-mn-1980-story.html">announced the demonetization of Myanmar's 25, 35, and 75 kyat notes</a> without providing prior notice or replacing them for citizens. At that time, these notes accounted for <a href="https://www.irrawaddy.com/specials/on-this-day/day-three-myanmar-banknotes-suddenly-became-worthless.html">80% of the circulation in the economy</a>. Previous demonetization efforts in 1964 and 1985 <a href="https://www.irrawaddy.com/specials/on-this-day/day-three-myanmar-banknotes-suddenly-became-worthless.html">had compensated noteholders</a>, making this move in 1987 especially unexpected and devastating for the people of Myanmar. The choice to demonetize these particular, odd denominations sparked significant speculation, as they were believed to hold special status. It is widely held that Ne Win, who was highly superstitious, considered these numbers to be propitious both for the country and himself on a personal level. </p><p>Myanmar's transformation era commenced with the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-obama-myanmar/obama-offers-praise-pressure-on-historic-myanmar-trip-idUSBRE8AI04320121119">visit of U.S. President Barack Obama to the country in 2012</a>, followed by its <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/11/11/asia/myanmar-elections/index.html">first civilian election in 2015</a>, which marked a significant milestone in the country's path toward democracy. However, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Myanmar_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat">2021 Myanmar military coup</a> has set the country back by a decade. The military's seizure of power in February 2021 has sparked widespread protests and violence across the country, with thousands of people taking to the streets to demand the release of detained political leaders, including the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/1/timeline-two-years-since-the-myanmar-military-coup">State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi and President U Win Myint</a> and the restoration of democracy.</p><p>But following the military coup in February 2021, the military has brutally cracked down on civilians who are protesting against the regime. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-57380237">Reports indicate</a> that the military has resorted to extreme measures to suppress dissent, including shooting protesters on the spot and arresting individuals, some of whom have been found dead the following day. The military junta has also taken steps to silence activists and journalists who have spoken out against the coup on social media by <a href="https://coconuts.co/yangon/news/myanmar-bank-faces-boycott-after-freezing-accounts-to-block-donations-to-anti-coup-forces/">freezing their bank accounts</a>, making it difficult for them to access their funds and personal savings. These actions have led to widespread condemnation from the international community and have raised concerns about the deteriorating human rights situation in Myanmar.</p><p>A source from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ANTSforPeople">ANTS</a>, a group that raises funds for the democracy movement in Myanmar, revealed to me that many of their members and their friends had their bank accounts frozen by the military regime since they started fundraising efforts in October 2021. These efforts have also led to the arrests and questioning of the family members of activists. In response to the situation, a 22-year-old activist from ANTS told me, "To overcome getting their bank accounts frozen, ANTS changed its fundraising strategy to take bank information privately and instruct donors to write online shopping payment in the note section to reduce the risk of exposure." </p><p>Assisting resistance groups in Myanmar poses a significant danger for individuals irrespective of social hierarchy. Even a donation of less than $10 to these groups <a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/prison-terms-04062022170714.html">has led to ten years of prison sentences for some individuals</a>. In one instance, a well-known jeweler in the Mandalay region was arrested for allegedly supporting the resistance, resulting in the seizure of his assets, including properties, businesses and an <a href="https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/burma/myanmar-gems-boss-arrested-for-alleged-resistance-support.html">astounding 193 tons of raw jade</a> valued at approximately 12 billion kyat (equivalent to roughly $5.7 million).</p><h2>Alternatives, But Not Solutions</h2><p>Furthermore, the group revealed that they have explored alternative digital payment options such as <a href="https://nugpay.app/">NUGPay</a>, a pilot digital currency platform launched by Myanmar's parallel government, the <a href="https://www.nugmyanmar.org/en/">National Unity Government </a>(NUG). However, as one of their members explained, "Our donors are hesitant to use the platform because it requires opening a bank account with an agent who is either inside Myanmar or outside of Myanmar. Who can guarantee that it is purely safe for the agent and users in terms of data security? It looks like having a double risk than using the traditional banking system.”</p><p>But NUGPay, a digital currency platform built on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_(payment_network)#:~:text=Stellar%20is%20an%20open%2Dsource,communicate%20with%20other%20Stellar%20servers.">open-source Stellar network</a>, has faced concerns over data security from many people. </p><p>As of May 28, 2023, the <a href="https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/asset/DMMK-GDMMKKNI5KTQWFEI57ZTCAPFUJFGQSW5YUN5AJ4O2I25JXEU3IL2DZXD-1?filter=payments">Stellar blockchain had recorded 26,950 trustlines using the platform</a>. However, the mobile app Exxon Film Investment — which allegedly enticed users with interest-yield incentives — had <a href="https://www.mizzimaburmese.com/article/126642">managed to scam more than 30,000 people in Myanmar</a>, creating a number of users who are now discouraged from exploring digital currencies like Bitcoin that exceeds the entire user base of NUGPay, highlighting the challenges of ensuring the security of digital financial transactions in Myanmar.</p><p>"I think from my experience, many local young people still do not believe in the potential of digital currency,” Feliz, the founder of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/myancryptocurrency">Myan Crypto</a>, a local crypto educational community, told me. “It is still skeptical in our community. Not to mention senior citizens."</p><p>He added, "Many people in our community came to the Bitcoin and crypto trading industry because they are kind of rich in cash but they don’t know what to do in this economic fallout."</p><p>Regarding NUGPay, Feliz expressed concerns about its limited adoption, saying, "I think the problem of NUGPay is limited adoption. You can’t use it as a currency outside of the revolution group. I think it needs widespread adoption everywhere to make it as an effective currency. Even some people who trade bitcoin and crypto don’t use or hesitate to use the NUGPay due to its limited acceptance. Even (a) user not under military reach doesn’t know what to use NUGPay for other than supporting the resistance.”</p><h2>How Bitcoin Can Help Those Resisting The Military In Myanmar</h2><p>But Bitcoin could serve as a better alternative for those in Myanmar who are being cut off from traditional banking services or fear currency devaluation.</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/MizzimaDaily/posts/pfbid02E3XzCQ2qoLcGoe5q5Wvnsh2YuSb4QamR49yjB95iqjNE4eeQEwTxA3XaLFTJbB4jl?_rdc=1&amp;_rdr">Research</a> conducted by the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Bitcoin.MM.Initiative/">Bitcoin Myanmar Initiative</a> shows that, while the value of the kyat has fallen by over 35% since the military coup, the price of bitcoin has doubled in the same period. Prior to the coup, the price of 1 BTC was approximately 500 million kyat, but it is hovering around 1 billion kyat on <a href="https://p2p.binance.com/en/trade/all-payments/BTC?fiat=MMK">Binance’s peer-to-peer exchange</a> as of this writing. </p><p>"We believe that the adoption of bitcoin and other digital currencies in Myanmar will be a gradual process, given the current economic environment and the fragile risk tolerance of the majority of people," a representative of the Bitcoin Myanmar Initiative told me. "However, we see the potential for growth due to the country's previous experiences with technology leapfrogging. With a smartphone penetration rate of 78% and only 36% of the population having a bank account, many people in Myanmar are looking for an alternative to traditional banking. By promoting a form of currency that no one can control, we aim to help people reclaim their property rights in a digital way and unleash themselves from the military regime's monetary policy. We believe that it's just a matter of time before more people in Myanmar recognize the benefits of Bitcoin."</p><p>Highlighting another powerful example of how Bitcoin can help those in Myanmar in “<a href="https://store.bitcoinmagazine.com/collections/books/products/check-your-financial-privilege">Check Your Financial Privilege</a>,” author Alex Gladstein wrote that:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>“As a personal example, someone reached out to me at the beginning of the Myanmar revolution in February 2021. They wanted to provide aid to the democracy movement, but the banking system was practically shuttered, and there was no easy way to wire dollars. After doing some digging, we were introduced to an aid worker-turned-activist who was also a Bitcoin user. He could easily accept a donation, save it in BTC, and then sell it on the peer-to-peer markets when he needed to spend the collapsing local kyat currency on goods. An address was sent over Signal, and a gift was made in minutes. No barriers, no middlemen, and no possibility for corruption along the way. It is just one small example, but it is a glimpse of what the future could hold.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><em>This is a guest post by Win Ko Ko Aung.

According to <a href="https://blog.bitgo.com/bitgo-signs-letter-of-intent-to-acquire-prime-trust-to-expand-digital-asset-and-fintech-b1868391784a">a blog posted by BitGo</a>, the acquisition aims to bring business continuity, long-term stability and regulated, secure services to Prime Trust clients.</p><p>Prime Trust expressed excitement about the potential partnership. Jor Law, Prime Trust's Interim CEO and President, said he believes that the combination of Prime Trust and BitGo will be a game-changer for the industry, stating, "No other company will have the breadth of product and services nor depth of experience that this combined company would have. We are excited to offer our world-class infrastructure within a broader ecosystem and revolutionize the future of crypto."</p><p>The blog posting listed the benefits the acquisition could hold for both companies. First, it noted that Prime Trust's Nevada Trust Company will join BitGo's global network of regulated trust companies, which already includes entities in South Dakota, New York, Germany and Switzerland. In addition, the expansion would enhance BitGo's presence and regulatory reach. Furthermore, the blog described how Prime Trust's fintech API infrastructure and exchange network will reinforce BitGo's existing services, including custody, liquidity, settlement and compliance capabilities.</p><p>Mike Belshe, CEO and Co-Founder of BitGo, views the acquisition as a milestone transaction that will contribute to a more secure and sustainable future for the digital asset landscape.

    </figure><p>What if I told you that the largest pension fund in the United States could be rescued by Bitcoin? Furthermore, what if it could happen in a way that maintains 100% of its primary portfolio investments in traditional markets? I know. For those who don’t “Bitcoin,” many of you will stop here. But I urge you to read on a bit further. And for those who do Bitcoin, there is likely a pension near you facing a similar dilemma.</p><p>By incorporating bitcoin into the <a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/page/employers/benefit-programs/ceppt">California Employers Pension Prefunding Trust Fund</a> (CEPPT), California could continue to deliver on its commitment to its workforce and retirees, without having to make employees work longer years while paying more into the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (<a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/">CalPERS</a>) fund. Additionally, if California doesn’t want to do this, municipalities could and should do it on their own regardless by funding what I call a “Bitcoin Municipal Employers Pension Prefunding Trust (MEPPT).” In doing so, cities and public agencies could escape the redundant fate of unfunded liability payments.</p><p>Why bitcoin? Unlike other assets, “Bitcoin has no risk of liquidation,” as explained by Mickey Koss in a recent article, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/pension-funds-must-adopt-bitcoin">“Pension Funds Must Adopt Bitcoin or Risk Insolvency.”</a> “Bitcoin does not require leverage. Instead of making risky bets, perpetuating the culture of moral hazard and socialized losses, pension funds can use bitcoin as an asymmetric opportunity in order to bolster their returns.”</p><h2>The CalPERS Crisis</h2><p>With a total value of roughly $440 billion dollars, CalPERS is the largest “defined benefit” public pension in the nation, and <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1314998/public-pension-funds-worldwide-based-on-assets-under-management/#:~:text=Leading%20global%20public%20pension%20funds%202022%2C%20by%20assets%20under%20management&amp;text=Japan's%20Government%20Pension%20Investment%20Fund,worth%201.32%20trillion%20U.S.%20dollars.">fifth-largest public pension in the world</a> as of 2022. Holding in its hands the financial fates of public employees, municipalities and public agencies in California, CalPERS’ main priority is to grow and maintain its fund. By doing so, it can deliver on its commitments, which are payments to retirees.</p><p>The funded status of any pension takes the form of a percentage. It is the total estimated value of the assets on hand as a percentage of the total obligation to pay retirees (its liabilities). As reported most recently in June 2022, <a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/docs/board-agendas/202211/financeadmin/item-6a-01_a.pdf">CalPERS holds an estimated funded status of 72%</a>. This is below the traditionally accepted “healthy” funded status <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundedstatus.asp">which is at least 80%</a>. Most simply, this means that the fund currently has the ability to liquidate its assets to obtain 72% of the funds needed to make all of its payments. Thus, 28% of its overall liabilities are unfunded.</p><p>California has a larger unfunded pension liability than any other state in the nation. A report released earlier last year by the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), found that unfunded pension liabilities nationwide have <a href="https://www.thecentersquare.com/california/article_b77e67bc-e842-11ec-ba2b-83e39b9717cd.html">climbed to $8.28 trillion</a>, “or just under $25,000 for every man, woman and child in the United States,” with California holding the nation’s largest public pension debt load.</p><p>CalPERS’ unfunded pension liability comes on the tail end of <a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/page/about/laws-legislation-regulations/public-employees-pension-reform-act">major pension reform in 2013</a>. The reform extended the retirement age of new employees and increased employee contributions into the fund. Additionally, the fund benefited from a massive injection of liquidity in the past few years. </p><p>Governor Newsom’s 2022 to 2023 “<a href="https://ebudget.ca.gov/2022-23/pdf/BudgetSummary/FullBudgetSummary.pdf">Governor's Budget Summary</a>” noted that “from 2017-18 through 2021-22, the state has made supplemental pension payments of $12.7 billion to CalPERS and CalSTRS (the California State Teachers Retirement System), with the goal of improving the funded status of both systems and reducing the state’s long-term retirement obligations.”</p><p>Despite both of these efforts over the past decade, a sustained improvement in CalPERS’ funded status has not arrived. On the eve of the next reporting period, all eyes are on the funded status and unfunded liability report that should arrive in June 2023. Fingers crossed.</p><h2>Unfunded Liabilities And Their Impacts</h2><p>An unfunded liability, quite simply, is the amount owed to keep a pension fund on pace to meet its obligations. Unfunded liabilities lead to extra payments, on top of the regular, annually-required payments to the pension, made by municipalities and public agencies. If you are scratching your head at this point, that’s normal. Pensions are complex with tons of variables, including the number of active employees/retirees, predicted life expectancy of retirees, cost-of-living adjustments, portfolio performance and more.</p><p>Unfunded liabilities don’t just disappear. They force CalPERS to request additional payments from municipalities and public agencies, on top of the normal payments made by those cities and agencies, as well as the contributions made by the employees into the pension fund.</p><p>These “extra” payments take a significant toll on cities. If unpaid, they accrue interest, and become looming burdens. I learned this after sitting on the pension advisory committee in my own city — a city with a long tradition of having an incredible public workforce. High-quality employees are so important. While this view is widely accepted in the private sector, it isn’t always so in the public sector. But some of the best-run and highest-revenue-earning cities understand and prioritize this. A dedicated public workforce is a tremendous benefit for the citizens of a city and visitors who receive city services. In the field of emergency services, that level of service can be the difference between life and death.</p><p>When municipalities have to pay unfunded liabilities on top of their normal pension payments, they either have to be extremely well off, or take away services from somewhere else to make the payments. </p><p>But luckily, we have an opportunity to escape this dilemma.</p><h2>How Bitcoin Can Fill The Unfunded Gap</h2><p>Enter Bitcoin. Bitcoin is an innovation with increasing global adoption, use and value. While the price has fluctuated greatly since its inception, Bitcoin’s network and community trajectory has <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/btc-adoption-vs-internet-kevin-maraj?trk=articles_directory">outpaced many comparable technological revolutions in their early years</a>. That includes the internet, cell phones and other major technological breakthroughs. Additionally, as an asset, when zooming out, its performance trends up.</p><p>Despite its upward trajectory, Bitcoin is still new and, therefore, turbulent and constantly adapting. It also has yet to be clearly defined by the legacy financial system and regulatory agencies, providing barriers to entry.</p><p>CalPERS could add bitcoin to its balance sheets. But an easier, more realistic course of action would be to utilize a tool it already created: the CEPPT. </p><p>The CEPPT is a separate, “<a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/page/employers/benefit-programs/ceppt">Section 115 trust fund dedicated to prefunding employer contributions to defined benefit pension systems for eligible California public agencies</a>.” Think of it as a side fund to cover the shortfalls of the main fund. The flaw with the current, non-Bitcoin CEPPT, is that the fund is based in the same system that brought about the need for a new side fund to begin with. Eventually, that fund will succumb to the same structural vulnerabilities as the CalPERS main pension portfolio. And then what? A pre-, pre-funding trust to pay the pre-funding trust?</p><p>CalPERS’ <a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/page/employers/benefit-programs/ceppt">CEPPT webpage</a> says that, since its inception, “more than 75 California public employers” are participating. My recommendation: Pivot, or if you are an elected city official, reconsider this strategy. Instead, establish a Bitcoin MEPPT. </p><p>The long-term returns of bitcoin represent the only asset class that can fill the holes, currently un-fillable, in the CalPERS pension fund. The cities that implement this will find themselves the beneficiaries of a healthy workforce and financial stability. They will bypass the painful dilemma of cutting key services to taxpayers in order to pay endless unfunded liabilities. They can avoid downgrading their workforce to the point that they are unable to recruit and retain high-quality personnel.</p><h2>Bitcoin CEPPT Or MEPPT: Easy First Step And Added Benefits</h2><p>With a Bitcoin CEPPT or MEPPT, public employers, cities, employees and CalPERS can safely enter the world of Bitcoin without moving funds out of its portfolio, which we know is very difficult.</p><p>A Bitcoin CEPPT run by the state could free California from its value-based investment dichotomy. That dichotomy: being a state that simultaneously funds and prioritizes renewable energy, while condemning <em>yet</em> financially supporting fossil fuels and big oil through its <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobeccles/2023/02/01/california-dreamin-calpers-and-calstrs-caught-in-climate-crossfire/?sh=1a93c1492b1c">roughly $42 billion</a> investment. The largest public fund investor of fossil fuels in the U.S. is CalPERS. It truly has one foot into the future while propping up the past.</p><p>A Bitcoin CEPPT could also include infrastructure components. A potential structure could allow California to further tap its <a href="https://www.eia.gov/state/analysis.php?sid=CA">abundant and steady renewable energy</a>, providing Bitcoin miners an opportunity to become even more climate friendly than they already are. In fact, a <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-uses-mostly-sustainable-energy">majority of Bitcoin mining captures either wasted energy sources or renewable energy</a>. Bitcoin miners that have proven useful as a grid-balancing partner, could take the place of household energy consumers in California during times when the power is often shut off, such as during its frequent <a href="https://www.weather.gov/media/lmk/pdf/what_is_a_red_flag_warning.pdf">red-flag warning, fire-weather days</a>. During these times, Southern California Edison is <a href="https://www.sce.com/outage-center/outage-information/psps">forced to balance the grid and shut off power to peoples’ homes</a>. </p><p>In these ways, and many more unmentioned ones, Bitcoin is a far better partner for <a href="https://batcoinz.com/BEEST/">California’s renewable energy goals</a>, then the big oil and fossil fuel Industry, currently capturing $42 billion, nearly 10% of CalPERS invested money!</p><p>For other states with similar issues, there are many exciting ways in which a Bitcoin CEPPT or MEPPT could be configured. There is even a tool called “<a href="https://nakamotoportfolio.com/">Nakamoto Portfolio</a>,” which was developed by Raphael Zagury, the CIO of Swan Financial. This tool allows funds to explore different configurations of how bitcoin could positively affect their portfolios based on past and predicted performances.</p><p>Despite its volatility, many legacy financial institutions predict the long-term value of bitcoin will continue to rise. Fidelity has even called for 1 Bitcoin to be valued at <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitcoin-worth-1-billion-2038-fidelity/">$1 million dollars by 2038</a>. That’s conservative, among some other long-term predictions. Many have compared Bitcoin to Apple, however it is much more than Apple. Apple changed the way in which the world interacts with technology. Bitcoin is simply going to change the world, and for the better and in ways we have yet to imagine.</p><p>In the likely event that Bitcoin is here to stay, this is a vehicle in which CalPERS can responsibly and slowly enter into the world of Bitcoin. Who knows, perhaps a Bitcoin CEPPT could prove worthy of primary portfolio contributions, to a point where it takes on a greater portion of CalPERS funds? </p><p>I’d like to see both ride off together into the California sunset: The CalPERS fund and Bitcoin CEPPT, giving California options to invest in ways truer to its core values, while supporting a vibrant and committed workforce.</p><p>To the cities and agencies who scoff at the idea of a Bitcoin CEPPT or MEPPT, I ask you an important question: If not Bitcoin, then what’s the plan to avoid bankruptcy or a declining workforce in your city due to runaway unfunded liabilities? To the unions and workers, how much longer are you willing to work and for how much less money, until we become more involved in the oversight of our own pension funds? And to CalPERS and the California legislature, you have a fiduciary obligation to those workers who built our state, to protect their funds and futures. Without another plan, cities, public employers and states owe it to the taxpayers and employees to explore Bitcoin and its promising future.</p><p>I am eager and happy to work with any union, city or elected official in the state to explore this as an option, at no cost. Why? Because I care about workers. As a firefighter and union leader, I’ve worked alongside a committed and amazing workforce, and I believe that when humans commit their most precious years to building something for their cities and states, they deserve the retirement that was promised on signup day.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Dom Bei.

We have been one of the pioneers in utilizing wasted flared gas energy for Bitcoin mining and had built 10 cryptocurrency mining facilities across eight states and Canada, operating with more than 200 megawatts (MWs) of power. </p><p>But 2022 was among the most challenging years for us and the entire Bitcoin mining industry. It was characterized by declining bitcoin prices and rising energy costs, influenced by the energy crisis provoked by the war in Ukraine. Many mining <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-miner-capitulation-could-set-price-bottom">companies declared bankruptcy</a>, and those that survived had to reconsider their operations.</p><p>Some companies managed to survive in a year-long crypto winter, one that is arguably not over yet, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/record-bitcoin-mining-despite-bear-market">record mining difficulty</a> and completely-frozen funding. From my six years of experience running a Bitcoin infrastructure company, there are a few solutions I can share that I hope will help others or offer insight into how resilient Bitcoin mining can be. This should not be considered a panacea for market downturns or managerial advice, but simply what I have learned for myself. </p><h2>First, We Called Our Power Providers </h2><p>The bull run over the last few years has shown that Bitcoin miners prioritize acquiring miners over securing relationships with utilities.</p><p>But we believe that prioritizing the securing of power, and all of the infrastructure behind it, is critical. Last year, the bankruptcies of mining companies taught us just that. Having open communications with power providers on realistic expectations always helps sketch a clear plan for getting power flowing safely and on time. </p><p>There are multiple reasons why utilities are incentivized to sell power to Bitcoin mining companies: First, they make a profit on every kilowatt-hour (kWh) sold. However, giving more incentives to the electricity supplier, such as load flexibility, the high-capacity factor and controlled load increase, helps build a stronger foundation among integral partners in the Bitcoin mining industry. From my experience, power providers do not see Bitcoin miners any differently than other electricity consumers, as long as the bills are paid on time. </p><p>When the energy crisis hit us, the first thing we did was to call our power company partners and tell them that all the bills would be paid. We started to run the extra mile, investing in relationships with them.</p><h2>Take A Hands-On Approach To Construction</h2><p>We all know that electricity bills often take up more than 90% of mining expenditures. However, the seed for a successful Bitcoin mining operation site is planted with the first conduit in the ground, even before the machines start buzzing. </p><p>Developing a Bitcoin mining farm is a tedious job, requiring many moving pieces to come together. Usually, we are so focused on the bitcoin price and mining difficulty that not enough time is spent on the design, site planning and construction of a well-run facility. This fundamental job is usually outsourced to a consulting firm, an engineering firm or someone else. </p><p>But the negligence in hands-on planning of an operation during the construction and development stage can cost a fortune going forward. Even the most professional construction firm most likely has yet to gain experience in building a Bitcoin mining farm. It must be guided by Bitcoin nerds who know about common power supply problems like ASIC overheating issues, firmware upgrades, etc. </p><p>We’ve learned that a well-built Bitcoin facility reduces operational, cooling, maintenance and uptime expenses for years. On the other hand, a poorly-designed site can lead to rebuilding a plane in the air. The worst nightmare can be when everything is set, and you realize that something crucial is wrong. It could be that the voltage on a transformer is incorrect, or the cable is not sized correctly to operate 24/7, 365 with a nearly-95% load factor, just to name a few potential issues. </p><p>Learning about transformers, substations and airflow during development helps avoid future mistakes. This type of involvement is more crucial than constantly negotiating the price of mining equipment online. From a simple business perspective, the depreciation rate on a mining farm project is more than a decade, relatively small compared to that of mining equipment which is only a couple of years. That is why we let the mining infrastructure sit and wait for ASICs. </p><p>Bitcoin mining operations are marathons, not sprints. They require hard work behind the scenes before the hash rate shows up in the pool. Therefore, when the second crypto winter hit us, our key company players rolled up their sleeves and put their best feet forward to ensure the business operations were set up for success. </p><h2>Think Creatively About Energy Consumption</h2><h3>Gas Flaring Mitigation </h3><p>As power demands and electricity costs continue to rise, miners must integrate their power generation vertically. They must find new ways to generate revenue that do not only depend on hash price. </p><p>In 2018, when the bitcoin price started to fall, we were looking for alternative and affordable power to stay afloat. The obvious idea was that to get the most affordable power, one needs to generate electricity to eliminate intermediaries. We then realized that there was no way we could generate hydro, wind or solar power with a limited budget. </p><p>However, gas and electric generation has been around for decades and is relatively simple. What about natural gas? We would not have to buy propane tanks to mine Bitcoin. There was no need when <a href="https://www.texasobserver.org/report-oil-companies-are-burning-off-natural-gas-and-leaving-regulators-in-the-dark/">billions of cubic feet of natural gas are burned annually in oil fields</a>. While drilling for oil, natural gas is released from the same reservoir. Sadly, the gas is flared due to a lack of infrastructure or economic feasibility in capturing it. That’s when I first realized that Bitcoin mining could be a tool that supplements the inefficiencies of the energy industry. Since then, we started <a href="https://ezblockchain.net/smartgrid/">mining Bitcoin on natural gas</a>.</p><h3>Flexible Loads </h3><p>The energy sector is transitioning from a fossil-fuels-dominated era to one of renewable power. Specifically, wind and solar are intermittent, adding stress to the grid. Our solution to inconsistent supply has been mixing renewable energy with natural gas-peaking power plants. These power plants are flexible enough to fire up the turbines within a few minutes’ notice to respond to the undersupply. </p><p>Those operations that are heavily dependent on renewables power grids need to implement a demand-response program where the grid incentivizes the users to reduce the load. This has become a game changer in power grid operation. By lowering the peak demand for energy, demand response programs reduce the need to construct new, expensive peaking generation units. However, since the introduction of the <a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/oeprod/DocumentsandMedia/FERC_NAPDR_-_final.pdf">National Action Plan On Demand Response</a> in 2010, more progress has yet to be achieved.</p><p>A decade since, Bitcoin mining is the game changer. It is the most flexible, efficient, financially-feasible and, most importantly, working solution to grid instability. It can dispatch enormous loads of power in minutes without requiring any subsidies. It is market driven because Bitcoin miners always search for lower-cost operating facilities. Interestingly, the demand-response industry attracted a lot of attention once it started working correctly at scale. But the hero happened to be a long-hated “villain”: Bitcoin. </p><h2>The Future </h2><p>Energy companies have worked with Bitcoin miners long enough to understand that this industry is here to stay. It is a matter of time until the entire energy industry grows enough hard skin to accept it. Bitcoin mining has flipped from being just a power consumer to a consumer with benefits. The mining companies that will adopt different mining strategies, including optimizing operational costs, partnering with energy providers and finding a way to earn additional revenues using Bitcoin mining as a tool for energy management, will prevail. </p><p>This halving cycle ending in less than a year means that electricity sourcing and power prices will be even more crucial for the long-term success of the Bitcoin mining community. The next era of mining winners will be technologically-adapted companies with versatile toolkits to manage crises on many levels, including technological solutions for updating existing and developing new solutions. </p><p>Winters will come and go, Bitcoin will stay. The question is, who remains along with it?</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Sergii Gerasymovych.
