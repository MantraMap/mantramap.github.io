<p>Prosecutors in the United States charged ex-FTX CEO and founder <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-transferred-assets-to-bahamas-government-after-bankruptcy/">Sam Bankman-Fried</a> with eight criminal counts today, including wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering.<br /><br />The disgraced crypto mogul was arrested yesterday in the Bahamas at the request of US authorities seeking his extradition.<br /><br />Bankman-Fried is charged by the US Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Southern District of New York with conspiracy to commit wire fraud on customers, wire fraud on customers, conspiracy to commit wire fraud on lenders, wire fraud on lenders, conspiracy to commit commodities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and conspiracy to defraud the United States and violate campaign finance laws.<br /><br />In addition, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed a lawsuit against Bankman-Fried today for alleged violations of federal commodities laws.<br /><br /><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ftx-token-trading-volume-jumps-1060-as-price-rises-on-ftx-revival-proposal-supported-by-sam-bankman-fried/">FTX</a> crashed spectacularly last month, in what was by far the sharpest decline in the cryptocurrency industry&#8217;s 13-year history.<br /><br />The company, which allowed customers to buy, sell, and store a variety of digital assets as well as speculate on the future prices of cryptocurrency via derivative products, was one of the most popular in the world.<br /><br />However, it failed when it became clear that the company lacked sufficient funds to back customers&#8217; assets. According to newly appointed FTX CEO John J. Ray III, this was due to Alameda Research, a sister company also founded by Bankman-Fried, having the ability to use FTX customer assets for its purposes without oversight.</p>

<p>After pausing them for a while, Binance is once again processing withdrawal requests for the USD Coin (USDC) stablecoin.</p>
<p>According to Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, the insufficient USDC reserves on the platform caused a temporary halt in the processing of USDC withdrawals at the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange platform by daily volume, Binance.</p>
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/binances-auditor-confirms-bitcoin-reserves-are-101-backed/">Binance</a>, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, announced on Tuesday that withdrawals of the stablecoin USDC will be halted until a token swap involving the asset is completed.<br /><br />This change does not affect other tokens tied to the value of the dollar, such as tether and BUSD, a stablecoin created by Binance and the blockchain-focused company Paxos.<br /><br />The chief executive of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, also stated on <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1602579499903852544">Twitter</a>: <em>&#8220;On USDC, we have seen an increase in withdrawals. However, the channel to swap from PAX/BUSD to USDC calls for using a New York-based bank that deals in USD. For a few more hours, the banks are closed. We expect the situation will be restored when the banks open.&#8221;</em><br /><br />According to blockchain analytics firm<a href="https://twitter.com/nansen_ai/status/1602673823651864577"> Nansen</a>, Binance has seen the highest daily amount of withdrawals since June. On the previous day, there were $3 billion in net outflows. <a href="https://twitter.com/Blockanalia/status/1602337143048781826">Jump Trading</a>, one of the biggest cryptocurrency market makers, was mentioned in a tweet by Nansen analyst Andrew Thurman as one of the biggest redeemers.<br /><br />Investors are uneasy because they fear that the collapse of rival exchange FTX last month will spread to the rest of the industry. Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of FTX, was detained in the Bahamas late on Monday after criminal charges were brought by American prosecutors.<br /><br />In recent weeks, concern has also grown regarding Binance. The exchange released its first proof-of-reserves report, an audit designed to make sure that a platform has enough assets to cover all of its client balances and reassure customers about the security of their holdings.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies, including <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/shib-price-analysis-shiba-inu-price-rebounds-shib-up-for-grabs-as-welly-launches-shiba-eternity-tournament/">Shiba Inu (SHIB)</a>, are attempting to recover from selling pressure brought on at the start of the week. In recent hours, the Shibburn website reported a large SHIB burn transaction. According to the data, a whopping 19,400,000 SHIB was transferred to a dead wallet in a single transaction. According to Etherscan.io, the transaction was completed through one of the Cryptocom-associated wallets labeled <em>&#8220;Crypto.com 2.&#8221;</em> Shiba Inu&#8217;s burn rate has subsequently increased by 107% in the last 24 hours, and the total amount of SHIB tokens burned within this timeframe now stands at 31,019,774. In the last seven days, the Shiba Inu Community has eliminated a massive 90,061,737 SHIB with 44 transactions. Shiba Inu pared some of its intraday losses. At the time of publication, Shiba Inu is currently trading at $0.0000089, a 2.34% decrease from the previous day.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $0.00001518, $0.00001000, $0.00000925<br />Support Levels: $0.00000900, $0.00000800, $0.00000700</p>
<h4>SHIB/USD Daily Chart: Bearish</h4>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/shib-price-analysis-shiba-inu-bulls-await-launch-of-shibaeternity-on-october-1-price-returns-to-crucial-level/">SHIB/USD</a> attempted to climb back up past $0.00000925 and failed on December 12, drifting lower to oscillate beneath the $00000900 mark. Since the declines, SHIB has had a difficult time fending off bearish pressures. The pair has been trading sideways within a predetermined range even though the decline appears to have ended above the support level of $0.00000800.<br /><br />It is noteworthy that the daily relative strength index (RSI) has been making lower turns and moving against the daily moving averages of 50 and 200 since the beginning of the month. It resembles a bearish divergence, which signals that the bulls are out of steam. However, if the pair can establish support near the $0.00000850 mark, the bulls may attempt to push higher.</p>
<h4>SHIB/USD 4-Hour chart: Bearish</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1436" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63499 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SHIBUSD-4-Hour-Dec-13.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SHIBUSD-4-Hour-Dec-13.png 1436w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SHIBUSD-4-Hour-Dec-13-300x144.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SHIBUSD-4-Hour-Dec-13-1024x491.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SHIBUSD-4-Hour-Dec-13-768x368.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SHIBUSD-4-Hour-Dec-13-750x359.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SHIBUSD-4-Hour-Dec-13-1140x546.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1436px) 100vw, 1436px" /><span style="color: #999999">SHIB/USD 4-Hour Chart</span></h6>
<p>Right now, the short-term outlook for SHIB/USD is uncertain. Sellers may continue to hold the upper hand unless the price corrects above the $0.00000900 mark and the 4-hour moving average (MA 50 &amp; MA 200) at $0.00000925. The pair was able to hold its support at $0.00000900 while avoiding the next closest support area at $0.00000800.<br /><br />The buyers&#8217; attempts above $0.00000900 and the sellers&#8217; struggle to push prices lower indicate that things might be looking up. Lacking a more definitive direction signal and with the outlook remaining uncertain, price action is still within a consolidation range above the $0.00000800 low. Although SHIB has received support since the June crash, it&#8217;s now at a crucial zone as it attempts to rediscover its rhythm.</p>

<p><a href="https://learn.bybit.com/glossary/definition-proof-of-reserves-por/">ByBit</a> has joined the ranks of major cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance in making its proof of reserves available to the public. <br /><br />The Dubai-based platform announced the launch of a Merkle Tree-Based Proof-of-Reserve System that will allow users to verify their assets as well as Bybit&#8217;s holdings.<br /><br />According to Bybit, the new feature will also enable verification of the ownership of the exchange&#8217;s wallet and the 1:1 asset holding ratio.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;With the release of the Merkle Tree, Bybit has further demonstrated its robust finances and commitment to full transparency. Users can use their Merkle Leaf code to check that their assets are recorded as liabilities in Bybit’s reserves. They can also verify Bybit’s ownership of the wallets and check that assets are held in a 1:1 ratio&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The action was taken almost a month after Bybit publicly disclosed the addresses of its biggest cryptocurrency wallet amid the upheaval brought on by <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-transferred-assets-to-bahamas-government-after-bankruptcy/">FTX&#8217;s demise</a> and calls for greater transparency within the industry.<br /><br />The wallets had then indicated that more than $1 billion of the exchange&#8217;s assets are in Bitcoin, Tether, Ethereum, and USDC, according to the Dashboard that <a href="https://portfolio.nansen.ai/dashboard/bitdao">Nansen</a> published.<br /><br />Over 85% of Bybit&#8217;s reserves are made up of these five blue-chip investments, and stablecoins account for more than 50% of the total. One of the first exchanges to publish its proof of reserves was Binance, which stated that it had net Bitcoin assets worth 582,485 BTC.<br /><br />Mazars Veritas auditing service confirmed the figure, stating that as of November 22nd, Binance&#8217;s BTC was 101% collateralized.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bank-spain-governor-cryptocurrencies-risks/">Bank of Spain</a> is looking for organizations that want to participate in an experimental program for a wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC). According to a December 5 statement, the bank will focus on three main areas: the program will simulate fund movement, experiment with financial asset liquidation, and assess the benefits and drawbacks of introducing a wholesale CBDC to its current processes and infrastructure. <br /><br />The institution is also seeking the collaboration of industry companies that will be able to develop project proposals. The study, according to the Bank, will help determine how well it can adapt to the &#8220;needs and demands of an increasingly digital society.&#8221;<br /><br />In contrast to a retail<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bank-of-jamaica-successfully-completes-cbdc-pilot/"> CBDC</a>, which is available to the general public, a wholesale CBDC is a digital currency used by a bank to keep reserves at a central bank. The bank also stated that the wholesale CBDC program is unrelated to the European Union&#8217;s current research into a retail digital euro. <br /><br />The Central Bank stated that the goal of its new venture is to determine the viability of using such a currency and to test the benefits that it may have to offer the settlement process.<br /><br />The bank will accept proposals until January 31, 2023, at which point it will begin evaluating each one for potential selection. Selected proposals must be completed in no more than nine months, beginning on April 3, and are expected to be completed by December 29, 2023. However, the bank has stated that an extension may be granted depending on several factors.</p>

<li>BTC investors are hoping for more signs of upward price pressure</li>
<li>BTC/USD has gained about 0.16% in 7 days per <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">CoinMarketCap</a></li>
<li>Bitcoin bulls broke through resistance on the 1st of December</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-btc-quells-downside-move-indicators-and-market-participants-have-this-to-say/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> is under renewed selling pressure near $17,300. A successful higher close would bolster the bull case. BTC investors are hoping for more signs of upward price pressure, which could allow Bitcoin whales around the world to be less aggressive and pro-growth. Since we are still in a bear market, investors may jump back into BTC in hopes of a turnaround resulting in a sudden spike. According to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">CoinMarketCap</a>, BTC/USD has gained about 0.16% in 7 days and is currently consolidating following its recent recovery attempt. The pair is losing 0.33% in 24 hours as seen on its daily chart. At the time of analysis, BTC/USD is trading at $17,108, as Bitcoin bulls broke through resistance on the 1st of December since early November to reclaim the 17,000 round level.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $22,000, $20,000, $17,500<br />Support Levels: $15,500, $12,000, $10,000</p>
<h4>BTC/USD Daily Chart: Bearish</h4>

<p>The <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/btc-price-analysis-btc-usd-might-rise-above-18000-on-extended-year-end-rally/">BTC/USD</a> is currently trading near $17,000, beneath the moving average of 50, and was last seen higher at the $17,271 daily high, after breaking through the $17,000 level. If the market continues to trade in a straight line, the next movement could be the horizontal level at $15,500.<br /><br />Nonetheless, a significant breach of the $17,000 support turned resistance level could be an early indication of a trend reversal and a shift in focus back towards the $20,000 main psychological zone. The $16,000 level, which is the next horizontal support barrier, should keep dips at bay.</p>
<h4>BTC/USD 4-Hour Chart: Ranging</h4>

<p>The BTC/USD intraday bias is still trading in a straight line at the moment The recovery from $15,460 should target $17,500. Meanwhile, a sustained break will result in a shift toward the $20,000 psychological zone. A break of the $15,500 low level will restart a larger downtrend.<br /><br />If the $16,500 minor support level on the downside is broken, the intraday bias will change to bearish and some consolidations will occur. The rebound scenario may be invalidated if the price breaks the downward boundary and settles below $16,000. In this case, the pair may continue to fall toward $15,000.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ethereum (ETH) is marginally up at $1,270 at press time</li>

</ul>
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ethereum-eth-sees-another-bull-favoring-element-as-on-chain-analytics-indicate-increased-blockchain-activity/">Ethereum (ETH)</a> is marginally up at $1,270 at press time. Data from Santiment reveals that Ethereum whales who own between 100 and 1 million ETH added 561,000 ETH worth about $690 million between December 5 and 6. In its insights report, onchain analytics firm Santiment observes that Ethereum&#8217;s key shark and whale addresses paint an interesting picture. Over the past year, just like Bitcoin, millionaire addresses have mainly shed much of their supply while conditions have looked poor. But one month ago, these large ETH addresses began to change their tune for the first time in a long time. Since November 7, Ethereum addresses holding 100 to 1 million coins have accumulated back 1.36% of the overall supply and added 2.09% more overall ETH (than they had previously) to their bags.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $1,700, $1,500, $1,300<br />Support Levels: $1,200, $1,000, $800</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/eth-price-analysis-eth-usd-supported-as-markets-stay-in-the-oversold-territory-after-successful-merge/">ETH/USD</a> softened after the bulls lifted its price toward the daily moving average (MA 50). On the daily chart, the pair has been grinding up along the moving average. For the bears, November’s low of $1,073 may prove to be a tough level to crack. A ranging RSI indicates a slowdown in the upward momentum.<br /><br />An initial break below $1,200 might trigger the first round of profit-taking, turning it into fresh resistance. $1,300 is the immediate level to gauge follow-up bids, and its breach would send the price to $1,500. After hitting as low as $1,071, the $1,000 handle now looks rather vulnerable. In any case, the near-term outlook might stay bearish.</p>

It’s trying to draw support from $1,265 as well as the moving average of 50. There is no clear sign of a rebound yet. On the upside, a break of the $1,300 resistance will indicate short-term bottoming and bring a stronger rise toward the $1,500 horizontal level.<br /><br />However, a break of the 50-day moving average will open up a deeper decline to a $1,200 handle and possibly lower. The next move will depend more on development in the overall crypto market. As long as the $1,200 resistance turned support holds, the anticipated uptrend will resume at a later stage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The year 2022 was a difficult year across the board marked by industry failures as well as falling prices brought on by Fed’s aggressive monetary tightening policies. A vast majority of <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/shib-loses-almost-15b-from-its-market-cap/">crypto assets</a> have underperformed so far in the year.<br /><br />The bulls might try to turn things around with a last-minute end-of-year surge. <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/polkadot-sells-500000-tokens-price-havent-been-specified/">Polkadot (DOT)</a>, Stellar (XLM), and Monero (XMR) appear to be in the midst of an intriguing setup, according to on-chain analytics company Santiment, which could result in price hikes in the near term. <br /><br />While the price of Bitcoin continues to decline, support is slowly developing just below the $17,000 mark. The fluctuating range price action of Bitcoin, however, seems to be motivating traders to follow a few intriguing setups in a few altcoins.<br /><br />Santiment reports that as the weekend has begun, traders are betting against some altcoins to profit from price decreases. Polkadot, Monero, and Stellar all have substantial short positions on exchanges, according to the on-chain analytics company, which means that short positions are predominant. <br /><br />It continues by stating that under such circumstances, price increases and liquidations are more likely to occur. As investors who have bet against these assets are likely to cover their short positions, which can result in what is known as a &#8220;short squeeze,&#8221; crypto assets with a high ratio of short bets are expected to rise in value during market rallies.<br /><br />In contrast to the previous year, when SHIB concluded strong with thousands of percent gains, SHIB is down 75% so far this year. To end the year in the black, SHIB needs to post a climb of about 80% over the next 18 days. At the time of publication, SHIB was up 1.5% at $0.00000932. Also, SHIB remains well correlated with bitcoin- thus keeping an eye on the general market trend might help predict SHIB’s next moves.</p>
<h2>Here Are Bitcoin Predictions</h2>
<p>In a recent tweet, Glassnode revealed that realized losses for <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-holders-moved-over-220-million-from-exchanges-days-after-halving/">Bitcoin holders</a> over the previous 365 days totaled $213 billion. This is in contrast to the $455 billion gained during the bull market from 2020 to 2021. As of the apex of the 2018 bear market cycle, this is comparable to a 47% realized loss on the gains from the previous bull run, according to Glassnode.<br /><br />Notably, this occurred at the same time as the cycle&#8217;s price bottom.<br /><br />Il Capo of Crypto who has recently made several accurate forecasts stated in his most recent tweet on November 28 that he is still confident that Bitcoin will reach $12,000. As a result, the trader has decided to hold off on posting until his bias is established or disproved.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Bitcoin Price has established a range between $17,200 and $16,800 in the interim. Although Bitcoin was going for roughly $17,178 at the time of publication, trading near the upper end of the range.</p>

<p>In the past week, <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/breaking-ripples-reply-to-sec-summary-judgment-motions-made-public-ripple-gc-says-its-proud-of-defense/">Ripple</a> filed its redacted reply to the SEC’s opposition to Ripple’s motion for summary judgment.<br /><br />Ripple general counsel, Stuart Alderoty wrote, <em>&#8220;This is our final submission where we ask the court to grant judgment in our favor. After two long years, Ripple is proud of the defense we’ve mounted on behalf of the entire crypto industry. We have always played it straight with the Court. Can’t say the same for our adversary&#8221;</em><br /><br />Now that the last submission has been made, the judge&#8217;s decision is awaited.<br /><br />Attorney Jeremy Hogan, Partner at the law firm of Hogan &amp; Hogan, predicts how the case might turn out. Attorney Hogan stated today in a YouTube video that Ripple had a 50.12% chance of triumphing in its legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission. <br /><br />He noted that the likelihood of Judge Torres ruling in favor of the SEC is 29.88%. He claimed, however, that Ripple might also post a marginal win in this situation if the SEC is determined to be the victor.<br /><br />Hogan further predicts that there is a 19.11% possibility that the case will result in a tie for both the SEC and Ripple with a trial set for the summer of 2023.<br /><br />It is believed that the absence of clear laws in the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/g20-take-baby-steps-regulate-cryptocurrencies/">U.S. crypto business</a> has hampered its development. Leading industry figures, including the CEO of Ripple, have urged the SEC to establish clear regulations so that the American crypto economy can flourish.<br /><br />Recall that Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse blasted the SEC for advocating regulation by enforcement rather than going through the arduous process of creating &#8220;a new set of crypto regulations&#8221; during the 2022 Collision Conference in Toronto.</p>
<h2>Parties Seek New Deadline in Lawsuit</h2>
<p>As all the briefings for summary judgment motions are now completed, what remains pending now is the sealing issues.<br /><br />According to an earlier timeline in the lawsuit, The date to file omnibus motions to seal all proposed redactions to all summary judgment materials was expected to be December 22.<br /><br />Now, parties are requesting the Court set a deadline of January 4, 2023, by which non-parties(that is neither SEC nor Ripple) must ask to seal any portions of the summary judgment materials.</p>

<p>The<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/eth-price-analysis-eth-usd-sets-for-october-breakout-on-post-ethereum-merge-activities/"> Ethereum merge</a> in mid-September has been over for almost three months. In conclusion, traders are unsure of how to evaluate the second-largest crypto asset by market cap. On the one hand, the important whale accumulation is showing promise. However, the utility and real on-chain activity continue to be underwhelming.<br /><br />Whether the potential for a price rebound&#8230; Onchain metrics forecast what to expect in terms of ETH pricing, including whether sub-$1,000 ETH might once again be a possibility.</p>
<h2>Here Is What Onchain Metrics Suggest</h2>
<p>The major shark and whale addresses for Ethereum are reportedly creating an intriguing picture, according to onchain analytics company Santiment. Millionaire addresses have primarily lost a sizable portion of their supply during the previous year, much like Bitcoin when things appeared bleak.<br /><br />However, huge <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/eth-price-analysis-major-move-lies-in-wait-as-large-ethereum-addresses-add-561000-eth-to-accumulation-spree/">ETH addresses</a> started to change their tune for the first time in a while one month ago. Since November 7th, Ethereum addresses holding 100 to 1 million coins have amassed 1.36% of the total supply and 2.09% more total ETH (than they had previously) in their bags. This surge in large address interest in ETH again makes this measure an optimistic one.<br /><br />Like other assets, the amount of conversation about Ethereum has also decreased as time has passed since its record-breaking peak in November 2021. This is a natural evolution of weak hands leaving crypto in general, so it&#8217;s not necessarily a bad thing.<br /><br />However, what is interesting is seeing Ethereum talked about so little relative to other top assets. Since December 2020, the amount of discourse about ETH in relation to the top 100 crypto assets has dropped to its lowest level in late October. This suggests that the second-ranked cryptocurrency asset is currently flying somewhat under the radar.<br /><br />This indicator is optimistic since the lack of interest after the merge suggests that whales, as previously noted, might drive prices up with little pushback.<br /><br />Third, there is still a lot of pain, as indicated by the long-term (365d) addresses&#8217; average return over the past year. Prior to a sharp drop in value 13 months ago, Ethereum prices were just shy of $5,000. Many folks still have percentage losses of -50% or higher on their ETH investments.<br /><br />As long as the 365-day trading returns are at -25% or more (and it&#8217;s currently at -30%), then there is a cap on how much further downside there can be, based on seven years of ETH history.<br /><br />On the other hand, mid-term traders could still see prices moving either way. Late November is when prices bottomed out, and the asset is actually +17% since November 22nd. To many, it certainly doesn&#8217;t feel this way, however. <br /><br />Because of the long-term upside indicated by MVRV, this metric points to bullishness. At the time of publication, ETH was changing hands at $1264, down 1.69% in the last 24 hours.</p>
