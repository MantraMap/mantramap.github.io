										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.immunify.life/">Immunify.Life</a> is thrilled to announce its initial token listing on <a href="https://quickswap.exchange/#/">Quickswap</a>, one of the leading decentralised exchanges in the blockchain space.</p>
<p>The launch is slated to take place on July 22nd at 1 pm UTC, representing a crucial step in the project&#8217;s journey and providing it significant exposure and liquidity.</p>
<h4>Introducing Immunify.Life</h4>
<p>Immunify is the cutting-edge, blockchain-powered healthcare platform that allows patients, medical practitioners, and researchers to interact, share data, and manage health outcomes in a secure, compliant, and efficient manner. The platform offers an integrated solution for storing health records, managing disease registries, facilitating medical studies, and much more.</p>
<h4>Challenges in the Current Healthcare Landscape</h4>
<p>Immunify stands out in the healthcare industry through its unique focus on data security, interoperability, and patient-centric care. Current healthcare models are often marred by fragmented data, limited accessibility, and insufficient patient control over personal health records. Immunify addresses these challenges head-on, introducing a paradigm shift in how healthcare is managed and delivered.</p>
<p>Use cases include the creation of digital disease registries, facilitating groundbreaking medical studies, and improving access to comprehensive and up-to-date health records for millions of patients across the globe.</p>
<h4>$IMM Token Utility</h4>
<p>To realise its ambitions, Immunify has tokenised participation and incentives in its ecosystem through the $IMM token. The $IMM token creates an inclusive marketplace for health data and services, where patients and healthcare professionals earn tokens for their engagement and contribution. This incentivises active participation in the ecosystem while simultaneously solving the accessibility and data silo issues inherent in traditional healthcare systems.</p>
<p>Immunify&#8217;s unique approach to leveraging blockchain and AI technologies in healthcare has already gained significant interest from healthcare providers, with several key partnerships in place.</p>
<h4>Why Immunify.Life Chose Quickswap for its Token Listing</h4>
<p>Immunify’s decision to list its token on Quickswap marks a crucial step for the platform, as it gains access to a reputable decentralised exchange with a global user base. Quickswap is dedicated to providing safe and secure trading services, in addition to a suite of resources to help users make informed trading decisions.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is now <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/sec-sues-coinbase-as-feds-crack-down-on-cryptocurrency-companies/ar-AA1ccuO7">going after popular North American</a> crypto exchange Coinbase in a court of law. As if attacking Binance (as we <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sec-sues-binance-alleges-selling-of-illegal-securities/">reported earlier</a>) wasn’t enough, the financial agency is looking to add another large firm to its victims list.</p>
<h2>The SEC Sues Coinbase</h2>
<p>Allegations against Coinbase suggest that the firm operated an illegal and unregistered exchange for the past several years (the company has been around since 2012). The move is clearly a continuation of the Wells notice that <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-receives-wells-notice-from-the-sec/">Coinbase received last April</a>. The notice said that while Coinbase wasn’t being charged with anything yet, it could expect charges in the future.</p>
<p>This was something executives took issue with, as they claimed they met with representatives of the SEC multiple times over the span of nine years to ensure they were always in compliance with present financial rules. Gary Gensler – the head of the SEC – said in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>We allege that Coinbase, despite being subject to the securities laws, commingled and unlawfully offered exchange, broker-dealer, and clearinghouse functions. Coinbase&#8217;s alleged failures deprive investors of critical protections including rulebooks that prevent fraud and manipulation, proper disclosure, safeguards against conflicts of interest, and routine inspection by the SEC.</p></blockquote>
<p>The agency feels Coinbase has been offering the same services as an exchange, broker, and clearing agency, and thus since the year 2019, it’s been out of compliance as it was required to formally register with the SEC and undergo the necessary protocols. The statement from Gensler continued with:</p>
<blockquote><p>By collapsing these functions into a single platform and failing to register with the SEC as to any of the three functions, and not having qualified for any applicable exemptions from registration, Coinbase has for years defied the regulatory structures and evaded the disclosure requirements that Congress, and the SEC have constructed for the protection of the national securities markets and investors.</p></blockquote>
<p>Gurbir S. Grewal – director of the SEC’s division of enforcement – said that companies like Coinbase are not above the law and are not exempt from following the rules. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>You simply can&#8217;t ignore the rules because you don&#8217;t like them or because you&#8217;d prefer different ones. The consequences for the investing public are far too great. As alleged in our complaint, Coinbase was fully aware of the applicability of the federal securities laws to its business activities, but deliberately refused to follow them.</p></blockquote>
<h2>We Didn&#8217;t Do Anything!</h2>
<p>Naturally, the trading platform is firing back and said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The SEC&#8217;s reliance on an enforcement-only approach in the absence of clear rules for the digital asset industry is hurting America&#8217;s economic competitiveness and companies like Coinbase that have a demonstrated commitment to compliance. The solution is legislation that allows fair rules for the road to be developed transparently and applied equally.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has made it very clear it doesn’t care if a crypto company is big or small. It will go after any digital currency enterprise with a persecuting hand, as it demonstrated yet again last month when it <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/sec-sues-binance-alleging-it-operated-an-illegal-exchange/ar-AA1ca06y?OCID=ansmsnnews11">announced plans to sue</a> Binance, the largest and most popular digital currency exchange in the world.</p>
<h2>The SEC and Binance Go Head to Head</h2>
<p>The news caused bitcoin and Ethereum to drop to their lowest points in just over two months, with BTC – the world’s largest digital currency by market cap – falling into the mid-$25K range. That’s a loss of about $2,000 over the past few weeks alone.</p>
<p>The SEC alleges that Binance operated an illegal exchange for years and sold securities without going through the proper registration processes. In addition, the company is also facing allegations that it commingled customer funds with company revenue. If this is true, then Binance clearly took a page out of the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/">FTX playbook</a>.</p>
<p>The now dead trading platform is facing similar charges, as its former founder Sam Bankman-Fried has been accused of mixing customer and company funds and using client money to pay off loans and invest in real estate. The lawsuit from the SEC says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Defendants&#8217; purposeful efforts to evade U.S. regulatory oversight while simultaneously providing securities-related services to U.S. customers put the safety of billions of dollars of U.S. investor capital at risk and at Binance&#8217;s and Zhao&#8217;s mercy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Binance has been sitting in the hot seat for some time. Not long ago, the exchange was also sued by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/cftc-sues-binance-alleging-financial-violations/">which alleged that the</a> trading platform had, for years, violated the Commodity Exchange Act. In a statement, CFTC chair Rostin Behnam claimed:</p>
<blockquote><p>For years, Binance knew they were violating CFTC rules, working actively to both keep the money flowing and avoid compliance. This should be a warning to anyone in the digital asset world that the CFTC will not tolerate willful avoidance of U.S. law.</p></blockquote>
<h2>The Company Says It Did No Wrong</h2>
<p>Representatives of Binance expressed their disappointment with the decision and said that because of the company’s size and power in the industry, they are an easy target for financial agencies looking to make names for themselves. They said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are disappointed that the SEC chose to file a complaint today against Binance seeking, among other remedies, purported emergency relief. We now join [several] other crypto projects facing similarly misguided actions from the SEC, and we will vigorously defend our business and the industry… Because of our size and global name recognition, Binance has found itself an easy target caught in the middle of a U.S. regulatory tug-of-war.</p></blockquote>
<p>The SEC has been on a rampage for some time, and has been looking to take out major crypto firms including <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/is-the-sec-trying-to-kill-crypto-for-good/">Kraken</a> and <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-receives-wells-notice-from-the-sec/">Coinbase</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jack Dorsey – the former head of Twitter – has put out a video <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jack-dorsey-endorses-fellow-bitcoin-001943733.html">suggesting he’s endorsing</a> bitcoin-loving presidential candidate Robert Kennedy Jr. to assume nation-leading duties in the White House in 2025.</p>
<h2>Jack Dorsey is Pushing Robert Kennedy Jr.</h2>
<p>Not long ago, Dorsey put out a video on social media about the candidate and commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>Robert. F. Kennedy, Jr. argues he can beat Trump and DeSantis in 2024. He can and will.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kennedy entered the presidential race a few months back and is working hard to garner the democratic nomination in 2024 and thus remove current democrat commander-in-chief Joe Biden from the ticket altogether. Kennedy has repeatedly <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/presidential-hopeful-robert-kennedy-jr-appeared-at-this-years-miami-btc-conference/">initiated comments about bitcoin</a> and crypto use and even made an appearance at this year’s Miami Bitcoin Conference where he stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>As president, I will make sure that your right to hold and use bitcoin is inviolable. You should be able to own your own private keys, the same as you own the keys to your car or own your wallet…I don’t think the government has the right to demand access to your bitcoin key or indeed any of your passwords. To say otherwise [is] to cede essential territory to [a] surveillance state.</p></blockquote>
<p>When a commenter on Twitter said there was no way Kennedy would be nominated due to likely interference from the Democratic National Committee (DNC), Dorsey responded with, “Even more reason.” He was also quick to add that the DNC is losing relevance and that its present state marks the “end of an empire.”</p>
<p>It makes sense Dorsey would be such an advocate for Kennedy. Dorsey has long been a major bitcoin fan, commenting in the year <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/21/jack-dorsey-expects-bitcoin-to-become-the-worlds-single-currency-in-about-10-years.html#:~:text=Twitter%20and%20Square%20CEO%20Jack%20Dorsey%20predicts%20bitcoin,bitcoin%2C%E2%80%9D%20Dorsey%20said%20in%20a%20report%20published%20Wednesday.">2018 that the currency</a> would ultimately become the world’s sole form of money. Thus, if Kennedy is pro bitcoin, it seems only natural that Dorsey would fall in line behind him.</p>
<p>At the same time, Dorsey needs to remain realistic about Kennedy’s chances. Right now, polls are showing that while Kennedy has <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/pro-bitcoin-candidate-robert-kennedy-093706291.html">about 20 percent of the</a> democratic vote, he is still miles behind Biden, who presently holds 60 percent, and Biden has been slipping <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/05/07/biden-polling-approval-rating-trump-00095699">heavily in the polls</a> as of late.</p>
<h2>Trump is Still the Frontrunner</h2>
<p>Thus, the idea that this man could even come near someone like Donald Trump – who <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meetthepressblog/new-polls-show-trump-commanding-lead-2024-gop-race-rcna86232">is not only leading</a> by triple digits in republican polls, but is also leading <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4012722-trump-beats-biden-by-7-points-in-hypothetical-2024-matchup-poll/">Biden by several points</a> – is a tad ludicrous if not completely farfetched.</p>
<p>Right now, Trump is the true frontrunner for the White House in 2024, likely due to his past track record and performance as president. Biden has done so much damage in the last 2.5 years that many Americans probably don’t want to take too many chances and prefer a candidate with a solid history and a proven ability to turn things around quickly under his belt.</p>

<li>The price is now trading below the $255 zone and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $250 on the 4-hour chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair could continue to move down if it stays below the $265 resistance zone.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Bitcoin cash price is declining below the $255 zone against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-could-regain-strength-above-this-hurdle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a>. BCH/USD could extend losses if there is a close below $232.</em></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis</h2>
<p>Bitcoin cash price struggled to gain pace for a move above the $295 and $300 resistance levels. BCH formed a high near $295 and started a fresh decline.</p>
<p>There was a clear move below the $285 and $265 support levels. The pair even declined below the $250 support. It tested the $232 zone. A low is formed near $231.61 and the price is now consolidating losses. It is now trading near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $295.00 swing high to the $231.61 low.</p>
<p>Besides, it is trading below the $250 zone and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-cash-analysis-bulls-aim-for-fresh-rally-to-350/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. Immediate resistance is near the $249.50 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $250 on the 4-hour chart of the BCH/USD pair.</p>
<p>The next key resistance is near $265 and the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $295.00 swing high to the $231.61 low. Any more gains above $115 could set the pace for a move toward the $280 level.</p>
<p>If there is a move above the $280 resistance, the price could rise toward the $295 zone. If not, the price might continue lower below $240. Immediate support on the downside is near the $235 zone. The next major support is near the $232 level, below which the bears might aim for $220.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PARIS] – July 17, 2023 –</strong> During ETHCC23, <a href="https://neonevm.org/"><strong>Neon EVM</strong></a> launched on the Solana Mainnet to help close the gap between the different programming, computing, and memory models of Ethereum and Solana, bringing a low-friction solution to allow EVM dApps to settle to Solana.</p>
<p>The Neon EVM program is a smart contract on the Solana blockchain. It accepts wrapped Ethereum-like transactions and processes them on Solana.</p>
<p>Previously, when EVM dApps wanted to leverage low-cost solutions, they had to use a rollup or sidechain. By using Solana as the settlement layer, an EVM is well-placed to outcompete such L2 solutions. The average transaction fee for sending ETH on the Ethereum network is ~$2. The L2s offer between <a href="https://l2fees.info/">$0.5–$0.1</a>, a saving of 4–20 times. In comparison, Solana’s average transaction fees are ~0.00001 SOL ($0.0002) per transaction, 10,000 times saving. Initial tests of Neon EVM in Devnet demonstrate that the protocol <a href="https://medium.com/neon-labs/neon-synthetic-load-test-report-d53212711556">translates these optimizations in practice</a>.</p>
<p>“We are very excited to see Neon EVM live on Solana Mainnet,” says <strong>Marina Guryeva, Director of Neon Foundation</strong>. “Once we repeat these tests in production, we will present the figures based on the real-world data.”</p>
<p>With the launch of Neon EVM on the Solana Mainnet, the Neon DAO is activated to begin participating in, and influencing the future development of, Neon EVM.</p>
<p><strong>About Neon EVM</strong></p>
<p>Neon EVM is an Ethereum Virtual Machine operating as a smart contract on Solana. It gives developers the power to directly deploy Ethereum dApps with minimal reconfiguration to the code, while benefiting from Solana&#8217;s technical advantages. It is built with security, decentralization, and sustainability as core tenants.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new crypto bill designed to at least create a basic <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/06/03/congress-introduces-a-game-changing-crypto-bill-amid-bitcoin-ethereum-bnb-and-xrp-price-pump/?sh=204ce1ce3cbb">framework for crypto regulation</a> in the United States has been submitted to Congress for review and subsequent approval.</p>
<h2>Is Regulation in the U.S. Getting Stronger?</h2>
<p>The 162-page draft bill was introduced by House Financial Services Committee chair Patrick McHenry, a republican from North Carolina, and House Agriculture Committee chair Glenn Thompson, a republican from Pennsylvania (leave it to the republicans to take the lead in getting things done).</p>
<p>The U.S. has really fallen behind in many ways when it comes to crypto regulation. Not long ago, the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-eu-is-implementing-new-crypto-regulations/">European Union</a> (EU) and <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-united-kingdom-announces-plans-for-new-crypto-regulations/">the UK</a> introduced new crypto legislation designed to not only keep investors safe, but also ensure blockchain and crypto firms stayed in line. By contrast, while the U.S. has spoken about crypto regulation for some time, the nation has done little to nothing to get it implemented.</p>
<p>This has led to several issues in that right now, in the nation, agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have little to go on and are thus operating in a very persecuting way. These agencies are simply going after crypto companies and <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/is-the-sec-trying-to-kill-crypto-for-good/">inflicting penalties wherever</a> possible, though everyone knows this is not the strategy you use to get firms to fall in line.</p>
<p>Several companies – including Coinbase – <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-is-now-active-in-bermuda/">have even left</a> the U.S. or opened separate divisions in international territory as a means of avoiding ongoing crypto regulation confusion in America.</p>
<p>The bill seeks to ensure that the boundaries of both the SEC and the CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission) are set in stone. It makes it clear which arenas are controlled or overseen by which, and the other cannot step into territory dominated or monitored by the other.</p>
<p>The bill leaves a lot of room open for improvement, though for the most part, bitcoin and crypto advocates are lauding the bill as a solid step forward for the industry. Paul Grewal – chief legal officer at bitcoin and crypto exchange Coinbase – commented on Twitter:</p>
<blockquote><p>A comprehensive bill of this magnitude warrants an in-depth review, which we’ll be conducting over the coming days, but what we’re seeing so far is encouraging.</p></blockquote>
<h2>This is a Gamechanger</h2>
<p>This sentiment was echoed by Ryann Selkis, founder at crypto data company Messari. He wrote online:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s a win this year for crypto to even get some attention in DC right now after last year&#8217;s setbacks. There is still a lot of work to do to get to a viable piece of legislation, but this is a good starting point for a sensible market structure bill.</p></blockquote>
<p>Over the last eight months, the U.S. has faced increasing pressure to input the appropriate crypto-related laws into its legal system due to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/">the FTX collapse</a> of eight months ago.</p>
