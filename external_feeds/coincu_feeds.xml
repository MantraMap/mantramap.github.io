<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>DeSo offers $1 million bounties for developers to create Reddit alternatives on its blockchain.</em></li>



<li><em>The social blockchain aims to provide decentralized content control and combat censorship.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>DeSo, the social blockchain platform, is offering an enticing opportunity for developers by providing bounties of up to $1 million.&nbsp;</strong></h5>

<p>The rewards are aimed at those who can create alternatives to the Reddit chain on DeSo&#8217;s platform. This initiative comes as a response to Reddit&#8217;s recent decision to restrict API access, leading to discontent within the community due to limited access to content.</p>



<p>DeSo believes that building a decentralized version of Reddit on its blockchain will grant users complete control over their content, free from censorship or the risk of being banned at the protocol level. By leveraging the capabilities of blockchain technology, the firm aims to empower users with greater freedom and ownership over their social media experiences.</p>



<p>The announcement of the bounty program comes on the heels of the platform successful financing round in 2021, which secured a substantial $200 million in funding. Prominent investors, including a16z and Sequoia Capital, participated in the financing, highlighting the growing interest and support for DeSo&#8217;s innovative blockchain-based social platform.</p>

<p>Developers who participate in the bounty program have the opportunity to contribute to the creation of a <a href="https://coincu.com/193278-lens-protocol-raises-15-million/">decentralized</a> Reddit alternative, providing users with a robust and censorship-resistant social media experience. The bounties serve as incentives for developers to harness their skills and creativity, as well as to fuel the growth and development of the DeSo ecosystem.</p>



<p>By encouraging developers to build on its platform, DeSo aims to foster innovation and expand the possibilities of social blockchain technology. With the potential to revolutionize the way we engage and interact on social media, DeSo&#8217;s bounty program represents a significant step towards creating a more decentralized and user-centric social media landscape.</p>



<p>As DeSo continues to gain traction and support from investors, it remains at the forefront of the social blockchain revolution, offering an alternative path to social media that prioritizes user control and content ownership.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Crypto attacks rose by 65.3% in Q2 2023, while the total damage decreased by 60.4%.</em></li>



<li><em>Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum were the main targets of the attacks, with hacking being the most common method.</em></li>



<li><em>The North Korean hacker group Lazarus was responsible for almost half of the illegal attacks.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In the second quarter of 2023, the cryptocurrency and decentralized finance (DeFi) sectors witnessed a significant increase in the number of attacks, according to a <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/t3wqy70tc3bv/zgX5ZJPLIiJgPDngenEsQ/209d1fb848f9bcbe5d41a0da3b4eeff1/Immunefi_Crypto_Losses_in_Q2_2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> by Immunefi. Despite a rise in the number of incidents, the scale of damage caused by these crypto attacks decreased compared to the same period last year.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-431.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="400" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-431.png" alt="Crypto Attacks Surged In Q2, But The Scale Of Damage Decreased: Report" class="wp-image-200735" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-431.png 800w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-431-300x150.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-431-768x384.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-431-360x180.png 360w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-431-750x375.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" title="Crypto Attacks Surged In Q2, But The Scale Of Damage Decreased: Report 3"></a></figure></div>


<p>Immunefi&#8217;s analysis revealed that the number of <a href="https://coincu.com/164099-crypto-attacks-cause-3-8-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crypto attacks</a>, including hacking incidents, rose by 65.3% from 49 to 81 cases in Q2 2023, compared to the same period in 2022. However, the total funds stolen during these attacks decreased by 60.4% in Q2 2023, indicating improved security measures within the industry.</p>



<p>The report estimated that nearly half of the illegal attacks, approximately 49.7%, were attributed to the notorious North Korean hacker group known as Lazarus. Hacking attacks accounted for 83.1% of the damages caused in Q2, with fraud, scams, and rug pulls accounting for the remaining portion.</p>



<p>In terms of targets, the Binance Smart Chain (BNB) and Ethereum were the primary targets for these attacks. The BNB chain accounted for 44.4% of the total damages, while Ethereum accounted for 32.1%.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-433.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="667" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-433.png" alt="Crypto Attacks Surged In Q2, But The Scale Of Damage Decreased: Report" class="wp-image-200738" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-433.png 1000w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-433-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-433-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-433-750x500.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" title="Crypto Attacks Surged In Q2, But The Scale Of Damage Decreased: Report 4"></a></figure></div>


<p>Despite the decrease in stolen funds, the overall damage to the cryptocurrency industry in Q2 2023 amounted to approximately $265.5 million. It is worth noting that only a small portion, $10.5 million, was recovered, representing just 3.9% of the total damages.</p>



<p>Additionally, the report highlighted a concerning trend regarding targeted attacks on blockchain networks. Arbitrum, which had no incidents in Q2 2022, experienced a significant rise in attacks, with 10 major incidents in Q2 2023. This places Arbitrum as the third most targeted blockchain for two consecutive quarters, with a total of 18 incidents recorded year-to-date. Other notable blockchain platforms, such as Polygon and zkSync, also experienced multiple incidents during the quarter.</p>

<p>The increase in crypto attacks underscores the ongoing need for robust security measures and vigilance within the industry to safeguard digital assets and protect users from potential threats.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest, believes that BlackRock does not have an advantage over ARK Invest in the application of a Bitcoin spot ETF.</em></li>



<li><em>Wood suggests that if the US SEC loses the &#8220;Grayscale v. SEC&#8221; case, the chances of approving a Bitcoin spot ETF would increase.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood spoke to Fortune magazine about a Bitcoin spot ETF filing and SEC approval.&nbsp;</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/timthumb-1.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="315" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/timthumb-1.jpeg" alt="Cathie Wood Bullish: US SEC Ruling Impact on Bitcoin Spot ETF" class="wp-image-200725" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/timthumb-1.jpeg 600w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/timthumb-1-300x158.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" title="Cathie Wood Bullish: US SEC Ruling Impact on Bitcoin Spot ETF 6"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In an interview with Fortune magazine, Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest, expressed her perspective on the application of a Bitcoin spot ETF and its potential approval by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Wood believes that BlackRock does not hold an advantage over ARK Invest in this regard, stating that any necessary revisions to their application profile can be made swiftly.</p>



<p>Wood highlighted that while BlackRock&#8217;s application includes a supervisory sharing clause, ARK Invest can easily adjust their application to align with industry standards. Wood emphasized that multiple institutions are moving towards this direction and have submitted their respective applications. The SEC is expected to review ARK Invest&#8217;s application by mid-January next year, while BlackRock&#8217;s review is anticipated before March next year.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2332705_720x360.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="720" height="360" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2332705_720x360.jpeg" alt="Cathie Wood Bullish: US SEC Ruling Impact on Bitcoin Spot ETF" class="wp-image-200726" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2332705_720x360.jpeg 720w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2332705_720x360-300x150.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2332705_720x360-360x180.jpeg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" title="Cathie Wood Bullish: US SEC Ruling Impact on Bitcoin Spot ETF 7"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Cathie Wood pointed out that the SEC has already approved some Bitcoin futures ETFs and recently granted approval for a leveraged Bitcoin futures ETF. However, she believes that spot ETFs, such as the grayscale version, offer greater security as they are fully backed by bitcoins stored in cold wallets, in contrast to futures that involve swaps. Wood finds the SEC&#8217;s approval situation contradictory, with futures ETFs being approved while spot ETFs are rejected.</p>



<p>Moreover, <a href="https://coincu.com/193117-cathie-wood-binances-troubles-help-coinbase/">Wood</a> stated that if the SEC were to lose the ongoing &#8220;Grayscale v. SEC&#8221; case, the likelihood of approving a Bitcoin spot ETF would increase. This case outcome could potentially shape the SEC&#8217;s stance on spot ETFs and pave the way for their approval.</p>



<p>As the regulatory landscape evolves, investors and industry players eagerly await the SEC&#8217;s decisions on Bitcoin spot ETFs, which could have significant implications for the cryptocurrency market and investment opportunities.</p>

<p>In a recent Federal Reserve Bank of New York test, some of the world&#8217;s largest banks, including Citigroup and Wells Fargo, participated in a 12-week trial using a regulated liability network technology. This technology allows banks to simulate issuing digital money representing their customers&#8217; funds before settling through central bank reserves on a distributed ledger. The test proved that digital dollars can improve wholesale payments without altering the legal treatment of the deposits.</p>



<p>Unlike public blockchains commonly seen in cryptocurrencies, the test was conducted on a private blockchain that requires permission to participate. The project concluded that there were no significant legal impediments under existing US laws that would prevent the establishment of a digital dollar. However, further engagement with regulators would be required before reaching a final conclusion.</p>



<p>A central bank digital currency is not yet a reality in the US, but bank deposit tokens issued on a blockchain could be more widely used than stablecoins. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. has said they see promise in deposit tokens. Meanwhile, some officials at the Federal Reserve have expressed doubt over the need for a central bank digital currency.</p>



<p>The New York Innovation Center emphasized that the proof-of-concept was not intended to signal that the Federal Reserve will make any imminent decisions about the appropriateness of issuing a central bank digital currency or any other product or service. The project aimed to explore the potential functional benefits of central bank and commercial bank digital money operating together on a shared ledger.</p>



<p>The pilot found that the technology could help synchronize dollar-denominated payments and facilitate settlement in near-real time. This could greatly benefit cross-border settlements, which are often lengthy and cumbersome due to the many different systems banks and governments use worldwide.</p>

<p>This innovative service enables developers to seamlessly embed web3 wallets into their applications, providing users with a user-friendly design and enhanced accessibility to NFTs, cryptocurrencies, and other web3 digital assets.</p>



<p>The platform offers developers the convenience of building with familiar REST APIs and iOS and Android SDKs, streamlining the deployment and management of users&#8217; wallets and transactions. What sets this service apart is its blockchain-agnostic nature, allowing developers to build once and utilize it across multiple blockchains without requiring blockchain-specific code. Currently, it supports Ethereum, Polygon, and Avalanche, with plans to expand support to other chains in the future.</p>

<p>With flexible custody options, developers can offer either user-custodied or developer-custodied wallets, providing a frictionless Web2 user experience while abstracting the complexities of blockchains for users. The platform also provides robust operations monitoring features, empowering developers to troubleshoot their apps and support users effectively. It offers built-in transaction logs, user-level monitoring, and error reporting, ensuring scalability and reliability as user bases grow.</p>



<p>Circle&#8217;s wallet-as-a-service developer platform is designed to facilitate instant access, allowing developers to sign up with an email address and start building immediately. The platform adopts a pay-as-you-go pricing model, starting at affordable rates and decreasing as volume increases. While users currently self-custody their private keys, Circle plans to introduce updates that will grant developers control over user private keys in the future.</p>

<p>The Circle wallet-as-a-service platform is currently in beta testing, heralding a new era of seamless integration of web3 technologies and empowering developers to deliver enhanced digital asset experiences to users worldwide.</p>



<p>After the introduction of Japan&#8217;s amended Payment Services Act, Circle&#8217;s CEO, Jeremy Allaire, has <a href="https://coincu.com/200440-circle-issuing-stablecoin-in-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shown</a> interest in releasing the company&#8217;s USDC stablecoin in the country. This legislation permits the issuing of stablecoins as electronic payment methods, providing new chances for firms like Circle to extend their presence in the Japanese market.</p>

<p>This move comes as the company aims to expand its operations in HPC data centers and utilize Nvidia&#8217;s high-performance GPU chips for artificial intelligence (AI) applications.</p>



<p>The rebranding reflects HIVE&#8217;s commitment to harnessing the potential of its green energy data centers and GPU Cloud computing technology in the growing AI, machine learning, and advanced data analysis sectors. HIVE has been a prominent player in the cryptocurrency mining industry since 2017.</p>



<p>The name change, which is set to take effect on or around July 12, 2023, will not impact the company&#8217;s trading symbols or share structure. HIVE&#8217;s shares will continue to trade on the TSX Venture Exchange (TSXV) and Nasdaq under the existing symbols.</p>

<p>In addition to the rebranding announcement, the company made a correction to its previous news release, stating that the number of Bitcoin equivalents mined during the year was understated by 792. The corrected figure stands at 4,295 Bitcoin equivalent, including digital assets mined from GPUs.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the company granted 620,000 incentive stock options to employees, officers, and consultants. These stock options, exercisable at C$6.86 per share, are subject to certain vesting requirements.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Key Points:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>Namibia&#8217;s National Assembly approves measures to regulate digital assets and service providers.</em></li>



<li><em>The legislation focuses on licensing, consumer protection, and risk mitigation.</em></li>



<li><em>The Bank of Namibia maintains cryptocurrencies are not legal tender in the country.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Namibia&#8217;s National Assembly has <a href="https://www.parliament.na/b12-2023-virtual-assets-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adopted</a> a bill to regulate domestic digital assets, cryptocurrencies, and digital asset service providers.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-418.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="716" height="425" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-418.png" alt="Namibia Now Legalizes Crypto And Digital Asset" class="wp-image-200694" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-418.png 716w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-418-300x178.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 716px) 100vw, 716px" title="Namibia Now Legalizes Crypto And Digital Asset 14"></a></figure></div>


<p>The legislation&#8217;s goal is to provide a framework for licensing and regulating virtual asset service providers (VASPs). It also intends to appoint a regulator to regulate these providers and their actions. Important goals include consumer protection, limiting market misuse, and lowering the danger of money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation in the virtual asset market. Before it can be implemented, the measure must first be officially published.</p>



<p>Importantly, the Bank of Namibia (BON) maintains that cryptocurrencies are not legal cash in the nation.</p>



<p>The measure is now awaiting formal publication before going into effect. Namibia&#8217;s Minister of Finance and Public Enterprises, Iipumbu Shiimi, indicated in his report the formation of a regulatory agency to regulate and give licenses to VASPs in the nation.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-419.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="960" height="540" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-419.png" alt="Namibia Now Legalizes Crypto And Digital Asset" class="wp-image-200695" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-419.png 960w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-419-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-419-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-419-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" title="Namibia Now Legalizes Crypto And Digital Asset 15"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Namibia’s first Bitcoin automated teller machine (ATM)</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Noncompliant providers might face fines of up to ten million Namibian dollars and a ten-year jail sentence.</p>



<p>Kazembire Zemburuka, the BON&#8217;s director of strategic communications and international relations, stated the bank&#8217;s position in the report, indicating that once the associated risks of innovations like virtual assets are better managed, the bank will assess and decide whether to accept them into the financial system.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-420.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="728" height="479" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-420.png" alt="Namibia Now Legalizes Crypto And Digital Asset" class="wp-image-200696" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-420.png 728w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-420-300x197.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" title="Namibia Now Legalizes Crypto And Digital Asset 16"></a></figure></div>


<p>The execution of a bill to legitimize digital assets by the parliament seems to contradict the BON&#8217;s declaration at the end of 2022. BON, in particular, feels that cryptocurrencies are not recognized as legal money in this nation. On the other hand, the bank has said that it would not prohibit companies and merchants from taking cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>Although the bill&#8217;s approval by the Namibian parliament was lauded as a move in the right direction, other experts emphasized that its implementation should not create needless barriers to innovation.</p>

<p>Bakkt, the digital asset platform, has revealed plans to expand its operations to Hong Kong, the United Kingdom (UK), and the European Union (EU) in an effort to capitalize on regions with more regulatory clarity in the cryptocurrency space. According to Bakkt CEO Gavin Michael, the lack of a clear regulatory framework in the United States has prompted the company to focus on international expansion.</p>



<p>The decision to target Hong Kong, UK, and EU stems from the fact that these regions have made significant progress in establishing cryptocurrency regulations, surpassing the regulatory developments in the US. Michael highlighted the UK&#8217;s commitment to clear crypto regulations, Hong Kong&#8217;s allowance of trading in select cryptocurrencies, and the EU&#8217;s passage of the MiCA framework for crypto regulation.</p>

<p><a href="https://coincu.com/187027-bakkt-delists-25-tokens-including-aave-link/">Bakkt</a> is keen on leveraging Bitcoin&#8217;s Layer 2 Lightning Network for custody and settlement services, particularly in the realm of cross-border payments. Exploring the potential of this technology opens up opportunities for Bakkt to offer efficient and secure financial services.</p>



<p>The company believes that there is more traction and momentum in the crypto markets outside the US, attributing it to the faster pace of regulatory clarity in these regions. As a result, Bakkt aims to tap into these markets to drive the growth of its platform and better serve its international customer base.</p>



<p>By expanding its operations to Hong Kong, UK, and EU, the company hopes to navigate the regulatory landscape more effectively and capitalize on the growing demand for digital asset services in these regions. With a focus on jurisdictions that offer clearer guidelines, Bakkt aims to position itself as a leader in the global digital asset market.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>FTX accuses BlockFi of abusing bankruptcy rules, while Three Arrows Capital and the SEC oppose BlockFi&#8217;s proposed plan.</em></li>



<li><em>Disputed transactions worth billions of dollars are at stake in the legal battle.</em></li>



<li><em>The outcome will be determined in a New Jersey court hearing on July 13.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a dramatic turn of events, defunct crypto lender BlockFi is facing allegations of abusing bankruptcy rules, as stated in a legal <a href="https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/blockfi/Home-DocketInfo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filing</a> by FTX.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-414-1024x535.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="535" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-414-1024x535.png" alt="BlockFi Faces Difficulty As FTX Accuses Abuse Of Bankruptcy Rules" class="wp-image-200671" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-414-1024x535.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-414-300x157.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-414-768x401.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-414-750x392.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-414-1140x596.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-414.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="BlockFi Faces Difficulty As FTX Accuses Abuse Of Bankruptcy Rules 19"></a></figure></div>


<p>With over a billion dollars of disputed transactions hanging in the balance, FTX claims that BlockFi&#8217;s proposed plans are unfair and downplay FTX&#8217;s significant claims, having bailed out BlockFi last year before facing its own bankruptcy filing.</p>



<p>FTX argues that the plan disregards procedural fairness and due process requirements. <a href="https://coincu.com/200607-ftx-postponing-sale-ftx-japan-reboot-process/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX</a> cites substantial repayments and collateral related to a loan with its trading arm Alameda Research, as well as collateral pledges worth $1 billion made by Emergent Fidelity, a company established by FTX&#8217;s former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, to hold shares in Robinhood.</p>



<p>The proposed plans, which are set to be discussed in a New Jersey court hearing on July 13, are also facing opposition from liquidated hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>

<p>These legal filings aim to untangle complex financial transactions among crypto companies that are undergoing separate bankruptcy cases in their quest to repay customers and other creditors. BlockFi may also have claims against FTX in parallel proceedings held in Delaware, to which FTX&#8217;s lawyers anticipate objecting, according to the filing.</p>



<p>In addition to FTX&#8217;s opposition, Three Arrows Capital, owed over $220 million by BlockFi, expresses discontent with not being given an opportunity to contest fraud allegations. The <a href="https://coincu.com/197435-sec-waives-blockfi-30m-fine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEC</a> also raises concerns over vague and broad clauses that release the crypto lender and its management.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-415.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="860" height="573" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-415.png" alt="BlockFi Faces Difficulty As FTX Accuses Abuse Of Bankruptcy Rules" class="wp-image-200672" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-415.png 860w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-415-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-415-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-415-750x500.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px" title="BlockFi Faces Difficulty As FTX Accuses Abuse Of Bankruptcy Rules 21"></a></figure></div>


<p>This high-stakes legal battle showcases the challenges and complexities of the cryptocurrency industry as it grapples with bankruptcy proceedings and strives to address the needs of stakeholders. The upcoming court hearing will shed further light on the contested plans and determine the future course of action for BlockFi and its creditors.</p>



<p>As Coincu <a href="https://coincu.com/198497-blockfi-faces-dissolution/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, BlockFi&#8217;s creditors submitted a petition to liquidate the firm, claiming management of fraud and misbehavior. The insolvent cryptocurrency lender was accused of delaying proceedings in order to arrange legal releases for key executives.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Cryptocurrency exchange Bittrex is accused of violating state laws and regulatory requirements.</em></li>



<li><em>Florida OFR opposes Bittrex&#8217;s request for Automatic Stay and files a complaint.</em></li>



<li><em>The exchange also surrenders its license, files for bankruptcy, and questions SEC jurisdiction.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a recent development, Bittrex, a cryptocurrency exchange, has come under scrutiny for allegedly violating multiple state laws, as <a href="https://casedocs.omniagentsolutions.com/cmsvol2/pub_47475/a9064de6-692c-4960-9f3f-8a02b62d2563_175.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> in court filings.</strong></h5>

<p>The Florida Office of Financial Regulation (OFR) has accused <a href="https://coincu.com/193211-bittrex-is-not-allowed-to-refund/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bittrex</a> of various violations, including the failure to properly segregate customer assets and maintain a sufficient surety bond.</p>



<p>The OFR&#8217;s filing opposes Bittrex&#8217;s request for Automatic Stay, which aims to prevent certain creditors from taking action against the bankrupt estate. Assistant General Counsel Brandon Greenberg highlighted that the regulator had previously advised the exchange on resolving the charges against it.</p>



<p>The OFR collaborated with financial regulators from Texas, Maryland, and Michigan in a comprehensive examination of the exchange from October 2022 to March 2023. Following the investigation, the OFR issued a three-count complaint against the exchange platform on April 17. On the same day, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused Bittrex of violating federal laws related to operating as a securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-412.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-412-1024x512.png" alt="Bittrex Faces Challenge From Florida Authorities With Pre-Bankruptcy Claims" class="wp-image-200663" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-412-1024x512.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-412-300x150.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-412-768x384.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-412-360x180.png 360w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-412-750x375.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-412-1140x570.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-412.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Bittrex Faces Challenge From Florida Authorities With Pre-Bankruptcy Claims 23"></a></figure></div>


<p>Despite the OFR&#8217;s suggestion to engage in discussions and explore avenues for settlement, Bittrex expressed disappointment over the enforcement action. The company later surrendered its money transmitter license on April 30 and subsequently filed for bankruptcy in Delaware on May 8.</p>



<p>The allegations against Bittrex highlight the increasing regulatory scrutiny faced by cryptocurrency exchanges and the importance of compliance with state and federal regulations. The case underscores the ongoing efforts of financial regulators to ensure integrity and legal compliance within the cryptocurrency industry.</p>



<p>The exchange is also questioning the <a href="https://coincu.com/181924-sec-charges-bittrex-violated-securities-law/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEC</a>&#8216;s (Securities and Exchange Commission) power to regulate its activities based on securities offenses.</p>

<p><a href="https://coincu.com/200332-regulatory-pressures-plague-coinbase-causing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a> filed a motion to dismiss the SEC&#8217;s accusations against the company last week. Motivating their stance, the exchange accused the government of overreach, claiming that crypto assets may not even be subject to its jurisdiction.</p>



<p>Bittrex has chosen to follow in the footsteps of Coinbase. While the exchange is in court as a result of bankruptcy processes, the move for dismissal of charges relates to distinct litigation, which was brought soon after the firm chose to depart America. It had already been under investigation since 2017 and had been in futile negotiations with the SEC since 2022 at that time.</p>
