			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Nigeria&rsquo;s securities regulator is considering granting exchanges that deal in asset-backed licenses to operate. The SEC, however, has no intention of allowing crypto trading. </p>
<p>Bloomberg reports that Nigeria&rsquo;s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is considering permitting tokenised coin offerings on licensed digital exchanges backed by assets, including equity, debt, and property, but has no plans of permitting crypto trading.</p>
<p>Abdulkadir Abbas, head of securities and investment services at the agency, informed Bloomberg of SEC&rsquo;s plan and added:</p>

<p>We always like to start, as a regulator, with a very simple clear proposal before we go into the complex ones.</p>

<p>The regulator is processing applications for digital exchanges on a trial basis in an effort to broaden market participation in Nigeria, where the central bank currently restricts cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Digital exchanges will undergo one year of &ldquo;regulatory incubation,&rdquo; where they can offer limited services under the SEC&rsquo;s supervision. Abbas said to Bloomberg:</p>

<p>By the 10th month, we should be able to make a determination whether to register the firm, extend the incubation period or even ask the firm to stop operation.</p>

Nigeria May Officially Recognise Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrencies
<p>West Africa, particularly Nigeria, is responsible for the most significant volume of crypto transactions concluded on peer-to-peer platforms outside of the US. The SEC&rsquo;s decision may attract Nigeria&rsquo;s digital-savvy population to local assets such as equities which have, according to Bloomberg, been shunned for years.</p>
<p>Despite the central bank&rsquo;s restriction on cryptocurrencies, a new bill which would legally recognise the use of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is in the works. If passed, the bill would amend the 2007 Investments and Securities Act and further recognise Bitcoin as legal capital for investment purposes.</p>
<p>The SEC will wait to register digital asset exchanges until it agrees with the central bank.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The cryptocurrency market has seen tremendous growth and volatility over the past year. Litecoin (LTC) and Polygon (MATIC) have been gaining traction due to their performance and unique use cases.</p>
<p>A new token with a unique real-world use case, Collateral Network (COLT) has emerged with a presale that has caught the attention of the market experts and crypto community. With predictions of 3000% plus growth predictions it is one that is not to be missed.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s8">Does Litecoin have a good future?</p>
<p>Litecoin (LTC) has been around since 2011, and it is one of the most well-established cryptocurrencies in the market.</p>
<p>A former Google engineer Charlie Lee designed Litecoin to be a faster and cheaper alternative to Bitcoin (BTC). For that reason, many consider Litecoin a &lsquo;silver to Bitcoin's gold.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Litecoin uses a different mining algorithm than Bitcoin, allowing faster block processing times and lower transaction fees.</p>
<p>However, Litecoin still has some of the disadvantages of Bitcoin. Notably, Litecoin still uses a proof of work consensus mechanism.</p>
<p>Despite these disadvantages, the token&rsquo;s recent performance was good, especially after investors moved away from centralized tokens. Thanks to its strong reputation for decentralization, Litecoin has shown impressive growth in recent months. Litecoin, at the time of writing, is priced at $86.87.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="s8">What is Polygon (MATIC) used for?</p>
<p>Polygon (MATIC) is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, designed to solve the network's scalability issues.</p>
<p>The token saw significant growth in 2021 and 2022, likely thanks to the rise in popularity of DeFi and NFTs. Polygon is a key tool to enable DeFi and other complex use cases on Ethereum.</p>
<p>For one, Polygon offers significantly lower transaction fees than the Ethereum network. This is due to its layer 2 architecture, which offloads a lot of the computational burden to a sidechain, resulting in lower gas fees.</p>
<p>At the same time, Polygon is compatible with Ethereum, which helps it attract the biggest blockchain developer community out there. This interoperability makes it easier for developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts on Polygon.</p>
<p>Therefore, cryptocurrencies like Polygon are crucial because of their role in the Ethereum ecosystem. Polygon enables complex Web3 applications on the network. Hence, as long as Ethereum keeps growing, Polygon will grow too.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s8">Collateral Network (COLT) the crypto newcomer with huge potential</p>
<p>Collateral Network (COLT) aims to disrupt the lending industry with its decentralized lending protocol for real-world assets. Collateral Network will enable users to borrow cryptocurrencies against physical assets. These assets include fine art, gold, watches, diamonds, and collectibles.</p>
<p>What is especially unique about Collateral Network is that it is the first project to mint NFTs against physical assets. Collateral Network fractionalizes them, allowing numerous members of the community to fund the loans.</p>
<p>This means that borrowers can quickly unlock cash from their assets, sometimes in as little as 24 hours. As loans are not based on future income borrowers are able to maintain their privacy as no credit checks are required.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Collateral Network provides investors with a low-risk alternative to holding stablecoins and provides them with the potential to earn passive income. All loans on Collateral Network are 100% backed by real assets, giving added security to investors.</p>
<p>Collateral Network&rsquo;s (COLT) presale is set for a further price increase from its current value of $0.014, and analysts predict a 3,500% (35X) price increase over the next few months. It is likely the price could 100X when it lists on major exchanges like Uniswap.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The cryptocurrency market has seen tremendous growth and volatility over the past year. Litecoin (LTC) and Polygon (MATIC) have been gaining traction due to their performance and unique use cases.</p>
<p>A new token with a unique real-world use case, Collateral Network (COLT) has emerged with a presale that has caught the attention of the market experts and crypto community. With predictions of 3000% plus growth predictions it is one that is not to be missed.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s8">Does Litecoin have a good future?</p>
<p>Litecoin (LTC) has been around since 2011, and it is one of the most well-established cryptocurrencies in the market.</p>
<p>A former Google engineer Charlie Lee designed Litecoin to be a faster and cheaper alternative to Bitcoin (BTC). For that reason, many consider Litecoin a &lsquo;silver to Bitcoin's gold.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Litecoin uses a different mining algorithm than Bitcoin, allowing faster block processing times and lower transaction fees.</p>
<p>However, Litecoin still has some of the disadvantages of Bitcoin. Notably, Litecoin still uses a proof of work consensus mechanism.</p>
<p>Despite these disadvantages, the token&rsquo;s recent performance was good, especially after investors moved away from centralized tokens. Thanks to its strong reputation for decentralization, Litecoin has shown impressive growth in recent months. Litecoin, at the time of writing, is priced at $86.87.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="s8">What is Polygon (MATIC) used for?</p>
<p>Polygon (MATIC) is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, designed to solve the network's scalability issues.</p>
<p>The token saw significant growth in 2021 and 2022, likely thanks to the rise in popularity of DeFi and NFTs. Polygon is a key tool to enable DeFi and other complex use cases on Ethereum.</p>
<p>For one, Polygon offers significantly lower transaction fees than the Ethereum network. This is due to its layer 2 architecture, which offloads a lot of the computational burden to a sidechain, resulting in lower gas fees.</p>
<p>At the same time, Polygon is compatible with Ethereum, which helps it attract the biggest blockchain developer community out there. This interoperability makes it easier for developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts on Polygon.</p>
<p>Therefore, cryptocurrencies like Polygon are crucial because of their role in the Ethereum ecosystem. Polygon enables complex Web3 applications on the network. Hence, as long as Ethereum keeps growing, Polygon will grow too.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Investors have been watching narratives develop in crypto. The liquid staking narrative and the traditional market solutions narrative are two critical narratives. Lido DAO (LDO) leads the liquid staking narrative, and Uwerx, a young disruptive protocol, leads the traditional market solutions narrative with the freelancing industry clearly in its crosshairs. The Uwerx Presale Uwerx has opened its presale and given the world access to participate in the first stages of this disruptive protocol&rsquo;s journey. Uwerx will build a decentralized freelancing platform to represent the industry's current requirements, streamlining the service, reducing fees, increasing security, and putting freelancers first with intellectual property rights protection. According to Forbes, almost 90% of business leaders reported talent platforms would be somewhat or very important to their organization's future competitive advantage. Blockchain has a natural record-keeping application, and Uwerx looks to leverage this to solve a chronic pain point of traditional markets. Uwerx has the potential to displace Upwork and could become a future blue chip, according to several analysts. WERX Token Use Cases The WERX coin will power the entire Uwerx protocol and will provide several advantages to freelancers using the platform, such as access to premium features and boosted rewards. Freelancers will be able to create webinars showcasing their skills, and each webinar will require a small fee payable in WERX tokens. The WERX token will also be the medium of exchange of the Uwerx platform. All these use cases create strong natural buy pressure for the WERX coin, and this has led several senior analysts to give bullish price predictions for WERX, stating it could range between $4.20 and $4.75 in Q1 2024. A considerable move up from its presale price of $0.00995.Lido DAO (LDO) Price Prediction Lido DAO (LDO) is the largest and most popular liquid staking solution for Ethereum (ETH). Lido DAO (LDO) currently has millions of ETH locked in its staking contracts, and the Lido DAO (LDO) token allows holders to vote on governance proposals. Lido DAO (LDO) has maintained its market lead, but several analysts expect an extensive reshuffle of ETH holdings when withdrawals go live. Lido DAO (LDO) currently trades at $2.02, with analysts from priceprediction.net stating a range between $5.93 and $7.05 for the Lido DAO (LDO) token in 2024. Uwerx Versus Lido DAO (LDO) When it comes to growth potential, investors must understand market caps. Lido DAO (LDO) already has a bloated market cap making future growth much more difficult. Whereas Uwerx still has a relatively small market cap, allowing it to make explosive gains. Uwerx and Lido DAO (LDO) cannot be compared regarding upside potential. Uwerx has been audited by SolidProof, InterFi Network, and announced a 25-year liquidity lock post presale. Analysts believe this current moment is an excellent time to enter the presale, and users can participate by following the links below to earn an extra 20% bonus.. Find Out More Here: </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Venture capital firms have begun making exit targets for 2024, expecting another big bull run. Smaller investors should be doing the same thing and making price targets when they will realize profits. Two tokens, Avalanche (AVAX) and Uwerx have enormous upside potential between now and 2024. Analysts have given price predictions and reasons for backing the AVAX and WERX coins. </p>
<p>Avalanche (AVAX) Price Prediction Avalanche (AVAX) is one of the few alternative layer ones that continues to be popular with investors. Avalanche (AVAX) launched in 2020 and since has grown into a DeFi hotspot. Avalanche (AVAX) delivers sub-one-second finality and allows for massive scaling thanks to its subnet technology. Avalanche (AVAX) trades at $17.50, and analysts from priceprediction.net have given a price prediction range of $35.79 and $43.21 for the Avalanche (AVAX) coin. Why are analysts backing Avalanche (AVAX)? Avalanche (AVAX) hosts one of the most popular perpetuals DEXs, GMX (GMX), and many expect institutional adoption of Avalanche (AVAX) in 2024. Freelance Industry Growth To understand the potential of Uwerx, investors must first understand the sheer volume of the freelancing marketplace industry and the rapid growth in this sector. According to Forbes, more than 30% of business leaders reported using new talent platforms extensively, while another 30% reported medium usage. And analysts predict that both figures will be up next year when the survey is retaken. Freelancing has become a core part of the jobs market and witnessed the most significant growth of any market trend. Uwerx will exist in this rapidly developing space, making the upside potential enormous. A disruptor in a growing segment- a killer combination for growth prospects. Uwerx &amp; Disruption Uwerx aims to disrupt the freelance marketplace by introducing a streamlined and technologically superior alternative to the current market incumbents. Uwerx will drastically reduce fees, protect intellectual property rights, and help foster the growth of freelancers. Uwerx will employ transparent smart contracts instead of lengthy escrow services, releasing funds to workers immediately once pre-agreed conditions have been met instead of weeks later. Uwerx will leverage the immutable quality of distributed ledger technology to eradicate instances of fraud and build a more trusted platform. </p>
<p>SolidProof and InterFi Network have already audited the protocol, and analysts have given price predictions for the WERX coin ranging between $2.89 and $3.27 in Q1 2024. A significant move up from the WERX&rsquo;s tokens presale price of $0.00995. Presale Open Now Uwerx has opened its presale, and with a 25-year liquidity lock coming into effect when the presale closes, leading analysts to point to the long-term strength of the protocol and the vision of the founding team. They are backing both Avalanche (AVAX) and Uwerx, but off the record, many believe the growth potential of Uwerx massively outshines that of Avalanche (AVAX). Recently, the Uwerx Vault was introduced to enable holders to earn Investors who want to participate in the freelancing revolution can join the presale by following the links below to benefit from a 20% purchase bonus.Find Out More Here: </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Casper (CSPR) has recorded an impressive performance in the first 4 months of 2023 despite coming out from a difficult year for the entire crypto market. Its price had fallen by over 50% by the end of 2022, but the coin was resilient and started growing slowly. </p>
<p>On the contrary, IOTA (MIOTA) performed well in the first two months of the year, but its value dropped sharply in the last few months. Finally, the upcoming launch of Sparklo (SPRK) becomes the main talk of the crypto community as it's expected to be among the top performers in 2023. Already, Sparklo (SPRK)'s price is expected to increase by the end of April 2023.</p>
<p class="s7">Sparklo (SPRK) Opens up Gold Investments To The Crypto Community.</p>
<p>Sparklo is opening up the precious metals industry to the crypto community via the upcoming launch of its innovative trading platform, where users can easily buy or sell gold, silver, and platinum. Sparklo will be home to investors who like the financial benefits of investing in precious metals. Its user base would enjoy low trading fees, affordable portfolio maintenance costs, and wide access to investors. Sparklo's users would also have full autonomy over their holdings which high-end fractionalized NFTs will represent. Users who purchase whole NFTs will have the option of having the asset delivered to their preferred location. Sparklo's security is top-notch - Interfi has audited it, and the results are posted on Sparklo's website.</p>
<p>Despite generating intense buzz in the crypto community, Sparklo is still in its pre-sale. Even better, the coin's price is very low but probably not for long because of Sparklo's quick growth. Sparklo is already expected to move from $0.015 - $0.017 by the end of April 2023. Now might be the best time to join this incredible project because Sparklo will be giving out 30 extra tokens as bonus to new investors</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY SPARKLO TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s7">Casper (CSPR) Recovers Impressively in 2023</p>
<p>Casper (CSPR) is pulling off an impressive price recovery in 2023. Casper (CSPR) had lost nearly 80% of its value following the first major market crash that happened in May 2022. Casper (CSPR) was trading at $0.069 when Terra's collapse caused a market-wide crash. It then dropped to $0.025.</p>
<p>Casper (CSPR) tried to regain its lost value by rallying back to $0.05 before falling sharply again in November 2022. By the start of 2023, it started a slow but sustained recovery, which picked up momentum around late March. Only a few weeks later, Casper (CSPR) jumped to its current price zone, around $0.05. </p>
<p class="s7">IOTA (MIOTA) Drops significantly despite January Rally</p>
<p>IOTA (MIOTA) token has sharply dropped in the past few months despite an impressive rally in the first two months of 2023. IOTA (MIOTA) was trading at $0.15 in the final week of 2022. By January 2023, it had started a slow rally that turned fast a month later. </p>
<p>By early March, IOTA (MIOTA) was trading at $0.239 before a price correction had taken the price down to $0.19 before it bounced back. What is interesting about IOTA (MIOTA)'s market performance is that it hasn't dropped to a price lower or at the same position it was at the end of 2022. Perhaps the coin might see a sharp rally as the market sentiment becomes more bullish.</p>

Sparklo's users would also have full autonomy over their holdings which high-end fractionalized NFTs will represent. Users who purchase whole NFTs will have the option of having the asset delivered to their preferred location. Sparklo's security is top-notch - Interfi has audited it, and the results are posted on Sparklo's website.</p>
<p>Despite generating intense buzz in the crypto community, Sparklo is still in its pre-sale. Even better, the coin's price is very low but probably not for long because of Sparklo's quick growth. Sparklo is already expected to move from $0.015 - $0.017 by the end of April 2023. Now might be the best time to join this incredible project because Sparklo will be giving out 30 extra tokens as bonus to new investors</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY SPARKLO TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s7">Casper (CSPR) Recovers Impressively in 2023</p>
<p>Casper (CSPR) is pulling off an impressive price recovery in 2023. Casper (CSPR) had lost nearly 80% of its value following the first major market crash that happened in May 2022. Casper (CSPR) was trading at $0.069 when Terra's collapse caused a market-wide crash. It then dropped to $0.025.</p>
<p>Casper (CSPR) tried to regain its lost value by rallying back to $0.05 before falling sharply again in November 2022. By the start of 2023, it started a slow but sustained recovery, which picked up momentum around late March. Only a few weeks later, Casper (CSPR) jumped to its current price zone, around $0.05. </p>
<p class="s7">IOTA (MIOTA) Drops significantly despite January Rally</p>
<p>IOTA (MIOTA) token has sharply dropped in the past few months despite an impressive rally in the first two months of 2023. IOTA (MIOTA) was trading at $0.15 in the final week of 2022. By January 2023, it had started a slow rally that turned fast a month later. </p>
<p>By early March, IOTA (MIOTA) was trading at $0.239 before a price correction had taken the price down to $0.19 before it bounced back. What is interesting about IOTA (MIOTA)'s market performance is that it hasn't dropped to a price lower or at the same position it was at the end of 2022. Perhaps the coin might see a sharp rally as the market sentiment becomes more bullish.</p>

<p>The project seeks to break the barriers that have existed for long between traditional metal trading platforms and investors by making the venture accessible to everyone. This will be done by</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The crypto market was generally bad for most coins in 2022, but some recovered impressively in 2023. Unfortunately, Thorchain (RUNE) is not one of those projects. It has continued to perform badly despite the lessening bearish crypto sentiment. Convex (CVX), on the other hand, is on the back of an impressive recovery in 2023. Convex (CVX)'s price had dropped sharply in the second half of 2022, but it managed to bounce back in 2023, albeit slowly. Perhaps the best news is the upcoming launch of Sparklo (SPRK) an alternative investments platform that caters to precious metals.</p>
<p class="s6">Thorchain (RUNE) Records 50% Losses in Year-on-Year Performance</p>
<p>Thorchain (RUNE) was one of the crypto tokens that felt significant damage from the market crashes of 2022. it was trading at $7.6 in the final days of March 2022. More than a week later, Thorchain (RUNE) had lost 50% value thanks to a sudden market collapse caused by Terra's crash. Since then, Thorchain (RUNE) has been unable to maintain any strong rally to help it recover some of its lost value. Towards the end of the year, it had dropped to around $1.2. The only positive side for Thorchain (RUNE) is that its price has been far more stable in 2023. While Thorchain (RUNE) has not broken over the $1 mark in the past few months, it has also not broken below, which is a good sign.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY SPARKLO TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s6">Convex (CVX) Finance Continues Impressive 2023 Rally in the Past Three Months</p>
<p>Convex (CVX) Finance has remained largely stable over the past three months, which is good for Convex (CVX) because the price has been rallying in 2023, and maintaining stability is a sign of good things to come. </p>
<p>Convex (CVX) was trading for as low as $3 by the start of 2023. It rallied to $6.4 by mid-February. Since then, the price has hovered between $5 - $6, especially in the last two months. Despite the slow performance of the market, Convex (CVX) is showing a strong rally coupled with some stability. It will be easier for Convex (CVX) to lock in price gains as the market becomes more bullish. Another reason for Convex (CVX)'s performance, especially in the past two months, could be its recently launched staking mechanism updates.</p>
<p class="s6">Sparklo (SPRK) Presale Entices Investors Towards Precious Metals</p>
<p>Since investors are looking for assets to protect their wealth, Sparklo is the perfect addition to the crypto market at this moment. Sparklo offers its users a simple, easy way to invest in precious metals. The platform is the world's first blockchain dedicated to trading in precious metals like gold, silver, and platinum. </p>
<p>Sparklo reimagines the way people invest in precious metals and revolutionizes it by adding fractionalized NFTs, which represent a person's portfolio. Investors with whole NFTs are allowed to take physical possession of their assets. Sparklo will handle all deliveries to any preferred location.</p>
<p>Sparklo is only in its presale, yet has caused so much excitement. It is expected to increase in price from &nbsp;$0.015 to $0.017 by the end of April. Like many others, we believe that Sparklo will be one of the best-performing assets in 2023. Buying now might be best because Sparklo is handing out 30 extra tokens as a bonus.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>First Republic Bank has failed and has been taken over by JP Morgan, further monopolising the industry. Bitcoin is at a crucial point.</p>
A modest benefit - Jamie Dimon
<p>The second biggest bank failure in US history has just taken place, and First Republic bank, which was the 14th biggest bank in the US, has gone into receivership and has been bought by JP Morgan Bank.</p>
<p>Already the biggest bank in the US, JP Morgan will now have an extra 84 banking offices across 8 States. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan Chase, said that his bank's purchase of First Republic Bank would &ldquo;modestly benefit&rdquo; the firm.</p>
Fed maintains its strategy
<p>However, as more banks are also facing similar struggles to First Republic Bank, if they are not considered to be &ldquo;systemically important&rdquo; they will also be allowed to be gobbled up by the bigger banking institutions, leading to further monopoly of the industry.</p>
<p>As the news of the latest bank to fail hits the headlines, the Federal Reserve says that it is still doggedly on course to raise interest rates another 25 basis points at its FOMC meeting which convenes this Wednesday. According to the CME&rsquo;s Fedwatch tool, the likelihood of this 0.25% raise is at 83%.</p>
<p>Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of BitMEX tweeted that in his view the Federal Reserve would be obliged to turn on the printers again in order to backstop a larger proportion of the US banks. He also continues to maintain that BTC will go to $1 million.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">With that bloomie headline your bank is opening Monday under different mgmt. $FRC problem, no #banktermfundingprogram eligible collateral. Look for the Fed to fix that issue by backstopping a larger slice of US bank balance sheets. Money printer go brrr$BTC = $1mm pic.twitter.com/VTSViDeBeP</p>
&mdash; Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) April 28, 2023
<p>

</p>
BTC at critial level
<p>BTC is currently facing some of its own obstacles. The price is currently at $28,560 after a weekly and monthly close that saw the price draw back to $29,230. The price went down as far as the uptrend support at $28,250 before recovering to $28,500 at time of going to press.</p>
<p>If Bitcoin loses this trend it can potentially pull back to the extremely strong support at around $25,000. The 200 week moving average is the last solid line of defence, currently at just under $22,000.</p>
<p>If the Federal Reserve breaks the economy and forces the US into recession with its insistence on raising interest rates, the public could lose further trust in the banking system - and this is where Bitcoin can truly start motoring into its bull run.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Crypto security and auditing firm CertiK has stated that crypto scams, exploits, exit scams, and flash loan attacks have resulted in a loss of $103 million during the month of April.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The figures were published during CertiK&rsquo;s April roundup of crypto scams and exploits, bringing the total loss during the current year to $429 million.&nbsp;</p>
No Let Up From Major Exploits&nbsp;
<p>According to CertiK, April saw a barrage of major crypto exploits that hit the ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Combining all the incidents in April, we&rsquo;ve confirmed ~$103.6M lost to exploits, hacks, and scams. Exit scams were ~$9.3M. Flash loans were ~$19.8M.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The security and auditing firm listed out some of the major exploits, such as the $25 million lost thanks to an exploit of several MEV bots. This exploit occurred during the first week of the month, the 3rd of April to be precise. It also listed out an exploit where $22 million were stolen thanks to a hot wallet exploit that occurred at the Bitrue exchange and the hack of South Korea-based GDAC Exchange, which resulted in a loss of $13 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to CertiK, April saw a total of around $74.5 million lost to crypto and DeFi exploits. This figure is close to half of the $145 million lost during the first four months of the ongoing year, according to CertiK.</p>
$20 Million Lost To Flash Loan Attacks&nbsp;
<p>CertiK also stated that April saw $20 million lost to flash loan attacks. The biggest contributor to this figure was Yearn Finance, which saw a hacker exploit a bug in an old smart contract on the 13th of April. CertiK also highlighted that $9.4 million were lost to exit scams in April. The most significant exit scam to occur during April was that of the Merlin DEX, which ended up losing $2.7 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CertiK has reported that it was investigating a &ldquo;potential private key management issue&rdquo; at the exchange on the 26th of April. This exit scam occurred after the Merlin DEX was audited by CertiK, which had warned the protocol about key centralization issues. Following the exploit, CertiK outlined a compensation plan and urged the rogue developer to return 80% of the stolen funds while offering a 20% white hat bounty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to data from De.Fi Rekt, April saw over 50 scams, hacks, crypto exploits, and rug pulls, with a significant chunk of these being meme coin rug pulls.&nbsp;</p>
Major Exploits And Scams In April&nbsp;
<p>There were several other prominent scams to hit crypto in April. On the 9th of April, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol SushiSwap lost over $3 million thanks to a bug in one of its smart contracts. According to PeckShield, the approval function in SushiSwap&rsquo;s Router Processor 2 contract was at the center of the unusual activity on the protocol. Ethereum Layer-2 blockchain Optimism also reported a significant security breach that involved Hundred Finance on the 17th of April. According to CertiK, Hundred Finance lost $7.4 million thanks to the exploit. While the protocol did not disclose the attack&rsquo;s methodology, CertiK described it as a flash loan attack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most recent exploit to occur during April was that of Polygon lending protocol 0VIX. The protocol announced that it was temporarily suspending its Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and zkEVM operations thanks to an exploit that resulted in a loss of $2 million to the protocol. An investigation revealed that the exploit was possible thanks to the attacker using the vGHST token.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;0VIX is working with its security partners to look into the current situation that seems to be related to vGHST. As a result, POS and zkEVM markets have been paused. This includes pausing oToken transfers, minting, and liquidations.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Senators Elizabeth Warren and Roger Marshall&rsquo;s crypto anti-money laundering bill has been postponed due to a lack of sponsorships. </p>
<p>Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Roger Marshall have been forced to delay their notorious cryptocurrency anti-money laundering bill while the duo recruit more co-sponsors, Blockworks reports. No date has been provided for when the bill&rsquo;s next iteration can be expected.</p>
<p>The Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act was first introduced in the Senate in December and sought to require the crypto industry, including miners and validators, to comply with rigorous know-your-customer (KYC) rules. The Senator&rsquo;s revised version has not been made public but reportedly includes the same language its opponents have a problem with.</p>
<p>Blockworks obtained a document which outlines which groups will be responsible for complying with KYC rules:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unhosted wallet providers, digital asset miners, validators, or other nodes that may act to validate or secure third-party transactions, independent network participants, including maximal extractable value searchers, miner extractable value searchers, and other validators or network participants with control over network protocols.&rdquo;</p>

Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Bill Has Consumers on the Fence
<p>The postponement certainly affords lawmakers more time to assess the potential impact of this legislation, which makes crypto enthusiasts uneasy about the future of digital assets.</p>
<p>The bill&rsquo;s strict regulation has been criticised by many as a hindrance to the development of the industry. At the same time, its supporters argue that clear guidelines are necessary to protect consumers and prevent illicit activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
Opinion
<p>Regulatory guidance will undoubtedly positively impact the market and inspire renewed confidence among investors. However, we must ask whether Senator Warren and Marshall are overreaching in their scope or whether this is what the industry needs.</p>
<p>Whatever the answer may be, one thing is for sure: a concerted effort needs to be made to explore alternative approaches which offer more security to the market while at the same time maintaining the uniqueness of digital assets.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s6">A savvy Crypto investor knows when to buy, sell or hold their coins. More importantly, know vitality&mdash;when to buy and what to avoid. Some old guards like Monero (XMR) and Dogecoin (DOGE) have made investors have a run for their money&mdash;making them keep burning their fingers. </p>
<p class="s6">It has made investors want to diversify their portfolio with presale gems with potential growth of up to 4,000%. With newcomer Sparklo predicted to have a bright future in a highly volatile market, investors are waiting in anticipation of its launch.</p>
<p class="s6">What is it that makes a presale gem like Sparklo have so much promise?</p>
<p class="s3">Dogecoin (DOGE) Experiences the Highest Volatility</p>
<p class="s6">Even with great social media influences, Dogecoin (DOGE) has consistently plummeted, with a new all-time high of 14%&mdash;this was after Platformer reported that Twitter stopped the development of a crypto wallet. Looking at where it is now, from its all-time high price, it&rsquo;s no doubt that DOGE has crashed on the market by about 92%.</p>
<p class="s6">Dogecoin (DOGE) was at its peak when its breakout coincided with Elon Musk&rsquo;s Twitter deal. The acquisition deal was a positive development for the coin. Elon has suggested integrating Dogecoin (DOGE) to become a meme coin.</p>
<p class="s6">It sounds great, but it's still in theoretical development. Some experts believe that having a future Crypto Twitter is not a bad idea. After Elon acquired Twitter, Dogecoin (DOGE) prices went up for a while. But, due to a Platformer report, Dogecoin (DOGE) is among the worst performers on the Crypto Charts.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY SPARKLO TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s6">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s3">Price Predictions Don't Show Confidence for Monero (XMR)</p>
<p class="s6">Monero (XMR) provides privacy-centric proof of work functionality to ensure that transactions for users are private and non-traceable. Initially, it attracted investors who wanted 100% privacy when transacting. Far from that, it had many exciting use cases.</p>
<p class="s6">Lately, that doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the case, as price prediction shows XMR on a downward spiral, just after the launch of Monero (XMR), which saw its peak at $542.33 hovered to less than 10% of its peak. When you look at its bullish runs in 2021, you'll notice that Monero (XMR) failed to hit its all-time peak and was trading below $480.</p>
<p class="s6">There's no confidence as far as bull runs are concerned in the future. It's unlikely Monero (XMR) will recover any time soon. Therefore, traders are advised to look for alternative coins with a brighter future.</p>
<p class="s3">Sparklo (SPRK) Expected to Shoot to the Moons</p>
<p class="s6">As an alternative investment plan, Sparklo will give traders the best opportunity to trade and invest in fractionalized NFTs backed by Gold, Silver and Platinum&mdash;meaning that investors will have a fair chance of investing in NFTs representing real luxury assets.</p>
<p class="s6">More and more investors are waiting in anticipation for its launch since it offers opportunities to invest in precious metals&mdash;less risky assets. It's predicted that Sparklo will have a 4000% increase in price after launch&mdash;a reason to start buying now to make maximum profits.</p>
<p class="s6">Moreover, with its growth potential, SPRK will end up becoming the blue-chip Crypto. It gives you the best chance to get a future blue-chip Cryptocurrency at extremely affordable prices. It'll partner with jewellery stores to help bring new products to the market, plus offer great discounts to investors.</p>
<p class="s6">Worried about safety? Sparklo has measures in place to ensure safety. For starters, it has passed the InterFi network audit and will lock in liquidity for 100 years. In addition to this,Know Your Customer Audit will take place soon enough.</p>
<p class="s6">With unstable coins like Monero (XMR) not showing signs of making bullish runs, investors should seek out presale gems that have growth potential. With a price of $0.015 that's steadily rising to $0.017 by the end of the week, Sparklo is a fire innovative investment alternative that investors should watch.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The US SEC fined and issued a cease-and-desist order against crypto exchange Coinme and its subsidiary, Up Global Inc., for conducting an unregistered and misleading ICO of a crypto asset called UpToken. </p>
<p>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced it issued a cease-and-desist order against Bitcoin ATM operator Coinme and its business subsidiary Up Global Inc. for conducting an unlawful ICO (initial coin offering) of the crypto asset UpToken. Coinme, Up Global and the companies&rsquo; founder and CEO, Neil Bergquist, have been ordered to pay fines amounting to $3.9 million.</p>
<p>Coinme and Up Global undertook an ICO in 2017 for the Ethereum-based asset UpToken to generate funds to expand Coinme ATM operations across the US.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s settlement report indicated the ICO generated over $3.65 million. Part of the funds was supposed to fund 30 new Coinme ATMs, and the remainder would be used for other corporate purposes. However, the SEC said investors were duped into believing Up Global would limit UpToken&rsquo;s supply while Coinme would generate constant demand for the token to finance a bitcoin ATM rewards program which would, in turn, boost UpToken&rsquo;s price.</p>
<p>The regulator says, however, that UpToken was promoted and sold to investors as an investment contract and is thus considered a security according to US financial laws. All parties involved in the offering have accordingly been accused of selling an unregistered security.</p>
<p>The SEC finally revealed that Coinme and its affiliates misled the public, claiming the ICO raised $18.5 million, in contrast to $3.65 million.</p>
Coinme, Up Global, and Bergquist Settle with the SEC
<p>The SEC levelled accusations against all three parties involved in the UpToken ICO, and all parties settled.</p>
<p>Following the settlement, the SEC issued a cease-and-desist order against Coinme and Up Global, prohibiting them from indefinitely participating in any coin offering. In his personal capacity, Bergquist has been banned from participating in ICOs for three years.</p>
<p>Coinme and Up Global have been ordered to pay civil money penalties of $250,000 and $3,520,000, respectively, while Bergquist will pay a fine of $150,000.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s3">Chainlink (LINK) and Cosmos (ATOM) are increasingly seeing a drop in investor interest. This is reasonably expected because the average crypto investor is not just in the market for the tech; they want to see gains as well. </p>
<p class="s3">Chainlink (LINK) and Cosmos (ATOM) have recently failed to deliver on this front. Despite their seemingly strong fundamentals, Cosmos (ATOM) and Chainlink (LINK) have underperformed in the market, even during rallies. &nbsp;This has seen investors look elsewhere to take advantage of the market's profit opportunities. </p>
<p class="s3">One cryptocurrency currently in the investor spotlight is Sparklo (SPRK). There is so much optimism around Sparklo (SPRK) that some analysts expect it to reach the top 100 once the presale is over. </p>
<p class="s7">Chainlink (LINK) Whale Selling Stagnates The Price</p>
<p class="s3">Chainlink (LINK) saw one of the best price runs in 2020 and early 2021. From under $5, Chainlink (LINK) made highs of $50 on some exchanges. However, after April 2021, Chainlink(LINK) stagnated, and the price never saw new highs, even in the crypto peak out of November 2021. </p>
<p class="s3">Analysts believe that despite Chainlink (LINK)&rsquo;s strong fundamentals, it continues to face pressure from those who got in at ICO selling. This continued selling will likely keep the price depressed, especially now that crypto is still in a bear market. </p>
<p class="s3">This explains why savvy investors are looking beyond what Chainlink (LINK) can do as a technology and more toward where the profits will come from next. </p>
<p class="s3">Sparklo (SPRK)&rsquo;s presale has seen a lot of inflow from Chainlink (LINK) investors, and analysts expect this to push Sparklo (SPRK) to unprecedented highs. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY SPARKLO TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s3">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s7">Cosmos (ATOM) Inflationary Tokenomics Drives Away Investors</p>
<p class="s3">Cosmos (ATOM) has some of the best fundamentals in interconnecting Dapps from blockchains. </p>
<p class="s3">However, analysts don&rsquo;t expect Cosmos (ATOM) to give much in exponential returns on investment going into the future. Many believe Cosmos (ATOM)&rsquo;s biggest undoing is its inflationary tokenomics. </p>
<p class="s3">As long as new tokens keep flooding the market, Atom (ATOM) will likely underperform the rest of the market long term. </p>
<p class="s3">Investors are beginning to understand this, and the trend has been shifting towards new upcoming cryptocurrencies with better profit potential. </p>
<p class="s3">Cosmos (ATOM) investors are particularly intrigued by Sparklo (SPRK). It is a good chance at exponential gains since it is still in the presale stage, meaning a lot of upsides once exchange listings start. </p>
<p class="s7">Sparklo PreSale Drawing Investors With a 30% Bonus Offer</p>
<p class="s3">Sparklo (SPRK) presale has been drawing in many investors tired of holding underperforming cryptocurrencies. </p>
<p class="s3">One of the biggest draws to Sparklo (SPRK) is that the presale price is quite competitive. At only $0.015 and a bonus of 30% for the tokens bought, investors can&rsquo;t get enough of Sparklo (SPRK).</p>
<p class="s3">Investors are also rushing to buy Sparklo (SPRK) ahead of the price increase scheduled for 30th April 2023. After that, the price will rise to $0.017.</p>
<p class="s3">However, the use case interests Sparklo (SPRK) investors the most. Sparklo (SPRK) has a strong use case, unlike most new cryptos founded on hype. It wants to make it possible for investors to buy small units of precious metals like Gold, Silver, and Platinum in NFTs. </p>
<p class="s3">The transparency of this project also inspires Sparklo (SPRK) investors. InterFi Network audits Sparklo (SPRK)&rsquo;s; no issues were found. There is also a KYC audit which is also above board. </p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="s3">Chainlink (LINK) and Cosmos (ATOM) are increasingly seeing a drop in investor interest. This is reasonably expected because the average crypto investor is not just in the market for the tech; they want to see gains as well. </p>
<p class="s3">Chainlink (LINK) and Cosmos (ATOM) have recently failed to deliver on this front. Despite their seemingly strong fundamentals, Cosmos (ATOM) and Chainlink (LINK) have underperformed in the market, even during rallies. &nbsp;This has seen investors look elsewhere to take advantage of the market's profit opportunities. </p>
<p class="s3">One cryptocurrency currently in the investor spotlight is Sparklo (SPRK). There is so much optimism around Sparklo (SPRK) that some analysts expect it to reach the top 100 once the presale is over. </p>
<p class="s7">Chainlink (LINK) Whale Selling Stagnates The Price</p>
<p class="s3">Chainlink (LINK) saw one of the best price runs in 2020 and early 2021. From under $5, Chainlink (LINK) made highs of $50 on some exchanges. However, after April 2021, Chainlink(LINK) stagnated, and the price never saw new highs, even in the crypto peak out of November 2021. </p>
<p class="s3">Analysts believe that despite Chainlink (LINK)&rsquo;s strong fundamentals, it continues to face pressure from those who got in at ICO selling. This continued selling will likely keep the price depressed, especially now that crypto is still in a bear market. </p>
<p class="s3">This explains why savvy investors are looking beyond what Chainlink (LINK) can do as a technology and more toward where the profits will come from next. </p>
<p class="s3">Sparklo (SPRK)&rsquo;s presale has seen a lot of inflow from Chainlink (LINK) investors, and analysts expect this to push Sparklo (SPRK) to unprecedented highs. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY SPARKLO TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s3">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s7">Cosmos (ATOM) Inflationary Tokenomics Drives Away Investors</p>
<p class="s3">Cosmos (ATOM) has some of the best fundamentals in interconnecting Dapps from blockchains. </p>
<p class="s3">However, analysts don&rsquo;t expect Cosmos (ATOM) to give much in exponential returns on investment going into the future. Many believe Cosmos (ATOM)&rsquo;s biggest undoing is its inflationary tokenomics. </p>
<p class="s3">As long as new tokens keep flooding the market, Atom (ATOM) will likely underperform the rest of the market long term. </p>
<p class="s3">Investors are beginning to understand this, and the trend has been shifting towards new upcoming cryptocurrencies with better profit potential. </p>
<p class="s3">Cosmos (ATOM) investors are particularly intrigued by Sparklo (SPRK). It is a good chance at exponential gains since it is still in the presale stage, meaning a lot of upsides once exchange listings start. </p>
<p class="s7">Sparklo PreSale Drawing Investors With a 30% Bonus Offer</p>
<p class="s3">Sparklo (SPRK) presale has been drawing in many investors tired of holding underperforming cryptocurrencies. </p>
<p class="s3">One of the biggest draws to Sparklo (SPRK) is that the presale price is quite competitive. At only $0.015 and a bonus of 30% for the tokens bought, investors can&rsquo;t get enough of Sparklo (SPRK).</p>
<p class="s3">Investors are also rushing to buy Sparklo (SPRK) ahead of the price increase scheduled for 30th April 2023. After that, the price will rise to $0.017.</p>
<p class="s3">However, the use case interests Sparklo (SPRK) investors the most. Sparklo (SPRK) has a strong use case, unlike most new cryptos founded on hype. It wants to make it possible for investors to buy small units of precious metals like Gold, Silver, and Platinum in NFTs. </p>
<p class="s3">The transparency of this project also inspires Sparklo (SPRK) investors. InterFi Network audits Sparklo (SPRK)&rsquo;s; no issues were found. There is also a KYC audit which is also above board. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin has seen some exciting action this week, as it experienced a significant price hike on Wednesday due to another TradFi institute taking a beating.

Business
<p>Belgian cryptocurrency trading platform Bit4You has announced the suspension of operations after it discovered that CoinLoan, one of its service providers, was declared insolvent by an Estonian court.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investment giant Franklin Templeton has announced that its Nasdaq-listed OnChain US Government Money Fund is now supported on the Polygon Network.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>One of Europe&rsquo;s leading decentralized crypto exchanges, StormGain DEX, is looking to replace complicated wallet addresses with human-readable names in order to improve access to its trading platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To do so, it&rsquo;s partnering with a company called Unstoppable Domains, whose technology makes it possible to replace lengthy and seemingly-random blockchain addresses with simple names that are easier to remember.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unstoppable Domains has been around since 2018 and to date has registered more than 2.5 million readable blockchain addresses. Its platform lets users create a crypto-centric domain extension, in order to replace their difficult-to-remember wallet addresses. So instead of a random string of 37 hexadecimal characters, you can create a fun name such as &ldquo;hotdog.bitcoin&rdquo; or &ldquo;superman.blockchain&rdquo; that&rsquo;s issued as an NFT, and easy for people to remember. More than 300 decentralized applications already support Unstoppable Domains wallet addresses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>StormGain, which also offers a centralized trading platform, said its partnership with Unstoppable Domains will provide enhanced security and more convenient access to users of its platform. Security is improved because it&rsquo;s all too easy to make a mistake when typing out traditional crypto addresses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the agreement, StormGain said Unstoppable Domains is also being added as a new authorization method. What that means is users can authorize access to StormGain DEX using their Unstoppable Domains account, in order to trade cryptocurrencies directly with any wallet associated with that account. According to the company, this will simplify the onboarding process for new users and improve security.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>To encourage users to adopt an Unstoppable Domain wallet address, StormGain said it&rsquo;s offering a 25% discount on the price of any domain to all users. The offer will run for five days and automatically be applied at check out when users register a new address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>StormGain said it&rsquo;s confident that its partnership with Unstoppable Domains will help to change the way people interact with, and own, crypto assets. It said its ongoing mission is to provide the best possible crypto trading experience for all users.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are excited to partner with Unstoppable Domains to offer our account users a more secure and convenient way to access our platform,&rdquo; a spokesperson for StormGain said.&nbsp;</p>
