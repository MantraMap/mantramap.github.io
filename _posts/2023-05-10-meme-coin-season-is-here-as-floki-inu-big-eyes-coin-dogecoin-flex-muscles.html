<p>It's no secret that meme coins have taken the world by storm, with Dogecoin (DOGE) and Floki Inu (FLOKI) leading the pack. However, with the upcoming launch of Big Eyes Coin (BIG), the meme coin season is about to get a lot more exciting and interesting. The first-ever cat-themed meme coin has already created a massive frenzy with its highly successful presale, which has gone beyond $35.50 million with only a month remaining until the culmination of the presale.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this article, we'll take a closer look at Big Eyes Coin and how it competes with established coins like Dogecoin and Floki Inu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Choice is Yours: Join or Miss Out!</p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin is set to end its presale on June 3, 2023, with the token launching on Uniswap on June 15, 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What's more, the presale ending promotional code END300 gives people the chance to earn a bonus of 300% on top of their purchase. This means that not only will BIG be launching soon, but early adopters will also have a chance to get more bang for their buck.</p>
<p>Dogecoin and Floki Inu, on the other hand, have already launched and are trading on multiple exchanges. While they don't have a promotional code like Big Eyes Coin, their current prices still present a buying opportunity for those looking to invest in meme coins.</p>
<p>Security and Privacy</p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin is based on the Ethereum (ERC-20) blockchain, which offers advanced security features that are superior to industry leaders. Furthermore, Big Eyes Coin&rsquo;s decentralized nature means that it offers absolute privacy to its users.</p>
<p>In comparison, Dogecoin is based on the Bitcoin protocol and has its own unique features. Its security and privacy are similar to that of Bitcoin and Litecoin. Floki Inu, on the other hand, is based on the both Ethereum blockchain and Binance Smart Chain, known for its fast transaction speeds but is still relatively new in the industry.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Innovation and Unique Features</p>
<p>One of the most exciting things about Big Eyes Coin is its innovative features. For example, the introduction of Loot Boxes, which are popular in the gaming world, helps users get the most out of their investments and purchases. Additionally, Big Eyes Coin&rsquo;s speedier and less costly transactions make it an attractive option for those looking for a more efficient cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Dogecoin, on the other hand, is known for its simplicity and user-friendliness. Its most significant innovation lies in its community-driven nature, which has helped it gain a massive following.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Floki Inu, similarly, has tried to differentiate itself by introducing unique features like the Floki Inu Wallet, which allows users to earn rewards simply by holding FLOKI.</p>
<p>Community and Social Responsibility</p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin is a community-centric digital currency that gains its strength from its strong community and dedicated team of developers. Furthermore, it is dedicated to social causes and will hold 5% of its total token supply in a charity wallet and donate to ocean-saving charities because &ldquo;healthy oceans produce delicious cat food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dogecoin has one of the most dedicated communities in the cryptocurrency space. Its community has been instrumental in driving its adoption and success. Floki Inu&rsquo;s community is also growing, but it remains to be seen whether it can match DOGE's dedicated following.</p>
<p>Token Supply and Price Differential</p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin will have a limited supply of 200 billion tokens, of which 80%, including 5% charity wallet, will be available at the launch on June 15, 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In stage 13, 1,891.89 BIG tokens are available for 1 USDT. This means that investors can buy 100K BIG tokens for only $52.85. The presale, which started at $0.0001 in Stage 1, has seen a significant increase in value, reaching $0.00053 in Stage 13. However, the excitement doesn't stop there. Big Eyes Coin has also announced a promotional code, END300, for its presale ending. This code gives people the chance to earn a bonus of 300% on top of their purchase.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Comparing Big Eyes Coin with Dogecoin and Floki Inu</p>
<p>Now, let's compare Big Eyes Coin with the two most popular meme coins in the market - Dogecoin and Floki Inu.</p>
<p>Dogecoin was created in 2013 as a joke by two software engineers. However, in recent years, it has gained significant popularity, with Elon Musk being a vocal supporter of the coin. Despite its popularity, Dogecoin has some limitations that Big Eyes Coin does not. For example, Dogecoin does not have advanced security features like Big Eyes Coin, making it more vulnerable to hacking and other cybersecurity threats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Floki Inu, on the other hand, is a relatively new meme coin that has been gaining a lot of attention lately. However, its success is still uncertain, and it remains to be seen how it will perform in the long run.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What sets Big Eyes Coin apart from Floki Inu is its innovative features like speedier and less costly transactions, as well as the unique Loot Boxes that allow users to get the most out of their investments and purchases.</p>
<p>Key Takeaways</p>
<p>The meme coin season is here, and investors are on the lookout for the next big thing in the crypto world. While Dogecoin and Floki Inu have gained significant popularity, Big Eyes Coin offers a unique and innovative approach to cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With advanced security features, absolute privacy, and a community-centric approach, Big Eyes Coin is well-positioned to become a leader in the meme coin market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project's innovative Loot Boxes and charitable contributions also set it apart from other meme coins. With the presale ending promotional code END300 and a significant increase in value from Stage 1 to Stage 13, Big Eyes Coin is an attractive investment opportunity for anyone looking to enter the cryptocurrency market.</p>
