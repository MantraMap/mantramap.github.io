<ul><li>The U.S. Department of Justice is reportedly considering fraud charges against Binance.&nbsp;</li><li>Federal prosecutors are concerned about the possibility of a bank run on the exchange.&nbsp;</li><li>The prosecutors may hit the exchange with fines or come to non-prosecution agreements to protect its users.&nbsp;</li><li>Reports of potential charges against the exchange have led to a 4% decline in BNB’s price.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The United States Department of Justice is reportedly considering filing fraud charges against <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-operational-mvp-license-dubai/">Binance</a>. However, people familiar with the matter have revealed that the Justice Department is reluctant to file formal charges considering the potential impact on the customers of the world’s largest crypto exchange. </p>



<h2><strong>Federal Prosecutors Consider Fines For Binance</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/08/02/2023/us-prosecutors-worry-binance-charges-could-cause-run-on-exchange" rel="nofollow noopener">Semafor</a> reported earlier today that the Department of Justice was concerned about a bank run on Binance in the event that they pursue a fraud lawsuit against the crypto exchange. Federal prosecutors are worried that an indictment may induce significant panic in the crypto market which may lead to the exchange’s customers losing money, as was seen in the case of Bahamas-based FTX last year. </p>



<p>Instead of an indictment, federal prosecutors are reportedly considering alternatives, including fines, penalties, and non-prosecution agreements. As per Semafor’s sources, this route would penalize Binance for its alleged violations while protecting its investors and customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Binance or its Chief Executive Changpeng Zhao is yet to put out a statement addressing the reports about potential fraud charges. The latest development prompted BNB to tank as much as 4%, pulling its price to a one-week low of $238. Bitcoin also witnessed a visible decline in its price.&nbsp;</p>



<p>News of the U.S. Justice Department’s potential fraud charges against Binance came less than a day after the Wall Street Journal reported that the exchange’s users traded $90 billion worth of crypto assets in China in a single month, despite a ban on crypto trading in the country. Citing internal figures and employees of the exchange, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-is-illegal-in-china-binance-does-90-billion-of-business-there-anyway-2a0af975?mod=latest_headlines" rel="noopener">WSJ</a> claimed that China accounted for 20% of Binance’s global volume, excluding trades made by high-volume traders. </p>

<ul><li>KuCoin has announced that it will halt its mining pool starting August 15, 2023.&nbsp;</li><li>The crypto exchange will temporarily suspend pools that support Bitcoin and Litecoin mining.&nbsp;</li><li>The exchange clarified that users would retain access to their crypto assets throughout the suspension period.&nbsp;</li><li>Restarting the mining pools would depend on the crypto market and users’ demand.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>KuCoin is set to suspend its mining pool services later this month. The Seychelles-based crypto exchange cited its evolving business strategy while making the announcement earlier today. The decision to halt the pools will affect Bitcoin and Litecoin mining on the crypto platform. The decision comes nearly two years after the pools went live in August 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>KuCoin&#8217;s Native Token (KCS) Tanks 3% </strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.kucoin.com/announcement/en-announcement-kucoin-pool-to-temporarily-suspend-operations" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a> by KuCoin earlier today, the mining pools supporting cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin (BTC) and Litecoin (LTC) mining, will be halted on August 15, 2023. The platform&#8217;s users have been asked to back up and maintain their mining records before August 27, 2023. </p>



<p>A spokesperson for KuCoin stated that the latest decision was in line with its business strategy that aims to redirect resources to core businesses to make the platform more user-friendly. The crypto exchange urged miners on the platform to transfer their assets to alternative mining pools ahead of the suspension on August 15.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The crypto exchange, which is currently ranked 20th by daily trading volume on CoinGecko, assured its users that they would retain complete access and control over their assets throughout the suspension period. Data from MiningPoolStats, KuCoin Pool is currently the eighth-largest pool for BTC mining and the eleventh largest for LTC mining.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When asked about the timeline for restarting KuCoin’s mining pool services, a spokesperson stated that the crypto exchange would make the decision based on the crypto market and users’ demand in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The latest development led to a visible decline in the price of the platform’s native token KCS. At the time of writing, KCS was trading at $5.64, down nearly 3% over the past 24 hours. <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/kucoin-layoffs-declining-profit-lawsuit/">KuCoin</a> ran into legal trouble earlier this year after the Attorney General of New York sued the crypto exchange for failing to register as a securities and commodities broker-dealer.</p>

<h4><b>COMP and MKR take the lead</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Per the report, COMP and MKR “stand out as primary drivers of this trend.” Regarding Compound, its governance token COMP experienced an 83% uptick a week after the protocol’s founder and CEO Robert Leshner, revealed his exit from the lending protocol and announced the launch of the Superstate project.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Around the same period, MakerDAO introduced its </span><a href="https://messari.io/governor/proposal/3497389b-d123-4a88-a5f7-bff686261c37" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><span style="font-weight: 400">Smart Burn Engine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, which drove up MKR’s value, Glassnode found.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">The MakerDAO Smart Burn Engine is a smart contract system that allocates excess DAI to purchase MKR, increasing the on-chain liquidity of MKR over time. This could remove $7 million worth of MKR from circulation in 30 days, increase the token&#8217;s demand and drive its price. Following the Smart Burn Engine’s implementation, MKR’s value climbed by 43% a week after.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h4><b>DEXes saw increased activity as well</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apart from the jump in the value of DeFi tokens, the past few weeks have also been marked by a jump in network activity across decentralized exchanges. According to Glassnode:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The relative share of volume traded on DEXs has increased from 3.75% at the beginning of June to 29.2% today, close to the highs seen during the second half of 2022.”</span></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As noted by Glassnode, the rise in DEX volume was partly due to increased trading activity on Uniswap across Layer 2 platforms and the surge in network activity from both human traders and Sandwich bots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While Uniswap trading volume on Ethereum remained low, Glassnode noted:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“that an appreciable portion of trading has shifted from the Ethereum mainnet across to Arbitrum, attracting up to 32% of volume in March. This trend has remained elevated in June and July, which provides a degree of reasoning for the lower volume on Ethereum we observed above.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Regarding human and Sandwich bots trading activity on Uniswap, Glassnode noted that while human trading volume has risen by 30% since the beginning of July, Sandwich bots have contributed over 60% of the daily trading volume on the DEX.</p>

<ul><li>The Securities and Exchange Commission declared HEX and two other crypto projects led by Richard Heart as unregistered securities in a lawsuit.</li><li>Heart allegedly raised $1 billion from HEX, PulseChain, and PulseX since 2019, per the SEC&#8217;s claims in an Eastern District of New York court.</li><li>The token is now delisted on Uniswap&#8217;s front-end interface, though the token is still tradeable on crypto&#8217;s largest decentralized exchange.</li></ul>



<p>Richard Heart&#8217;s HEX token is now delisted on leading decentralized exchange HEX days after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleged that the token is an unregistered security in a lawsuit filed on July 31. </p>



<p>The move does not mean that Uniswap users cannot trade the token. Rather, the crypto is removed from Uniswap&#8217;s front-end user interface and appears with a warning note. Traders can still swap HEX on the DEX by directly calling up the token&#8217;s smart contract. </p>



<p>Uniswap added HEX to its list of unsupported tokens found <a href="https://unsupportedtokens.uniswap.org/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://unsupportedtokens.uniswap.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>. Cryptos in this list include coins delisted based on legal consideration and tokens that have proven to be scams or violate trademarks. </p>



<h2>SEC Sues Richard Heart&#8217;s HEX And Pulse Projects</h2>



<p>On July 31, the SEC sued Richard Heart whose government name is Richard Schueler. Heart was accused of raising at least $1 billion since 2019 from three crypto projects &#8211; HEX, PulseChain (PLS), and PulseX (PLSX). </p>



<p>The complaint filed at a District Court in Eastern New York also named Uniswap as a trading venue for Heart&#8217;s tokens. According to the lawsuit, PulseX was launched as a Uniswap fork, and transactions of unregistered securities issued by Heart occurred on the DEX. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Venue is proper in this District because many of the crypto asset transactions described herein took place on Uniswap, a so-called decentralized crypto asset trading platform whose developers are headquartered in Brooklyn. </p></blockquote>



<p>Included in the lawsuit are claims that Heart funneled cash invested in his crypto offerings toward funding a lavish personal lifestyle, thus defrauding investors of their money. The SEC has several cases against crypto founders including <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-sues-celsius-founder-alex-mashinksy/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-sues-celsius-founder-alex-mashinksy/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alex Mashinsky</a>, Changpeng Zhao, and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/16/sec-charges-do-kwon-with-fraud-in-connection-with-terra-collapse.html" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/16/sec-charges-do-kwon-with-fraud-in-connection-with-terra-collapse.html" rel="noreferrer noopener">Do Kwon</a>. </p>

<p>Kenya&#8217;s Ministry of the Interior on Wednesday <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=598481229140719&amp;set=pcb.598481412474034" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=598481229140719&amp;set=pcb.598481412474034" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">suspended</a> the activities of Worldcoin, an identity-focused crypto project co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman which launched last week. </p>



<p>The government is reportedly concerned about Altman&#8217;s crypto endeavor which the Kenyan ministry described as being &#8220;involved in the registration of citizens through collection of eyeball/iris data.&#8221;</p>



<p>Authorities in Kenya cited possible risks to public safety, privacy concerns, and data security as reasons for the decision. The Ministry also halted the activities of other entities that may be harvesting data from citizens until such time that authorities are able to ensure the safety of citizens. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Relevant security, financial services and data protection agencies have commenced inquiries and investigations to establish the authenticity and legality of the aforesaid activities, the safety and protection of the data being harvested, and how the harvesters intend to use the data.</p></blockquote>



<p>Kenya&#8217;s capital city Nairobi was a hotspot for Worldcoin registration last year, accounting for around 250,000 signups as of December 2022. As today&#8217;s announcement could come as a roadblock for Altman&#8217;s Worldcoin, the project also <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-altmans-worldcoin-wld-up-70/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-altmans-worldcoin-wld-up-70/" rel="noreferrer noopener">stirred</a> controversy in other jurisdictions following its debut. </p>



<h2>Worldcoin Controversy</h2>



<p>Upon its launch and token airdrop to 2 million subscribers worldwide, most of whom reside in the global South, Worldcoin was met with doubts stemming from privacy concerns. The project operates by issuing a digital ID after participants scan their eyeballs/iris with an Orb. A token under the ticker WLD is also issued although the project is geofenced and unavailable in jurisdictions like the U.S.</p>



<p>Financial watchdogs in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/frances-privacy-watchdog-says-worldcoin-legality-seems-questionable-2023-07-28/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.reuters.com/technology/frances-privacy-watchdog-says-worldcoin-legality-seems-questionable-2023-07-28/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">France</a> and Germany voiced skepticism over the project&#8217;s data collection, highlighting concerns about data leaks, and Worldcoin&#8217;s presence in so-called third-world/underdeveloped regions. </p>

<p>As of June 30, 2023, MicroStrategy held approximately 152,333 Bitcoins valued at $2.3 billion, which were purchased at an average price of$15,251.

<p>A scam targeting stranded customers of &lt;a href=&quot;http://&lt;!&#8211; wp:paragraph &#8211;&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/voyagers-payback-customers-35-of-claims/&quot;&gt;Voyager Digital&lt;/a&gt; lawyer Darren Azman, the available amount represented nearly 80% of the funds that were available for the bankruptcy payout process. The scam reportedly occurred during the court-supervised liquidation process as the customers were being paid out. &lt;/p&gt; <!-- /wp:paragraph -&gt;"&gt;-->Voyager Digital</a> has become the latest development in the defunct crypto lender’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. The customers were reportedly hit with scams as they attempted to access the bankruptcy payouts on the recently opened platform. </p>



<h2><strong>Scammers Used Fake Websites To Target Voyager Digital’s Customers</strong></h2>



<p>Voyager Digital recently reopened its app to allow its customers to view the payout amount that they were eligible for and withdraw the same. The firm’s customers, who had been stranded since July last year, had a 30-day window to withdraw approximately $490 million worth of Voyager’s remaining assets, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-01/voyager-bankruptcy-may-have-been-hacked-to-get-customer-data#xj4y7vzkg" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a> reported. </p>



<p>During a recent court hearing, Azman told the judge overseeing the bankruptcy proceedings that the scams were designed to gain access to the digital wallets of customers who accessed Voyager’s platform to retrieve funds. As per the lawyer, the scammers set up fake websites that lured the customers in by offering higher payouts to those who linked their non-Voyager crypto wallet to a new account offered by the. The wallets were drained once the customer signed up for the new account.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>It’s disgraceful. I don’t know what to say. After everything these folks have been through.” </p><cite>US Bankruptcy Judge Michael Wiles</cite></blockquote>



<p>The Voyager Digital lawyer stated that the scammers had managed to steal funds from very few customers so far. Law enforcement agencies and bankruptcy officials overseeing Voyager’s liquidation are looking into the scams. The platform’s native token, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/voyager-token/" rel="nofollow noopener">VGX</a>, has lost over 10% of its value over the past 24 hours. At the time of writing, VGX was trading at $0.17.</p>

<ul><li>Justin Sun’s Tron Group has posted a profit of $85 million for the second quarter of 2023.&nbsp;</li><li>The group saw a growth of 183% in its quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) profit thanks to cost-cutting measures.</li><li>Sun projected revenue of $200 million for Q3, with a quarterly profit of $100 million.&nbsp;</li><li>Meanwhile, Huobi Global recorded a significant loss in Q2 and is expected to break even in the third quarter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Justin Sun’s Tron Group has recorded a profit of $85 million in the third quarter of 2023. The group saw a quarter-on-quarter profit growth of 183% after enforcing cost-cutting measures. Sun, who took to <a href="https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1686371227089436672" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a> earlier today to share Tron’s performance with the community, expects the group’s revenue to reach $200 million in the third quarter. </p>



<h2><strong>Justin Sun Expects Huobi To Breakeven In Q3 ‘2023</strong></h2>



<p>According to <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/trx-expands-ethereum-bittorrent-bridge/">Justin Sun</a>, Tron Group’s second-quarter revenue came in at $193 million. With an expenditure of $108 million, the group was left with a quarterly profit of $85 million, as compared to $30 million in the first quarter of 2023. The revenue did not include investment gains and losses of the firm. </p>



<p>Some of the Q2 metrics were lower than Sun had <a href="https://twitter.com/sunyuchentron/status/1645366519260655616" rel="nofollow noopener">projected</a> at the end of the first quarter. While the revenue exceeded the projected $187 million, the group failed to limit its expenditure to $76 million, which prevented it from reaching the projected profit of $111 million. </p>



<p>Sun told his followers that the firm’s efforts to increase revenue and reduce costs were visible in the earnings. As for the third quarter revenue, the Tron founder shared a conservative forecast of $200 million. He added that he expected a 7.4% reduction in expenditure, bringing the Q3 projection to $100 million.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Huobi Exchange, which was reportedly acquired by Justin Sun’s group last year, suffered a significant loss in the second quarter. The crypto entrepreneur expects the exchange business to break even in the next quarter and turn slightly profitable by Q4 ‘2023.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Tron&#8217;s Sun And Other Tap Curve Discount</h2>



<p>Per DeFi analysts LookOnChain, Curve founder Michael Egorov has sold 39.25 million CRV in exchange for $15.8 million USDT. The transactions were reportedly part of OTC deals with investors like Tron founder Justin Sun, market maker DWF Labs,  crypto trader DCFGod, and DeFi platform Cream Finance. </p>

</div></figure>



<p>According to reports, Egorov and the buyers agreed on lock-up periods ranging from three to six months. These investors can also sell their CRV should the price rise to $0.80. </p>



<p>Egorov&#8217;s flurry of OTC deals is purportedly a move to cushion his $60 million on Aave collateralized by $175 million in CRV tokens. Liquidation of the founder&#8217;s Aave loan could trigger a domino effect of bad debt across several DeFi lending services, potentially plunging the decentralized lending ecosystem into disarray. </p>



<p>This scenario only plays out should CRV&#8217;s price plunge significantly below $0.3 thus liquidating Egorov&#8217;s massive Aave loan. Concerns regarding the possibility were <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/curve-finance-warns-arbitrum-exploit/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/curve-finance-warns-arbitrum-exploit/" rel="noreferrer noopener">raised</a> after factory exploits on Curve Finance liquidity pools and the ensuing CRV price decline. </p>

<p>In a strategic move to seize opportunities in the Asian market, Binance, one of the world&#8217;s leading digital asset exchanges, has officially <a href="https://www.binance.com/ja/support/announcement/binance-japan-%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E5%9B%BD%E5%86%85%E3%81%AB%E3%81%8A%E3%81%91%E3%82%8B%E3%82%B5%E3%83%BC%E3%83%93%E3%82%B9%E3%82%92%E6%9C%AC%E6%97%A5%E3%82%88%E3%82%8A%E6%8F%90%E4%BE%9B%E9%96%8B%E5%A7%8B-48c06be2cbce4689b01fb7e61e08a469" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.binance.com/ja/support/announcement/binance-japan-%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E5%9B%BD%E5%86%85%E3%81%AB%E3%81%8A%E3%81%91%E3%82%8B%E3%82%B5%E3%83%BC%E3%83%93%E3%82%B9%E3%82%92%E6%9C%AC%E6%97%A5%E3%82%88%E3%82%8A%E6%8F%90%E4%BE%9B%E9%96%8B%E5%A7%8B-48c06be2cbce4689b01fb7e61e08a469" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">launched</a> a cryptocurrency trading platform in Japan that fully complies with local regulations.</p>



<p>The platform launched on Tuesday with 34 cryptos available for spot trading, the largest digital asset assortment of any crypto exchange in Japan. BNB, Binance&#8217;s native exchange token, is among the tokens offered. This marks the first time crypto users in Japan can trade BNB. </p>



<p>Japanese crypto users will be able to sign up for accounts starting today while existing users with accounts on Binance&#8217;s global exchange have the option to migrate to Binance Japan by August 14. Migrating users will be able to use the new exchange from December 1, the company said. </p>



<p>August 1 marks the crypto exchange&#8217;s return to Japan after cameos in 2018 and regulatory skirmishes in 2021. At the time, Japan&#8217;s Financial Services Agency (FSA) warned Changpeng Zhao&#8217;s exchange to cease operating without a license. </p>



<p>CZ&#8217;s company said the exchange did not solicit Japanese customers or offer its services to local users.</p>



<h2>Binance Secures Dubai License</h2>



<p>The leading crypto exchange was recently <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-operational-mvp-license-dubai/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-operational-mvp-license-dubai/" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued</a> an operational minimum viable product (MVP) license from Dubai&#8217;s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA). Binance FZE, the company&#8217;s Dubai subsidiary, became the first crypto exchange in the region to receive such a license. </p>



<p>While the crypto exchange solidifies its foothold in Asia and the Middle East, the company&#8217;s European affairs are another matter. The De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/16/binance-to-exit-the-netherlands-as-it-fails-to-get-regulatory-approval.html" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/16/binance-to-exit-the-netherlands-as-it-fails-to-get-regulatory-approval.html" rel="noreferrer noopener">booted</a> Binance from the Dutch market after the company failed to register. </p>



<p>The company is also winding down its services in Belgium, Cyprus, and the United Kingdom. </p>
