<p>The crypto market is a realm of constant evolution, where opportunities and trends can surge and die down with remarkable speed. In this constantly evolving landscape, users need early access to information to stay ahead of the curve. The later you are to trend or play, the less likely you are to make a profit, and here's an opportunity to stay early and position yourself for the massive inflow of value coming to the crypto market. </p>
<p>Aptos(APT) and Cardano(ADA) are undervalued, and you can expect some price pumps in the coming weeks leading to the bull market. However, the ultimate play for the next bull season is the newly launched presale project, Uwerx.</p>
<p class="s8">Aptos(APT) and Cardano(ADA)</p>
<p>Aptos(APT) and Cardano(ADA) are two cryptocurrencies with some of the most underrated growth metrics when assessing the next pumps of the bull market. Aptos(APT) recently launched, and it hasn't had time to grow for a project that emerged right before the FTX market chaos. The network has had an impressive price trend this year, and it's planning an upgrade to improve staking and participation on the network. This upgrade will allow delegated staking, where users can earn staking rewards without running a node themselves. </p>
<p>On the other hand, Cardano(ADA) has had the most upgrades of any blockchain network in the past two years. The Cardano community is dedicated to constantly improving the chain, and the network saw its most tremendous price jump after its smart contract upgrade in 2021. Since last year, the network has launched updates to make it a better alternative to Ethereum and provide support for cutting-edge crypto solutions like DeFi. With its latest upgrade, Cardano adds a scaling tool, Hydra Head, to make transactions on the chain even faster.</p>
<p>Both projects have been building in silence, and nothing speaks value louder than when the bull market begins to build momentum. However, we firmly believe the Uwerx token is a less risky bet as it's on presale and offers a unique solution to a derived market.</p>
<p class="s8">Uwerx Presale Guarantees Massive Profit For Early Adopters</p>
<p>Uwerx is the most exciting blockchain solution we have seen in recent years. The platform easily edges out existing platforms in the freelance industry. The gig economy is dominated by firms more particular about the company's profit than creating value for users. For example, Upwork and Fiverr charge 10% and 20% for transactions initiated on their platform.</p>
<p>Uwerx easily becomes a better competition with its 1% flat fee across all contracts. Most of this fee would eventually go back to serve users via the liquidity pool and other means of creating value. Uwerx uses its native WERX token as the primary utility token allowing users to begin trading it once the platform launches.</p>
<p>However, smart investors have started entering the presale event to get in on the project early and make some profit by launch. You can join them, too, as the token goes for $0.0225 after a recent increase from $0.012. Price prediction analysis suggests that the token could go as high as $1.5 in Q3 of 2023; this is an opportunity you shouldn't miss for anything.</p>
<p>In addition, liquidity will be locked for about 25 years as a safety measure to keep funds available to users willing to trade tokens. Enter the presale now and earn up to 20% bonus tokens.</p>
