The changes could include a Republican president being elected, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler resigning, and &#8220;crypto mom&#8221; Hester Peirce being appointed as the acting SEC Chair.</strong></p>
<h2>Possible Changes at SEC That Could Benefit Crypto Industry</h2>
<p>Former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) official John Reed Stark highlighted potential changes that could benefit the crypto industry, including the approval of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), in a lengthy tweet on Sunday. Stark is currently president of cybersecurity firm John Reed Stark Consulting. He founded and served as chief of the SEC Office of Internet Enforcement for 11 years. He was also an SEC enforcement attorney for 15 years.</p>
<p>A number of companies in the U.S. are seeking SEC approval to launch a spot bitcoin ETF, including <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/blackrock-files-for-bitcoin-trust-analyst-calls-it-a-real-deal-spot-bitcoin-etf-filing/">Blackrock</a>, the world’s largest asset manager. However, the SEC has not approved any spot crypto ETFs so far. Stark opined:</p>
<blockquote><p>My take is that the current SEC will NOT approve a bitcoin spot ETF application for a range of compelling reasons.</p></blockquote>
<p>The former SEC official referenced Better Markets, a non-partisan independent nonprofit organization advocating for economic security, which <a href="https://bettermarkets.org/newsroom/sec-should-reject-bitcoin-etf-filings-because-they-will-expose-investors-to-fraud-manipulation-and-other-investor-harms/">outlined</a> on Aug. 9 why the SEC should reject spot bitcoin ETF filings.</p>
<p>However, Stark believes that the SEC could undergo changes that benefit the crypto industry if a Republican is elected president of the United States in 2024. The 2024 U.S. elections are scheduled to be held on Nov. 5. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>The crypto-regulatory tides could shift exponentially after Election Day.</p></blockquote>
<p>He explained that under a Republican U.S. president, the SEC&#8217;s crypto-enforcement efforts would likely &#8220;decrease significantly.&#8221; He clarified that this could involve focusing more on fraud cases, &#8220;shifting efforts away from charging pure registration violations (such as the failure of a crypto-trading platform to register as an exchange, broker-dealer and clearing firm).&#8221; In addition, Stark expects the new SEC to “become far more receptive to approving a bitcoin spot ETF and far more likely to take other significant crypto-friendly regulatory actions.”</p>

<p>The former SEC enforcement official proceeded to explain that when a new U.S. president is elected, the SEC chairman typically resigns and the new chairman position is usually confirmed and filled in a span of three to four months after Inauguration Day. He continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hence, should a Republican get elected President, Chair Gensler would likely resign and the senior Republican appointed SEC Commissioner (in this case famed ‘crypto-mom’ Hester Peirce) would possibly become acting Chair.</p></blockquote>
<p>Stark noted that if Peirce “becomes acting Chair of the SEC, given her lengthy track record of dissent and opposition to most crypto-related SEC actions, the world should expect that most U.S. SEC crypto-related enforcement and most crypto-related SEC disruption would grind to a screeching halt.”</p>
<p>Last week, Stark warned that the crypto regulatory onslaught will <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/former-sec-official-warns-crypto-regulatory-onslaught-will-never-end/">never end</a> under the current SEC.</p>

The bank does not expect the widespread adoption of PYUSD to occur in the near future, noting that the introduction of Paypal&#x2019;s stablecoin will not lead to &#x201C;accelerated regulatory clarity.&#x201D; Nonetheless, </strong><strong>Bank of America believes that stablecoins have the potential to provide a more efficient payment solution.</strong></p>
<h2>Bank of America on Paypal&#x2019;s US Dollar Stablecoin</h2>
<p>Bank of America published a Global Digital Asset Strategy report last week covering its view on Paypal&#x2019;s U.S. dollar stablecoin and the Fednow payments system. The report was written by Alkesh Shah, head of global crypto and digital assets strategy at Bank of America Global Research, and Andrew Moss, the bank&#x2019;s global digital asset strategist.</p>
<p>Paypal (Nasdaq: PYPL) is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/payments-giant-paypal-launches-dollar-backed-stablecoin-pyusd/">launching</a> a U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoin, called Paypal USD (PYUSD), which will be available to U.S.-based Paypal customers. According to the payments giant, the stablecoin will be compatible with select third-party digital asset wallets and backed by traditional assets, including the U.S. dollar, short-term Treasuries, and cash equivalents.</p>
<p>Noting that Paypal, with 435 million users, is the first global company &#x201C;to launch a stablecoin with regulatory approval,&#x201D; Bank of America stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>We expect PYPL&#x2019;s PYUSD launch to drive payments efficiencies and an improved customer experience over time, but PYUSD adoption is unlikely to be significant in the near term, given lack of wallet compatibility, exchange trading pairs or new functionality.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#x201C;Over the longer term, we expect PYUSD to experience additional adoption headwinds as competition from CBDCs [central bank digital currencies] and yield-bearing stablecoins increases,&#x201D; Bank of America continued. &#x201C;Investors may have been fine holding non-yield-bearing stablecoins, such as <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a> and USDC, when rates were close to zero, but yield-bearing stablecoins will likely become increasingly available and attractive with short-term rates above 5%.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Regarding crypto regulations, Bank of America stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>We do not expect PYUSD&#x2019;s launch to lead to accelerated regulatory clarity, given the stablecoin&#x2019;s issuance does not alter systemic risk for traditional markets, but the stablecoin may face regulatory headwinds if non-banks are ultimately barred from stablecoin issuance.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Bank of America on Fednow</h2>
<p>The Bank of America report also provides an analysis of the Fednow service, which <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-reserve-launches-fednow-for-instant-payments-jpmorgan-wells-fargo-and-33-banks-onboard/">went live</a> on July 20 to &#x201C;enable financial institutions, specifically banks and credit unions, to facilitate bank account-to-bank account transfers of customer funds in (near) real-time,&#x201D; the bank described. Shah and Moss detailed:</p>
<blockquote><p>We view Fednow as a needed and innovative solution to a problem &#x2013; inefficient domestic payments and transfers &#x2013; that other countries have already solved.</p></blockquote>
<p>The analysts explained that Fednow&#x2019;s infrastructure does not leverage blockchain technology, stating: &#x201C;Instead, Fednow uses traditional payment rails to produce an interbank settlement system.&#x201D;</p>
<p>They emphasized: &#x201C;As the digital asset ecosystem evolves, we see the potential for stablecoins and, ultimately, CBDCs to provide an even better solution that would be faster and cheaper, especially for cross-border payments and transfers, which Fednow does not support &#x2026; We note that the efficiencies Fednow enables are unlikely to be fully captured without financial institution adoption and resulting network effects, as well as development of end-user interfaces and applications.&#x201D;</p>

In light of these allegations against SBF, Ryan Salame, FTX Digital Markets&#8217; former co-CEO, has expressed his intent to plead the Fifth if summoned, thus becoming &#8220;unavailable as a witness.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Former FTX Co-CEO Ryan Salame to Plead the Fifth</h2>
<p>Merely a week prior, insiders hinted at <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftxs-odd-relationship-with-vertical-farming-firms-a-look-at-exchange-boss-ryan-salames-and-bahamian-pm-philip-davis-trip-to-80-acres/">Ryan Salame</a>, ex-co-CEO of FTX Digital Markets, navigating a plea agreement. These sources <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-ftx-co-ceo-ryan-salame-in-plea-deal-talks-private-jet-may-be-forfeited/">claimed</a> that part of the deal might involve Salame parting with his private jet. Yet, with the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftx-boss-sam-bankman-fried-in-custody-bail-revoked-remanded-to-jail/">re-arrest of SBF</a> and new campaign financing allegations surfacing, Salame&#8217;s potential contribution to the case seems limited.</p>
<p>The authorities have pushed for the inclusion of specific evidence during the trial, while sidelining other bits presented by SBF’s defense. The evidence in question encompasses SBF&#8217;s supposed bank deception, unlawful campaign contributions, international bribery, crypto price manipulation, and the implementation of auto-delete protocols within his firms.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the prosecution is attempting to remove certain defense-related evidence and arguments, deeming them either irrelevant or unjustly biased. These include claims about the victims&#8217; lack of due diligence, the negative impact of the bankruptcy process on clients, the rapidity of the charges indicating ulterior motives, the idea that virtuous deeds signify innocence, and details about potential penalties. The government&#8217;s stance is that such evidence might muddle the issues, misguide the jury, lead to unnecessary delays, or provoke jury nullification.</p>

<p>In a pivotal move, the authorities <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940.204.0.pdf">aim to present alleged remarks</a> by the former FTX co-CEO Ryan Salame, now an &#8220;unavailable witness,&#8221; about his supposed pact with SBF to illicitly fund political endeavors. Salame&#8217;s legal counsel has indicated that Salame would assert his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination if asked to testify. However, the prosecution posits that Salame&#8217;s remarks on being a conduit for donations remain valid under the exception to the hearsay rule in Rule 804(b)(3), given they are statements against his interests.</p>
<p>Prosecutors emphasize the credibility of Salame&#8217;s alleged comments, pointing to the trail of corporate funds channeled through his accounts for political contributions. Despite his absence, the government maintains that these purported remarks can be treated as statements against Salame&#8217;s legal interests. Reports have recurrently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftx-execs-gave-70-million-to-both-democrats-and-republicans-heading-into-the-2022-us-midterms/">suggested</a> that Salame funneled a whopping $24 million to GOP candidates before FTX&#8217;s unraveling.</p>

Economists attribute the ruble&#8217;s latest plunge to the effectiveness of a price cap imposed on Russian oil by Western countries. Russ Mould said a strengthening U.S. dollar could be the reason why the Russian currency has struggled against the greenback in the past few months. </strong></p>
<h2>Impact of the Oil Price Cap</h2>
<p>On Aug. 14, the Russian currency’s exchange rate versus the greenback dropped to a new low of just over 100 rubles for every dollar. The currency’s latest plunge means the ruble has now depreciated by over 8% in the past month and by more than 20% since the start of 2023.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-602571 size-full" title="Russian Ruble Plunges to 16-Month Low vs the US Dollar — Experts Cite Oil Price Cap" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/russ-ruble-e1692079156967.png" alt="Russian Ruble Plunges to 16-Month Low vs the US Dollar — Experts Cite Oil Price Cap" width="640" height="393" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/russ-ruble-e1692079156967-300x184.png 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/russ-ruble-e1692079156967.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>The ruble&#8217;s woes, which appear to have worsened in the past few months, are in contrast to the currency&#8217;s fortunes in 2022 when it was the world&#8217;s best-performing currency for much of that year. As <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/american-economists-are-baffled-by-an-unusual-situation-as-russias-ruble-is-the-worlds-best-performing-fiat-currency/">reported</a> by Bitcoin.com News, the ruble&#8217;s performance at the time appeared to defy predictions that the currency would struggle in an isolated Russia.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>
<p>Some experts have nevertheless linked the ruble’s latest woes to the price cap imposed on Russia’s oil by Western countries. The price cap seeks to stop Russia — a major oil exporter — from benefiting from rising oil prices. While the effectiveness of the price cap is still debatable, some economists including Robin Brooks have repeatedly urged the G7 countries to consider lowering the price cap.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Russian Ruble is falling (black), while the global Brent oil price (blue) is rising. This kind of decoupling is highly unusual and is the best piece of evidence that the G7 oil price cap is working. Putin isn&#39;t getting a windfall from rising oil prices like he did in 2022&#8230; <a href="https://t.co/Rqmfm35WYb">pic.twitter.com/Rqmfm35WYb</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Robin Brooks (@RobinBrooksIIF) <a href="https://twitter.com/RobinBrooksIIF/status/1689647911720910848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 10, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>China Unwilling to Take Rubles</h2>
<p>According to a BBC <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66496736">report</a>, the ruble’s fall to its lowest rate versus the dollar in 16 months can be attributed to the sanctions imposed by Western countries on Russia after the latter invaded Ukraine. The report added that the move by countries like Germany to ditch Russian oil has also deprived Moscow of an important revenue source. Reduced export revenues have in turn restricted Russia&#8217;s ability to fund its budget.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Russ Mould, an investment director at AJ Bell, is quoted in the report suggesting that China’s unwillingness to take rubles may be another reason why the Russian currency is losing ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Exports are down, so hard currency inflows are down, and imports are up, and even reliable trading partners such as China appear reluctant to take rubles,&#8221; Mould said.</p>
<p>The investment director added that Russia’s removal from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) could also be a factor that explains the currency’s slide. However, Mould also suggested that the ruble’s fall may be down to the U.S. dollar’s appreciation in the past few months.</p>

Burry&#8217;s Scion Asset Management shorted the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 for the close of the second quarter, wagering approximately $1.6 billion on an impending stock market collapse.</strong></p>
<h2>A New &#8216;Big Short&#8217;? Michael Burry Wagers $1.6 Billion Against QQQ and SPY</h2>
<p><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/big-short-investor-michael-burry-doubts-sec-has-resources-or-iq-to-investigate-crypto-listings-on-coinbase-correctly/">Michael Burry</a> appears to be taking a bearish stance on Wall Street once more, with Scion Asset Management&#8217;s latest Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://13f.info/13f/000090514823000689-scion-asset-management-llc-q2-2023">13F filing</a> revealing a substantial acquisition of put options against Invesco QQQ ETF (NASDAQ: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-QQQ/">QQQ</a>) and SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/AMEX-SPY/">SPY</a>). These options have a notional value of $1.62 billion, comprising a staggering 93% of Scion&#8217;s disclosed assets.</p>
<p>Of this substantial wager, $738.8 million has been placed against QQQ, while $886.6 million targets SPY. Despite the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 performing robustly thus far in 2023, the specifics of Burry&#8217;s filings, such as purchase prices and expiration dates, remain concealed. Given Burry&#8217;s successful bets during the 2008 financial crisis, his market moves are closely watched. Yet in a surprising turn, Burry shifted from a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/big-short-investor-michael-burry-warns-of-another-inflation-spike-expects-us-to-be-in-recession-by-any-definition/">selling stance</a> in January 2023 to admitting he was mistaken by April.</p>

<p>He openly <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/big-short-investor-michael-burry-says-he-was-wrong-to-advise-selling-congratulates-btfd-generation/">acknowledged</a> his error in advising sales, even extending congratulations to the &#8220;BTFD generation.&#8221; Alongside these bold moves, Scion&#8217;s latest filing reveals long positions in companies such as Stellantis, Discovery, Expedia, CVS, MGM Resorts, Iheartmedia, and Cigna. It was around this same time last year, in August 2022, when Burry began to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/big-short-investor-michael-burry-dumps-all-stocks-but-one-after-predicting-market-crash/">predict</a> a multi-year recession in the United States, adopting a more bearish outlook.</p>
<p>In March, Burry <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/michael-burry-compares-current-banking-turmoil-to-panic-of-1907-highlights-markets-bottoming/">likened</a> three major bank collapses to the Panic of 1907, and the latest SEC filings indicate that Scion eliminated exposure to Western Alliance Bancorp and Pacwest. As August 2023 progresses, both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 have retreated against the U.S. dollar, shedding 2% to 3% respectively this month. The 13F filing additionally reveals that Scion has divested its holdings in Alibaba Group and JD.com.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies present &#8220;novel and complex risks&#8221; that are difficult to assess amid recent volatility, according to the <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/analysis/risk-review/2023-risk-review/2023-risk-review-full.pdf">report</a>. Growth in crypto assets corresponded with more banks expressing interest in crypto activities last year. However, the sector then experienced a crash that exposed <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/from-a-32-billion-valuation-to-financial-troubles-an-in-depth-look-at-the-rise-and-fall-of-ftx/">vulnerabilities</a>. The FDIC is closely monitoring crypto activities at banks and said additional guidance is likely.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Part of the difficulty in assessing these risks arises from the dynamic nature of crypto-assets, the crypto marketplace, and the rapid pace of innovation,” the report said. “Some of the key risks associated with crypto-assets and crypto-asset sector participants include those related to fraud, legal uncertainties, misleading or inaccurate representations and disclosures, risk management practices exhibiting a lack of maturity and robustness, and platform and other operational vulnerabilities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The news follows a </span><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/reports-by-fed-and-fdic-reveal-vulnerabilities-behind-2-major-us-bank-failures/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about Signature Bank’s (SBNY) collapse that discusses the risks involved with crypto assets and the FTX failure. In the SBNY report, a sharp uptick in withdrawals of uninsured deposits due to liquidity risk management is prominently highlighted. The FDIC delved deeply into the chaos within the crypto industry, pinpointing it and the FTX collapse as a significant factor in SBNY&#8217;s downfall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, the FDIC claims U.S. banks face increasing physical risks from alleged </span><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ecb-president-christine-lagarde-blames-climate-change-for-europes-torrid-inflation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">climate change</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> issues as severe weather causes more damage. The FDIC highlights that t</span>here were 18 natural disasters in 2022 that each caused over $1 billion in damages, the third most expensive year on record.</p>
<p>“Increased frequency and severity of climate and weather events present challenges and emerging risks to the banking industry,” the report said. “Changes in climate conditions, including [the] increasing frequency and intensity of severe climate and weather events and other natural disasters, will likely pose additional risks.”</p>

The move came despite the global market cap falling marginally lower as of the time of writing. Toncoin was another notable mover, rising for a sixth-straight day.</strong></p>
<h2>Solana (SOL)</h2>
<p>Solana (SOL) surged higher on Tuesday, as sentiment in the token has remained largely bullish in recent days.</p>
<p>SOL/USD peaked at $25.24 during today’s session, which follows up from a low of $24.35 to start the week.</p>
<p>This climb saw solana trade at its highest point since July 29, when price reached a high of $25.39.</p>

<p>The move came as the 10-day (red) moving average crossed over its 25-day (blue) counterpart.</p>
<p>Should upward momentum continue to intensify, the next target for traders will likely be around the $26.00 mark.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, SOL is trading at $24.82.</p>

<h2>Toncoin (TON)</h2>
<p>Toncoin (TON) was also in the green in today’s session, as the price climbed for a sixth-consecutive session.</p>
<p>Following a low of $1.42 to start the week, TON/USD raced to an intraday peak of $1.49 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>As a result of today’s surge in price, toncoin moved to its strongest level since July 23, and closer to a ceiling of $1.50.</p>

<p>Similar to solana above, the rally came as the 10-day and 25-day moving averages neared an upwards cross.</p>
<p>One area of concern for bulls is the current reading of the RSI indicator, which is tracking at 66.91.</p>
<p>This is the highest area it has reached in the coin’s history, meaning it is greatly overbought, with bears potentially waiting to take advantage of this.</p>

This move closely follows the appointment of John Guedry as the company&#8217;s overseer, bolstered by a designated committee to steer the restructuring process.</strong></p>
<h2>Crypto Custodian Prime Trust Files for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection</h2>
<p>Despite the chaos, Prime Trust pledges to operate with transparency, prioritizing its stakeholders&#8217; best interests. The push for bankruptcy protection marks a new episode in an ongoing drama ignited by claims of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-firm-coinbits-suspends-operations-amidst-custodian-prime-trusts-financial-woes/">financial instability</a> and failures to process customer withdrawals.</p>
<p>As the gravity of Prime Trust&#8217;s monetary woes intensified, the Nevada Financial Institutions Division stepped in, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/nevadas-financial-watchdog-seeks-receivership-of-crypto-custodian-prime-trust-amidst-insolvency-concerns/">signaling its plan to dismantle</a> Prime Trust and seize its holdings. Under a directive from the Eighth Judicial District Court in Nevada, John Guedry, flanked by John Wilcox and Michael Wyse, will helm the restructuring committee.</p>
<p>This panel, dubbed the “special committee,” wields the power to navigate Prime Trust&#8217;s Chapter 11 endeavors. Upcoming on Prime Trust&#8217;s agenda is the submission of multiple proposals to the Bankruptcy Court. These proposals are designed to refine the assessment of all viable approaches, potentially encompassing the sale of company assets and ongoing operations.</p>

<p>These deliberations emerge from Prime Trust&#8217;s recent ordeals, notably its ties with crypto entities like Stably, which <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-firms-face-turmoil-as-prime-trust-fallout-causes-service-disruptions-and-concerns/">encountered disruptions</a> due to their affiliations with the beleaguered custodian. Notably, Stably had to hit pause on most of its offerings, attributing it to Prime Trust&#8217;s fiscal setbacks. Moreover, a notable motion from Prime Trust seeks to uphold standard salary and perks for its existing staff members.</p>
<p>Given the mounting concerns over Prime Trust&#8217;s fiscal health and looming debts, the emphasis is on safeguarding stakeholder interests. The custodian&#8217;s path has been marred by obstacles, ranging from purported inaccessibility of legacy digital currency wallets to facing charges of neglecting fiduciary duties. Documentation from the <a href="https://cases.stretto.com/public/X274/12458/PLEADINGS/1245808152380000000027.pdf">Chapter 11 submission</a> pinpoints Prime Trust&#8217;s debts in the ballpark of $100 million to $500 million.</p>

Sales rose by 0.7%, better than the 0.4% expected, and this comes following a 0.2% increase in June. Ethereum also remained unchanged prior to the data.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) was trading in the red for the majority of the day, as price consolidated prior to the release of U.S. retail sales data.</p>
<p>After peaking at $29,660.25 to start the week, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD fell to a low of $29,272.35 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>Since moving above $30,000 on August 8, the world&#x2019;s largest cryptocurrency has mostly trended sideways.</p>

<p>One reason for a lack of direction appears to be due to the relative strength index (RSI) tracking between a support and resistance of its own.</p>
<p>The index is currently at a reading of 47.57, and has mostly moved between a floor at 47.00, and ceiling at 49.00 in recent days.</p>
<p>For bulls, a breakout above the 49.00 zone will also likely be the straw needed to break the camel&#x2019;s back.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) has remained largely unchanged in the past few days, rising by 0.11% in the past week.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD bottomed out at $1,837.21 so far during today&#x2019;s session, which is almost $20.00 lower than Monday&#x2019;s high.</p>
<p>Price has mostly consolidated around a support point of $1,830 in recent days, however the prospect of a moving average crossover is keeping bullish hopes alive.</p>

<p>The 10-day (red), and 25-day (blue) moving averages are on the cusp of an upwards crossover, which could likely send prices above $1,900.</p>
<p>Similar to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, there will first need to be a breakout above a ceiling on the RSI indicator for this to take place.</p>
<p>On this occasion the resistance point is at 47.00, and the index is currently tracking at 45.23.</p>

However, 2023 has painted a different picture, positioning cryptocurrency as one of the best-performing investments. According to CoinMarketCap, the total crypto market capitalization rebounded from a low of $780.9 billion to a staggering $1.2198 trillion. Amid this resurgence, LBank, after a few years of dormancy, has announced the reboot of its IEO.

<p><strong>Key Insights from the Data:</strong></p>
<p>Extreme Performers: VEN stands out remarkably with an opening surge of 100% and a jaw-dropping peak surge of 5300%. DBC, with its 300% opening and 2096% peak, also highlights the potential of high return for investors when the right project is picked.</p>
<p>Steady Climbers: Projects like BLOC, SEER, and INK might not have the most impressive opening surges, but their peak surges underline the importance of holding onto investments and the potential for long-term gains.</p>
<p>Consistent Performers: Both CMT and DDD had modest opening surges but still managed to deliver reasonable peak surges. These indicate that even projects that start with a quieter entry can offer profitable opportunities.</p>
<p>Risky Endeavors: While the data predominantly showcases successes, it&#8217;s also essential to note projects like INK and DDD. Their minimal to zero opening surges serve as a reminder of the risks inherent in IEO investments.</p>
<p>This data also showcases a strong correlation between the initial surge and peak surge. In simpler terms, projects with an impressive opening usually fare well in the long run. From the data, it&#8217;s evident that investing in LBank&#8217;s IEOs can provide returns in the short term. Holding onto these investments for an extended period might amplify the gains further, as exemplified by the metaverse project SAND.</p>
<p><strong>LBank&#8217;s Current Market Stance:</strong></p>
<p>While LBank carries a notable legacy, it is essential to consider contemporary metrics when assessing its present standing. According to the H1 report from CoinMarketCap, LBank is featured among the top five global exchanges, an indication of its continued relevance and adaptability in the fast-evolving crypto landscape. Holding a 4.6% market share in spot trading volume, it&#8217;s intriguing to observe their strategic emphasis on MEME coins. This focus, often seen as a blend of calculated risk and innovative market positioning, distinguishes LBank from many of its counterparts.</p>

<p>To conclude, based on the available data and recent market performances, one can argue that LBank remains a significant player in the exchange arena. As they reboot their IEO, it might be a space to watch for investors keen on exploring fresh avenues.</p>
