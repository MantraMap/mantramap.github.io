The Axie Infinity price has skyrocketed in the past week; the altcoin has secured close to 40% appreciation. On the daily chart, AXS registered a 4.8% spike. This positive price sentiment can be tied to the recent developments within the AXS ecosystem. Axie Infinity&#8217;s community made its first move into developing the project into a decentralized future just a day ago. According to the technical outlook, buyers have made a strong comeback in the market. This has caused major accumulation over the past trading sessions. AXS formed a tall green wick tied to increased trading activity to corroborate the same. The chance of a price pullback cannot be ruled out, considering that the coin surged substantially overnight. Buyers might have difficulty sustaining the price breakout, so that AXS will travel close to its immediate support level. Only if this rally pushes the coin above the $10 level can AXS continue its bullish price action. Related Reading: Buyers Rule Over Algorand’s (ALGO) Price Action, Enough To Break Above $0.26?
