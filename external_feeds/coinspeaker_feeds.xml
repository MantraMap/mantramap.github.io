<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/circle-asia-japanese-stablecoin-issuance/">Circle Explores Expansion in Asia, Eyes Japanese Market for Stablecoin Issuance</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/circle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Circle</a>, the company that issues <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/usd-coin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USDC (USD coin)</a>, a stablecoin linked to the United States dollar, is now interested in strengthening its presence in Asia. The company&#8217;s co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/jeremy-allaire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeremy Allaire</a> is considering issuing stablecoins in Japan after visiting the country in June.</p>
<p>Allaire&#8217;s interest in Japan is coming after Japan implemented stablecoin legislation that allows and governs the use of stablecoin in the country and beyond. He believes that if stablecoins gain widespread adoption for international and cross-border trades, then Japan could be a major market for digital assets, especially because the new stablecoin regulation is already putting Japan ahead of many countries.</p>
<p>In an interview with Japan Posts English, Allaire <a href="https://japan.postsen.com/local/79001/Stablecoin-US-Circle-Starts-Considering-Issuance-in-Japan-CEO-Interview--CoinDesk-JAPAN--CoinDesk-Japan.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“As a global company, we want to grow in large markets around the world. USDC is already used in 190 countries. Japan has a long history of cross-border trade, foreign currency transactions, and global commerce. If stablecoins become more widely used for such purposes, we believe that Japan will become an extremely large market.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Japan is the first country among major economies in the world to have a structured and clear law that governs the use of stablecoins. According to the law, the stablecoins in the country have to be pegged to the Japanese Yen or another major currency that serves as a reserve asset and must guarantee redemption to the holders at face value. The law also allows only trusted and licensed agents to issue the stablecoin. The entities include banks licensed in the country and registered money transfer agents.</p>
<p>Although the company will have to comply with the tough rules stated in the Japanese Act, Allaire is interested in the partnership. He sees the move by the Japanese government as an important one which opens the door for his company to partner toward the goal of a digital financial system.</p>
<h2>Circle Has Continued to Expand Its Stablecoin Services to Many Regions</h2>
<p>Circle is a regulated digital asset and money transfer company in the United States. The company was recently registered and regulated in Singapore as a money transfer company that can issue digital currencies and transfer money across borders. It is also working on getting authorization in Europe as a digital asset provider. Its interest in the Japanese market is obviously part of a larger move to spread its services to many countries around the world.</p>
<p>Even though the company has USDC, the CEO believes that a Yen-linked stablecoin would provide new opportunities. The company seeks to continue to grow and provide the necessary financial infrastructure to facilitate the growth of the digital financial system.</p>
<p>Some other financial institutions in the country are also expressing interest in using stablecoins. One is <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/mufg-bank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mitsubishi UFJ Trust</a>, which announced its desire to launch its own stablecoin platform, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/mufg-stablecoin-progmat-blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Progmat</a>, where interested organizations can mint their stablecoins. Although MUFJ didn&#8217;t announce the plan to create its own stablecoin, the move will facilitate other institutions&#8217; easy creation of stablecoin.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/mastercard-ai-fraud-detection-tool-banks/">Mastercard Implements AI Fraud Detection Tool in Nine UK Banks to Prevent APP Scams</a></p>
<p>American multinational financial services corporation <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/mastercard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mastercard Inc</a> (NYSE: MA) has created a new AI tool that helps detect fraudulent transactions and has shipped the tool off to a few banks.</p>
<p>Mastercard calls its AI tool the Consumer Fraud Risk system and has already installed it in nine UK banks in the UK. Some include Bank of Scotland Plc, Lloyds Banking Group Plc, and Natwest Group Plc.</p>
<p>According to a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-05/mastercard-s-ai-tool-helps-nine-british-banks-tackle-scams/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a>, Mastercard trained its AI tool using years of transaction data. This training allows the tool to predict customer attempts to move funds that may be flagged for authorized push payment (APP) scams. These scams fraudulently convince a person to transfer money to an account feigning legitimacy. Fraudsters may create accounts and pretend they belong to a business, known friend, or family member.</p>
<p>According to Mastercard’s president of cyber and intelligence, many APP (authorized push payments) scams are difficult to tackle because they involve transfers legitimately completed by the account owners. Bhalla says Mastercard considers this a “huge problem” because since the transfers are legit, they pass security checks deployed to detect other fraudulent schemes like unauthorized payments.</p>
<h2>How the Mastercard AI Tool Works</h2>
<p>Mastercard’s AI tool scouts all attempted transfers by customers. The Consumer Fraud Risk system designates each attempt with a risk score from 0 to 999 in less than a second. Aided by its own analysis and the AI tool, a bank can block a potential transaction in time.</p>
<p>Mastercard created the tool using extensive work with banks. For five years, the payment processor has collaborated with banks to study how fraudsters move funds between banks. These scammers use this method to complicate or conceal fraudulent activity. Using this information, Mastercard noticed certain patterns and several accounts that may increase the risk of fraudulent behavior and used these data to train the AI tool.</p>
<p>The Bloomberg report states that TSB Banking Group Plc is the first institution to install the system. Since the implementation four months ago, the bank’s ability to detect this type of fraud has increased by 20%. TSB predicts that banks in the UK can save £100 million every year upon full industry adoption of Mastercard’s AI tool. According to the bank’s head of fraud Paul Davis, “it’s a good example of the power of sharing data. It’s the first time we’ve been able to see both sides of the payment &#8211; sending and receiving.”</p>
<h2>Banking Fraud Stats</h2>
<p>Online fraud prevention platform Seon highlighted the cost of fraud in a <a href="https://seon.io/resources/global-banking-fraud-index/#h-costs-of-fraud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June publication</a>. According to Seon, there was a 4.2% increase in the overall cost of fraud per dollar for all US retail services, including banks. The report puts specific fraud losses from bank payments at nearly $1.6 billion. In addition, Seon states that every $1 of fraud costs $4.23.</p>
<p>Another <a href="https://blog.gitnux.com/bank-fraud-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a> states that APP fraud in the UK hit £479 million in 2020, with online banking fraud climbing 64% in 2019. The report also mentions that 47% of all UK bank fraud cases happened through remote banking channels. It adds that the average loss to the victim at £600 per case.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-bitcoin/">BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Says Bitcoin Has Potential to Revolutionize Finance</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/blackrock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlackRock</a> CEO Larry Fink on Wednesday, July 5, stated that crypto, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> in particular, has the potential to revolutionize the financial system. This was during an <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/blackrock-fink-wont-mention-esg-anymore-been-weaponized-left-right" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> with Fox Business to discuss the asset manager’s recent spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>).</p>
<p>Fink was previously in opposition of the cryptocurrency, decrying its potential for use in “illicit activities”. That stance has recently shifted, with the CEO calling Bitcoin an “international asset” and revealing that BlackRock intends to make it cheaper and more convenient to invest in the top cryptocurrency. Fink hopes that regulators will view the recent ETF filings as a way to “democratize crypto”.</p>
<p>The asset management firm, which reported over $9 trillion in assets under management in the first quarter of 2023, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitcoin-2023-high-blackrock-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF </a>on June 16 through its iShares unit. The filing prompted a host of other firms to present their own applications for a similar product with the regulator. The flurry of activity resulted in green charts for the cryptocurrency which surged by over 12% in June and is currently up over 85% year-to-date according to <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/cryptocurrency/btcusd" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">MarketWatch data</a>. The asset manager also tagged Coinbase Global Inc. for market surveillance.</p>
<p>“We do believe that if we can create more tokenization of assets and securities – that’s what Bitcoin is – it could revolutionize finance,” he said during the interview, adding: “Instead of investing in gold as a hedge against inflation, a hedge against the onerous problems of any one country, or the devaluation of your currency whatever country you’re in – let’s be clear, Bitcoin is an international asset, it’s not based on any one currency and so it can represent an asset that people can play as an alternative.”</p>
<p>Fink believes that a spot Bitcoin ETF has the potential to be as revolutionary for the financial sector in general as traditional ETFs were for the mutual fund industry. It remains unclear when the SEC will announce its decision on the filing.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/unhappy-staff-binance-coinbase-gemini/">Unhappy Staff: Binance, Coinbase, and Gemini Rank Low in Job Satisfaction</a></p>
<p>Employee happiness is a crucial aspect of any industry, and the cryptocurrency space is no exception. However, recent data derived from Glassdoor indicates that staff satisfaction at popular crypto exchanges such as <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/gemini/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gemini</a>, Binance, and Coinbase is relatively low.</p>
<p>The tech recruitment firm TrueUp <a href="https://www.trueup.io/crypto/trends#layoffs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">collected</a> data from Glassdoor to assess employee happiness and growth in 27 prominent crypto firms. The results were presented in a quadrant chart, which revealed that bankrupt crypto lender Celsius, digital assets trading platform Amber Group, and virtual asset service provider Gemini had the least happy employees based on reviews from 80, 139, and 42 individuals, respectively. Binance and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase</a> were also positioned on the left side of the chart, indicating lower employee satisfaction, with a total of 1,257 <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Gemini-Reviews-E1400858.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reviews</a>.</p>
<p>It is important to note that Glassdoor does not provide a specific happiness metric. Instead, it evaluates employee sentiment through indicators such as the likelihood of recommending the company, approval of the CEO, and overall outlook. These metrics offer valuable insights into employee satisfaction within the crypto industry and serve as a basis for further analysis.</p>
<p>In the past year, Coinbase CEO <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/brian-armstrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brian Armstrong</a> responded strongly to employees expressing dissatisfaction, suggesting they should consider quitting. The response came after a group of staff filed a petition calling for the removal of certain executives, including chief operating officer Emilie Choi, chief product officer Surojit Chatterjee, and chief people officer LJ Brock, citing unrealistic demands from the executives as the reason for their request.</p>
<p>&#8216;We, the employees at Coinbase, believe that the executive team has recently been making decisions that are not in the best interests of the company, its employees, and its shareholders,&#8221; the petition read.</p>
<h2>Circle, Ripple, and OpenSea: Higher Staff Satisfaction</h2>
<p>However, not all companies in the digital asset sector face employee dissatisfaction. According to the TrueUp data, companies like Circle, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ripple-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ripple</a>, and the non-fungible tokens (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFTs</a>) marketplace OpenSea have happier employees. Other virtual asset service providers, such as Chainalysis, Fireblocks, Ava Labs, and Immutable, also rank in the same category.</p>
<p>When it comes to growth, companies like <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a>, Coinbase, Blockchain.com, Bitpanda, and Gemini have experienced significant expansion over the years. These crypto service providers have established themselves as key players in the emerging economy, attracting users and investors from around the world. The TrueUp data also identified Animoca Brands, MoonPay, and Bitmain as crypto firms that have experienced rapid growth.</p>
<h2>Binance Responds to the Data Claim</h2>
<p>In response to the data, Binance emphasized its commitment to hiring individuals who excel in high-performance environments and are dedicated to delivering for users. The company&#8217;s spokesperson <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-coinbase-gemini-staff-among-least-happy-glassdoor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">told</a> Cointelegraph that not all employees may align with their &#8220;hardcore&#8221; values, which could contribute to negative reviews stating that Binance sees feedback as an opportunity for growth and continuously strives to enhance the employee experience.</p>
<p>&#8220;It also means that sometimes, we have some who are not able to thrive in this unique, brutally fast environment, and we have to accept some negative reviews as a result,&#8221; the Binance spokesperson explained.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/celsius-ex-ceo-cftc-lawsuit/">Celsius Ex-CEO Risk to Face CFTC Lawsuit</a></p>
<p>It appears that yet another trouble may be lurking around the corner for failed crypto lender Celsius Network and its former CEO Alex Mashinsky. According to a recent Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-05/cftc-probe-concludes-crypto-lender-celsius-ex-ceo-mashinsky-broke-rules?sref=3REHEaVI#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a>, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/cftc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CFTC</a>) might already be building a case against the firm and Mashinsky. The report also claims that the case may even surface as early as this July, per inside sources.</p>
<h2>Celsius CEO Allegedly Misled Investors</h2>
<p>Bloomberg reports that CFTC investigators claim that they have reasons to believe that the bankrupt lender and its former CEO violated the rules of the agency. That is, in terms of misleading investors. So, if a majority of the CFTC’s commissioners can agree to pursue a case, then there will be a case.</p>
<p>The new submission by CFTC is similar to the report of former prosecutor Shoba Pillay. After Celsius <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/celsius-files-chapter-11-bankruptcy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed</a> for US bankruptcy last July, US Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn, who is overseeing the bankruptcy proceedings, appointed Pillay as an independent examiner.</p>
<p>Her duty was to find out if there was any truth to Celsius customers&#8217; claims that the firm was indeed a Ponzi scheme. She was also tasked with reporting on Celsius&#8217; handling of cryptocurrency deposits.</p>
<p>However, the examiner&#8217;s report wasn&#8217;t exactly conclusive at the time. Pillay determined that there were times when Celsius truly operated like a Ponzi scheme. She said Celsius did not exactly disclose to its customers, the risks it took with their crypto assets. The report read in part:</p>
<blockquote><p>“How Celsius ran its business differed significantly from what Celsius told its customers.”</p></blockquote>
<p>As of publication, the CFTC is yet to make an official statement regarding the potential case, whereas efforts to reach Celsius’ press have also proved abortive.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it might also be worth noting that the Securities and Exchange Commission and federal prosecutors in Manhattan are also looking into Celsius. That is according to bankruptcy <a title="bankruptcy court filing" href="https://cases.stretto.com/public/x191/11827/PLEADINGS/1182710062280000000010.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filings</a>.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/samsungs-profits-low-chip-sales/">Samsung&#8217;s Profits Likely to Tank to 14-Year-Low as Chip Sales Slow Down</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/samsung/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samsung Electronics</a> could see a major dip in its profits likely to tank as much as 96% on a year-on-year basis. It means that the profits for the company will be the lowest this quarter, in the last 14 years.</p>
<p>The major dent in the company&#8217;s bottom line comes as the tech giant&#8217;s cash cow business of chip sales is seeing a major slowdown. Samsung is the world&#8217;s largest chip manufacturer currently and the slowdown in the chips business has been eating majorly into the company&#8217;s profits.</p>
<p>Analysts at Refinitiv SmartEstimate note that the in the April-June quarter, the operating profit for Samsung shall drop to 555 billion won ($427 million). This would be a significant drop in the operating profits of 14.1 trillion won during the same quarter last year.</p>
<p>This is because the chip division, which has historically been the company&#8217;s main source of profit, is likely to experience losses of approximately 3 to 4 trillion won in the quarter. These losses can be attributed to the declining prices of memory chips and the reduction in inventory values.</p>
<p>If so, it would mean that Samsung will be recording the lowest quarterly profit since the fourth quarter of 2008. Back in that year, Samsung Electronics had reported a consolidated profit of 740 billion won.</p>
<h2>Samsung Faces Brunt of Falling Chip Prices</h2>
<p>During the last quarter, the price of DRAM memory chips &#8211; widely used in PCs, smartphones, and servers &#8211; continued to drop by 13-18%, as per TrendForce. This is because chip buyers refrained from purchasing new chips as well as used-up inventories, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/samsung-profit-likely-lowest-more-than-14-years-chip-glut-persists-2023-07-05/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reports</a> Reuters.</p>
<p>However, the decrease in prices of memory chips has slowed down compared to previous quarters. Experts predict that the prices will reach the lowest point around the third quarter and a significant recovery might not happen until 2024.</p>
<p>Despite the challenging market conditions, Samsung is focusing on expanding its presence in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). This includes areas like high bandwidth memory (HBM) and chip contract manufacturing.</p>
<p>In terms of its mobile business, Samsung is expected to report an operating profit of around 3.3 trillion won. This is because cost-cutting measures have offset a slight decline in smartphone shipments compared to the first quarter when Samsung released its latest flagship model.</p>
<p>Later this month in July, Samsung will be unveiling its latest foldable smartphone in Seoul. Analysts expect it to dominate the premium smartphone market at least until <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/apple-inc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple</a> releases its next iPhone version.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-ceo-trading-volumes-exchange/">Binance CEO Expects Heavy Trading Volumes in Next 6-18 Months, Prepares Exchange</a></p>
<p>On Wednesday, July 5, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> CEO <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/changpeng-zhao/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Changpeng Zhao</a> said that he&#8217;s expecting heavy trading volumes in the crypto space over the next few months. As a result, he has been preparing the crypto trading p[latform in this regard.</p>
<p>CZ&#8217;s comments came during a Twitter Spaces &#8220;ask me anything&#8221; event stating that the company has been doing a lot of preparations to ready its systems during the possible surge in trading activity. &#8220;If we look at historical patterns, we want to be prepared for higher volumes,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Volumes have been increasing in recent weeks, marking a shift from the low activity seen since the collapse of the FTX exchange in November. Zhao mentioned various factors contributing to this recent surge, including the filing of new spot Bitcoin ETFs and the upcoming Bitcoin halving event anticipated to take place in April or May of 2024.</p>
<p>On the other hand, institutional interest in the crypto space is also growing as trading activity in Bitcoin derivative products shoots up. In June, the trading volume of Bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) rose by 28.6% to reach $37.9 billion. Additionally, the value of Bitcoin Micro Futures increased by 21.1% to $702 million, as per <a href="https://ccdata.io/reports/exchange-review-june-2023" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">CCData</a>.</p>
<p>There was also a notable increase in Ethereum-based instruments, with over 97,000 ETH Futures contracts traded, representing a 10.8% increase. The trading volume for these contracts reached $46.8 billion, marking a 24.6% increase when valued in USD.</p>
<h2>Binance Chief Is Bullish on Crypto</h2>
<p>Zhao said that as per the historical patterns, there&#8217;s a bull run every four years in the market. As a result, he expects that the next bull run could happen in 2025, as &#8220;the year after Bitcoin halving is usually the bull year&#8221;.</p>
<p>Although he admitted that it&#8217;s hard to predict the future, Zhao said that he remains bullish for the long term. &#8220;We&#8217;re still very early. I think the industry still has a lot of room to grow,&#8221; Zhao <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/237907/binance-cz-crypto-trading-volumes" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>. &#8220;So I&#8217;m always bullish. I&#8217;m a builder, so I always have a positive outlook on things.&#8221;</p>
<p>Binance is currently involved in a legal dispute with U.S. regulators, including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The allegations suggest that Binance, as well as Zhao, violated federal laws. Regarding these lawsuits, Zhao expressed Binance&#8217;s intention to find a swift and fair resolution that satisfies all parties involved.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bank-of-england-nuggets-cbdc-privacy/">Bank of England Partners with Nuggets to Boost CBDC Privacy and Security</a></p>

<p>The Bank of England is a step closer to issuing a digital pound, thanks to its partnership with Nuggets, a blockchain-based identity and payments platform. The duo will work together to design a privacy layer for the UK&#8217;s proposed retail <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBDC</a>.</p>
<p>Nuggets has previously worked with the Bank of International Settlements and the Bank of England on Project Rosalind. The project explored the use of self-sovereign identity (SSI) for CBDCs. Based on this work, the Bank of England asked Nuggets to investigate and design the identity and privacy layer for its proposed digital pound.</p>
<h2>What to Expect</h2>
<p>According to Nuggets co-founder Alastair Johnson, the feature would use anonymous connections to swap and verify credentials without revealing the user&#8217;s identity. He added that the layer is &#8220;an important step in ensuring that the CBDC is both secure and privacy-preserving&#8221;. Thus, it will use Zero-Knowledge proofs to allow users to control and keep their data private. Again, the layer will be designed to meet strict anti-fraud and anti-money laundering standards.</p>
<p>The Bank of England has been exploring the possibility of issuing a digital pound for several years. In 2020, it published a discussion paper on the topic. Later in 2021, it launched a public consultation on the issue. However, the financial services minister Andrew Griffith has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-financial-services-minister-urges-caution-over-central-bank-digital-currency-2023-07-04/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">warned</a> against issuing a digital pound because of privacy and security issues. Nuggets&#8217; privacy layer could be the critical component to ensure the currency is secure and privacy-preserving.</p>
<h2>Nuggets’ Privacy Solutions: A Game Changer?</h2>
<p>As central banks around the world pursue CBDC development, a key concern in many quarters is how to balance privacy with the need for financial transparency. Nuggets&#8217; privacy solutions could very well be what helps to address this key challenge.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nuggets is also working on other projects to enhance privacy and security. It is working with the European Commission&#8217;s Joint Research Centre (JRC) to develop a privacy-preserving solution for cross-border payments. It has also partnered with the University of Oxford to develop a data protection solution for healthcare data. Furthermore, Nuggets is collaborating with the World Economic Forum to shape the future of digital identity and payments in the post-pandemic era.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coinbase-exec-322k-lost-crypto/">Coinbase Exec Finds and Returns $322K Worth of Lost Crypto to User Unaware of Its Existence</a></p>
<p>A Coinbase exec has surprised a lucky person with lost crypto they never knew existed. Conor Grogan, Coinbase’s head of product, revealed that he found lost crypto worth hundreds of thousands and successfully found the owner of the assets.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/jconorgrogan/status/1676689354071199744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1676689354071199744%7Ctwgr%5E9a8faa7f2aeb28fe01ad0235ae98ba10716b1ab4%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fcoinbase-conor-grogan-uncovers-thousands-lost-etc" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">tweet</a> posted on Wednesday, Grogan said he “found 322K for a stranger who previously lost their life savings in a hack”. He attached a screenshot showing address details and the $322,873 balance in Ethereum Classic (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum-classic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ETC</a>).</p>
<p>The Coinbase exec then explained how the lost crypto came about. Back in 2016, a hard fork occurred on the Ethereum (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ETH</a>) blockchain and created Ethereum Classic. At the time, anyone with an ETH balance received a 1:1 airdrop of the new ETC. According to Grogan, many had no idea they received ETC tokens and likely have money they don’t know exists.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forgetting you have funds onchain (or not keeping track of airdrops) is common. I’ve found 6+ figures for people previously,&#8221; <a href="https://www.theblock.co/amp/post/237996/coinbase-director-finds-lost-crypto-worth-320000-for-stranger" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> he.</p>
<h2>Coinbase Exec Grogan Provides Details on Locating the Lost Crypto</h2>
<p>Grogan then explained how he found the assets. The Coinbase exec said he combed the “ETC rich list” to find accounts with unmoved ETC balances. This process resulted in about 20 accounts holding balances of at least $250,000 without any corresponding activity. Although he began trying to trace them, Grogan said he ran into dead ends.</p>
<p>The saving grace for the one he eventually found was a connection to an EOSDAC coin. Apparently, EOS holders received an EOSDAC airdop via Ethereum back in 2018, using their registered ETH addresses. Grogan then used the amount and snapshot date to find the EOS wallet. He then used this information to find the legal name of the person who owns the ETH address and reached out. The Coinbase exec ended the thread with a screenshotted reply from the account owner, who didn’t know the lost crypto existed and didn’t know the same address applied at the time of the airdrop.</p>
<p>As part of the thread, Grogan <a href="https://twitter.com/jconorgrogan/status/1676689372534505473?s=20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">tagged</a> Tron founder and Poloniex owner Justin Sun, informing that several Poloniex wallets have “significant untouched ETC balances”.</p>
<h2>Lost Assets are not Uncommon</h2>
<p>Crypto investors may regularly lose access to their assets for different reasons. In many cases, crypto assets are lost due to user mistakes. A user may send crypto from one wallet to another and mistype the receiving wallet address. In other cases, users may mistakenly choose a different network as the receiving address, forgetting to confirm that the sending and receiving networks are the same. According to a 2018 Chanalysis conclusion referenced in a Wall Street Journal (WSJ) <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-fifth-of-all-bitcoin-is-missing-these-crypto-hunters-can-help-1530798731" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">article</a>, 20% of all Bitcoin is lost, with most unrecoverable.</p>
<p>However, hacks are responsible for most lost crypto. Since its inception, the crypto industry has suffered its fair share of hacking attempts, many of which are successful for hackers. According to blockchain security firm Beosin, hacks and other types of schemes and scams account for <a href="https://twitter.com/BeosinAlert/status/1674618821766971392" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">$656 million in lost crypto</a> for Q1 of 2023.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/twitter-money-transmitter-licenses/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

<p>Although there are no specific details on what to expect from Twitter following the money transmitter licenses, insiders believe that Twitter Payments will start offering fiat currency services.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/twitter-money-transmitter-licenses/">Three US States Give Twitter Money Transmitter Licenses, More to Come?</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/elon-musk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elon Musk</a>&#8216;s vision to create new pathways for revenue is gradually coming to fruition as Twitter Payments LLC received its first set of <a href="https://www.nmlsconsumeraccess.org/EntityDetails.aspx/COMPANY/2404946#RegulatoryActions" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">money transmitter licenses</a> in three US states. Reports revealed in January that the social networking service provider had started submitting applications for regulatory licenses in the US. People with knowledge of the matter revealed that Twitter’s Esther Crawford was working with a team on the requirements to facilitate payments on the platform. The company applied for licenses in all 50 states in the US and is looking forward to their responses.</p>
<h2>Twitter Gets Money Transmitter Licenses from Three US States</h2>
<p>After completing regulatory checks, Michigan, New Hampshire, and Missouri have issued money transmitter licenses to Twitter. The company can now offer transfer services or payment instruments, another profit stream. Missouri gave Twitter a sale of checks and money transmitter licenses, which typically provides consumer protection for businesses that process money transmission.</p>
<p>Since the billionaire took over the company in October, its advertising business, which was a major source of income, had declined. The $5 billion-a-year ad business got hit due to marketers’ concerns over management and content moderation. However, it appears Twitter is set for a fresh pipeline of profits. Elon Musk has been vocal about his visions, including his desire for Twitter to offer fintech services. The chief executive said he wants the social network company to offer fintech services like P2P transactions, debit cards, savings, accounts, and more. All his plans are towards his vision of an “everything app” combining payments, messaging, and commerce.</p>
<p>Although there are no specific details on what to expect from Twitter following the money transmitter licenses, insiders believe that Twitter Payments will start offering fiat currency services. The people familiar with the matter stated that the company may roll out similar operations with Venmo, Stripe, and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/paypal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PayPal</a> (NASDAQ: PYPL).</p>

<p>Furthermore, Musk’s vision for Twitter goes beyond getting the money transmitter licenses. The company reportedly plans to expand the platform to accommodate crypto services. This does not come as a surprise as Musk is a known crypto fanatic, and his influence on a particular cryptocurrency has caused the asset to surge exponentially. In addition to the crypto service, another rumor is that Twitter Payments wants to launch a project dubbed “Twitter Coin”. More so, reports revealed that Twitter will unveil its own wallet.</p>
