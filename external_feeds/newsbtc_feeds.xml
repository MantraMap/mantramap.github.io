					<description><![CDATA[Shiba Inu (SHIB), a meme-inspired cryptocurrency, has seen a notable increase in high-value transactions, with each one costing $1 million or more. Following a strong price increase in the first half of August, this spike in transactions clearly gathered traction. Following the coin&#8217;s price explosion, a notable pattern started to emerge: whales made significant volumes of crypto movement even as the meme coin&#8217;s prices saw a correction. A huge shift was recently revealed by data provided by Whale Alert, a website that tracks significant cryptocurrency transactions, and it was masterminded by a single entity that had a sizeable amount of Shiba Inu tokens. 🚨 🚨 4,657,881,590,632 #SHIB (40,747,148 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown wallethttps://t.co/g1D0dVuUjY — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) August 17, 2023 Related Reading: Solo Climber: The Lone Crypto Surging 11% In Top 100 Roster On A Weekend Shiba Inu Whale Moves $40 Million In Meme Coins This crypto whale carried out an unprecedented transfer of 4.65 trillion SHIB tokens, or about the equivalent of $40 million. This huge transfer occurred on August 17, precisely, during a single day. The mystery surrounding the source and recipient of these enormous sums of SHIB tokens only heightens the interest in this circumstance. This implies that the crypto whale&#8217;s goals went beyond merely selling the tokens on an exchange. The Shiba Inu community&#8217;s joyous celebration of the Shibarium Mainnet launch, a milestone for the cryptocurrency&#8217;s ecosystem, coincides with these substantial transfers. However, there were some worries that accompanied the announcement of the Shibarium Mainnet, and these had an impact on the pricing of Shiba Inu. The day before the launch-related festivities, the price of SHIB dropped by 11%. The cryptocurrency eventually recovered some of its losses, and as of the time of this publication, its price had stabilized at roughly $0.0000086. It&#8217;s interesting to note how different &#8220;whales&#8221; and significant holders, or those with large holdings of Shiba Inu tokens, appeared to react despite the uncertainty caused by the Shibarium launch-related worries.

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin Ordinals, once the shining star of the NFT world, is experiencing a significant downturn in both sales volume and transactions, igniting discussions about the lasting appeal of these digital collectibles.  According to a recent report from DappRadar, the fervor that propelled Bitcoin Ordinals to record-breaking heights earlier this year has dwindled, with sales volume plummeting by over 97% from its peak in May 2023.

This once-flourishing market has seen its sales volume dwindle to a mere $3 million in mid-August, marking a jaw-dropping 97% decline within a span of just three months.  The data paints a stark picture: June witnessed a 76.5% plunge, with sales volume hitting $100 million, while July followed suit with a 66.9% drop, settling at $35 million. As August unfolds, a bleak 91.4% drop to $3 million in sales volume underscores the challenges facing Bitcoin Ordinals. Beyond The Numbers: Transaction Count And Its Implications While fluctuations in sales volume could be attributed to the ebbs and flows of the market, the report highlights another concerning trend: a consistent reduction in transaction count. Transactions have dwindled by a staggering 88.1% in August, sinking to a mere 20,571 compared to the robust 832,648 transactions witnessed just three months prior.  This sharp decline in transactions suggests that the interest in trading Bitcoin Ordinals is diminishing, casting a shadow of doubt on its long-term viability and relevance within the competitive NFT landscape.

The coming months are poised to be pivotal in determining whether this downward spiral is merely a temporary setback or indicative of more profound challenges for Bitcoin Ordinals and NFTs tied to the cryptocurrency. As the NFT ecosystem continues to evolve, the fate of Bitcoin Ordinals hangs in the balance.

					<description><![CDATA[The last few days have been eventful for the crypto market following a major crash on Thursday that resulted in the loss of $1 billion in market cap. In another unnerving development, it appears that Binance, the world’s largest exchange, may be in some form of trouble as a crypto analyst shares some insight on the company. Related Reading: Binance To Delist These Three Tokens In August Due To Non-Compliance Binance To Record Heavy Losses If BNB Trades Below $212, Analyst Says According to an X post on Friday, a crypto analyst with the name MartyParty painted a rather gloomy picture for Binance and its 150 million users. The analyst began by stating there was a reason the Binance Coin (BNB) is yet to fall below $212.  After Bitcoin tumbled on Thursday, BNB, like most cryptocurrencies, also plummeted in value, falling from $231.85 to $215.02. Although the token did attempt a market rebound on Friday, it soon fell again but found support at the $214 price zone.  MartyParty believes there is a reason why BNB is gaining support at these levels away from the $212 price mark. According to the analyst, the Binance exchange has a BNB-backed loan set to liquidate at $212.  Initially, the liquidation price for the said loan was $220, but it was later shifted in June. Although the analyst didn&#8217;t reveal the exact amount of this supposed loan, it seems massive as he stated it could lead to a “fatal margin call”  for the Binance exchange upon liquidation.  According to MartyParty, Binance is presently in “self-preservation mode” with its CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao selling BTC from a particular wallet to purchase TUSD, which in turn is invested in BNB to keep the Binance native token above $212.  In addition, this crypto analyst also made another interesting theory behind Binance’s supposed problem. He stated that US financial regulators are allegedly selling crypto holdings of the US Marshals Service in order to forcibly liquidate Binance’s loan position and kick CZ out of the crypto industry.  Related Reading: SEC’s Ethereum Futures ETF Approval: A Resounding Victory For ETH’s Security Status? Crypto Community Reacts To Worrying Post On Binance Following MartyParty’s post, there have been multiple reactions, with some crypto users siding with the analyst and nudging investors to dump the BNB token, saying that Binance is currently in a similar position as the FTX exchange in 2022. The FTX exchange collapsed in November 2022 due to a cascade of events triggered by reports which stated that Alameda Research &#8211; FTX’s trading arm &#8211; held an unusually large amount of FTT &#8211; FTX native cryptocurrency similar to Binance’s BNB.  During the hype of the debacle, an inside source revealed that Alameda Research was quietly collecting loans from FTX, which were collateralized by the FTT token.  However, on the other hand, some other crypto analysts have disagreed with MartyParty’s post calling it false and only aimed at spreading FUD. A particular analyst with the handle Alice on X has described the whole report as a “bizarre conspiracy theory” as the loan in question was not taken out by the Binance exchange but rather by Venus Protocol, a lending protocol on the BNB chain. For now, Binance, CZ, or the US government are yet to issue any statement confirming or denying the post by the analyst MartyParty.  At the time of writing, BNB is trading at $215.55, with a 1.59% decline in the last day, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Meanwhile, the token boasts a market cap of $33.16 billion and ranks as the fourth biggest cryptocurrency in the market.

					<description><![CDATA[Injective (INJ) has defied the prevailing downward trend to secure significant gains. While most crypto assets experienced losses, INJ has emerged as the sole gainer among the top 100 cryptocurrencies. The cryptocurrency&#8217;s price climb comes as a welcome relief to investors navigating the tumultuous waters of the market. As the cryptocurrency market grapples with a bearish start to the day, Injective (INJ) stands out with a remarkable performance. With a 10.7% rally in the past 24 hours and seven-day gains of 2.0%, INJ has managed to buck the trend and secure positive momentum.  Crypto market analysts and enthusiasts are keeping a close eye on INJ&#8217;s price movement, eager to see if it can maintain its upward trajectory.

					<description><![CDATA[Yuga Labs &#8211; creators of the popular Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFT collection &#8211; has unveiled its plans to cut ties with NFT marketplace OpenSea. This comes as a response to the platform’s proposed shift to an optional royalty system. On Thursday, August 17, OpenSea announced that it is changing its creator fees framework, making royalties optional for new collections after August 31, 2023. The NFT marketplace also disclosed that it would disable the Operator Filter, a feature that enforces creator royalties. According to the announcement, NFT collections that utilized the Operator Filter up until August 31 will have their creator royalties enforced till February 29, 2024, when the fees will become optional.  In the blog post, OpenSea explained the rationale behind its decision, saying the Operator Filter was designed to empower creators with greater control. However, the marketplace claims that it has not received the much-needed acceptance in the web3 ecosystem. Related Reading: Shibarium Launch Saga: Block Production Resumes Despite Stuck ETH Yuga Labs Responds To OpenSea’s Decision  On Friday, August 18, Yuga Labs published an open letter on X (formerly Twitter), subtly criticizing OpenSea’s decision to make creator fees optional on all secondary sales for all collections by February 2024. The BAYC creator also disclosed its plans to wind down support for OpenSea’s SeaPort, a marketplace protocol that enables the buying and selling of NFTs. Daniel Alegre, CEO of Yuga Lab, said in the response: Yuga Labs will begin the process of sunsetting support for OpenSea’s SeaPort for all upgradable contracts and any new collections, with the aim of this being complete in February 2024 in tandem with OpenSea’s approach. Alegre noted that while the purpose of NFTs has been to revolutionize true ownership of digital assets, it has also been about empowering artists and creators. “Yuga believes in protecting creator royalties so creators are properly compensated for their work,” he added. Yuga Labs’ stance will likely be a significant blow to OpenSea, but perhaps not one the marketplace wouldn&#8217;t have foreseen. In January, the BAYC creators blacklisted about four marketplaces &#8211; with an optional royalty model &#8211; from its Sewer Pass collection. OpenSea Halts Support For The BNB Smart Chain OpenSea also recently announced its decision to disable the minting and listing of NFTs on the BNB smart chain. According to the post on X, this move was informed by the marketplace&#8217;s “need to align resources with the most promising efforts”.

					<description><![CDATA[Litecoin (LTC), the altcoin often dubbed as &#8220;silver to Bitcoin&#8217;s gold,&#8221; has found itself caught in the downward spiral of the cryptocurrency market, mirroring the struggles of its larger counterpart.

As Bitcoin (BTC) grapples with a precipitous decline, currently trading below $26,000, the impact reverberates across the broader crypto landscape.

					<description><![CDATA[According to Bloomberg, in a key development for the cryptocurrency industry, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reportedly set to allow the launch of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on Ethereum (ETH) futures. This move marks a significant win for numerous firms that have long sought to introduce such products. While the SEC has previously hesitated to approve ETFs directly tied to cryptocurrencies, the decision to greenlight an Ethereum futures ETF could have profound implications for Ethereum&#8217;s classification as a non-security.  This development also holds potential ramifications for other cryptocurrencies, as the SEC&#8217;s stance on where the line between security and non-security lies becomes a subject of litigation. Ethereum Paradigm Shift According to Bloomberg’s report, sources familiar with the matter claim the SEC is unlikely to block the ETFs based on futures contracts for Ethereum, which is currently the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.  Related Reading: More Blood Ahead? Why Bitcoin Could Crash Further If It Loses $26,000 Nearly a dozen companies, including prominent names like Volatility Shares, Bitwise, Roundhill, and ProShares, have filed applications to launch these ETFs. While it remains unclear which funds will receive approval, insiders suggest that several may be granted the green light as early as October. This anticipated approval of an Ethereum futures ETF by the SEC could have far-reaching implications for the regulatory treatment of cryptocurrencies.  The SEC&#8217;s reluctance to approve ETFs directly tied to cryptocurrencies has spurred speculation that derivative-based products would offer a potential pathway to market access.  On this matter, crypto analyst Adam Cochran has highlighted that the SEC potentially approving an ETF based on Ethereum futures contracts implicitly acknowledges that Ethereum itself is not considered a security.  This decision challenges the notion that Ethereum should be regulated as a traditional financial security, considering its proof-of-stake mechanism, purpose, and usage. Cochran further believes that the SEC&#8217;s approval of an Ethereum futures ETF bolsters Ethereum&#8217;s non-security status and sets a precedent that could impact other cryptocurrencies facing regulatory scrutiny.  The ongoing legal battle between the SEC and Grayscale Investments over rejecting their Bitcoin trust&#8217;s conversion into an ETF highlights the agency&#8217;s concerns regarding investor protection, manipulation risks, and price volatility.  However, this approval could provide a compelling argument in favor of distinguishing between the underlying asset and how it is sold, bolstering the Torres Doctrine and potentially influencing the outcome of similar cases, such as the XRP appeal. The SEC&#8217;s approval of an Ethereum futures ETF holds tremendous significance for the cryptocurrency industry. If confirmed, it would mark a pivotal moment for Ethereum&#8217;s classification as a non-security, further solidifying its position as a commodity or currency.  Related Reading: Shibarium Launch Saga: Block Production Resumes Despite Stuck ETH The decision also highlights the regulatory challenge of defining clear boundaries between securities and non-securities in crypto.  As the industry evolves, approving an Ethereum futures ETF could shape the regulatory landscape, paving the way for increased adoption and investment opportunities in the cryptocurrency market. However, the news is not entirely favorable for ETH as it trades at $1,660, following a downward trend similar to Bitcoin and the overall cryptocurrency market. The market has experienced a substantial outflow of liquidity, leading to a significant decline in most digital currencies. Over the past 24 hours, ETH has declined more than 4% after breaking its previously established range between $1,895 and $1,830. Additionally, it has suffered a notable loss of 10% within the seven-day timeframe. Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In a shocking twist, Bitcoin (BTC), the undisputed king of cryptocurrencies, has plunged to levels not seen since the early days of 2023. The battle-hardened Bitcoin bulls have suffered another crushing defeat, leaving investors on edge, anxiously pondering whether the dreaded sub $20,000 abyss will haunt them again. With relentless uncertainty gripping the market, the burning question lingers: Has Bitcoin truly hit rock bottom, or is BTC in for an even darker descent? Bitcoin Path Aligned With 1930 Stock Market Crash According to Mike McGlone, Bloomberg&#8217;s Senior Macro Strategist, Bitcoin&#8217;s current trajectory bears an uncanny resemblance to the US stock market crash of 1930.  In his analysis, McGlone highlights the clear rollover pattern and downward trend evident in Bitcoin&#8217;s 100-week moving average (MA) graphic.  The implications of this pattern, combined with the fundamental principle of “not going against” the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the potential for reversion of one of history&#8217;s best-performing assets, warrant serious consideration. Related Reading: Valkyrie Taps Into Ethereum Momentum With New ETF Filing Adding to the potential headwinds for Bitcoin, US Treasury two-year notes yield nearly 5%, marking a historic high in the crypto realm. Bitcoin, born in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and during a period of highly low-interest rates, may now be facing an extended period of retracement. According to Mcglone, in an era of near-zero and negative interest rates, the allure of a digital equivalent to gold can be captivating. However, the landscape is shifting as the world&#8217;s safest securities offer approximately 10% total return over two years. This shift may pressure the prices of riskier assets, including Bitcoin. The significance of the US Treasury two-year note&#8217;s approximate 5% yield has historical parallels. It harkens back to before the financial crisis and the birth of Bitcoin. This correlation suggests potential headwinds for most risk assets.  McGlone&#8217;s analysis, focusing on the 100-week moving averages, reinforces the prevailing downward biases observed in Bitcoin, particularly when compared to the steepest Treasury yield competition witnessed in almost two decades. Analyst Warns Of Potential Sub-$20,000 Levels Bitcoin&#8217;s recent price trajectory has left many investors uncertain about its future, with some analysts drawing parallels to historical price crashes. Material Indicators co-founder Keith Alan has shared insights on the current market conditions. Since the beginning of the bear market, Alan has been closely monitoring Bitcoin&#8217;s price movements and sharing a chart that suggests the potential for retesting sub-$20,000 levels.  While acknowledging the possibility of short-term scalping opportunities, Alan advises caution and limited exposure to preserve capital for what he believes could be a generational buying opportunity. Notably, Alan emphasizes that he does not believe the bottom has been reached for Bitcoin.  The chart highlights various downrange levels, showcasing Alan&#8217;s belief in the potential for further downside movement.  As depicted in Alan&#8217;s chart, the Bitcoin market faces a critical juncture where the strength of support at $25,000 is crucial for the bullish case in the near term. Failure to hold this level could lead to a revisit of the December 2017 bull market peak at $19,800. Adding to concerns for Bitcoin, there is the possibility of continuing the downside momentum, potentially reaching a four-year low around the June 2019 bull market top of $13,800. This scenario would catch many bulls off guard, especially considering the prevailing belief throughout 2023 that the crypto winter was ending.

					<description><![CDATA[Algorand&#8217;s (ALGO) performance on the charts has been nothing short of a rollercoaster. According to data from CoinGecko, yesterday, the asset&#8217;s value plummeted to a historical bottom, and it&#8217;s currently down by nearly 10% in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Algorand Delivers Lightning-Fast Transaction Finality With Major Protocol Upgrade Algorand Records New Low Just yesterday, amid the significant downturn in the crypto market, Algorand&#8217;s price fell below notable support. The asset dropped to a price of $0.0905 despite maintaining its stability and striving to hold its ground above the $0.11 mark over the past week. This price move resulted in more than $50 million being wiped away from the asset&#8217;s market capitalization in the past day. Algorand&#8217;s market cap stands at a valuation of $755 million, a 7.1% drop from its earlier record of $808 million on Thursday. Despite the bloodbath the asset&#8217;s market cap and price currently suffer, its trading volume has moved in the opposite direction. ALGO&#8217;s trading volume has surged from a low of $46.5 million yesterday to as high as sitting above $73 million at the time of writing. This isn&#8217;t surprising as it indicates a potential violent sell-off. Furthermore, it is worth noting that before ALGO&#8217;s current bloodbath, the US Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman once recognized Algorand as a &#8220;great technology.&#8221; At least on Algorand, I agree with Gary. Gensler is bullish on Algorand!😅 pic.twitter.com/BnKkU8d8gS — Mr. Huber🔥🦅🔥 (@Leerzeit) November 14, 2021 However, despite receiving positive reviews, even from the SEC, the asset eventually became entangled in legal disputes, leading to its inability to maintain stability and ultimately hitting a historic low. Legal Complications Taking A Toll? Besides ALGO&#8217;s price action, the last few months have been tumultuous for Algorand. Two lawsuits have cast long shadows over its progress. In its suit against the cryptocurrency exchange Bittrex in April, the SEC hinted that ALGO is a security under US laws. This classification opened Pandora&#8217;s box of regulatory challenges for Algorand, impacting its perception among investors. Further complicating matters for Algorand was another SEC lawsuit aimed at the behemoth crypto exchange, Binance, in June 2023. This litigation mentioned ALGO, exacerbating its woes and dragging it to its recent historically low prices. Related Reading: Algorand (ALGO) Price Turns Positive, Bulls Eyeing Further Gains? When reviewing a potential cause for ALGO&#8217;s bearish moves in the past months, both of these high-profile legal disputes within a short time frame could be considered one of the reasons, as external factors such as regulatory challenges can significantly sway investor sentiment.

<p>However, despite receiving positive reviews, even from the SEC, the asset eventually became entangled in legal disputes, leading to its inability to maintain stability and ultimately hitting a historic low.</p>
<h2>Legal Complications Taking A Toll?</h2>
<p>Besides ALGO&#8217;s price action, the last few months have been tumultuous for Algorand. Two lawsuits have cast long shadows over its progress. In its suit against the cryptocurrency exchange Bittrex in April, the SEC <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2023/comp-pr2023-78.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">hinted</a> that ALGO is a security under US laws.</p>
<p class="selectable-text copyable-text iq0m558w g0rxnol2" dir="ltr">This classification opened Pandora&#8217;s box of regulatory challenges for Algorand, impacting its perception among investors.</p>
<p class="selectable-text copyable-text iq0m558w g0rxnol2" dir="ltr">Further complicating matters for Algorand was another SEC lawsuit aimed at the behemoth crypto exchange, Binance, in June 2023. This litigation <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.256060/gov.uscourts.dcd.256060.1.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">mentioned</a> ALGO, exacerbating its woes and dragging it to its recent historically low prices.</p>

<p dir="ltr">When reviewing a potential cause for <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/algorand-rises-30-as-founder-sneaks-into-list-of-personalities-to-watch-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">ALGO&#8217;s</a> bearish moves in the past months, both of these high-profile legal disputes within a short time frame could be considered one of the reasons, as external factors such as regulatory challenges can significantly sway investor sentiment.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has reopened old wounds after a federal Judge grants the regulator’s request to file a new appeal against Ripple.   Ripple And SEC Legal Battle Continues Ripple, the crypto firm behind XRP cryptocurrency, had secured a partial victory in July in its case against the SEC that had raged on for almost three years. However, the regulator has not taken this lying down as on Thursday, August 17, Judge Analisa Torres reportedly gave official approval to the SEC’s motion to file an interlocutory appeal against XRP cryptocurrency.  Related Reading: Here Are The Factors That Could Be Behind The Latest Bitcoin Wipeout According to the court proceedings, the SEC will file its motion in court from Friday, August 18 until Friday, September 1. This gives the regulator the opportunity and ample time to develop and provide a compelling argument for its allegations of XRP being a security.  This is because the appeal will be focused on the judge’s decision on Ripple’s programmatic sales and direct sales and offerings of XRP tokens as a trade for goods and services.  The new filing is not an official approval of an appeal by the judge but a gateway for the SEC to file its motion. But regardless, this new development could be bad for Ripple who recently celebrated Judge Torres’ declaration that secondary sales of XRP did not count as a security.  Ripple’s Chief Executive Officer, Brad Garlinghouse, and Chief Learning Officer, Stuart Alderoty have addressed the SEC’s decision to put forward an appeal motion. They publicly opposed the SEC’s interlocutory appeal, detailing that the Judge’s ruling on July 13 refutes any allegations the SEC may harbor of XRP being a security.  “We oppose the SEC’s request for an interlocutory appeal. There is no extraordinary circumstance here that would justify departing from the rule requiring all issues as to all parties to be resolved before an appeal,” Alderoty stated in a Twitter post.  On his part, CEO Brad Garlinghouse commented:  Reminder &#8211; the request for appeal (even if granted) doesn’t change the fact that XRP is not a security. That’s not up for debate/trial. But the SEC continues to claim that Chris and I acted recklessly in believing that XRP is not a security. That’s utter nonsense.

These two issues involve controlling questions of law on which there is substantial ground for differences of opinion, as reflected by an intra-district split that has already developed,” the SEC said in its new filing.
