<ul><li>The SEC has agreed to settle insider trading charges filed against a former Coinbase manager and his brother.&nbsp;</li><li>The duo was arrested for insider trading crypto assets last year and was convicted for multiple wire fraud charges.&nbsp;</li><li>The settlement has left unanswered the question of whether the nine crypto tokens involved in the case were securities.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has agreed to settle the insider trading charges filed against former Coinbase Manager Ishan Wahi and his brother Nikhil Wahi in the infamous crypto insider trading case from last year. The Wahi brothers were arrested for profiting from an insider trading scheme using material insider information from the American crypto exchange.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Wahis To Return Ill Gotten Gains From Coinbase</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-98" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> from the SEC, the securities regulator and the Wahi brothers have agreed to settle the charges related to the insider trading scheme involving the listing of nine crypto tokens on Coinbase. Both the accused have agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the Securities Exchange Act and return the ill-gotten gains from the crypto exchange, as well as the prejudgement interest. If approved by the Manhattan Federal Court, the SEC will not seek civil penalties against Ishan and Nikhil Wahi in light of their prison sentences. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The federal securities laws do not exempt crypto asset securities from the prohibition against insider trading, nor does the SEC. I am grateful to the SEC staff for successfully working to resolve this matter.” </p><cite>Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement</cite></blockquote>



<p>The settlement between the securities regulator and the Wahi brothers brings the controversial court case to an end. The SEC claimed in its initial complaint that the nine crypto tokens involved in the case were securities. The settlement would leave the question regarding the tokens’ security status unanswered. Ishan Wahi was <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-manager-2-years-insider-trading/">sentenced</a> to two years in prison earlier this month. His brother is currently serving a 10-month prison sentence. The brothers were ordered to forfeit more than $920,000 obtained from their insider trading scheme. </p>

<p>Prosecutors handling the case against <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/shaquille-oneal-served-ftx-lawsuit-again/">FTX’s</a> disgraced founder Sam Bankman-Fried have stated that they may drop some of the criminal charges filed against him. In a recent filing with the Manhattan Federal Court, U.S. prosecutors stated that they would not pursue some criminal counts if they violated the terms of Bankman-Fried’s extradition from the Bahamas. </p>



<h2><strong>FTX Prosecutors Will Drop Charges If The Bahamas Objects</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sam-bankman-fried-could-have-some-charges-dropped-if-bahamas-objects-f3c22fce" rel="noopener">WSJ</a>, the United States Department of Justice stated in the court filing that it would drop the three additional criminal charges that were added to Sam Bankman-Fried’s criminal counts after his extradition from The Bahamas in December last year. The court filing was to express the U.S. government’s opposition to SBF’s motion to dismiss the criminal charges based on the rule of specialty. </p>



<p>Specialty is a principle of international law, which provides that a person who is extradited can be prosecuted or sentenced for the offense(s) for which extradition was granted and not for any other crime committed before extradition took place. Lawyers representing Bankman-Fried requested District Judge Lewis to dismiss the charges filed after the FTX founder’s extradition, which included conspiracy to commit bank fraud and conspiracy to bribe a Chinese official.</p>



<p>The Justice Department urged Judge Kaplan to deny SBF’s motion, describing it as “meritless”. However, the prosecutors stated that they would drop the additional charges if the Bahamas were to deem them a violation of Bankman-Fried’s extradition terms. The federal prosecutors are awaiting approval from the Bahamian government to proceed with the new criminal charges.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The government will proceed on the new charges…if The Bahamas consents to trial on these charges, and will not proceed on those counts if The Bahamas denies the Government’s request”</p><cite>Federal Prosecutors</cite></blockquote>

<ul><li>Binance is exploring a plan to allow some of its traders to keep their trading collateral at a bank.&nbsp;</li><li>The crypto exchange is considering this new step to reduce counterparty risk.</li><li>This facility would be made available to institutional clients for margin trading in spot and derivatives.&nbsp;</li><li>Switzerland’s FlowBank and Liechtenstein&#8217;s Bank Frick are reportedly being considered to facilitate this service.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The world’s largest crypto exchange is reportedly considering allowing some of its traders to store their trading collateral at a bank rather than on the crypto trading platform. Binance’s latest proposal would see traditional banking institutions hold the collateral in order to help reduce the counterparty risk. Two European banks are currently being considered as the institution that would help facilitate the safekeeping of the trading collateral.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Binance Would Lend Stablecoins In Exchange For Clients’ Cash</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-30/binance-may-let-some-clients-keep-trading-collateral-in-bank-accounts#xj4y7vzkg" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, Binance has been in contact with its institutional clients regarding its proposal to allow bank deposits to be used as collateral for margin trading in spot and derivatives. People familiar with the matter revealed that Swiss-based FlowBank and Liechtenstein-based Bank Frick have been tapped as potential intermediaries to help provide this service to the crypto exchange’s customers. It is unclear if the service will be extended to retail traders. </p>



<p>Bloomberg’s request for comment was reportedly denied by a Binance spokesperson. Liechtenstein’s Bank Frick also declined to comment on the matter, citing bank secrecy laws. Switzerland’s FlowBank did not comment on any arrangements with Binance but stated that its banking license didn’t include crypto trading. As per one version of Binance’s proposal, the cash deposits of clients at the bank would be locked up through a tri-party arrangement. The crypto exchange would then lend stablecoins to the clients, which would serve as collateral for margin trading on the platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-invest-banks-pro-crypto-policies/">Binance’s</a> latest plan comes amid increasing scrutiny from clients that are worried about the safety of their funds in the event of the platform’s collapse. The bank deposit feature may help the crypto exchange regain some of the market share it lost this year. Crypto custody has become a major concern in light of the recent bankruptcies and scandals in the crypto industry. Nasdaq Inc, Bank of New York Mellon Corp., and Fidelity Investments are reportedly offering or building crypto custody solutions for institutions.</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Tether plans to tap into Uruguay&#8217;s renewable energy ecosystem and mine Bitcoin (BTC), crypto&#8217;s largest token by market cap.</li><li>The digital payment company is looking to diversify its operations after solidifying USDT&#8217;s position as the top stablecoin with an 83 billion token supply.</li><li>Tether recently started buying Bitcoin with 15% of net realized profits and holds over $1.5 billion in BTC.</li></ul>



<p>Tether, the company that issues crypto&#8217;s largest stablecoin USDT, <a href="https://tether.to/en/tether-invests-in-energy-production-and-sustainable-bitcoin-mining-in-uruguay/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://tether.to/en/tether-invests-in-energy-production-and-sustainable-bitcoin-mining-in-uruguay/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced</a> plans to mine Bitcoin (BTC) in Uruguay using renewable and sustainable energy. </p>



<p>The Company&#8217;s CTO Paolo Ardoino said the Bitcoin mining operation in the South American region will combine &#8220;cutting-edge technology, sustainable practices, and financial innovation.&#8221; Tether&#8217;s plan works in partnership with a locally regulated company yet to be disclosed. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>By harnessing the power of Bitcoin and Uruguay&#8217;s renewable energy capabilities, Tether is leading the way in sustainable and responsible Bitcoin mining. Our unwavering commitment to renewable energy ensures that every Bitcoin we mine leaves a minimal ecological footprint while upholding the security and integrity of the Bitcoin network.</p></blockquote>



<p>Uruguay is a leader in the renewable energy market, generating 94% of its power supply through wind farms, solar parks, and hydropower projects. The USDT issuer believes that Uruguay offers the modern infrastructure needed to sustainably mine BTC.</p>



<p>Today&#8217;s decision also comes at a time when mining is more profitable due to increased activity on the BTC network spurred by <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bitcoin-inscription-ordinals-sold-35btc/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bitcoin-inscription-ordinals-sold-35btc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">memecoins and Ordinals</a>.</p>



<h2>Tether&#8217;s BTC Bag And Stablecoin Dominance</h2>



<p>Tether&#8217;s Bitcoin mining plans follow the company&#8217;s announcement about buying Bitcoin for its stablecoin reserves. According to the issuer, 15% of net realized profits will go towards purchasing more Bitcoins. The company also <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/tether-usdt-integrated-strike-bitcoin/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/tether-usdt-integrated-strike-bitcoin/" rel="noreferrer noopener">integrated</a> with Bitcoin lightning payment app Strike. </p>



<p>Already the company boasts over $1.5 billion in its BTC portfolio along with other assets like gold and treasury bills. This makes USDT&#8217;s issuer one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin but its holdings remain distant from MicroStrategy&#8217;s BTC coffers worth over $4.4 billion. </p>



<p>USDT&#8217;s dominance over the stablecoin market is strengthened following a U.S. banking crisis and enforcement actions that shook rivals like USDC. Tether&#8217;s coin has the highest stablecoin supply in the market with over 83 billion tokens market cap. </p>

<ul><li>The Russian government has abandoned the plan to launch a national cryptocurrency exchange. </li><li>The country will instead establish a regulatory regime for crypto trading platforms. </li><li>Russian authorities intend to use the country’s crypto exchange to facilitate cross-border transactions. </li><li>The country&#8217;s Central Bank will likely be in charge of regulating the crypto exchanges. </li></ul>



<p>Russia’s ambitious plan to establish a national cryptocurrency exchange has come to an end just six months after it was initially unveiled. The government instead plans to set up a regulatory infrastructure to oversee the development and operations of the country’s crypto trading platforms. The authorities aim to reduce the risk of inviting further <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/us-ukraine-russian-crypto-sanction-evader/">sanctions</a> while promoting competition in the crypto market.</p>



<h2><strong>Russia Will Use Crypto Exchanges For Cross-Border Settlements</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://iz.ru/1519017/mariia-kolobova/novyi-bitok-v-rossii-poiaviatsia-pravila-sozdaniia-i-raboty-kriptobirzh" rel="nofollow noopener">Izvestia</a>, the Russian government has abandoned a plan to create a national crypto exchange in favor of healthy competition in the market. Anatoly Aksakov, Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Financial Markets, told Izvestia that the government is now planning to set up a regulatory regime to regulate the country’s crypto exchanges. This would allow local businesses to settle cross-border transactions. Chairman Aksakov added that the new plan would also help local businesses to avoid the sanctions placed against the country. </p>



<p>Russia’s Ministry of Finance is reportedly on board with the revised plan to regulate the country’s crypto trading platforms. Ivan Chebeskov, Director of the Finance Ministry’s Financial Policy Department, told Izvestia that the Ministry was never keen on the idea of setting up a national crypto exchange. The Ministry is reportedly in favor of legally regulating such platforms. The Central Bank of the Russian Federation will likely regulate the country’s crypto trading platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Russian authorities are hoping to foster the growth and development of new crypto exchanges through the revised regulatory policy for the crypto industry. It would also help minimize the risks of sanctions and infrastructure cyberattacks. The government’s decision to drop the national crypto exchange plan was welcomed by major crypto firms in the country. The plan received considerable opposition ever since it was unveiled in November last year. </p>

<ul><li>Binance is looking to invest in banks and become a minority investor in traditional financial institutions.&nbsp;</li><li>CEO Changpeng Zhao aims to encourage the banks towards crypto-friendly policies.&nbsp;</li><li>Binance stated last year that it may spend over $1 billion on deals in 2023, including a potential bank acquisition.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The world’s largest crypto exchange is looking to pour funds into the traditional finance sector. Binance CEO <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-us-cut-cz-stake-in-the-exchange/">Changpeng Zhao</a> stated earlier today that his company may become a minority investor in banks through cash investments, in a bid to inspire the banks to take a friendlier stance towards crypto and adopt pro-crypto policies. </p>



<h2><strong>Binance Considered Acquiring A Bank</strong></h2>



<p>Changpeng Zhao, the founder of Binance, appeared in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1mKwAxwAJ0" rel="nofollow noopener">Bankless</a> podcast earlier today. The crypto billionaire reflected on several topics including the fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) surrounding his crypto exchange, the collapse of FTX, the regulatory landscape in the United States, and the future roadmap for his company. Speaking on the FUD around his crypto exchange, Zhao stated that the sheer size of the company made it an easy target for news agencies that aim to attract clicks and generate buzz by publishing negative stories. </p>



<p>When asked about plans to buy a bank in order to make it crypto-friendly, Changpeng Zhao revealed that his company looked into that option and did consider acquiring a TradFi bank. However, his company realized that the logistics and formalities would make it an unfeasible approach. Zhao revealed that buying a bank would still require it to comply with the regulatory policy of that jurisdiction. Additionally, the corresponding banks in the jurisdiction and abroad may choose to not interact with a crypto-friendly bank.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the Binance Chief stated that his company may make small investments in a few banks and become minority investors, in a bid to guide their management towards becoming more crypto-friendly and having pro-crypto policies. Zhao added that such a move wouldn’t guarantee a friendlier stance from the bank towards the crypto industry. Another concern that he pointed out was the business model that banks run on. According to Zhao, banks are risky businesses that don&#8217;t run on profitable and sound business models. Bloomberg reported last year that Binance is looking to pour in over $1 billion on deals in 2023, with a considerable portion potentially going toward the acquisition of a bank.</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Gemini and Genesis moved to throw out a lawsuit built on securities violation claims made by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.</li><li>In January, the U.S. watchdog filed a suit arguing that Gemini and Genesis offered unregistered securities and ignored investor protection procedures.</li><li>Crypto exchange Gemini filed that the regulator&#8217;s view of a tri-party MDALA contract between the digital asset entities and Earn Users &#8220;has no basis in law or fact.&#8221;</li></ul>



<p>Gemini and Genesis filed to throw out a <a href="http://chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.592343/gov.uscourts.nysd.592343.30.0.pdf" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.592343/gov.uscourts.nysd.592343.30.0.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">lawsuit</a> claiming securities law violations submitted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in connection to an Earn Program offered by the Winklevoss-founded crypto exchange. </p>



<p>In January, the commission wrote that Gemini and bankrupt <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/digital-currency-group-refinance-debt/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/digital-currency-group-refinance-debt/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Genesis</a> raised billions from investors who tapped into Gemini&#8217;s Earn product. Earn boasted hundreds of thousands of users who had access to crypto borrowing and lending facilities. </p>



<p>At the time, <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/gemini-genesis-winklevoss-dcg-lawsuit/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/gemini-genesis-winklevoss-dcg-lawsuit/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gemini</a> co-founder Tyler Winklevoss called the suit a &#8220;manufactured parking ticket&#8221; while lawyers from both the crypto exchange and Genesis filed that the suit &#8220;has no basis in law or fact.&#8221;</p>



<p>According to the U.S. watchdog, Gemini did not register Earn in line with securities laws before offering the product to investors. The suit further argued that Genesis, one of the sides in a tri-party agreement, deployed client funds toward revenue generation strategies. Genesis also directed part of this revenue to Earn subscribers in the form of interest, a business model that must be cleared by regulators per the commission&#8217;s stand.</p>



<p>The filing from the watchdog insisted that Gemini and Genesis failed to protect investors by not providing proper disclosure regarding Earn. </p>



<h2>SEC, U.S. Regulators Tighten Grip On Crypto Enforcement</h2>



<p>Gemini and Genesis are two entities in a growing list of companies under pressure from U.S. regulators. Kraken was forced to shut down its staking service for American customers supposedly for breaking local law. The exchange also paid a $30 million fine but did not admit to any violations. </p>



<p>Paxos and Binance were also subjects of lawsuits and enforcement actions as regulators across the U.S. crackdown on allegedly illegal players. The <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-continue-enforcement-action-coinbase/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-continue-enforcement-action-coinbase/" rel="noreferrer noopener">uncertainty</a> surrounding regulations in America has now galvanized entities like <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-engage-uae-lawmakers/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-engage-uae-lawmakers/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a> to seek offshore options. </p>

<p>The world’s largest crypto exchange has secured the necessary regulatory approvals to set up operations in Thailand. The Thai Ministry of Finance has granted digital asset operator licenses to <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-reuters-commingling-user-funds/">Binance</a> and its partner Gulf Energy, paving the way for the establishment of a new crypto exchange in Thailand by the fourth quarter of 2023. </p>



<h2><strong>Gulf Binance To Launch SEC Complaint Crypto Exchange</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://cryptotale.org/binance-launches-crypto-exchange-in-thailand-by-q42023-secures-licenses/" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> from Binance, Gulf Binance, the joint venture between Gulf Energy’s innovation subsidiary Gulf Innova and the crypto giant, received the green flag from Thailand’s Finance Ministry to set up a digital asset exchange regulated by the country’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The exchange will reportedly go live between October and December 2023. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>By harnessing Binance&#8217;s expertise together with Gulf’s established local presence and network, Gulf Binance aims to showcase the full potential of blockchain technology to meet the needs of Thai users.

<p>The joint venture will see Binance contribute its extensive expertise in the digital asset space and Gulf contributing its local industry knowledge and established presence in Thailand. Gulf Binance is aiming to leverage the partnership to create a digital asset exchange and digital asset broker compliant with local regulatory guidelines in order to maximize value for its Thai users. The joint venture eventually plans to become the leading provider of infrastructure services for the digital asset ecosystem in Thailand.

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>A Lawyer for Coinone’s former Listing Director Mr. Jeon and his broker Mr Ko responded to bribery charges during a hearing on Thursday.</li><li>South Korean prosecutors claim Mr. Jeon took $1.51 million in bribes for exclusively listing “Furiever Coin” on the crypto exchange Coinone.</li><li>The token is tied to a murder investigation in Gangnam, a district in the capital Seoul.</li><li>Mr. Jeon’s attorney said the defense will provide a final opinion after reviewing all available evidence.</li></ul>



<p>&#8220;Mr. Jeon&#8221;, the former director of listing at crypto exchange Coinone, formally recognized bribery charges against him and his broker &#8220;Mr. Ko&#8221; during a South Korean court hearing on May 25.</p>



<p>&#8220;I admit the facts of the prosecution.&#8221; an attorney for the former Coinone exec said at a hearing, reports from <a href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20230525091000004?section=economy/cryptocurrency" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20230525091000004?section=economy/cryptocurrency" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Yonhap News</a> reported. </p>



<p>The admission does not necessarily mean a guilty plea. Rather it serves as an acknowledgment of the charges and claims made by South Korean prosecutors. Mr. Jeon&#8217;s attorney said a final opinion will be communicated to the court after all available evidence is reviewed. </p>



<h2>Coinone Crypto Listing Scandal</h2>



<p>The former head of Coinone&#8217;s listing machinery is accused of accepting around $1.51 million or 2 billion won for exclusively listing a cryptocurrency &#8211; Furiever Coin. Prosecutors named Furiever Coin as a point of interest in a murder investigation following a kidnapping in Gangnam, &nbsp;a district in the capital city of Seoul. </p>



<p>A broke identified as Mr.Ko is said to be involved in the deal and the cheat listing that followed. Mr. Ko is also facing charges in a South Korean court alongside Coinone&#8217;s former director of listing. </p>
