			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Polygon, the renowned Ethereum scaling solution, recently proposed a new decentralized governance model aimed at enhancing its network's security, upgradeability, and robustness.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This proposal, revolving around the establishment of an "Ecosystem Council," will redefine how system smart contracts within the Polygon environment are managed and upgraded. This proposal indicates the continuous efforts by Polygon to strike a perfect balance between community-driven governance and efficient decision-making in a decentralized network.</p>
A New System for Decentralized Governance
<p class="md-end-block md-p">System smart contracts represent a fundamental element of the blockchain infrastructure. They can directly or indirectly influence user funds and the infrastructure's functioning. A crucial aspect of these contracts is their upgradeability, which allows seamless migration to improved versions under specific circumstances. The importance of this feature is evident in various Layer 2 (L2) solutions, such as Optimism, Arbitrum, and zkSync, where an efficient means of patching bugs and upgrading pivotal architecture components is required.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">According to the proposal, the Ecosystem Council would comprise technically proficient and value-aligned individuals, elected and removable by the community. This council will be responsible for performing timelock-limited upgrades to system smart contracts across Polygon networks, such as Polygon PoS and zkEVM.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">For example, in the case of non-emergency or routine proposals, the council will make a proposal and proceed with the timelock as usual. On the other hand, if there is a perceived threat to user funds due to potential vulnerabilities in smart contracts, the council will enact an Emergency State, freezing transactions to protect assets. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Polygon community will be empowered with three competencies: the election and removal of Ecosystem Council members, the ability to exit an Emergency State, and the power to veto any upgrade proposed by the Ecosystem Council. This model is expected to increase community engagement while retaining a level of control to prevent malicious activities.</p>
The Ecosystem Council: Balancing Efficiency and Decentralization
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The proposed model suggests the creation of an Ecosystem Council, a group consisting of reputable, technically adept, and value-aligned individuals. These individuals would be democratically elected by the community and could also be removed by them. The council's primary role would be to perform timelock-limited upgrades to the system's smart contracts across the Polygon networks, including the Polygon PoS and zkEVM.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The governance model will allow the council to handle both routine and sensitive proposals. In the case of routine proposals, the council will make a proposal and proceed with the standard timelock protocol. However, if a potential vulnerability poses a risk to user funds, the council will enact an Emergency State, freezing transactions to protect the funds. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">To maintain a balance between efficiency and community engagement, Polygon proposes empowering the community with several competencies. These include the power to elect and remove Ecosystem Council members, the ability to exit the Emergency State, and the authority to veto any upgrade proposed and scheduled by the Ecosystem Council. By bestowing the community with these powers, Polygon hopes to increase the overall community engagement while maintaining a level of centralized control to prevent malicious activities.</p>
Navigating the Transition: Inviting Community Input
<p class="md-end-block md-p">While the proposed model promises improved governance and security, its rollout must be gradual and well planned, especially considering the live nature of the blockchain. To ensure a seamless transition, the Polygon team is inviting its community to participate in the process, providing feedback, and assisting in answering open questions.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The community is particularly encouraged to contribute ideas regarding incentivizing participation in the model and establishing a robust and secure voting mechanism. Decisions around these aspects, like the general design principles, voting power proxy, and architecture, will be crucial to the model's success. The team is also considering the use of the $MATIC token as a voting power proxy, which would provide broad ecosystem inclusion and legitimize the Ecosystem Council.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Polygon's proposed Ecosystem Council represents an exciting step towards more robust, efficient, and community-driven governance of system smart contracts. By integrating elements of both centralized and decentralized decision-making, the model aims to bring the best of both worlds to the Polygon network. This move could help Polygon maintain its reputation as a leading Layer 2 solution, offering an improved governance framework that values efficiency, security, and community inclusion.</p>

			  <guid isPermaLink="false">https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/tether-responds-to-account-deactivation-controversy</guid>
			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">According to information released by the New York Attorney General (NYAG), Tether, the issuer of leading stablecoin USDT, reportedly deactivated around 29 accounts tied to significant players in the cryptocurrency sphere in 2021.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">While reasons for the individual account terminations remain undisclosed, the named entities included MoonPay, BlockFi, CMS Holdings, and Galois Capital.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Responding to the unfolding situation, Tether indicated its reluctance to comment on specific customer relationships, noting that each party had undergone stringent compliance checks both during onboarding and throughout their relationship, in line with Tether's compliance policies.</p>
NYAG Investigation and Tether's Commitment to Transparency
<p class="md-end-block md-p">While the NYAG investigation wrapped up in early 2021, some of the documents in question extend until June of that year. These documents were collected during the NYAG's probe into Tether and sister company Bitfinex over the alleged misappropriation of $850 million. During this investigation, iFinex, the parent company of both entities, requested an extension to produce the required financial documents.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Following a settlement that included an $18.5 million penalty and the cessation of trading in New York, media outlets and Coinbase sought the public disclosure of Tether&rsquo;s initial quarterly report under the Freedom of Information Act. However, Tether opposed this motion, citing the need to protect its customers' confidential data.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Despite Tether's objections, the NYAG granted media outlets access to the documents, leading to the revelation about the deacttivation of numerous company accounts. </p>
Tether's Stance on Transparency and Risk Management
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Tether remains adamant about its commitment to transparency while prioritizing its customers' privacy and security. Following the settlement with the NYAG, Tether has diligently completed its quarterly reporting obligations, affirming its commitment to openness and transparency.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Notably, Tether claims that it takes pride in its meticulous development of risk metrics and processes, enabling its investment and financial teams to thoroughly assess the risk tied to the company's financial interactions. Tether has continually demonstrated its commitment to sustaining its business objectives while adhering to a robust risk management culture.</p>
Tether's Reserves and Commercial Papers
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Tether's dedication to maintaining the highest standards is evident in its transparent dealings regarding its lending program and reserves. Tether's reserves have proven to be extremely liquid, high-quality, and readily available to support any size of redemption, demonstrated by the repayment of US$7 billion in 48 hours in 2022.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">According to the released documents, Tether has consistently maintained an A2 or better rating for the majority of its commercial papers, and none of its past statements have undergone any changes. This commitment to upholding the highest standards has been echoed in the company's dedication to accountability and its unwavering risk management culture. The firm, however, has been severely criticized over past decisions, especially in the case of blocking an MEV Validator as a security response.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Tether says that while media outlets have rushed to present this information to readers, Tether remains committed to its users, as well as for the benefit of the the broader crypto community. The company is keen to provide a factual point of reference about the disclosed materials, and it continues to cooperate with law enforcement, having assisted in over 150 investigations across four continents in the past 18 months. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Uniswap recently disclosed its preferred choice for handling non-Ethereum deployments in its cross-chain bridging operations: Wormhole and Axelar.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">These selections are the result of a comprehensive analysis conducted by Uniswap's Bridge Assessment Committee, which evaluated a range of potential protocols. The proposed changes are also aligned to the protocol's recent disclosure of its plans for V4.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Diving Deep into the Decision</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Uniswap's Bridge Assessment Committee scrutinized multiple contenders, namely Wormhole, Celer, DeBridge, LayerZero, Axelar, and Multichain (CRP). Each of these was rigorously assessed for its proficiency in facilitating cross-chain governance. Out of the competition, Wormhole and Axelar emerged victorious, with the committee endorsing these two for utilization across all cross-chain deployments.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">As the committee puts it, both Wormhole and Axelar have demonstrated their aptness in managing governance messaging for potential cross-chain deployments. They, however, advised the community to persistently review these and other bridge providers, bearing in mind the dynamics of the industry.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Cross-Chain Governance and Its Implications</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The fundamental application for Uniswap DAO's cross-chain bridge lies in its ability to relay governance messages from Ethereum to other chains for execution. All Uniswap deployment proposals undertake a formal voting procedure on Ethereum. Any upgrades for deployments on alternate chains are then communicated via a cross-chain messaging protocol.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">While Wormhole and Axelar have gained the committee's approval, this doesn't entirely exclude other bridges. The report also pointed out that those deemed unsuitable for Uniswap's present cross-chain governance needs might still satisfy the prerequisites of other protocols and applications.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Vulnerabilities and Controversies: The Story of Cross-Chain Bridges</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The controversy around cross-chain bridges in the Web3 sphere is nothing new. In 2022, these bridging protocols proved to be a weak spot, with hackers successfully exploiting them and causing billions in losses. As per data from Rekt, four out of the top five most expensive DeFi breaches targeted bridges, resulting in an aggregated loss of over $2.1 billion.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In response to these vulnerabilities, Uniswap has formed its Cross-Chain Bridge Assessment Committee to aid governance delegates and the Uniswap community in making well-informed decisions regarding cross-chain bridging protocols.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Committee's evaluations covered more than 130 assessment questions for each protocol, taking into account their ability to ensure "safety, liveness, and censorship resistance". Looking ahead, Celer and DeBridge might be reassessed despite their current shortcomings in slashing mechanisms and security assurances. The report was notably critical of Multichain for its lack of transparency and ineffective deterrents to prevent validator collusion.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">To underscore the context, Uniswap has over $5.9 billion locked in its protocol as of May 2023, with daily transaction volume frequently exceeding $1 billion. Given these figures, Uniswap's choice of Wormhole and Axelar could have significant implications for both the involved protocols and Uniswap's ongoing cross-chain operations.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">To underscore the context, Uniswap has over $5.9 billion locked in its protocol as of May 2023, with daily transaction volume frequently exceeding $1 billion. Given these figures, Uniswap's choice of Wormhole and Axelar could have significant implications for both the involved protocols and Uniswap's ongoing cross-chain operations.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Rumors of Airphoria: A Possible Revolution in the Gaming Industry</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">In a series of June 16 social media posts, Nike teased an event set for June 20, which they termed the "ultimate Sneakerhunt". A promotional video showcased the logos of both Fortnite and Nike's Air Max amidst floating clouds. As the video transitions, it unveils the name of this intriguing venture, 'Airphoria', ending with a display of Nike's Web3 platform .SWOOSH logo alongside that of Epic Games' Unreal Engine.</p>

</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">However, specific details remain elusive. Members of the NFT community have begun to speculate that Nike might have employed Fortnite Creative 2.0, a tool that allows users to craft their own virtual island game maps utilizing Fortnite assets, to devise an NFT-related game.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">A Leap Into Web3 for Nike with .SWOOSH</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This wouldn't be Nike's first foray into gaming. The company has been stepping up its efforts to merge its NFT unit, .SWOOSH, into traditional gaming. Just recently, on June 1, .SWOOSH announced its intention to incorporate its NFTs into games developed by EA Sports, a household name responsible for the incredibly successful FIFA soccer game franchise, among others. Although it's still not confirmed which EA Sports games will incorporate Nike NFTs, this latest hint seems to suggest that Nike's integration into the gaming world might be deeper than previously anticipated.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Although not yet confirmed, the probability of NFTs featuring in Airphoria is high, given .SWOOSH's involvement and Epic Games' known affinity for NFT gaming. If the speculations prove to be true, the move could provide a considerable opportunity for Web3 adoption amongst traditional gamers. Considering Fortnite's impressive player base of over 242.9 million active players in the past 30 days, as reported by Active Player, the potential impact could be monumental.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Nike has previously launched NFT sneakers on Polygon, as well as an earlier collaboration with RTFKT. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>With Blackrock&rsquo;s recent spot ETF application many Bitcoincoiners are elated. However, should they be worried about this particular move by the $10 trillion asset manager?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not heard from any one client looking to buy a cryptocurrency at this time. Right now I can tell you that Worldwide, I have not heard from one client that said I need to be in this.</p>

<p>Larry Fink.</p>
<p>The Blackrock CEO did go on to say back in 2018 that his company would look back into crypto when it became more &ldquo;legitimised&rdquo;. Nearly 5 years later Blackrock is doing exactly that - but with crypto being singled out for extremely rough treatment from the SEC it could hardly be said that crypto has reached the legitimacy stage.</p>
<p>When such a massive and powerful institutional entity as Blackrock files an application for a Bitcoin ETF, when so many have failed, it might be guessed that there will have been some quiet conversations behind the scenes, and that some plan could be in place to exert control over the premier crypto asset.</p>
The Blackrock ESG commitment
<p>Larry Fink has said that he and his company are committed to pushing its ESG agenda.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have to force behaviours, and at Blackrock we are forcing behaviours&rdquo;</p>

<p>With Fink serving as a Trustee on the board of Klaus Schwab&rsquo;s World Economic Forum, you can be sure that this application for a Bitcoin Spot ETF will somehow play along with the ESG narrative.&nbsp;</p>
How Blackrock could potentially take control
<p>An extremely thought-provoking tweet by @anilsaidso posits how Blackrock could in one fail swoop take control of Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">A hidden gem in the BlackRock ETF filing.#GetForked https://t.co/tER6xxZPui pic.twitter.com/Qdt8BZ2OEZ</p>
&mdash; Anil ⚡ (@anilsaidso) June 15, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p>Hidden within the filing is what Blackrock would be able to do in the event of a Bitcoin hard fork. This is explosive beyond belief. Bitcoin has already been through hard forks in its history, and thus far the decentralised nature of Bitcoin has always won through, and forks of the original network have not been successful.</p>
<p>What Blackrock is contemplating in the event of a hard fork is that it would get to choose which fork to go with, thereby deciding the future of Bitcoin. And given its love for the ESG narrative, what if Blackrock itself or one of its &lsquo;associates&rsquo; proposed a PoS fork, and then all the institutions with backing of regulators and governments went with this fork and left the original PoW fork in its wake?</p>
Gold and silver were controlled 
<p>Government and institutions were able to use subterfuge to squash the price of gold and silver over many decades so that they would not detract from the power of the dollar. Big banks used massive short selling whenever the prices took off, and were able to build huge positions in the metals, especially J P Morgan.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is very similar to gold and silver in that it is sound money, meaning that it can&rsquo;t be debased by governments in order to backstop banks or pay for wars. Look for the Blackrock Bitcoin Spot ETF to be approved by an anti-Bitcoin SEC, and then watch what happens very closely.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>San Francisco-based crypto payments firm Wyre has announced that it has begun the process of winding down its operations. It also noted that interested parties could begin inquiries about purchasing the firm&rsquo;s assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The firm cited challenges arising from the prolonged bear market and not due to the regulatory conditions prevailing in the US markets.&nbsp;</p>
Bear Market Claims Another Victim&nbsp;
<p>Wyre announced its decision to shutter operations in a tweet on Friday. The decision comes a few months after Bolt Financial canceled its planned $1.5 billion purchase of the crypto payments firm. Since the cancellation of the purchase, the digital asset markets have seen a number of high-profile bankruptcies, such as FTX, along with lawsuits against prominent exchanges, including Coinbase and Binance, from The United States Securities and Exchange Commission. The company also stressed that the decision was not due to any direction from regulatory agencies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After nearly a decade, Wyre is winding down. Due to market conditions, we made this decision to protect the best interest of our key stakeholders and customers. This decision is not due to any regulatory agency direction. Wyre continues to secure customer assets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wyre also stated that customers have until Friday, 14th July 2023, to withdraw their assets via the Wyre dashboard. If customers miss this date, Wyre has laid down a separate process to enable the recovery of assets left on the platform. According to Wyre&rsquo;s blog post,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wyre continues to secure customer assets. If you have assets on the Wyre platform, you can continue to withdraw them via Wyre&rsquo;s dashboard until Friday, 14th July. After then, we will have a separate process to recover assets remaining on the platform. We will post details on the process on our website and blog.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Wyre team also seemed to suggest that the company&rsquo;s assets were up for sale and that interested parties could inquire about purchasing the firm or its assets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re interested in acquiring Wyre&rsquo;s or its subsidiaries&rsquo; assets, please reach out to 88 Partners.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

Wyre&rsquo;s Troubled Year&nbsp;
<p>Wyre has been in the doldrums since Bolt Financial decided to cancel its planned purchase of the company for $1.5 billion in September 2022. A few months after the failed acquisition, more trouble began for the company as its fiat-to-crypto on-ramp solution provider Juno urged users to withdraw their crypto assets from the Juno platform and self custody them. Given the uncertainty surrounding its custodial partner, Wyre, Juno stated that such a step was necessary.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Juno as a platform doesn&rsquo;t custody crypto assets &amp; relies on our crypto partner for these services. Due to uncertainty with our crypto partner, we have taken preemptive action in the interest of our customers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The very next day, MetaMask also announced that it was ending support of the Wyre platform, citing several reports that the company was planning to shut down. MetaMask announced the news on its official Twitter handle, asking users not to use the Wyre service on the mobile aggregator.&nbsp;</p>
False Dawn&nbsp;
<p>A few days after MetaMask shuttered support for Wyre, the company announced the imposition of a 90% withdrawal limit for all its users. However, this limit was quickly removed following an announcement that Wyre had secured funding from an unnamed strategic partner. However, despite securing funding, Wyre still let go of 75 employees in January 2023. The announcement to mark the firm shutting down operations marks the end of Wyre after the company had explored several strategic options in a bid to stay afloat. The company had stated in January,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We sincerely appreciate the support and positive sentiments from our community as well as the crypto ecosystem at large as we pursue options that will enable Wyre to flourish. Our operations continue, and we will share information with the community as it is available.&rdquo;</p>

A Growing List Of Bear Market Casualties&nbsp;
<p>Wyre is the latest in a growing list of crypto companies and blockchain firms that have buckled under the pressure of an unending bear market. Just in May alone, several firms, including Lightning Network payments platform BottlePay, NFT platform Terressa, crypto exchange HotBit, and Digital Currency Group&rsquo;s institutional trading platform TradeBlock, all shuttered operations thanks to the prolonged crypto winter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>EmpireDAO also ended its tenancy at 190 Bowery in New York, giving further evidence of a market downturn. The crypto-exclusive co-working space was founded by Mike Fraietta, with its office building often touted as the WeWork of Web3. Fraietta stated at the time,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We tried every which way to get new sponsors, partnerships, and even crowdfunding. But we needed more help to sustain at 190 Bowery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On June 9, 2023, Binance coin traded at $259.21 per coin. This represents a lower point of value than the one Binance coin had at the start of the month, but there are factors that could impact its price in the future, including Binance's continued push towards creating new features and products, market demand, and overall regulatory compliance of the exchange.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The price of Binance coin at the end of 2023, according to some piece predictions made for the Binance coin, places it at a value of $465.85.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
The Answers ChatGPT Gave for Bitcoin
<p>The price of Bitcoin as of June 9, 2023, is at $26,607.05. Analysts went to ChatGPT to get accurate predictions about the future of Bitcoin. However, the AI did note that nothing can be predicted with 100% certainty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The key factors that can affect the value of Bitcoin, according to ChatGPT, include the overall momentum of the market, mainstream adoption of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, and the development of new, innovative features on top of the network or the creation of Layer-2 scaling solutions for it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The price of Bitcoin at the end of 2023 could see an increase, however, and based on estimates, BTC is expected to reach $65,000 by the end of the year.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
What ChatGPT Thinks about The Performance of Tradecurve
<p>Investors and traders are also curious about new projects, and Tradecurve has stood out due to its popularity, appeal, and the freedom it provides investors as it does not require KYC checks whilst also having the lowest fees in the industry.</p>
<p>Tradecurve is a hybrid exchange that combines the best elements of CEXs and DEXs to provide a truly unique, decentralized experience that will enable anyone on a global scale access to markets that are otherwise unavailable to them due to banking restrictions or regulations.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Each user of Tradecurve can effectively and effortlessly trade cryptocurrencies, as well as any other derivative, from one account while also maintaining privacy through the platform's DeFi capabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TCRV is the utility token behind the platform, and it is currently undergoing Stage 3 of its presale, where it is offered at $0.015.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When asked about the future of the cryptocurrency, ChatGPT noted how it could climb to 100x at launch, bringing it to $1.5 in value, because of the increased demand for such a solution after heightened regulation of CEXs, and because of the fast sales of the TCRV tokens, where the team has already sold millions of tokens and can generate $20 million before the presale ends.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The popular Bitcoin investor and permabull, Michael Saylor, has released a new prediction for Bitcoin. Saylor has said that under the right conditions, the price of Bitcoin will jump by 10x to set a new trading high at $250,000. In other news, Tradecurve, a new hybrid exchange has outlined plans to overtake Binance as the number one crypto exchange, and some experts believe it is possible.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Michael Saylor has predicted a 10x price jump for Bitcoin, predicting the crypto will trade as high as $250,000 in the next bull run.</li>
<li>According to Saylor, regulatory clarity will be the catalyst for the next bull run.</li>
<li>While Binance suffers due to regulatory clarity, a new hybrid exchange has tapped into markets that could see it overtake the number one crypto exchange.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
Michael Saylor Predicts 10x Price Jump for Bitcoin (BTC)
<p>In an interview with Bloomberg, Michael Saylor, the co-founder of Microstrategy, an enterprise business intelligence provider, predicted that the price of Bitcoin could jump by 10x. In explaining the reasoning for his prediction, Saylor said regulatory clarity in the U.S. will drive the next Bitcoin rally.</p>
<p>The presence of regulatory clarity will encourage venture capitalists that have avoided cryptocurrencies to jump into the industry. He adds that the recent crackdown on many top crypto exchanges by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would lay the groundwork for the next major Bitcoin bull run.</p>
<p>Congress is already working on a unified crypto regulatory framework and assigning crypto-specific roles to SEC and CFTC, meaning the next Bitcoin bull run couldn&rsquo;t be far away. If Saylor&rsquo;s prediction holds true, we would witness Bitcoin set a new all-time high at $250,000, beating its previous ATH at $68,789.</p>
<p></p>
Binance Has a New Challenger, And the Hybrid Exchange Could Overtake It
<p>On the journey to regulatory clarity for the cryptocurrency industry, the leading crypto exchange, Binance, has been caught in the web of the SEC. The crackdown on centralized exchanges has opened a window for the newer hybrid exchanges, which many crypto experts have called the future of crypto trading because they combine the best features of centralized and decentralized exchanges.</p>
<p>One hybrid exchange, Tradecurve, has set out to challenge the dominance of Binance by incorporating into its platform trading features that Binance lack, including more trading options (forex and derivatives), negative balance protection, self-management of private keys, low latency ultra-fast order execution, and algorithmic trading.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By looking to offer wider assets for trading and features that will make for a seamless trading experience, Tradecurve plans to topple Binance as the number one crypto trading platform. With the current regulatory crackdown on Binance, many crypto analysts believe Tradecurve has a chance to steal market share from Binance to reduce its dominance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tradecurve is on track to enact its plan, currently in the fourth presale phase expecting to raise $20 million to launch its platform. The project has enjoyed massive support from investors currently buying its native token, TCRV, at $0.018 per token.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Frax Finance, creators of one of the most innovative decentralized stablecoins and DeFi-focused stablecoin infrastructure, has unveiled its plans to roll out an Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain, aptly named Fraxchain. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The objective is simple but ambitious: to cultivate a smart contract platform with an unwavering focus on decentralized finance.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Frax Protocol: A Trio of Stablecoins and Integrated Subprotocols</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Frax Protocol represents a pioneering development in the crypto world. At its core, it issues three distinct decentralized stablecoins: FRAX, a USD pegged asset; the Frax Price Index (FPI) stablecoin, which uniquely ties its value to a basket of consumer goods, creating a new unit of account independent of national currencies; and FraxEther (frxETH), a stablecoin pegged to ETH, designed to replace WETH in smart contracts. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Complementing these stablecoins, the protocol also houses three subprotocols: Fraxlend, Fraxswap, and Fraxferry. Fraxswap, the first Automated Market Maker (AMM) using time-weighted average market maker orders, helps in rebalancing collateral, minting/redemptions, adjusting stablecoin supply, and deploying protocol-owned liquidity on-chain. Fraxlend creates a lending market for Frax-based stablecoins, allowing the origination of debt, bespoke non-custodial loans, and the incorporation of collateral assets into the Frax Finance economy. Lastly, Fraxferry enables the transfer of Frax Protocol tokens across multiple blockchains. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Frax Share (FXS) serves as the primary governance token across the Frax ecosystem, accruing fees, revenue, and excess collateral value. An additional governance token, FPIS, is specific to the FPI and shares its value capture with FXS holders. A Gauge Rewards System allows the community to propose rewards for strategies that integrate Frax-based stablecoins. The fixed, halving annual FXS emissions flow to different gauges based on veFXS staker votes.</p>
Frax Finance Sets Sights on Layer 2 with Fraxchain
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Fraxchain, a project by the makers of the Frax stablecoin, is set to strengthen the hold of decentralized finance in the blockchain landscape. &ldquo;Fraxchain marks the zenith of the entire Frax ecosystem and mirrors the traction and usage we&rsquo;ve attained,&rdquo; Frax founder Sam Kazemian explains.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">A Glimpse into the Fraxchain Framework</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The slated release date for this network is by the end of this calendar year. The network's governance will hinge on the holders of Frax Shares (FXS) tokens. The modus operandi of the network includes leveraging the Frax stablecoin and Frax Ether, the project's liquid staking derivative, for transaction fees. What's more, the fees garnered by the roll-up network could partially be burned or funneled back to the Ethereum mainnet, to be dispersed among stakers of the FXS governance token, Kazemian outlined. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Fraxchain hinges on a Layer 2 rollup model. In this arrangement, it will publish state roots to the Ethereum mainnet for securing the network. The rollup network will also incorporate decentralized sequencers&mdash;these nodes order transactions into batches in a rollup network. Any entity can operate them, as long as they secure the nod via a governance vote. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Kazemian further elaborated on this feature:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">&ldquo;Fraxchain proposes a solution where sequencer roles can be auctioned off and rotated, creating a decentralized sequencer base. If a sequencer is forced to shut down, Fraxchain would allow the next elected sequencer to pick up from where the previous one left off,&rdquo; he explained. </p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Fraxchain: By the Numbers</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">As per the numbers, Frax's ecosystem has made a significant mark on the world of crypto. As of this writing, the total supply of Frax stands at over $1.23 billion, while Frax Shares (FXS) have a market cap exceeding $371 million. The Frax stablecoin is listed on major exchanges and is integrated into numerous DeFi platforms, while FXS token is used for governance decisions, further cementing its position in the decentralized finance space.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The launch of Fraxchain encapsulates the pivotal move of Frax Finance to fortify its position in the DeFi world. It will be interesting to monitor the progress of this Layer 2 solution, with an eye on the continued growth and traction of the Frax ecosystem.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) joins the list of several other tokens caught up in the price drops due to the recent US Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s (SEC) lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crypto analysts study the charts to see what this means for the meme coin while also discovering a new token, rising against all odds&mdash;Uwerx.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This article explores what the SEC lawsuit could mean for Dogecoin (DOGE) while exploring the unique benefits Uwerx has to offer its users.&nbsp;</p>
Dogecoin (DOGE): The Fate of the Meme Coin
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE), like several other tokens, has been caught in the SEC lawsuit against Binance and Coinbase. While several media platforms spread uncertainty and fear regarding Dogecoin (DOGE), crypto analysts take a different approach to the token&rsquo;s price predictions.</p>
<p>Most media outlets have communicated that the recent sell-offs and price drops in Dogecoin (DOGE) forewarn investors of an even bleaker future. But crypto analysts have stated that the sell-offs and price drops were not driven by long-term traders but by short-term investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to industry experts, the fate of Dogecoin (DOGE) in the crypto market is less bleak than media outlets will lead most to believe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, Dogecoin (DOGE) sells at $0.061421, with a live market cap of $8,554,931,776. Dogecoin&rsquo;s (DOGE) market supply is presently at 139,736,336,384 DOGE. Due to market sentiments, Dogecoin (DOGE) is predicted to reach $0.092 by 2024.</p>
Uwerx (WERX): A Brighter Future
<p>Uwerx is positioned to be the leading freelance platform globally. Uwerx is set to be different and preferable compared to other freelancing platforms. Considering Uwerx&rsquo;s increasing numbers, one might state that Uwerx is already meeting its goals.</p>
<p>With over 6,200 sign-ups on the Uwerx platform, over 1,600 followers on Twitter, and over 1,600 subscribers to the Telegram community, the Uwerx platform is growing beyond all expectations. While other platforms might take this as a sign to work less hard, the Uwerx team remains unrelenting. With the current listing on CoinSniper and the scheduled Uwerx listing on Uniswap by the 1st of August, the Uwerx Team is doing all it can to ensure that Uwerx reaches its target audience.</p>
<p>The confidence of the Uwerx team in expanding its reach can be traced to several factors. Firstly, Uwerx has successfully passed its audit approval by InterFi Network and SolidProof. This implies that the platform is excellent by all standards in the industry. In addition, Uwerx is set to only offer a 1% transaction fee, a very affordable fee compared to Upwork and Fiverr&rsquo;s 10 and 20%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uwerx will also be offering its users incentivization and gamification features to serve as more motivation for their work. Uwerx will also put a 25-year liquidity lock in place for its tokens. Uwerx team tokens are included in the mix as team tokens have already been locked for nine months, further assuring Uwerx users of the security and stability of their tokens. Once Uwerx is unveiled on the 4th of August, 2023, contract ownerships will be renounced, thus eliminating the likelihood of scams and fraud.</p>
<p>The Uwerx Vault has now been unveiled, allowing Uwerx users to store their tokens securely, just like staking, as they get rewarded dependent on the variables existing within the platform. The&nbsp; Alpha platform has also been unveiled, and Uwerx will soon be transitioning from the Alpha Platform to the Beta platform, allowing Uwerx users to test the platform for themselves. The Uwerx team encourages users to send their feedback via email to the Uwerx team at feedback@uwerx.network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the 31st of July, 2023, when Uwerx&rsquo;s presale ends, WERX token holders will receive their tokens in a 6-week vesting period. Uwerx will also carry out a Test Airdrop when the Uwerx presale ends.&nbsp;</p>
Uwerx (WERX) Presale: Beyond the Stars
<p>The Uwerx team has been in awe of Uwerx&rsquo;s incredible growth and sell-out of its presale. The first four stages of Uwerx&rsquo;s presale were all sold out in a very short time. The Uwerx team has also had to modify the critical token allocations due to the high demands for Uwerx.</p>
<p>WERX tokens sell at $0.041 per token with a 15% bonus on all purchases. Considering that Uwerx will be launched officially on the 4th of August, this price is bound to increase soon.&nbsp;</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) joins the list of several other tokens caught up in the price drops due to the recent US Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s (SEC) lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crypto analysts study the charts to see what this means for the meme coin while also discovering a new token, rising against all odds&mdash;Uwerx.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This article explores what the SEC lawsuit could mean for Dogecoin (DOGE) while exploring the unique benefits Uwerx has to offer its users.&nbsp;</p>
Dogecoin (DOGE): The Fate of the Meme Coin
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE), like several other tokens, has been caught in the SEC lawsuit against Binance and Coinbase. While several media platforms spread uncertainty and fear regarding Dogecoin (DOGE), crypto analysts take a different approach to the token&rsquo;s price predictions.</p>
<p>Most media outlets have communicated that the recent sell-offs and price drops in Dogecoin (DOGE) forewarn investors of an even bleaker future. But crypto analysts have stated that the sell-offs and price drops were not driven by long-term traders but by short-term investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to industry experts, the fate of Dogecoin (DOGE) in the crypto market is less bleak than media outlets will lead most to believe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, Dogecoin (DOGE) sells at $0.061421, with a live market cap of $8,554,931,776. Dogecoin&rsquo;s (DOGE) market supply is presently at 139,736,336,384 DOGE. Due to market sentiments, Dogecoin (DOGE) is predicted to reach $0.092 by 2024.</p>
Uwerx (WERX): A Brighter Future
<p>Uwerx is positioned to be the leading freelance platform globally. Uwerx is set to be different and preferable compared to other freelancing platforms. Considering Uwerx&rsquo;s increasing numbers, one might state that Uwerx is already meeting its goals.</p>
<p>With over 6,200 sign-ups on the Uwerx platform, over 1,600 followers on Twitter, and over 1,600 subscribers to the Telegram community, the Uwerx platform is growing beyond all expectations. While other platforms might take this as a sign to work less hard, the Uwerx team remains unrelenting. With the current listing on CoinSniper and the scheduled Uwerx listing on Uniswap by the 1st of August, the Uwerx Team is doing all it can to ensure that Uwerx reaches its target audience.</p>
<p>The confidence of the Uwerx team in expanding its reach can be traced to several factors. Firstly, Uwerx has successfully passed its audit approval by InterFi Network and SolidProof. This implies that the platform is excellent by all standards in the industry. In addition, Uwerx is set to only offer a 1% transaction fee, a very affordable fee compared to Upwork and Fiverr&rsquo;s 10 and 20%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uwerx will also be offering its users incentivization and gamification features to serve as more motivation for their work. Uwerx will also put a 25-year liquidity lock in place for its tokens. Uwerx team tokens are included in the mix as team tokens have already been locked for nine months, further assuring Uwerx users of the security and stability of their tokens. Once Uwerx is unveiled on the 4th of August, 2023, contract ownerships will be renounced, thus eliminating the likelihood of scams and fraud.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange with roughly 62 million users, is reportedly under scrutiny from French financial regulatory authorities.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">According to a breaking report from Le Monde, investigations into the exchange's activities were to have been underway since at least the early quarter of 2022.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The inquest, led by the judicial investigation service of finance and under the specialized interregional jurisdiction of Paris, has brought into question the exchange's adherence to legal norms.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Reportedly, the focus of the probe revolves around "acts of illegal exercise of the function of service provider on digital assets (PSAN), and acts of aggravated money laundering." Particularly, the exchange is being examined for its participation in investment operations, concealment, and conversion - all purportedly carried out by offenders that generated profits.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Offhand, however, these allegations appear to be more a matter of misinterpretation and miscommunication withe the regulatory body than a wilful abandonment of due diligence from the side of Binance.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Binance Commits To KYC Procedures</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Simultaneously, questions have been raised about Binance's commitment to 'Know Your Customer' (KYC) procedures, a regulatory framework meant to curb money laundering activities. Reports suggest that Binance may not have been fully compliant with these protocols, leading to further speculation about the exchange's operations.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">To further complicate matters, it's alleged that Binance had been offering services to French customers without obtaining an appropriate operating license. Regulations enacted in 2019 require crypto exchanges to gain the approval of the Financial Markets Authority (AMF) to legally operate in France. Binance commenced operations in France in 2020 but purportedly only secured AMF approval in May 2022, fueling further controversy.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In response to the claims, a Binance spokesperson maintained that the company cooperates with global law enforcement and abides by all local laws. However, they refrained from commenting on specifics about the investigation.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"Binance invests considerable time and resources into cooperating with law enforcement globally. We abide by all laws in France, just as we do in every other market we operate," the exchange said in a tweet thread responding to reportage on the matter.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">To clarify:In France, on-site visits by regulators and inspectors, are part of regulatory obligations to which all financial institutions must adhere. We had an on-site visit last week by the relevant authorities. Binance, as always, was fully collaborative and we met our&hellip;</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Binance: Between Compliance and Current Charges</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This French investigation comes amidst Binance facing litigation in the United States. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has brought forward 13 charges against the crypto exchange's U.S. subsidiary and CEO Changpeng Zhao. Recent reportage also indicate that Binance.US has also cut off staff amid the ongoing legal troubles.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">These revelations underscore the challenging terrain for Binance, as well as for similar platforms such as Coinbase. As of mid-2022, the SEC stated that out of the 62 million users on Binance globally, only 25 million had filled in KYC documents. This implies a substantial proportion of users on the platform are operating without the requisite KYC documentation.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Binance&rsquo;s US affiliate conducted a round of layoffs after the SEC charged the exchange with securities violations last week. </p>
<p>Crypto giant Binance&rsquo;s US affiliate, Binance.US, has reportedly laid off some of its staff after the Securities and Exchange Commission sued the exchange with securities violations and sought a temporary restraining order to freeze the exchange&rsquo;s assets.</p>
<p>Reuters reports that around 50 people, or 10%, have been laid off. Sources say employees in the exchange&rsquo;s legal, compliance, and risk departments have been dismissed.</p>
<p>Media outlet CoinDesk cites documents in which Binance.US management described the SEC as a &ldquo;politically motivated regulator&rdquo; that forced the company to become a &ldquo;crypto-only exchange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The documents read:</p>

<p>As part of this transition, and because of our preparation for a multi-year and very costly litigation process, the Board has asked Management to shrink the size of our teams across the company and reduce our burn rate.</p>

<p>Adding:</p>

<p>Unlike every other US crypto company, we have been working to avoid this scenario, but circumstances have now shifted. This was a very hard decision &ndash; one that we didn&rsquo;t take lightly. We are sad to see our colleagues depart, but we wish them the best and will do what we can to assist them in this transition.</p>

Binance.US Suspends USD Deposits and Withdrawals
<p>Last week, the SEC sued Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao, accusing the exchange of allegedly mishandling customer funds and lying to investors and regulators about its operations.</p>
<p>The next day, the agency filed a motion for a temporary restraining order to freeze the assets of two of Binance&rsquo;s US units.</p>
<p>Days after the SEC filed suit against Binance and requested to freeze Binance.US&rsquo;s assets, the exchange announced that it was suspending US dollar deposits, and its banking partners were preparing to halt fiat withdrawals from June 13.</p>
