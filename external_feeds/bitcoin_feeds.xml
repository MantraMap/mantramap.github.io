According to Sam Altman, co-founder of the project, one person is currently verified by the iris scanning devices — the &#8220;Orb&#8221; — every 8 seconds. However, some data could call these claims into question. </strong></p>
<h2>Worldcoin Operations Allegedly Ramping Up, One Person Getting Verified Every 8 Seconds</h2>
<p>Worldcoin, a project that aims to become a digital decentralized ID that will serve to deploy a Universal Basic Income (UBI) system with Sybil protections, is seeing more interest from potential users, according to statements from its team.</p>
<p>The project launched officially on July 24 after more than three years of development, and it is currently ramping up its presence in different parts of the world. Photos of the iris scanning devices, called &#8220;Orbs,&#8221; have been shown on Worldcoin&#8217;s social media accounts, confirming their presence in cities like <a href="https://twitter.com/worldcoin/status/1683847162357252098?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lisbon</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/worldcoin/status/1683570443209392130?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miami</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/worldcoin/status/1684258452691128321?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Los Angeles</a>, even as the World App is not available in the U.S. due to lack of regulatory clarity.</p>
<p>Sam Altman, CEO of Openai and co-founder of Worldcoin, <a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1684297687708098565?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> a video on social media showing users waiting in line to be signed up using an Orb to verify their identities. Altman stated there were &#8220;crazy lines around the world,&#8221; declaring that one person was getting verified every 8 seconds.</p>

<h2>Altman&#8217;s Objectives</h2>
<p>Due to the supposed high level of demand, Worldcoin is now allowing users to reserve their genesis airdrop of 25 WLD, the native token of the protocol, and be verified later to obtain it. However, reports indicate this demand might not be as high as Altman states. For example, a recent article <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3228973/chatgpt-creators-iris-scanning-crypto-project-signs-hundreds-users-hong-kong-amid-controversy?module=live&amp;pgtype=homepage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> on SCMP declares only a few hundred participants registered in Hong Kong on Monday and Tuesday.</p>
<p>While Worldcoin <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sam-altman-backed-worldcoin-reaches-2-million-signups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> it had reached 2 million signups on July 13, the data shows that only about 13% of these users have possession of the WLD tokens on the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/worldcoin-migrates-to-optimism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Optimism</a> network. According to <a href="https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0xdc6ff44d5d932cbd77b52e5612ba0529dc6226f1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Etherscan</a>, less than 270,000 participants are holding WLD, the protocol&#8217;s token. This is still far from the 2 billion people Altman <a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1683380244013809664?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> recently on social media as his final goal.</p>
<p>According to blockchain research company <a href="https://marketing.kaiko.com/worldcoins-lauch?ecid=AOKeC1Y5KnhB5RM1MYegOhVgYjtelmT_izmJgn0TFogNFfcRyM7sdeii0mzn2WvovyYsADntciY1&amp;utm_campaign=Research%20newsletter&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=74402224&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_AXH6O2CNLn94ufnjXnuWEPciBhkoT889_mepj7-2U-4aoFaS8Fiz8bbiCXR1QOBtoxht8nHlEwmbTnTGYEWIxYPj6tQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kaiko</a>, due to the distribution of liquidity among market makers, the first weeks might be crucial for the project, given that the value of the airdrop is close to $50 is &#8220;and will likely stay in that range for the next three months.&#8221;</p>

Putin stated that this weaponization and the recent developments in global finance complicated the institution&#8217;s growth to help third-world countries facing difficult conditions.</strong></p>
<h2>Russian President Vladimir Putin Talks Dollar Weaponization in Recent Meeting</h2>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin referred to the weaponization of the dollar and its effects on the global economy in a recent meeting with Dilma Rousseff, president of the New Development Bank (NDB) — also known as the BRICS bank — during the second Russia-Africa Summit held in Saint Petersburg. Putin explained this weaponization complicated Rousseff&#8217;s task of growing and developing the NDB&#8217;s role in the current international arena.</p>
<p>Talking to Rousseff, Putin <a href="http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/71809" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am confident that &#8230; you will make every effort to develop this institution. In the current conditions, it is not easy to do so, given the developments in global finance and the use of the dollar as a political weapon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, Putin declared that the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) were &#8220;increasing the use of national currencies in their mutual settlements,&#8221; mentioning that the NDB might have a role to play in boosting these joint activities.</p>

<h2>Rousseff&#8217;s Statements</h2>
<p>Rousseff stated that even as the bank faces liquidity problems, the institution is called to develop a more significant role in the emerging multipolar world order. She explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The bank should play a major role in the development of a multipolar, polycentric world. We must work to attract investment in the markets of our partners.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Putin had <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russian-president-vladimir-putin-states-emergent-multipolar-world-order-will-be-more-just/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declared</a> previously that this new multipolar world already being shaped will be &#8220;more just and democratic.&#8221; Rousseff also talked in favor of using national currencies for international trade, stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I also believe that the countries of the developing world can freely make their foreign trade transactions between themselves in their national currencies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Roscongress Foundation, a Russian think tank that sponsors the Russia-Africa Summit, had <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russian-think-tank-profiles-brics-bank-as-imf-counterpart-to-de-dollarize-credit-markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">profiled</a> the role of the NDB as a counterpart to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in a report published in May. In Roscongress&#8217; vision, the bank could issue &#8220;energy loans&#8221; based on the energy exporting capabilities of each member.</p>
<p>These energy loans would be secured through the NDB, being liquid due to its multi-currency nature, similar to the IMF&#8217;s Special Drawing Rights (SDR).</p>

However, according to the state&#8217;s new rules, crypto donations must be converted to U.S. dollars within five days. In the event of price changes within the five-day grace period, these must be shown separately in campaign finance reports.</strong></p>
<h2>Converting Crypto Donations to Dollars</h2>
<p>The U.S. state of Minnesota has become one of the first states in the country to okay crypto donations to political campaign committees. Under the state&#8217;s new rules, which took effect in July 2023, recipients of crypto donations are nevertheless required to convert these to U.S. dollars within five days.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/twin-cities/2023/07/27/crypto-campaign-donations-minnesota-legal-elections">report</a> by Axios, the crypto contributions must be valued at the digital assets&#8217; respective prices when the donations were made. In the event of the prices changing within the five-day grace period, such changes must be shown separately in campaign finance reports.</p>
<p>Minnesota&#8217;s decision to allow crypto contributions was made after the state’s Campaign Finance &amp; Public Disclosure Board received inquiries from campaign teams which wanted to know the procedures for accepting crypto donations. According to Jeff Sigurdson, the CEO of the state’s political finance and disclosure body, these inquiries in turn prompted it to ask legislators to look into this.</p>
<p>Although the state has okayed crypto contributions, prospective recipients of such donations are still wary of digital assets’ volatility. The identity of crypto donors is also another key concern for the campaign committees.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<h2>Politicians Not in a Hurry to Receive Crypto Donations</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, U.S. congressman Ken Martin is quoted in the report stating that he is not seeking to actively raise crypto donations.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s so much that you have to do to verify cryptocurrency and &#8230; accept it that it&#8217;s somewhat of an administrative nightmare,&#8221; Martin said.</p>
<p>Minnesota Republican David Han claimed that politicians from the state will accept any &#8220;lawful contribution to help our cause.&#8221; He however claimed that politicians in the state are currently not focused much on raising funds via crypto donations.</p>
<p>As per the report, the new rules are expected to give the green light for collecting political donations via Venmo and other mobile payment apps.</p>

<h2>FIT for the 21st Century Act Advances</h2>
<p>U.S. lawmakers have advanced the Financial Innovation and Technology (FIT) for the 21st Century Act (<a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/BA/BA00/20230726/116291/BILLS-118HR4763ih.pdf">H.R. 4763</a>). On Wednesday, the House Financial Services Committee passed the bill, followed by the House Committee on Agriculture approving it on Thursday. The FIT for the 21st Century Act establishes a digital asset framework to provide regulatory certainty to the crypto market.</p>
<p>Reps. French Hill (R-AR), chairman of the Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Inclusion; Glenn &#8220;GT&#8221; Thompson (R-PA), chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture; and Dusty Johnson (R-SD), chairman of the Subcommittee on Commodity Markets, Digital Assets, and Rural Development introduced the bill on July 20. Its co-sponsors include Reps. Tom Emmer (R-MN) and Warren Davidson (R-OH).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-600087 aligncenter" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/dusty-johnson-tweet.jpg" alt="" width="915" height="344" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/dusty-johnson-tweet-300x113.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/dusty-johnson-tweet-768x289.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/dusty-johnson-tweet.jpg 915w" sizes="(max-width: 915px) 100vw, 915px" /></p>
<p>Rep. Johnson explained: “The digital asset space is muddled with regulatory uncertainty, lack of authority, and a lacking framework for core operating principles.” He elaborated:</p>
<blockquote><p>The crypto industry wants clarity and our collaborative bill gives both the CFTC and SEC a seat at the table. Our bill establishes clear principles to ensure financial security and certainty as digital asset developers continue to innovate.</p></blockquote>
<p>The FIT for the 21st Century Act also contains a provision that provides for joint rulemakings between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).</p>
<p>Congressman Hill commented on Wednesday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Congress has heeded the call for strong consumer protections and a functional regulatory framework, which is why I introduced my bill after working closely with key stakeholders, the Biden administration, and members from both sides of the aisle.</p></blockquote>
<p>“The status quo is not solving problems, it’s not serving people, and it’s leaving America weaker by the day for failing to provide clarity in the digital assets market. We now have the opportunity to harness and embrace this next generation of technology in the United States,” said Congressman Davidson.</p>

The two parties have reached an initial agreement, in principle, following bankruptcy protection disputes that have made industry headlines. An official letter to the bankruptcy judge representing their cases has affirmed the intent of the firms to put their settlement into motion.</strong></p>
<h2>FTX, Genesis Engage in Crypto Bankruptcy Settlement</h2>
<p>The saga, rooted in the insolvency of FTX Trading, began when the company claimed that Genesis, a crypto lending platform, owed them a sum of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-06/genesis-s-2-billion-spat-with-ftx-may-delay-creditor-payouts?in_source=embedded-checkout-banner#xj4y7vzkg">nearly $2 billion</a>. This claim could have considerably slowed down Genesis&#8217; court procedures. Now, with the letter to the presiding judge dated July 27, 2023, the path to settlement seems more tangible, promising to bring an end to the bankruptcy bickering.</p>
<p>The missive to the court represents a significant step in resolving the issue between the disputing parties. FTX Trading Ltd., and its associated debtors, along with the debtors in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy case, have confirmed that they&#8217;ve reached a preliminary agreement. The court filing states:</p>
<blockquote><p>The parties have reached an agreement in principle, subject to documentation, regarding a settlement that would resolve, among other things, the claims asserted by the FTX debtors against the debtors in these Chapter 11 Cases and the claims asserted by the Genesis debtors against the FTX debtors in the FTX Chapter 11 cases.</p></blockquote>
<p>Moreover, the settlement plans to dismiss FTX&#8217;s motion to modify the automatic stay and the motion to establish procedures for estimating the number of FTX debtors&#8217; claims against the debtors.</p>
<p>In essence, the settlement&#8217;s approval would mean the withdrawal of these motions, simplifying the otherwise complex legal proceedings. The settlement&#8217;s details are yet to be disclosed. However, the involved parties detailed they are set to act swiftly to formalize their agreement and seek approval from the court.</p>
<p>Genesis continues to grapple with additional legal tussles, including a freshly lodged <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/gemini-files-lawsuit-against-digital-currency-group-and-barry-silbert-alleging-fraud-and-deception/">lawsuit</a> aimed at its parent entity, Digital Currency Group (DCG), as well as its CEO and progenitor, Barry Silbert.</p>

The online survey of 1,503 participants aimed to gauge meme coins&#8217; potential in the cryptocurrency market. It revealed several findings about investor sentiments, behaviors, and perceptions surrounding these unique digital assets.</strong></p>
<h2>Meme Coins: Gamble or Investment?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://chainplay.gg/blog/state-of-memecoin-2023/">study</a> by chainplay.gg titled &#8220;State of Meme Coin&#8221; revealed a divide between investors who have purchased meme coins (63.9%) and those avoiding them (36.1%). Of the investors purchasing meme coins, a majority (69%) do it for fun. Yet, 79% still perceive them as long-term investments with the potential for profit, even though 70% suspect most meme coins are fraudulent. Additionally, 73% equate investing in meme coins to mere gambling.</p>
<p>The primary concerns about meme coins, according to nearly 64% of the study&#8217;s respondents, are scams and rug pulls. Over half (55.13%) also expressed skepticism about the future of these assets. The study found that 92% dedicate less than 25% of their cryptocurrency portfolio to meme coins. Moreover, 51% spend less than an hour researching before investing, primarily focusing on meme popularity, social media activity and community engagement.</p>
<p>At present, the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/meme-coin-economy-grows-by-759m-in-30-days-doge-and-shib-still-dominate-the-market/">leading meme coins</a>, gauged by market capitalization, command a combined net value exceeding $17 billion. Taking the lead this week among the quintet of top meme coin assets is <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/DOGE/">dogecoin (DOGE)</a>, posting a gain of 9.9% against the U.S. dollar. <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/SHIB/">Shiba inu (SHIB)</a> has also seen growth, albeit at a lesser rate of 1.6%. Meanwhile, the third most prominent meme coin, pepe (PEPE), has experienced a downturn, losing 10.9% over the past week. As of July 27, 2023, the meme coin market reported $904.36 million in 24-hour worldwide trading volume.</p>
<p>In the study, one in five cryptocurrency investors surveyed globally said they were introduced to digital currencies because of meme coins. Of those purchasing them, 32% have less than a year of experience in the market. This suggests that the hype around meme coins is drawing some newcomers, though it&#8217;s not the predominant entry point.</p>
<p>When asked about potential growth drivers if meme coins prosper, the top responses were celebrity endorsements, partnerships with major brands, and integrated utility. However, over half of the respondents were skeptical or indifferent about artificial intelligence (AI)-generated meme coins. The study says that if the meme coin economy “thrives” going forward, investors suggest it will be attributed to four factors.</p>
<p>About 12% of respondents suggest that AI-related adoption and application could be a factor, while 22% believe it will be due to more practical use cases or real-world applications. Meanwhile, 23% attribute it to popularity among younger generations, and 26% stated they expect growth from the overall explosive growth of cryptocurrency.</p>

Data reveals that 944,000 Optimism transactions were processed on Thursday, with WLD transfers closing in on 1 million.</strong></p>
<h2>WLD Token Arrival Spurs Transaction Surge on Optimism: New Milestone Reached</h2>
<p>The Ethereum layer two (L2) network, Optimism, is reaping the benefits from Worldcoin&#8217;s (WLD) debut as the token integrated with the L2 blockchain before its introduction. As of 11:03 a.m. Eastern Time on Friday, <a href="https://archive.ph/dEWom#selection-833.0-833.7">archived records</a> show that 285,527 distinct addresses possess WLD, and thus far, WLD has recorded 887,482 transactions. As a result, Optimism&#8217;s daily transfers have soared to new levels.</p>
<p>For example, according to Dune Analytics <a href="https://dune.com/blockworks_research/l2-comparison-dashboard">data</a>, Optimism&#8217;s daily transactions reached 808,942 transfers on July 26, 2023. Taken together, the L2 networks Optimism and Arbitrum surpassed the number of Ethereum transactions; however, Ethereum processed more than a million and outperformed them individually. <a href="https://archive.ph/z8wix#selection-609.0-609.7">Archived statistics</a> for July 27, 2023, demonstrate that 944,668 transfers were completed on Optimism, setting a new all-time daily record for the chain.</p>
<p>Transacting on Optimism is significantly more cost-effective compared to Ethereum. Currently, the average transfer fee on Optimism stands at $0.334 per transaction. Meanwhile, Ethereum&#8217;s average cost exceeds <a href="https://etherscan.io/gastracker">$2 per transfer</a>. Initially, WLD was slated to be hosted on Ethereum; however, the Worldcoin team <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/worldcoin-migrates-to-optimism/">announced</a> Optimism integration shortly before the token&#8217;s launch.</p>
<p>Although Optimism has yet to surpass Ethereum&#8217;s daily transaction rate, its L2 counterpart Arbitrum <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/arbitrums-daily-transaction-count-surpasses-ethereum-for-the-first-time-ever/">did outpace Ethereum</a> last February. Arbitrum&#8217;s transaction growth was propelled by soaring Ethereum fees that month. Similar to how WLD tokens boosted Optimism transactions, Arbitrum&#8217;s native cryptocurrency launch also helped drive its daily transfers to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/arbitrum-registers-record-activity-over-the-last-2-weeks-as-transactions-per-day-count-surges/">record-breaking heights</a>.</p>

The report is based on predictions by a panel of 29 cryptocurrency and fintech experts who also expressed confidence about the long-term growth of the digital currency. Additionally, most panelists believe it&#x2019;s unlikely the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will classify <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> as a security.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Ethereum Price Predictions and Market Outlook</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Ethereum&#x2019;s price uptick can be attributed to bitcoin&#x2019;s recent surge, according to Omnia Markets founder and CEO, Mitesh Shah. He noted that as bitcoin&#x2019;s value increases due to factors like institutional adoption, ether&#x2019;s price is also expected to rise as investors look to diversify their portfolios. Shah gave an end-of-year prediction aligning with the panel average at $2,400, in Finder&#x2019;s latest <a href="https://www.finder.com/ethereum-price-prediction-2023">ETH price prediction report</a>.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-600088" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/predicts.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="500" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/predicts-300x117.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/predicts-1024x400.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/predicts-768x300.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/predicts.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px">&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Swyftx&#x2019;s head of product, Tommy Honan, is even more bullish, predicting ether to end the year at $2,500. He attributes his forecast to the successful upgrade to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. He thinks the upgrade has made Ethereum more efficient and deflationary and has boosted its appeal among both retail and institutional investors.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;Ethereum remains the standout second choice investment for both the retail and institutional investors alike. Following the successful upgrade to proof of stake, which has been akin to &#x2018;changing a jet plane engine, mid-flight,&#x2019; <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> has become more efficient and deflationary to mention a few,&#x201D; Honan remarked.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The panel&#x2019;s optimistic view extends beyond 2023. They predict that by the end of 2025, ethereum&#x2019;s price will reach $5,845 and rise further to $16,414 by the end of 2030. Futurist Joseph Raczynski is even more bullish, forecasting a price of $8,000 for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> by 2025, and nearly doubling to $15,000 by 2030.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Raczynski believes that a number of regulatory hurdles will be overcome this year for ethereum, which will contribute to its overall growth. He adds that despite short-term growth, ethereum&#x2019;s real price potential lies in the next 5-10 years.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>Regulatory Uncertainty</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
A significant part of the panel discussion revolved around the SEC&#x2019;s potential classification of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> as a security. The majority (67%) of Finder&#x2019;s panel do not believe that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> will be deemed a security. However, 11% believe it is likely, while the remaining 22% are uncertain.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Seasonal Tokens founder Ruadhan O is part of the majority who believe that it&#x2019;s unlikely <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> will be deemed a security. He expressed concern that such a ruling would limit the ability of U.S. residents to access smart contract technology.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;If ethereum is declared to be a security, then exchanges would not be able to offer it to U.S. residents without violating securities laws,&#x201D; the Seasonal Tokens executive said. &#x201C;This would make the US into the only country in the world where there is no easy access to smart contract technology.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Digital Capital Management Managing Director Ben Ritchie, who falls within the 22% uncertainty bracket, noted that Ethereum&#x2019;s decentralized nature could work in its favor. However, he expressed concerns about the increasing prominence of centralized staking solutions, which could pose a threat to the network&#x2019;s decentralization.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Concluding the report, the majority (56%) of Finder&#x2019;s panel believe now is the right time to buy <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>. About 41% advise holding onto the cryptocurrency, and a mere 4% suggest selling.

In the rapidly evolving crypto landscape, the LBank exchange platform is making waves. Their noteworthy achievement of being ranked among the top 5 global exchanges in CoinMarketCap&#8217;s (CMC) H1 report is reflective of their innovative strategies and an unyielding commitment to driving the industry forward.</p>
<p><strong>Strategizing Success with MEME Coins</strong></p>
<p>In the first half of the year, LBank, as per the CMC report, showcased an impressive performance with a market share of 4.6%, ranking 5th in spot trading volume. The catalyst for this growth was their strategic focus on MEME coins, an asset class often perceived as high risk due to its volatility. LBank&#8217;s effective MEME Listing strategy has played a crucial role in this achievement, aiding users in selecting quality MEME coins and creating a reputation for reliability.</p>
<p><strong>Risk and Profitability: A Balancing Act</strong></p>
<p>Profitability in the MEME coins market, given its inherently volatile nature, cannot be promised, a fact that LBank&#8217;s founder, Eric He, acknowledges upfront. However, he also stresses that LBank maintains a strong commitment to its users by implementing rigorous vetting and early listing of promising MEME coins.</p>
<p>This commitment is reflected in the platform&#8217;s robust selection process for listing new MEME coins. Each prospective coin undergoes a stringent review process where several factors, including contract quality, founder credibility, trading depth, and market popularity, are meticulously scrutinized. The aim is to ensure that only those assets meeting LBank&#8217;s high standards are listed, enhancing the likelihood of investors trading in quality assets.</p>
<p>But the commitment does not end with rigorous vetting; LBank further secures an advantage for its users by listing coins early. The platform ensures that promising coins are accessible to investors as soon as possible, potentially at lower price points. A testament to this approach was the listing of PEPE on April 18th, arguably the earliest among known centralized exchanges.</p>
<p>This proactive move by LBank provided a notable advantage to its users. After being listed on LBank, PEPE saw an impressive rise in value, with its maximum increase reaching a staggering 6387%. The case of PEPE thus underscores the potential benefits of LBank&#8217;s approach, which couples rigorous selection with early listing, enabling users to access promising MEME coins at potentially more favorable price points.</p>
<p><strong>Supporting the MEME Coin Sector Beyond Listing</strong></p>
<p>The support for MEME coins on LBank extends beyond simply listing. The platform demonstrates tangible commitment through several initiatives. The recently established $10 million MEME Fund by LBank Labs is designed to stimulate early-stage innovative MEME projects, nurture industry growth, and give back to the community. Furthermore, LBank has hosted the MEME Journey voting contest, sparking enthusiasm within the community. The first MemeKing voting event saw impressive participation, with QUACK securing victory with a staggering 500,000 votes, earning the coveted title of MemeKing. The second round saw similar enthusiasm, with 4CHAN triumphing with an impressive 150,000 votes. The event generated over 100 million impressions on Crypto Twitter, which further demonstrated the enthusiastic spirit of the global Memecoin community.</p>
<p><strong>Embracing Innovation Beyond High-Risk Assets</strong></p>
<p>When asked about LBank&#8217;s stance on supporting high-risk MEME coins, Eric He takes a broader view. He asserts that LBank&#8217;s commitment isn&#8217;t confined to MEME coins alone but extends to all innovative blockchain coins. In his view, the embrace of MEME coins represents the first step in LBank&#8217;s larger strategy to support innovation within the cryptocurrency landscape.</p>
<p>This commitment to supporting innovative coins positions LBank as a frontrunner in the market, ready to deepen its presence and partnership with innovative project teams in the industry.</p>
<p>He emphasizes that LBank will continue to be a pioneer in this market, working closely with innovative projects to continually cultivate and advance the market. This holistic approach highlights LBank&#8217;s commitment to driving innovation and growth in the broader blockchain and crypto industry, demonstrating its role as more than just an exchange platform.</p>
<p>As we look to the future, the latest CMC H1 report underscores LBank&#8217;s continued growth and commitment to top-tier Centralized Exchange (CEX) services. By prioritizing MEME coins, LBank has shown a willingness to embrace risk, supporting innovation and engaging their community in the ever-evolving crypto market. As the industry landscape continues to evolve, LBank stands ready to contribute to its growth and diversification.</p>
