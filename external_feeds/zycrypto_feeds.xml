<li>Russia terminates plans to launch a state-owned digital asset exchange with plans to back private investors.</li>



<li>According to authorities, the rules will be a model for the entire industry to facilitate cross-border payments amongst others.</li>



<li>Experts weigh in on the Kremlin’s stance on digital assets amid financial restrictions by the EU and other international organizations.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Russia has long been criticized for its mixed signals towards digital assets. However, this could change soon as the news of backing private exchanges marks a new dawn for the country’s relationship with cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>Russian lawmakers plan to cease the formation of government-owned cryptocurrency exchanges with talks of introducing a new regulation template for private firms. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/wublockchain/status/1663188043178844162?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">reports</a>, the country will move forward with a broad regulatory framework to be monitored by the Central Bank.</p>



<p>Anatoly Aksakov, the head of the lower House Committee on Financial Markets, stated that private firms would be encouraged to facilitate cross-border payments subject to certain restrictions that the government will impose.</p>



<p>“<em>Instead of creating one national crypto exchange, it is planned to establish rules for the establishment and operation of such infrastructures,” </em>he added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Throwing more light on the government’s position, Ivan Chebeskov, the Director of Financial Policy in the Ministry of Finance, stated that “<em>The Ministry did not support the establishment of one national crypto-exchange. The idea, instead, is to legally regulate the possibility of creating such sites by business.”</em></p>



<p>Industry experts have hailed the move describing it as a step in the right direction. Olieg Ogienko, the founder of BitRiver, said that the move will help cushion the risk of sanctions and cyber attacks on crypto infrastructure and eliminate monopolies. Similarly, GIS Mining boss Ivan Gostev added,</p>



<p>“<em>It would allow for more competitive and innovative companies to develop</em>.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-russia-s-move-to-digital-assets"><strong>Russia&#8217;s move to digital assets</strong></h2>



<p>Mixed signals have plagued Russia’s relationship with cryptocurrencies for years, beginning with the government’s desire for total fiscal control. Last year, the Bank of Russia announced plans for an outright ban of Bitcoin payments before the Ministry of Finance proposed a deal for crypto regulation.</p>



<p>Months later, President Vladimir Putin signed a law prohibiting digital asset payments citing risk and economic sabotage. Sanctions imposed on Russia due to the Ukraine invasion led to the country <a href="https://zycrypto.com/russia-turns-to-stablecoins-in-droves-as-sanctions-bite-even-harder/">exploring</a> stablecoins to bypass financial restrictions. </p>



<p>This new move will strengthen the country’s position as a virtual currency-friendly country. In 2020, Russia was ranked #2 in terms of digital asset adoption, with 12% of the country&#8217;s population owning crypto.</p>

<ul>
<li>Bitcoin Miladys rolls out a “bridge” that lets Ethereum NFT users migrate to the Bitcoin Network through Ordinals.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The process automatically destroys the original NFT on Ethereum when transferred, earning the tag “<em>a one-way trip”&nbsp;</em></li>



<li>The move puts BTC enthusiasts in a frenzy as they count on the benefits of having sought-after Ethereum NFTs on their network.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Six months after its launch and with over 10 million inscriptions, Ordinals is paving the way for top developers looking to integrate the Bitcoin (BTC) ecosystem with the cryptoverse.</p>



<p>The developers behind Bitcoin Miladys have announced the possibility of Ethereum non-fungible token (NFT) holders transferring their assets to the Bitcoin Network. Still, there is a little caveat, the Ethereum copy gets permanently destroyed.</p>



<p>The project was launched in partnership with Xverse Bitcoin Wallet, and Ordinals Market leverages a burn and mint process to move assets between both networks. The BRC- 721E token standard bridge, as it is fondly called, sends the Ethereum NFTs to a burn address, making it completely inaccessible to the holder after it is destroyed. The token is then re-created on Bitcoin through Ordinals. </p>



<p>Several cross-chain bridges act as escrow platforms that hold user tokens even after minting secondary tokens on another network. If the user wants to reclaim the primary asset in the future, the secondary asset is burned.</p>



<p>Although more beneficial to users, this escrow process is not compatible with the BRC-721E process as it is only a one-way trip. This process can lead to issues for NFT holders, including loss of assets if not implemented properly. A similar issue occurred earlier this year when a Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) holder burned his NFT on Ethereum and tried to mint it on Bitcoin. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-community-laud-btc-ordinals-development"><strong>Community laud BTC Ordinals&#8217; development</strong></h2>



<p>Earlier this year, there were endless debates on the utilities of Ordinals to the Bitcoin Network. While many saw it as an opportunity to bolster an upward momentum, others felt the network should be left as it was without “<em>worthless tokens.”</em></p>



<p>Recent events may have proved doubters wrong as users now BTC Ordinals have <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ordinals-attract-ethereum-devs-to-bitcoin-as-projects-mass-adoption-skyrockets/">ignited</a> forces even outside the network to create tools for its expansion. The BRC-721E projects can swing millions into the Bitcoin ecosystem and place it in direct competition with Ethereum and Solana.</p>



<p>The project which enables immutable and verified Ethereum NFTs to Bitcoin has been described as “<em>the turning point.” </em>The project works with all Ethereum NFTs and is not limited to Miladys, according to the Ordinal Market page.</p>

<ul>
<li>Apple will kick off its metaverse push with a mixed-reality headset. </li>



<li>The technology giant is developing RealityOs software to complement its high-end hardware in creating the perfect metaverse solution.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Meta is on its way to roll out a cheaper headset with more compatibility (Quest 3), setting the stage for a big tech rivalry. </li>
</ul>



<p>The battle for the ideal metaverse platform enters top gear, with Meta and Apple leading the quest to create the perfect augmented reality experience despite a few roadblocks.</p>



<p>According to a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-29/when-is-wwdc-2023-when-will-apple-announce-mixed-reality-headset-june-5">report</a>, Apple will launch its first virtual reality headset on June 5 at the company’s WWDC conference. The much-anticipated headset is termed a mixed reality headset because it offers both argument reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) functionalities, although AR-specific hardware will be released subsequently.</p>



<p>Apple began planning its foray into the metaverse in 2015 and is currently on track to release multiple gaming experiences for its users. Based on its previous trademark filings, the high-end headset is reportedly called the Reality Pro or Reality One. </p>



<p>The Apple headset is expected to have two Micro OLED screens with a detailed 8K resolution which internal cameras will boost. Apple plans to erase criticisms heaped on Metaverse platforms for spending billions of dollars while delivering poor quality graphics and overall user experience.</p>



<p>The team also deployed the popular M2 processor from the company’s MacBook, including sensors that can recreate and detect user leg movements, a feature its rival Meta is yet to get a hang on. Furthermore, retina scanners will be incorporated for extra biometric security during logins and will be used for payments.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meta-vs-apple-battle-for-the-metaverse"><strong>Meta vs Apple: Battle for the metaverse</strong></h2>



<p>Meta has more metaverse buzz around it, with its founder Mark Zuckerberg backing the creation despite losses encountered so far. Apple’s Tim Cook is very bullish on Augmented Reality, stressing the use cases it can bring to the real world.</p>



<p>“<em>I think AR is a profound technology that will affect everything. Imagine suddenly being able to teach with AR and demonstrate things that way. Or medically, and so on. Like I said, we are going to look back and think about how we once lived without AR,” </em>he stated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Analyzing the business model of both companies, one can predict that Meta will offer more interoperability than Apple because of the former’s “wall garden” approach to products. Zuckerberg has also <a href="https://zycrypto.com/mark-zuckerberg-reiterates-metas-plan-for-an-open-interoperable-metaverse-heres-how/">noted</a> that an “<em>open and interoperable metaverse is better for everyone.”</em></p>



<p>Most observers expect Apple to beat Meta in terms of graphics and user interaction, a feature that Meta has struggled with in past releases. Meta has announced the launch of Quest 3, a cheaper headset many view as a direct response to Apple’s planned release.</p>

<p>The United States leading digital asset Coinbase has announced its plans to launch institutional Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) futures trading contracts on its derivatives exchange on June 5.</p>



<p>The product, which will <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbase-derivatives-exchange-will-launch-institutional-sized-bitcoin-and">launch</a> on the Commodity and  Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) regulated derivatives exchange, will be sized at 1BTC and 10 ETH to help investors manage exposures. In its release, the exchange noted that this service would help investors “<em>target attractive returns” </em>for lower fees.</p>



<p>Coinbase Bitcoin (BTI) and Coinbase Ethereum (ETI) futures contracts will both be available to investors through regulated futures commission merchants (FCMs) and other associated brokers. The exchange also announced additional incentive programs for institutions that participate in the contracts.</p>



<p>The future trading contracts were borne out of popular demand as a result of its past products. The exchange introduced nano Bitcoin (BT) and Ethereum (ET) contracts and recorded a massive spike in institutional demand for advanced derivatives products.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company reiterated its commitment to creating a secure and transparent trading system with the necessary tools to make participants successful.&nbsp;</p>



<p>”<em>Introducing institutional-sized contracts marks another milestone in our ongoing mission to provide accessible and cutting-edge financial instruments to market participants and underscores our dedication to solutions tailored to the needs of institutional clients,” </em>the statement reads.</p>



<p>On May 2, Coinbase announced its plans to open a derivatives exchange in Bermuda in its international expansion plan and will let users trade perpetual future contracts with 5X leverage. Per the announcement, all trades will be settled in USDC stablecoin as it seeks to balance and value for participants.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-coinbase-march-on-amid-regulatory-uncertainty">Coinbase march on amid regulatory uncertainty</h2>



<p>Coinbase has restated its commitment to comply with regulatory practices across jurisdictions as it continues its international expansion. The announcement of futures trading contracts comes with the exchange seeking regulatory clarity from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Commission in its reply to Coinbase&#8217;s writ of mandamus stated that the rulemaking process could stretch into many years but will continue to employ enforcement actions to bring clarity to the sector. The SEC also added that public statements do not constitute guidance or policy statements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While regulations in the United States remain unclear, Coinbase continues its global push as it seeks to fight for a higher market share with competitors.</p>

<p>The Russian bank Rosbank has become the first <a href="https://zycrypto.com/russian-banking-giant-sber-adds-ethereum-and-metamask-support/">biggest bank</a> in the country to launch cross-border cryptocurrency payments, with the help of an intermediary fintech to carry out the transactions.</p>



<p>According to Vedomosti, a representative of Rosbank it was stated that the bank is already conducting tests with corporate and private clients. The new solution allows the purchase of cryptocurrencies abroad using the funds of the importer, which are then transferred to the foreign provider.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rosbank-joins-forces-with-b-crypto-to-launch-new-services"><strong>Rosbank joins forces with B-crypto to launch new services</strong></h2>



<p>The Russian fintech company B-crypto is responsible for providing technical support for cryptocurrency transactions. Therefore, all Russian companies must go through a verification or KYC process that needs to be approved by both Rosbank and B-crypto in order to utilize the new cryptocurrency service.</p>



<p>Once the KYC verifications are approved, the importer and B-crypto sign a contract in which the client agrees to deposit fiat funds into an account at Rosbank to purchase cryptocurrencies. Subsequently, the bank transfers the money to B-crypto, which handles cryptocurrency purchases in friendly countries and transfers them to the foreign provider.</p>



<p>Alexei Voilukov, Vice President of the Russian Banks Association, affirmed that while Rosbank is the first major bank to offer this solution, larger banks still do not provide similar services &#8220;due to the lack of cryptocurrency liquidity&#8221; required to cater to their larger clients.</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s where smaller banks come in to meet the needs of retail customers.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Sanctioned countries embrace cryptocurrencies to evade sanctions</strong></h2>



<p>Eduard Davydov, Senior Partner at Emet Law Firm, stated that using cryptocurrencies in cross-border transfers may raise concerns regarding sanctions evasion, as many countries are taking measures to include cryptocurrency transactions in their sanction regimes.</p>



<p>In the long run, using cryptocurrencies for <a href="https://zycrypto.com/russia-to-legalize-crypto-for-cross-border-settlements/">cross-border payments</a> could lead to legal consequences for participating countries attempting to evade sanctions using cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, for a country under sanctions, legalities might not be their most pressing issue. Numerous such nations, including Cuba, Venezuela, Iran, Iraq, and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/russia-turns-to-stablecoins-in-droves-as-sanctions-bite-even-harder/">Russia</a>, find themselves denied the liberty to trade their primary commodities freely.</p>



<p>Currently, Russia is the most heavily sanctioned country in the world following the invasion of Ukraine, accumulating over 13,263 sanctions, mostly from the US and Switzerland, according to Castellum data.</p>

<p>Prominent pro-Ripple lawyer Jeremy Hogan has stressed the significance of addressing the contentious issue of &#8220;secondary market sales&#8221; of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-price-crosses-0-5-milestone-as-trading-volume-explodes-a-ripple-win-in-sec-case-imminent/">XRP</a> in the ongoing legal dispute between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>



<p>On Monday, Hogan also highlighted the significance of resolving the question of whether XRP is inherently classified as a security, as both of these issues directly influence XRP&#8217;s potential relisting on exchanges and the overall outcome of the case.</p>



<p>“<em>There has been discussion about how/if &#8220;secondary market sales&#8221; of XRP will (or won&#8217;t) be addressed in the Ripple case. It&#8217;s important because we are only confident XRP will be relisted on exchanges if the issue of whether XRP is inherently a security is addressed,” </em>Hogan <a href="https://twitter.com/attorneyjeremy1/status/1663082011358109698">tweeted</a>.</p>



<p>Notably, Hogan acknowledged the likelihood that the judge overseeing the case might not directly address the issue of securities stating the plaintiff did not explicitly raise it. However, he outlined scenarios that could address secondary sales concerns and influence the judge&#8217;s decision.</p>



<p>Firstly, the legal pundit proposed that Ripple could agree with the SEC to include language in the proposed final judgment, explicitly excluding secondary sales from its scope. According to him, this approach could clarify the treatment of secondary sales just like the precedent set by KIK Interactive&#8217;s case, where the SEC allowed language pertaining to continuing sales.</p>



<p>Secondly, the lawyer suggested that the judge consider the concerns raised by various amici, including those championed by XRP holders represented by attorney Deaton. In late March, attorney John Deaton predicted an &#8220;outright win&#8221; for Ripple while accusing the agency of significant overreach in the case. At the time, Deaton also <a href="https://zycrypto.com/why-pro-ripple-lawyer-says-xrp-cant-be-classed-as-a-security-even-if-it-was-sold-as-one/">expressed optimism</a> in Judge Analisa Torres&#8217; ruling that &#8220;XRP is not a security and ongoing and secondary sales are not securities.&#8221; He further emphasized that the judge recognized the importance of the public interest in reaching a decision, terming the amicus briefs and over 3500 affidavits filed by XRP holders as a “big deal”.</p>



<p>According to Hogan, Ripple could also benefit from the precedent set in the LBRY case, where the judge ruled earlier this year that Secondary sales are not securities, raising optimism that the judge in the XRP lawsuit may do the same.</p>



<p>That said, as the high-stakes lawsuit continues, the crypto community anxiously anticipates updates on secondary market sales, as a favourable ruling could potentially aid in XRP’s relisting on exchanges once the case concludes. This could have significant implications for cryptocurrency, potentially boosting its price to all-time highs after three rough years.</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC), the flagship asset of the cryptocurrency industry, has achieved remarkable success and widespread acceptance. However, Despite the significant achievements of Bitcoin, there are prominent critics who argue that it lacks inherent value.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoin-obituaries/">data</a> obtained from 99bitcoins, a cryptocurrency information platform, Bitcoin has faced 474 death declarations since its launch a decade ago, with 7 being made by prominent figures this year alone.</p>



<p>As per 99Bitcoins, for a declaration to qualify to be on the so-called “Bitcoin obituaries&#8221;, it must be produced by an individual with a notable following or a site with substantial traffic. It must also state explicitly that Bitcoin is or will become worthless without any ambiguous language such as &#8220;maybe&#8221; or &#8220;could.&#8221;</p>



<p>One of the earliest recorded predictions of Bitcoin&#8217;s demise dates back to December 15, 2010, when businessman Jordan Tuwiner, in an article titled &#8220;Why Bitcoin Can&#8217;t Be a Currency-The Underground Economist&#8221; expressed scepticism about its future. Notably, Bitcoin was trading at a mere $0.23 at the time of his post. Fortunately, Tuwiner recognized Bitcoin&#8217;s potential and subsequently changed his stance. He went on to found BuyBitcoinWorldwide in 2015, an educational resource for individuals interested in purchasing Bitcoin and entering the world of cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>Interestingly, Bitcoin was even declared dead during its peak success in November 2021, when its price reached $67,567. Sam Leith of The Spectator wrote an article titled &#8220;The Bitcoin Delusion&#8221;, drawing a comparison between Bitcoin and a ticking time bomb.</p>



<p>Other notable figures have also made pessimistic statements about Bitcoin, including TV personality Jim Cramer and former SEC attorney John Reed Stark referred to cryptocurrency as a &#8220;big hustle”, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-is-a-hyped-up-fraud-jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-asserts/">called</a> Bitcoin a &#8220;hyped-up fraud&#8221;, and geopolitical analyst Peter Zeihan who said <em>“bitcoin will probably go negative”</em> on the Joe Rogan podcast in January.</p>



<p>As per 99Bitcoins, the latest Bitcoin Euology comes from renowned tech investor Chamath Palihapitiya who stated in April that “Crypto is dead in America&#8221; when the price of Bitcoin was at $27,817.</p>



<p>Despite the numerous death declarations and negative sentiment expressed by these critics, Bitcoin has continued to demonstrate resilience and positive market performance. Notably, since the first recorded declaration by Tuwiner in 2010, Bitcoin’s value has surged over 11,700,000%.</p>



<p>That said, various individuals have predicted Bitcoin is poised to grow further, with experts such as Ari Paul, the CIO of blockchain firm BlockTower and Bloomberg’s senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bloombergs-top-strategist-sees-bitcoin-tapping-100000-in-a-matter-of-time-says-bottom-may-be-in/">predicting</a> that its price will reach $100,000 soon.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, at press time, Bitcoin was trading at $27,164 up roughly 1% in the past 24 hours. Notably, since January 1<sup>st,</sup> the cryptocurrency has surged about 65%, restoring optimism in the market.</p>

<p>Circle, the company behind the popular stablecoin <a href="https://zycrypto.com/circle-rolls-out-usdc-cross-chain-transfer-protocol-for-ethereum-and-avalanche-networks/">USDC</a>, has announced a trailblazing move that is set to revolutionize the Arbitrum blockchain. Circle intends to introduce the official version of USDC natively on the Arbitrum network as part of a strategic cooperation with Arbitrum, creating new opportunities for quick and easy transactions.</p>



<p>Circle intends to overcome the Ethereum network&#8217;s scalability issues and give users quicker and more affordable transactions by introducing USDC natively on Arbitrum.</p>



<p>This change comes as a huge decision for both Circle and the larger crypto ecosystem. Due to its transparency, stability, and regulatory compliance, USDC, the stablecoin backed by the US dollar, has experienced tremendous growth in recent years. USDC is set to grow in flexibility and accessibility with its native integration on Arbitrum.</p>



<p>The announcement by Circle has sparked excitement among cryptocurrency enthusiasts and experts. The company stated its delight in the partnership and the possible effects it might have on the industry. The combination of USDC and Arbitrum would offer a seamless user experience and open the door to new applications for decentralized finance (DeFi).</p>



<p>The Arbitrum protocol developed by Offchain Labs is one of the best layer 2 scaling solutions for Ethereum. It makes an effort to lessen network sluggishness and high gas prices while maintaining the security and decentralization of the Ethereum blockchain by processing transactions off-chain. Circle&#8217;s involvement and USDC&#8217;s inclusion will considerably benefit from Arbitrum&#8217;s technology.</p>



<p>It is believed that the native integration of USDC on Arbitrum will assist consumers in several ways. First of all, it will drastically lower transaction costs, enabling users to carry out transactions more quickly. Additionally, it will make confirmation times faster, enabling almost immediate USDC transfers on the Arbitrum network.</p>



<p>Additionally, the interoperability between various DeFi protocols will be improved through the integration of USDC with Arbitrum. By enabling frictionless USDC transfers between different applications on the Arbitrum network, users will increase the potential for decentralized finance and foster ecosystem innovation.</p>



<p>Circle&#8217;s decision to deploy USDC natively on Arbitrum demonstrates the ongoing efforts being made to overcome the scalability problems the Ethereum network is currently experiencing. By &#8220;rolling&#8221; together groups of transactions on a sidechain, it uses a technique known as optimistic rollup to report back to Ethereum with a single transaction.</p>



<p>Layer 1 blockchains, in this example Ethereum, are layered with Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum, which benefit from the security architecture of the former. These L2 solutions typically see a migration of users looking for lower prices and quicker transactions. However, customers must transfer money from L1 to L2 to accomplish this. This is what is commonly referred to as &#8220;bridging.&#8221;</p>



<p>The usage of stablecoins is expected to rise as a result of USDC&#8217;s integration with Arbitrum, which is also projected to accelerate the development of decentralized finance. Scalable and effective blockchain solutions are likely to advance in the future as Circle and Arbitrum collaborate to make this game-changing decision a reality.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-price-crosses-0-5-milestone-as-trading-volume-explodes-a-ripple-win-in-sec-case-imminent/">XRP Network</a> experienced a significant increase in address activity for two consecutive days, marking a historic milestone, as reported by the blockchain analysis platform, <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1663349921205088257?t=b15mJpgi45JSK_OJYoDUJA&amp;s=19">Santiment</a>.</p>



<p>The growing activity in addresses suggests the possibility of a rally for XRP, Ripple’s native cryptocurrency, as it has previously experienced a notable increase following a similar rise in address activity.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="641" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-3-1024x641.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81689" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-3-1024x641.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-3-300x188.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-3-768x481.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-3-1536x962.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-3.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-increased-address-activity-suggests-a-potential-45-price-rise-for-xrp"><strong>Increased address activity suggests a potential 45%+ price rise for XRP</strong></h2>



<p>XRP&#8217;s price has risen by about 15% in the past week, from $0.4434 to $0.5053, which it currently maintains at the time of writing.</p>



<p>The price increase is in line with the increase in network address activity. Therefore, as Santiment suggests, it is possible that the price of XRP could increase by over 40%, similar to what happened in March when address activity saw a similar rise.</p>



<p>Similarly, there appears to be a slight disconnect between XRP and the rest of the crypto market, as XRP&#8217;s price is rising while many other coins are not. This could be an indication of a potentially more decisive trend change.</p>



<p>Currently, XRP is in a psychological price zone ($0.50), where bulls and bears are battling to determine the victor. Unless the price of XRP breaks strongly out of this zone, it is challenging to continue with a significant bullish movement.</p>



<p>Currently, several indicators such as moving averages, the squeeze momentum indicator, VPVP, and ADX suggest continuing a bullish movement on daily timeframes, which could lead XRP to reach or even surpass the previous high of $0.6 achieved in late March 2023.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="614" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2-1024x614.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81688" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2-1024x614.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2-300x180.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2-768x461.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2.png 1145w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ripple&#8217;s potential legal win may boost XRP&#8217;s bullish trend</strong></h2>



<p>The spikes in address activity on the XRP network occur at a time when many enthusiasts suggest that Ripple could <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-army-shower-confidence-on-a-ripple-win-in-sec-case-as-whales-load-up-heavily/">win the lawsuit</a> brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the classification of XRP as a security.</p>



<p>Even Ripple&#8217;s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, has <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-sec-case-takes-surprising-turn-as-ripple-ceo-garlinghouse-expects-final-decision-in-weeks/">given optimistic signals</a> pointing to the case being resolved in a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-ripple-boss-confident-groundbreaking-verdict-is-coming-in-weeks-after-hinman-speech-docs-win/">few weeks</a>, which would help boost XRP&#8217;s price prospects by eliminating regulatory uncertainties.</p>



<p>Therefore, in the short term and according to several indicators, it is highly likely that XRP will experience a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/fomo-will-kick-into-high-gear-when-xrp-price-roars-past-2-predicts-pro-ripple-attorney">bullish movement</a>. Who knows, it may finally manage to emerge from the abyss created by U.S. regulatory pressure.</p>

<ul>
<li>Bitcoin has slipped below $27,000 to end May in the red zone as wider market factors stifle the expectations of bullish investors.</li>



<li>Loretta Mester, a Federal Reserve official, shares her opinion on potentially negative job and inflation data.</li>



<li>Observers suggest that investors should brace for a slight downturn in the market outlook as the Feds will resume tightening liquidity if the debt ceiling is raised.</li>
</ul>



<p>The digital asset market recorded slight gains last week but faces a huge test following macroeconomic factors, including inflation concerns, and reduced liquidity following the lifting of the debt ceiling.</p>



<p>May is officially Bitcoin’s (BTC) worst-performing month since the collapse of FTX in Nov 2022, putting investors in a risky position. BTC plunged by 7.3% in the last 30 days while the wider crypto market declined 5%, although some positives were recorded in altcoins. </p>



<p>Adding to the woes of BTC, a job report set to be released this week may wipe off little gains in the market. Loretta Mester, the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, stated in an interview with Financial Times that there is not enough evidence to pause the hikes in interest rates.</p>



<p>“<em>I don’t see a compelling reason to pause, meaning wait until you get more evidence to decide what to do.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Stressing that the Feds must do more to tackle inflation, her comments rattled traders dragging the market leader below $27,000. Furthermore, a report from the Jobs Opening and Labour Turnover (JOLTS) showed an increase in openings from 9.3 million to 10.01 million, justifying Mester&#8217;s arguments of a tight labour market.</p>



<p>There have been <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-bulls-set-eyes-above-30000-as-gold-taps-new-all-time-high/">reports</a> that the Feds could eventually pause the hike in interest rates with inflation cooling after ten previous hikes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-market-leaders-not-fazed-by-price-drop"><strong>Market leaders not fazed by price drop</strong></h2>



<p>The recent negatives recorded by BTC and other top assets have rattled traders, but several industry executives suggest that the major <a href="https://zycrypto.com/key-bitcoin-metrics-signal-potential-bull-run-despite-price-drop/">drivers</a> of BTC are waxing strong. Michael Silberberg of Alt Tab Capital noted that institutional investors are still attracted to the volatility in Bitcoin.</p>



<p><em>“This is a highly volatile market, which is one of the traits that attract institutional investors in the first place.”</em></p>



<p>Similarly, Mikkel Morch, an executive at Ark36, is not perturbed by the current macroeconomic effects on the market, adding that institutional interest and adoption point higher.</p>



<p>“<em>While short-term volatility persists due to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s tightening measures and ongoing global economic uncertainties, our stance at ARK36 remains bullish on Bitcoin for the long term,” </em>he explained.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tether, the company behind the world’s largest stablecoin by market cap <a href="https://zycrypto.com/demand-for-usdt-erupts-in-lebanon-as-rising-inflation-kicks-in/">USDT</a>, has achieved a remarkable feat by surpassing its previous all-time high market cap of $83.2 billion, which was achieved earlier last month.</p>



<p>In a Thursday, June 1st, blogpost, Paolo Ardoino, the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Tether, highlighted this notable accomplishment emphasizing its importance and describing it as a manifestation of people&#8217;s desire for financial independence.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Today&#8217;s numbers demonstrate that people want access to financial freedom, and when given that access, they will make use of it. Tether tokens offer a safe harbor for the unbanked and enable individuals in emerging markets to preserve their purchasing power, even when their national currency is experiencing devaluation,”</em> <a href="https://tether.to/en/tether-usdt-reaches-all-time-high-surpasses-previous-market-cap-high-of-832b/">said</a> Ardoino.</p>



<p>As per the blog, Tether’s market cap was partially catapulted by its exceptional performance in the first quarter, where it reported a net profit of $1.48 billion. Currently, the company’s reserves enjoy an impressive allocation of approximately 85% of investments in cash, cash equivalents, and other short-term deposits. Furthermore, with a 20% increase in token supply each quarter, Tether currently holds an extra $2.5 billion in reserves, exceeding the required minimum of 100%.</p>



<p>The firm has also been expanding its global reach, further underscoring the growing adoption of its stablecoin USDT, which is now the most traded cryptocurrency globally. Notably, in recent weeks, the stablecoin has surpassed the combined volume of all competing offerings, including USDC.</p>



<p>On May 31st, the firm announced its expansion in the republic of Georgia through a strategic investment in CityPay, a payment processing company that operates in various locations across the country, spanning over 600 establishments. The latest announcement brings Tether’s operations to over 120 countries worldwide with limited functionality in around 7 countries only.</p>



<p>Tether has also been expanding its endeavours beyond stablecoins, particularly emphasising <a href="https://zycrypto.com/tether-to-invest-15-of-its-net-monthly-profits-in-bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>, communication networks, and renewable energy ecosystems. Earlier this week, the firm revealed plans to commence sustainable Bitcoin mining operations in Uruguay, a move that is aimed at stimulating the adoption of cryptocurrencies and the creation of employment opportunities for the local communities.</p>



<p>That said, Tether&#8217;s remarkable achievement of surpassing the $83.2 billion market cap milestone, compared to just $66.2 billion at the beginning of the year, highlights the increasing adoption of stablecoins and the growing demand for defi transactions. With its continued expansion, particularly in emerging markets, it will be interesting to see whether it will maintain its leadership position within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p>

<p>Shiba Inu, the popular meme-based cryptocurrency, has been gaining significant attention lately as the highly-anticipated launch of Shibarium approaches. Network activity surrounding Shiba Inu has witnessed an impressive surge, with a staggering 2,538 new SHIB addresses created in a single day, marking the highest increase in three months. This surge in network activity indicates growing interest and excitement as the community eagerly awaits the launch of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inus-shibarium-triggers-explosive-momentum-for-0-001-shib-price-following-burn-portal-reveal/">Shibarium</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rising-network-activity-signals-enthusiasm"><strong>Rising Network Activity Signals Enthusiasm</strong></h2>



<p>The recent network data highlights the remarkable surge in Shiba Inu network activity.</p>



<p>The creation of 2,538 new SHIB addresses in a single day speaks volumes about SHIB&#8217;s enthusiasm and engagement. The Shiba Inu community is actively participating in the network, potentially paving the way for new opportunities and developments.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="695" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1024x695.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81666" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1024x695.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-300x203.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-768x521.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1536x1042.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2048x1389.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>One cannot overlook the significance of the highly-anticipated Shibarium launch in relation to the surge in network activity. Shibarium is an upcoming layer-2 blockchain network being developed within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, aiming to provide users with a secure and efficient blockchain ecosystem.</p>



<p>Shibarium is poised to revolutionize the Shiba Inu ecosystem by providing a dedicated platform for trading SHIB and exploring the world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The decentralized exchange component of Shibarium will allow users to trade SHIB tokens with ease, fostering liquidity and enabling seamless transactions within the Shiba Inu community. Additionally, the NFT marketplace will enable creators and collectors to engage in the vibrant world of digital art and collectibles, further expanding the utility and appeal of Shiba Inu.</p>



<p>The increasing network activity and the upcoming Shibarium launch have fueled a sense of anticipation and investor confidence within the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inus-community-heightens-token-burns-as-shibarium-renews-bullish-drive-for-0-001-shib/">Shiba Inu community</a>. The surge in new SHIB addresses indicates that more investors are seeking to participate in the ecosystem and potentially benefit from the forthcoming developments. This growing confidence is further reflected in the rising trading volumes and market capitalization of SHIB.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Community Excitement and Future Prospects</strong></h2>



<p>The escalating network activity and growing investor sentiment surrounding Shiba Inu indicate a thriving community that eagerly anticipates the launch of Shibarium. With increased SHIB addresses being created, it is evident that SHIB enthusiasts are positioning themselves to take advantage of the forthcoming platform&#8217;s potential. The excitement stems from the belief that Shibarium could potentially elevate the Shiba Inu project to new heights in terms of utility and market capitalization and further boost SHIB&#8217;s price to the highly-coveted $0.001 price point.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="647" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1-1024x647.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81667" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1-1024x647.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1-300x190.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1-1536x971.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1-2048x1294.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">SHIBUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SHIBUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Furthermore, the launch of Shibarium is expected to attract attention from crypto enthusiasts beyond the existing Shiba Inu community. The dedicated exchange and NFT marketplace offer unique opportunities for traders and collectors, potentially drawing new users to the ecosystem. This influx of participants has the potential to contribute to increased liquidity and trading volume, bolstering the overall health and growth of the Shiba Inu network.</p>

<p>On May 27, the municipal government of Beijing announced the release of a whitepaper providing information on Web3 innovation and development in China. It focuses on innovative research areas such as <a href="https://zycrypto.com/the-confluence-of-artificial-intelligence-ai-in-blockchain-technology/">artificial intelligence (AI)</a>, XR interactive terminals, and content production tools.</p>



<p>The Municipal Commission of Science and Technology of Beijing presented the whitepaper during the Zhongguancun Forum. Despite existing restrictions on cryptocurrencies, Beijing is showing interest in Web3 and plans to allocate 100 million yuan (approximately $14 million) annually until 2025 to drive various related initiatives.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-china-s-whitepaper-highlights-web3-industry-focus-areas"><strong>China&#8217;s whitepaper highlights Web3 industry focus areas</strong></h2>



<p>China&#8217;s whitepaper emphasizes key technologies like blockchain, VR, and AI for their industrial application in Web3. Additionally, it underscores the government&#8217;s intention to provide all necessary political support to accelerate technological advancements and foster rapid growth in the Web3 industry.</p>



<p>The whitepaper also mentions emerging applications, such as digital verifications and NFT collections, which have experienced rapid growth and development. It highlights the active involvement of social organizations related to Web3 and the gradual rationalization of the global capital market.</p>



<p>Moreover, Beijing aims to establish a leadership position in the country in terms of development policies and innovative companies by implementing comprehensive measures to accelerate the construction of an internationally competitive <a href="https://zycrypto.com/web3-lawyer-backs-ripple-amid-discovery-of-conversation-between-sec-staff-prior-to-the-hinman-speech/">Web3</a>. The city proposes to strengthen political support and organizational guarantees to achieve its objectives of standing out as an innovative city.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Will Hong Kong open its doors to cryptocurrencies?</strong></h2>



<p>Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance, <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1662334590332153868">commented</a> on the whitepaper release, noting that it is interesting that it coincides closely with June 1, the day on which new updates are expected regarding the regulatory framework on cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>The idea of Hong Kong legalizing cryptocurrencies may not be so far-fetched, considering that earlier this year, Paul Chan, the Financial Secretary of Hong Kong, announced the completion of the regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. Despite cryptocurrency volatility, he emphasized the government&#8217;s commitment to becoming a crypto hub.</p>



<p>Furthermore, during an April press conference, the secretary stated that for Web3 to continue its innovative development path, the government must adopt a strategy that &#8220;emphasizes both proper regulation and development promotion.&#8221;</p>



<p>This means that, unlike other countries like the United States, where regulations or the lack of clear regulations on the crypto ecosystem have led to the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/crypto-community-in-shock-as-bittrex-exchange-shuts-down-u-s-operations/">closure</a> of several cryptocurrency exchanges, Hong Kong plans to be less restrictive and more friendly to crypto companies.</p>

<ul>
<li>In four European countries, Binance will pause trading services for a dozen privacy coins, including Monero and Zcash.</li>



<li>The exchange cited regulatory compliance as the key reason for this development, with the EU pushing through with MiCA.</li>



<li>Users mull over the effect of delisting privacy coins which have gained traction in recent years following harsh regulations.</li>
</ul>



<p>Privacy coins like Monero and Zcash shield user identities and transactions from regulators but have been criticized for aiding money laundering and other illegal activities.</p>



<p>Binance has announced its decision to delist twelve privacy coins in France, Spain, Italy and Poland in the wake of new cryptocurrency regulations. The leading digital asset exchange will halt trading services for users in a dozen privacy coins from June 26.</p>



<p>The affected privacy coins include Monero (XMR), Verge (XVG), MobileCoin (MOB), Firo (FIRO), BEAM, Zcash (ZEC), Horizon (ZEN), Navcoin (NAV), PIVX, Secret (SCRT), Decred (DCR) and Dash (DASH).</p>



<p>The announcement comes when the European Union (EU) authorities have begun <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-holds-steady-as-eus-mica-regulation-gets-another-green-light/">enforcing</a> several aspects of the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework. MiCA is opposed to privacy coins unless such a company can verify the identity of its users. This is quite a stretch, as many have argued that it may defeat the purpose of privacy coins.</p>



<p>Some regulators within the EU have criticized cryptocurrencies for acting as a catalyst to boost money laundering operations and other illicit transactions worldwide. Binance stated that its decision to delist the assets was based on regulatory compliance, as the exchange aims to observe all laws in the financial market.</p>



<p><em>“As part of Binance’s ongoing compliance processes, we have reached out to affected users to notify them that they will no longer be able to purchase or trade privacy tokens on our platform,&#8221;​ </em>the statement reads. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-harsh-reactions-trail-binance-s-decision"><strong>Harsh reactions trail Binance’s decision</strong></h2>



<p>Although bad actors could use privacy coins for illegal transactions, users have argued that an outright ban is a reach for even the EU. Both digital asset users and the industry executives have criticized the move, with some calling it an “<em>attempt by regulators to undermine the sector one coin at a time.”</em></p>



<p>Despite expressing his disappointment, Guy Zyskind, Secret&#8217;s CEO noted that Secret is not essentially a privacy coin and should not be included in the ban.</p>



<p>“<em>Secret is not a privacy coin. We reached out to Binance to clarify this. Secret’s transactions are public, it’s data in smart contracts that remain confidential. In fact, Secret is much more appropriate for GDPR-type applications in the blockchain setting,” </em>he said.&nbsp;</p>
