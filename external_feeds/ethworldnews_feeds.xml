<p>In welcoming news for crypto fans, crypto exchange Coinbase has made the announcement today that it will be relisting XRP (XRP) on the XRP network subject to liquidity requirements being met. Trading of XRP is expected to commence later today. </p>



<p>Coinbase has planned to launch trading on its XRP USD, XRP USDT, and XRP EUR trading pairs in stages following the establishment of a suitable supply of this asset. The resumption of XRP trading on Coinbase comes after an absence spanning almost two years.</p>



<p>In January 2021  Coinbase had decided to delist $XRP from its platform due to concerns surrounding the security and regulatory status of this cryptocurrency. However, a recent ruling by a U.S. District Court judge has altered the landscape by asserting that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lacked authority in initiating enforcement action against Ripple Labs, the entity behind XRP.</p>



<p>This court ruling effectively paved the way for Coinbase to reinstate trading activities for XRP as it clarified that XRP does not meet the definition of a security according to the SECs guidelines. The SEC defines a security as &#8220;an investment contract,&#8221; which involves an arrangement facilitating investor anticipation for returns arising from others&#8217; dedicated efforts. The court established that there is no investment contract inherent in XPR therefore rendering it outside this classification.</p>



<p>Coinbases decision to relist brings about a significant triumph since it signifies their success in contesting the SECs position and clarifies that categorically, XRP should not be considered as a security</p>



<p><strong>For Ripple Labs.</strong></p>



<p>This positive development bears potential implications relating to increased adoption by mainstream investors moving forward. What does this signify for users of XRP?</p>



<p>The reinstatement of XRP trading on Coinbase brings forth constructive prospects for this cryptocurrency. Its return is predicted to enhance liquidity levels along with fostering more robust trade volume.</p>



<p>This outcome also contributes towards greater legitimacy within investor and regulatory circles.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, it remains imperative to bear in mind that XRP remains a highly fluctuating form of cryptocurrency. The cost of XRP may experience significant fluctuations in the near future. It is important for investors to carefully consider the associated risks before deciding to invest in XRP.</p>

<ul><li>The judge overseeing the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple has ruled that XRP cannot be considered an investment contract.&nbsp;</li><li>Crypto leaders including Gemini’s Cameron Winklevoss and Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson congratulated Ripple for its victory.&nbsp;</li><li>XRP has gained more than 55% following the highly anticipated summary judgment by Judge Analisa Torres.&nbsp;</li><li>The judgment paves the way for crypto assets like ADA, MATIC, and SOL to be identified as non-security tokens.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The judge overseeing the Securities and Exchange Commission’s lawsuit against Ripple handed a major victory to the latter earlier today after she ruled that XRP couldn’t be qualified as an investment contract. The summary judgment by New York Judge Analisa Torres cleared up the long-standing debate on whether XRP was a security. According to Judge Torres, none of XRP’s sales barring the institutional ones, can be considered securities. </p>



<h2><strong>Charles Hoskinson, Justin Sun &amp; Cameron Winklevoss Celebrate Ripple’s Victory</strong></h2>



<p>The landmark <a href="https://twitter.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1679514554433257474" rel="nofollow noopener">judgment</a> by federal judge Analisa Torres prompted the most high-profile stakeholders in the crypto industry to celebrate Ripple’s victory. Congratulations poured in from leading crypto personalities, including Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson and Tron founder Justin Sun. The crypto leaders highlighted the positive implications of Judge Torres’ summary judgment in the closely watched lawsuit. </p>



<p>SDNY Judge Analisa Torres ruled earlier today that Ripple’s Programmatic Sales and other distributions of XRP did not constitute the offer and sale of investment contracts. However, the federal judge did point out that the institutional sales of XRP constituted the unregistered offer and sale of investment contracts in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act. Hoskinson took to Twitter earlier today to acknowledge the impact of Ripple’s victory in crypto space and referred to it as a “giant leap for cryptocurrencies”. Tron founder Justin Sun also congratulated Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and his team. Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss was also among the joggers. </p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The sale of XRP on exchanges is NOT a security.

</div></figure>



<p> The summary judgment by Judge Torres also led to a 73% rally in XRP’s price. At the time of writing, XRP was trading at $0.80. The summary judgment also set a key legal precedent for the <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/paradigm-amicus-brief-in-sec-v-bittrex/">SEC</a>’s ongoing lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase, which identified several tokens including ADA, SOL, and MATIC as securities.&nbsp;These tokens had a visible uptick in their prices following the summary judgment in SEC v Ripple. </p>

<ul><li>Bitget’s monthly proof of reserves showed that it had a reserve ratio of a whopping 223%.</li><li>The crypto exchange claimed that it had no outstanding debts or liabilities and had a reserve of $1.4 billion.&nbsp;</li><li>The exchange’s reserve ratios have reportedly exceeded 200% for the past seven months.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Singapore-based Bitget recently published its proof of reserves (PoR) which showed a total reserve ratio of 223%. The crypto exchange claimed that this was a new industry benchmark, with the current industry standard at 100%. The exchange also highlighted its debt-free status, claiming that its operations did not rely on loans or users’ funds.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Bitget’s Reserve Ratio Exceeded 200% For Seven Months</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/07/13/2704386/0/en/Bitget-s-Latest-Proof-of-Reserves-Sets-New-Industry-Benchmark-with-223-Ratio.html" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> by Bitget, the latest proof of reserves reflected its commitment to “radical transparency”. The crypto exchange further revealed that it was proudly debt-free and didn’t have to rely on debt or users’ funds for the platform’s transactions or investments. As per the PoR breakdown, the reserve ratio for USD Coin (<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/circle-layoffs-focus-on-core-activities/">USDC</a>) was a whopping 2604%. Bitcoin (BTC), Tether USD (USDT), and Ether (ETH) had reserve ratios of 454%, 135%, and 171%, respectively.  The exchange claimed to have consistently maintained a reserve ratio of over 200% for seven months. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Bitget has no outstanding debts or liabilities and is not listed as a creditor for any recently bankrupt companies. This enables us to efficiently cover users’ assets without depending on external bureaucracy or policy changes.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Bitget clarified that the high collateralization of certain crypto assets was due to the profit from transaction fees as well as returns on investments and acquisitions. The crypto exchange completed its registration in Lithuania in April this year. In the interest of transparency and consumer protection, the exchange plans to tap multiple audit firms to maintain the integrity of its reserves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bitget also has a $300 million user protection fund, which makes up for the lack of external insurance for the platform’s users. Managing Director Gracy Chen stated that the exchange would continue to release proof of reserves and prioritize financial and technical stability to set higher standards for the crypto industry.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>The New York Attorney General and the CFTC accused Alex Mashinky&#8217;s Celsius of rule-breaking. &#8216;</li><li>A court-appointed examiner said the trouble crypto firm operated similarly to a pyramid scheme.</li><li>Court documents also show that CEO Alex Mashinsky and other executives <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/celsius-recover-millions-alex-mashinsky/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/celsius-recover-millions-alex-mashinsky/" rel="noreferrer noopener">withdrew</a> millions from the company leading up to the crash in 2022.</li><li>The SEC is on a marauding crackdown with lawsuits against other entities like Binance and Coinbase.</li></ul>



<p>Bankrupt crypto firm Celsius and founder Alex Mashinsky are being sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), per <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-13/sec-files-lawsuit-against-celsius-network-alex-mashinsky?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_content=crypto&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_medium=social#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-13/sec-files-lawsuit-against-celsius-network-alex-mashinsky?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_content=crypto&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_medium=social#xj4y7vzkg" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>. </p>



<p>The SEC&#8217;s complaint alleges that Mashinsky deceived investors about the company&#8217;s finances and used unregistered crypto asset securities to raise billions of dollars. Federal prosecutors claimed that Celsius manipulated the price of its own native token CEL.</p>



<p>Mashinsky, who Justice Department prosecutors say was the architect of intricately organized fraud, faces criminal charges on seven counts in Southern District of New York court. </p>



<p>Thursday&#8217;s filing in Manhattan follows a flurry of lawsuits from federal regulators against crypto businesses and operations in the U.S. The SEC recently sued two crypto&#8217;s largest exchanges &#8211; <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-sues-coinbase-after-binance/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-sues-coinbase-after-binance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance and Coinase</a>.</p>



<h2>Regulators Sue Celsius</h2>



<p>New York Attorney General Letitia James accused Mashinsky and his company of fraud. In January, an independent court-appointed examiner reported that the crypto lender operated like a Ponzi scheme. </p>



<p>The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) also told a court tha that<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/cftc-celsius-alex-mashinsky-broke-rules/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/cftc-celsius-alex-mashinsky-broke-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Celsius&#8217;s founder and the bankrupt crypto company broke commodities </a>rules. Mashinsky insisted that the products his firm offered were neither securities nor commodities.</p>



<h2>Mashinsky&#8217;s Risky Bets</h2>



<p>Celsius once boasted $30 billion in assets before the crypto lender imploded last year. The examiner&#8217;s report said Mashinsky&#8217;s company made dangerous investments using customer funds as capital. </p>



<p>Mashinsky resigned in September months after Celsius filed for Chapter 11 protection last July and the company currently owes billions in crypto to investors, court documents show. </p>



<p>Mashinsky&#8217;s company lists among high-profile collapses from 2022 alongside firms like Do Kwon&#8217;s Terraform Labs, and Three Arrows Capital, the failed crypto hedge fund founded by Su Zhu and Kyle Davies. </p>

<ul><li>TON blockchain’s Wallet has enabled in-app crypto payments for merchants on Telegram.&nbsp;</li><li>Merchants can now send and receive USDT, BTC, and TON on the messaging app.&nbsp;</li><li>Wallet’s existing crypto payment services for users on the app have attracted just 0.3% of its 700 million users.&nbsp;</li><li>TON’s Wallet payments solution initially integrated crypto payments in the app in April 2022.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Wallet, the crypto payment service built on The Open Network (TON) blockchain, has enabled in-app crypto payments for merchants on Telegram. The payment service is already integrated into the messaging app and will now allow merchant payments via multiple cryptocurrencies. The expansion to merchant crypto payments comes more than a year after the TON added crypto payments for users on the messaging app.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Less Than 0.3% of Telegram&#8217;s Users Utilized Wallet’s Crypto Payment Service</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/07/13/telegram-merchants-gain-to-access-crypto-payments-for-first-time/" rel="nofollow noopener">CoinDesk</a>, Wallet will allow merchants on Telegram to integrate crypto into its bots within chats in order to send and receive crypto payments. As of now, the payment service has enabled support for just three cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/silk-road-bitcoins-moved-cpi/">BTC</a>), Tether USD (USDT), and toncoin (TON). No visible change was seen in the price of BTC following the announcement. Meanwhile, TON saw a short-lived rally of over 1.5% and was trading at $1.33 at press time. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>In the past, DIY solutions have been available in the form of relatively primitive bots with links to cryptocurrency payment systems or similar products attached to them. With WalletPay, merchants can now seamlessly accept cryptocurrency payments within the Telegram app, with features available such as the ability to make payments directly within chats.”</p></blockquote>



<p>TON’s Wallet payments solution initially enabled crypto payments in Telegram back in April 2022. Wallet opened the doors for in-app crypto payments for the app’s 550 million users at the time. Despite being active for more than a year, the crypto payment service has not attracted a lot of users. Wallet stated that just 2 million of Telegram’s over 700 million users (0.3%) were using the crypto payment feature.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ethereum scaling network Polygon <a href="https://t.co/ksfA2v1Bts" data-type="URL" data-id="https://t.co/ksfA2v1Bts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">proposed</a> switching out its native token MATIC for a new coin dubbed POL in a move designed to improve interoperability and multichain validation for users across the protocol&#8217;s layer 2 ecosystem. </p>



<p>Polygon Labs, the company behind MATIC and the scaling solution it is built on, announced the proposal on Thursday as part of &#8220;Roadmap 2.0&#8221;. </p>



<h2>Polygon&#8217;s New POL Token</h2>



<p>The new POL token would be accessible across the company&#8217;s <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/polygon-proposal-pos-chain-zk-compatible/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/polygon-proposal-pos-chain-zk-compatible/" rel="noreferrer noopener">basket of chains</a> like the zkEVM network, Supernets, and its Proof of Stake (PoS) network if the community approves this plan.  POL would operate as an asset that users can stake within Polygon&#8217;s ecosystem to earn rewards. </p>



<p>According to the team, POL also introduces multichain validation functionality and allows holders to access rewards by contributing as validators. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>POL is the 3rd generation of native assets &#8211; a hyperproductive token. Holders can become validators and receive rewards but with two major improvements &#8211; Validators can validate MULTIPLE CHAIN and Chains can offer MULTIPLE ROLES (and corresponding rewards) to validators.</p></blockquote>



<p>The team said MATIC holders will have at least four years to swap their old tokens for the new POL coin. To do this, users need to send their MATIC to a smart contract provided by the protocol. Users will then receive an equal number of tokens in a 1:1 ratio. No changes to token supply or tokenomics were shared by the team. </p>



<p>The new token could roll out within the next couple of months if the community approves the plan and gives the green light, the team also said. MATIC was up 4% following the news on Thursday. </p>

<p>Binance Labs has invested a whopping $15 million in leading Web3 gaming platform Xterio. As the venture capital and incubation arm of the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance Labs’ support for Xterio will allow the Switzerland-based game development firm to enhance its game development capabilities in artificial intelligence and Web3 and resolve AI provenance issues in Web3.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Binance Labs’ Investment Will Accelerate Xterio’s Token Launch</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/binance-labs-commits-$15-million-into-xterio-ecosystem-to-expand-its-game-development-capabilities-in-ai-and-web3-1674838563596230735" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a> on Binance’s official Website, the Xterio ecosystem is expanding faster than ever. The Web3 gaming startup leverages the power of artificial intelligence to bridge free-to-play genres with on-chain gaming. The long-term strategic partnership with the crypto giant will allow Xterio to expand its tech and further integrate artificial intelligence into its products. The investment will be used to accelerate the development of games incubated by Xterio. </p>



<p><a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-executives-quit-changpeng-zhao/">Binance</a> co-founder Yi He stated that Xterio’s core team consisted of experienced professionals from the Web2 and Web3 spaces. He, who also heads the crypto exchange’s investment arm, added that the gaming platform would also use the investment to develop games incubated by its partners. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“In partnership with Binance Labs, we envision unlimited potential, and aim to reinforce our position as a leading Web3-focused publisher with a global reach, utilizing our East and West teams.” </p><cite>Michael Tong, co-founder of Xterio</cite></blockquote>



<p>The investment from Binance Labs will also accelerate Xterio’s token launch. The token will eventually become a part of the BNB Chain ecosystem and support the Web3 gaming startup’s growth. Xterio’s founding team consists of seasoned leaders from popular gaming giants including Electronic Arts, Activision, Ubisoft, Blizzard, and NetEase. The firm is currently developing an AI toolkit that generates style-consistent, production-quality 2D and 3D assets.</p>

<ul><li>Google has rolled out native support for tokenized digital assets in apps and games on the play store.&nbsp;</li><li>The tech giant will allow developers to offer games and apps enabled with trading of NFTs.&nbsp;</li><li>Experts saw the latest policy change as a positive step for the crypto space.&nbsp;</li><li>Reddit partnered with Google to help update the play store’s policy for digital assets.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Google has rolled out native support for tokenized digital assets like non-fungible tokens for apps and games on its play store. In a major policy overhaul, the tech giant will allow developers to offer games and apps that would allow users to buy and sell or earn tokenized assets. Google’s change in stance towards <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bitcoin-nfts-added-to-binance-marketplace/">NFTs</a> came as a positive sign for investors, artists, and other stakeholders in the space. </p>



<h2><strong>Reddit Helped Google Update Its NFT Policy</strong></h2>



<p>Google stated in a recent <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/07/new-blockchain-based-content-opportunities-google-play.html" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a> that the decision to update the policy on tokenized digital assets was taken in order to support developers that wanted to offer a creative and immersive in-app experience to users. Google Play’s policy was accordingly updated to allow the transaction of blockchain-based assets within the applications and games. The move is expected to boost user loyalty via NFT rewards and reimagine traditional games with unique user-owned content. </p>



<p>Interestingly, social networking giant Reddit and game developer Mythical Games lent a helping hand to Google to overhaul the policy on NFTs in order to offer transparent and responsible engagement with blockchain-based digital content. The companies collaborated to set clear guidelines to promote the safe usage of blockchain technology.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We think these new policies are steps forward for both players and developers alike and will positively impact the adoption of new technology while also protecting consumers.&#8221; </p><cite>John Linden, CEO, Mythical Games</cite></blockquote>



<p>Joseph Mills, a product manager at Google Play, stated that developers who decide to incorporate tokenized digital assets like NFTs on their apps and games would be required to declare the blockchain elements. Furthermore, Google Play will not allow NFT-enabled apps and games that include trading or gambling activities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Circle Internet Financial, the crypto giant behind the second-largest stablecoin in the world, has announced layoffs. The USDC issuer reduced its workforce and pulled investments from non-core activities in a bid to strengthen its balance. The layoffs came just five months after the firm stated that it would increase its workforce by 25% amid a reduction of workforce at fellow crypto firms.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Circle Will Continue To Hire Globally In Key Areas Of Focus </strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/crypto-firm-circle-cut-workforce-focus-core-activities-2023-07-12/" rel="nofollow noopener">Reuters</a>, Circle’s decision to cut its workforce was part of a broader shift in priorities. The USDC issuer stated that it would focus on core business activities and execution. Layoffs were announced in order to reduce operational headcount and help maintain a strong balance sheet. However, the stablecoin giant stated that it had identified new areas for investment and would continue to hire in key areas of focus globally. </p>



<p>With the decision to cut the workforce, <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/fdic-circle-sequoia-svb-top-depositors/">Circle</a> joined fellow crypto firms like Coinbase, Gemini, and Chainalysis, who announced layoffs earlier this year due to a high-interest rate environment and the prolonged crypto winter. Interestingly, Circle’s Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Fox-Green revealed earlier this year that the company was looking to hire more than 200 workers in 2023. </p>



<p>“We are growing and investing and we are fortunate to be in a financial position to be able to sustain our investments,” Fox-Green told the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-company-circle-focuses-on-growth-after-canceled-spac-merger-e446f779" rel="noopener">WSJ</a> at the time. The decision to increase the workforce by 25% represented a lower growth rate as compared to 2022 when the firm doubled its headcount from the previous year. </p>

<p>Canadian crypto <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/tether-el-salvador-1-billion-btc-mining/">mining</a> firm HIVE Blockchain has rebranded as HIVE Digital Technologies in a major pivot to artificial intelligence and web3. The Vancouver-based firm dumped blockchain from its name in a bid to reflect it&#8217;s evolving focus on its mission to drive advancements in artificial intelligence applications such as ChatGPT in order to support the new web3 ecosystem. </p>



<h2><strong>HIVE To Use Its Nvidia Graphics Cards For Cloud Computing</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://hivedigitaltechnologies.com/news/hive-digital-technologies-debuts-new-name-and-strategic-expansion-to-power-the-future-of-artificial-intelligence-with-our-nvidia-gpu-cards/" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> from HIVE Digital Technologies, the pivot represented the former crypto miner’s evolving focus on revenue opportunities with its Nvidia graphics processing unit (GPU) cards in the field of cloud computing. The firm plans to employ its fleet of 38,000 graphics cards for computational tasks on a large scale. The strategic shift in priorities will also include a focus on machine learning, and advanced data analysis in order to increase revenue. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>As we expand our GPU Cloud business, we require a strategy that better reflects both sides of our business. We build infrastructure for emerging digital tech, not just blockchain, and we intend to utilize our large fleet of GPUs to grow a cloud hosting business. We believe AI and machine learning are going to drive significant demand for GPU compute going forward.” </p><cite>Aydin Kilic, President, and Chief Executive Officer</cite></blockquote>



<p>HIVE Digital Technologies also plans to launch a new service called HIVE Cloud, which will be used to rent out the company’s GPU server clusters. This business model aims to compete with major cloud service providers that cater to small and medium business owners. The company’s stock lost more than 4% throughout the day and closed at $5.66. Trading was halted in light of the latest development.</p>
