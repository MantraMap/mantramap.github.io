<p>X.AI, an advanced AI model specialised in crypto and blockchain, announced its official launch. Elon Musk serves as its director. </p>
<p>X.AI, an advanced artificial intelligence system designed for cryptocurrency and blockchain, officially announced its launch on May 3. The company debuted X.AI GPT, an AI system based on machine learning and natural language processing designed to understand context and generate text for crypto use cases.</p>
<p>News of X.AI was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, which said the company was incorporated in March, and Elon Musk serves as a company director. Jared Birchall, the director of Musk&rsquo;s family office, is listed as X.AI&rsquo;s secretary.</p>
<p>Martin Winward, CEO of X.AI, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are excited to introduce X AI GPT to the blockchain community. This AI model has been trained on massive datasets to gain a deep understanding of cryptocurrencies, DeFi, NFTs, and the metaverse. Developers and businesses can now leverage the power of AI to elevate their crypto products and services.&rdquo;</p>

<p>X.AI GPT is built on OpenAI&rsquo;s GPT-3 language model and uses a technique called self-attention to analyse the relationship between words in a sentence. The model identifies patterns and understands context, and uses its abilities to create coherent and meaningful text. According to its press release, X.AI has customised its GPT model with domain-specific datasets in the crypto space.</p>
<p>Winward also said:</p>

<p>GPT-3 demonstrated the possibilities of generative AI, but it lacked the crypto-native knowledge and context awareness for blockchain applications. With X.AI GPT, we have built an AI that understands crypto inside and out, so it can generate content that resonates with the blockchain community.</p>

<p>The company&rsquo;s CEO added, &ldquo;Crypto is an ideal space for AI to make an impact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>X.AI has identified several use cases for its AI system, including AI writers and communicators, smart contract generators, DeFi tools, NFT creators, and conversational AI bots for crypto customer support. The company said developers could access X.AI GPT API and build their own apps atop the AI model.</p>
Musk Openly Opposes OpenAI
<p>Elon Musk opened up on views against OpenAI, the AI organisation he co-founded in 2015 with Sam Altman, CEO of Y Combinator, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, and Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel. Musk stepped away from the ChatGPT creator in 2018.</p>
<p>Since ChatGPT launched, Musk has openly disputed with Altman over the censorship of ChatGPT&rsquo;s responses with what OpenAI deems harmful prompts, Forbes reports.</p>
<p>As an advocate for free speech, Musk tweeted saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The danger of training AI to be woke &ndash; in other words, lie &ndash; is deadly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Twitter CEO even went as far as to sign a letter demanding a pause on &ldquo;giant AI experiments,&rdquo; according to reports by The Verge.</p>
