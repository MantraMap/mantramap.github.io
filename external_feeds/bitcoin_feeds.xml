Among the entities he mentioned were the U.S. departments of Education, Commerce and Energy, and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).</strong></p>
<h2>If Elected, DeSantis Administration Would Abolish the Departments of Commerce and Energy, Education, and the IRS</h2>
<p>During an interview with Fox News television host Martha MacCallum on Wednesday, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/florida-governor-ron-desantis-joins-us-presidential-race-promises-to-protect-bitcoin/">Ron DeSantis</a>, the Republican governor of Florida and a candidate in the 2024 U.S. presidential race, shared his idea to streamline the federal government by eliminating certain agencies. DeSantis expressed his firm support for reducing the overall size of government and expressed his intention to dismantle a select few departments if elected president.</p>
<p>&#8220;We would do Education, we would do Commerce, we&#8217;d do Energy, and we would do IRS,” DeSantis <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/desantis-outlines-drug-smuggling-policy-cut-through-wall-end-up-stone-cold-dead">told</a> MacCallum. “If Congress will work with me on doing that, we&#8217;ll be able to reduce the size and scope of government.” The Republican presidential candidate added:</p>
<blockquote><p>If Congress won&#8217;t go that far, I&#8217;m going to use those agencies to push back against woke ideology and against the leftism that we see creeping into all institutions of American life.</p></blockquote>
<p>DeSantis is not alone in his pledge to dismantle specific federal departments as a presidential candidate. A similar stance was taken by former Republican presidential contender Ron Paul during his 2012 campaign. Paul made a bold promise to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/id/44942719">abolish five cabinet-level agencies</a> should he win the election. The agencies he specifically targeted were Education, Interior, Commerce, Energy, and Housing and Urban Development.</p>
<p>&#8220;In order to get back to growth again you have to get rid of all the mistakes, all of the malinvestments, all of the debt,&#8221; Paul said at the time. &#8220;You can&#8217;t keep dumping the debt onto people.&#8221;</p>

<p>This also isn&#8217;t the first instance where DeSantis has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/2024-us-presidential-candidate-ron-desantis-says-irs-is-corrupt-insisting-america-needs-something-totally-different/">expressed his views</a> on revamping or dismantling the IRS. In a conversation with Dana Loesch in late May, he voiced his support for a single-rate tax proposal or a flat tax system. &#8220;I&#8217;ve endorsed all of the single-rate proposals,&#8221; DeSantis emphasized during his discussion with Loesch. &#8220;I truly believe they would bring significant improvements compared to the existing system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Building on his stance, DeSantis didn&#8217;t mince words when he asserted that he perceives the IRS as a “corrupt” entity, highlighting that this cabinet-level agency is far from being an ally to the ordinary citizen or taxpayer. During his conversation with MacCallum on Wednesday, he voiced his belief in the necessity of a profound reconstitution of the government. Reflecting on the unfulfilled promise of draining the swamp back in 2016, DeSantis offered a more potent metaphor, suggesting the urgent need to shatter the very foundations of the swamp itself.</p>
<p>He emphasized, &#8220;We need to fundamentally re-constitutionalize the government. We talked about draining the swamp in 2016; that didn’t happen. I think the better analogy is breaking the swamp.”</p>

<p>Friday&#x2019;s surge also led to a breakout of a key price ceiling at $30,800.</p>
<p>This appears to be due to the relative strength index (RSI) running into its own resistance level at the 70.00 mark.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> is trading at $30,831.12.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) climbed above the $1,900 mark earlier in the day, however traders have already moved to consolidate gains.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD briefly rose to an intraday high of $1,906.37 on Friday, but has since tailed off, and is now trading at $1,891.36.</p>
<p>Friday&#x2019;s peak saw the world&#x2019;s second largest cryptocurrency come close to a collision with the resistance level at $1,910.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, the RSI also neared a ceiling of its own, as it approached the 58.00 point of resistance.</p>
<p>In the event this level is broken, there is a strong possibility that ethereum could move beyond $1,930.</p>

Coinbase alleges that the institution lacks &#8220;any powers to regulate&#8221; cryptocurrency exchanges and that this enforcement action &#8220;offends due process and the constitutional separation of powers.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Coinbase Contests SEC Powers to Regulate Cryptocurrency Exchanges</h2>
<p>Paul Grewal, CLO of Coinbase, the largest U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange, <a href="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1674271484263661569?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the filing of an answer to the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-becomes-the-latest-target-of-sec-accused-of-unregistered-brokerage-and-securities-violations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complaint</a> presented by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), where the institution accuses the Coinbase of unregistered securities brokerage.</p>
<p>In the 177-page <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/c5bd0wqjc7v0/4oVJN5EioULD0QnSyg01b8/2b1f34594a800c727fb61a384f37e74a/SEC_v._Coinbase__Coinbase_Answer_to_Complaint__As-Filed_.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">document</a>, Coinbase explains that in April 2021, the SEC approved its registration to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-ipo-reference-price-250-nasdaq-listing-watershed-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">go public</a> through an IPO on Nasdaq, &#8220;allowing Coinbase&#8217;s shares to be sold to millions of retail and institutional investors.&#8221; However, the recent filing of this enforcement action against the exchange contradicts the prior approval of its business model.</p>
<p>Coinbase criticizes the newfound position of the institution regarding cryptocurrency exchanges, stating that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No statute enacted since April 2021 gives the SEC any powers to regulate digital asset exchanges, much less retroactively. The only change is in the SEC’s position regarding its powers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, the filing claims that this enforcement action, based on the SEC&#8217;s change of face, &#8220;offends due process and the constitutional separation of powers.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Gensler vs. Gensler</h2>
<p>The document also presents a timeline of how the views of SEC Chair Gary Gensler changed on the SEC&#8217;s faculties in the cryptocurrency space. Coinbase explains that in May 2021, Gensler testified before Congress stating the SEC &#8220;lacked statutory authority to regulate businesses like Coinbase,&#8221; putting the responsibilities of this task on Congress, citing a &#8220;regulatory gap.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, Gensler&#8217;s positions changed over time, and according to Coinbase, by the end of 2022, he stated: &#8220;I feel that we have enough authority, I really do, in this space,&#8221; for requiring crypto companies to register as securities exchanges.</p>
<p>About this, Coinbase&#8217;s filing declares:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The SEC also now asserts the authority to extract punitive retroactive penalties from companies for failure to recognize powers its own Chair was disclaiming two years ago.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Coinbase concluded that even if the SEC&#8217;s changes regarding securities were &#8220;colorable,&#8221; the <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12077" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major questions doctrine</a>, a U.S. legal principle that states courts will presume that Congress does not delegate to executive agencies issues of major political or economic significance, would require courts to reject this construction.</p>

The injunction also requires Ackerman to pay $27 million in restitution to defrauded victims and a civil monetary penalty of $27 million.</strong></p>
<h2>Only $10 Million Was Used to Trade Digital Commodity Assets</h2>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced on June 28 that a default judgment granting a permanent injunction has been issued against Michael Ackerman, the operator of a fraudulent digital asset trading scheme. According to the commission, the injunction granted by Naomi Reice Buchwald, a judge with a U.S. District Court, bars Ackerman from trading on regulated markets and registering with the CFTC.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8732-23?utm_source=govdelivery">statement</a> also revealed that Ackerman, who was sentenced to five years of probation with a year of home confinement in Feb. 2022, will also be required to &#8220;pay $27 million in restitution to defrauded victims.&#8221; Ackerman was further hit with a civil monetary penalty of $27 million for operating the fraudulent scheme.</p>
<p>As per the CFTC statement, the case against Ackerman stems from his alleged role in operating a fraudulent scheme which &#8220;solicited and misappropriated funds to purportedly trade digital commodity assets.&#8221; Although he managed to successfully extract an estimated $33 million from some 150 individuals and entities, Ackerman only used $10 million to trade. According to the Commission, Ackerman is thought to have used the remaining funds for &#8220;personal use or to prolong the fraudulent trading scheme.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">
<h2>Injunction Orders May Not Lead to Recovery of Funds</h2>
<p>The CFTC also accused Ackerman of lying to his victims about the monthly returns he was generating via the fraudulent trading scheme. In order to hide the fraud, Ackerman allegedly provided his customers with &#8220;false accounting statements, newsletters containing false trading returns, and fictitious screenshots of the amount of money under management.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the CFTC also used the announcement to warn victims of fraudulent digital asset scams that injunction orders may not lead to the recovery of funds.</p>
<p>&#8220;The CFTC cautions that orders requiring payment of funds to victims may not result in the recovery of any money lost because wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable,&#8221; the CFTC said.</p>

Revix said the move to block customers&#8217; access to 24% of their crypto assets was made after one of its primary service providers Haru Invest suspended deposits and withdrawals. </strong></p>
<h2>Impact of Haru Invest&#8217;s Abrupt Suspension of Deposits and Withdrawals</h2>
<p>Revix, the South African crypto investment platform, said on June 28 that it has rendered &#8220;24% of crypto asset balances held on the Revix platform as of Tuesday, 13th June, at 02:00 GMT+2 as reserved.&#8221; The decision means Revix customers can only withdraw 76% of their crypto assets which are stored on the platform.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://revix.com/blog/post/important-update">statement</a> explaining the rationale behind the move, Revix said the unexpected suspension of deposits and withdrawals by one of its primary service providers Haru Invest prompted the decision to reserve 24% of customers’ crypto assets. The statement revealed that &#8220;Haru is part of this system and holds a portion of Revix-controlled customer assets.&#8221;</p>
<p>Announcing its own decision to suspend deposit and withdrawals services, Haru Invest <a href="https://support.haruinvest.com/hc/en-us/articles/19582168987289">said</a> the recent discovery of irregularities in management reports submitted by B&amp;S Holdings had compelled it to act. Haru Invest also told its investors and customers on June 14 that it has since filed a criminal complaint against B&amp;S Holdings (formerly Aventus) and would soon follow up with a civil action.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://thebittimes.com/korean-authorities-ban-travel-for-haru-invest-delio-b-s-holdings-execs-tbt52896.html">reports</a> in South Korean media, Haru Invest’s decision to suspend services has also affected another digital exchange platform Delio. In addition, Korean authorities have imposed travel bans on some executives of B&amp;S Holdings, Delio, and Haru Invest.</p>
<h2>Customers Still Have Access to 100% of Fiat Deposits</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, in its statement, Revix characterized the decision to suspend the withdrawal of a portion of the customers’ crypto funds as the &#8220;most appropriate course of action to best mitigate the obvious adverse impact of this matter.&#8221; The exchange platform added:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have taken rigorous measures to protect them by securely moving all of our customers’ assets into protected internal custody. Customer assets — comprising 76% of their crypto holdings and 100% of their fiat cash balances — are fully accessible to customers whenever needed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Revix added that the discussions it has had with the Haru Invest team have given it hope that the crypto assets held by the South Korean platform will eventually be recovered.</p>

<h2>Accommodating Digital Assets as They Evolve</h2>
<p>The United Kingdom independent body, the Law Commission of England and Wales, has published its &#8220;recommendations for reform and development of the law on digital assets.&#8221; In a <a href="https://www.lawcom.gov.uk/new-recommendations-for-reform-and-development-of-the-law-on-digital-assets-to-secure-uks-position-as-global-crypto-hub/">statement</a>, the statutory body added that the recommendations, which seek to help secure the U.K.’s position as a global crypto hub, are intended &#8220;to provide a comprehensive legal foundation for digital assets which will allow these new technologies to flourish.&#8221;</p>
<p>The recommendations also supposedly seek to enable &#8220;a diverse range of market participants to interact with and benefit from&#8221; the tech and digital assets.</p>
<p>The Law Commission’s latest statement on digital assets came just under a year after it released a consultation paper proposing to reform the law relating to digital assets. As <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/uk-law-commission-publishes-proposals-to-reform-laws-relating-to-digital-assets-says-reforms-must-not-stifle-development/">reported</a> by Bitcoin.com News in late July 2022, the commission’s publication of the consultation paper followed a request by the government asking it &#8220;to review the law on digital assets, to ensure that it can accommodate them as they continue to evolve and expand.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<h2>Ensuring the Law Remains &#8216;a Flexible Tool That Enables Further Technological Innovation&#8217;</h2>
<p>Commenting on the Commission’s digital asset regulation recommendations, Sarah Green, Law Commissioner for commercial and common law, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our recommendations for reform and development of the law, therefore, seek to solidify the legal foundation for digital assets. We also aim to ensure that the private law in England and Wales remains a dynamic, globally competitive and flexible tool that enables further technological innovation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mike Freer, the U.K. justice minister, said the findings of the consultation process show the strength of English and Welsh law &#8220;in responding to the fast-paced changes caused by emerging technologies in the law sector.&#8221;</p>
<p>Among some of the recommendations is the commission&#8217;s call for the enactment of &#8220;legislation to confirm the existence of a distinct third category of personal property under the law.&#8221; The commission also recommended the creation of a panel of experts &#8220;to provide non-binding advice to courts on complex legal issues relating to digital assets.&#8221; The creation of a tailor-made framework for facilitating the &#8220;operation and enforcement of collateral arrangements relating to crypto-tokens and crypto-assets&#8221; is also described.</p>

Milei noted that his team had signed an NDA (non-disclosure agreement) with unknown third parties that would provide the liquidity needed to close the Central Bank of Argentina.</strong></p>
<h2>Javier Milei Develops Dollarization Proposal in Argentina</h2>
<p>Javier Milei, a liberal presidential candidate in Argentina, has advanced his government plan to eliminate inflation in the country if elected. He stated he already has the funds to dollarize the economy at current market prices.</p>
<p>Milei, who has made dollarization a pivotal part of his government plan, <a href="https://twitter.com/JMilei/status/1673814833328791554?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declared</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While they attack, defame, operate, etc., we have been advancing in negotiations and we have already obtained the dollars to dollarize the economy at the value of the market dollar. We continue working to solve a big problem in Argentina, which is inflation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Milei <a href="https://twitter.com/MJMendezCasarie/status/1674016062738759680" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> that he and his team had signed a confidentiality agreement with undisclosed third parties to provide the means necessary for the dollarization process. He estimated that the nation could collect <a href="https://twitter.com/ElPelucaMilei/status/1674199176433762305?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">double</a> the dollars needed to withdraw all the Argentine pesos from circulation, closing the Central Bank of Argentina.</p>
<p>Milei is also <a href="https://www.infobae.com/politica/2023/06/27/javier-milei-aseguro-que-ya-consiguio-los-fondos-para-dolarizar-al-valor-del-mercado/?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1687908059" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preparing</a> the law project that will be presented to the Argentine congress and estimating the time for the implementation of this initiative. Milei noted that his first proposal required at least two and a half years to be adopted, while new dollarization formats currently being designed demand less time to be put into practice.</p>

<h2>Numbers and Feasibility</h2>
<p>The dollarization idea, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/argentina-debates-dollarization-in-the-midst-of-rampant-devaluation-and-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presented</a> to the public in April as a way out of the inflationary and devaluation crisis, has faced criticism from all angles of the political spectrum. Some economists have spoken against it, stating that it would be impossible to cement during the current economic reality of the country.</p>
<p>However, Milei believes economists have greatly overestimated the numbers associated with this process. He <a href="https://twitter.com/JMilei/status/1674027904827523072" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detailed</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They said that [dollarization] was crazy impossible, $70 billion was needed. After, it was $50 billion. Someone close to them told them that although it was difficult, it was feasible. Now it&#8217;s about $35 billion. If they knew about finance a long time ago, they would have realized that it is possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, Milei&#8217;s position on polls has fallen, now <a href="https://www.cronista.com/economia-politica/como-saldra-milei-en-agosto-segun-las-ultimas-encuestas-con-los-candidatos-confirmados/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showing</a> him in the third position after Sergio Massa, the economy minister of Argentina and a key figure in the current economic establishment, announced he would join the presidential race.</p>

The stock has been viewed as a source of funds that can be used to compensate customers who suffered losses as a result of the coin trading platform’s collapse. </strong></p>
<h2>Cryptocurrency Exchange FTX Postpones Sale of Anthropic Shares</h2>
<p>Bankrupt crypto exchange FTX has decided to hold off the sale of its stake in the AI company Anthropic. The stock, worth $500 million, has been among the exchange’s most sought-after assets, Bloomberg noted in a report.</p>
<p>According to sources who chose to remain anonymous, bidders have been informed this month about the pause by Perella Weinberg Partners, the financial services firm acting as an advisor in FTX’s bankruptcy which was looking to sell the Anthropic shares.</p>
<p>The AI startup was established in 2021 by former employees of Openai, the developer of the chatbot <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/over-100000-compromised-chatgpt-accounts-discovered-on-darknet-markets/">Chatgpt</a>. In May of this year, Anthropic announced it had raised $450 million to support the development of its AI bot named ‘Claude.’</p>
<p>Anthropic has been recently valued at $4.6 billion and secondary market buyers have been seeking to acquire shares of the company. FTX’s stake in the AI firm is one of the biggest investments made by what was one the largest digital asset exchanges.</p>
<p>FTX <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/troubled-crypto-exchange-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection-ceo-steps-down/">filed</a> for bankruptcy protection amid liquidity issues in November 2022. The sale of the Anthropic stake was halted a day after FTX’s new CEO, John J Ray III, accused the former management of the crypto company of misappropriating assets, Forbes remarked in an article.</p>
<p>Some of the political donations and venture capital investments made by FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), its founder and former chief executive, have been partially funded by commingled customer deposits, according to a report published by the exchange’s new management this week.</p>
<p>FTX and SBF’s crypto trading firm Alameda Research made the $500 million investment in Anthropic, according to the internal documents seen by Bloomberg. At this point, it remains unclear how long the sale of the stake in the AI startup will be delayed.</p>

The news comes when the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange finds itself under pressure from regulators and banking partners in Europe and elsewhere.</strong></p>
<h2>Paysafe to Stop Euro Deposits and Withdrawals for Binance</h2>
<p>Crypto exchange Binance, the global leader in terms of daily trading volume, will lose access to payments in the common European currency, another setback for its operations on the Old Continent that comes amid regulatory crackdown in various jurisdictions.</p>
<p>“Following a strategic review, we have taken the decision to cease offering our embedded wallet solution to Binance across the region,” its U.K.-based payment processor, Paysafe, said in a statement, quoted by Bloomberg. The company added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Paysafe and Binance are now working to mutually implement an orderly and fair process to terminate this service over the next few months.</p></blockquote>
<p>Paysafe will no longer support bank transfers of euros to and from Binance via the Single Euro Payments Area (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Euro_Payments_Area" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEPA</a>) network, starting from Sept. 25, a spokesperson for the exchange confirmed. Binance “will be changing the provider,” the representative pointed out and emphasized:</p>
<blockquote><p>All methods of depositing and withdrawing other fiat currencies as well as buying and selling crypto on Binance.com remain unaffected.</p></blockquote>
<p>The development coincides with increased pressure on Binance in some EU member states. The exchange was recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-ordered-to-cease-all-crypto-services-in-belgium/">ordered</a> to cease all crypto services in Belgium while French prosecutors are <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/french-investigation-targets-binance-allegations-of-money-laundering-and-regulatory-violations/">investigating</a> it for money laundering violations.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Binance <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-pulls-out-of-netherlands-seeks-to-deregister-cyprus-unit/">pulled out</a> of the Dutch market, after failing to obtain registration as a crypto service provider in the Netherlands, applied for deregistration in Cyprus as such, and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-unit-in-britain-cancels-uk-regulatory-authorization/">cancelled</a> its U.K. authorization to focus on fewer regulated entities in Europe.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the platform’s share of euro-denominated crypto trading has dropped to 13% this year, according to data from research firm Kaiko. The market share of Binance’s subsidiary in the in the U.S., where the exchange is engaged in a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-cz-agree-to-repatriate-us-customer-assets-sec-secures-court-order/">legal battle</a> with the securities regulator, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-us-market-share-shrinks-amid-legal-battle-with-sec/">fell</a> to 1.5%.</p>
<p>In March, Paysafe announced it would stop supporting withdrawals and deposits for  in the United Kingdom and did so in May, which resulted in a subsequent drop of crypto trading volume denominated in the British pound across multiple platforms. At the time, the London-headquartered company said it would continue to support transfers for Binance in Europe and Latin America.</p>
