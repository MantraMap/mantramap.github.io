Kennedy Jr. says he does not want anti-crypto people on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). He also slammed the securities regulator for protecting banks rather than the American people. &#x201C;What they&#x2019;re doing is obscure, it&#x2019;s not transparent, and it&#x2019;s not bringing transparency to our system,&#x201D; said the presidential hopeful.</strong></p>
<h2>RFK Jr on SEC, Bitcoin, Crypto Regulation</h2>
<p>U.S. presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (RFK Jr.) expressed admiration for bitcoin while criticizing the regulatory approach of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) towards the cryptocurrency industry in an interview with Thestreet, published Friday. RFK Jr. is a nephew of former U.S. President John F. Kennedy and a son of former U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy.</p>
<p>Sharing his intention to nominate crypto-friendly individuals to the SEC should he be elected president, Kennedy stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don&#x2019;t want people on the SEC commission who are anti-crypto. At most, they should be neutral, and we should have people on there who are from the crypto community.</p></blockquote>
<p>Multiple people have <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/commissioner-sec-enforcement-centric-approach-crypto-regulation/">criticized</a> the SEC, under Chair Gary Gensler, for taking an <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-enforcement-remains-focused-on-crypto-chair-gensler-says-hes-impressed-with-enforcement-results/">enforcement-centric approach</a> to regulating the crypto space. In December last year, Gensler said the securities watchdog will use all available tools to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-will-use-all-available-tools-to-crack-down-on-crypto-firms-that-arent-in-compliance-with-its-rules-says-chair-gensler/">crack down</a> on uncompliant crypto firms. However, many have complained that the rules are so unclear that it is very difficult to ensure compliance. Last month, the Nasdaq-listed crypto exchange Coinbase filed <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-files-legal-action-against-sec-over-lack-of-regulatory-clarity/">legal action</a> against the SEC over a lack of regulatory clarity. In the same month, U.S. Congressman Warren Davidson (R-OH) revealed that he is introducing legislation to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-lawmaker-introducing-legislation-to-remove-sec-chairman-due-to-long-series-of-abuses/">remove</a> the chairman of the SEC &#x201C;to correct a long series of abuses.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Kennedy stressed: &#x201C;SEC&#x2019;s function now is not to protect the American people, but it&#x2019;s to protect the banks &#x2014; particularly the central banks and those interests.&#x201D; He added:</p>
<blockquote><p>What they&#x2019;re doing is obscure, it&#x2019;s not transparent, and it&#x2019;s not bringing transparency to our system.</p></blockquote>

<h2>RFK Jr Highlights Benefits of Bitcoin</h2>
<p>The presidential hopeful has been a strong supporter of bitcoin and his campaign <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kennedy-jr-to-accept-btc-for-campaign-contributions-says-bitcoin-is-an-exercise-in-democracy/">accepts</a> <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> donations. Kennedy explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the fundaments of Bitcoin is that you can trust it. And nobody can manipulate it. There&#x2019;s no human being that can manipulate it.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#x201C;What happens with Bitcoin is very, very democratic. It&#x2019;s all decided by all the miners in a democratic way and by algorithms that can&#x2019;t be manipulated,&#x201D; Kennedy continued. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s the perfect base currency, because there&#x2019;s a finite amount of it&#x2026; The Bitcoin that exists on the Earth is infinitely divisible, so it&#x2019;s kind of the perfect currency &#x2014; it has an intrinsic value and it gives people a way out.&#x201D;</p>

The platform now provides spot and custodial services to both retail and institutional customers in Hong Kong. Huobi’s update comes shortly after Huobi Global faced regulatory hurdles in Malaysia, where authorities prohibited the operation of its crypto trading platform without a proper permit.</strong></p>
<h2>Huobi HK Launches Spot Trading and Managed Services in Hong Kong</h2>
<p>Huobi Global’s Hong Kong trading arm Huobi HK has announced it is offering spot trading services and custodial solutions to retail and professional traders. Hong Kong’s new licensing regime was launched in May with help from Hong Kong&#8217;s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) CEO Julia Leung.</p>
<p>Leung <a href="https://www.sfc.hk/-/media/EN/files/COM/Speech/20230427_Synopsis---CEO-at-Bloomberg-APAC-Policy-Series-English.pdf?rev=a3215ec963ea46ff961e6bba256e22ae&amp;hash=6D349791CA7F73703F2C9E6EC669EDB9">said</a> at the end of April that the effort could make Hong Kong “more attractive [and] more competitive” for “international and Mainland capital.” Crypto trading platforms will be regulated by the regulator’s Fintech Task Force. The SFC is working with international regulators from other regions to “set baseline standards to regulate centralised virtual asset exchanges for adoption in major markets.”</p>
<p>Following the codification of the new licensing regime, Huobi HK announced it would be offering services to retail and institutional traders. “Huobi HK is now offering spot and managed services to professional and retail customers,” the firm <a href="https://twitter.com/HuobiGlobalzh/status/1663056188567883777?s=20">tweeted</a> on Monday. “As a pioneer of a virtual asset trading platform in Hong Kong, Huobi HK has officially submitted an application notice to the Hong Kong Securities Regulatory Commission on May 29, and we look forward to obtaining a virtual asset exchange license.”</p>

<p>The company added that Huobi HK will collaborate with independent auditors over the next six months to focus on the platform&#8217;s security, anti-money laundering, and compliance operations in order to meet the SFC’s and licensing regime’s requirements. Huobi HK’s entry into Hong Kong follows Huobi Global (the subsidiary’s parent company) getting <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/malaysian-regulator-orders-crypto-exchange-huobi-global-to-halt-operations-in-the-country/">reprimanded</a> by the Malaysian securities regulator. Malaysia’s authorities have told the exchange to stop soliciting Malaysian residents and to halt operations in the Southeast Asian country.</p>

The development follows the acquisition of application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) machines from the bankrupt company by the Fahrenheit coalition, of which USBTC is a member. USBTC said it aims to revive the fleet of 121,800 Celsius machines and foresees a 12.2 exahash per second (EH/s) boost to its mining operations.</strong></p>
<h2>US Bitcoin Corp Assumes Control of Restructured Celsius Mining Unit</h2>
<p>According to an announcement on May 25, 2023, <a href="https://usbitcoin.com">U.S. Bitcoin Corp</a> (USBTC) has plans to utilize the mining assets of the now-bankrupt crypto lender, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-lender-celsius-to-be-acquired-by-novawulf-exiting-chapter-11/">Celsius</a>. After multiple rounds of bidding for the restructured mining division of Celsius, USBTC submitted a winning bid for the Fahrenheit coalition. The Fahrenheit coalition is a group that consists of Ravi Kaza, Steven Kokinos, Proof Group Capital Management, Arrington Capital, and USBTC. Following the restructuring, Fahrenheit is set to assume the role of the management company for Celsius.</p>
<p>Fahrenheit is slated to receive an annual management fee of $20 million for its services under a five-year agreement. As part of the proposed restructuring, USBTC will enter into operating and services agreements with the restructured company, gaining exclusive control over all bitcoin mining rigs previously held by Celsius. USBTC will also receive an annual fee of $15 million, net of operating expenses, from Fahrenheit to supervise the mining division of the revamped entity.</p>
<p>“Our specialized expertise and track record of execution ultimately secured Fahrenheit’s successful bid to restructure Celsius,” Michael Ho, CEO of USBTC said in a statement. “Each member of the coalition brings extensive experience operating, optimizing, and scaling high-potential assets across Web3 markets.”</p>

<p>USBTC’s acquisition of the mining assets owned by Celsius follows the firm <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-bitcoin-corp-secures-hosting-agreements-150000-bitcoin-miners/">securing hosting agreements</a> with five different companies for 150,000 bitcoin miners. Teslawatt, Marathon Digital, Foundry USA, Sphere 3D, and Decimal Group are collaborating with USBTC to deploy the machines. The latest acquisition of Celsius’s 121,800 ASIC mining rigs will contribute 12,200 petahash per second (PH/s) — which is equivalent to 12.2 exahash per second (EH/s) — to USBTC&#8217;s mining capabilities.</p>

The regulatory body had accused the two crypto firms of offering unregistered securities.</strong></p>
<h2>Gemini and Genesis Refute SEC&#8217;s Claims of Unregistered Securities, File Motion to Dismiss</h2>
<p>In January 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Gemini and Genesis for allegedly offering unregistered securities to American customers. The SEC <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-charges-genesis-and-gemini-winklevoss-says-regulators-lawsuit-is-super-lame/">complaint</a> alleges that &#8220;through this unregistered offering, Genesis and Gemini raised billions of dollars’ worth of crypto assets from hundreds of thousands of investors.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.592343/gov.uscourts.nysd.592343.31.0.pdf">court document</a> filed on May 26, 2023, lawyers representing Gemini and Genesis insisted that the SEC’s &#8220;complaint must be dismissed&#8221; because the &#8220;Master Digital Asset Loan Agreement (MDALA)&#8221; linked to Gemini&#8217;s Earn program is &#8220;not a security.&#8221; The lawyers argue that the SEC is attempting to transform the Earn program into something it was never intended to be. The Gemini and Genesis dismissal motion states:</p>
<blockquote><p>While the SEC suggests that application of the federal securities laws is obvious here, the complaint is a novel attempt to expand their scope beyond any reasonable reading of the relevant statutory language.</p></blockquote>
<p>The SEC&#8217;s lawsuit against Gemini and Genesis is not the first time that securities regulators have taken action against interest-bearing crypto platforms. Prior to the bankruptcy filings of Celsius and Blockfi, securities officials from several states had filed complaints and cease-and-desist orders against them. Despite the SEC&#8217;s complaints against interest-bearing accounts, Gemini and Genesis maintain that the MDALA does not meet the definitions of a security.</p>

<p>“The reality is that the MDALA was never sold or offered for sale, could not be traded on any secondary market, did not involve the transfer of title to any asset, and did not require any lending or borrowing by anyone,” the dismissal motion adds. The two crypto companies claim that even if the SEC adequately alleged that the MDALA is a security, the regulator “failed to make non-conclusory allegations that the MDALA was sold to anyone, or that any party offered to sell it.”</p>

<h2>Litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>)</h2>
<p>Litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>) was a notable mover on Monday, as the token climbed for a sixth consecutive session.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>/USD raced to a peak of $92.16 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $89.10.</p>
<p>This move has led to litecoin climbing to a key resistance level of $93.00, which was last hit on May 23.</p>

<p>From the chart, the recent rise seems to be a result of the relative strength index (RSI) breaking out of a ceiling at 51.00.</p>
<p>The index has since rallied further, hitting a resistance point at 57.00, which has resulted in earlier gains fading.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a> is trading at $91.38, with price strength at a reading of 56.05.</p>

<h2><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a></h2>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a>, or binance coin, was also in the green to start the week, with prices moving to a multi-week high in the process.</p>
<p>Following a bottom at $307.53 on Sunday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a>/USD rose to an intraday peak of $316.83 earlier today.</p>
<p>This surge saw <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a> hit its highest level since May 9, when the token was trading above $320.00.</p>

<p>Overall, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a> is now trading 2% higher than at the same point last week, with today&#x2019;s rally sending the RSI to its strongest reading since May 1.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the 10-day (red) moving average (MA) is also moving towards an upwards crossover with the 25-day (blue) MA.</p>
<p>Should this cross take place, there is a good chance that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a> will move towards a long-term ceiling at the $340.00 mark.</p>

Asonacrip, a local cryptocurrency association, also reported that hundreds of petro wallets were eliminated or blocked.</strong></p>
<h2>Venezuelan Petro Blockchain Halted</h2>
<p>The blockchain of the petro, the official Venezuelan cryptocurrency, has allegedly been facing operational problems since last week. Asonacrip, a private association of crypto enthusiasts, issued a statement warning about the issue, stating that the Petro chain had stopped its block generation on May 24, affecting the functionality of the cryptocurrency asset.</p>
<p>In a joint statement with Cryptoland.vzla, a crypto education-focused group, Asonacrip <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptolandV/status/1662269824360128519?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last Wednesday (May 24) at 07:00 in the morning, suddenly and without warning, the Petro Blockchain was paralyzed, making transactions between different wallets impossible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, the Petro blockchain <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptolandV/status/1662526520110333953?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started</a> to produce blocks again on May 27, when it issued just four blocks before <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptolandV/status/1662834332761817090?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">halting</a> again on May 28.</p>

<h2>Hundreds of Wallets Blocked</h2>
<p>The joint statement also alerted about a massive block and elimination of petro wallets, which occurred when the chain was first halted. On this, the joint statement explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A few hours later, also without warning, accounts of already hundreds of users of the PATRIA platform were blocked and deleted, most of them belonging to active members of this community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mario Silva, a Venezuelan journalist and deputy of the Venezuelan Legislative Assembly, also <a href="https://twitter.com/hojillasilva/status/1661953409384083458?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alerted</a> about the issue via social networks about a possible exploit, stating that many users had their wallets blocked with no explanation.</p>
<p>Other reports <a href="https://twitter.com/PetroDivisa/status/1662648203970215936?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a> that withdrawals in fiat currency were also blocked since the intervention of Sunacrip, more than two months ago. At the time of writing, neither Sunacrip nor the petro official support account has given updates on the problems reported.</p>
<p>Sunacrip, the Venezuelan cryptocurrency watchdog, is under the temporary management of an intervention board after its head, Joselit Ramirez, was arrested for alleged participation in a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/how-crypto-ended-up-at-the-center-of-a-potential-20-billion-internal-corruption-scandal-in-venezuela-bitcoin-mining-shutdown-results/">multi-billion dollar</a> crypto corruption scheme.</p>
<p>Also, as a result of this ongoing investigation, Bitcoin miners that had legally registered their companies with the institution have been required to halt operations until further notice since March 24. This has caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses for the sector.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) rose above the $28,000 to start the week, as crypto markets reacted to an apparent agreement to increase the U.S. debt ceiling.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Following a low of $27,125.53 on Sunday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD raced to a peak of $28,432.04 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As a result of today&#x2019;s rally, bitcoin moved to its highest point since May 8, when price reached a high of $28,676.&#13;</p>

Overall, it appears that the latest move took place once the relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a ceiling at 53.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Price strength has since climbed, and the index is currently tracking at 54.92, with the next point of resistance at 57.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Should this momentum continue to increase, there is a good chance that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> will move above the $29,000 mark.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
In addition to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) also moved higher on Monday, climbing above the $1,900 level.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD jumped to an intraday high of $1,926.42 earlier in the day, following a low of $1,839.13 the day prior.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
This surge led to the world&#x2019;s second largest cryptocurrency hitting a three-week high in the process.&#13;</p>

Looking at the chart, today&#x2019;s surge came as the 10-day (red) moving average crossed over its 25-day (blue) counterpart.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
If this trend continues, there is a strong chance that ethereum could move closer to $2,000 in the upcoming week.&#13;<br />

In this issue, Venezuela tries to regain control of the gold stash held in London again; Argentina seeks to expand the Chinese yuan swap line; and Azteco enables bitcoin purchases in more than 55,000 stores in Colombia and Costa Rica.</strong></p>
<h2>Venezuela Appeals to Regain Control of Gold Held in England</h2>
<p>The Venezuelan government has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/venezuela-seeks-to-regain-control-of-more-than-1-8-billion-in-gold-after-interim-government-dissolves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced</a> a new appeal to try and regain control of the Venezuelan gold held in the vaults of the Bank of England.</p>
<p>According to the appeal presented before the London Court of Appeals by the party representing the Central Bank of Venezuela board controlled by President Nicolas Maduro, the disbandment of the interim government of Juan Guaido on January 2022 changes the case&#8217;s background.</p>
<p>The board named by the Venezuelan assembly, elected back in 2015 to protect the country&#8217;s foreign assets, has no official recognition from the U.K. government, which accepted the dissolution of Venezuela&#8217;s interim government in January. Richard Lissack, appointed by Maduro to handle the appeal, believes this should allow the court to acknowledge the decisions that dissolved the &#8220;ad hoc&#8221; board of the Central Bank of Venezuela, appointed by the interim government.</p>
<h2>Argentina Seeks Extension of Chinese Swap Line</h2>
<p>The government of Argentina will <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/argentina-to-expand-de-dollarization-efforts-seeks-extension-of-yuan-based-swap-line-with-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seek</a> an extension of the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/argentina-to-settle-chinese-imports-in-yuan-to-safeguard-dwindling-dollar-reserves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available</a> amount of a swap line established by the Chinese government to continue financing its imports. According to local sources, Economy Minister Sergio Massa and Central Bank of Argentina President Miguel Pesce will travel to China to double the access to the Chinese yuan-based swap line from $5 billion to $10 billion.</p>
<p>The extension would help Argentina maintain foreign reserves held in U.S. dollars, which have touched their lowest level in the last seven years, while the government continues negotiating upcoming disbursements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>

<h2>Azteco Enables Bitcoin Purchases in 55,000 Latam Stores</h2>
<p>Azteco, a Bitcoin startup, announced the sale of bitcoin vouchers in <a href="https://twitter.com/Azteco_/status/1661735756052987905?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colombia</a> and<a href="https://twitter.com/Azteco_/status/1661383369198895106?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Costa Rica</a>. Through social networks, the company announced these vouchers would be available in 52,000 stores in Colombia, and 3,000 in Costa Rica. The vouchers can be purchased with cash or bank transfer.</p>
<p>Azteco had previously <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-voucher-provider-azteco-secures-6-million-funding-round-led-by-jack-dorsey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised</a> $6 million in a funding round led by former Twitter and Block CEO Jack Dorsey. Azteco co-founder Paul Ferguson declares these funds will allow the company to increase its market activation and reach customers more effectively.</p>
