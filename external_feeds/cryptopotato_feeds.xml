			            <description><![CDATA[Market strategy and research firm Fundstrat made a bold Bitcoin price prediction a few hours before the asset tanked to a two-month low.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Speaking to CNBC on Aug. 16, Fundstrat analyst Tom Lee said that if the spot BTC ETF gets approved, the demand for Bitcoin will be greater than the supply.</p>
<p>He added that the firm’s crypto strategists predicted a clearing price of $150,000 to $180,000.</p>
<p>The bold prediction is before the end of next year and only if a spot ETF is approved in the United States, he reiterated.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">“If the Spot <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">#Bitcoin</a> ETF gets approved … the clearing price of <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">$BTC</a> is above $150,000.” – Tom Lee <a href="https://twitter.com/fundstrat?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@fundstrat</a> <a href="https://t.co/ILQZqdjsZA" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/ILQZqdjsZA</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>No Six Figures Without ETF</h2>
<p>When asked what would happen if the ETF applications are rejected, Lee said the halving will still create demand and price gains, “but it won’t be six figures.”</p>
<p>It should be noted that Tom Lee is an uber-Bitcoin bull who has made bold predictions in the past. In late December 2020, Lee <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/better-than-this-year-bitcoin-price-to-hit-120000-in-2021-tom-lee-predicts/" data-wpel-link="internal">predicted</a> BTC would reach $120,000 the following year.</p>
<p>In August 2021, he <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-could-reach-100000-by-the-end-of-2021-fundstrats-tom-lee/" data-wpel-link="internal">said</a> that BTC prices would reach $100,000 by the end of the year. In reality, it peaked at $69,000 in November and declined into a multi-year bear market after that.</p>
<p>In February 2022, the Fundstrat Managing Partner <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/fundstrats-tom-lee-explains-how-bitcoin-could-hit-200000/" data-wpel-link="internal">predicted</a> that the Bitcoin price could surge to $200,000. However, by the end of 2022, BTC had slumped to a bear market cycle low of $16,000.</p>
<p>Now just a few hours after he offered a $150,000 BTC price forecast, the asset has slumped to a two-month low.</p>
<p>BTC has fallen 2% on the day to an intraday and two-month low of $28,430 during the Thursday morning Asian trading session.</p>
<p>The move followed the release of the minutes of a Federal Reserve meeting in which it said it did not expect a recession though officials still saw the need for higher rates.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Bears Lurking</h2>
<p>Despite the fact that Bitcoin is still <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-investors-reach-all-time-low-in-on-chain-spending-glassnode/" data-wpel-link="internal">trading sideways</a> on longer-term charts, the bearish sentiment is seeping in.</p>
<p>Analysts were saying that BTC looks very weak and a “savage breakdown” could be imminent.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">looking like <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/btc?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">#btc</a> is about to lose this channel we formed over the last 2 weeks, all bounces from the highs have been super shallow with none even reaching any 0.618 fib levels.</p>
<p>btc looking super weak to me with alts looking even worse and i cant help but feel a savage breakdown… <a href="https://t.co/WYPwgQGSGU" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/WYPwgQGSGU</a></p>
<p>— Bluntz (@Bluntz_Capital) <a href="https://twitter.com/Bluntz_Capital/status/1691938883179823311?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">August 16, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Willy Woo <a href="https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1691854547273282010" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">said</a> it was “crunch time for BTC,” adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Macro headwinds from US dollar strength. Meanwhile there’s increasing demand on futures market (pro traders) and on-chain fundamentals picking up. Either way, up or down, we are now setting up for a strong move. Volatility squeeze incoming.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The dip is the largest since July 24 but is pretty minor when zooming out to view the multi-month view.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PRESS RELEASE &#8211; Geneva, Switzerland, August 16th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://trondao.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><strong>TRON DAO</strong></a><strong> (“TRON”)</strong> is pleased to announce that it has joined the <a href="https://cryptocurrency-association.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><strong>Japan Cryptoasset Business Association</strong></a><strong> (“JCBA”)</strong> as an associate member starting from August 1st, 2023. As a leading global blockchain, TRON is committed to building cooperation and collaboration with other JCBA members to promote the growth of the crypto industry in Japan and all across Asia.</p>
<p>Established in 2016, JCBA is a Japanese-based association for stakeholders within the Web3 ecosystem. It aims to foster a promising environment for the development of digital assets, including cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and stablecoins. Currently, JCBA has 134 members from both Web3 and traditional industries based in Japan and internationally.</p>
<p>By joining as an associate member of JCBA, TRON strives to closely collaborate with the Japanese market and contribute to JCBA&#8217;s vision by leveraging TRON&#8217;s efficient network and robust userbase.</p>
<h2>About TRON DAO</h2>
<p>TRON DAO is a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps.</p>
<p>Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of August 2023, it has over 179.07 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 6.26 billion total transactions, and over $13.01 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN.</p>
<p>In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government’s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (“DMC”), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica’s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens &#8211; TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.</p>
<h2>About JCBA</h2>
<p>The Japan Cryptoasset Business Association (JCBA) was established in 2016 as a membership organization for stakeholders in the public blockchain and Web3.0 ecosystems who conduct business related to crypto assets, NFTs, stablecoins, and other digital assets in Japan, with the goal of improving the environment.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[A month after going live, OPNX created by founders of the collapsed 3AC, was slammed with a $2.7 million fine by Dubai's VARA.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Dubai&#8217;s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) fined OPNX — the cryptocurrency project created by founders of the defunct digital asset hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) — along with the project&#8217;s founders and CEO, shortly after issuing a reprimand in May.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While the executives have paid their fine, VARA said OPNX is yet to make payment, with the regulator considering taking actions against the platform.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">VARA Fined OPNX, CEO, and Founders $2.7M</h2>
<p dir="ltr">In an <a href="https://www.vara.ae/en/regulations/regulatory-notices/vara-notice-of-fines-opnx-exchange/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">enforcement notice</a> published on Wednesday (Aug. 16, 2023), VARA revealed that OPNX was yet to pay a fine of 10 million AED ($2.72 million) issued against it on May 2 for a market offense.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The regulator also issued a penalty fine of 200,000 AED ($54,450) to OPNX CEO Leslie Lamb, 3AC founders Su Zhu and Kylie Davies, and OPNX co-founder Mark Lamb on the same day for violating marketing, advertising, and promotions regulations. According to VARA, all four individuals have fully paid their fines.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The launch of OPNX in April 2023 was met with criticisms from the crypto community, majorly because the platform was created by Zhu and Davies, who were behind a previous cryptocurrency project that collapsed and left investors with huge losses. Currently, OPNX&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/OPNX_Official/status/1691607311167455338?t=vHYICC9bt8bclcBfL1TTSg&amp;s=19" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">average daily volume</a> is $102 million, with a 24-hour trade volume of over $165.8 million and a seven-day trade volume of $715 million.</p>
<p dir="ltr">OPNX later went ahead to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/3ac-founders-launch-brand-new-vc-fund-tied-to-opnx/" data-wpel-link="internal">announce</a> a new ecosystem partner, a venture capital fund called 3AC Ventures (separate from the defunct hedge fund 3AC), with Davies <a href="https://twitter.com/KyleLDavies/status/1671505640848515072?t=71lRoJ0JDbDTiXSTXa4oAg&amp;s=19" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">stating</a>, &#8220;3AC is dead, long live 3AC Ventures.&#8221; The VC fund, which, unsurprisingly, was not well received by community members, offers &#8220;superior risk-adjusted returns without leverage,&#8221; according to its website.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Dubai Taking Tough Stance Against OPNX</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Before the fines, VARA <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/dubai-regulator-reprimands-opnx-founders-for-conducting-unregulated-activity/" data-wpel-link="internal">reprimanded</a> Zhu, Davies, Mark Lamb, Leslie Lamb, and Sudhu Arumugan for carrying out unregulated activities in Dubai and for also promoting and marketing OPNX to residents without regulatory approval.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, the regulator is looking to take further actions against OPNX for its failure to pay its fine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Vara shall determine consequential actions warranted against OPNX, which may include further fines, penalties, and/or taking any actions necessary to recover payment and definitively remedy the behavior including, but not limited to, referring the matter to any law enforcement agency(ies) or competent courts.&#8221;</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[SDF's commercial partnership with MoneyGram officially began in 2021.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) &#8211; the organization behind the Stellar network that facilitates cross-border transactions &#8211; announced becoming a minority investor in payments giant MoneyGram International.</p>
<p>The latest investment is the first of its kind made from SDF&#8217;s treasury which includes a position on MGI&#8217;s Board of Directors. Denelle Dixon, SDF CEO and Executive Director, will occupy that role, according to the official announcement.</p>
<h2>Stellar x MoneyGram</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://stellar.org/blog/sdfs-investment-in-moneygram-international" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">investment</a> was sourced from SDF&#8217;s internal cash reserve, Dixon said in a statement. This cash reserve is designated to support the operations of the non-profit organization rather than the Enterprize Fund, which targets investments in startups and emerging businesses.</p>
<p>The exec mentioned that the investment is expected to position SDF as a crucial player aiding MoneyGram in expanding its digital business, exploring blockchain technology, and contributing to the many other ways the fintech company allows consumers and businesses to transfer and manage money in nearly every country across the globe.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This is an exciting time for SDF and MGI, and I believe the opportunities will only grow. Continuing to build strong partnerships with organizations across the payments space puts SDF one step closer to achieving our mission of creating equitable access to financial services.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>MoneyGram and SDF&#8217;s <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/stellar-lumens-xlm-spikes-12-after-news-of-a-partnership-between-moneygram-and-the-stellar-foundation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">partnership</a> dates back to October 2021, when the two joined forces to settle transactions with USDC stablecoin for instant and cheaper transactions.</p>
<h2>Bidding Ripple Adieu</h2>
<p>The payments firm previously partnered with Stellar&#8217;s direct competitor to leverage the RippleNet as part of the exchange settlements process for international remittances. MoneyGram also received financial incentives in the form of XRP in exchange for giving Ripple an equity stake in the company.</p>
<p>MoneyGram, however, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-and-moneygram-part-ways-amid-sec-litigation-while-xrp-eyes-0-50/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">severed its ties</a> with Ripple in March 2021, a few months after the SEC slapped the blockchain firm with a lawsuit over XRP. At that time, Ripple maintained that the decision to part ways was mutual and hinted at a potential rekindling once the legal spat was over.</p>
<p>While Ripple secured a partial victory against the SEC this year, MoneyGram has not yet revisited the idea of reinstating the partnership. With SDF, on the other hand, the payment company <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/moneygram-to-partner-with-stellar-to-provide-stablecoin-remittances/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">announced</a> plans to offer stablecoin remittances last year.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The Shibarium mainnet is now live and ready for users and developers alike.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, Shiba Inu (SHIB) developers appeared on stage at the Blockchain Futurist Conference in Toronto to discuss the “End Game” for Shibarium – the meme token’s metaverse and NFT-oriented layer 2 blockchain.</p>
<p>The team said that the Shibarium mainnet has gone live, allowing developers to begin building apps on the blockchain.</p>
<ul>
<li>The ecosystem will include “Shibdentities,” a proof of personhood solution that lets users retain control of their data and privacy.</li>
<li>Shibdentities can be used to create digital wills, which transfer assets to another user’s wallet after one person’s death is confirmed.</li>
<li>“We are building a decentralized, autonomous, digital nation state,” said the team during its keynote presentation.</li>
<li>Regarding the Shibarium metaverse, the ecosystem will feature “seamless transactions” and its “Shiboshi” NFTs.</li>
<li>Shibarium will also use an “super app” called the ShibaHub – a common location for accessing a users’ favorite dapps.</li>
<li>Like many layer 2 solutions, “Shibarium” aims to address the scaling issues and transaction costs that plague Ethereum’s base layer.</li>
<li>Until now, details about Shibarium’s technical development have been largely a mystery.</li>
<li>However, lead developer Shytoshi Kusama has provided many hints about what features it will include, such as <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/shiba-inu-pumps-after-lead-developer-shares-shibarium-update-details/" data-wpel-link="internal">real-world asset authentication</a>.</li>
<li>SHIB is currently the 13th largest crypto by market cap.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[Disparte called for relevant federal legislation around stablecoins to protect consumers and prevent investors from companies with fake USD.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dante Disparte, the chief strategy officer and head of global policy of the second-largest stablecoin issuer Circle, has blasted crypto firms that create counterfeits of the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>According to a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-15/circle-criticizes-crypto-firms-that-counterfeit-us-dollars" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">report</a>, Disparte called for relevant federal legislation around stablecoins to protect consumers and prevent investors from companies with fake USD.</p>
<h2>Circle CSO Criticizes Firms That Counterfeit USD</h2>
<p>Disparte said the several bank failures in the U.S. earlier this year drove investors into unsafe and opaque crypto assets overseas, showing the need for sound monetary policy in the United States. He questioned the ability of any company to forge the USD using cryptographic methods, insisting that setting relevant rules would maintain transparency and ensure investor safety.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Candidly, should anyone anywhere be able to counterfeit U.S. dollar using cryptographic methods, or should there be a rule-set around competing with digital dollars on the internet where the safety and soundness and monetary policy of the United States is respected?” &#8211; he asked.</p></blockquote>
<p>Disparte’s remarks come as Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) sees a slump in its market dominance. The stablecoin, once favored by institutions, was negatively affected by its exposure to the now-bankrupt Silicon Valley Bank and worldwide regulatory scrutiny on crypto assets.</p>
<p>USDC’s supply has declined by more than 50% since June 2022, from $56 billion to around $26 billion. This has also affected its market share, which has dwindled significantly within the same period, while Tether – the largest stablecoin by market cap – continues to gain dominance.</p>
<h2>Circle Faces International Markets</h2>
<p>While USDC’s numbers are declining, Circle has disclosed its intention to face international crypto markets with Asia as the focus. In June, the company’s co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/circle-pays-close-attention-to-hong-kongs-crypto-policies-ceo-allaire-says/" data-wpel-link="internal">said</a> Circle is closely observing the regulatory developments in Hong Kong as the city aims to establish itself as a significant center for digital markets and stablecoins.</p>
<p>Most recently, Allaire <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/circles-jeremy-allaire-estimates-majority-of-usdc-adoption-originates-beyond-us-borders/" data-wpel-link="internal">estimated</a> that 70% of USDC adoption originates from non-U.S. regions, with Asia, Latin America, and Africa leading the pace. However, he <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/the-us-will-become-a-highly-competitive-market-once-it-embraces-crypto-circle-ceo-says/" data-wpel-link="internal">believes</a> the U.S. will become a highly competitive market once its regulators embrace the crypto industry.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Circle and Tether are facing competition from newly issued stablecoins like that of digital payments giant <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/paypal-launches-usd-stablecoin-for-payments-and-transfers/" data-wpel-link="internal">PayPal Holdings</a>.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The former President’s reported crypto holdings have shot up to nearly $3 million.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Updated filings show that former President Donald Trump owns $2.8 million worth of cryptocurrency in his Ethereum wallet – a far higher amount than disclosures from earlier this month appeared to suggest.</p>
<p>The disclosures paint a different picture of Trump’s views on crypto than his public pronouncements about the asset class would seem to suggest.</p>
<h2>Trumps Crypto and NFT Earnings</h2>
<p>As <a href="https://www.citizensforethics.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Disclosure-Report-Part-38-14-23.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">submitted</a> to the Office of Government Ethics, entry 24 under Trump’s “Employment Assets and Income and Retirement Accounts” lists a series of items related to crypto and NFTs.</p>
<p>The item is titled “CIC Digital LLC (License fees for NFTs)” and is subdivided into three parts: One of those parts included his Ethereum crypto wallet, which contained $2,806,341 in assets at disclosure time.</p>
<p>Another part – listed as “License agreement with NFT INT, LLC” – related to Trump’s earnings from a non-fungible token (NFT) collection he <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/donald-trump-reportedly-earned-up-to-1-million-from-his-latest-nft-collection/" data-wpel-link="internal">launched</a> as part of his relaunched election campaign to return to the White House in 2024. This amount totaled $4,866,832.</p>
<p>The first installment of the collection performed well, even surging after Trump’s first indictment in early April. However, it crashed later that month when he announced the launch of a <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/new-donald-trump-nfts-to-hit-the-market-again-but-heres-the-catch/" data-wpel-link="internal">second batch</a> of NFTs on Polygon.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Trump’s OGE financial disclosure documents <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/donald-trump-holds-between-250k-and-500k-worth-of-eth/" data-wpel-link="internal">stated</a> that he owned between $250,000 and $500,000 in his ETH wallet. This wallet was also connected to his NFT collection.</p>
<p>Trump’s wife Melania has also dabbled in NFT sales, launching an <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/melania-trump-launches-an-nft-and-blockchain-venture-based-on-solana/" data-wpel-link="internal">NFT venture</a> on Solana in 2021 featuring digital and physical art. Part of the proceeds were used to raise money for children aging out of the foster care system.</p>
<p>Melania also announced a set of 10,000 official NFTs celebrating Trump on President’s Day last year, meant to highlight “iconic” moments of the Trump administration.</p>
<h2>Trump’s Past Claims About Crypto</h2>
<p>In July 2021, Trump told Fox Business that he thought Bitcoin looks like a “scam” and <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/former-us-president-donald-trump-bitcoin-looks-like-a-scam/" data-wpel-link="internal">criticized</a> it for competing with the US dollar.</p>
<p>“I want the dollar to be the currency of the world. That’s what I’ve always said,&#8221; he said at the time.</p>
<p>That being the case, Trump was more recently <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/after-bail-release-trump-predicts-the-us-dollar-will-lose-global-dominance/" data-wpel-link="internal">bearish</a> on the U.S. dollar’s status under the Biden administration, warning that its devaluation would lead to its loss of world reserve status.</p>
<p>Unlike Trump, the current Republican party is largely <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/republicans-blast-white-house-for-failure-to-compromise-on-stablecoin-bill/" data-wpel-link="internal">supportive</a> of crypto, with several members of the party pushing for legislation to create a welcoming regulatory framework for the industry.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The team has eliminated the loophole, according to the latest update. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The second-largest decentralized exchange on the newly released Base blockchain &#8211; RocketSwap &#8211; announced eliminating any existing high risks and vulnerabilities a day after sustaining a &#8220;brute force hack of the server&#8221; where the platform stored its private keys.</p>
<p>The RocketSwap team confirmed relinquishing minting rights, which is part of its recovery plan. In a new update, the protocol said it has retained only low-risk rights to allocate new pools. The locked initial liquidity and 80k tokens, on the other hand, have been extended for 1 year.</p>
<ul>
<li>On August 14th, hackers stole $865,000 or 471 Ether from RocketSwap and bridged it from Base to Ethereum, which was <a href="https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1691268504396374016" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">flagged</a> by blockchain security expert, PeckShield.</li>
<li>The entity behind the attack then generated 90 trillion tokens named &#8220;LoveRCKT&#8221; and proceeded to move them to Uniswap, along with 400 ETH.</li>
<li>The platform&#8217;s official <a href="https://twitter.com/RocketSwap_Labs/status/1691398314795929601" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">statement</a> on the attack read,</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A brute force hack of the server was detected. Due to the proxy contract linked to our farm contract, multiple high-risk permissions became vulnerable. This resulted in the unauthorized transfer of the farm’s assets. Immediate steps were taken to shut down the farm and halt further potential risks.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The breach prompted RocketSwap to redeploy a new farm contract by dropping the proxy contract and open-sourcing it on-chain. As part of the emergency program, the DEX announced a new farm in a bid to advance the production reduction plan by 0.075 per block.</li>
<li>Among other things, RocketSwap also revealed its intention to call on the hackers to return the assets.</li>
<li>This was the second project on Coinbase-incubated layer 2 solutions, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbases-base-notches-4th-rank-in-daily-tps-among-layer-2-solutions-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Base,</a> to have suffered an attack.</li>
<li>Earlier this month, another DEX on Base called LeetSwap was drained off 342.5 ETH.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[PayPal needs time to come into compliance with new standards established by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>PayPal announced that it will temporarily suspend crypto purchases on its platform for its U.K. based users beginning in October.</p>
<p>The move comes in response to evolving regulatory guidelines provided by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) – Britain’s chief market regulator.</p>
<h2>PayPal Pauses Crypto Buys</h2>
<p>Per an <a href="https://twitter.com/Crypto_Crib_/status/1691661748359614481" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">email</a> received by certain U.K. users on Wednesday, the suspension will take effect on October 1, and is expected to last until early 2024.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Your crypto remains safe,” clarified the company. “You can keep it on our platform at no charge. You can also sell your crypto at any time.”</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">PayPal will &#39;pause&#39; crypto purchases in UK <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f1ec-1f1e7.png" alt="🇬🇧" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/NPkj7F61cC" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/NPkj7F61cC</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Crypto Crib (@Crypto_Crib_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Crypto_Crib_/status/1691661748359614481?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">August 16, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>PayPal <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/paypals-u-k-customers-can-now-buy-sell-and-hold-bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">enabled</a> crypto services for U.K. customers in September 2021, allowing them to buy, sell, and hold crypto. This followed its initial launch in the United States as early as October 2020.</p>
<p>To this day, supported assets are limited to Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Litecoin (LTC). In Q1, the company <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/paypal-holds-1-billion-in-crypto-on-balance-sheet-records-show/" data-wpel-link="internal">held</a> over $1 billion worth of these assets on its balance sheet o behalf of customers.</p>
<p>Though its crypto business model may seem simple, the FCA now requires crypto firms to “implement additional steps before customers can purchase crypto.” PayPal said it works closely with regulators to ensure that it stays compliant wherever it operates.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We apologize for the inconvenience,” said the company. “We will let you know when we have implemented the required changes to the crypto experience.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Compared to the United States, crypto companies have praised U.K. regulators and policymakers for embracing crypto, and helping provide a clear pathway to industry compliance.</p>
<p>In late June, the nation passed a bill <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/uk-passes-bill-establishing-crypto-and-stablecoins-as-regulated-financial-activities/" data-wpel-link="internal">establishing</a> crypto and stablecoin businesses as within the regulatory perimeter, while giving the FCA authority to create a clear regulatory framework for the sector.</p>
<p>Last month, the FCA published <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/guidance-consultation/gc23-2.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">guidelines</a> claiming that crypto memes could potentially amount to criminal offenses if they did not comply with existing financial promotion laws.</p>
<h2>PayPal’s Stablecoin Startup</h2>
<p>PayPal’s latest foray into the crypto industry is an attempt to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/paypal-launches-usd-stablecoin-for-payments-and-transfers/" data-wpel-link="internal">launch</a> its own stablecoin, which will be pegged to the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>Announced last week, PYUSD will be based on Ethereum and will be backed by cash, U.S. T-bills, and other cash equivalents. While currently only usable in crypto and Web 3-related activities, PayPal plans to popularize it for lost-cost transfers between users and merchants worldwide.</p>
<p>Shortly after the announcement, PayPal CEO Dan Schulman <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/a-week-following-stablecoin-introduction-paypal-appoints-new-ceo/" data-wpel-link="internal">said</a> that he will step down from his position in late September.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The SEC is seeking to appeal the Ripple ruling, while applications for a Bitcoin ETF are piling up. It seems the CFTC is doing the actual securities enforcement.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is leaving securities enforcement up to the CFTC when it comes to cryptocurrency. While the commission rushes ahead of Congress to write the entire federal crypto policy by lawsuit, the CFTC is going for more clear-cut violations.</p>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission took the lead late last week and filed charges of securities fraud against a cryptocurrency business in Florida. It <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8766-23" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">filed the</a> charges in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida.</p>
<h2>CFTC Charges Florida Residents for Crypto Scam</h2>
<p>The CFTC <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/4-people-charged-for-allgedly-defrauding-investors-in-crypto-and-precious-metal-scam/" data-wpel-link="internal">charged</a> four individuals in three states and their unregistered entity &#8220;Fundsz&#8221; with allegations of securities fraud Friday:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The complaint charges them with fraudulent solicitation from clients to purportedly trade in cryptocurrencies and precious metals.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The commission&#8217;s Director of Enforcement, Ian McGinley, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The CFTC continues to root out individuals who defraud customers in the cryptocurrency and precious metals markets.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>But the allegations faced by defendants in this case are actually within the purview of the SEC, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-xrp-cto-david-schwartz-breaks-down-howey-test-following-sec-appeal/" data-wpel-link="internal">according</a> to the Howey test in the recent Ripple court case.</p>
<h2>Commodity Futures Doing SEC&#8217;s Job</h2>
<p>This case is kind of like what <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/a-closer-look-at-what-sam-bankman-fried-is-accused-of-exactly/" data-wpel-link="internal">FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried</a> is in trouble for with the law. It&#8217;s not that they the defendants were selling Fugazi and claiming it&#8217;s Rolex. It&#8217;s that they were selling Rolex and claiming it&#8217;s a really great Fugazi.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not so great when people lose their money to something they thought was less risky during a 75% Bitcoin price plunge.</p>
<p>These are clear cut allegations of selling unregistered and unregulated securities. It&#8217;s the sort of thing the SEC could actually be effective at enforcing.</p>
<p>McGinley warns crypto investors seeking online brokerages and crypto exchanges:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Though the products fraudsters purport to trade and their methods of attracting victims—in this case through social media—may have changed, the old adage ‘if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is’ remains as valid as ever.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>That advice is just as good for considering a rare <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-to-judge-crypto-is-baseball-cards-not-stocks/" data-wpel-link="internal">baseball card purchase</a> as a high flying stock buy.</p>
