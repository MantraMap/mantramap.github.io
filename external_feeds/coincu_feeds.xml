<p>In addition, the platform has upgraded the BRC-20 tab in the user&#8217;s items page, making it easier to distinguish balances, view recent activities, and write new transfers to the list of BRC-20 users holding.</p>

<p>The Magic Eden (ME) cross-chain NFT platform has embraced the growing popularity of Bitcoin Ordinals by<a href="https://help.magiceden.io/en/articles/8050324-exploring-brc-20-tokens-fungible-tokenization-on-the-bitcoin-blockchain" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> adding </a>the BRC-20 standard to its open-source secondary platform and creator&#8217;s launch pad.</p>



<p>Users can now receive BRC-20 projects from ME, and creators can launch their BRC-20 drops for users to mint directly on the platform. This exciting move comes just two months after Magic Eden launched the Launchpad for Bitcoin Ordinals, quickly becoming the preferred marketplace for creators in the field.</p>

<p>As part of the company&#8217;s commitment to creators, those launching the BRC-20 Drops on ME&#8217;s launch pad will receive go-to-market strategy, marketing support, enhanced user interface, and everything in between. Other things needed to make their BRC projects successful.</p>



<p>In March 2023, an anonymous developer with the alias &#8220;Domo&#8221; proposed an experimental BRC-20 standard, allowing fungible tokens on Bitcoin. This breakthrough has allowed users to generate and mint tokens as an Order on the Bitcoin network, using the underlying JSON code as the token&#8217;s inscription.</p>



<p>Although ERC-20 inspires BRC-20, it does not use any smart contracts. Instead, it allows users to generate tokens directly by adding a JSON text file to the network. This opens up new possibilities for the Bitcoin blockchain, which has historically been connected as a medium of exchange and store of value.</p>

<p><a href="https://layerzero.network/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://layerzero.network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LayerZero</a> Token, a cryptocurrency project that had been gaining traction and interest from investors, is now under scrutiny due to this false claim. The community is concerned about the potential repercussions of such misinformation, as it undermines trust and confidence in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p>

<p>Upon closer investigation, it has been discovered that several reputable platforms, including Arkham, Nansen, and Etherscan, have mistakenly marked the nonexistent LayerZero Token as legitimate. This has further compounded the confusion surrounding the project. The labeling of non-existent tokens on these platforms raises concerns about the accuracy and reliability of their token information.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="690" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/LayerZero-1.png" alt="LayerZero 1" class="wp-image-202295" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/LayerZero-1.png 1000w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/LayerZero-1-300x207.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/LayerZero-1-768x530.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/LayerZero-1-750x518.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" title="LayerZero Token Not Deployed, Raises Concerns of Fake Token 6"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The community is particularly alarmed by the mention of &#8220;greater contract risk&#8221; in relation to LayerZero Token. This implies that the token&#8217;s owner would have the ability to issue additional tokens and manipulate the token balance, further fueling doubts about the project&#8217;s legitimacy. It is important to note that these claims are based on the false assumption that LayerZero Token has been deployed, which is not the case.</p>



<p>As a result of this misleading information, it is crucial for investors and the wider cryptocurrency community to exercise caution and conduct thorough research before engaging with any token projects. Verifying information from reliable sources, such as official project announcements or recognized industry experts, is essential to avoid falling victim to potential scams or fake tokens.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">

<p>The incident involving the misinformation surrounding LayerZero Token underscores the need for increased vigilance within the crypto community. It serves as a reminder that due diligence and skepticism are crucial when evaluating new projects and investment opportunities.</p>



<p>The true status of LayerZero Token remains unclear, and the community eagerly awaits an official statement from the project team regarding the deployment and authenticity of the token. Until then, it is advisable to remain cautious and rely on accurate information from verified sources.</p>

<p>The decision, while difficult, was made in order to ensure lean and efficient Dapper Labs, aligning with the company&#8217;s long-term goals and commitment to innovation.</p>

<p>Dapper Labs<a href="https://coincu.com/169624-dapper-labs-new-round-of-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> laid off</a> 20% of its full-time staff in February. Gharegozlou at that time described the layoffs as part of a restructuring.</p>



<p>Coincu <a href="https://coincu.com/139184-dapper-labs-cuts-22-of-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> in November that it has let off 22% of its workforce as part of a larger strategic refocus and team restructure. Several staff had already been shown the door months before the official layoff announcement, and the company&#8217;s mood had grown fraught with worry as a wave of top executives left.</p>

<p>ParaSpace is a Lending Protocol platform allowing users to borrow and lend against NFTs and tokens. NFT prices are provided by NFT Price Oracle and are based on the floor price of the NFT collection from OpenSea and LarvaLabs (for CryptoPunks).</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-789.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="561" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-789-1024x561.png" alt="NFT Lending Protocol ParaSpace Announces Upcoming Critical Upgrade 2.0" class="wp-image-202272" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-789-1024x561.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-789-300x164.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-789-768x421.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-789-750x411.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-789-1140x625.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-789.png 1177w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="NFT Lending Protocol ParaSpace Announces Upcoming Critical Upgrade 2.0 11"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Main objects of operation on the ParaSpace platform:</p>



<ul>
<li>Borrower (Borrower): Deposit NFT on the platform as collateral to borrow a corresponding amount and receive nToken (NFT standard ERC 721) representing the mortgaged NFT. In addition, Borrower can also use other collateral assets such as tokens and LP tokens on Uniswap V3, vToken (mint on NFTX), Aave&#8217;s aTokens, and Compound&#8217;s cTokens.</li>



<li>Lender (Lender): Send assets (tokens) to the platform to receive interest.</li>
</ul>



<p>However, recently, the team that developed this NFT lending protocol had an <a href="https://coincu.com/186740-paraspace-civil-war-continues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">internal dispute</a> when it asked CEO Yubo Ruan to resign, accusing Yubo Ruan of misappropriating the 2,909 ETH recovered from the March hack.</p>



<p>In the opposite direction, Ruan confirmed that the above article was fabricated. He alleged that two former advisors, Thomas Schmidt, and Jay Yao, now the current COO and CBO, are illegally gaining control of the protocol&#8217;s multisig and Twitter accounts. Ruan asserted that after receiving the funds from BlockSec, &#8220;myself, Thomas, Jay, and other important parties&#8221; planned the refinancing in phases.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>ParaSpace was hacked on the afternoon of March 17, 2023, but was able to stop the hack in time. At that time, BlockSec helped ParaSpace recover 2,900 ETH ($5 million) right before the risk of losing everything. On-chain inspection, the project found that about 50% of the funds remained unreimbursed, causing a hole in the protocol treasury. From there, internal disputes broke out.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Circle, the stablecoin issuer, has announced staff reductions and a focus on core business activities to improve its balance sheet.</em></li>



<li><em>The layoffs at Circle follow similar moves by other cryptocurrency companies in response to challenging market conditions and regulatory pressures.</em></li>



<li><em>Circle continues to prioritize key areas of focus and has recently appointed a former chairman of the CFTC as its new chief legal officer.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Circle, the stablecoin issuer, has made staff reductions and ended investments in non-core activities in an effort to strengthen its balance sheet. The company&#8217;s actions come as a response to the challenging environment faced by the cryptocurrency sector, which has experienced declining prices and reduced investor confidence.</strong></h5>

<p>Several other cryptocurrency firms have also announced layoffs this year, including Coinbase Global, Chainalysis, and Gemini. The industry suffered significant losses in 2022, with over a trillion dollars wiped out.</p>



<p>In an email shared with <em><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/07/12/circle-cuts-workforce-ends-certain-non-core-activities-will-continue-hiring-globally/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinDesk</a></em>, Circle&#8217;s spokesperson emphasized the company&#8217;s commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet by focusing on core business activities and execution. They mentioned that while some non-core investments have been reduced or terminated, new areas for investment have been identified, and the company continues to hire in key areas globally.</p>

<p>The layoffs at <a href="https://coincu.com/200703-circle-released-web3-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Circle</a> reflect a broader trend of staff reductions occurring within the cryptocurrency industry. Earlier this year, in January, crypto trading platform Blockchain.com announced a 28% reduction in its workforce due to significant headwinds faced by the crypto sector. Similarly, crypto exchange Crypto.com decreased its global workforce by 20%, citing economic headwinds and unforeseeable industry events.</p>



<p>In June, Binance.US, a leading crypto exchange, <a href="https://coincu.com/195587-binanceus-fires-50-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laid off</a> approximately 50 employees in response to allegations of securities law violations made by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://coincu.com/196743-binanceus-market-share-falling-seriously/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">against</a> its parent company, Binance.</p>

<p>Another notable player in the space, blockchain analytics provider Nansen, announced in May that it would be reducing its staff by 30% after years of rapid expansion. The CEO of Nansen at the time described the previous year as &#8220;brutal&#8221; for the crypto sector.</p>



<p>In addition to the staffing changes, Circle recently made headlines with the appointment of Heath Tarbert, the former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), as its new chief legal officer in June. This appointment reflects Circle&#8217;s focus on regulatory compliance and underscores the company&#8217;s commitment to navigating the evolving landscape of the crypto industry.</p>



<p>These developments reflect the ongoing adjustments and challenges within the cryptocurrency industry as companies navigate market fluctuations and regulatory pressures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Google Play announces policy change allowing developers to incorporate digital assets, including NFTs, into their apps and games.</em></li>



<li><em>Developers must disclose the presence of blockchain elements and be transparent about tokenized digital assets to users.</em></li>



<li><em>The new policy aims to support innovation, user engagement, and loyalty through unique NFT rewards while ensuring a safe and trusted experience on the platform.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Google Play, the app store for Android smartphone users, has <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/07/new-blockchain-based-content-opportunities-google-play.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> a significant policy change that will allow developers to incorporate digital assets, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs), into their apps and games. The move aims to support developers&#8217; ambitions by enabling them to expand their blockchain-based offerings on the platform.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-780.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-780-1024x576.png" alt="Google Play Now Changes Policy, Allowing Digital Assets In Apps And Games" class="wp-image-202240" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-780-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-780-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-780-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-780-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-780-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-780.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Google Play Now Changes Policy, Allowing Digital Assets In Apps And Games 17"></a></figure></div>


<p>Under the new policy, companies offering the ability to buy, sell, or earn tokenized assets must clearly disclose the presence of blockchain elements within their apps. The transparency requirement ensures that users are aware of the tokenized digital assets within the app and prohibits developers from promoting or glamorizing potential earnings from playing or trading activities.</p>



<p>Google Play&#8217;s group product manager, Joseph Mills, emphasized the importance of balancing innovation and user protection. The updated policy allows partners to reimagine traditional games by integrating user-owned content and leveraging unique NFT rewards to enhance user loyalty.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Google Play hosts a variety of blockchain related apps, and we know that our partners are excited to expand on these offerings to create more engaging and immersive digital experiences with tokenized digital assets such as NFTs. Like with any emerging technology, we must balance innovation with our responsibility to protect users. So, we’ve spoken with developers about responsibly supporting those opportunities while continuing to provide a safe, transparent, and trusted experience for everyone.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However, apps that violate Google Play&#8217;s Real-Money Gambling, Games, and Contests policy or fail to meet eligibility requirements cannot accept payments for chances to win assets, including NFTs. This includes mechanisms such as &#8220;loot boxes&#8221; that offer randomized blockchain-based items with purchases.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-781.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="565" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-781-1024x565.png" alt="Google Play Now Changes Policy, Allowing Digital Assets In Apps And Games" class="wp-image-202242" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-781-1024x565.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-781-300x166.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-781-768x424.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-781-750x414.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-781-1140x629.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-781.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Google Play Now Changes Policy, Allowing Digital Assets In Apps And Games 18"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Axie Infinity: Origins on Google Play</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Google expects users to start experiencing in-app and game experiences leveraging digital assets later this summer. A select group of developers is currently testing the new policy before its wider rollout to all developers on Google Play later this year.</p>



<p>While Google is embracing the integration of digital assets, including NFTs, within apps, Apple has been more cautious and slower to adopt similar functionalities on its iPhone platform.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-782.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="900" height="500" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-782.png" alt="Google Play Now Changes Policy, Allowing Digital Assets In Apps And Games" class="wp-image-202244" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-782.png 900w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-782-300x167.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-782-768x427.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-782-750x417.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" title="Google Play Now Changes Policy, Allowing Digital Assets In Apps And Games 19"></a></figure></div>


<p>Google&#8217;s updated policy reflects a shift in attitude towards Web3 technologies. The company has recently allowed the decentralized data storage app ArDrive Mobile and the popular blockchain game <a href="https://coincu.com/159728-axie-infinity-launches-origins-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Axie Infinity: Origins</a> to be listed on <a href="https://coincu.com/184094-nba-top-shot-apple-store-google-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google Play</a>. Additionally, Google Cloud launched an initiative in April 2023 to support Web3 developers in accelerating their startups.</p>



<p>With these changes, Google Play aims to foster innovation in the blockchain space while ensuring a safe, transparent, and trusted experience for all users.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>CFTC obtained a default judgment against Adam Todd and his companies for operating an illegal digital asset exchange Digitex Futures.</em></li>



<li><em>Todd and his companies attempted to manipulate the price of the native token DGTX and offered futures transactions without proper registration.</em></li>



<li><em>The judgment bans Todd and his companies from trading in CFTC-regulated markets and imposes significant penalties</em>.</li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a recent development, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida has <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8748-23" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued</a> a default judgment against Florida resident Adam Todd and his affiliated companies &#8211; Digitex LLC, Digitex Limited, Digitex Software Limited, and Blockster Holdings Limited Corporation.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CFTC_detail.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CFTC_detail-1024x683.jpg" alt="Digitex Futures Founder Hits With Default Judgment By CFTC For Illegal Activities" class="wp-image-202227" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CFTC_detail-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CFTC_detail-300x200.jpg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CFTC_detail-768x512.jpg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CFTC_detail-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CFTC_detail-750x500.jpg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CFTC_detail-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CFTC_detail.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Digitex Futures Founder Hits With Default Judgment By CFTC For Illegal Activities 20"></a></figure></div>


<p>The judgment comes as a result of their involvement in illegal activities related to their digital asset exchange, operating under the name &#8220;Digitex Futures.&#8221;</p>



<p>The court ruling states that Todd and his companies attempted to manipulate the price of their native token, DGTX, engaged in illegal futures transactions, failed to register with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and neglected to implement essential compliance measures such as a customer information program, know your customer policies, and anti-money laundering procedures.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-777.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="600" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-777.png" alt="Digitex Futures Founder Hits With Default Judgment By CFTC For Illegal Activities" class="wp-image-202230" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-777.png 1000w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-777-300x180.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-777-768x461.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-777-750x450.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" title="Digitex Futures Founder Hits With Default Judgment By CFTC For Illegal Activities 21"></a></figure></div>


<p>As a result, the court has permanently enjoined Todd and his companies from trading in any CFTC-regulated markets and from registering with the CFTC. Additionally, Todd has been ordered to pay $3,912,220 in disgorgement and a civil monetary penalty of $11,736,660. This judgment effectively resolves the CFTC&#8217;s enforcement action against Todd and Digitex Futures.</p>



<p>Ian McGinley, the Director of the CFTC&#8217;s Division of Enforcement, highlighted the importance of the ruling, stating:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;This order resolves yet another action against an individual and digital asset exchange illegally offering futures contracts to U.S. customers. The order finds that Todd attempted to manipulate Digitex&#8217;s native utility token, DGTX, by allegedly &#8216;pumping&#8217; the token&#8217;s price through the use of a computerized bot. This case demonstrates that regardless of the technology used, the CFTC will aggressively use its well-established authority to ensure entities are lawfully registered and to address the manipulation of commodities in interstate commerce.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The case against Todd and Digitex Futures originated from a complaint filed by the <a href="https://coincu.com/200430-cftc-sue-celsius-and-former-ceo-earlier-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CFTC</a> on September 30, 2022. The complaint alleged that between May 2020 and May 2022, Todd and his company operated a digital asset derivatives exchange from Florida, targeting U.S. customers despite being subject to U.S. regulation.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-778-1024x768.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-778-1024x768.png" alt="Digitex Futures Founder Hits With Default Judgment By CFTC For Illegal Activities" class="wp-image-202231" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-778-1024x768.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-778-300x225.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-778-768x576.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-778-1536x1152.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-778-750x563.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-778-1140x855.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-778.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Digitex Futures Founder Hits With Default Judgment By CFTC For Illegal Activities 22"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Adam Todd</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The CFTC charged Todd with attempting to manipulate DGTX, the native token of the Digitex Futures exchange. Todd&#8217;s alleged actions included artificially inflating the price of DGTX through the use of a bot and engaging in large over-the-counter purchases from third-party exchanges. These manipulative practices were intended to boost the price of DGTX, benefiting the Digitex &#8220;treasury&#8221; despite the potential trading losses incurred.</p>



<p>The court&#8217;s judgment affirms the CFTC&#8217;s claims of attempted manipulation and other charges related to the interstate commerce of commodities.</p>



<p>While the CFTC cautions that victims may not recover their lost funds due to insufficient assets held by wrongdoers, it remains committed to protecting customers and holding wrongdoers accountable for their actions.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has transferred 9,825 Bitcoin linked to the Silk Road darknet marketplace to new addresses in two transactions.</em></li>



<li><em>The DOJ previously sold 9,800 BTC to Coinbase for $215 million and plans to sell the remaining balance of over 40,000 Bitcoins in multiple installments this year.</em></li>



<li><em>There is controversy surrounding the transfers as the assets may potentially be moved back to their original wallets under new addresses, and the transactions are currently experiencing confirmation delays due to insufficient transaction fees of only $8.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>According to on-chain statistics, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) confiscated 9,825 Bitcoin worth $302 million in connection with the defunct darknet marketplace Silk Road which were relocated to different addresses earlier today, July 12.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/7dcbeff9e6da0f4ec5133d2f8b6fbe8bb73e05c5ddc8f5e410d408f8150e02ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blockchair dashboard</a>, the BTC was transmitted to new addresses in two transactions<a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/bc1qe7nk2nlnjewghgw4sgm0r89zkjzsurda7z4rdg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">.</a></p>

<p>A total of 8,200 Bitcoin are being moved to new wallets. The remaining monies are being transferred to new wallets, and there is some controversy about whether this constitutes as formally migrating since these assets may be transferred back to their original wallets under new addresses.</p>



<p>The first transaction sends 0.01 BTC to the wallet 361yog, but the second sends 506 BTC to a different address. These monies come from two wallets, the most important of which is this one.</p>



<p>Yet, US goverment <a href="https://coincu.com/177726-u-s-government-to-sell-41500-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold</a> 9,800 BTC straight to the US-based site Coinbase in March for $21,800 each token, making $215 million. The authorities indicated intentions at the moment to sell the over 40,000 Bitcoin balance in four installments this calendar year.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://coincu.com/196794-explosive-twist-cryptoquant-ceo-silk-road/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silk Road Bitcoin</a> refers to the more than 50,000 BTC confiscated from <a href="https://coincu.com/181499-silk-road-hacker-received-one-year-jail/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">James Zhong</a> by the US authorities in 2022. Zhong hacked the dark web marketplace to steal cash in 2012, and it took almost a decade for the authorities to retrieve the stolen assets.</p>

<p>The Department of Justice&#8217;s outstanding Silk Road transactions are presently encountering a confirmation delay, which might be caused by insufficient transaction costs.</p>



<p>The DOJ seems to have set aside a pittance of $8 in fees for these transactions. Bitcoin blocks are processed once every 10 minutes on average.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The Fantom Foundation is facing persistent interruptions and security problems with the Multichain protocol, leading to substantial financial losses and concerns for users.</em></li>



<li><em>As a response, the foundation is exploring alternative chains such as Axelar and LayerZero as network bridging technologies to reduce reliance on Multichain.</em></li>



<li><em>Recent exploits resulting in significant fund transfers have prompted Multichain to temporarily cease operations, while the absence of Multichain&#8217;s CEO has raised suspicions of an inside job.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>After a number of security problems involving the Multichain bridge in which huge sums of crypto assets were transferred under questionable circumstances in two distinct events, the Fantom Foundation is taking strong action. The foundation acknowledged the tough situation that the current Multichain breach had placed Liquidity Providers (LPs), token holders, and general protocol users in.</p>



<p>The Fantom Foundation officially acknowledged the canonical bridge within the network. It serves as a reminder to the community of the ecosystem&#8217;s variety and adaptability in terms of infrastructure.</p>



<p>The development prompted the foundation to recommend Axelar and LayerZero as alternate network bridging technologies. It was also said that Axelar and LayerZero are gaining momentum as a result of the <a href="https://coincu.com/201729-multichain-record-265-million-withdrawn-9-chains/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Multichain</a> issues.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;In light of the current events, the Fantom Foundation is taking a hands-on approach toward reducing the network&#8217;s reliance on any one particular solution for bridging and liquidity. With this, the Foundation will look to seed both Axelar and LayerZero issued asset pools directly with the bridges themselves to encourage protocol liquidity and confidence.&#8221;</p>

<p>A possible exploit earlier this month resulted in the transfer of $125 million, followed by another transfer of $103 million in various assets. After the first outflow, Multichain advised users to stop using the project and cancel contract permissions, however, a significant quantity of assets remained on the network.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/200938-fantom-foundation-ftm-unaffected-multichains/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fantom Foundation</a> said that it is currently awaiting an official announcement from Multichain as well as instructions on its future moves. Remember that the most recent breach discovered by Arkham Intelligence resulted in the theft of around $125 million in various tokens from the Multichain Bridge. The company immediately ceased operations in order to mitigate the devastation caused by this exploit.</p>

<p>The foundation recognized Multichain&#8217;s higher share as the major bridge that supports consumers inside its ecosystem. This situation is growing intolerable, and the protocol has said that it will look for alternate options.</p>



<p>Some experts are becoming more concerned about an inside job. The <a href="https://coincu.com/191300-multichain-lost-contact-with-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">absence</a> of Multichain&#8217;s CEO, whose whereabouts are unknown, has fanned concerns.</p>
