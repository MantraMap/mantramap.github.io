<p>The USDC stablecoin saga continues as leading cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase attempts to ease the conversion process of USDT holders looking to convert their USDT to USDC. The onlooker brand strategic move comes not long after Binance halted all of the USDC trading pairs on its platform.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-war-between-stablecoins-and-exchanges-drags-on"><strong>The war between Stablecoins and exchanges drags on</strong></h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/switch-to-the-trusted-and-reputable-digital-dollar-usdc">blog post</a> published on Coinbase’s website, dated 8th December, Coinbase highlights its support for USDC with a compelling blog title that reads “Switch to the trusted and reputable digital dollar: USDC.”</p>



<p>The blog post essentially goes over USDC’s admirable quality, highlighting a <em>“high-quality reserve”</em> as one of its upsides. Keep in mind that USDT has, in the past, been critiqued for lack of transparency on its reserve. USDT has also been accused of lying about its equal backing to the U.S. dollar.</p>



<p>The allegations put stablecoins like USDC in a better position for adoption amongst stablecoin users and holders. Pitching USDC to users as the most reputable stablecoin in the market, Coinbase scraps out conversion fees for retail users.</p>



<p>Excerpts of the blog post reads; </p>



<p><em>“However, the events of the past few weeks have put some stablecoins to the test and we’ve seen a flight to safety. We believe that USD Coin (USDC) is a trusted and reputable stablecoin, so we’re making it more frictionless to switch: starting today we’re waiving fees for global retail customers to convert USDT to USDC.“</em></p>



<p>The move could cause trading volume for USDC to surge on Coinbase, especially considering that USDT traded below $1 for a large part of November.</p>



<p>Explaining how the conversion structure is patterned, Coinbase added that there will be “<em>No commission fee or spread for USDT to USDC conversions on Coinbase Simple Trade in eligible regions, until further notice. Conversion rate is determined at trade execution, and is subject to market volatility. Not investment advice. Standard fees apply on Coinbase Advanced Trade, Prime, and Exchange.</em>&#8220;</p>



<p>Recall that Binance, another leading exchange, had <a href="https://zycrypto.com/why-binance-is-booting-usdc-two-other-stablecoins-out-of-exchange-in-favor-of-busd/">delisted three stablecoins</a> back in September. USDP, TUSD, and USDC training pairs were removed from the platform. On the 29th of September, Binance concluded the conversion of the aforementioned stablecoins to BUSD. </p>

<p>Ripple’s top lawyer Stuart Alderoty has again taken to Twitter to meticulously counter the allegations made by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the ongoing <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-attorney-reveals-ripples-biggest-danger-in-sec-case-as-it-edges-towards-gigantic-win/">high-profile suit</a>.</p>



<p>Alderoty reiterated the blockchain payments firm’s defence while taking aim at the agency and skeptics.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-xrp-suit-ending-soon"><strong>Is XRP Suit Ending Soon?</strong></h2>



<p>Ripple’s general counsel Stuart Alderoty argues that there is no investment contract because there’s no formal contract between the company and purchasers. Alderoty further noted that the SEC has failed to satisfy any of the limbs of the infamous Howey Test. He also points out that the commission’s reliance on precedent initial coin offering (ICO) cases has no bearing on the XRP lawsuit.</p>



<p>Ripple was sued in December 2020 for allegedly raising more than $1.3 billion through an unregistered securities offering. The case is one of the biggest crypto suits before the SEC, and it has attracted a great deal of media coverage because of the popularity of the XRP cryptocurrency, which is used in Ripple’s payment network.</p>



<p>The case is also approaching conclusion after a gruelling two-year-long battle. Earlier this month, Ripple and the SEC filed redacted replies to each other’s opposition to motions <a href="https://zycrypto.com/secs-battle-with-ripple-labs-nears-its-end-following-parties-application-for-summary-judgement/">for summary judgment</a>.</p>



<p>Notably, Ripple’s Alderoty states that the regulator is striving to alter the firm’s arguments as they have no answers to the aforementioned ones that it makes. In this vein, he notes that the SEC should at least try to understand Ripple’s legal positions before trying to debunk them.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The reason the SEC and detractors try to recast our arguments is they have no answer for the arguments we actually make.</p>&mdash; Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) <a href="https://twitter.com/s_alderoty/status/1600535890253991936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 7, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>In another recent tweet, Alderoty agreed that the long-drawn case might be nearing the end. </p>



<h2><strong>Significance of Ripple Case In Crypto Regulation</strong></h2>



<p>It’s common practice for companies under the SEC microscope to settle allegations quietly without going to trial, which is why Ripple’s case is so rare —&nbsp; offering a courtroom test of the law. Ripple pledges to fight the suit right to the Supreme Court. According to Alderoty, the company is proud of the defense it has mounted so far on behalf of the entire cryptocurrency industry.</p>



<p>Win or lose, Ripple is likely to set an example for peers. Whether its native cryptocurrency XRP falls within the parameters of what constitutes a security will ultimately be for the court to decide.</p>



<p>That being said, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-will-ripple-lose-to-the-us-sec-this-crypto-pundit-believes-so/">Ripple losing</a> would essentially give the SEC the ammunition it needs to go after other companies in the cryptoverse. In other words, the result of that legal wrangle could permanently alter the fate of crypto trading.</p>

<p>Cardano supporters assert that 2023 will be a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardanos-self-regulated-stablecoin-set-for-launch-in-early-2023-is-ada-ready-for-a-go-at-1/">highly bullish year</a> for the Cardano network&#8217;s ecosystem and native token ADA.</p>



<p>In a recent Twitter thread, pseudonymous Cardano community pundit and ambassador &#8216;ADA Whale&#8217; revealed why he believes the coming year will be massive for the network.</p>



<p>&#8216;ADA Whale&#8217; stated that with governance coming in 2023, Cardano is set to turn the tables on other blockchain networks as opposed to what has been playing out in 2020-2022, where Cardano has been &#8220;mostly playing catch up&#8221; and letting them set the narrative.</p>



<p>With governance, Cardano will be self-governed and start taking things in a more ambitious direction than flipping shitcoins. According to the pundit, this will shock the blockchain space and get participants in other networks demanding on-chain self-governance.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;The real shock to the system will come when they realize that to many there’s more appeal in joining a global digital people’s movement that wants to improve the world, rules itself and has a fully loaded treasury at its disposal, than there is to becoming a wannabe banker,&#8221; he wrote.</em></p>



<h2 id="h-how-will-governance-put-cardano-ahead-of-other-networks"><strong>How will governance put Cardano ahead of other networks?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>&#8216;ADA Whale&#8217; isn&#8217;t the only Cardano community member bullish on the new era the network is set to enter. Back in October, CEO of IOG <a href="https://zycrypto.com/charles-hoskinson-claims-ethereum-lags-behind-cardano-despite-transition-to-proof-of-stake/">Charles Hoskinson</a> stated that the era dubbed the Age of Voltaire—after the 17th-century French philosopher and prolific writer—will teach other industry players &#8220;how to do decentralized governance.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Voltaire era will essentially see Cardano become fully autonomous by introducing voting and treasury systems to mark the complete decentralization of the network.</p>



<p>According to an IOG blog post, Cardano is already testing running treasury mechanisms in Project Catalyst—Cardano&#8217;s ecosystem support program—which combines research, social experiments, and community consent to establish open, a democratic culture within the Cardano community.</p>



<p>The initiative will ultimately remove Cardano core companies like IOG, the Cardano Foundation, and Emurgo from the driving seat of the network and place all future advancement decisions in the hands of the entire community.</p>



<p>The network has also started to see benefits from upgrades carried out this year, including the Vasil hardfork, which has cut transaction fees and block space consumption.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the price of ADA has continued to trade far below its previous all-time high (ATH) of about $3 reached in Sept. 2021. At press time, ADA was trading at around $0.31, up 1.95% in the last 24 hours and 89.9% from ATH. </p>

<li>The exchange had previously cancelled the policy of charging fees on Bitcoin (BTC) as it pushed to become the leading platform in the industry.</li>



<li>Binance.US is eyeing expansion outside of the U.S. mainland after gaining new licenses.</li>
</ul>



<p>Binance.US has <a href="https://twitter.com/BinanceUS/status/1600496453151068160?s=20&amp;t=Bn2F3Q3660jg39THM6otKQ">unveiled</a> an early Christmas gift for users by removing trading fees for ETH while offering additional discounts for customers that pay trading fees with BNB.</p>



<p>The U.S. iteration of Binance has officially cancelled the requirement of trading fees for users that buy and sell ETH on the platform. The new policy will apply immediately to the spot market pairs of ETH/USD, ETH/USDT, ETH/USDC, and ETH/BUSD.</p>



<p>Gas fees will also not be charged for all ETH transactions made through the “Buy and Sell” feature on the platform. In addition, Binance.US also announced perks for customers using BNB to pay their trading fees as it looks to cement its place as the foremost exchange in the industry.</p>



<p><em>“By eliminating fees first on BTC and now ETH, we are raising awareness for the high fees consumers are paying on other platforms, and helping to restore trust in the greater ecosystem,”</em> said Brian Shroder, Binance.US CEO. “Now more than ever, it’s critical that platforms operate with users’ interest first.”</p>



<p>In June, Binance.US removed all charges relating to Bitcoin (BTC) transactions in a move that mirrors the decision of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-trading-for-over-17-million-robinhood-users-is-a-mind-blowing-shib-moonshot-incoming/">Robinhood</a> to introduce no-commission trading of digital assets back in 2018.</p>



<p>Digital asset exchanges typically rake in profits by charging a percentage on each trade, but even with the elimination of trading fees, exchanges can still earn on spreads. The decision of Binance.US to remove trading fees has been hailed as one that has the potential to improve the adoption rates of the asset class.</p>



<h2 id="h-binance-us-spreads-its-tentacles"><strong>Binance.US spreads its tentacles</strong></h2>



<p>Binance.US disclosed that the top agenda is to gain a license in all 50 states before the end of the year. In line with the goals, the exchange went on to snag licenses in Louisiana and Colorado after confirming that it was on track to achieve the target.</p>



<p>With only three weeks to go until the end of the year, the exchange has yet to obtain an operational license in Hawaii, New York, Texas, and Vermont. However, it has successfully launched operations in the U.S. territories of American Samoa and Guam.</p>

<p>Gene Hoffman, chief operating officer at blockchain company Chia Network, believes <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-attorney-reveals-ripples-biggest-danger-in-sec-case-as-it-edges-towards-gigantic-win/">Ripple</a> will lose against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>



<p>Hoffman made the prediction in a tweet, noting an excerpt from the SEC&#8217;s summary judgment filing where the regulator argued that its former director of corporate finance, Bill Hinman, told Ripple executives back in 2019 that in his opinion, XRP was a security.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Did you know that Bill Hinman told Ripple leadership that XRP was a security in his opinion in 2019? Neither did I&#8230; Prepare for the post Ripple SEC loss future <a href="https://t.co/MmD79MRL5l">https://t.co/MmD79MRL5l</a> <a href="https://t.co/yykUsTVSfY">pic.twitter.com/yykUsTVSfY</a></p>&mdash; Gene Hoffman hoffmang.xch <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f331.png" alt="🌱" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@hoffmang) <a href="https://twitter.com/hoffmang/status/1599864709741965312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Hoffman, a former public company CEO, says that aside from the Hinman statement, the federal judges are also sceptical enough to know that most people bought XRP, hoping the numbers would go up.</p>



<p>Based on this, he maintained that the only outcome from the case is that a judge will rule that Ripple&#8217;s sales of XRP made XRP a security and XRP proponents&#8217; argument that the token has utility will not fly.</p>



<p>He also asserted that there is little difference between XRP in the Ripple case and the LBRY Credits (LBC) tokens in the LBRY case in which the SEC <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-ripples-chances-of-winning-case-against-sec-revealed-following-lbrys-defeat/">just recently won</a> a favourable ruling. According to Hoffman, the SEC has not lost a section 5 violation case in a long while.</p>



<h2 id="h-xrp-aficionados-still-confident-of-a-win-against-the-sec"><strong>XRP aficionados still confident of a win against the SEC</strong></h2>



<p>Hoffman&#8217;s take has been met with stiff opposition from the XRP community. According to attorney John Deaton, Hoffman is taking the excerpt out of context as it refers to a personal opinion of Hinman and not the opinion of the SEC.</p>



<p>Deaton explains that shortly after the meeting in which Hinman made the statements the SEC is referring to, securities enforcement lawyers at the commission produced an XRP Howey Test Memo.</p>



<p>The XRP community knows that this memo did not conclude that XRP was a security as Hinman again had an opportunity to meet with Ripple executives and did not provide definitive advice on whether or not XRP was a security, Deaton asserted.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Certainly, if the XRP Howey Memo had concluded XRP is a security, Clayton &amp; Hinman would’ve informed [Brad Garlinghouse] &amp; [Joel Katz] that it was a security when Garlinghouse spoke out about purgatory. They would’ve said &#8216;XRP is a security and that’s why it wasn’t given clarity,'&#8221; Deaton wrote.</em></p>



<p>The crypto space is following the case closely as it enters the final stages. With both the SEC and Ripple recently filing motions for summary judgment, a conclusion of the case <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-defense-lawyer-believes-judge-in-ripple-case-will-soon-deliver-one-big-written-ruling/">is expected</a> from the judge in the next few months.</p>

<p>House Financial Services Committee Chair Maxine Waters has confirmed they will subpoena Sam Bankman Fried (SBF) if the disgraced ex-FTX CEO fails to turn up for a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/the-u-s-congress-is-set-for-a-string-of-hearings-after-the-ftx-collapse/">probe session at Capitol Hill</a> following an earlier “request.”</p>



<p>Waters made the comments earlier today while responding to claims that she did not plan to subpoena Sam to testify at the hearing on FTX collapse.</p>



<p>“<em>Lies are circulating at CNBC that I am not willing to subpoena SBF_FTX,”</em> Tweeted waters. “<em>He has been requested to testify at the December 13th hearing. A subpoena is definitely on the table. Stay tuned.”</em></p>



<p>On November 7, CNBC reported-citing undisclosed sources-that the lawmaker had told some Democrats she did not have plans on subpoenaing SBF in a private meeting attended by Gary Gensler, chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission Chair on Capitol Hill. Consequently, Waters had reportedly said that “she wants committee staff to try to convince Bankman-Fried to voluntarily testify.”</p>



<p>Last week <a href="https://zycrypto.com/elon-musk-questions-sbfs-donations-to-democrats-says-they-could-be-more-than-1b/">Waters came under fire</a> from a section of observers after she used obsequious language when inviting SBF for a committee hearing slated for Dec 13. Replying to the invite on Monday, SBF noted that he would only appear for the meeting once he was prepared, failing to commit to the said date.</p>



<p>“<em>Once I have finished learning and reviewing what happened, I would feel like it was my duty to appear before the committee and explain. I&#8217;m not sure that will happen by the 13th. But when it does, I will testify,”</em> Sam tweeted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Water’s comments come even as the number of people calling for Bankman-Fried’s arrest surges. The lawmaker’s ability to conduct impartial hearings on the FTX fiasco, however has become a subject of concern given the seemingly cordial relationship displayed between herself and SBF.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with FOX, Waters avoided answering when asked if democrats who received campaign cash from FTX should give it back, saying, &#8220;<em>Well, I don&#8217;t want to get into that. As a matter of fact, both sides, Democrats and Republicans, have received donations. So, thank you.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>That said, although she has yet to comment on the impartiality concerns, the crypto community could find comfort in the fact that her term comes to an end on January 3 when Republicans take control of the House. It is widely felt that Patrick McHenry (NC-10), who is likely to be the next chair, will become the first to subpoena SBF if he fails to testify under oath voluntarily next week. </p>



<p>As of writing, Sam was yet to agree to testify to the house committee voluntarily.</p>

<p>Do Kwon has accused FTX’s founder Sam Bankman-Fried and Alameda Research of manipulating the market, leading to the collapse of TerraUSD in May.</p>



<p>In a thread of tweets today, the embattled Terraform Labs co-founder sought explanations on the mystery of large transactions involving large chime crypto lending firms and Alameda shortly before Terra’s crash.</p>



<p><em>“I think the time has come for Genesis Trading to reveal if they provided the $1B UST shortly before the crash to SBF or Alameda,” </em>said Kwon. Bankruptcy documents have also shown that Alameda borrowed 9 figures in Bitcoin from the now cash-beleaguered lender Voyager on TerraUSD’s depeg date. On the same dates, Alameda is said to have asked other large firms to borrow more cash, raising suspicions of a plan to short BTC to handicap Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) reserves.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-done-in-darkness-will-come-to-light"><strong>“What’s Done In Darkness Will Come To Light”</strong></h2>



<p>According to Kwon, while Terra’s crash came in May, the plot to bring down the ecosystem had manifested much earlier.</p>



<p><em>“This is fairly public knowledge at this point, but the large currency contraction that UST went through in Feb 2021 was started by Alameda, when they sold 500mm UST in minutes to drain its curve pools during the MIM crisis,”</em> he said.</p>



<p>Following that shakeup, Kwon set up a plan to purchase up to $10 billion in Bitcoin to support the stability of the UST stablecoin. Early May, LFG, the nonprofit organization built to support Terra would announce that it had <a href="https://zycrypto.com/terras-lfg-leaps-into-top-10-largest-bitcoin-whales-with-an-extra-1-5-billion-btc-buy/">received $1.5 billion</a> in Bitcoin for its UST stablecoin reserves from Genesis Trading and Three Arrows Capital after a counter swap of UST for Bitcoin. Days after LUNA’s crash, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/hedge-funds-launch-coordinated-attack-on-tethers-usdt-following-terra-luna-crash/">reports of a possible conspiracy</a> involving top-notch hedge funds and crypto lending firm to topple terraUST started making rounds. </p>



<p>“<em>What’s Done In Darkness Will Come To Light,”</em> he concluded.</p>



<p>Kwon’s claims come even as reports emerge that Federal prosecutors are investigating whether Sam Bankman-Fried and his hedge fund orchestrated trades in a way that led to the collapse of Luna and TerraUSD(UST).</p>



<p>According to a Dec 7 report by the New York Times(NYT), although Fried said that he was “<em>not aware of any market manipulation and certainly never intended to engage in market manipulation</em>,” people familiar with the matter noted that a majority of sell orders for Terra USD had been traced to Alameda, which has also placed a big bet on the price of LUNA falling.</p>



<p>That said, as Mr Fried continues to take fire following the collapse of his trading firm, the emergence of market manipulation claims touching on Terra adds to the legal storm brewing around the businessman.</p>

<ul>
<li>The popular play-to-earn token surged by double-digit on December 5.</li>



<li>Rising NFT activity and the latest community update are behind the gains.</li>
</ul>



<p>Axie Infinity (AXS), an NFT online video game and cryptocurrency, has gained 21% in the last seven days to become the top gainer, trading at $8.49 at press time. The uptrend has pushed the market cap of the play-to-earn crypto to $853 billion. Currently, the daily trading volumes stand at $389 million (an increase of 927% from the previous day), according to data retrieved from CoinMarketCap.</p>



<h2 id="h-sand-mana-and-ape-are-also-among-the-best-performers"><strong>SAND, MANA, and APE are also among the best performers</strong></h2>



<p>The Sandbox (SAND), Decentraland (MANA), and ApeCoin (APE) look bullish as cryptos open the month positively. SAND has added 5% in the past day, topping 12% in the weekly chart. MANA has climbed 3% and 8%, respectively, in the two timeframes. APE, also among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market valuation, added a modest 1.23% &#8211; with trading volumes up 77% to $190 million.</p>



<p>Also known as Axie Infinity Shards, AXS’ rally comes after the blockchain released its decentralization update. In a blog post, Axie Infinity shared the following steps to undertake, including establishing an urban planning team and identifying and creating community contributors. The blockchain is also planning to empower and equip the community council.</p>



<h2 id="h-axie-infinity-is-planning-more-decentralization"><strong>Axie Infinity is planning more decentralization</strong></h2>



<p>‘‘We are still early, but over the past months, we have made considerable headway in operationalizing these steps,’’ the post read, adding that it is ‘‘creating the framework to allow for progressive decentralization to initiate and take hold.’’ The post stated that Axie Infinity now has about 700 Lunacians set to join the inaugural pilot of the Axie contributors.</p>



<p>AXS’ surge could also be attributed to an increase in NFT sales volumes. According to data from CryptoSlam, the volumes have ranged between $18,000 and $48,000 in the past few weeks. The crypto market valuation has increased 0.3% to $840 billion as Bitcoin and Ethereum register daily gains. BTC added 2.17% to an intraday high of $16,827, while ETH rose to $1,252.</p>

<p>Michael Saylor has said that XRP is a security, noting that the cryptocurrency falls under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The self-declared Bitcoin HODLer expressed strong views when speaking on the PBD podcast earlier on Tuesday.</p>



<p>“<em>XRP is an unregistered security,”</em> Saylor said when asked about his thoughts on the embattled cryptocurrency. <em>“It’s pretty obvious. There’s a company. The company owns a bunch of it, they sell it to the general public, but they never took the company public, there is no disclosures. So the SEC position is you’re selling an unregistered security,”</em> he added.</p>



<p>Saylor went on to argue that except Bitcoin, which did not have a known creator, all other cryptocurrencies fulfilled the threshold of an investment contract. According to the US Securities Act, an investment contract is described as an investment of money in a common enterprise relying upon the efforts of others and expecting a profit.</p>



<p>Apart from bitcoin, “<em>all these other tokens are unregistered securities. They are all just equity tokens issued by a company in order to get around going public and they are committing securities fraud,”</em> Saylor added.</p>



<p>The former CEO of business intelligence company MicroStrategy went on to charge at Ethereum, noting that it was equally a security, despite earlier statements by the CFTC that it <a href="https://zycrypto.com/is-ether-eth-a-security-cftc-commissioner-brian-quintenz-gives-definitive-answer/">was a commodity</a>.</p>



<p><em>“You know Ethereum has got $20 billion of Ether token locked up in the staking contract right now and there is a couple of people who may or may not give it back to you every. Now isn’t that the definition of an investment contract?”</em> he asked.</p>



<p>According to him, one did not need to look far to conclude. “<em>If the person can make a decision, it’s not a commodity anymore,”</em> he said, insisting that the fact that XRP, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies had companies and engineers to write to code, qualified them as securities.</p>



<p>He went on to state that the best thing for the world would be if the SEC would &#8220;pretty much shut down all of those token’s down since they were all unethical. Saylor’s comments come even as the crypto community eagerly awaits the decision in the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-attorney-reveals-ripples-biggest-danger-in-sec-case-as-it-edges-towards-gigantic-win/">SEC vs Ripple</a> lawsuit, which could have far-reaching ramifications on the industry, according to experts. </p>



<p>In August, Saylor came under fire after arguing that all legitimate talent works on top of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Pro-Ripple lawyer John Deaton found it “absurd” for Saylor to make the comments which implied almost everything other than BTC is a security.</p>

<ul>
<li>The platform aims to reduce data retention to seven days.</li>



<li>ConsenSys will also allow for the use of third-party RPCs and self-hosted nodes.</li>
</ul>



<p>ConsenSys, the company behind MetaMask and Remote Procedure Call (RPC) infrastructure Infura, has clarified how it handles data privacy after being criticized for collecting users’ wallet information and IP addresses. In a <a href="https://consensys.net/blog/news/consensys-data-retention-update/">blog</a> dated December 6, the blockchain software company issued a list of clarifications, commitments, and updates on the matter.</p>



<p>It notes that wallet addresses are not stored when users make a ‘read’ request like checking their account balances; the data is only collected when they make transaction requests. The reason for collecting the data, according to the company, is to enhance transaction initiation and execution and to protect the platform against security violations.</p>



<p>In addition, the New York City-based company assured its users that the data is stored so that the systems cannot relate an IP address and the wallet address. The report also noted that the retention period would be reduced to a week, and the data would not be sold to a third party.</p>



<p>‘‘We retain and delete user data such as IP address and wallet address pursuant to our data retention policy. We are working on narrowing retention to 7 days, and we will append these retention policies to our privacy policy in an upcoming update,’’ the announcement noted. ‘‘We never have and will never sell any user data we collect,’’ it added.</p>



<h2 id="h-consensys-to-allow-for-the-use-of-third-party-rpcs-and-self-hosted-nodes"><strong>ConsenSys to allow for the use of third-party RPCs and self-hosted nodes</strong></h2>



<p>ConsenSys is also updating the policy to allow users to use third-party RPCs or host their nodes. However, the company cautioned that such options did not have additional privacy. ‘‘ Alternative third-party RPC providers have different privacy policies and data practices, and self-hosting a node may make it even easier for people to associate your Ethereum accounts with your IP address,’’ the report warned.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>ConsenSys came under fire last month when it <a href="https://zycrypto.com/metamasks-temporary-ip-collection-causes-uproar-in-the-crypto-community/">opted</a> to collect wallet addresses on transactions, financial, marketing, and usage. Community users blamed the company for going against the very objectives of Web3. Adam Cochran, a partner at Cinneamhain Ventures, was one of the users who expressed his dissatisfaction terming the policy as an ‘‘unacceptable violation of user privacy.’’   </p>



<p>Infura is an API-based tool that allows developers to deploy applications on the Ethereum blockchain. The platform &#8211; which was acquired by ConsenSys in 2019 &#8211; serves more than 350,000 developers and notable Web 3.0 projects, including Uniswap and MakerDAO.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrency borrowing and lending platform Nexo has <a href="https://nexo.io/blog/nexo-announces-gradual-departure-from-the-united-states">announced</a> that it is withdrawing its products from the United States over the ‘‘coming months’’ over regulatory challenges. The announcement was made through the company&#8217;s website on December 5.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Our decision comes after more than 18 months of good-faith dialogue with US state and federal regulators, which has come to a dead end,&#8221; the statement read. &#8220;Despite inconsistent and changing positions among state and federal regulators, Nexo has engaged in a significant ongoing effort to proactively provide requested information and modify its business in response to their concerns,&#8221;</em> it added.</p>



<p>The company said it had been forced to exit certain states in the US to comply with the regulators. &#8220;During 2021 and 2022, we have off-boarded clients from New York and Vermont and suspended new registrations for all US clients for our Earn Interest Product,&#8221; it noted.</p>



<p>According to the company, the Earn Interest Product will no longer be available for existing clients in Indiana, Maryland, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Wisconsin, California, Washington, and South Carolina from December 6, 2022. However, Nexo assured users that it was proceeding with processing withdrawals instantly.</p>



<h2 id="h-concerns-arise-over-the-sustainability-of-nexo-s-high-yield-bearing-accounts"><strong>Concerns arise over the sustainability of Nexo&#8217;s high-yield-bearing accounts</strong></h2>



<p>Nexo came under fire in November when users questioned how the company offered up to 10% in its high-yield bearing product amid a bearish market following the collapse of FTX. Market analyst Dylan LeClair commented on Twitter: &#8220;Ask yourself how Nexo is paying 10% on stablecoins while DeFi yields are 1% and short duration US Treasuries are 4.5%.&#8221;</p>



<p>The firm&#8217;s co-founders, Antoni Trenchev and Kalin Metodiev, defended their company, saying that the platform is solvent. Metodiev said, &#8220;insolvency, bankruptcy, is nowhere in Nexo&#8217;s reality, and we believe, we hope, we aspire,&#8221; while working hard to deliver a strong and sustainable future to the users.&#8221;</p>



<p>The comments were in response to a cease and desist order against the digital asset lender from the California Department of Financial Protection on September 26. The regulator accused the 4-year-old firm of &#8220;offering and selling securities without prior qualification, in violation of California Corporations Code section 25110.&#8221;</p>



<p>The announcement comes amid market volatility that has forced Nexo&#8217;s rivals, including BlockFi, Voyager Digital, Celsius, and Three Arrows Capital, out of business. The collapse of the crypto derivatives exchanges FTX also pushed regulators to enforce more compliance in the space.</p>

<p>Silvergate bank has defended itself against allegations that it could be facing a liquidity crunch due to its close relationship with cash-beleaguered crypto exchange FTX and lending firm BlockFi.</p>



<p>Following the collapse of the two crypto firms, rumours that Silvergate could be facing a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ftx-comes-clean-and-admits-that-it-owes-over-3-billion-to-its-50-biggest-creditors/">potential bank run</a> after some experts exposed some glaring transactions with FTX have been pouring out.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-really-happened"><strong>What Really Happened?</strong></h2>



<p>On November 30, CFA-issued accountant Genevieve Roch-Decter brought to the crypto community’s attention a report by Silvergate that as of September 30, 2022, its <em>“total deposits from all digital asset customers totalled $11.9 billion, of which FTX represented less than 10%.”</em></p>



<p>Although Silvergate had put out a statement saying that exposure to FTX was “minimal” and that it only had deposits with FTX and no loans, Genevieve noted that “less than 10%” of $11.9 billion was “still a LOT of money.” She also called out the bank for downplaying its relationship with BlockFi to which it had said it owed less than $20 million.</p>



<p>The accountant then raised concerns over the bank&#8217;s Bitcoin-collateralized loans. As ZyCrypto reported, Silvergate gave the famous $205 million Bitcoin-backed loan to Michael Saylor. “If Bitcoin’s price continues to slide, will the borrowers be able to make their payments?” she had asked, pointing to the $1.392 billion in outstanding loans reported by the bank at the end of Q3.</p>



<p>The pundit, whose worries reflect those of many other experts, also noted that in just three weeks since the FTX meltdown, Silvergate’s stock had fallen by over 50% raising further concerns about the bank’s future.</p>



<h2><strong>Silvergate Responds</strong></h2>



<p>With pressures mounting, Silvergate Capital Corporation, the bank&#8217;s parent company’s CEO Alan Lane came out on Tuesday to “set the record straight” about the bank’s financial health.</p>



<p>“<em>There has also been plenty of speculation – and misinformation – being spread by short sellers and other opportunists trying to capitalize on market uncertainty,”</em> Lane said in a letter to shareholders on Tuesday.</p>



<p>The CEO noted that they had conducted extensive due diligence on FTX and Alameda Research before and after conducting business with the firms. He also assured customers of their funds’ safety saying that “<em>while this has been a turbulent time in the digital asset industry, our customers’ deposits are, and have always been, safely held.”</em></p>



<p>That said, Silvergate’s response seems not to have convinced many who have already seen FTX’s “domino effect” take down other companies. Later on Tuesday, three US Senators, Elizabeth Warren, Roger Marshall and John Kennedy, ordered the bank to release all records relating to FTX transfers.</p>



<p><em>“Your bank’s involvement in the transfer of FTX customer funds to Alameda reveals what appears to be an egregious failure of your bank’s responsibility to monitor for and report suspicious financial activity carried out by its clients,”</em> the senators said in a letter. <em>“The public is owed a full accounting of the financial activities that may have led to the loss of billions in customer assets, and any role that Silvergate may have played in these losses.”</em></p>

<p>Attorney John Deaton, the founder of Crypto Law and staunch Ripple supporter, has pointed out what he opined to be the biggest threat to Ripple securing a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-ripple-notches-another-legal-victory-as-judge-quashes-secs-latest-bid-to-strike-fair-notice-defense/">complete victory</a> over the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) even as the case draws to an end.</p>



<p>According to Deaton, this threat is the possibility that Judge Analisa Torres, the presiding judge in the case, could &#8220;split the proverbial baby&#8221; by ruling partially in favour of Ripple and the SEC.</p>



<p>Judge Torres could rule that Ripple &#8220;offered&#8221; an unregistered security at some point but that the XRP token itself is not a security, nor are secondary market sales of the token an unregistered security offering, he noted.</p>



<p>The danger exists because securities laws do not need sales or transfer of an underlying asset to occur for a company to be liable for offering unregistered securities. Deaton added that he expects the SEC&#8217;s oral argument, if one should be conducted, to focus mainly on &#8216;offering.&#8217;</p>



<p><em>&#8220;[This] is the biggest danger to Ripple IMO. Application of the law doesn’t focus only on sales. In fact, a sale or transfer of the underlying asset doesn’t have to occur for a company to be liable. If there’s oral argument, I bet you hear the SEC lawyer focus a lot on the &#8216;offering.'&#8221; </em></p>



<h2 id="h-a-win-for-ripple-is-still-likely-and-is-vital-for-crypto-according-to-deaton"><strong>A win for Ripple is still likely and is vital for crypto, according to Deaton</strong></h2>



<p>Meanwhile, Deaton also argues that an outright win for Ripple, in which the judge criticizes the SEC for pursuing the implausible theory that XRP is a security, is <a href="https://zycrypto.com/optimism-for-groundbreaking-ripple-win-against-sec-fuels-xrp-price-surge-as-whales-load-up-heavily/">still highly possible</a>. This ruling is also the most desired outcome for the crypto industry.</p>



<p>This is because any decision in the case will have a &#8220;huge impact practically and politically speaking.&#8221; A ruling favourable to Ripple would effectively halt the SEC chair Gary Gensler&#8217;s regulation by enforcement campaign against the industry. </p>



<p>A ruling in favour of the SEC&#8217;s argument would arm the regulator to go all out against other crypto firms and projects in the U.S.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the case has entered the final stages following the filing of final motions for summary judgment by both the SEC and Ripple. Both parties and the broader community are awaiting a decision from the judge. It is anticipated that the wait could last a few months. Market participants also expect the price of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-at-3-8-huge-price-milestone-highly-envisioned-if-ripple-wins-sec-case-but-theres-a-catch/">XRP to soar</a> when the case provides clarity for it.</p>

<p>Following the dissolution of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ftx-capitulates-and-agrees-to-sell-to-binance-following-the-liquidity-crunch-that-rocked-the-exchange/">Binance and FTX’s deal</a>, the market has since reacted with even more distrust. Sam Bankman-Fried has been criticized even more, but the CEO of Binance, who was to acquire FTX, has not been spared.</p>



<h2 id="h-cz-makes-a-bigger-revelation-about-sbf-and-the-ftx-controversy"><strong>CZ makes a bigger revelation about SBF and the FTX controversy </strong></h2>



<p>Attempting to set the record straight, CZ, as he’s fondly called, has taken to Twitter to bare it all out.</p>



<p>Tweeting to his 7.9 million followers, CZ said;</p>



<p><em>“SBF perpetuated a narrative painting me and other people as the “bad guys”. It was critical in maintaining the fantasy that he was a “hero.” SBF is one of the greatest fraudsters in history, he is also a master manipulator when it comes to the media and key opinion leaders.”</em></p>



<p>Responding to the many speculations from onlookers, he notes how he’s recently been tagged the saviour of cryptocurrency. To this, he maintains that cryptocurrency needs no saving. He insists that no one crypto proponent is the centre of crypto but only a part of the “beauty of decentralization.” CZ is on a journey to support struggling projects, he adds.</p>



<p>Post-FTX’s crash, many have implied that CZ played a role in the firm’s collapse. CZ insists that the firm‘s fall results from billions of dollars stolen from users&#8217; funds.</p>



<p>The CEO also rejected claims that he tanked FTX’s price after his bearish tweet’s preceded the firm’s crash. Alameda’s CEO, Caroline Ellison, is instead credited for this, as he cited an <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1600083620013768704?s=46&amp;t=bSfOrRcOJn-qcj9YSC-UzA">article</a> from Bloomberg that explains how the FTT crash was primarily influenced by Ellison’s <a href="https://twitter.com/carolinecapital/status/1589287457975304193?s=46&amp;t=bSfOrRcOJn-qcj9YSC-UzA">tweet</a>. “She gave her floor price away,” he stated.</p>



<p>It is clear where CZ stands when it comes to SBF. The billionaire reveals his reputation, along with others linked to the saga, was dragged in the mud.</p>



<p><em>“SBF perpetuated a narrative painting me and other people as the “bad guys”. It was critical in maintaining the fantasy that he was a “hero.” SBF is one of the greatest fraudsters in history, he is also a master manipulator when it comes to media and key opinion leaders.” he explained</em>.</p>



<p>In a conclusive tweet, he had this to say about the comparison between Binance and other leading exchanges in the industry. </p>



<p>He’s quoted saying; </p>



<p>“<em>We don&#8217;t focus on competitors because it&#8217;s a waste of time and resources when the industry has only touched 6% of the population. We want multiple exchanges, multiple blockchains, multiple wallets, etc, to co-exist in the ecosystem.”</em></p>
