			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Digital assets have reminded everybody how rapidly they can move when they want to. Investors underexposed to the market are beginning to shake off their bearish mentality, desperate to enter before it takes off. When questioned about protocols that could skyrocket in 2023, analysts returned three names consistently: Uwerx, Conflux (CXS), and Avalanche (AVAX). This article analyzes these protocols and lays out price predictions for each token in 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uwerx (WERX) Price Prediction Uwerx is a bold disruptor currently at its presale launch that is looking to reshape the entire freelance marketplace industry by launching a decentralized alternative to the Polygon (MATIC) network. Uwerx has opened its presale to fund the creation and deployment of the Uwerx platform, and investors can currently purchase WERX tokens for just $0.00995. SolidProof and InterFi Network have already audited the protocol, and the Uwerx team announced they would lock liquidity for 25 years following the end of the presale. On-chain data shows several seasoned traders going long already. The WERX token will power the entire Uwerx platform, and freelancers will need it to interact with the protocol giving it a significant source of natural demand. This has led analysts to make bullish predictions speculating that the WERX token may trade as high as $3.20 in Q3/Q4 2023. According to Nasdaq, a study released by DaVinci Payments found an estimated increase of 23 million gig workers versus 2019. Analysts pointed out that every single freelancer is a potential user of the Uwerx platform. Conflux (CFX) Price Prediction Conflux (CXS) has been performing well recently, and Conflux (CXS)&nbsp; has been riding the China narrative. The Conflux (CXS) token powers the Conflux (CXS) network, a layer one blockchain protocol that connects communities across borders. Conflux (CXS) currently trades at $0.32, with analysts expecting Conflux (CXS) to trade between $0.26 and $0.35. Conflux (CXS) has already reached the upper limit of analysts&rsquo; predictions, hinting that this token and the China narrative driving its growth still have a good distance to go before the year closes. Avalanche (AVAX) Price Prediction Avalanche (AVAX) went live in 2020, and since then Avalanche (AVAX) has been a thriving ecosystem for DeFi enthusiasts. Avalanche (AVAX), performance-wise, is one of the best Layer one blockchains in the space, offering robust security guarantees and sub-one-second transaction finality. Avalanche (AVAX) hosts a web of dApps and constantly expands its offerings. Avalanche (AVAX) currently trades at $17.21, with analysts expecting Avalanche (AVAX) to trade between $20.03 and $23.23 in 2023. However, several analysts said they believe Avalanche (AVAX) has greater upside potential. Uwerx: A Future Blue Chip?Overarching analysts continued to return to Uwerx when pressed for tokens with the highest growth potential. Given that the token is still in its presale, investors join on the ground level. If adoption levels meet the forecasts made by analysts, WERX could easily go parabolic.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Calgary, Canada, May 3rd, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>Portals, the platform that simplifies Web3 by enabling anyone to bundle complex DeFi actions, has announced the successful close of a $2M seed funding round led by Lightshift Capital, with participation from Poolside, Basement Labs, LongHash Ventures, Daedalus Angels, Mechanism Capital and leading angels 0xMaki, Mathieu Baril, Owl.eth, Emile Dubie, Rudy Kadoch, David Dias, and others.</p>Lightshift Capital, the lead investor, recognized Portals' unique value proposition in the DeFi space and is excited to be part of their journey. According to Sim&atilde;o Cruz, Founding Partner at Lightshift: &ldquo;Portals' emphasis on simplifying DeFi for retail investors is a critical component in driving widespread adoption of this new financial paradigm. With Portals, users no longer need to worry about which type of tokens to hold, which venues to use, or which chains are involved in the transaction. Instead, they can focus solely on the assets they want to use and execute their transactions with ease in just one click.&rdquo;<p>With this funding, Portals is poised to continue disrupting and simplifying the DeFi space, allowing anyone to easily manage complex DeFi activities.</p><p>Portals enables:</p><ul><li>Bundling of complex, multi-step actions, such as swapping interest-bearing, liquidity pool, vault, and other exotic assets in one-click.</li><li>Staking to earn yield from over 20,000 supported opportunities, with new platforms frequently added to the list.</li><li>Access to Web3 data from DeFi protocols, including liquidity pool and token prices, contract positions, account balances, and more through the Portals API.</li></ul><p>The Portals API is built by Web3 natives who understand the challenges and complexity this technology can bring for new developers. Therefore the experienced team of Portals has focused on making the integration as seamless as possible for any level of developer. In addition Lightshift has contributed its engineering teams to build an API integration boilerplate that anyone can use to bootstrap their integration. This ensures that developers have the tools they need to integrate Portals seamlessly into their products, while retail users can enjoy hassle-free access to a vast range of DeFi opportunities.</p>"We're thrilled to have the support of Lightshift and our other investors as we continue to enhance performance, boost functionality, and drive DeFi adoption," said Nabi Ozberkman, co-founder and CTO of Portals. "Our team has the skills, experience, and network to create one of the top solutions in the market."<p>Portals was recently selected to be a part of Poolside Accelerator's inaugural cohort, receiving $100,000 in funding and mentorship in areas like marketing, token economy, go-to-market and business development strategy. The program began mid-April. In early June, Portals will present its product during the Poolside Demo Day to a select group of investors.</p><p>Portals was founded by Suhail Gangji, who previously co-founded Zapper, and Nabi Ozberkman, who has extensive experience in DeFi as part of the OlympusDAO team. The company plans to use the funding to accelerate product development and expand the team, as they continue to simplify DeFi and make it accessible to everyone.</p>"We see great potential in Suhail as a strong founder, coming from Zapper, with an ability to ship fast. Portals is offering the most comprehensive swaps between exotic tokens like LP shares and interest bearing assets, something that is valuable to any DeFi market participant. Portals will be an instrumental tool as DeFi adoption continues and experiences another major upturn,&rdquo; said Brian Fakhoury, Partner at Mechanism Capital.<p>About Portals</p><p>Portals is a platform that simplifies Web3 by enabling anyone to easily bundle complex DeFi actions.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In recent crypto news, investors are speculating about the future Cosmos (ATOM) price, while Shiba Inu (SHIB) shows signs of increased gains for its holders. However, Collateral Network (COLT), currently in its public presale, has experienced unprecedented growth in demand, forecasted to deliver 3500% gains in the upcoming months.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s8">Collateral Network (COLT)</p>
<p>It took Collateral Network only a few weeks to climb the crypto charts. With a growing and supportive community that shares its vision, Collateral Network (COLT) has been an unstoppable force.</p>
<p>Collateral Network is set to transform the crowdlending industry with its innovative peer-to-peer decentralized lending protocol that allows people to put up real-world assets as collateral and unlock liquidity.</p>
<p class="s9">Borrowers send their watches, cars, and other high-value assets to the Collateral Network, where the Collateral Network team uses AI to evaluate the asset and generate a fair price. Collateral Network mints an NFT against the asset and stores it in its highly-secure vault.</p>
<p>Next, Collateral Network further fractionalizes the 100% asset-backed NFT to enable multiple lenders to fund the loan with smaller amounts and receive fixed interest payments. The Collateral Network team calls this fractionalized lending.</p>
<p class="s10">Below are the top reason why crypto experts are buying the COLT presale token:</p>
● It is not a pump &amp; dump project with no real value but a blockchain-powered revolution that will change the lending market.
● The asset backed lending market is worth trillions which is why COLT buyers can expect at least 35x ROI in 2023.
● Unlike other presale tokens, Collateral Network has a Doxxed front-facing team ready to push Collateral Network into a future blue-chip crypto.
● Being a pioneer in this field gives Collateral Network (COLT) a massive advantage and popularity.
● By investing in Collateral Network (COLT), you get to tap into a fresh and enthusiastic community too which is growing every second on social media and all over the web.
● Collateral Network has been all over the news amplifying its popularity and presale demand.
● Collateral Network has passed through an audit by InterFi Network, and &nbsp;KYC with SolidProof.
<p>Currently, Collateral Network is in its public presale, with the Collateral Network (COLT) token trading at $0.014. Additionally, as its recent 40% price surge causes an exponential rise in demand, investors are swarming the project&rsquo;s presale, with experts predicting a 3500% growth potential in upcoming months.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="s8">Cosmos (ATOM)</p>
<p>After the rocky start that Cosmos had in the first quarter of 2023, things are looking up for Cosmos holders. Following the announcements of several new Cosmos developments and partnerships, the Cosmos (ATOM) token experienced a 147% trading volume surge, elevating the price above the $11 level. Moreover, this marks the highest price point of the Cosmos token in recent months.</p>
<p>Currently, the Cosmos (ATOM) token trades at $11.72, marking a 1.66% increase in the last 24 hours. Additionally, the Cosmos market cap increased by 1.66% over the past 23-hour period.</p>
<p>Experts believe that the Cosmos token will continue getting support, predicting that the Cosmos bullish movement is strong enough to break the bearish cap at $13.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s8">Shiba Inu (SHIB)</p>
<p>As Shiba Inu continues its rivalry with Dogecoin (DOGE) and other meme coins, Shiba Inuholders are determined to bring it to the forefront of the race. Shiba Inu has grown its community significantly since its launch in 2020, creating a following that genuinely believes in the potential of the Shiba Inu token.</p>
<p>The Shiba Inu (SHIB) token is currently trading at $0.00001026, with a 0.02% increase in price in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>And, despite its highly volatile performance, the Shiba Inu token has had impressive growth in 2023, experiencing a 27,13% increase in the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price thus far.</p>

<p class="s16">By buying during the presale, you can get the token before it is released to the public. The first phase of the presale starts at $0.014 per COLT token, and a 40% bonus offer is available for a limited time. Act fast as the price is set to increase this week.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s5">As cryptocurrencies progress, more stakeholders are en masse. Emerging players are developing creative approaches to acquire traction and attract new customers. Players already in the game want to reach a wider audience. Let's discuss the current prices of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Quant (QNT) and how a new competitor, Sparklo (SPRK), is gaining more volume in its presale stage. </p>
<p class="s5">Bitcoin Cash (BCH): Cash Or Crash As Coin Price Drops </p>
<p class="s5">Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a permissionless decentralized currency, and as such, it doesn't need a central bank or trusted third parties to run transactions. Bitcoin Cash (BCH), in contrast to traditional fiat money, doesn't rely on monetary intermediaries like banks and payment processors. Governments or other centralized organizations cannot censor transactions on Bitcoin Cash (BCH).</p>
<p class="s5">Bitcoin Cash (BCH) aims to scale blockchain technology to provide fast payment, high transaction capacity, and user privacy. Similar to how money cannot be frozen or taken, the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network is not under the jurisdiction of any financial institution.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY SPARKLO TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s5">Is Quant (QNT) Going Down To $40?</p>
<p class="s5">Quant (QNT), which debuted in June 2018, aimed to connect networks and blockchains worldwide while upholding the network's efficiency and compatibility. Developing the first blockchain operating system is the first initiative to address the interoperability issue.</p>
<p class="s5">Quant's (QNT) primary goal in adopting Overledger is to close the gap between various blockchains. Quant (QNT) describes Overledger as the ecosystem on which the future ecosystem of the digital economy would be created, and it also serves as the project's mainframe.</p>
<p class="s5">The price of Quant (QNT) has been on a steady decline since it was announced that Quant (QNT) is no longer a member of the Digital Pound Foundation, which means Quant (QNT) will not be used for CBDCs. This news caused considerable speculation among traders and investors who are worried about the bearish consequence that it will have on the token.</p>
<p class="s5">Before the news, Quant's (QNT) price dropped sharply from $123 to $112.3 in just 4 hours. This sudden drop created a chain reaction, repeatedly causing the coin to test the $106 support. A break of that support zone may see the price plummet to as low as $70.</p>
<p class="s5">Sparklo (SPRK) Shines A New Light Of Hope On Investors</p>
<p class="s5">Sparklo, although still in its presale stage, continues to gather traction as investors keep flocking to the relatively new token. Sparklo is the world's first precious metals trading platform that will be built on the blockchain. It aims to bring revolutionary features to break the barrier between traditional metal investing platforms and retail investors. </p>
<p class="s5">Interfi Network audited the team and has locked its liquidity for 100 years, making it entirely safe for investors. It is crucial to get in early to get the most out of a potential blue-chip project such as this. </p>
<p class="s5">Sparklo is presently in its first presale stage, and a token is selling for just 0.017 with a 30% bonus on all buys (This bonus offer will expire on May 5)</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="s5">As cryptocurrencies progress, more stakeholders are en masse. Emerging players are developing creative approaches to acquire traction and attract new customers. Players already in the game want to reach a wider audience. Let's discuss the current prices of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Quant (QNT) and how a new competitor, Sparklo (SPRK), is gaining more volume in its presale stage. </p>
<p class="s5">Bitcoin Cash (BCH): Cash Or Crash As Coin Price Drops </p>
<p class="s5">Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a permissionless decentralized currency, and as such, it doesn't need a central bank or trusted third parties to run transactions. Bitcoin Cash (BCH), in contrast to traditional fiat money, doesn't rely on monetary intermediaries like banks and payment processors. Governments or other centralized organizations cannot censor transactions on Bitcoin Cash (BCH).</p>
<p class="s5">Bitcoin Cash (BCH) aims to scale blockchain technology to provide fast payment, high transaction capacity, and user privacy. Similar to how money cannot be frozen or taken, the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network is not under the jurisdiction of any financial institution.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s3">In the crypto industry, trends are constantly popping up, trying to steal the spotlight with their distinct use cases and expanding possibilities. Currently, many popular cryptocurrencies like Binance Coin (BNB) and Bitcoin (BTC), have encountered difficulties. As a result of this bad trend, investors are looking for fresh ventures with high prospective returns.</p>
<p class="s3">Sparklo is one of these cutting-edge technologies that has caught the curiosity of the cryptocurrency community. It plans to steal and hold the spotlight with its unique investment platform and its benefits.</p>
<p class="s3">Danger Looms for Binance Coin (BNB)</p>
<p class="s3">Recent reports show that Binance Coin (BNB) may face yet another FUD as open interest on Binance's short side continues to grow substantially. Strangely, this increase in short orders is taking place in the absence of any significant Binance or BNB news or updates, suggesting that the current price movement is not supported by solid fundamentals.</p>
<p class="s3">This situation is analogous to the spike in the short volume of Binance Coin (BNB) during March. Hedging techniques against the most recent EDU launchpad mishap might be one cause for the spike in short interest.</p>
<p class="s3">The Open Campus (EDU) subscription term is about to expire, according to a recent announcement made by Binance Coin (BNB). Investors may be using shorting Binance Coin (BNB) as a hedging tactic as they attempt to safeguard their investments and lessen any risks connected to the EDU launchpad event. This might account for the unexpected increase of short orders on the Binance platform, despite the lack of any unfavourable information or events affecting Binance Coin (BNB) or the exchange.</p>
<p class="s3">Though it is difficult to predict exactly how this rise in short interest will affect Binance Coin (BNB), it is important to closely monitor the market and any relevant news that might affect investor sentiment.</p>
<p class="s3">Bitcoin (BTC)'s Unexpected Volatility Destroys $1 Billion in Open Interest</p>
<p class="s3">The crypto market saw a huge change on April 26, 2023. Trading positions both long and short were impacted during this period as the market leader Bitcoin (BTC) declined by almost $3,000 in less than three hours.</p>
<p class="s3">According to TradingView data, this unanticipated volatility broadened the Bitcoin (BTC) market, wiping out up to $1 billion in open interest and liquidated futures contracts worth up to $175 million in only one day.</p>
<p class="s3">Market volatility causes abrupt increases that harm long-term investments. Exchanges and trading platforms occasionally quickly cancel open deals with partially or entirely exhausted margins.</p>
<p class="s3">Bitcoin (BTC)'s recent market volatility shot up in both directions. The sudden price drop forced several long positions to be closed. Bitcoin (BTC) rebounded when sell-limit orders were activated, but they later spiked high and were liquidated. The only transactions that were able to endure this sudden volatility of Bitcoin (BTC) were those with high-margin requirements and lengthy risk exposures.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY SPARKLO TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s3">Sparklo (SPRK) in The Spotlight of The Crypto Industry</p>
<p class="s3">Sparklo intends to revolutionize precious metals investing by developing a blockchain-based marketplace for acquiring NFTs that reflect gold, silver, and platinum bars. On Sparklo's cutting-edge platform, investors will be able to purchase fractionalized shares of these precious metals, making them more cost-effective and widely accessible.</p>
<p class="s3">The team's successful auditing and KYC verification can reassure purchasers or investors of Sparklo (SPRK) tokens. The smart contract also plans to lock away liquidity for 100 days.</p>
<p class="s3">The Sparklo pre-sale is still ongoing. This will require 60% of the 1,000,000,000 Sparklo tokens that are being issued. Purchasers will get a 30% bonus on any transaction with a current value of just $0.015. Note that by the end of April, one Sparklo (SPRK) token will cost $0.017.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The NEAR Protocol has partnered with Shemaroo Entertainment to promote Web3 adoption in the Indian media and entertainment market.&nbsp;</p>
NEAR x Shemaroo Comes To India
<p>Shemaroo Entertainment Limited, one of India's leading media conglomerates, has joined hands with the NEAR Foundation to promote the adoption of Web3 technology in the Indian media and entertainment industry. The two organizations have signed a strategic partnership agreement to leverage the benefits of blockchain technology for content distribution and monetization.</p>
<p>According to the official announcement made by the NEAR Foundation, the partnership will focus on building decentralized applications (dApps) that utilize blockchain technology to enable content creators to reach a wider audience while ensuring the security and transparency of transactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The partnership will also explore the use of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to create unique digital assets for Shemaroo's vast library of content.</p>
Shemaroo Books Another Web3 Deal
<p>The NEAR Foundation's partnership with Shemaroo is expected to significantly boost the adoption of Web3 technology in the Indian media and entertainment industry, which is rapidly expanding due to the increasing popularity of online streaming platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will also make content distribution more efficient, transparent, and secure while providing content creators with new opportunities to monetize their work.</p>
<p>Speaking about the partnership, Hiren Gada, CEO of Shemaroo Entertainment Limited, expressed his excitement over the partnership that will help the company leverage the benefits of blockchain technology.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Gada, blockchain technology will introduce new scopes and use cases to revolutionize how content is distributed and consumed in the country.&nbsp;</p>
NEAR Eager For Indian Market
<p>The NEAR Foundation is also optimistic about the partnership's potential to capture the Indian market and establish its expansion in a relatively unsaturated market. With over 100 million views per day and a sizeable subscriber base of over 200 million, Shemaroo boasts an impressive audience that will be exposed to NEAR&rsquo;s Web3 efforts through this partnership.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it will also boost the adoption of NEAR&rsquo;s blockchain operating system (BOS) by attracting new developers and partners in the country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marieke Flament, CEO of the NEAR Foundation, shared her excitement about the partnership, saying,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are thrilled to partner with Shemaroo Entertainment, a company with a rich history in Indian cinema and a vast market reach.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Mahe, Seychelles, May 3rd, 2023, Chainwire</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Former executives from Ankr and Blockdaemon have joined their expertise to create Tenet, the first Layer 1 blockchain built to create a hub for Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs). Tenet is emerging from stealth mode and unveiling its Testnet today, enabling developers to interact and experiment with the platform.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Tenet is an EVM-compatible L1 protocol, designed to bring additional liquidity and yield opportunities to LSDs by allowing users to re-stake their assets on Tenet's network and participate in Tenet's DeFi ecosystem. Unlike other Cosmos chains that rely on their own native token for Proof of Stake security, Tenet validators can make use of a unique mechanism called Diversified Proof of Stake (DiPoS).&nbsp;</p><p class="ql-align-justify">In a nutshell, DiPoS allows validating the Tenet network by re-staking the LSDs from other L1 ecosystems supported by Tenet, such as ETH, BNB, ATOM, SOL and Matic. This ensures the long-term security of the Tenet chain by leveraging the joint security of each L1 ecosystem it services. The lack of shared security has been long-recognized as an adoption roadblock for many chains in the ecosystem.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">The LSDs re-staked to the Tenet network will be usable like other LSDs (or, an LLSD) to take advantage of DeFi opportunities on Tenet. In addition to DEXs and lending pools, they will also be able to mint the Universal Stablecoin interest free, allowing them to receive an &ldquo;advance&rdquo; on their future LSD yields, which became the largest market vertical in Defi this year, surpassing DEX's with $17.5B in TVL.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Tenet also offers the first L1 ecosystem with native gauges, which allow veTenet token holders to direct rewards to the pools they choose. Oftentimes, projects will offer &ldquo;bribes&rdquo; to direct rewards to their tokens, increasing the utility of veTenet.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">The Tenet product vision is aimed at simplifying the staking experience for users. One of the pillars of this vision is the Eva mobile wallet, a retail friendly mobile app that uses an AI chat-bot to educate users about DeFi and automates interactions with the Tenet chain through optimized yield strategies.&nbsp;</p><p class="ql-align-justify">The project is co-founded by Greg Gopman, previously CMO at major LSD protocol Ankr, and Dan Peterson, formerly the Revenue Operations Specialist at Blockdaemon, the largest independant infrastructure and staking firm in crypto, valued at +$3B. Four more experienced core members round out technical and BD expertise, while advisors from Lido, Ankr and OpenAI will offer invaluable support to expand and grow the protocol.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Greg Gopman, co-founder of Tenet, said, "At Ankr, we helped bring Liquid Staking Tokens to eight Blockchains and built out some of the best LSD infrastructure in the industry, but no one used it. Tenet was really a golden opportunity for being first to market in utilizing best in class technology with almost $20B in untapped liquidity.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">"We analyzed what other projects like Berachain and Eigen Layer were doing and realized that there was a better way to position ourselves to best address the market," added Dan Peterson, co-founder of Tenet. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve chosen to take a user-centric path, making the staking and LSD experience simpler and more secure for the average user.&rdquo;</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Tenet is inviting DeFi protocols and developers interested in taking advantage of LSD liquidity to sign up for the Testnet and familiarize themselves with the platform. In the coming months, Tenet plans to roll out a grants program and a global DeFi hackathon series to engage developers worldwide, while preparing for the fair community launch of the Tenet blockchain.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">About Tenet</p><p>Tenet is a DeFi-focused Layer-1 ecosystem built on the Cosmos network, providing liquidity and yield opportunities for liquid staking derivatives (LSDs). Co-founded by Greg Gopman, former CMO of Ankr, and Dan Peterson, former Revenue Operations at Blockdaemon, Tenet aims to unlock the potential of the rapidly growing LSD market, which is currently valued at over $17 billion. Tenet takes a unique approach by sharing security through Diversified Proof of Stake, while using L1-native gauges to let users earn yield on their liquid staking assets and participate in the platform's governance.

The lack of shared security has been long-recognized as an adoption roadblock for many chains in the ecosystem.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">The LSDs re-staked to the Tenet network will be usable like other LSDs (or, an LLSD) to take advantage of DeFi opportunities on Tenet. In addition to DEXs and lending pools, they will also be able to mint the Universal Stablecoin interest free, allowing them to receive an &ldquo;advance&rdquo; on their future LSD yields, which became the largest market vertical in Defi this year, surpassing DEX's with $17.5B in TVL.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Tenet also offers the first L1 ecosystem with native gauges, which allow veTenet token holders to direct rewards to the pools they choose. Oftentimes, projects will offer &ldquo;bribes&rdquo; to direct rewards to their tokens, increasing the utility of veTenet.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">The Tenet product vision is aimed at simplifying the staking experience for users. One of the pillars of this vision is the Eva mobile wallet, a retail friendly mobile app that uses an AI chat-bot to educate users about DeFi and automates interactions with the Tenet chain through optimized yield strategies.&nbsp;</p><p class="ql-align-justify">The project is co-founded by Greg Gopman, previously CMO at major LSD protocol Ankr, and Dan Peterson, formerly the Revenue Operations Specialist at Blockdaemon, the largest independant infrastructure and staking firm in crypto, valued at +$3B. Four more experienced core members round out technical and BD expertise, while advisors from Lido, Ankr and OpenAI will offer invaluable support to expand and grow the protocol.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Greg Gopman, co-founder of Tenet, said, "At Ankr, we helped bring Liquid Staking Tokens to eight Blockchains and built out some of the best LSD infrastructure in the industry, but no one used it. Tenet was really a golden opportunity for being first to market in utilizing best in class technology with almost $20B in untapped liquidity.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">"We analyzed what other projects like Berachain and Eigen Layer were doing and realized that there was a better way to position ourselves to best address the market," added Dan Peterson, co-founder of Tenet. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve chosen to take a user-centric path, making the staking and LSD experience simpler and more secure for the average user.&rdquo;</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Tenet is inviting DeFi protocols and developers interested in taking advantage of LSD liquidity to sign up for the Testnet and familiarize themselves with the platform. In the coming months, Tenet plans to roll out a grants program and a global DeFi hackathon series to engage developers worldwide, while preparing for the fair community launch of the Tenet blockchain.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">About Tenet</p><p>Tenet is a DeFi-focused Layer-1 ecosystem built on the Cosmos network, providing liquidity and yield opportunities for liquid staking derivatives (LSDs). Co-founded by Greg Gopman, former CMO of Ankr, and Dan Peterson, former Revenue Operations at Blockdaemon, Tenet aims to unlock the potential of the rapidly growing LSD market, which is currently valued at over $17 billion. Tenet takes a unique approach by sharing security through Diversified Proof of Stake, while using L1-native gauges to let users earn yield on their liquid staking assets and participate in the platform's governance.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The U.K. is fast emerging as one of the world&rsquo;s leading crypto hubs, owing to a combination of its thriving startup ecosystem, strong financial infrastructure, and solid support from policymakers.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The momentum around the U.K.&rsquo;s crypto scene is growing rapidly. In a recent study by Recap, London was singled out as one of the world&rsquo;s best cities for doing business in crypto. Recap&rsquo;s conclusion was based on eight key data points that all pointed to London as being one of the most enticing locations for crypto startups and businesses. </p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As Recap notes, the widespread adoption of crypto is predicated on a number of conditions, including friendly regulations and a proper infrastructure to build on. London has both, and together they ensure easy access to the crypto ecosystem for public funding. Recap&rsquo;s research also found that London scored highly in other key metrics, such as taxes, jobs, ATMs, and crypto events, coming in ahead of other cities that are perceived as being crypto-friendly, such as Dubai, Paris, New York, Hong Kong, which was previously ranked number one but has since dropped to seventh place. </p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">London&rsquo;s claim to be one of the best cities for crypto startups will likely please the U.K.&rsquo;s new Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who last year spelled out a vision that will ensure the country&rsquo;s financial services industry &ldquo;is always at the forefront of technology and innovation&rdquo;. While Sunak hasn&rsquo;t had an awful lot of time to build on that vision, he&rsquo;s certainly on track to fulfill it. </p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The U.K. government under Sunak has made a number of encouraging moves that should further bolster the country&rsquo;s reputation as the place to do crypto business. Last year for instance, the Bank of England and the U.K.&rsquo;s Treasury issued a joint statement that underscored the need for a &ldquo;central bank digital currency&rdquo;, or CBDC, to launch by 2030 at the latest. </p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">More recently, the U.K.&rsquo;s Financial Conduct Authority - one of its leading financial regulators - demonstrated its willingness to embrace crypto technology. The word came straight from the horse&rsquo;s mouth when FCA Executive Director Sarah Pritchard spoke during London&rsquo;s City Week conference to emphasize the need for collaboration with crypto industry participants in order to create regulations that won&rsquo;t suffocate innovation.&nbsp; </p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;We want industry&rsquo;s input to make sure we get the future regulatory regime for crypto assets right,&rdquo; Pritchard said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s work together, to shape our rules and regulations to benefit markets, consumers, and firms as crypto goes from niche to mainstream.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">That same month, further positivity around the U.K.&rsquo;s crypto scene arose from the Treasury department, which announced that it&rsquo;s reviving its plan to create an Asset Management Taskforce. One of its key roles will be to develop crypto regulations alongside the private sector, Sky News reported.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Focus On The Metaverse
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Aside from introducing a suitable regulatory climate to foster crypto ecosystem growth, the U.K. also has ambitions to become a leader in areas such as Web3 and the metaverse. </p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A report from CoinDesk in March focused on the U.K.&rsquo;s 2023 Spring Budget, which mentioned how the government is plotting to &ldquo;lead on the future of web technology, sometimes known as Web3 or the metaverse&rdquo;. According to that report, the newly established Department of Science, Innovation, and Technology will spearhead these efforts, looking at the prospects for economic growth opportunities, business models, and investment associated with the metaverse and Web3. </p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The metaverse in particular has lots of potential for growth. It has emerged as one of the biggest buzzwords in tech alongside artificial intelligence, with Citigroup recently declaring it to be a $13 trillion opportunity. That explains why Facebook&rsquo;s parent company Meta Platforms has dove headlong into the sector, investing billions of dollars into metaverse and virtual reality research. </p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The U.K. is home to a thriving metaverse startup community already. Last November, Remagine Ventures mapped out the country&rsquo;s entire metaverse landscape, highlighting no less than 89 startups in the space. Some of its most notable metaverse startups include Improbable, a simulation engine company that&rsquo;s working with Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT creator Yuga Labs to build a metaverse called Otherside. Others include Blippar, an augmented reality creation startup; Framestore, one of the world&rsquo;s leading VR and visual effects studios; Condense Reality, a Bristol-based startup that helps to livestream metaverse events; and LandVault, a metaverse real estate startup helping brands to create virtual experiences. </p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Moreover, some of the industry&rsquo;s most established metaverse companies are flocking to the U.K. too. For instance, Upland, a virtual property trading game built on the EOS blockchain that&rsquo;s mapped to the real world, recently expanded to incorporate digital replicas of London and Birmingham within its virtual domain. One of Upland&rsquo;s aims is to create a parallel digital economy where players can generate real-world value through digital property ownership and commerce. It&rsquo;s one of the biggest metaverses around, notable for partnering with FIFA to sponsor the Qatar 2022 World Cup. With millions of users, its entry into the U.K. will only help to generate further buzz in a country that&rsquo;s deadly serious about metaverse growth.</p>

Rapid Growth To Foster Further Innovation
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With its overwhelmingly positive attitude to crypto, the U.K. can now boast the world&rsquo;s fastest-growing crypto industry, according to a report by CoinShares. It said the U.K.&rsquo;s crypto industry had grown by an incredible 450% in the last two years, putting its streets ahead of the U.S., with growth of just 120% over the same period, and Switzerland (80%). </p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Besides factors such as the country&rsquo;s highly developed financial services sector and friendly regulations, CoinShares also cited access to funding and the U.K.&rsquo;s highly skilled workforce as reasons for this growth. It has emerged as a highly attractive location for both crypto startups and blockchain professionals. In addition, the U.K. is home to more than three million crypto users who own a combined $3.72 billion worth of digital assets, according to some estimates. </p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The U.K.&rsquo;s crypto economy continues to grow at break-neck speed in spite of the usual challenges that threaten the sector. In addition to the uncertainty over pending regulations, there remain concerns over the environmental impact of some cryptocurrencies. Because mining digital assets such as Bitcoin requires extensive energy, there is a danger that environmental groups will oppose the expansion of the country&rsquo;s crypto sector. </p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, it&rsquo;s likely that most crypto companies will be able to counter these challenges by adopting more energy-efficient mining methods and through investment in renewable energy sources. Assuming the industry is able to overcome these concerns and work with the U.K. government to develop friendly regulations that enable innovation to continue unabated, it&rsquo;s likely that there will be no stopping its crypto economy growth in the years to come. As the industry grows, more businesses and individuals will come to recognize the benefits of crypto as a legitimate asset class, fueling demand and further accelerating innovation.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Dubai-based Bybit has become the latest exchange to offer a cryptocurrency lending service. </p>
<p>Cryptocurrency exchange Bybit has launched an in-house cryptocurrency lending service for its users: Bybit Lending. The Dubai-based company said on May 2 the service would deliver interest payouts to users that deposit crypto via the platform&rsquo;s new service.</p>

<p>Borrowers on Bybit&rsquo;s exchange can take out loans to use on the platform&rsquo;s many trading options. Borrowers must post greater than or equal amounts to their loan to ensure lenders&rsquo; capital is safe.</p>

<p>"Borrowers can utilize loans for multiple earning strategies, such as trading Bybit&rsquo;s perpetual contracts or capturing a spread using Bybit Earn. All borrowers will post collateral greater than/equal to the loan amount to ensure the safety of lenders&rsquo; capital."</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy believes that the &ldquo;war on crypto&rdquo; could have led to the recent bank failures.</p>
War on crypto
<p>Robert F. Kennedy, nephew of the assassinated president's brother, is an environmental lawyer, a 2024 candidate for the US presidency, and more importantly, is a proponent of cryptocurrency among other polemic topics in American society.</p>
<p>Kennedy recently tweeted that the FDIC and SEC war on crypto could likely have been the cause of the SVB, Signature, and Silvergate bank failures, citing an Ellen Brown blog report.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The Fed just announced it will introduce its &ldquo;FedNow&rdquo; Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) in July. CBDCs grease the slippery slope to financial slavery and political tyranny.While cash transactions are anonymous, a #CBDC will allow the government to surveil all our private&hellip;</p>
&mdash; Robert F. Kennedy Jr (@RobertKennedyJr) April 5, 2023
<p>

</p>
A fringe candidate?
<p>For someone who could potentially win the US presidency to make such a comment is momentous to say the least. Given this seeming war on crypto it may be likely that Kennedy receives so much negativity in the mainstream press, as well as on social media, that his chances of succeeding to the presidency may dwindle to zero.</p>
<p>Kennedy isn&rsquo;t just vocal about cryptocurrency. He is quoted by Wikipedia as &ldquo;promoting anti-vaccine propaganda&rdquo;, and other &ldquo;health-related conspiracy theories&rdquo;. It appears that he is very willing to take on the gargantuan might of the pharmaceutical industry as well as the government that defends it.</p>
Against CBDCs
<p>Another favourite target for Kennedy is the US exploration of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), which could be imposed on US citizenry in the near future, or perhaps if the banking system starts to fail systemically.</p>
<p>Kennedy recently described CBDCs as being a tool for &ldquo;financial slavery&rdquo; and &ldquo;political tyranny&rdquo;, saying that they could be used to &ldquo;freeze your assets or limit your spending&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In order for Kennedy to have any success in the 2024 presidential campaign, he would need to defeat all other democratic candidates, the likelihood of which is fairly unlikely considering what some might refer to as&nbsp;a government-compliant mainstream media.</p>
<p>However, while he is still able to wield some influence, those who espouse the hugely innovative technology in the cryptocurrency sector might indeed be thankful.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Cryptocurrency exchange bitFlyer USA has been fined $1.2 million by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).&nbsp;</p>
Regulatory Action Against BitFlyer USA
<p>According to the financial regulator, the bitFlyer USA cryptocurrency exchange failed to meet the state&rsquo;s cybersecurity requirements, despite having the necessary license to operate its services in New York.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the time of the Examinations, bitFlyer USA had not performed periodic assessments of its internal and external cybersecurity risks and threats. Instead, the Company relied upon an IT audit performed by bitFlyer (Japan). Although an IT audit ensures the existence of policies and procedures to protect an organization&rsquo;s networks and computer systems, it does not provide visibility into the organization&rsquo;s security risks or how the organization can mitigate those risks and, therefore, is not an acceptable substitute for a comprehensive risk assessment. bitFlyer USA&rsquo;s incomplete approach to risk assessment is at odds with the requirements of the Cybersecurity Regulation that rely on informed decision-making pursuant to the risk assessment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, the financial regulator has acknowledged the crypto exchange&rsquo;s efforts to step up its cybersecurity compliance. BitFlyer has proposed a remediation plan to the regulator that will help it become compliant with the state&rsquo;s cybersecurity laws by the end of the year.&nbsp;</p>
Previous NYDFS Action&nbsp;
<p>BitFlyer joins a long list of crypto companies and exchanges that have faced action from the New York State Department of Financial Services for several violations. Back in January, Coinbase had to pay a $50 million fine to settle charges that it allowed users to open accounts on the platform without conducting sufficient or satisfactory background checks as mandated by Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations. In 2022, Robinhood&rsquo;s crypto division had to pay a $30 million fine for violations related to cybersecurity and anti-money laundering.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In February, the NYDFS launched an investigation into stablecoin issuer Paxos. While the scope of the investigation against Paxos was not disclosed, it was suspected that it was related to the financial regulator&rsquo;s efforts to regulate the stablecoin ecosystem after the spectacular collapse of the Terra ecosystem. Adrienne Harris, the NYDFS Superintendent, stated that the regulator was working on drafting and establishing regulatory guidelines for asset-backed stablecoins even before the Terra collapse. Paxos has claimed on its website that cash reserves and US Treasuries back the stablecoins it issues.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Gemini has officially announced the launch of the Gemini Foundation, the highly anticipated offshore crypto derivatives platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new exchange has been launched in 30 countries. However, it is not available to users in the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and the European Union.&nbsp;</p>
Highly Anticipated Offshore Derivatives Platform Goes Live&nbsp;
<p>The launch of the offshore crypto derivatives trading platform comes just weeks after it was first announced in April. According to Gemini, the offshore derivatives platform Gemini Foundation will allow users to begin trading with Bitcoin (BTC) perpetual contracts. These will be denominated in Gemini Dollars (GUSD) and will offer users 100x leverage. Gemini stated in its blog post,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gemini Foundation &mdash; a non-US derivatives platform &mdash; is now live and open for trading to customers in all available jurisdictions. Start trading the BTC perpetual contract denominated in Gemini dollars (GUSD) with up to 100x leverage today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exchange also stressed that Gemini Foundation would not be available to users based in the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and the European Union. However, the crypto derivatives platform is available in several other jurisdictions, 30 to be exact. These include Hong Kong, Singapore, Argentina, Bahamas, Bermuda, India, Bhutan, British Virgin Islands (BVI), Cayman Islands, Chile, Brazil, El Salvador, Guernsey, Egypt, Jersey, Israel, Nigeria, New Zealand, Peru, Panama, Philippines, Saint Vincent &amp; Grenadine, Saint Lucia, South Africa, Switzerland, Turkey, Thailand, Uruguay, and Vietnam.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gemini has also stated there are plans to launch an ETH/GUSD perpetual contract in the next few weeks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gemini Foundation offers customers a capital-efficient, highly available, and trusted venue to trade derivatives. Purpose-built for both individuals and institutions, Gemini Foundation, combines powerful trading tools with an elegant user experience. In the coming months, we will be expanding our derivatives offering with additional perpetual contracts, dated futures, and options trading.&rdquo;</p>

New Platform Based In Singapore&nbsp;
<p>According to one report, the new Gemini&rsquo;s offshore derivative platform is based in Singapore and there are plans to introduce spot products as well. To fund their trading accounts on the platform customers will be required to convert their USD into GUSD and USD Coin in a 1:1 basis. However, perpetual funding payments will have to be made exclusively in GUSD. The news of the platform&rsquo;s launch comes on the same day Coinbase announced the launch of its own crypto derivatives exchange, the Coinbase International Exchange, based out of Bermuda.&nbsp;</p>
Regulatory Issues Driving Exchanges Out&nbsp;
<p>Cryptocurrency exchanges based in the United States of America have increasingly started moving abroad thanks to growing regulatory uncertainty and an increasingly hostile attitude from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC has ramped up its scrutiny of the crypto space and recently filed regulatory actions on Beaxy and Bittrex. The SEC also brought charges against Gemini for its now-defunct Earn program.&nbsp;</p>
An Update On Earn&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>Gemini provided users with an update on the status of its Earn program, stating that it had agreed to a 30-day mediation process to iron out a final resolution with Genesis, the Digital Currency Group (DCG), the Creditor Committee, and the Unsecured Creditors Committee (UCC). Gemini added that it was supportive of mediation between all parties and would work with everyone involved to bring the matter to an acceptable resolution. However, there have been times when Gemini has expressed its frustrations with the slow pace of progress. Gemini stated on its Twitter account,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Earn update: This past week, Genesis, Digital Currency Group (DCG), the Unsecured Creditors Committee (UCC), the Creditor Committee, and Gemini agreed to start a 30-day mediation process to drive to a final resolution as soon as possible. Gemini is supportive of mediation and working with the parties to bring this to a conclusion.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Bhutan's mountainous terrain, coupled with abundant hydroelectric power reserves, position it ideally for cryptocurrency mining as the country proposes a new $500 million fund targeted toward crypto mining.</p>
Bhutan's crypto strategy
<p>Bhutan appears to have an interest in investments related to Bitcoin and other digital currencies, perhaps as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although Bhutan already has existing crypto mining activities on home soil -through its new crypto mining initiative- the Bhutan government plans on boosting them considerably by inviting foreign participation as well by providing several incentives such as tax exemptions; reduction in electricity rates; and simplified regulations designed specifically for the crypto mining.</p>
<p>Ujjwal Deep Dahal, CEO of Druk Holding and Investments, the Bhutan government&rsquo;s investment arm, said of Bhutan&rsquo;s latest mining venture:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s important for us to look at assets that are low volume, high value, or digital assets for that matter, and try to position ourselves in a way that we can be competitive globally over time to build our economy.&rdquo;</p>

Environmental concerns
<p>Despite being situated ideally for crypto mining activities due to its environment and infrastructure there are concerns toward the environmental impact of such operations given that many people see it as a potential threat to the environment.</p>
<p>However in Bhutan&rsquo;s case the government has expressly stated it will guarantee that all cryptocurrency mining activities take place in an environmentally responsible manner that is consistent with its objective for sustainable development.</p>
CBDC?
<p>While Bhutan is expending time, money, and resources on its crypto strategy, it is also hedging its bets in the traditional financial system by exploring opportunities to create a central bank digital currency (CBDC).</p>
<p>Such initiatives highlight cryptocurrencies' growing attractiveness among developing countries as a vehicle for driving economic prosperity.</p>
<p>However, it must be recognised that implementing conscientious mining practices alongside promoting sustainable development will be a determining factor for Bhutan&rsquo;s mining project to succeed, while at the same time helping communities within Bhutan thrive.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">The TON Foundation, dedicated to the advancement of The Open Network (TON), has partnered with Chainalysis to utilize its Crypto Incident Response Service, ensuring round-the-clock support for swift fund recovery in case of hacks or exploits.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Open Network (TON) Foundation, a non-profit association of developers and enthusiasts, is committed to advancing TON, a technology designed to unite all blockchains and Web2 internet into one open network. Chainalysis is a prime blockchain data platform that provides investigative services and support to both private and public sector organizations. By deploying Chainalysis's rapid response retainer service, TON gains a robust means to combat cyber-attacks or unauthorized network intrusions, which may involve cryptocurrency theft or ransom demands.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Justin Hyun, Head of Incubation at TON Foundation, expressed the organization's insights on enlisting Chainalysis's Crypto Incident Response Service, referring to it as the "industry gold standard" for providing a rapid response to hacks or exploits. Hyun claims that bad actors must be rooted out, and that such a measure is vital to ensuring an optimal experience for TON's growing user base.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"Our vision is to achieve mass adoption in Web3 technology powered by the high performance and scalability that we offer. By rooting out bad actors we can ensure an optimal experience for our growing user base,&rdquo; shares Hyun.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Chainalysis offers a 24/7 hotline for proactive Crypto Incident Response customers, assigning a dedicated team to respond to incidents such as hacks, ransomware attacks, code exploits, or flash loan attacks. The Chainalysis team works tirelessly, leveraging advanced investigative capabilities, to address incidents and, if needed, liaise with law enforcement and asset recovery counsel.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Having worked on hundreds of cases involving cryptocurrency, Chainalysis investigators have helped solve some of the most high-profile cyber-criminal cases. The Chainalysis Crypto Incident Response program streamlines the engagement process, ensuring no time is wasted regardless of the victim's location. Quick tracing and labeling of funds in the Chainalysis platform can be crucial in preventing bad actors from cashing out their ill-gotten gains.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The Open Network (TON) features a layer-1 architecture designed to scale up to 2 to the power of 32 workchains, each of which can be subdivided into up to 2 to the power of 60 shardchains. This design enables TON to support millions of transactions per second near-instantly. By enlisting Chainalysis's Crypto Incident Response Service, the TON Foundation hopes to provide a more secure and reliable environment for its users as it grows.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">To date, Chainalysis data, software, and services have aided law enforcement in the recovery of more than $11 billion in assets. The company has achieved SOC2 Type II Certification for its KYT and Reactor products, which attests to the successful implementation of controls in both the Security and Availability trust service criteria.</p>
