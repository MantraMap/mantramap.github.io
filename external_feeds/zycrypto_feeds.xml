<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially recognized <a href="https://zycrypto.com/blackrocks-renewed-bitcoin-etf-application-featuring-coinbase-raises-questions-on-secs-scrutiny/">BlackRock’s recent spot Bitcoin ETF application</a>. As seen on its official website, the regulatory body acknowledged the ETF filing from BlackRock in a section dedicated to ETFs filed during the third quarter of the year.</p>



<p>Along with BlackRock, the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/secs-approval-of-spot-bitcoin-etfs-wont-be-a-game-changer-for-crypto-industry-jpmorgan-strategists-opine/">SEC</a> also acknowledged other applications sent in by a handful of other leading asset managers. Applications from Fidelity, WisdomTreeFunds, VanEck, Galaxy Digital, Invesco US were also posted on the site.</p>



<p>It is noteworthy that Bitcoin ETF applications filed by leading investment firms like ARK Invest, 21Shares, and Bitwise Invest have already passed this stage.</p>



<p>Key figures in the cryptocurrency market have responded to the recent development. Market players have collectively shared positive sentiments regarding the update on the SEC’s website.</p>



<p>James Seyffrat, a research analyst covering Crypto and Bitcoin relation stories for Bloomberg, seems to think the market is already off to a good start. “We’re off to the races,&#8221; he asserted, adding that Valkyrie Funds’ application is next in line.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">UPDATE: There they are &#8212; SEC just acknowledged the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> ETF applications for <a href="https://twitter.com/BlackRock?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BlackRock</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/vaneck_us?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@vaneck_us</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/InvescoUS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@InvescoUS</a>/<a href="https://twitter.com/GalaxyDigital?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GalaxyDigital</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Fidelity?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Fidelity</a>, &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/WisdomTreeFunds?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@WisdomTreeFunds</a>.

</div></figure>



<p>It bears mentioning that this is only one of many steps required for ETF applications to be recognized by the SEC. However, the steps are not determining factors in the approval process.</p>



<p>As Seyffrat explained; </p>



<p><em>“Gotta expect ValkyrieFunds&#8217;s application to be acknowledged on ~Monday based on recent trends. Also &#8212; as I said yesterday this is just a step in the process and does *NOT* mean these will be approved. Just that the official process has begun.”</em></p>



<p>Meanwhile, anticipation for the approval of a Bitcoin Spot ETF has intensified following news that Europe is preparing to launch its first spot Bitcoin ETF. According to Jacobi Asset Management, the asset manager responsible for the Bitcoin ETF listing, the ETF is set to go live this July.</p>



<p>The asset manager first received approval for its application in 2021 but failed to launch the ETF due to unfavourable market conditions. After 12 months, the asset manager is ready to meet market demands, which it claims have “shifted since last summer”.</p>



<p>On the other hand, spot Bitcoin ETF applications are still pending. Although market players are not certain how long it will take to get a response from the SEC, a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/a-spot-bitcoin-etf-could-turn-around-btcs-fortunes-says-galaxy-digitals-ceo/">prominent figure</a> in the market is convinced that the approval of a Bitcoin Spot ETF could be significantly favourable for Bitcoin’s price.</p>

<p>In a major development, the judge presiding over Ripple&#8217;s case declared that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">XRP does not fall within the definition of a security</a>. According to the judge, Ripple&#8217;s sale of XRP does not constitute an investment contract. This is a win for Ripple. The judge&#8217;s ruling claimed that XRP did not meet the criteria for being a security. This decision also extends to institutional sales of XRP, which are also deemed not to be securities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-xrp-price-almost-doubled"><strong>XRP Price Almost Doubled</strong></h2>



<p>According to <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1679582926110064640">Santiment</a>, a market intelligence platform, XRP price skyrocketed 87% within 3 hours. It currently ranks No. 5 on CoinMarketCap, with an instant market capitalization of $36 billion.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/p1uzE-UtYe-CsODDdzJA3RWHqhfxGTtFSa-fdckszjqoM9vZGvNdB-SLf50wB5XtMqqjKfEj4E4tf5ZjTIryvNHsSl0McOfsPjZkV2yOO9IQctNsILoIRrKHkCfgE0EvGCJ82vH9TpvXqRfWHAvB98w" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Judge Torres, who provided additional context for the ruling, stated that Ripple&#8217;s programmatic sales, distribution channels, and XRP sales by Larsen and Garlinghouse do not form investment contracts. In essence, this interpretation effectively prevents categorising such transactions as securities.</p>



<p>In a broader context, the judge&#8217;s statement has implications for the broader cryptocurrency market. Judge Torres&#8217; ruling specified that the classification of digital tokens sold to the public as securities is not always definitive. This may open the way for cryptocurrency sales and transactions, which is expected to revolutionize the cryptocurrency market.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Only a 50/50 win</strong></h2>



<p>While this ruling has brought <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-makes-a-comeback-as-holders-bet-on-huge-upsurge-amid-ripples-groundbreaking-win-in-sec-lawsuit/">considerable relief to Ripple and XRP enthusiasts</a>, there is more to come, and the verdict is only a 50/50 win, with the court stating that a separate announcement will be issued soon detailing the date of the next hearing and a schedule of any relevant preliminary hearings.</p>



<p>XRP price predictions are all up as $600M in volume keeps XRP above $0.6 – whales are buying; XRP’s charts suggest it may be about to rally again, with its indicators starting to turn up.</p>

<p>As part of its reorganisation strategy, insolvent crypto lending platform Celsius has recently received the green light from the court to swap over its altcoin holdings into Bitcoin and Ethereum. The move comes as Celsius aims to reorganize its assets and navigate its financial challenges. According to reports, the now-defunct platform has transferred sizeable amounts of its holdings to stablecoin issuer Paxos and market maker Wintermute in an effort to increase liquidity.</p>



<p>According to Data from analytics firm Kaiko, the value of Celsius&#8217; altcoin portfolio, consisting of both liquid and illiquid assets and its own CEL currency, has experienced sharp decreases. Since the opening of the institutional exchange EDX in June, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC) have seen increases. Still, most of Celsius&#8217; other assets have seen reductions ranging from -84% to -6%. The only asset that has lost more value than CEL, which made up a sizeable chunk of Celsius&#8217; altcoin holdings, is SRM, down 84% from the previous year. CEL has fallen by 83%.</p>



<p>The cryptocurrency liquidity surrounding Celsius raises questions about future market effects, according to Kaiko’s analysis. Liquidity for these tokens has decreased over the past year, with overall market depth falling by 40% since 2022 and amounting to about $90 million in early July. However, according to court filings, Celsius possesses altcoins with a value much above this one, making it difficult to liquidate without suffering a significant price drop.</p>



<p>According to Kaiko, “More than 60% of altcoin market depth is concentrated on Binance and other off-shore exchanges while 30% is on U.S. exchanges.”</p>



<p>As Celsius continues to liquidate altcoins, the larger altcoin market braces for probable short-term effects. The industry keeps a careful eye on these developments because it knows that a large player like Celsius can have a big impact on the market as a whole.</p>



<p>“There is virtually no liquidity for CEL as measured by market depth, which has collapsed to just $30k, concentrated mostly on OKX and Bybit.” Kaiko’s report states.</p>



<p>Since a sizable percentage of the altcoin market depth is focused on foreign exchanges, the market may be under pressure due to Celsius&#8217; continued liquidations. The effect of a significant company like Celsius on the market continues to be a subject of curiosity as industry experts keenly monitor these developments.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Celsius has accused StakeHound in a court filing of failing to return various tokens valued at $150 million that were entrusted to the liquid staking platform.</p>



<p>The filing includes a claim of contract breach and &#8220;wilful misconduct”. The tokens in question are valued at $300,000 in Polkadot (DOT) tokens, $120,000 in Ethereum (ETH), and $30,000,000 in Polygon (MATIC). In the ongoing bankruptcy procedures, Celsius requests the return of its property and monetary damages, legal costs, and attorneys&#8217; fees.</p>

<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/australias-big-four-bank-nba-to-mint-stablecoin-on-ethereum-algorand/">Algorand</a>, a state-of-the-art pure proof of stake network, is introducing innovative features that differentiate it from traditional proof of stake networks like Ethereum or delegated proof of stake networks like <a href="https://zycrypto.com/analysts-are-predicting-a-300-explosive-rally-for-cardano-amid-impressive-fundamentals-for-ada/">Cardano</a>, according to John Woods, Chief Technical Officer (CTO) at Algorand. In a recent Twitter Video-call, he explained that Algorand&#8217;s pure proof of stake mechanism incentivizes individual participation in consensus and decentralizes the network by disincentivizing pooling.</p>



<p>In pure proof of stake, an individual is randomly and deterministically selected from the entire set of stakers to validate and propose the next block, creating a more decentralized and secure network. Woods emphasizes the importance of security in blockchains, as the technology&#8217;s consensus mechanism is the heart. Algorand&#8217;s security model relies on having at least 80% of the declared stake online during block production to prevent network disruptions.</p>



<p>To ensure decentralization, Algorand encourages a diverse set of stakers geographically and computationally. The concentration of stakes on a single machine increases the risk of network failure, so large stakeholders are advised not to run staking nodes with more than 50 million ALGO.</p>



<p>He said: <em>“Now for most of us, including myself, 50 million ALGO, is a hell of a lot of cash and we don&#8217;t have to worry about that. But for very large companies or international players or venture capitalists or other people who may have very large positions in ALGO, of course they have to be careful that they don&#8217;t centralize too much ALGO or centralize over 20% of the stake on a single machine.”</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-working-towards-incentivizing-stakers"><strong>Working Towards Incentivizing Stakers</strong></h2>



<p>To enhance network security, the Algorand Foundation temporarily brought more of its custodial funds online. Despite the operational burden, this move increased the amount of ALGO staked, representing around 23% of all the Algorand in circulation. However, Woods acknowledges the need to prioritize organic stake from the community and reduce the foundation&#8217;s stake to achieve a more decentralized network.</p>



<p>Woods discusses the plan to incentivize consensus participation in Algorand, similar to how stakers earn rewards in other blockchain networks. The foundation is actively exploring ways to incentivize consensus and working on easy-to-run nodes and potential participant earnings. Woods believes incentivizing consensus will encourage organic stake growth, diversify stakers, and enhance network security.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Elephant in the Room: Algofi</strong></h2>



<p>In closing, Woods mentions the retirement of Algofi, a popular venue running on Algorand, expressing sadness but hoping that the funds there will be redistributed to other venues on the chain.</p>



<p>Regarding Algorand&#8217;s network security, the CTO emphasizes the importance of growing stakes in the network, making it easier for individuals to participate, and rewarding them for their contributions.</p>



<p>As Algorand continues to evolve, Woods assures that more information on incentivizing consensus will be shared in the coming weeks, alongside improvements to Algorand&#8217;s one-click nodes. The aim is to create a secure and decentralized network that benefits individual stakers and the entire ecosystem.</p>



<p>With its innovative approach to pure proof of stake and plans for incentivizing consensus, Algorand&#8217;s future looks promising as it strives to secure and enhance its popular blockchain network.</p>



<p>However, the competition it seems, was also listening in. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, known not to shy away from a quip with another blockchain, immediately responded with a tweet, he said: <em>“It might be prudent for Algorand to consider becoming a sidechain of Cardano. Always here to help.”</em></p>



<p>While it is most like meant in jest, commentators were quick to state that Hoskinson is friendly with the team at Algorand. Nonetheless, collaboration rather than working against each other seems the best way to move the industry forward.</p>

<p>Blockchain-based payment protocol company Ripple <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">notched a landmark win </a>against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday.</p>



<p>In a case that has been closely followed by attorneys and crypto industry players since late 2020, the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of New York ruled that Ripple did not violate federal securities laws by selling the XRP cryptocurrency on public exchanges.</p>



<p>Ripple’s court victory brought a modicum of regulatory clarity for the crypto industry, and America’s largest cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase said it would re-enable XRP trading. At the same time, Gemini revealed that it is considering listing the token on its platform.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-coinbase-cto-it-s-time-to-relist-xrp"><strong>Coinbase CTO: “It’s Time To Relist” XRP</strong></h2>



<p>Ripple’s XRP is back on Coinbase.</p>



<p>Following the recent bullish ruling, Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal announced that “it’s time to relist” the XRP token as the exchange feels comfortable allowing its trading.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&#39;ve read Judge Torres&#39; thoughtful decision. We&#39;ve carefully reviewed our analysis.  It&#39;s time to relist. <a href="https://t.co/dA70ucccgw">https://t.co/dA70ucccgw</a></p>&mdash; paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) <a href="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1679576508036259840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 13, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>In her decision, Judge Analisa Torres <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">ruled </a>that Ripple&#8217;s sale of XRP on exchanges and via algorithms did not constitute investment contracts. But $728 million worth of contracts to sell XRP to institutional investors did violate federal securities laws.</p>



<p>A slew of U.S.-based crypto exchanges suspended XRP trading in late 2020 when the SEC first <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">sued </a>Ripple. Coinbase noted Thursday that trading is “anticipated to begin later today” if liquidity conditions for the token are met. &#8220;Once sufficient supply of this asset is established trading on our XRP-USD, XRP-USDT and XRP-EUR trading pairs will launch in phases. Support for XRP may be restricted in some supported jurisdictions,” the exchange continued.</p>



<p>Coinbase itself is in the middle of an SEC lawsuit that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-suffers-double-whammy-as-sec-and-state-regulators-act-against-exchange-for-unregistered-securities/">alleges </a>it was operating an unregistered securities exchange that was dealing with unregistered securities. Coinbase denied the allegations, and the case is starting to go through its pre-trial motions. Some legal commentators are <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1679534350138785792">optimistic </a>that Ripple’s win will bolster Coinbase’s case against the SEC.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Gemini Weighs Listing XRP</strong></h2>



<p>Crypto exchange Gemini also said Thursday that it was mulling relisting XRP.</p>



<p>“Given today&#8217;s ruling that the sale of XRP on exchanges is not a security, @Gemini is exploring the listing of XRP for both spot and derivatives trading,&#8221; the exchange postulated <a href="https://twitter.com/Gemini/status/1679550388272283649">in a tweet</a>.</p>



<p>The series of bullish events saw the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-makes-a-comeback-as-holders-bet-on-huge-upsurge-amid-ripples-groundbreaking-win-in-sec-lawsuit/">price of XRP go off like a rocket</a>. It has soared by 67% since the judge’s ruling was announced. As of press time, it was changing hands at $0.78 and had become the fourth biggest crypto with a market capitalization of $41.2 billion after overtaking BNB Coin (BNB), according to CoinGecko.</p>



<p>More exchanges that had delisted XRP can be expected to follow in Coinbase’s suit and relist the asset.</p>

<p>Polygon Labs, the development team behind Ethereum scaling solution <a href="https://zycrypto.com/tag/polygon">Polygon</a>, has announced its new native token, POL. Through a Twitter announcement, Polygon Labs proposed an upgrade plan to replace the existing token, MATIC, with POL — thereby establishing POL as the exclusive token for all networks within the Polygon ecosystem.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/ Today, the next technical proposal of Polygon 2.0 is unveiled:<br><br>POL, the upgraded token of the Polygon protocol! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4ab.png" alt="💫" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br><br>POL is the next generation native token, designed to secure, align and grow the Polygon ecosystem.<br><br>Watch the video to get an idea how cool it is, then <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f9f5.png" alt="🧵" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/Gn7KcHpWEY">pic.twitter.com/Gn7KcHpWEY</a></p>&mdash; Polygon (Labs) (@0xPolygonLabs) <a href="https://twitter.com/0xPolygonLabs/status/1679427540790681600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 13, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>These networks include the Polygon mainnet, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/matic-magic-polygon-co-founder-proposes-radical-transformation-of-pos-blockchain/">Polygon zkEVM network</a>, and various Supernet chains (dedicated application chains running on the Polygon mainnet). If the proposal is accepted, POL will serve as a multi-purpose token, enabling network validators to support the operation of multiple chains using a single token.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_O1labsgjfONJaVrn3897sp_dgZpnEJ3bEJhWBR1nErZCKLmmNGWqOUGJbMJrkSjgU6M63jAHuKnjL0wMZTnAoKXcosWjlzftQt38ZUmHGl_Z9NNyzPaGMtplJv56pG5TAVHULITFYyFzuAaC44Sdg0" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Source: Polygon Blog</figcaption></figure>



<p>Upgrading from MATIC to POL would demand an upfront technical procedure: MATIC will have to be sent to an upgraded smart contract, automatically retrieving an equivalent amount in POL. If the community supports this initiative, token holders will have sufficient time to upgrade, such as four years or longer.</p>



<p>Each community of the Polygon chains will ultimately decide which token to use as gas fees. Some may opt for POL, and token holders can utilize POL to vote on governance proposals for DApps built on Polygon, with all rewards and incentives distributed in POL.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/MATICUSD/">TradingView data</a>, after the news was released, the price of the MATIC token rose from approximately $0.73 to $0.77 within an hour, representing a growth of over 5%.</p>

<ul>
<li>Galaxy Digital CEO believes Bitcoin (BTC) will finish the year on a high following a string of positives.</li>



<li>He notes that approving a Bitcoin ETF will be instrumental in pushing the asset class to new highs.</li>



<li>The U.S. SEC currently stands in staunch opposition to a spot ETF, but a wave of applications could see it lower its guard.</li>
</ul>



<p>Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz opines that if the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gives the green light for a spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF), it will turn around the fortunes of the largest virtual currency.</p>



<p>Novogratz disclosed in an interview with BloombergTV, noting that the SEC’s thumbs up for ETFs may be construed as a “seal of approval” for the asset class. He noted that a spike in the number of ETF applications in recent months has contributed to BTC’s meteoric rise in 2023.</p>



<p>BlackRock, Ark Invest, and WisdomTree have all <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-etfs-in-motion-an-analysis-of-open-spot-btc-etf-applications-in-the-market/">submitted</a> their applications for a spot Bitcoin ETFs, braving multiple rejections from the SEC.</p>



<p><em>“What I do think is BlackRock, Invesco, and the group of ETF providers is a real signal that adoption is coming,”</em> said Novogratz.</p>



<p>He pointed out that after over a decade since the first ETF application, the industry has garnered enough infrastructure to support the operations of ETFs. Novogratz added that akin to the approval of a futures ETF in 2021, the SEC may approve several firms at a go, given the similarities of their applications.</p>



<p><em>“The SEC is not going to approve one, so you’re going to have these giant sales forces out there giving access to people that didn’t have access before,” </em>Novogratz said.</p>



<p>He notes that the approval will send Bitcoin’s value soaring as new investors interact with the ETFs. In the weeks following the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/as-the-first-u-s-bitcoin-etf-debuts-grayscale-ceo-sees-an-ethereum-etf-rolling-out/">approval</a> of a BTC futures ETF, the asset reached its all-time high of $69,789.</p>



<p>However, Novogratz expressed scepticism over the SEC granting approvals before the end of the year, noting its hard stance toward cryptocurrencies.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-sec-s-argument-against-spot-etfs"><strong>The SEC’s argument against spot ETFs</strong></h2>



<p>The SEC has pointed out that spot BTC ETFs do not offer enough protections for individual investors, claiming that “the underlying spot market of bitcoin is subject to fraud and manipulation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the SEC rejected a batch of applications in June, it noted that the sections on a surveillance-sharing agreement with a trading platform were inadequate. Including the surveillance-sharing agreement has been described as the answer to the SEC’s concerns about price manipulation.</p>

<p>Against the odds of the broader crypto market, the value of XRP, the cryptocurrency linked to Ripple, has significantly skyrocketed, providing comfort to holders. The crypto asset has been able to draw the market&#8217;s attention following the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">latest judge ruling that XRP is not a security</a>.</p>



<p>The price of XRP increased dramatically over the past hour by around 28%, passing the significant $0.6 price level. XRP holders and enthusiasts now feel more optimistic as a result of Ripple&#8217;s victory over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>



<p>The distinctive qualities and prospective uses of XRP inside the financial sector contribute to its growing popularity.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to remember that XRP&#8217;s path has not been without challenges. The firm behind XRP, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-not-a-security-crypto-lawyer-muses-about-lessons-from-telegram-case-for-ripple-vs-sec-lawsuit/">Ripple, has been battling</a> the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in court over the cryptocurrency&#8217;s regulatory status. The result of this issue has always had a big impact on XRP&#8217;s future and its ability to function in the financial sector freely.</p>



<p>Despite the legal issues, XRP&#8217;s rigidity exemplifies the community of holders&#8217; tenacity. This development shows market participants value and see potential in crypto assets despite legislative uncertainty.</p>



<p>The peculiar position that XRP occupies in the market is another factor contributing to its growing demand. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, XRP acts as a medium of exchange for quick and inexpensive international transactions. Because of this functionality, financial institutions and payment processors have partnered with Ripple and worked with them.</p>



<p>Investors are carefully monitoring XRP&#8217;s essential support and resistance levels as it continues to gain traction. The current support level for the coin is $0.58, while the current resistance level is $0.644. These levels will probably be important in determining the direction of XRP&#8217;s price movement as we advance.</p>



<p>Despite the enthusiasm that the recent increase in XRP&#8217;s value has generated among cryptocurrency investors, it is crucial to exercise caution, given the market&#8217;s inherent volatility. As the case moves to trial, long-term prospects for XRP will likely be impacted by regulatory changes and the legal proceedings surrounding Ripple&#8217;s SEC complaint results.</p>



<p>However, the XRP community can now celebrate this comeback as the token&#8217;s successful performance instils a spirit of optimism and fresh zeal among its fans. Although the direction of XRP is still unclear, the recent increase serves as a reminder of its resiliency and promise in the face of a complex regulatory environment.</p>

<p>Ripple Labs has scored a major court victory after the federal judge presiding over the American blockchain payments company’s case against the Securities and Exchange Commission ruled that the XRP token is not a security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following the monumental ruling that could essentially reshape the crypto industry, XRP exploded by over 35%.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-judge-delivers-vital-summary-judgment-verdict"><strong>Judge Delivers Vital Summary Judgment Verdict</strong></h2>



<p>U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres has granted summary judgment in favor of Ripple, indicating that the XRP token is not a security.</p>



<p>Torres asserted that programmatic sales to public buyers and distributions of XRP to Ripple’s employees did not constitute the sale of unregistered securities.</p>



<p>She, however, ruled that $728 million worth of contracts for institutional sales did constitute unregistered securities sales and those investors &#8220;would have purchased XRP with the expectation that they would derive profits from Ripple’s efforts.&#8221;</p>



<p>Torres noted: &#8220;Therefore, having considered the economic reality and totality of circumstances surrounding the Institutional Sales, the Court concludes that Ripple’s Institutional Sales of XRP constituted the unregistered offer and sale of investment contracts in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act.&#8221;</p>



<p>In the lawsuit <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">lodged </a>in December 2020 by the SEC against Ripple and its executives CEO Brad Garlinghouse and co-founder Christian Larsen, the regulator aimed to compel Ripple to stop offering XRP to customers under the assertion that XRP was a security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By granting the summary judgment motion, Torres leaves the case open until a jury can weigh in at trial or if Ripple and SEC reach a settlement.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>XRP Skyrockets 35.5%</strong></h2>



<p>The positive ruling sent a ripple across the market after the sixth-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap dodged a securities classification. XRP surged from $0.45 to $0.63. This puts the token up over 35.5% as of the time of publication, according to data from CoinGecko.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crypto analyst Adam Cochran <a href="https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1679515809893294080">observed </a>that the ruling was a “big win for XRP” given its centralized foundation, with key figureheads, standard sales through exchanges, and formal distribution programs.</p>



<p>“We said in Dec 2020 that we were on the right side of the law and will be on the right side of history,&#8221; Ripple chief Brad Garlinghouse said in <a href="https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1679520607837253639?s=20">a tweet</a>. &#8220;Thankful to everyone who helped us get to today’s decision — one that is for all crypto innovation in the US. More to come.&#8221;</p>

<p>The former CEO of bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network was reportedly arrested on Thursday. The news was accompanied by a series of lawsuits against Mashinsky and Celsius by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mashinsky-arrested"><strong>Mashinsky Arrested</strong></h2>



<p>The law has finally caught up to Alex Mashinsky.</p>



<p>The former Celsius CEO was arrested on Thursday after a probe into the company&#8217;s collapse, as per a U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) indictment. Mashinsky was indicted on charges of securities fraud, wire fraud, and intention to manipulate the price of Celsius&#8217; token CEL.</p>



<p>Celsius, which was one of the crypto market’s highest-profile collapses, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ghosts-of-terra-awake-as-celsius-token-crashes-by-50-after-firm-pauses-withdrawals/">halted withdrawals </a>in June 2022, citing “extreme market conditions,” and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/after-1-month-of-halting-customers-withdrawals-giant-crypto-lender-celsius-goes-bankrupt/">filed </a>for bankruptcy protection a month later. At one point the New Jersey-based company held $30 billion in assets. A court-ordered bankruptcy examiner’s report showed that Celsius made extremely risky investment bets with clients’ funds.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-13/sec-files-lawsuit-against-celsius-network-alex-mashinsky?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_content=crypto&amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business#xj4y7vzkg">According to</a> <em>Bloomberg </em>sources, Mashinsky contrived a scheme to defraud customers of Celsius Network between 2018 and June 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Celsius was a popular crypto lending platform that allowed users to deposit cash and earn returns on their digital assets. However, following the implosion of Terra’s algorithmic stablecoin UST and the subsequent crypto market downturn, the firm was unable to fulfil a wave of customer withdrawals.</p>



<p>Celsius’ chief revenue officer Roni Cohen-Pavon was also arrested alongside Mashinsky.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Mashinsky’s Legal Woes</strong></h2>



<p>To add to Mashinsky’s woes, the SEC accused him and Celsius of securities fraud in a suit filed today. In the complaint, the SEC declared that CEL and Celsius&#8217; Earn product constituted securities.</p>



<p>“In this case, Celsius offered and sold CEL and the Earn Interest Program as securities…. Celsius and Mashinsky never filed a registration statement or had one in effect with the SEC for their offers and sales of securities through the Earn Interest Program,” the filing read.</p>



<p>The SEC&#8217;s fellow regulators, the CFTC and FTC, also filed civil actions against the former figurehead and Celsius on the same day. </p>



<p>The CFTC accused Mashinsky and Celsius of violating federal commodities regulations and participating in a &#8220;scheme to defraud hundreds of thousands of customers by mispresenting the safety and profitability of its digital asset-based finance platform.&#8221;</p>



<p>The suit by the FTC alleges that Mashinsky and the firm broke the Federal Trade Commission Act &#8220;in connection with the marketing and sale of cryptocurrency lending and custody services.&#8221;</p>



<p>Notably, Mashinsky is already facing a lawsuit <a href="https://decrypt.co/118491/new-york-attorney-general-ex-celsius-boss-alex-mashinksy">filed</a> by New York attorney general Letitia James in January this year. The AG accuses him of misleading Celsius investors, leading to billions of dollars in losses.</p>

<p>The year has presented a lot of ups and downs for blockchain networks. <a href="https://zycrypto.com/tag/solana">Solana</a>, one of the most promising proof-of-stake networks in the industry, has not been spared by the harsh market conditions.</p>



<p>After hitting a bump in the second quarter of the year, following a major pushback from regulatory bodies, Solana is attempting to strengthen its position as one of the major pioneers of DeFi in the industry.</p>



<p>According to key <a href="https://messari.io/report/state-of-solana-q2-2023?utm_medium=organic_social&amp;utm_source=twitter_messari&amp;utm_campaign=state_of_solana_q2_2023">insights</a> shared by Messari Crypto, a leading crypto intelligence firm, the Solana network saw its financial performance suffer from regulatory pushback.</p>



<p>Notably, the U.S. The Securities and Exchange Commission blacklisted several digital currencies, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ethereums-buterin-voices-sympathy-for-solana-and-other-tokens-targeted-by-sec/">including Solana (SOL)</a>. The U.S. <a href="https://zycrypto.com/far-from-securities-solana-polygon-and-cardano-issue-solid-statements-against-sec-claims/">SEC alleged </a>that a handful of cryptocurrency exchanges have unlawfully engaged in unregistered offers and sales of crypto asset securities, including SOL, MATIC, ADA, and many other assets.</p>



<p>Leading platforms like Robinhood, Revolut, and Bakkt delisted SOL. These actions, along with the SEC&#8217;s complaints, will later coincide with the downward pressure on the value of SOL, which declined by 9.2%, compared to the broader market’s 1.3% increase in QoQ.</p>



<p>SOL closed the second quarter as the 10th largest cryptocurrency, as its market cap settled at $7.2 billion.</p>



<p>“<em>Revenue in SOL (total transaction fees paid in SOL) was supported by higher priority fees paid in Q1 2023. However, revenue in SOL decreased by 15.0% QoQ as the percentage of daily fees paid in the local fee markets declined.</em>” Messari further asserted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the week, Solana (SOL) has outperformed its competitors as it managed to sustain weekly gains, while other altcoins remained in the red zone. SOL has surged by more than 10% within the last 7 days. The market cap is currently on the verge of hitting $9 billion. SOL now trades at a press time price of $22.31.</p>



<p>Expanding DeFi is at the forefront of Solana’s vision as we advance. However, as part of its comprehensive growth strategy, the Solana ecosystem is committed to broadening into other sectors. Data from Messari shows that liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) have continued to support Solana and its DeFi ecosystem.</p>



<p>Solend, one of the leading DeFi protocols on the Solana network, recently saw a 59% growth in its transaction volume. Solend would outperform Orca to become the largest DeFi protocol on the Solana network. The protocol now contributes to the new capital inflow entering the Solana DeFi ecosystem.</p>

<ul>
<li>Virtual currency scams are down by a staggering 65% since the start of 2023.</li>



<li>Two of the largest scams end operations while romance and investment scams run out of steam.</li>



<li>On the flip side, experts warn investors to brace for increased ransomware attacks targeted at digital asset wallets.</li>
</ul>



<p>As crypto asset prices stage a brave recovery in mid-2023, there has been a marked decline in the activities of digital asset scammers, but the threat of ransomware still lurks in the shadows.</p>



<p>On July 12, Chainalysis released its “Crypto Crime Mid-year Update”, indicating a major slump in digital asset scams. According to the <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/crypto-crime-midyear-2023-update-ransomware-scams/?mkt_tok=NTAzLUZBUC0wNzQAAAGM6wGWvw9ud1Yw3cbLMTJ0ztxTgBByxK-1ZylygyLCUc1qkfF88Ly4lCbOQXPMc1_8LSeptcWk0NGLl30d9KEEWSaCKkGm-_KwCLNP5GRxX4yZ">report</a>, on-chain analytics to well-known scams and shady mixers are down by over 50%.</p>



<p>The decline in scam revenue is noteworthy as it comes on the heels of a strong resurgence of virtual currencies, with average prices up by 80%.</p>



<p><em>“Usually, positive price movements translate to higher scam revenue, likely because increased market exuberance and FOMO make victims more susceptible to scammers’ pitches. But 2023’s drastic scam declines that long-standing trend,”</em> said Chainalysis.</p>



<p>In its report, Chainalysis rationalizes the plummeting scam activity to the disappearance of major crypto scams &#8211; VidiLook and Chia Tai Tianquing. At the height of their powers, both investment scams defrauded victims of over $130 million worth of digital assets following the shutting down of their operations.</p>



<p><em>“VidiLook’s exit scam isn’t surprising, but what is surprising is that total scam revenue remains so low after its decline</em>,” read the report. “<em>Ordinarily, we’d expect new scams to fill the void.”</em></p>



<p>Another reason for the declining revenue for scammers is the increase in <a href="https://zycrypto.com/rising-crypto-based-pig-butchering-scams-worry-fbi-interpol/">public advisories</a> by law enforcement agencies, warning victims of the dangers of investing in unlicensed virtual currency offerings.</p>



<p>While investment, pig butchering, and romance scams have borne the brunt of the hit, impersonation scams are thriving. Chainalysis’ data indicates that impersonation scams have surged by 49% in the last 12 months, with more individuals falling victim to extortions from fake law enforcement officers.</p>



<p>Despite the wins notched by the industry, Chainalysis warns that ransomware crime is gathering momentum and could net as much as $800 million before the end of the year. Ransomware gangs are “big game hunting” &#8211; opting to target large corporations over smaller entities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-failing-to-sustain-the-highs-of-2022"><strong>Failing to sustain the highs of 2022</strong></h2>



<p>In 2022, virtual currency scams reached their zenith, with bad actors stealing over $6 billion from their victims. Pig butchering scams and ransomware attacks reigned supreme while hacks against Ronin, Wormhole, and Nomad rocked the industry.</p>



<p>State-backed cybercriminals from <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-assists-us-law-enforcement-in-seizing-4-4m-linked-to-north-korean-organized-crime-freezes-accounts/">North Korea</a> pilfered over $1 billion throughout 2022, with the bulk of stolen funds used to finance the development of nuclear warheads. North Korea-based Lazarus Group was fingered in the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/harmonys-one-token-nosedives-double-digits-after-hacker-drained-100m-from-horizon-bridge/">$100 million heist</a> on the Horizon Bridge and may have masterminded the attack against Atomic Wallet.</p>

<p>The outspoken CEO of Galaxy Digital, Mike Novogratz, believes that the recent spate of applications for spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) from high-profile asset managers if approved, would represent a “seal of approval” for crypto from the U.S. government and its top securities watchdog. This means the potential approvals would signal wider adoption of cryptocurrencies. He points to $9 trillion asset manager BlackRock as a signal of this coming adoption.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-spot-etf-approval-is-the-long-awaited-seal-of-approval-for-btc"><strong>Spot ETF Approval Is The Long-Awaited “Seal of Approval” For BTC</strong></h2>



<p>The greenlight of spot bitcoin ETFs would basically be a nod for crypto from the United States government and its securities regulator.</p>



<p>During a July 12 <a href="https://youtu.be/3_3CvNhs2FE">interview </a>with <em>Bloomberg</em>, Galaxy Digital’s Mike Novogratz highlighted the potential of ETFs that track the spot market value of bitcoin (as opposed to existing futures-based ETFs) in driving widespread cryptocurrency adoption. “What I do think is BlackRock, Invesco [and] the group of ETF providers is a real signal that adoption is coming,” Novogratz posited.</p>



<p>The moment finance giant BlackRock <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-primed-for-trillion-dollar-boost-as-blackrock-expects-landmark-bitcoin-etf-approval/">filed </a>to introduce a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S., industry observers believed that the world’s largest asset manager had a high chance of approval than the many rejected predecessors due to its nearly flawless ETF application record.</p>



<p>In Novogratz’s opinion, many investors are nervous about dipping their toes into the crypto market. The okaying of a spot bitcoin ETF may be the first step for most to begin pouring their money into crypto.</p>



<p><em>“I just think if it happens, it’s the seal of approval from the SEC and the U.S. government.”</em></p>



<p>The crypto bull indicated that the SEC was not only going to approve BlackRock’s proposed ETF but also the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-etfs-in-motion-an-analysis-of-open-spot-btc-etf-applications-in-the-market/">filings </a>from other applicants, including Valkyrie, Fidelity,&nbsp; Invesco, VanEck, WisdomTree, and ARK Invest. “So you’re going to have these giant sales forces out there giving access to people that didn’t have access before,” Novogratz observed.</p>



<p>However, he warned that the U.S.&#8217;s regulatory environment is still frustrating, with the SEC maintaining a &#8220;really tough&#8221; stance on crypto assets.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Novogratz Expects BTC To End The Year Higher&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Mike Novogratz also noted that the world is currently in the early stages of accepting Bitcoin as a macro asset.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, he still thinks the flagship cryptocurrency’s ongoing consolidation phase, around $28,000 and $32,000, will likely be the harbinger of a significant bull rally. “If you take out the top, we’ll have a nice leg up,” Novogratz predicted, noting that he expects bitcoin to trade higher by the close of 2023.</p>



<p>This potential meteoric upsurge, as per Novogratz, will happen when the U.S. Federal Reserve pivots and flinches in response to the increased interest and appetite for BTC.</p>

<p>The United States government has once again moved Bitcoin tied to Silk Road, the now-shuttered darknet marketplace.</p>



<p>Two wallets belonging to the U.S. Justice Department moved over $300 million worth of Bitcoin to two new addresses on Wednesday morning. The transfer was conducted in three different transactions, as <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/addresses/btc/bc1qmxjefnuy06v345v6vhwpwt05dztztmx4g3y7wp">shown </a>by on-chain data from Blockchain.com.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-300-million-in-btc"><strong>$300 Million In BTC</strong></h2>



<p>Some of Silk Road’s bitcoins are on the move once again.</p>



<p>Fed-controlled wallets sent a total of 9,825 Bitcoin, equating to approximately $301 million. Wednesday’s transaction follows an even bigger transaction in March when roughly <a href="https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1633331891347820544">$1 billion worth of BTC</a> was transferred, a move that prompted a drop across all top cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The U.S. authorities have control of BTC that&#8217;s been confiscated from bad actors and occasionally move it around. Previously, they&#8217;ve done so because they plan to sell it — but not all the time.</p>



<p>The latest transfer has stoked investor fears that intense sell pressures could drive down the price of Bitcoin. BTC dipped after the transaction was sent. The premier cryptocurrency was, at the time of publication trading hands for $30,327.04 per coin, a 0.8% 24-hour drop. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Silk Road Bitcoin</strong></h2>



<p>Feds seized more than 50,000 bitcoins in November 2022 from hacker James Zhong, who pleaded guilty to wire fraud over the hack of these digital assets from the Ross Ulbricht-run Silk Road back in 2012.</p>



<p>Ross Ulbricht is the proprietor of the Silk Road online black market, which was used to mostly buy and sell illicit goods such as weapons, drugs, and stolen credit card information and primarily used bitcoin as a payment method before authorities closed it in 2014. Ulbricht was sentenced to life in federal prison back in 2015 in a high-profile case. He’s currently serving a double life sentence plus 40 years without the possibility of parole. </p>



<p>Court filings contained details of related BTC wallets, allowing online sleuths to track these wallet addresses. Feds have been selling the seized BTC bit by bit. After selling the crypto in March, the U.S. authorities said they intended to dump the remaining bitcoin in four more batches throughout 2023.&nbsp;</p>
