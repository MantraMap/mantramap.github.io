					<description><![CDATA[The dynamic and ever-evolving blockchain community has shown a great deal of interest in and enthusiasm for Toncoin (TON). Due to its technological underpinnings and innovative answers to the long-standing problems that have plagued the field of decentralized finance, this digital money has risen to popularity very quickly. At the time of writing, TON was trading at $1.46, registering an impressive 10.4% increase in the last 24 hours.

During this period of consolidation, prices moved inexactly between $1.31 and $1.49, showing a restricted and steady trading range. Toncoin Shows Signs Of Resilience Several times throughout this period of consolidation, the cryptocurrency showed signs of trying to rise beyond the $1.50 barrier, which may have suggested a possible upward trend. However, bullish market forces were unable to push the price over the $1.50 level, and the price ultimately closed below that level. The continuation of these adverse influences indicates that traders and investors are currently exercising caution. The bears&#8217; stubbornness implies there&#8217;s a widespread view that the market can&#8217;t handle a prolonged rise above $1.50 just yet.

					<description><![CDATA[The Shiba Inu (SHIB) coin has exceeded even the top 10 established cryptocurrencies this week, posting a solid 15% increase that has captivated the attention of the cryptocurrency community.

					<description><![CDATA[Voyager Digital has been busy in recent months as it looks to sell its remaining crypto holdings on centralized exchanges. In its latest move, the bankrupt crypto brokerage has transferred millions in SHIB and ETH to Coinbase. According to on-chain data, Voyager moved SHIB and ETH tokens to Coinbase&#8217;s ledger on Friday, August 11. Millions In SHIB And ETH Transferred To Coinbase By Voyager Voyager has been selling off assets since the beginning of the year. Specifically, the latest on-chain transactions show that Voyager moved a total of $5.5 million in crypto to Coinbase. The transactions consisted of 1,500 ETH sent in two transactions.  Related Reading: Did XRP Price Really Hit $50 On Gemini Exchange? Before being moved to Coinbase, 1,000 ETH and 500 ETH, with a combined value of $2.77 million, were sent to separate wallets. Another 250 billion SHIB valued at $2.7 million was then sent to Coinbase.  On-chain data also shows that Voyager has been moving all its token holdings to its primary address. This likely means the company is consolidating its crypto assets before moving them to crypto exchanges. Bankrupt crypto firm Voyager transferred 1,500 ETH ($2.77 million) and 250 billion SHIB ($2.7 million) to Coinbase. Additionally, Voyager is moving all remaining tokens to the main address. There are currently about $81.63 million worth of cryptocurrency in Voyager addresses.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) August 12, 2023 Looking To Pay Pack Customers Voyager’s goal is to eventually reimburse all customer accounts, at least partially. The firm went bankrupt last year after the failure of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital which failed to repay its $665 million Voyager loan. The company, however, received court approval in May 2023 to begin winding down its operations and start repaying customers a portion of their crypto assets that’s been locked for over a year. According to court filings, Voyager had only about $630 million to pay back $1.8 billion in customer claims. As a result, Voyager users could only claim 35.72% of their tokens. They could either withdraw their claims immediately or choose to wait for 30 days to be paid in USD after Voyager sells the tokens.  VGX prices tanks as bankruptcy proceedings continue &#124; Source: VGXUSDT on Tradingview.com  At the time, data from Arkham Intelligence showed that Voyager had $268 million in ETH, $236 million in USDC, and $77 million in SHIB. But now that the time for customer claims is over, Voyager seems to be consolidating its remaining assets into one address before selling them. According to Arkham Intel, there is currently about $81.63 million worth of cryptocurrency left in Voyager addresses. What This Means For SHIB And ETH Prices The recent transfers of millions of dollars in SHIB and ETH tokens from Voyager Digital to Coinbase could signal selling pressure is on the way for the two cryptocurrencies. If Coinbase unloads these tokens onto the open market, it may drive prices down further as supply outpaces demand.  Related Reading: San Francisco’s SoFi Bank Reveals Significant Holdings In BTC, ETH, And DOGE SHIB is currently on a roll and is up by 15.55% in a 7-day timeframe. ETH, on the other hand, is currently ranging around $1,850 after the ETH ecosystem reached a milestone recently with the number of non-zero addresses reaching a new all-time high.

<p>At the time, data from Arkham Intelligence <a href="https://twitter.com/ArkhamIntel/status/1633892454310227968?s=20" rel="nofollow">showed that</a> Voyager had $268 million in ETH, $236 million in USDC, and $77 million in SHIB. But now that the time for customer claims is over, Voyager seems to be consolidating its remaining assets into one address before selling them. According to Arkham Intel, there is<a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1690177342902304768?s=20" rel="nofollow"> currently</a> about $81.63 million worth of cryptocurrency left in Voyager addresses.</p>
What This Means For SHIB And ETH Prices
<p>The recent transfers of millions of dollars in SHIB and ETH tokens from Voyager Digital to Coinbase could signal selling pressure is on the way for the two cryptocurrencies. If Coinbase unloads these tokens onto the open market, it may drive prices down further as supply outpaces demand. </p>

<p>SHIB is <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shib-profitability-pumps-as-meme-coins-continue-to-rally/">currently on a roll</a> and is up by 15.55% in a 7-day timeframe. ETH, on the other hand, is currently ranging around $1,850 after the ETH ecosystem reached a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/new-milestone-for-ethereum/#:~:text=Ethereum%20Non%2DZero%20Addresses%20Reach%20New%20All%2DTime%20High&amp;text=As%20of%20the%20time%20of,100%25%20jump%20during%20this%20time.">milestone recently</a> with the number of non-zero addresses reaching a new all-time high.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[With multiple applications for a spot Bitcoin ETF already filed, many have continued to speculate when the SEC is likely to give its approval or otherwise. To further add to speculations, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, citing his sources, stated that approval was likely to come within four to six months. However, recent developments seem to suggest that the wait could be longer.  SEC Stalling?

Following the standard procedures, the SEC was meant to approve or disapprove the application by August 13. However, with its latest order calling for public input on ARK 21 Shares application, this deadline is consequently extended.  With this, the general public has three weeks to give further comments on the proposal, while the SEC has another five weeks to respond to any comments it may receive. Furthermore, the SEC can choose to extend the deadline by 240 days at the maximum (a move that could potentially delay a final response until Jan 10, 2024). This news would most likely not come as a surprise to ARK Invest’s CEO Cathie Wood, as she had predicted a delay when speaking to Bloomberg on August 7. She also forecasted that the SEC might approve multiple Bitcoin ETF applications. However, nothing is certain, as the regulator could also deny all applications as it has done in the past.

					<description><![CDATA[Chainlink (LINK) has been one of the top trending tokens in recent weeks due to a combination of an overall positive price movement as well as exciting on-chain developments.  Following a recent buying spree in the LINK market, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has taken to social media platform X, providing some insights on the token’s potential price action. Related Reading: LINK Price Prediction: Chainlink Turns Attractive On Dips 29,000 Wallets Purchase 295 Million LINK Forming Major Support Level On August 11, Ali posted on X stating that Chainlink has established a strong support zone between $6.63 and $6.88 as about 29,000 addresses purchased over 295 million LINK at this price range based on data from analytics firm IntoTheBlock. Moving on, he postulated that as long as the altcoin was trading above this price zone, investors were likely to continuously remain bullish, especially as Soon-chain data shows that there are no significant resistance levels ahead.  Source: IntoTheBlock According to Ali, a good number of LINK whales have already recognized the $6.63-6.88 zone as “robust” price support and are actively accumulating more tokens. He highlighted that in the past 14 days, LINK whales have purchased an estimated 13 million LINK worth around $91 million.  However, while these developments may be considered indications of a bullish LINK market, Ali states that traders anticipating a market breakout may still need to exercise some patience. Using data from IntoTheBlock, the crypto analyst draws attention to the declining network activity on the Chainlink network in the last three weeks.  Ali stated that during this period, the number of large LINK transactions had gone down from 527 to 118. He concluded his market report by stating a boost in this metric is likely to precede any market breakout. At the time of writing, LINK is exchanging hands at $7.44, with a 1.36% decline in the last day, according to data from CoinMarketCap. However, the token is up 3.66% and 17.67% in the last seven and thirty days, respectively. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) Holds Above 14% Gains As Crypto Market Slumps Heavily More Good News For Chainlink Aside from Ali’s market analysis, there has been other positive news about Chainlink in recent days. Also, on August 11, market intelligence firm Santiment reported LINK had experienced its highest level of dormant coin movements in the last six weeks. According to Santiment, this represented a decline in LINK’s mean dollar invested age curve, pointing to a decrease in the token’s time in wallets which is usually a precursor for a rise in market cap. In addition, Chainlink has maintained a rise in its development activity over the last few months. Based on data from Santiment, development activity on Chainlink went up from 1579.12 on May 31 to 1706.48 on August 3.  LINK trading at $7.432 on the daily chart &#124; Source: LINKUSD chart on Tradingview.com Featured image from Stockhead, chart from Tradingview]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The dynamic world of cryptocurrencies has once again witnessed a fascinating turn of events, this time with THORChain (RUNE) taking center stage. Over the past seven days, THORChain has experienced a substantial surge in its price, marking an impressive increase of 20.19%. This resurgence has sparked intrigue and excitement among crypto enthusiasts and investors, prompting a closer examination of the factors contributing to this rapid upward movement. The Catalysts Behind The Surge RUNE has made a resurgence in recent months from its lows in June to its recent highs gaining 40% during this period. However, its price is still 10% down from the start of the year and there are expectations that this could be an extended bullrun.  Related Reading: Shiba Inu Keeps Energy Alive, Snags 26% Gain – Here’s The Inside Scoop The surge in THORChain&#8217;s price invites a deeper investigation into the underlying dynamics and catalysts that have propelled this substantial price rally. While a myriad of factors often influences the cryptocurrency market, several key drivers may have played a role in THORChain&#8217;s recent surge: Substantial progress in THORChain&#8217;s underlying technology, protocol enhancements, and ecosystem expansion has triggered renewed interest and investment. Positive fundamental developments often align with price surges as investors anticipate potential long-term growth prospects. Cryptocurrency markets are renowned for their inherent volatility. While volatility can create risks, it allows traders to capitalize on price swings. The recent surge in THORChain&#8217;s price may be driven, in part, by heightened market volatility. THORChain (RUNE): Forecasting Future Trajectories Considering THORChain&#8217;s recent surge, attention naturally turns to the future prospects of this cryptocurrency. Various experts and analysts have offered their insights into THORChain&#8217;s potential trajectory. Related Reading: GMX Drops 24% in 1 Month, Whales Rapidly Selling: What’s Going On? According to short-term prediction, THORChain&#8217;s price could experience a minor retracement to $1.02 by August 16, followed by a recovery to $1.24 by September 9. This prediction underscores the inherent volatility of short-term price movements. Looking ahead to 2023, divergent forecasts paint a range of possibilities. CaptainAltCoin suggests a potential dip to $0.6726 by October, with the year closing at $0.8817. However, if the bull run continues to persist there could be a spike to $2.12 by the year&#8217;s end.  Navigating The Unpredictable Path Ahead As THORChain continues its remarkable surge, the crypto community remains captivated by its price movement. The convergence of various factors, including market sentiment, technical indicators, fundamental developments, and overall market volatility, has likely contributed to this recent rally. However, the cryptocurrency landscape is known for its unpredictability, and the path ahead for THORChain remains uncertain. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice.

<p>Looking ahead to 2023, divergent forecasts paint a range of possibilities. CaptainAltCoin suggests a potential dip to $0.6726 by October, with the year closing at $0.8817. However, if the bull run continues to persist there could be a spike to $2.12 by the year&#8217;s end. </p>
<strong>Navigating The Unpredictable Path Ahead</strong>
<p>As THORChain continues its remarkable surge, the crypto community remains captivated by its price movement. The convergence of various factors, including market sentiment, technical indicators, fundamental developments, and overall market volatility, has likely contributed to this recent rally. However, the cryptocurrency landscape is known for its unpredictability, and the path ahead for THORChain remains uncertain.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[North America could see its share in the global trading volume for crypto-related exchange-traded funds (ETFs) grow even further if spot Bitcoin ETFs are approved in the United States, a Bloomberg analyst said. This comes after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a delay letter regarding Ark Invest’s application for a spot Bitcoin ETF. In a widely-anticipated delay, the SEC is asking for new written comments on the spot Bitcoin application. Some of the issues raised by the commission include the suitability of Bitcoin as an underlying asset of an exchange-traded product, and the resistance of Bitcoin to price manipulation, amongst other things. The Ark Invest spot ETF, proposed by leading asset management firm ARK Invest in conjunction with Swiss-based 21Shares, would give investors indirect exposure to Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency in the market.  This recent setback has raised questions about the fate of the spot Bitcoin ETF applications of other asset management companies, including Blackrock, Valkyrie, WisdomTree, etc. Related Reading: Black Swan Author Warns Of Bitcoin Volume Slump As BTC Fails To Breach $30,000 North America&#8217;s Share Of Global ETF Trading Volume To Reach 99.5%? In the event that the spot Bitcoin ETF applications get greenlighted by the SEC, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said that the North American region may see its percentage of the crypto ETF trading volumes reach 99.5%. According to his post on X (formerly Twitter), North America currently accounts for 97.67% of the total crypto ETF trading volume in the world. “If/when spot ETFs come out in the US this will likely go to like 99.5%,” Balchunas noted. In another post, the Bloomberg analyst disclosed that most of the best-performing equity ETFs in 2023 are crypto-related. At the top of this list is $WGMI, the Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF, with a year-to-date return of 227%. This actively-managed fund invests in public companies in the Bitcoin mining industry, including Riot, Bitdeer, Cipher Mining, etc. Given the positive performance of these mining firms’ stocks, it is no surprise that investment products, like $WGMI, are doing well. Other top-performing crypto-related exchange-traded products on this list include the VanEck Digital Transformation ETF, with a YTD return of 182%; the Global X Blockchain ETF, which has returned 168% so far in 2023; and the Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF, also up by roughly 168% year to date. Pending Grayscale Lawsuit To Be Pivotal To Bitcoin ETF Approval In 2022, Grayscale Investments sued the SEC for rejecting the application to convert its flagship product, GBTC, into a spot Bitcoin ETF.  According to Nathan Geraci, president of the ETF Store, the final judgment in this lawsuit could prove pivotal in the race for Bitcoin exchange-traded fund.  Geraci commented on the delay of Ark Invest ETF:  It all comes down to the outcome of the Grayscale lawsuit &#38; SEC&#8217;s view of question #4 here (referring to the fourth subject the commission is seeking comments on).

					<description><![CDATA[In the context of the constantly changing and complex cryptocurrency industry, Bitcoin is currently facing a critical point in its trajectory, as it confronts a range of heightened price pressures that pose significant challenges. The upcoming halving event in 2024 has generated significant anticipation, drawing attention to the complex interaction of various elements that contribute to the value and destiny of the subject in question. Bitcoin&#8217;s value has increased by 75% so far this year despite having to deal with regulatory scrutiny and fraud. The leading crypto in terms of market cap and widespread adoption has shown surprising resilience in the face of US Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement actions against key exchanges like Binance.US and Coinbase. Bitcoin&#8217;s Price Performance Currently, Bitcoin is trading around $29,411, up a meager 0.2% in the last day, but managed to gain a decent 1.4% in the last week, data from crypto market tracker Coingecko shows. Bitcoin is currently showing a neutral stance in the market and facing resistance as it tries to surpass the key $29,600 mark.

Source: Coingecko If there&#8217;s a bullish breakout above $29,600, it could potentially open up the path for Bitcoin to reach the $30,200 level. The top coin has already reached the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level, which is at $29,200. Bitcoin reached a market cap of $572 billion on the weekend chart: TradingView.com On the other hand, Bitcoin&#8217;s price could change in a big way if it can break through the support level of $30,200. This accomplishment could act as a catalyst and push the value of the coin into a new range, which is thought to be between $30,600 and $31,000. Such a breakthrough could make the market more hopeful and boost investor trust, which could set the stage for more growth. The critical zones to watch are $29,800 and $30,200. If Bitcoin&#8217;s price moves below these levels, it could indicate a bearish trend for the cryptocurrency.

Before the previous halving in May 2020, Bitcoin saw a range-bound period without major gains. The most significant price surge occurred about six months post-halving, initiating a bullish market trend in November of that year. Understanding Bitcoin Halving Bitcoin halving refers to the occurrence where miners&#8217; rewards for validating blockchain transactions are halved. This event takes place roughly every 210,000 mined blocks, which translates to approximately every four years. Introduced by Bitcoin&#8217;s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, in 2009, halvings serve the purpose of regulating asset supply. The mining reward reduces by half every 210,000 blocks, aligning with Nakamoto&#8217;s original vision as outlined in the white paper. This mechanism ensures the controlled creation of Bitcoin and maintains incentives for miners. The historical trend of halvings driving price escalation underscores the intricate interplay between scarcity, demand, and Bitcoin&#8217;s valuation, accentuating the anticipation surrounding the forthcoming halving&#8217;s influence on prices.

					<description><![CDATA[Polkadot (DOT) has managed to capture the attention of traders and investors alike. Despite a persistently bearish market structure, recent indicators point towards a potential bullish recovery on the horizon.  As of the latest data from CoinGecko, DOT is currently trading at $5.02, with a 0.7% gain in the past 24 hours and a 1.5% increase over the past seven days. Polkadot price action today. Source: Coingecko With the broader market experiencing an upward price trajectory, DOT buyers are poised to reap potential benefits. Analyzing the market dynamics, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has unveiled a recovering buying pressure.  Signs Of Revival Emerge Amidst Market Uncertainty A recent price analysis points out that the RSI has edged closer to the neutral 50 level, marking a significant shift from its recent spell within the oversold zone. This shift suggests an increasing appetite for DOT tokens among traders, potentially setting the stage for a bullish resurgence. Related Reading: Rising Star Hedera (HBAR) And Its 11% Climb – A Closer Look Further fueling the optimism, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator has displayed an uptick in buyer confidence. The CMF, a measure of the volume and flow of capital into or out of a cryptocurrency, has made a decisive move from the zero mark, currently standing at +0.20. This reading highlights the influx of capital into DOT, indicating a growing sense of positivity and enthusiasm among buyers. Polkadot (DOT) market cap at $6.09 billion on the weekend chart: TradingView.com Polkadot Bulls Eye Key Price Levels, Bears Await In the coming days, bulls within the DOT market are gearing up to challenge the bears for ownership of the crucial $5.23 price level. A successful flip of this level into a support zone could potentially pave the way for further gains.  Market analysts speculate that should this support level be reclaimed, DOT could make strides towards $5.50 and potentially reach $6. However, a rejection at these levels could send DOT on a downward trajectory, with a potential dip towards the $4.5 range. $DOT #Polkadot If it goes down to the last low at $4 it would be a 16% loss. If it goes up to the big resistance at 24$ it would be a 375% profit. Do you think it&#8217;s worth the risk to buy at $5? pic.twitter.com/GPBSm7XKpM — Tony ₿itcoin⚡ (@Toni_Bitcoin) August 11, 2023 The outcome of DOT&#8217;s price movements is also tied to the performance of the broader cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin (BTC). Should BTC fail to sustain its ongoing price rally, DOT&#8217;s trajectory could be influenced.

The resurgence in buying pressure, coupled with the growing confidence of buyers as depicted by the CMF indicator, sets an optimistic tone for the future.  As the battle between bulls and bears ensues, traders and investors alike will keenly watch the pivotal price levels, with the hope of witnessing a substantial market turnaround.

<p>A recent price analysis points out that the RSI has edged closer to the neutral 50 level, marking a significant shift from its recent spell within the oversold zone. This shift suggests an increasing appetite for DOT tokens among traders, potentially setting the stage for a bullish resurgence.</p>

<p>Further fueling the optimism, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator has displayed an uptick in buyer confidence. The CMF, a measure of the volume and flow of capital into or out of a cryptocurrency, has made a decisive move from the zero mark, currently standing at +0.20. This reading highlights the influx of capital into DOT, indicating a growing sense of positivity and enthusiasm among buyers.</p>

<h2><strong>Polkadot Bulls Eye Key Price Levels, Bears Await</strong></h2>
<p>In the coming days, bulls within the DOT market are gearing up to challenge the bears for ownership of the crucial $5.23 price level. A successful flip of this level into a support zone could potentially pave the way for further gains. </p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Toni_Bitcoin/status/1690032676571373568" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Market analysts speculate</a> that should this support level be reclaimed, DOT could make strides towards $5.50 and potentially reach $6. However, a rejection at these levels could send DOT on a downward trajectory, with a potential dip towards the $4.5 range.</p>

If it goes down to the last low at $4 it would be a 16% loss.
If it goes up to the big resistance at 24$ it would be a 375% profit.
Do you think it&#8217;s worth the risk to buy at $5? <a href="https://t.co/GPBSm7XKpM" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/GPBSm7XKpM</a></p>

<p>The outcome of DOT&#8217;s price movements is also tied to the performance of the broader cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin (BTC). Should BTC fail to sustain its ongoing price rally, DOT&#8217;s trajectory could be influenced.</p>

<p>While the cryptocurrency market remains inherently volatile and unpredictable, the recent indicators surrounding Polkadot signal the possibility of a bullish recovery. The resurgence in buying pressure, coupled with the growing confidence of buyers as depicted by the CMF indicator, sets an optimistic tone for the future. </p>
<p>As the battle between bulls and bears ensues, traders and investors alike will keenly watch the pivotal price levels, with the hope of witnessing a substantial market turnaround.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Solana (SOL) has managed to shake off recent price dips, rekindling bullish optimism among investors. This resurgence comes on the heels of a determined effort by sellers to flip the altcoin&#8217;s trajectory bearish, following a price rejection at the critical $29 resistance level.  However, SOL&#8217;s retreat from this resistance proved to be a strategic move as it found support in the bullish order block (OB) at $22, setting the stage for a renewed uptrend. SOL&#8217;s journey from the formidable $29 price mark to the bullish order block at $22 was pivotal. A recent price analysis has underscored the importance of this OB as a key level for the altcoin&#8217;s potential reversal of fortunes.  Related Reading: Shiba Inu Keeps Energy Alive, Snags 26% Gain – Here’s The Inside Scoop With a long-term perspective in mind, Solana&#8217;s ability to rally from this OB demonstrates the resolve of buyers to reclaim control. This recovery has not only bolstered sentiment but also signified the strategic importance of this price juncture in steering the trend. BTC&#8217;s Influence On SOL&#8217;s Trajectory One notable factor underpinning Solana&#8217;s current narrative is the role of Bitcoin (BTC), the flagship cryptocurrency. As SOL seeks to flip the $25.3 resistance level into a supportive base for further gains, its success may very well depend on the continued bullish advance of Bitcoin. The interplay between these two prominent cryptocurrencies remains a significant aspect to monitor, as BTC&#8217;s trajectory often influences the broader altcoin market sentiment. At present, Solana stands at a price of $24.50, as per CoinGecko data. Despite a slight decline of 1.0% over the last 24 hours, the altcoin has showcased a commendable seven-day rally of 8.8%, indicative of its capacity to rebound from adversities.  Solana weekend price action.

The impending supply pressure at this level could potentially stall the upward momentum, prompting a sideways trend and leading to a consolidation phase. Solana: Clearing The Path Forward Should the SOL price encounter intensified supply pressure around the $25.7 threshold, a distinct possibility is the emergence of a narrow price range during trading sessions. This consolidation phase, while seemingly a temporary lull, may serve a vital purpose. By trimming away weaker positions, this period could pave the way for a definitive directional movement.
