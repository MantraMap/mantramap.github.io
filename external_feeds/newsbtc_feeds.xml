According to recent data, institutions have been getting their hands on the cryptocurrency at a steady rate, as reflected in the digital asset fund flows report.  Institutional XRP Holdings Rise Rapidly In the days following Ripple’s partial victory in the SEC lawsuit, XRP volumes and prices rose dramatically as crypto traders rushed to the cryptocurrency in anticipation of a continued bull run. However, price metrics from Coinmarketcap show that the euphoria has subsided, with XRP now down 13.39% in a monthly time frame.

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin&#8217;s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, created Bitcoin in response to the 2008 financial crisis as an alternative to government-controlled money. Since then, Bitcoin has gone to spearhead the crypto industry, with many investors calling it digital gold. Now, renowned finance author Robert Kiyosaki has argued that Bitcoin price could reach $100,000 soon and go as high as $1 million. Bold Prediction On Bitcoin Robert Kiyosaki, best known for his bestselling book ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad,’ is known to make very bullish predictions on the price of Bitcoin. In a recent post on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, Kiyosaki tweeted of Bitcoin reaching 100,000 soon, calling it the &#8220;people&#8217;s gold.&#8221; However, a stock and bond market crash could see Bitcoin reach $1 million. Related Reading: US Prosecutors Accuse FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried Of Using $100M To Curry Political Favors Kiyosaki also shared his predictions on gold and silver, calling them &#8220;GOD’S money.&#8221; According to the finance educator, gold and silver can reach $75,000 and $60,000 respectively if the world economy crashes.  BITCOIN to $100k. Saying for years gold&#38;silver GOD’S money. BITCOIN peoples $. Bad news IF stock &#38; bond market crash gold&#38;silver skyrocket. WORSE NEWS IF world economy crashes BC $1 million Gold $ 75K silver to $60k. SAVERS of FAKE US $ F’d. DEBT too high. Mom, Pop &#38; kids in… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) August 14, 2023 He explained that if the economy collapsed, the value of government-issued currencies would drop drastically. As people lose faith in fiat money, many would turn to Bitcoin and precious metals as an alternative store of value. The increased demand, coupled with the limited supply of Bitcoin, would cause the price to skyrocket. Earlier this year, Kiyosaki made a similar claim regarding Bitcoin, touting a price of $500,000 for each Bitcoin by 2025. Michael Saylor, another big name in the finance sector, predicted a similar price of $1 million for BTC in the next few years. What Is The Basis For The $1 Million Bitcoin Price Prediction? Kiyosaki&#8217;s recent predictions about the US dollar, in particular, have come on the heels of the BRICS alliance, which is now gaining traction. BRICS, which is an alliance between the emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, has gained ground in its campaign to support the reduction of transactions in the US dollar and the promotion of trading and settlement in local currencies.  As a result, many names in finance have seen this as a plan to de-dollarize trades in the BRICS countries, with reports of Saudi Arabia and possibly Mexico and Japan joining them. Reports are also that the BRICS alliance is working on creating a new currency backed by gold to settle global trades.  Related Reading: BALD Deployer Moves Proceeds Of The Rug From Base To Ethereum According to Kiyosaki, the only saving grace for everyday investors is to get into real gold, silver, and Bitcoin as stores of value. “SAVERS of FAKE US $ F’d,” Kiyosaki tweeted.

					<description><![CDATA[The Bitcoin price continues to compress around its current levels, but during today’s trading session, there was an uptick in volatility. The rise in this metric could hint at a shift in the narratives influencing BTC’s price action. Related Reading: Bitcoin Prediction: Crypto Analyst Forecasts New ATH by 2024 – Can It Happen? As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $29,300 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. In the previous seven days, the cryptocurrency saw similar action pushing other assets in a similar direction or no direction as the sector flatlines in the short term. Bitcoin ETF Becomes Dominant Narrative In Crypto Market? In a recent market update, crypto analysis firm Blofin pointed to an uptick in market sentiment. Coupled with a rise in volatility, market participants are reacting to the potential announcement from the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) around a spot Bitcoin ETF. The Commission is set to rule on asset manager Grayscale’s petition to transform their Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF. The decision was supposed to come out today, Blofin stated, but it could drag on until this Friday, August 18th. If the SEC postpones the decision for any reason, as it did with Ark’s petition, the market will likely keep moving sideways. In that sense, development around the ETF decision is gaining strength over macroeconomic dynamics. This change in dynamics is more evident in the derivatives sector, with options traders becoming more bullish for the coming months. Blofin noted the following on this dynamic: (…) The news above (on the Bitcoin ETF approval) has promoted the rapid rise of short-term bullish sentiment and uncertainty in the market (…). It appears that investors are waiting for good news related to the spot Bitcoin ETF. And “smart” traders are positioning accordingly. The report notes that the open interest for options contracts is skewed to the call (buy) side. Related Reading: XRP Price at Potentially Significant Turning Point, Key Support Nearby As data from the derivatives platform Deribit shows, traders are betting that the price of Bitcoin will rise above $30,000 by the end of August or September. As seen on the chart below, 57,000 contracts will expire by the end of this month and 90,700 next month. Coupled with the rise in Open Interest skewed to the call side, the chart above shows that traders are betting on a Bitcoin rally above $30,000 to $40,000. The spot BTC ETF decision will move the market, particularly at the end of August and September. Cover image from Unsplash, chart from Tradingview]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin price remains stagnant for going on months now, with no clear trend developing and volatility in a downward spiral. However, some subtle signs are popping up that could suggest that a bullish Bitcoin trend is beginning to take shape. Make Friends With Strong Trends “The trend is your friend” is one of the most famous trading quotes, highlighting how capturing as much of the prevailing trend as possible can lead to the most profitable results. For this reason, in technical analysis, trend-following tools are among the most successful. But what is an investor or trader to do when there is a clear absence of any discernible trend?

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin price remains stagnant for going on months now, with no clear trend developing and volatility in a downward spiral. However, some subtle signs are popping up that could suggest that a bullish Bitcoin trend is beginning to take shape.</p>
<h2>Make Friends With Strong Trends</h2>
<p>“The trend is your friend” is one of the most famous trading quotes, highlighting how capturing as much of the prevailing trend as possible can lead to the most profitable results.</p>
<p>For this reason, in technical analysis, trend-following tools are among the most successful. But what is an investor or trader to do when there is a clear absence of any discernible trend?</p>
<p>The answer is “to wait for the trend to appear” but that’s easier said than done. This is why specific tools have been created to tell when assets like Bitcoin or even stocks are trending or not. One such tool is starting to rise after several weeks of sideways price action, and it suggest that the underlying trend is strengthening.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Chiliz, the pioneering sports blockchain platform, is set to make waves once again as it teases forthcoming upgrades to its smart contracts. In a recent tweet, Chiliz unveiled its plans to enhance the functionality of its smart contracts, showcasing the company&#8217;s ongoing commitment to providing a seamless and efficient experience for its users.  Chiliz has been a trailblazer in the sports and entertainment industry, utilizing blockchain technology to bridge the gap between sports fans and their favorite teams.

Bitcoin: Co-Founder Labels BTC Maximalists As ‘Insecure Losers’ The platform&#8217;s innovative approach allows fans to engage with their chosen teams through fan tokens, gaining access to exclusive content, rewards, and even influencing certain team decisions through token-based voting systems.  🗳️ Upcoming Proposals: Upgrading the Smart contracts Upgrade 1: Upgrading the contracts to allow factory contracts to deploy without being whitelisted as deployers. The factory contract will still need to be deployed by a whitelisted deployer.#ChilizGovernance ⚡ $CHZ pic.twitter.com/zyBTqzAhTJ — Chiliz ($CHZ) &#8211; Powering Socios.com ⚡ (@Chiliz) August 14, 2023 As the platform gears up for these improvements, the question on everyone&#8217;s mind is whether these upgrades will play a role in boosting the price of CHZ, Chiliz&#8217;s native cryptocurrency. Chiliz Upgrades On The Horizon The first of the upcoming upgrades focuses on streamlining the deployment of factory contracts. In a bid to improve efficiency, Chiliz plans to enable such contracts to be deployed without the need for whitelisting as deployers.  This move is expected to simplify the process while maintaining a level of security by ensuring that the factory contract is still initiated by a whitelisted deployer. By reducing friction in the contract deployment process, Chiliz aims to enhance user experience and attract a wider range of participants. The second upgrade revolves around staking pool contract enhancements. Chiliz aims to address issues related to the accuracy of voting power displayed for validators and the calculation of delegated amounts.  Chiliz is currently trading at $0.0748. Chart by TradingView.com To rectify this, the Chiliz team has indicated that a temporary downtime for the delegated and undelegated features will be necessary during the upgrade. While this may temporarily inconvenience users, the improvements are anticipated to provide a more accurate and transparent staking experience. Impact On CHZ Price As Chiliz enthusiasts eagerly await these upgrades, the impact on the price of CHZ remains a topic of interest. At the time of writing, CHZ is in the red in all timeframes, and priced at $0.074903 according to CoinGecko. The past 24 hours have seen a decline of 1.2% in its value, while the past seven days have witnessed a decline of 1.5%. These fluctuations underscore the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. CHZ price action today.

					<description><![CDATA[The crypto finance world has witnessed numerous disputes, but few have been similar to that of the ongoing feud between DeFiance Capital and Three Arrows Capital Limited (3AC). Particularly, this dispute underscores the intricate interplay between traditional financial frameworks and the evolving dynamics of digital assets. In a tweet posted earlier today, DeFiance Capital CEO shed new light on their ongoing legal tussle with 3AC, suggesting a turn in the tide. Statement and Update on Dispute with Three Arrows Capital Limited (3AC) We are very pleased to share a positive development on our end with the public. It is well-known that for the past year, we have been locked in a dispute with the 3AC estate who are claiming that the assets… — Arthur (@Arthur_0x) August 15, 2023 DeFiance Capital: A Year-long Struggle Almost a year ago, the disagreement between DeFiance Capital and the 3AC estate took center stage when the estate contended that the assets held by DeFiance Capital should be used to square off the debts of 3AC. Related Reading: 3AC NFTs Sale To Commence Soon Due to Liquidation Countering this claim, DeFiance maintained that they had complete authority and rightful ownership of their assets. This stance, they assert, aligns with common industry perceptions and is supported by available evidence. The debate took a geographical turn when the liquidators insisted on settling the dispute in the British Virgin Islands (BVI). DeFiance Capital, which was managed from Singapore alongside 3AC, found this choice of jurisdiction puzzling. They argued that the primary evidence and witnesses were based in Singapore, making it a more apt location for the hearing. Their persistence bore fruit last week when the High Court of Singapore agreed to their jurisdiction preference, subtly undermining the liquidators&#8217; earlier narrative that DeFiance&#8217;s stance held no ground. The Road Ahead: Seeking Effective Resolutions Despite these disagreements, DeFiance has shown a willingness to collaborate. They have extended assistance to 3AC&#8217;s liquidators in understanding the position of DeFiance and even offered help in identifying 3AC&#8217;s assets. The intention, as expressed by the CEO &#38; CIO of DeFiance, was to minimize the resources spent on deciding the hearing location and instead concentrate on the core issues at hand. However, the journey hasn&#8217;t been without its hitches. The liquidators faced setbacks in the US while trying to hold Three Arrows Capital Co-Founder  Kyle Davies accountable in a US court. This effort was thwarted when it came to light that Davies was no longer a US citizen, an information oversight that resulted in unnecessary legal expenses. Blossom Hing, representing DeFiance, highlighted the significance of the recent jurisdiction decision. Emphasizing that the Singapore International Commercial Court could address issues pertaining to BVI law, she expressed optimism about an efficient resolution that benefits all parties. Related Reading: Crypto Hedge Fund 3 Arrows Capital (3AC) Files For Bankruptcy Hing noted: We welcome the decision by the Singapore Court as it will ensure that important evidence located in Singapore would be available for the purposes of resolving the dispute in a just and efficient manner. Coupled with the fact that the Singapore International Commercial Court can hear arguments on and decide on BVI law issues, we believe that having the dispute heard in Singapore will result in considerable savings of costs and time for all parties.

					<description><![CDATA[PEPE surged remarkably in the past week posting gains of approximately 20%. The $0.0000011079 support level on the daily chart acted as a price pivot for the gains in the last few days, indicating an attempt to enter the buy zone.  PEPE&#8217;s previous attempts to break above the $0.0000015440 resistance zone between July 19-24 were unsuccessful. However, the bulls are in control, driving PEPE to attempt another break above the $0.0000015440 resistance.  Related Reading: US Prosecutors Accuse FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried Of Using $100M To Curry Political Favors The rally in the past 7-days indicates a momentum shift for PEPE to a more positive outlook as the bulls attempt to seize control again.  PEPE Bulls Forcing Another Rally, But Bears Still Active Price volatility is evident when comparing price data for PEPE on the daily, weekly, and monthly timeframes. It trades at $0.000001348 on August 15 with a 6.03% price drop in 24 hours, while it has dropped 17% on the monthly time frame.   However, PEPE shows a more positive outlook on the weekly timeframe, although traders must tread cautiously as a price drop remains a possibility due to volatility.  The Relative Strength Index (RSI) value is 55.71 in the neutral zone reflecting traders&#8217; indecision in the market. Also, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is rising above the signal line, confirming the return of the bulls.  However, the size of the candles indicates low trading activity despite the gains making the price action moving forward quite tricky. The close of the August 15 candle will bring confirmation of the next price direction.  PEPE Shows Resilient Above $0.00000120 As Whale Comes Onboard In recent days, there has been a resurgence in PEPE&#8217;s performance. This trend is attributable to substantial investments from prominent investors and a rise in social engagement. According to Lookonchain data, there is a significant surge in whale attention to the PEPE token. The data shows a whale spent $ 1 million to acquire 807 billion PEPE tokens at $0.000001239. This whale involvement will likely have positive impacts on the price of PEPE. Another instance of this type of Whale involvement occurred on August 7. A holder of PEPE tokens sold a substantial amount of 2.26 trillion tokens at the price of $0.000001121 per token.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>PEPE surged remarkably in the past week posting gains of approximately 20%. The $0.0000011079 support level on the daily chart acted as a price pivot for the gains in the last few days, indicating an attempt to enter the buy zone. </p>
<p>PEPE&#8217;s previous attempts to break above the $0.0000015440 resistance zone between July 19-24 were unsuccessful. However, the bulls are in control, driving PEPE to attempt another break above the $0.0000015440 resistance. </p>

<p>The rally in the past 7-days indicates a momentum shift for PEPE to a more positive outlook as the bulls attempt to seize control again. </p>

<h2>PEPE Bulls Forcing Another Rally, But Bears Still Active</h2>
<p>Price volatility is evident when comparing price data for PEPE on the daily, weekly, and monthly timeframes. It trades at $0.000001348 on August 15 with a 6.03% price drop in 24 hours, while it has dropped 17% on the monthly time frame.  </p>
<p>However, PEPE shows a more positive outlook on the weekly timeframe, although traders must tread cautiously as a price drop remains a possibility due to volatility. </p>
<p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) value is 55.71 in the neutral zone reflecting traders&#8217; indecision in the market. Also, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is rising above the signal line, confirming the return of the bulls. </p>
<p>However, the size of the candles indicates low trading activity despite the gains making the price action moving forward quite tricky. The close of the August 15 candle will bring confirmation of the next price direction. </p>
<h2>PEPE Shows Resilient Above $0.00000120 As Whale Comes Onboard</h2>
<p>In recent days, there has been a resurgence in PEPE&#8217;s performance. This trend is attributable to substantial investments from prominent investors and a rise in social engagement. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1689098811057315840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1689098811057315840%7Ctwgr%5E258a528bb00d37a60bd05f067271f7af09c2a05c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.analyticsinsight.net%2Fpepe-price-prediction-pepe-displays-strength-above-0-00000121-is-a-rebound-on-the-radar%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lookonchain</a> data, there is a significant surge in whale attention to the PEPE token.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hedera (HBAR) has stolen the limelight by becoming the highest-gaining cryptocurrency in the past 24 hours. As investors eagerly accumulate, the token&#8217;s price exhibits a roller-coaster ride of volatility. While optimism fuels the anticipation of a price rally, caution is advised as HBAR&#8217;s Bollinger Bands cast a shadow of uncertainty over its immediate future. At the time of writing, HBAR&#8217;s price is recorded at $0.071 according to CoinGecko, reflecting an 8.1% rally over the past 24 hours. Impressively, the token has experienced a seven-day surge of 21.3%, underlining its significance in the market&#8217;s recent performance. Hedera price action today.

					<description><![CDATA[The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has unveiled the features of a new regulatory framework aimed at ensuring a high degree of stability for stablecoins in the country. This is the outcome of the central bank’s public consultation, which commenced in October 2022. Feedback from this public consultation was considered during the design of this new set of stablecoin rules in Singapore. According to MAS, these rules will apply to single-currency stablecoins (SCS) pegged to the Singapore dollar or any G10 currency &#8211; including the US dollar. MAS Releases “Key Requirements” For Stablecoin Issuers In Singapore In a media release published on Tuesday, August 15, the Monetary Authority of Singapore outlined key requirements for issuers of single-currency stablecoins in the country. The new regulatory framework for stablecoins consists of various provisions relating to value stability, base capital, redemption timeframes, and disclosure. Related Reading: US Congresswoman Raises Concerns About Paypal Stablecoin In The Absence Of Regulation The central bank stated that reserve assets &#8211; of a stablecoin &#8211; will be subject to requirements relating to their composition, valuation, custody, and audit, to give a high level of assurance on value stability.  Meanwhile, issuers are required to maintain minimum base capital and liquid assets to lower the risk of bankruptcy. This is to also facilitate an “orderly wind-down” of business &#8211; if the need arises. Additionally, SCS issuers in Singapore must refund the equivalent value of the stablecoins to holders within five business days after a redemption request is submitted.  Finally, the Monetary Authority of Singapore has mandated all stablecoin companies to provide appropriate disclosures to their users. Some of the information they are expected to disclose to their customers include SCS’ value stabilizing mechanism, the rights of SCS holders, and the audit results of reserve assets. The MAS noted that only issuers that fulfill all requirements under this new regulatory framework can apply for their stablecoins to be recognized as “MAS-regulated stablecoins.”  However, the financial regulator also warned issuers against misrepresenting their tokens as MAS-regulated stablecoins, as it may result in penalties under the revised stablecoin regulatory framework. MAS&#8217; Stablecoin Regulatory Framework &#8211; A Positive Sign For Global Adoption? In the press release, the MAS defined stablecoins as digital payment tokens designed to maintain a constant value against one of more specified fiat currencies. “When well-regulated to preserve such value stability, stablecoins can serve as a trusted medium of exchange to support innovation, including the “on-chain” purchase and sale of digital assets,” it added. Meanwhile, Ms. Ho Hern Shin, MAS’ deputy managing director, reacted to this development in a statement:  MAS’ stablecoin regulatory framework aims to facilitate the use of stablecoins as a credible digital medium of exchange and as a bridge between the fiat and digital asset ecosystems. We encourage SCS issuers who would like their stablecoins recognized as “MAS-regulated stablecoins” to make early preparations for compliance. Taking these statements into account, this new regulatory framework represents a positive attitude by the Singaporean authorities towards the use of stablecoin as a trusted means of payment. Moreover, it is expected to provide the needed clarity for stablecoin companies to operate in the country. It is worth mentioning that Singapore is not the only country making positive strides in terms of stablecoin regulation. There have also been discussions on regulating these digital payment tokens in the United States. Related Reading: Can PayPal’s PYUSD Be Frozen In Your Wallet Like Tether’s USDT?

					<description><![CDATA[In today’s micro update from Capriole, founder Charles Edwards presented a compelling analysis that draws parallels between the current low volatility of Bitcoin and its historical behavior in 2016. With Bitcoin&#8217;s price stagnating around the $29,000 mark, experts are closely watching for signs of a potential bullish breakout. &#8220;Bitcoin’s price remains at $29K, in a sideways consolidation that has created one of the absolute lowest volatility periods in Bitcoin’s 14 year history,&#8221; Edwards states. This prolonged period of low volatility is reminiscent of 2016, suggesting that a significant price movement could be imminent. Bitcoin Breakout Imminent? While the technicals indicate a bearish breakdown from the $30,000 mark, the absence of a downward momentum offers a glimmer of hope for bullish investors. &#8220;If price was going to collapse, we would usually have seen that follow through by now,&#8221; the report notes. However, for a more concrete bullish sentiment, &#8220;a close back above $30K on the daily timeframe is required at the minimum as a technical confirmation of a failed breakdown.&#8221; Related Reading: Bernstein Predicts Spot ETFs Could Claim 10% Of Bitcoin’s Market If Greenlit On the fundamental front, Bitcoin&#8217;s on-chain data continues to contract, albeit at a decelerating rate.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In today’s micro <a href="https://capriole.com/the-capriole-macro-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">update</a> from Capriole, founder Charles Edwards presented a compelling analysis that draws parallels between the current low volatility of Bitcoin and its historical behavior in 2016. With Bitcoin&#8217;s price stagnating around the $29,000 mark, experts are closely watching for signs of a potential bullish breakout.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bitcoin’s price remains at $29K, in a sideways consolidation that has created one of the absolute lowest volatility periods in Bitcoin’s 14 year history,&#8221; Edwards states. This prolonged period of low volatility is reminiscent of 2016, suggesting that a significant price movement could be imminent.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Breakout Imminent?</h2>
<p>While the technicals indicate a bearish breakdown from the $30,000 mark, the absence of a downward momentum offers a glimmer of hope for bullish investors. &#8220;If price was going to collapse, we would usually have seen that follow through by now,&#8221; the report notes. However, for a more concrete bullish sentiment, &#8220;a close back above $30K on the daily timeframe is required at the minimum as a technical confirmation of a failed breakdown.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the fundamental front, Bitcoin&#8217;s on-chain data continues to contract, albeit at a decelerating rate. The imminent decisions on <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/blackrock-first-spot-bitcoin-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">several</a> Bitcoin ETF approvals could potentially disrupt the current low volatility phase. &#8220;An approval could cause a break from the current low volatility range. Best not to pre-empt this though, as these decisions often get pushed. Confirmations are key to mitigate risk,&#8221; Edwards cautions.</p>
<p>Diving deeper into the technicals, the report highlighted two key observations:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Since 2010, Bitcoin’s historic volatility has only been lower than today in 2016. Suggesting a big price move is on the horizon when volatility expansion (reversion to the mean) occurs. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin’s $30K breakdown has (so far) failed to follow through&#8230; A close back into the Wyckoff structure at $30K would signify a failed breakdown and therefore be a very positive technical signal.</strong></p></blockquote>
