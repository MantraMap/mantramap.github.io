										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The Korean VXA has announced that it has issued a request to 12 domestic and commercial banks that have not contracted real-name deposit and withdrawal accounts with virtual asset exchanges.​​ </em></li>



<li><em>The request includes investigating real-name account contracts with virtual currency exchanges to ensure a fair trade order.</em></li>



<li><em>Previously, the agency sent letters to 5 banks that signed real-name account contracts with Korean virtual asset exchanges.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <em><a href="https://www.digitaltoday.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=479430" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Digital Today</a></em>, the Korean Virtual Assets Exchange Association (VXA) issued a notice to 12 domestic and commercial banks, local banks, and internet-only banks on the 20th that they had to sign real-name confirmation deposit and withdrawal account contracts with virtual asset exchanges.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1443-1024x684.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="684" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1443-1024x684.png" alt="Korean Requests 12 Banks To Provide Real Names Of Virtual Asset Partners" class="wp-image-196426" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1443-1024x684.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1443-300x200.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1443-768x513.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1443-750x501.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1443-1140x761.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1443.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Korean Requests 12 Banks To Provide Real Names Of Virtual Asset Partners 1"></a></figure></div>


<p>The request also asks for an investigation into real-name account contracts with virtual currency exchanges in order to guarantee fair trading orders and enhance consumer rights.</p>



<p>Earlier, on the 13th of this month, VXA wrote letters to five banks that signed real-name account contracts with Korean virtual asset exchanges, urging that banks do due diligence using the same criteria as current Korean won market exchanges.</p>



<p>According to reports, VXA is a consulting organization formed in January of this year by representatives of ten small and medium-sized encryption exchanges in South Korea, including FLATA EX, Flybit, BTX, ProBit, APRObit, Oasis, Huobi Korea, GDAC, and Beeblock, with the goal of jointly resolving the encryption market monopoly question.</p>

<p>Currently, Korea is tightening regulations related to virtual asset companies. As Coincu <a href="https://news.coincu.com/195023-south-korean-banks-limit-crypto-deposits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, the Korean Digital Asset Exchange Association (DAXA) and the five South Korean banks that provide real-name accounts to the country&#8217;s crypto exchanges will meet on June 15 to discuss &#8220;standardization of real-name account services.&#8221; Transfer limits, whether corporate banking should be allowed, and user deposit protection measures are all debated. The five banks are Nonghyup Bank, K Bank, Jeonbuk Bank, Kakao Bank, and Shinhan Bank.</p>

<p>In response to the considerable increase in associated crimes such as &#8216;virtual currency fraud,&#8217; the Seoul South District Prosecutor&#8217;s Office in South Korea <a href="https://news.coincu.com/195053-south-korean-prosecutors-kimchi-coin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">formed</a> a coin investigative group. The investigative team is a separate entity inside the Southern District Prosecutor&#8217;s Office&#8217;s Financial Securities Crime Unit, which is currently in charge of financial crime investigations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Today, Elon Musk lost one of the company&#8217;s top in-house attorneys.</em></li>



<li><em>Adam Gabor Mehes resigned and withdrew his attorney in Musk&#8217;s $258 billion lawsuit.</em></li>



<li><em>Despite repeated denials, Billionaire Tesla is in a lawsuit with allegations related to the Dogecoin (DOGE) market manipulation.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to Decrypt, according to documents filed in federal court today, Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk (Elon Musk) has lost one of the company&#8217;s main internal litigation attorneys.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1441.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1441-1024x576.png" alt="A Top Elon Musk Lawyer Leaves DOGE Price Manipulation Case" class="wp-image-196418" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1441-1024x576.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1441-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1441-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1441-750x422.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1441-1140x641.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1441.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="A Top Elon Musk Lawyer Leaves DOGE Price Manipulation Case 4"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Source: Decrypt</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Adam Gabor Mehes, an attorney on the verge of leaving, has signaled to withdraw his attorney in Musk&#8217;s $258 billion lawsuit related to the alleged Dogecoin (DOGE) market manipulation. It is reported that this lawyer has only been in office for less than a year and has actively participated in many legal proceedings related to Musk before.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Tesla&#8217;s legal team has applied to the court to invite their new attorney, Allison Huebert, who previously worked as a litigator at law firm Quinn Emanuel, in the DOGE market manipulation case.</p>



<p>Earlier in the news in June of this year, Musk denied the &#8220;Dogecoin whale&#8221; allegation. It is known that in June last year, Musk was also accused of manipulating the price of Dogecoin to the detriment of the interests of retail investors.</p>

<p>Musk has repeatedly <a href="https://news.coincu.com/191731-elon-musk-lawsuit-dogecoin-manipulation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">denied allegations</a> of market manipulation and insider trading related to the meme coin. A group of DOGE investors alleges he used his social media accounts to pump money after he appeared on NBC&#8217;s Saturday Night Live.</p>



<p>The Elon Musk&#8217;s lawyer also defended Musk&#8217;s tweets as innocuous, unable to affect the market. &#8220;There is nothing illegal about posting support on Twitter or sharing funny photos of a cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of nearly $10 billion. The court should end the plaintiff&#8217;s imagination and dismiss the claim complaint,&#8221; Musk&#8217;s lawyers wrote.</p>



<p>Last week, another lawyer for Musk, Alex Shapiro, denied allegations that the billionaire owns several digital wallets containing millions of dollars worth of Dogecoins.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[BNB has encountered considerable problems in the aftermath of recent lawsuits brought by the SEC against both Binance and Coinbase.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The lawsuits between the SEC and Binance have put significant pressure on BNB&#8217;s price performance.</em></li>



<li><em>Its $220 support is now consolidating.</em></li>



<li><em>According to the long-term trend, BNB is still not a good option as there are uncertain external factors.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Binance Coin (BNB), the Binance ecosystem&#8217;s native currency, has encountered considerable problems in the aftermath of recent lawsuits brought by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against both Binance and Coinbase. Although BNB was also subjected to regulatory pressure, it was able to establish some stability around the $220 support level.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1440.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1440-1024x683.png" alt="BNB Gains 10% In Value From The $220 Danger Zone, Should It Be Rated?" class="wp-image-196415" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1440-1024x683.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1440-300x200.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1440-768x512.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1440-750x500.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1440-1140x760.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1440.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="BNB Gains 10% In Value From The $220 Danger Zone, Should It Be Rated? 6"></a></figure></div>


<p>On June 10, the Binance Coin price decisively broke through the support trendline of a triangular formation that had been trending horizontally for about a year. This collapse must have freed the contained bearish momentum, setting the BNB price on a long-term decline. Each swing low established during the triangle formation might, in principle, serve as a key target for traders.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1439.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="539" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1439-1024x539.png" alt="BNB Gains 10% In Value From The $220 Danger Zone, Should It Be Rated?" class="wp-image-196414" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1439-1024x539.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1439-300x158.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1439-768x404.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1439-750x395.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1439.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="BNB Gains 10% In Value From The $220 Danger Zone, Should It Be Rated? 7"></a></figure></div>


<p>The $220 level represents multi-month support, which might prolong the probable decline and temporarily flip the BNB price sideways.</p>



<p>Currently, BNB is trading at $243, which doesn&#8217;t say much, while the important price points are the recently broken $262 confluence and the nearest psychological resistance, $250 (this is also the price of the 23.6 Fib).</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1437.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="623" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1437-1024x623.png" alt="BNB Gains 10% In Value From The $220 Danger Zone, Should It Be Rated?" class="wp-image-196405" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1437-1024x623.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1437-300x183.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1437-768x468.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1437-1536x935.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1437-2048x1247.png 2048w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1437-750x457.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1437-1140x694.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="BNB Gains 10% In Value From The $220 Danger Zone, Should It Be Rated? 8"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BNB price chart. <em>Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Regarding a deeper bearish scenario, it probably won&#8217;t happen in the near term, as if the $220 price zone is breached, then $200 would be a very strong support area, if not the last line of defense for the coin.</p>



<p>In terms of the current market overview, Bitcoin is nearing $27,000, bringing positive sentiment to the market, but the point is that currently, the money is pouring into BTC and not altcoins, so Binance Coin, too, is. There will be little momentum to break above the Fib 50 mark of $287.</p>



<p>Currently, in our assessment, BNB is still not a potential for short-term speculators, if not the potential risks when legal issues between the SEC and Binance is still going.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The new Mystic Stealer malware is increasingly being used in attacks with a rental fee of $150/month.</em></li>



<li><em>According to reports, it can quickly attack 40 browsers and 70 browser extensions, and crypto-wallets.</em></li>



<li><em>Its first version was released in April but was quickly upgraded to version 1.2 at the end of May.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A new information-stealing malware called &#8216;Mystic Stealer&#8217;, promoted on hacking forums and darknet markets since April 2023, quickly gained attention in the criminal community life by its devastation.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1434.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="610" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1434.png" alt="New Software Mystic Stealer Can Attack 40 Browsers And 70 Browser Extensions" class="wp-image-196392" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1434.png 1000w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1434-300x183.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1434-768x468.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1434-750x458.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" title="New Software Mystic Stealer Can Attack 40 Browsers And 70 Browser Extensions 9"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>This malware can target all versions of Windows, including XP to 11, supporting 32 and 64-bit operating system architectures. It doesn&#8217;t need any dependencies, so its traces on infected systems are minimal, while it works in memory to avoid detection by anti-virus products.</p>



<p>SlowMist&#8217;s Director of Information Security tweeted that a new crypto-stealing software, Mystic Stealer, appeared recently that could target 40 browsers, 70 browser extensions, and electronic wallets like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Binance, Rabby Wallet, OKX Wallet, OneKey, and other famous wallets are currently the most popular malware, be aware of the risks.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Besides, this software also targets 21 crypto apps, 9 MFA and password manager apps, 55 crypto browser extensions, Steam and Telegram logins, and more.</p>



<p>The Mystic Stealer reports, published almost simultaneously in a joint report between InQuest and Zscaler and a separate report by <a href="https://www.cyfirma.com/outofband/mystic-stealer-evolving-stealth-malware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyfirma</a>, warn of the emergence of new malware and its level of sophistication, and an increase in sales brought in many new online campaigns.</p>



<p>It is known that Mystic Stealer released version 1.0 at the end of April 2023 but was quickly upgraded to version 1.2 at the end of May, showing that the project is in active development. It is currently rented at $150/month.</p>

<p>The project also operates a Telegram channel (Mystic Stealer News) where development news, feature requests, and other related topics are discussed.</p>



<p>Reportedly, the creator of the new malware accepts feedback from long-standing members of the underground hacking community and openly invites them to share suggestions for improving Mystic.</p>

<p>Cyfirma reports that space veterans have verified the effectiveness of the malware and confirmed that although in its early development state, it is a powerful information stealer.</p>



<p>While the future of Mystic Stealer is still up for debate, given the volatile nature of illegal MaaS projects, its emergence signals an increased risk to users and organizations.</p>

<p>Bitcoin began last week in a fairly lethargic fashion, trading at around $26,000. All eyes were on the United States as the CPI data and the Fed&#8217;s next FOMC meeting, both of which were due to be revealed and held this week.</p>



<p>The inflation numbers, which were released on Wednesday, showed a small decrease. Yet, this had little impact on BTC&#8217;s price movement. On Thursday, the Federal Reserve, rather predictably, chose to stop its monetary strategy of rising interest rates.</p>



<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s dominance last approached 50% in June 2022, when the whole crypto market crashed due to consistently rising inflation in the United States, prompting the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy aggressively.</p>



<p>Interestingly, Bitcoin&#8217;s market domination has increased by more than 10.5% since November 27, 2022, owing mostly to investors seeking a safe haven in the aftermath of the FTX crisis and rising governmental scrutiny of crypto assets in the United States.</p>



<p>As Bitcoin fell substantially at the moment, currencies like Ethereum (ETH) fell even more precipitously, with the ETH/BTC pair plunging to a ratio of only 0.05.</p>



<p>BTC&#8217;s market valuation is a little more than $520 billion, but its dominance over altcoins is over 50%, the greatest level in over two years.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, BTC is trading at nearly $27,000.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Insolvent crypto firm FTX used $121.8 million to pay out lawsuits between February and April.</em></li>



<li><em>Of those, the law firm Sullivan &amp; Cromwell collected $37.6 million in fees for the period, representing 30.9% of total fees and expenses.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to information collated by The Block Research, FTX advisers&#8217; filings from June 15 indicate fees and costs between February 1 and April 30 totaling $121.8 million.</strong></h5>

<p>Of those, the law firm Sullivan &amp; Cromwell collected $37.6 million in fees for the period, representing 30.9% of total fees and expenses. Investment bank Jefferies charges as low as 0.6% of total fees and expenses.</p>



<p>Restructuring consultants at Alvarez and Marsel charged $37 million with over $1.1 million in expenses, including $51,225 in meals, $149,155 in accommodation, and other miscellaneous up to $1,995.</p>



<p>Rising costs due to the bankruptcy of FTX are prompting some old customers to <a href="https://news.coincu.com/182345-ftx-exchange-rebooted-tribe-capital/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">relaunch</a> the exchange under new leadership to bring value to customers. One potential option discussed is for FTX creditors to convert part of their holdings into shares in a reopened exchange.</p>



<p>FTX&#8217;s lead attorney said that if that route were to be taken, the plan would need to raise significant capital and said there had been internal debate over whether that funding should come from FTX real estate&#8217;s capital or third-party capital.</p>



<p>In an unexpected twist, FTX was able to return money to its customers thanks to an explosion of AI. According to financial tables reviewed by the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0c2a55b6-d34c-4685-8a8d-3c9628f1f185" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Financial Times</a> for 2022, FTX already owns a stake in AI startup Anthropic, which was worth around $500 million.</p>

<p>While it&#8217;s unclear if that specific number is accurate or the Anthropic market share it constitutes, the reality is that the business is currently valued at $4.6 billion &#8211; with the potential to soar due to the frenzy has taken over the industry after the boom started with the launch of ChatGPT 3.5 in the fall of 2022.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Jeffrey Huang chittered to refute the previous accusations made by on-chain detective ZachXBT.</em></li>



<li><em>He said ZachXBT&#8217;s allegations that he misappropriated funds were false and unsubstantiated.</em></li>



<li><em>In response to the accusation about &#8220;Squid DAO,&#8221; Huang Licheng stated that he did not push up or sell or have any improper behavior.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Jeffrey Huang, a tech entrepreneur, former musician, and one of the largest NFT Bored Ape Yacht Club holders, warbled to contradict the prior round of claims made by on-chain investigator ZachXBT.</strong></h5>

<p>He <a href="https://twitter.com/machibigbrother/status/1670819142050652160" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that ZachXBT&#8217;s charges of misappropriation of money were untrue and baseless. First and foremost, he did not steal 22,000 ETH from Formosa Financial. He has no access to the multisig that sends the vault ETH, and none of the receiving addresses are his. CEO Ryan Terriblini and CTO Lorne Lantz are multi-signatories for Formosa Finance.</p>

<p>Second, in 2020, he turned up Cream Finance to other teams before it was assaulted again in August and October 2021. In February 2022, he re-administered the protocol and recovered monies for users harmed by the hack.</p>



<p>Moreover, in response to the &#8220;Squid DAO&#8221; charge, Huang Licheng declared that he did not push up, sell, or engage in any unlawful activity. He is associated with Squid DAO. He backed a plan to refund DAO money in January 2022, resulting in the return of nearly 12,000 ETH to Squid DAO members.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>In a fresh development in the Ripple-SEC litigation, pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton contends that the SEC fails to apply the Howey Test to each transaction and that secondary XRP sales do not qualify as securities.</em></li>



<li><em>He cites the Second Circuit, stating that securities legislation does not apply when a purchaser intends to use or consume the acquired object.</em></li>



<li><em>The Ripple vs. SEC dispute, which has gone on for much too long, is anticipated to be resolved shortly.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a recent step in the continuing legal dispute between Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States (SEC), John Deaton, the founder of CryptoLaw and a pro-XRP lawyer, has made a bold remark hinting that the SEC cannot explain secondary XRP transactions as securities.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1420.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1420-1024x576.png" alt="Ripple vs. SEC Lawsuit: 2nd Circuit Of XRP Sales Are Not Securities" class="wp-image-196358" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1420-1024x576.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1420-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1420-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1420-1536x864.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1420-750x422.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1420-1140x641.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1420.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Ripple vs. SEC Lawsuit: 2nd Circuit Of XRP Sales Are Not Securities 20"></a></figure></div>


<p>Deaton provided a hypothetical scenario of a progressive migration of XRP as a form of payment from Ripple down to four other businesses in response to a Twitter post made by Marc Fagel, a former partner with the law firm of Gibson.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If an investment contract remained one in perpetuity it would nullify the common enterprise factor moving forward. <br>Hypothetical: <br><br>Ripple sells XRP to Johnny Crypto’s business who pays his employees in XRP.

</div></figure>



<p>He pointed out that secondary XRP sales are not securities. Additionally, the CryptoLaw founder cited the 2nd Circuit, which provides that securities legislation does not apply when a purchaser is motivated by a desire to utilize or consume the thing acquired.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1422.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1422-1024x768.png" alt="Ripple vs. SEC Lawsuit: 2nd Circuit Of XRP Sales Are Not Securities" class="wp-image-196360" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1422-1024x768.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1422-300x225.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1422-768x576.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1422-750x563.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1422-1140x855.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1422.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Ripple vs. SEC Lawsuit: 2nd Circuit Of XRP Sales Are Not Securities 21"></a></figure></div>


<p>Deaton has previously questioned SEC head Gary Gensler on the Howey Test and his attitude to crypto. According to him, Gensler has a different idea about how cryptocurrencies should be classed and regulated, which has caused him to deviate from the court&#8217;s definition of securities from 1946 in relation to the Howey Test.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1423.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="530" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1423.png" alt="Ripple vs. SEC Lawsuit: 2nd Circuit Of XRP Sales Are Not Securities" class="wp-image-196361" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1423.png 800w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1423-300x199.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1423-768x509.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1423-750x497.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" title="Ripple vs. SEC Lawsuit: 2nd Circuit Of XRP Sales Are Not Securities 22"></a></figure></div>


<p>A transaction is security, according to the Howey Test, if it is an investment of money in a common business with a reasonable expectation of benefit obtained from the labor of others. Deaton said that the four other businesses that acquired XRP tokens cannot logically be in the same business as Ripple Labs.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;If you don’t apply Howey at the time of each transaction and XRP is a security per se b/c Ripple sold to a guy named Johnny Crypto then, in effect, Johnny Crypto, his employee, the employee’s friend, Jeremy Hogan, Uphold, and TapJets are all in a common enterprise w/Ripple,&#8221; Deaton explained.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Ripple vs. SEC litigation concerning the selling of XRP as unregistered securities has dragged on far too long and should be resolved in the next months. The publishing of the Hinman speech, despite the regulator&#8217;s opposition, has proved to be a major changer in the ongoing case.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>CertiK uncovered a flaw in the freshly released Sui blockchain that threatened to shut down the network.</em></li>



<li><em>An infinite loop problem in the Sui code caused the blockchain&#8217;s nodes to run in an unending cycle, thus halting the network.</em></li>



<li><em>Sui received a $500,000 award for the crucial discovery.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Blockchain security company CertiK has <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/06/19/2690488/0/en/CertiK-is-Awarded-500K-Bounty-for-Discovery-of-Major-Security-Threat-on-Sui-Blockchain.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered</a> a vulnerability that could put Sui at risk of shutting down blockchain operations.</strong></h5>

<p>The &#8220;HamsterWheel&#8221; threat has the ability to interrupt the whole Sui Layer 1 chain. Unlike typical assaults that disrupt chains by crashing nodes, the HamsterWheel attack keeps all nodes operating indefinitely without processing new transactions as if they were on a hamster wheel. This method has the potential to paralyze large networks, essentially making them useless.</p>

<p>The security company disclosed this severe vulnerability to Sui before of their mainnet launch and got confirmation from Sui of the possible network damage caused by the HamsterWheel attack.

<p>After the fault was discovered, a team of engineers implemented two essential procedures that would lessen the possible effect of a similar issue in the future, according to the Sui Foundation.

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>XRP has formed a hard support area in line with the previously created bullish trend line.</em></li>



<li><em>The $0.5 price zone is a confluence between buyers and sellers, so investors need to pay attention.</em></li>



<li><em>Recent events between Ripple and the SEC make XRP a big bet.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>This week&#8217;s XRP price pullback found instant support at an ascending support trendline. Currently, this is a very good-performing altcoin if investors bet on it.</strong></h5>

<p>The SEC&#8217;s case against Ripple was one of the first significant legal fights in the crypto sector, but subsequent actions against Coinbase and Binance proved the regulatory agency is in for a protracted struggle with numerous firms.</p>



<p>It is widely assumed that the Ripple XRP litigation gets relevant since the court might set a precedent for other current crypto lawsuits. But, analysts caution that the SEC may claim that the Ripple litigation was isolated and had nothing to do with the broader crypto industry.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, XRP holders are awaiting the Summary Judgement from Judge Analisa Torres, who gave the Daubert motion judgment more than 100 days ago. Yet, the extended wait for the final decision has had little impact on the XRP price, as the currency remains in sixth place among prominent cryptocurrencies with a market worth of $25.5 billion.</p>



<p>Buyers recently pierced the immediate barrier of $0.456 and gained fresh footing to move higher. Besides, this is the confluence of the bracing price zone that preceded the sell-off of XRP, causing it to create a new low higher than the old low in February, or more specifically, a bullish trend line.</p>

<p>This dynamic support has helped purchasers maintain a persistent bullish trend over the last three months. Also, the lengthy lower price rejection candle on June 16th demonstrates purchasers soliciting this currency during troughs, suggesting a greater positive turnaround.</p>



<p>If the daily candle closes above the $0.5 barrier, the positive momentum will increase, and the rebound rally may continue to the $0.55 resistance. Therefore, it can be said that $0.5 is an important confluence between buying and selling that investors need to pay attention to.</p>
