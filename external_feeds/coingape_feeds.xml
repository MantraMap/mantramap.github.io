These lateral walks are some of the early signs of a trend reversal. Thus, the interested can grab these tokens at cheaper prices to maximize their gains in 2023.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uniswap(UNI)</span></h2>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/n/NY3K67YT.png" alt="TradingView Chart" /></strong>source- Tradingview</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Uniswap(UNI) token price has been under a sideways trend for nearly a year now. However, this consolidation in the weekly time frame chart showed the formation of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/symmetrical-triangle-pattern/">symmetrical triangel pattern</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In theory, this pattern provides a strong direction rally if prices break either of its converging trendlines. Furthermore, with the current uncertainty and negative sentiment in the market, the UNI price attempt a breakdown from the pattern’s support trendline. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the press time, the <a href="https://coingape.com/heres-how-much-your-100-investment-in-uniswap-will-be-worth-if-uni-reaches-40/">Uniswap token</a> trades at the $4.96 mark and is 88.94% down from the All-Time high of $44.97. Thus, a weekly candle closing below the trendline will replenish the bearish momentum and may prolong the downtrend to the $3 mark. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, if the price rejects the lower price, the UNI price will have a possibility for an upside breakout, which may push the prices to the $13 mark.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avalanche(AVAX</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/t/T0nvPm2q.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A V-top reversal from the $146.22 all-time high tumbled the Avalanche coin price 92.45% down to its current price of $11.1.however, the coin price follows a steady downtrend under the influence of a descending trendline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considering the falling price, the daily <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> moving sideways indicates a weakness in bearish momentum. This positive divergence increases the probability of a bullish reversal and breakout from the overhead trendline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A weekly candle closing above the trendline will accelerate the buying pressure and may surge the price&#8217;s $30 mark.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Chainlink(LINK)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/t/T5jVrVyT.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following its prior downfall, the <a href="https://coingape.com/heres-how-much-your-100-investment-in-chainlink-will-be-worth-if-link-reaches-10/">Chainlink price</a> has shifted sideways over the past seven months. Moreover, this consolidation phase has a formed range where the price continues to wobble between $9.5 and $5.6.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, this rectangle pattern holds the potential to offer a strong directional rally upon the breakout mentioned range.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The altcoin currently trades at the $5.6 mark, which is 89.35% down from the all-time high of $52.88.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, a weekly candle closing below $5.6 will prolong the prevailing downtrend to $3.3.</span></p>

Though the price gradually shifted sideways, indicating the buyers are wresting for trend control. Here are three reasons why you should invest in ADA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/l/leCTVkys.png" alt="Cardano" width="1946" height="1105" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cardano Price Turning Sideways</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ongoing downtrend in the <a href="https://coingape.com/cardano-ada-price-blast-past-3-in-the-upcoming-2023-bull-run/">Cardano coin</a> seems less steep than the downfall witnessed in from September 2021 to May 2022. Thus, the price action gradually turning sideways suggest decreasing bearish momentum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following a dramatic fall, the price shifting sideways is an early sign of trend reversal.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falling Using Resistance trendline.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cardano coin price has been falling for the last seven months under the influence of a descending trendline. The coin price has turned down from this dynamic resistance multiple times, indicating an established downtrend. However, even though the prices witnessed aggressive selling in response to the trendline, it also provides a technical setup for long entry opportunities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ADA price is expected to break the overhead trendline, projecting an early sign for price recovery. In an ideal condition, this post-breakout rally should drive the prices 167% higher to hit the $0.678 mark.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relative Strenght Index</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">Relative Strenght index(RSI)</a> defines the strength of current market trends by evaluating the speed and momentum of recent price action. Thus, while the ADA price is falling, the weekly-RSI slope is walking sideways, indicating weakness in selling pressure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, a bullish divergence in this indicator reflects an additional confirmation that the price broke the above-mentioned resistance trendline.</span></p>
<p><b>Current Price Action</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By press time, the Cardano price trades at $0.25, registering a 91.87% loss from the All time high of $3.10. However, with the ongoing uncertainty in the crypto market, the ADA price may struggle to carry sustained growth and witness prolonged correction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With sustained selling, the altcoin may plunge another 5% to retest the long-coming $0.24 support.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance Levels: $0.3 and $0.38</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support Levels: $0.24 and $0.187</span></li>
</ul>

According to court records released on Wednesday, the 30-year-old FTX founder is scheduled to be arraigned in Manhattan federal court on the afternoon of January 3, 2023, before U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan.</p>
<h2>SBF&#8217;s Plea For Not Guilty</h2>
<p>Prosecutors have accused Bankman-Fried of participating in a &#8220;fraud of epic proportions&#8221; over a period of years by utilizing customer deposits to maintain his <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/alameda-research/">Alameda Research</a>, a hedge fund under the FTX umbrella. The money has also been utilized to buy real estate, fund crypto media outlets and make political contributions.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the original judge in the case exempted herself, which led to the assignment of the case to Lewis Kaplan. The judge&#8217;s recusal after it was found that, her husband&#8217;s law firm had assisted the FTX <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">crypto exchange</a> prior to its collapse.</p>
<h2>Eight Counts Of Criminal Charges</h2>
<p>Bankman-Fried is accused of two charges of wire fraud and six counts of conspiracy, including conspiring to launder <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ftx-token/" rel="nofollow">money</a> and violate campaign finance laws. If found guilty, SBF stands the possibility of serving a significant amount of time behind bars.</p>
<p>On the contrary, Caroline Ellison, the former chief executive of Alameda, and Gary Wang, the former chief technical officer of FTX, have both agreed to cooperate with prosecutors after pleading guilty to their roles in the collapse of FTX. This was announced when SBF was being extradited to the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/united-states/">United States</a> on a private jet from the Bahamas.</p>
<p>On December 22, <a href="https://coingape.com/ftx-founder-sbf-released-on-250-mn-bond-placed-under-house-arrest/">Bankman-Fried was released on a $250 million bond</a> following his initial appearance in a federal court in Manhattan. Additionally, he was ordered to remain under house arrest at the Palo Alto residence where he lives with his parents; eminent Stanford University law professors Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried.</p>

However, the market leaders continuing to walk a sideway rally has also created a narrow range in both coins. This range formation offers a trading opportunity of its own and a suitable target in the near term.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Top Gainers and Losers</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-133414" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/28221348/Screenshot_20221228_220602.png" alt=" heatmap of cryptocurrency prices" width="1920" height="1080" />Source- Coin360 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the market shows a bearish outlook, the Internet Computer and BitDAO token is one of the few from the top 100 cryptocurrencies that have gained in the last 24 hours. Thus, the ICP price trades at $3.92 with an intraday gain of 1.41%, whereas the BIT price trades at $0.2828, gaining 0.72%. On the other hand, Chain and Terra Classic tokens show the highest loss, where the XCN price is down 12.47% to trade at $0.01299, and LUNC price is 11.91% down to $0.0001557.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-133413" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/28221257/Screenshot_20221228_220810.png" alt="btc" width="1738" height="518" />Source- Coinmarketcap</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past two months, the <a href="https://coingape.com/popular-crypto-analyst-predicts-bitcoin-btc-bull-run-in-2023/">Bitcoin price</a> has been wobbling between $16900 and $16200. The multiple short-body candles with long wicks on both sides indicate the market&#8217;s participant struggles with indecisiveness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, Bitcoin price can be considered to be trading in a narrow range, whose breakout will release a directional rally. Moreover, with the increasing uncertainty in the market, traders should avoid entering while this no-trading zone is intact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/f/ftaY1PZC.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, a possible bullish breakout from $16900 will accelerate the bullish momentum and surge the prices to the $18400 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, a daily candle closing below $16200 may prolong the bearish fall to $15600.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-133412" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/28221231/Screenshot_20221228_220842.png" alt="eth" width="1725" height="532" />Source- Coinmarketcap</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to Bitcoin, the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/3-reasons-why-ethereum-price-may-soar-in-2023-buy-now/">Ethereum price</a> has resonated between the $1230 and $1160 levels for the past two weeks. During this consolidation, the price showcased multiple attempts to breach the overhead resistance but failed to sustain higher prices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, either side breakout from this range will bring a sustained rally in this coin price. However, on December 27th, the ETH price turned down from the $1230 resistance and tumbled 3.5% in the last two days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/f/FI6Gn04x.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source-Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the selling pressure persists, the price will try to pierce the local support of $1160.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyways, a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/parallel-channel-pattern/">parallel channel pattern</a> is currently governing the ongoing downtrend in Ethereum price.</span></p>

The events that transpired during the year caught many investors off guard and made it significantly more difficult to forecast the price of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a>. However, there have been a few bullish assumptions made by leading crypto analysts after studying Bitcoin&#8217;s historical and technical metrics.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin (BTC) Bull Run In 2023?</h2>
<p>According to <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/AurelienOhayon/status/1607901375320522753" rel="nofollow">research</a> that was published on the 28th of December by Aurelien Ohayon, CEO of the strategic services platform XOR &#8212; it has been observed that Bitcoin&#8217;s previous bull runs have occurred after every four years. In this particular instance, he pointed out that the first <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bull-market/#:~:text=The%20bull%20market%2C%20also%20known,markets%20when%20prices%20rise%20up.">bull market</a> began in 2011, followed by another decline in 2014, which was followed by a rebound in 2015. In point of fact, following the crypto cold season of 2018, Ohayon pointed out that 2019 would form the base of another Bitcoin bull run.</p>

<p>Therefore, 2023 may serve as a foundation for the Bitcoin bull run if past trends are any indication. According to Ohayon&#8217;s study of Bitcoin&#8217;s technical data, bear markets run for no more than a year.</p>

<h2>$100K Bitcoin In 2024?</h2>
<p>There have been other reports as well, where a brighter picture has been painted for the world&#8217;s first decentralized coin. According to the data, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> researchers expect that the price will hit $100,000 in the vicinity of March of 2024, which is close to the time when the Bitcoin supply will be halved.</p>
<p>The next halving of Bitcoin&#8217;s supply is expected to take place at block number 840K and following the event, the block reward is expected to be lowered from 625 coins to 3,125 coins; a decrease of around one-third.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-133408" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/28203558/S7xz2k0f_548d5ea6d7f39df10ce98d47614af67a569204f6af4e526df49d668bc8a957741.png" alt="" width="1280" height="598" /></p>
<p>When looking at statistics from the past, analysts have discovered that the price of the world&#8217;s first cryptocurrency increased by 1,263% between the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin-halving-2/">Bitcoin halvings</a> that occurred in 2016 and 2020. If the current trends continue as they are, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) will reach $120,263 on the 23rd of March in 2024.</p>
<p>As things stand, the price of Bitcoin is presently being traded at $16,660. This represents a decrease of 1.09% on the day, with a further decline of 1.10% during the week as per crypto market tracker <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" rel="nofollow">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>

Thus, the price jump offered a breakout from a long-coming resistance trendline, offering a growth opportunity in the near term. However, the current downfall in LUNC price proved a retest-entry opportunity for interested traders.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A post-correction rally may surge the LUNC price by 28%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 50-day EMA slope act as a dynamics resistance to the LUNC price</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the LUNC coin is $235.5 Million, indicating a 9 % loss.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/7/7VG2debs.png" alt="Terra Classic Coin" width="1946" height="1105" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the stagnant market condition, the Terra Classic coin has shown <a href="https://coingape.com/terra-classic-community-passes-crucial-proposal-is-lunc-price-0-0005-next/">significant growth</a> over the last week. This bullish rally was backed by the growing burn activity and the launch of a new developer group, ‘Joint L1 Task Force,’ from Terra Classic’s core developers Edward Kim and Tobias “Zaradar” Anderson. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid this rally, the prices breached a series of resistances, such as a two-months long trendline, $0.00015, and $0.000165. This bullish breakout offered suitable support for buyers to prolong a recovery rally.</span></p>
<p>However, Binance, the world&#8217;s largest crypto exchange by volume, has <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-binance-suspends-terra-classic-lunc-burn-lunc-price-falls/">temporarily suspended</a> the Terra Classic’s burn mechanism. This announcement caused a negative impact on LUNC&#8217;s market value, and it tumbled 9% on the intraday level.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having said that, the decreasing volume in today’s red bar indicates a weakness in bearish momentum or a temporary pullback. The altcoin currently trades at the $0.000158 mark, and if the selling pressure persists, the prices may drop 4.3% down to $0.00015.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A retest to the $0.00015 may replenish the bullish momentum and resume the prior recovery. Thus, the price rally may rise 28% higher to reach the $0.0002 mark.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, a daily candle closing below the $0.00015 support will undermine the bullish thesis.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Technical Indicators</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Relative strength index:</strong> during the recent price jump, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">daily-RSI</a> slope climbed above the midline, indicating the market sentiment favoring a recovery rally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs:</strong> the 20-day EMA wavering at near the $0.00015 support provides an additional support level for buyers.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terra Classic Coin</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Price Intraday Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $0.000157</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bearish  </span></li>

<p>Bitcoin purchases by MicroStrategy have always been a bullish signal for the BTC price. However, Bitcoin price fails to show any significant move after the recent report.</p>
<h2>MicroStrategy Increases Bitcoin Holdings Amid Dip</h2>
<p>During the period between November 1 and December 21, MicroStrategy through its wholly-owned subsidiary MacroStrategy purchased 2,395 Bitcoins for about $42.8 million.</p>
<p>Moreover, <a href="https://coingape.com/microstrategy-sells-bitcoin-btc-for-first-time-this-reason/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MacroStrategy sold almost 704 bitcoins</a> for cash proceeds of $11.8 million, at an average price of almost $16,776 on December 22 for tax benefits. This was the first time MicroStrategy sold its Bitcoin. However, MacroStrategy acquired almost 810 bitcoins for almost $13.6 million in cash two days later on December 24.</p>
<p>Therefore, 132,500 Bitcoin held by MicroStrategy and its subsidiaries as of December 27, 2022 accounts for nearly $4.03 billion. This makes the average purchase price as $30,397 per Bitcoin.</p>
<p>In September, MicroStrategy reported its <a href="https://coingape.com/microstrategy-buys-more-bitcoin-amid-price-dump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">total Bitcoin holdings of 130,000 BTC</a>, after buying around 301 Bitcoins between August 2 to September 19, 2022. Also, the company sold $500 million of <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-bullish-microstrategy-files-sec-to-buy-btc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Class A MSTR shares</a> through investment banks Cowen &amp; Co. and BTIG LLC. The proceeds were used for “general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of bitcoin.”</p>

<h2>Can Bitcoin Price Rally Above $17,000 Now?</h2>
<p>Bitcoin price is currently trading at $16,700, down 1% in the last 24 hours. The 24-hour low and high for Bitcoin are $16,608 and $16,839, respectively.</p>

<h3 style="color: #252525">What is a Crypto Discord Server?</h3>

A server can have numerous channels, each specialising in a particular topic of interest. For example, most crypto servers feature channels for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/defi-decentralized-finance/">decentralised finance (DeFi)</a>, technical analysis, and trading signals.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Each server has its own culture and rules that members must adhere to. Any rulebreaker can be banned or kicked out by server administrators or staff members.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Some Discord servers are open to the public. However, the vast majority of cryptocurrency servers are private. These private servers are typically used to share exclusive information among members of a community.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">They influence members&#8217; cryptocurrency trading strategies in addition to keeping them updated with market conditions. They also have verification procedures to keep spammers out. These communities are among the 6.7 million servers that are active on this instant messaging service.</p>

Despite <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bear-market-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bear market</a> challenges, the industry has seen rising adoption, regulatory frameworks, and <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/web-3-0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Web3</a> developments. He expects the market will recover quickly, with more developments in the <a href="https://coingape.com/blog/what-is-metaverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">metaverse</a>, NFTs, DeFi, GameFi, and other blockchain solutions.</p>
<h2>Binance CEO Shares His Views On 2022 and 2023</h2>
<p>In an <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/from-cz/a-letter-from-our-ceo-2022-the-year-of-resilience-3832363980753069400" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">official blog</a> &#8220;A Letter From Our CEO: 2022, the Year of Resilience&#8221; on December 28, Binance CEO &#8220;CZ&#8221; shares his views on 2022 and what he expects in 2023.</p>
<p>2022 has mostly been a year defined by the crisis and failures of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/terra" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terra</a>, Celsius, Voyager, <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a>, and others. Crypto prices fell from their all-time highs, implosions that shook users and regulators&#8217; confidence, and <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FUD</a> due to increased scrutiny by policymakers, media, and the public.</p>
<p>However, CZ remains optimistic about developments, adoption, and regulatory frameworks seen this year. Brands are entering into the metaverse, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/nft-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFT</a>, blockchain, and crypto space. He sees demand for these and related fields rising in 2023 as the crypto market, stock markets, and global economy recovers.</p>
<p>Binance will primarily focus on building, regaining trust through transparency, and staying user-focused. Also, Binance CEO plans to expand to more countries and hire more employees, as well as, support Web3 and blockchain innovation.</p>
<h2>CZ Answered Community Questions</h2>
<p>Binance CEO answered community-submitted questions in a recent <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15-If80jvwI" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a>. Some questions were light-hearted, including whether he is the pseudonymous Bitcoin inventor <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/satoshi-nakamoto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Satoshi Nakamoto</a> and if he gets enough sleep.</p>
<p>He is really happy about the expansion of Binance in several countries and working with regulators. The crypto exchange has led the crypto market this year and helping boost crypto and Web3 adoption.</p>
<p>Commenting on whether will Binance collapse if users withdraw their funds at the same time, he said it will be completely fine. Binance has over 100% reserves on every single coin. Even if Binance goes bankrupt, customers&#8217; assets will be safe and &#8220;Trust Wallet is completely safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also answered how he would have managed the FTX-like situation and most valuable lessons learned this year. CZ is most optimistic about 2023.</p>

They are the makers of the well-known Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs, for allegedly forging &#8220;copycat&#8221; versions of their NFT collection.</p>
<h2><b>Yuga Labs filed a case in June</b></h2>
<p>In June, Yuga filed a lawsuit against Not Larva Labs founder Jeremy Cahen and artist Ryder Ripps. However, alleging that they had copied their NFT collections and undercut the value of the original Bored Ape products. The two have responded to the complaint, disputing many of the charges.</p>
<p>Yuga Labs claims in its court filing from Dec. 27,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Each of these NFTs is an entry on a decentralized digital ledger and entirely unique by design, making them both non-fungible and impossible to copy,”</p></blockquote>
<p>According to Ripps and Cahen, their version of the BAYC collection, dubbed RR/BAYC, does not violate Yuga Labs&#8217; copyright. Additionally, they assert that they &#8220;used conceptual art to critique hateful imagery&#8221; that Yuga Labs had been using.</p>
<p>Earlier in December, the United States District Court for the Central District of California denied the NFT maker&#8217;s motion to dismiss.</p>
<h3><b>NFT makers are also sued</b></h3>
<p>On a different front, BAYC is also being sued. A class-action lawsuit was filed by the California law firm Scott + Scott against Yuga. However, nearly 40 other people and businesses on the grounds that they participated in &#8220;a vast scheme&#8221; involving secret celebrity endorsements for goods like BAYC. A representative for Yuga refuted this.</p>
<h3><b>Why this case is important</b></h3>
<p>In cases involving NFTs, the Labs case emphasizes how crucial it is to comprehend the technology supporting IP claims. The court was able to determine that the digital assets pointed to by Ripps&#8217; RR/BAYC NFTs and Yuga Labs&#8217; BAYC NFTs were identical by looking under the hood. Due to this subtlety, the court correctly concluded that Ripps&#8217; NFTs were merely a collection of fakes and were not eligible for consideration as an artistic medium under the Rogers test.</p>

<p>Even as the effects of FTX&#8217;s implosion continue to be felt throughout the cryptosphere and beyond, Japan is loosening strenuous crypto regulations.</p>
<p>The government of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has included expanding the Web3 market in its economic strategy. He is probably going to reform corporation taxes next year to aid entrepreneurs in this sector. .</p>
<p>According to documents seen by Bloomberg, the body that regulates cryptocurrency exchanges informed member companies on 28 December, Wednesday of the new rule. The rule takes effect immediately and allows them to list coins without going through a time-consuming pre-screening unless the tokens are completely new to the Japanese market.</p>

<h2>Regulations in Japan</h2>
<p>Japan has one of the most sophisticated regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies. The Payment Services Act recognises <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> and other virtual assets as legitimate property (PSA). As a result of this legislation, cryptocurrency exchanges in Japan are required to register and adhere to standard <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">Anti Money Laundering</a>/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) obligations. In 2017, the National Tax Agency decided that cryptocurrency earnings should be treated as &#8220;miscellaneous income.&#8221; The buyers should be reimbursed accordingly.</p>
<h2>Regulations for Cryptocurrency Exchanges</h2>
<p>Japan permits exchanges, but after a string of high-profile hacks, including the 530 USD million digital currency crime known as the Coin check heist, crypto regulations have taken on national importance. The Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) has stepped up enforcement of trading and exchanges.</p>
<p>Regulations for cryptocurrency <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">exchanges</a> are evolving in Japan. In keeping with Japan&#8217;s progressive stance, only businesses with a highly qualified Financial Bureau are allowed to operate as cryptocurrency exchanges. This is under the PSA. International cryptocurrency exchanges are allowed to operate if they can demonstrate an equivalent registration standard in their host country.</p>

Both parties are done with submitting all the briefs regarding the Summary ruling. Meanwhile, XRP lawyer has announced dropping a prediction around the case ending.</p>
<h2>XRP lawsuit to end soon?</h2>
<p>John Deaton, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/amicus-curiae/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amicus Curiae</a> and XRP holders’ lawyer dropped a<a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1607900224705683456" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"> poll on Twitter</a> over the end result of the XRP lawsuit. In the poll, he gave out 2 options Settle or Goes to Verdict. Till now around 13k individuals have voted in the poll. However, 60% of them are looking out for the Settlement to happen in the XRP lawsuit.</p>
<p>XRP lawyer mentioned that he will be giving out his 2023 prediction when the poll ends. He added before drawing any conclusions on the XRP lawsuit, he will be reading some of Judge Torres’ other Summary Judgement rulings. This will help him to gain some more insights into Judge’s ruling.</p>
<p>However, Deaton claimed that Senator Jack Reed and his office refused to engage with the XRP holders which have been victimised by an overreach of the SEC. He asserted that the Senator was sitting on the Banking Committee and still refused to make basic inquiries to assist.</p>
<h2>SEC still protecting Hinman Docs</h2>
<p>The crucial XRP lawsuit is awaiting a Summary Judgement, meanwhile, the SEC has again brought up <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-lawsuit-news-can-sec-still-save-hinman-docs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Hinman emails</a> in its latest submission. However, the commission has already lost all its assertions over the speech related docs and emails.</p>
<p>The SEC has urged the court not to make the memos public as it believes that they would be “foreclosed” from making “such argument” in the future.</p>

According to the platform, more than $111.5 million represents approximately 222,187,500 1INCH or nearly 15% of its supply.</p>
<p>1INCH launched its token in December 2020, with only 6% released into general circulation. The network capped its total supply at 1.5 billion. The locked tokens would be released through vesting every two years until December 2024. The upcoming vesting on December 30 will be the second and final one for 2022.</p>
<p>According to <strong><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/1inch/" rel="nofollow">CoinMarketCap</a></strong>, there were approximately 780 million circulating tokens at the time of writing. At the moment, the locking contract holds approximately 780,840,748 1INCH. When the unlocking is complete, approximately 890 million 1INCH will be in circulation by January 2023, representing 59% of the network&#8217;s total supply.</p>
<h2>1INCH Token price to fall</h2>
<p>The most recent 1INCH token unlocking event took place in June of this year. During that time, the coin&#8217;s exchange price fell by more than 25%, from $0.81 to $0.60. According to reports, a whale deposited over 15 million 1INCH on <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a></strong> just days before the unlocking event in June.</p>
<p>On December 2, Etherscan reported that the same whale deposited over 15 million 1INCH. On December 2nd, prices fell by about 3% as a result of this recent deposit.</p>
<p>Lookonchain, an analytical <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/elon-musk/">Twitter</a> account, tweeted;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">1INCH Foundation transferred out 15.56M 1INCH ($8M) 18 hours ago, and transferred to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Binance?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Binance</a> 4 hours ago.</p>
<p>The last time <a href="https://twitter.com/1inch?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@1inch</a> transferred out 15.56M 1INCH was on June 9, when the price of 1INCH dropped from $0.81 to $0.6 within a week, a drop of 25%.<a href="https://t.co/b7KWe6yES8">https://t.co/b7KWe6yES8</a> <a href="https://t.co/ZpDjxh3kMj">pic.twitter.com/ZpDjxh3kMj</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a widespread belief that the coin will continue to fall as the vesting event approaches. However, representatives from the 1INCH network explained that the 15 million token transfer was not theirs.</p>
<p>The coin may experience further decline after vesting. When a large number of coins are added to the market at the same time, their number increases, outnumbering genuine demand and causing price inflation. This could immediately make 1INCH inflationary, causing it to lose more value.</p>
<h3>1INCH Price Analysis</h3>
<p>1INCH Network’s price today is $0.3891, with a market capitalization of $ 582 million and a 24-hour trading volume up by 61.33%. Now it stands at $18 million. At the same time, the circulating supply is approximately 780,840,748 1INCH</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-133357" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/28154100/1INCH_1D_graph_coinmarketcap.jpg" alt="source coinmarketcap" width="1161" height="500" /></p>
<h6>Source: Coinmarket</h6>
<p>Over the past 24 hours, the price of 1INCH has decreased by 4.46%, reaching $$0.3891, at the time of writing. Many people in the community are worried that the upcoming unlock will cause the DEX token to be dumped.</p>
