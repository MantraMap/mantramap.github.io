<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The Securities and Exchange Commission responds to Coinbase&#8217;s request for action on regulatory clarity.</em></li>



<li><em>Coinbase demanded federal courts to instruct the SEC to act and issue clear guidelines.</em></li>



<li><em>The SEC suggests that deliberating over significant changes sought by Coinbase takes time and it is particularly true given the Commission&#8217;s active regulatory and enforcement agenda in this area.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Coinbase filed a mandamus petition that urged the Securities and Exchange Commission to create clear regulatory guidelines for crypto exchanges and companies.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/SEC-Denies-Coinbase-Request-Crypto-Industry-Faces-Setback.webp"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/SEC-Denies-Coinbase-Request-Crypto-Industry-Faces-Setback-1024x768.webp" alt="SEC Denies Coinbase Request Crypto Industry Faces Setback" class="wp-image-187628" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/SEC-Denies-Coinbase-Request-Crypto-Industry-Faces-Setback-1024x768.webp 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/SEC-Denies-Coinbase-Request-Crypto-Industry-Faces-Setback-300x225.webp 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/SEC-Denies-Coinbase-Request-Crypto-Industry-Faces-Setback-768x576.webp 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/SEC-Denies-Coinbase-Request-Crypto-Industry-Faces-Setback-750x563.webp 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/SEC-Denies-Coinbase-Request-Crypto-Industry-Faces-Setback-1140x855.webp 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/SEC-Denies-Coinbase-Request-Crypto-Industry-Faces-Setback.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="SEC Denies Coinbase Request: Crypto Industry Faces Setback! 2"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The SEC has since responded to the complaint, stating that COIN has no right to mandamus, which is a court order that commands a government agency to carry out certain duties. In response, COIN has instead requested the court to compel the SEC to act on its rulemaking petition. However, the SEC argues that no statute requires the agency to take action on a specific timeline.</p>



<p>The agency also notes that it has only been a few months since COIN&#8217;s petition was filed, and even less time since the company supplemented the record. The SEC emphasizes that deliberating over the significant changes sought by Coinbase requires a considerable amount of time, especially considering the potential impact on both crypto assets and securities markets.</p>



<p>While the SEC has been actively enforcing regulations under Gary Gensler&#8217;s leadership, some proponents of the crypto industry argue that the agency has been particularly active. For instance, Kraken settled over its staking service after the SEC brought an action against the project. Nonetheless, Coinbase remains firm in its determination to press for regulatory clarity, given its available resources.</p>



<p>Coinbase initially filed its suit in response to a Wells Notice received in March 2023, which preceded formal regulatory enforcement action from the SEC. The Notice pertained to issues the agency found with the exchange&#8217;s Wallet and Prime services.</p>



<p>SEC concludes that Coinbase&#8217;s desire for immediate policy preferences does not entitle it to extraordinary relief ordering the Commission to act on a rulemaking petition that has been pending for less than a year.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Japanese officials claim G7 nations must take action against North Korean crypto hacks.</em></li>



<li><em>$721M worth of crypto stolen by North Korean hacker groups from Japan since 2017.</em></li>



<li><em>North Korean hackers also blamed for raids on Vietnamese, US and Hong Kong crypto sites and wallets.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to a recent report from Nikkei, a high-ranking official from the Japanese Ministry of Finance has expressed concern over the lack of action being taken to counter North Korea&#8217;s cyber attacks on the cryptocurrency industry. </strong></h5>

<p>The official noted that despite sanctions, North Korea is still able to continue its missile and other activities, thanks to its unjustifiable actions involving crypto assets, including the theft of tokens. As such, the Japanese government has called on other nations to follow its lead and take a more proactive approach to blocking North Korea&#8217;s cyber raids.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">North Korea is using cyberattacks to target Japanese cryptocurrency assets.<br><br>One study found that hacker groups have stolen $721 million from Japan since 2017, which is equal to 30% of the total of such losses worldwide.<a href="https://t.co/EkqUrpnJv9" target="_blank">https://t.co/EkqUrpnJv9</a></p>&mdash; Nikkei Asia (@NikkeiAsia) <a href="https://twitter.com/NikkeiAsia/status/1658030108727300096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 15, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>In a separate report, the blockchain analysis firm Elliptic has claimed that most of the crypto stolen by North Korean hackers has been taken from Japanese targets, with hacker groups affiliated with Korean government organs having stolen $721 million worth of crypto from Japan since 2017. This number is a staggering 8.8 times greater than the value of Korea&#8217;s exports in 2021, according to figures from the Japan External Trade Organization.</p>



<p>North Korean hackers have also been blamed for raids on Vietnamese crypto sites and wallets worth $540 million, and Elliptic has claimed that $497 million has been stolen from the United States. Hong Kong wallets and platforms have allegedly been raided to the tune of $281 million since 2017, according to the same report.</p>



<p>The situation is worrying, as the theft of tokens and other crypto assets represents a serious threat to the security and stability of the global financial system. As such, it is imperative that governments and other stakeholders take decisive action to prevent such cyber-attacks and safeguard the integrity of the cryptocurrency industry.</p>

<p>Optimism, a Layer 2 scaling platform for Ethereum, has announced a major upgrade to its mainnet called Bedrock, set for June 6. The upgrade will require two to four hours of downtime, during which transactions, deposits, and withdrawals will not be available. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>The upgrade will improve the security and resilience of the OP Mainnet bridge, and significantly cut fees. One of the upgrade&#8217;s key design goals is backward compatibility.</p>



<p>The upgrade will proceed as follows on upgrade day: Deposits and withdrawals on the legacy network will be paused. Transactions on the legacy sequencer will no longer be accepted. The smart contracts on L1 will be upgraded, and an irregular state transition on L2 will be performed. </p>



<p>The contract addresses, binaries, and data directories required to operate nodes on the new network will be distributed. After 2-4 hours, the Bedrock sequencer will start up, and deposits and withdrawals will be re-enabled. Backwards compatibility is one of the upgrade&#8217;s key design goals.</p>



<p>Optimism uses optimistic rollups, a technology that allows for bundling multiple transactions that are then recorded on the Ethereum blockchain in a single transaction. The network has around $863 million of locked assets on the platform. &#8220;Bedrock makes it easy to contribute to client diversity,&#8221; said the foundation, adding that additional information will be available on a mission control website.</p>

<p>Bedrock is designed with the most minimal diff on Ethereum possible. Ethereum equivalence + minimized complexity = less room for bugs, easier for ecosystem devs to contribute. The upgrade will significantly cut fees, improve security, and increase resilience.</p>

<p>Bitfarms mined 1,297 BTC in the first quarter of 2023, according to an <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1812477/000121390023039295/ea178185ex99-2_bitfarms.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEC filing</a>. Nevertheless, the corporation liquidated a significant portion of its holdings (1,267 BTC) to pay off equipment obligations. During the crypto winter last year, Bitfarms had to sell 3,000 BTC to obtain liquidity.</p>



<p>Bitfarms increased their hashrate from 4.5 EH/s to 4.8 EH/s by selling BTC and adding 3,000 additional miners. The miner said that it hopes to achieve the 6 EH/s target by the end of the third quarter, as compared to the earlier objective of 2023. At the conclusion of Q1, its hashrate was 5 EH/s. Nevertheless, the company earlier said that it would achieve 6 EH/s by the end of 2022.</p>



<p>Bitfarms&#8217; net loss per share was reduced to one cent from eight cents the previous quarter, while its gross mining margin increased to 42% from 33% the previous quarter. In the first quarter of 2022, its mining margin was 76%.</p>



<p>The miner recorded sales of $30 million in the first quarter of 2023, up from $27 million the previous quarter and $40 million the year before.</p>



<p>Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Geoff Morphy, who was hired in December 2022 after the resignation of founder Emiliano Grodzki, stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Focused on maintaining financial and operating discipline, we have built strength and flexibility to drive growth and accelerated our 6.0 EH/s target from the end of Q4 2023 to the end of Q3 2023.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For many months, the company has been collaborating with other miners to deleverage its financial sheet by selling Bitcoin and repaying debts. It warned in January that it could default on part of its loans.</p>



<p>Bitfarms is the owner and operator of blockchain farms, which fuel the worldwide, decentralized financial system. It gives computational power to cryptocurrency networks, including Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Dash, in exchange for fees from each network for securing and processing transactions.</p>

<p>Argentina&#8217;s Central Bank has announced that it will raise interest rates to 97% in an attempt to combat inflation.

<p>The Central Bank stated that it would continue to monitor the evolution of the general price level, the dynamics of financial and foreign exchange markets, and monetary aggregates to calibrate its rate policy.</p>

<p>Navitas Global is a private data center-building firm that uses years of expertise and strong ties in the Bitcoin mining company to give investors with favorable profits.</p>



<p>Navitas joins Project Dorothy 1B as an investor and equity partner in the proprietary mining joint venture. In return for 49% interest in Project Dorothy 1B, Navitas will contribute investment cash for the last phases of infrastructure development and 25 Megawatt of Bitcoin miners.</p>



<p>The agreement comprises a $2 million loan to finish construction of the 25 megawatts (MW) facility and a $12 million equity investment, according to a news statement issued by the firm on Monday. Soluna will offer operations and maintenance expertise while maintaining a 51% stake in the project. This collaboration, together with recent acquisitions at Project Dorothy 1A and Project Sophie, puts the firm on track to become cash flow positive in the second half of 2023.</p>



<p>Soluna Holdings CEO John Belizaire stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Navitas is a strong partner for Soluna now and long-term. The Navitas team not only understands the value of Bitcoin mining and having a reliable partner, but they also understand the long-term value of our infrastructure being interconnected to renewable energy power plants.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>After the announcement, the company&#8217;s stock climbed around 12% on Monday.</p>



<p>Following a protracted crypto winter in which cash dried up for miners, the sector seems to be reviving, with the price of Bitcoin almost doubling this year. The data center company&#8217;s stock has dropped over 20% this year, outperforming pure-play mining competitors and the Bitcoin price.</p>

<p>Tether has significantly <a href="https://tether.to/en/record-profits-reserve-surpluses-and-usdt-at-all-time-highs-a-look-at-tethers-q1-attestation/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://tether.to/en/record-profits-reserve-surpluses-and-usdt-at-all-time-highs-a-look-at-tethers-q1-attestation/" rel="noreferrer noopener">changed </a>its reserve strategy in the first quarter of 2023. The stablecoin reduced its bank deposits from $5.3 billion to $481 million, reducing Tether&#8217;s exposure to counterparty risk. This move was made as Tether&#8217;s competitors struggled with overexposure to bank deposits. </p>



<p>Tether&#8217;s bank deposits are spread over different banks, reducing the risk of bank failures. The company has added gold and bitcoin to its asset reserves for the first time, accounting for 4% and 1.8% of its total reserves, respectively. These changes are part of Tether&#8217;s commitment to transparency and stability.</p>



<p>Tether&#8217;s commitment to stability is also evident in its record net profits of $1.48 billion in Q1, which brought its reserves surplus to another record high of $2.44 billion. The company achieved these milestones while running a fully reserved stablecoin firm, unlike banks that use fractional reserves to boost profits. Tether can easily absorb any volatility, giving users added confidence.</p>



<p>Tether&#8217;s continued commitment to reducing secured loans indicates its focus on stability. The company has reduced secured loans in net and as a percentage of its reserves from 8.7% to 6.5%. Tether&#8217;s efficiency in margin calls and over-collateralization have prevented any losses on its loans, even during periods of industry crisis and high volatility.</p>



<p>Tether&#8217;s US Treasury holdings have reached an all-time high of over $53 billion, representing more than 64% of its total reserves. These treasuries and other reserves included in the Cash and Cash Equivalent category provide Tether with high-quality, liquid collateral that can be sold rapidly to process redemptions. Decade-high yield rates drive revenues up, increasing Tether&#8217;s surplus reserves and effectively overcollateralizing USD₮.</p>

</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to data from Arkham Intelligence, bankrupt crypto lender Celsius has begun staking Ethereum (ETH).</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-672.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="597" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-672-1024x597.png" alt="Bankrupt Crypto Lender Celsius Staked $75 Million Of ETH On Figment" class="wp-image-187587" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-672-1024x597.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-672-300x175.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-672-768x448.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-672-750x438.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-672-1140x665.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-672.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Bankrupt Crypto Lender Celsius Staked $75 Million Of ETH On Figment 24"></a></figure></div>


<p>Blockchain statistics showed that Celsius <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x341e607025c3d85e58059cf55f0bf596dffb095122640744afa1b1a69741e76a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">staked</a> nearly $75 million of ETH last week using Figment, an institutional-grade staking service.</p>



<p>According to Arkham <a href="https://t.co/jp1PJbN46r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">data</a>, Celsius sent around 40,928 ETH to a crypto wallet in fourteen transactions on May 10 and May 12. According to Ethereum blockchain explorer Etherscan, the account is held by Figment, who <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x341e607025c3d85e58059cf55f0bf596dffb095122640744afa1b1a69741e76a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">placed</a> the funds into staking contracts. Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21Co, <a href="https://twitter.com/tomwanhh/status/1657995466993446913" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> the Arkham claim.</p>

<p>The payment is one of the biggest financial transfers for the crypto lender since it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July.</p>



<p>While Celsius withdrew a portion of its staked ETH in April, the rationale for this deposit is still unclear. At the time, industry participants regarded this as an insolvent corporation consolidating its assets.</p>



<p>Celsius is still one of the largest corporations with an ETH portfolio. The lender has 410,378 ETH invested, according to the Arkham Intelligence dashboard.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, Celsius transactions are not unexpected considering that some organizations who withdrew their staked ETH have been re-staking it. According to Nansen&#8217;s dashboard, the liquid staking derivatives protocol Lido has dominated the charts in staked ETH withdrawals and deposits during the last two weeks.</p>



<p>Celsius was one of the crypto enterprises that went bankrupt after the abrupt collapse of blockchain project Terra and the ensuing crash of crypto markets a year ago, causing the company to halt customer withdrawals.</p>



<p>The bankruptcy court is organizing an auction to sell the company and its assets to prospective investors, including digital asset investment firm NovaWulf and private equity behemoth <a href="https://news.coincu.com/186088-apollo-is-attracted-by-celsiuss-bid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apollo Global Management</a>, as part of the restructuring process.</p>



<p>Celsius may receive incentives on its digital asset holdings by depositing to a staking service throughout the restructuring process. Figment has an average yearly staking reward of 5.6%.</p>



<p>Since withdrawals were authorized on April 12, the overall amount of ETH removed is 2.67 million, while the total number of ETH deposited is 3.46 million. According to Token Unlocks statistics, this equates to a net staking balance of 785,000 ETH.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The Lido Finance staking protocol has upgraded to version V2, allowing large ETH withdrawals after the Shanghai event.</em></li>



<li><em>The switch to V2 was approved by an on-chain vote, with community members discussing on the idea.</em></li>



<li><em>A total of 270,000 ETH staked will be opened for withdrawal without waiting too long.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Lido Finance, Ethereum&#8217;s biggest liquid staking platform, has updated to version 2 with a crucial feature that allows users to withdraw Ether from the site.</strong></h5>

<p>The upgrade to version 2 was approved by an on-chain vote after community members deliberated on the idea. The governance vote number <a href="https://vote.lido.fi/vote/156" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">156</a>, which was launched on May 12, was validated on the Aragon platform today.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Lido V2 is coming <a href="https://t.co/NwxShhblPw" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/NwxShhblPw</a></p>&mdash; Lido (@LidoFinance) <a href="https://twitter.com/LidoFinance/status/1658135422797586435?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 15, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>With the upgrade to V2, a total of 270,000 ETH staked will be opened and withdrawn without delay. The vault will continue to deliver ETH even after this ETH is emptied. According to Lido, this implies that investors will have a better probability of obtaining their ETH within the first three days after unlocking.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Around 2 hours ago, Lido enabled withdrawals from its stETH contract.<br><br>So far, ~3.6 ETH, or $7K, has been requested to be withdrawn.<br><br>We hope these unprecedented events do not have an adverse market impact <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f64f.png" alt="🙏" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/C9ewjnQOhi" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/C9ewjnQOhi</a></p>&mdash; Arkham (@ArkhamIntel) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArkhamIntel/status/1658154671071014938?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 15, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>At 1:15 p.m. EST today, the vote to approve the update was completed. The change comes on the heels of last month&#8217;s Shapella hard fork, which enabled staking validators to withdraw ether. Due to repeated security checks, Lido needs an additional month to permit withdrawals.</p>



<p>Lido Finance is a market leader in liquid staking solutions, with the total asset worth of investors reaching over $12 billion. After the Shanghai event, the protocol experienced an increase in ETH staking, hitting the 6 million ETH threshold.</p>



<p>The essential feature of Lido V2 allows liquid staking customers who own staked ETH (stETH) to withdraw from Lido at a 1:1 ratio. This advancement simplifies the mechanism by which anyone may join and depart Ethereum&#8217;s liquid staking.</p>



<p>stETH holders may now seek a withdrawal starting today. Upon the submission of the requests, an oracle will determine which Lido operators need exit validator nodes to fulfill the request. The operators will then send a validator exit request to an Ethereum mainnet consensus node. stETH holders may collect their ETH after the appropriate validators have gone.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/blockfi/Home-DocketInfo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">court documents</a>, the impending action follows a failed attempt to raise cash to repay creditors by selling the platform.</p>



<p>Fund recovery for customers and creditors of insolvent crypto lender will be mainly reliant on the firm&#8217;s claims against commercial counterparties such as FTX and Alameda, according to court documents dated Friday.</p>



<p><a href="https://news.coincu.com/186858-blockfi-customer-will-lose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BlockFi</a> said in its wind-down plan filed with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey that the success or failure of the lawsuit supporting these claims would make a difference in excess of $1 billion to customers who are waiting for their money back.</p>



<p>The plan also included a list of projected recoveries, including a $1.06 billion liquidation of BlockFi Inc. Interest Account Claims, a $216 million liquidation of BlockFi Lending LLC Private Client Account Claims, and a $371 million liquidation of BlockFi International Ltd. Private Client and Interest Account Claims, though actual recoveries received by clients may differ materially from projected figures.</p>



<p>After engaging with possible bidders to encourage a sale of its digital assets platform and around 660,000 client accounts since January, the business assessed that a sale might not yield substantial value for creditors. One factor for the lack of value-maximizing proposals from potential purchasers, according to the firm, was recent regulatory changes. According to its petition, BlockFi owes over $1.3 billion to its top 50 creditors.</p>



<p>With the failure of FTX, the crypto lender filed for bankruptcy protection in November of last year. It has now worked to sell off significant components of its corporate activities, including its bitcoin mining.</p>



<p>According to the May 12 filing, BlockFi might still seek an alternate arrangement, including the sale of all, or substantially all, of the debtor&#8217;s assets. Before the plan can be implemented, the bankruptcy court must first approve it.</p>
