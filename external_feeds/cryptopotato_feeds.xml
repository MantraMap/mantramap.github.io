			            <description><![CDATA[Binance chief executive Changpeng Zhao has alerted users of the latest crypto scam which attempts to dupe people into sending to the wrong address.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Aug. 2, Changpeng ‚ÄúCZ‚Äù Zhao said he wanted to ‚Äúshare this (luckily) unsuccessful, but very clever and close scam incident from yesterday.</p>
<p>It saved $20 million, he said before adding, ‚Äúhope it may also save you one day.‚Äù</p>
<p>Scammers are becoming more sophisticated, and their latest weapon is the generation of addresses with the same starting and ending letters. This is what most people check when making a transfer, CZ said.</p>

<h2>Crypto Address Scam Highlighted</h2>
<p>He added that some wallets hide the middle part of the address to make the UI look better. This plays to the advantage of the scammer.</p>
<p>The scammers use their newly generated address with the same starting and ending letters to send ‚Äòdust‚Äô to the victim‚Äôs wallet. Dust is the tiny fraction of a digital asset often left over in empty wallets.</p>
<p>Users make wrongly select this scam wallet to make a legitimate transaction since it now shows in the history and has the same beginning and ending as the legitimate target wallet.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou might just copy the wrong one. This is what happened yesterday to a very experienced crypto operator,‚Äù said CZ.</p>
<p>There was a happy ending to this scam attempt, however, as explained by CZ:</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúThe operator noticed the error right after the transaction, and we were able to request the USDT to be frozen in time.‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>He added that there is now a process that includes filing a police report to reclaim the funds back. ‚ÄúAt least, the funds won&#8217;t leave with the scammers,‚Äù he said before adding, ‚Äúfast reaction is key in these types of recovery.‚Äù</p>
<p>Some respondents to the tweet reported having lost funds to this type of scam. Meanwhile, others asked when Binance would support <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/how-an-old-ens-user-just-reclaimed-over-73-million/" data-wpel-link="internal">ENS</a> (Ethereum Name Service), which would eliminate the issue with fake crypto addresses.</p>
<h2>BNB Outlook</h2>
<p>The Binance native token has dropped 3% on the day to trade at $240 at the time of writing. However, the decline is not scam related, as broader crypto markets are <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-xrp-taps-0-7-bitcoin-btc-rejected-at-30k-after-1-5k-surge-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">retreating</a> again.</p>
<p>BNB has been pretty flat since it dumped in mid-June following the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/binance-lawyers-claim-gensler-offered-to-be-company-advisor/" data-wpel-link="internal">SEC lawsuit</a>. The asset has lost 22% since then and remains down 65% from its all-time high.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Litecoin's halving took place when the network reached transaction block 2,520,000.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Litecoin &#8211; one of the oldest blockchain protocols &#8211; completed the third halving in its history on August 2. The event, which occurs every four years, cut the miners&#8217; awards in half: from 12.5 LTC to 6.25 LTC.</p>
<p>Halvings are usually seen as catalysts that could propel price increases for the native token of the network in the long term. However, LTC headed in the opposite direction hours after the event, currently trading at approximately $86.80 (6% less than yesterday&#8217;s valuation).</p>
<ul>
<li>The team behind the protocol announced the news on Twitter. The event took place when the network reached block height 2,520,000.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">LITECOIN HAS SUCCESSFULLY HALVED ITS BLOCK REWARD!</p>

<ul>
<li>Created by Charlie Lee in 2011, Litecoin is among the first blockchain protocols. In technical details, its main characteristics are akin to Bitcoin. The leading blockchain protocol is often compared to &#8220;digital gold,&#8221; whereas Litecoin has earned the nickname &#8220;digital silver&#8221; due to its underlying similarities with the former.</li>
<li>As a result of the latest halving, the award for miners that process transactions and secure the network of Litecoin was cut in half to 6.25 LTC.</li>
<li>The blockchain protocol has a fixed supply cap of 84 million coins ever to exist.</li>
<li>Despite those long-term expectations, the price of the native asset of the network slumped in the hours after the disclosure.</li>
<li>Currently, it trades at almost $87 (a 6% decrease from yesterday&#8217;s valuation and 5% less than the figures one week ago).</li>
<li>This might as well be a temporary sell-the-news phenomenon.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[Hex had opened its first European office in Milan, Italy more than a year ago. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Popular digital asset custodian, Hex Trust, announced obtaining Digital Asset Service Provider (DASP) registration granted by Autorit√© des March√©s Financiers (AMF) and Autorit√© de Contr√¥le Prudentiel et de R√©solution (ACPR) in France.</p>
<p>The development comes amidst escalating regulatory tensions in the United States, which has prompted a number of crypto firms to strategically relocate or expand their operations to more promising jurisdictions in certain parts of Asia and Europe.</p>
<h2>Hex&#8217;s Expansion to France</h2>
<p>Hex Trust is originally based in Hong Kong, a city-state that has emerged as a crypto hub in recent years. But France&#8217;s expansion is yet another strategic step for the custodian as the country has been witnessing a significant surge in the entry of crypto firms.</p>
<p>In a statement, the company said that scoring this registration is a &#8220;significant milestone&#8221; for its broader European expansion plans as it could potentially expedite registrations and license procedures across the continent.</p>
<p>According to Hex&#8217;s official <a href="https://hextrust.com/resources-collection/hex-trust-receives-regulatory-approval-in-france-to-provide-digital-asset-custody-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">blog</a> post, the custodian will now be able to provide services such as digital asset custody, the purchase/sale of digital assets for legal tender, and the trading of digital assets against other digital assets for users in France.</p>
<p>Hex Trust&#8217;s CEO and co-founder, Alessio Quaglini, commented,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Receiving the DASP registration from a major EU Regulator is an important vote of confidence and demonstrates our commitment to Hex Trust‚Äôs ongoing expansion in Europe. The EU is a key market for Hex Trust, as we see strong growth potential and prepare for the European MiCA regulation, set up to regulate the digital asset industry in the region by 2024.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>France Welcoming Crypto Firms</h2>
<p>In sharp contrast with the hostile situation across the Atlantic, France welcomed crypto players looking to set their businesses outside. Just a day after the EU gave its final approval to a comprehensive set of regulations that have been curated to uniformly govern the crypto sector in the bloc, Beno√Æt de Juvigny, Secretary General of the Autorit√© des march√©s financiers (AMF) said,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If American players want to benefit, in the very short term, from the French regime, and from the start of 2025 from European arrangements, clearly, they are welcome. In France, we are proud to be pioneers.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In February, Bitstamp <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitstamp-secures-an-operational-license-in-france/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">secured</a> an operational license in the country.</p>
<p>More recently, Societe Generale&#8217;s digital asset venture, SG Forge, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/societe-generales-crypto-arm-becomes-first-entity-to-score-frances-dasp-license/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">became</a> the first crypto company to acquire a regulatory license approval as Digital Asset Service Provider from the French Financial Markets Authority (AMF).</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/binance-scores-first-european-regulatory-approval-in-france/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Binance</a> and <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/cryptocom-secures-regulatory-approval-in-france/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Crypto.com</a> also scored regulatory approval in the country.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The entity launched those features in the spring of last year, enabling users to manage digital assets and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).</span></p>

<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">GameStop&#8217;s Connection With FTX</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Besides offering digital asset wallets and launching an NFT trading platform, the gaming giant teamed up with the American subsidiary of the now-bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX in September 2022.

			            <description><![CDATA[Ordinals creator Casey Rodarmor will be one of the four board members of the new initiative. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Ordinals protocol team announced the launch of a non-profit organization, dubbed &#8216;Open Ordinals Institute,&#8217; to fund its open-source development.</p>
<p>The Open Ordinals Institute is a registered 501(c)(3) California-based public charity that will collect donations in Bitcoin to back the protocol‚Äôs development by funding its core group of developers.</p>
<p>The focus will also be on the creation of user-friendly tools to enable less technically proficient users to create Bitcoin Digital Artifacts with ease.</p>
<ul>
<li>According to the official <a href="https://ordinals.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">blog</a> post, the initiative also seeks to fund designers, reviewers, researchers, educators, and other contributors who play a vital role in improving and promoting the technology.</li>
<li>Previously, Casey Rodarmor, who is responsible for introducing inscriptions on Bitcoin‚Äôs mainnet for the first time, used to fund the project.</li>
<li>In addition to Rodarmor, Open Ordinals will consist of four team members serving the board, including the project‚Äôs pseudonymous lead maintainer Raph, Bitcoin-focused podcast host Erin Redwing, an anonymous Ordinals developer known as Ordinally.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Open Ordinals Institute is committed to supporting developers involved in this protocol, as well as those creating user-friendly tools that facilitate less technically proficient users to create Bitcoin Digital Artifacts.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The recently launched Ordinals.org site will be used to accept donations to the institute via two Bitcoin wallet addresses.</li>
<li>This year, the Ordinals protocol gained significant traction leaving the Bitcoin community divided over its viability.</li>
<li>The initial hype may have faded, but Bitcoin <a href="https://dune.com/dgtl_assets/bitcoin-ordinals-analysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">boasts</a> more than 21 million Ordinals inscriptions at writing time, representing a 40% <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/vitalik-buterin-lauds-bitcoin-ordinals-believes-brc-20-standard-could-revive-stagnancy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">increase</a> in less than a month.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[Grayscale‚Äôs lawsuit against the SEC remains the most likely route to approval, analysts say.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bloomberg ETF analysts have boosted their approval odds for a U.S. Bitcoin (BTC) spot ETF from 50% to 65%, in light of ‚Äúrecent events and new information.‚Äù</p>
<p>The analysts believe it is most likely that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will simultaneously approve all recent applications for the product after Grayscale defeats the agency in federal court.</p>
<h2>The ETF Approval Thesis</h2>
<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1686707919696568320" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">published</a> by analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balcunas to Bloomberg Terminal, a flurry of new developments make the approval seem close.</p>
<p>These include SEC chairman Gary Gensler‚Äôs ‚Äúdownplaying‚Äù of his role at the agency, and the regulator‚Äôs ‚Äú<a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sec-wanted-coinbase-to-delist-all-crypto-assets-except-bitcoin-before-lawsuit-ft/" data-wpel-link="internal">tacit approval</a>‚Äù of Coinbase as a Bitcoin exchange. Coinbase has been selected by an array of new applicants ‚Äì including BlackRock and Fidelity ‚Äì to form a surveillance-sharing agreement with relevant exchanges to help meet the SEC‚Äôs requirements for detecting BTC market manipulation.</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúPressure from BlackRock and possibly Democrats could make denying the ETF politically untenable for Gensler,‚Äù they added.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, Bloomberg highlighted Grayscale ‚Äì the owner of the world‚Äôs largest Bitcoin fund ‚Äì as its main source of optimism.</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúThe lynchpin for this current thesis is a Grayscale victory over the SEC in Federal court,‚Äù wrote Seyffart to Twitter on Wednesday. ‚ÄúWhich COULD set things up for a wave of SEC approvals sometime in the 4th quarter? All depends on how much Gensler wants to fight here.‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>Grayscale is fighting to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a Bitcoin spot ETF in court, by challenging the SEC‚Äôs prior denials of their attempts as ‚Äúarbitrary and capricious.‚Äù The firm maintains that its proposed surveillance-sharing partner ‚Äì CME Bitcoin Futures ‚Äì should be able to satisfy the agency‚Äôs requirements.</p>
<p>In fact, the company sent a <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/grayscale-claims-coinbase-wont-work-as-a-bitcoin-etf-surveillance-partner/" data-wpel-link="internal">letter</a> to the SEC last week arguing that none of the recent applicants partnering with Coinbase should be approved, based on the commission‚Äôs denial of applications with similar arrangements in the past.</p>
<p>If they do, Grayscale argued that the SEC must approve all ETF products at the same time ‚Äì including their own, for the sake of fairness.</p>
<h2>ETF Approval Deadlines</h2>
<p>The SEC‚Äôs first <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/heres-an-approximate-list-of-all-bitcoin-etf-approval-deadlines-bbg/" data-wpel-link="internal">deadline</a> to approve one of the recent ETF filings is on August 13 for the Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB). This deadline can be postponed until January 10, however, which Seyffart has previously acknowledged as a likely outcome.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Grayscale <a href="https://twitter.com/Grayscale/status/1686029477791305729" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">expects</a> to receive a decision in its lawsuit against the SEC before Fall 2023.</p>
<p>However, even if they win the case, some experts believe this may not lead to immediate approval for its conversion. &#8220;A ‚Äúwin‚Äù may just mean the court of appeals directs the SEC to revisit their decision,‚Äù said Joe Carlasare, a commercial litigator, to CryptoPotato last month.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Fitch claims there‚Äôs been an ‚Äúerosion of governance‚Äù on how to manage U.S. government debt, but the Treasury Department disagrees. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fitch Ratings ‚Äì one of the world‚Äôs ‚ÄúBig Three‚Äù credit rating agencies ‚Äì has removed the United States from its position among the very highest tier of long-term lending counterparties.</p>
<p>The nation‚Äôs Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) slid from AAA to AA+ on Tuesday, prompting criticisms against Fitch from both the U.S. Treasury Department and the White House.</p>
<h2>Why The Downgrade?</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.fitchratings.com/research/sovereigns/fitch-downgrades-united-states-long-term-ratings-to-aa-from-aaa-outlook-stable-01-08-2023" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Fitch</a>, the downgrade reflects expectations of ‚Äúfiscal deterioration,‚Äù the country‚Äôs ‚Äúgrowing general government debt burden,‚Äù and an ‚Äúerosion of governance‚Äù regarding how to manage that debt relative to its AA and AAA-rated peers.</p>
<p>Firstly, the government deficit has been rising over time and is expected to reach 6.3% by the end of 2023, versus 3.7% at the end of 2022. Fitch attributes the expected rise to ‚Äúweaker government revenues, new spending initiatives, and a higher interest burden.‚Äù</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúFitch forecasts a GG deficit of 6.6% of GDP in 2024 and a further widening to 6.9% of GDP in 2025,‚Äù the agency added.</p></blockquote>
<p>The sheer size of the nation‚Äôs debt also dwarfs nations within comparable credit rating categories. The United States‚Äô debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to reach 118% by 2025, which is nearly three times the AAA median of 39.3%.</p>
<p>As debt rises, so will the country‚Äôs <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/novogratz-advises-investors-to-buy-bitcoin-as-federal-interest-payments-skyrocket/" data-wpel-link="internal">interest burden</a>, which Fitch expects interest payments alone to comprise 3.6% of GDP by 2033.</p>
<p>So far, negotiations to address that debt have proven consistently chaotic in the United States over the past two decades. Fitch cited the bipartisan agreement in June, where Congress agreed to suspend the nation‚Äôs <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/what-would-happen-to-bitcoin-if-the-us-debt-ceiling-cracks-opinion/" data-wpel-link="internal">debt limit</a> entirely until January 2025 ‚Äì after the next federal election.</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúThe repeated debt-limit political standoffs and last-minute resolutions have eroded confidence in fiscal management,‚Äù wrote Fitch. ‚ÄúIn addition, the government lacks a medium-term fiscal framework, unlike most peers, and has a complex budgeting process.‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<h2>Government Responds</h2>
<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen was not pleased with Fitch‚Äôs downgrade, calling their decision ‚Äúarbitrary and based on outdated data.‚Äù She said she has seen progress in many economic indicators used by Fitch, ‚Äúincluding those related to governance.‚Äù</p>
<p>Meanwhile, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the downgrade ‚Äúdefies reality‚Äù in a Tuesday <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/08/01/statement-from-press-secretary-karine-jean-pierre-on-the-recent-decision-by-fitch-ratings/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">statement</a>, claiming that the President has ‚Äúled the strongest recovery of any major economy in the world,‚Äù and blamed Republicans for previously ‚Äúcheerleading‚Äù a debt default.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA["Detaining Mr. Bankman-Fried based on his communications with a reporter raises serious First Amendment concerns," the attorneys stated.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Cohen &amp; Gresser &#8211; an international law firm representing the former CEO of FTX Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) &#8211; maintained that he did not attempt to intimidate Caroline Ellison (ex-leader of Alameda Research) or taint the jury&#8217;s sentiment when talking to a New York Times reporter.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The 31-year-old, who faces several fraud charges and is accused of being the main culprit behind the collapse of the once-leading crypto exchange, shared quoted excerpts of Ellison&#8217;s private diary, revealing that her psychological condition was shaken prior to the catastrophe.¬†</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The US Department of Justice (DOJ) insisted on SBF&#8217;s detention and a bond revocation, maintaining that his actions could have tampered with the woman, who may be summoned as a witness at his trial set for the beginning of October.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Lawyers&#8217; Response¬†</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Mark Cohen and Christian Everdell &#8211; attorneys at Cohen &amp; Gresser &#8211;¬†</span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66631291/185/united-states-v-bankman-fried/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">sent</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> a letter to Judge Lewis Kaplan, requesting that their client Bankman-Fried should not be imprisoned for leaking information from Caroline Ellison&#8217;s diary.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The lawyers argued that SBF&#8217;s contact with the journalist was &#8220;a proper exercise of his rights to make fair comment on an article already in progress, for which the reporter already had alternate sources.&#8221; They also insisted that the defendant has a right to talk to the press about his case to protect his reputation &#8220;as long as the communications are not calculated to pervert the course of justice.&#8221;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;The Government&#8217;s proffered factual basis to revoke Mr. Bankman-Fried&#8217;s bail is extremely thin and relies heavily on assumptions, unsupported inferences, and innuendo. The Government recognizes that, even under its view of the facts, Mr. Bankman-Fried&#8217;s contact with the New York Times reporter by itself is not sufficient to justify detaining him,&#8221; the letter reads.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Subsequently, Cohen &amp; Gresser claimed that detaining SBF (as requested by the US DOJ) &#8220;would make it impossible for him to fully participate in his defense.&#8221; The firm reminded that federal prison inmates are not allowed Internet access, which &#8220;will cut off Mr. Bankman-Fried from key parts of the discovery entirely and render the rest effectively unreviewable.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Sharing data from Ellison&#8217;s private dairy (SBF&#8217;s ex-girlfriend) is just one of the many charges the former crypto tycoon faces.

She agreed to cooperate with the relevant authorities and is expected to participate as a witness during SBF&#8217;s mega trial starting on October 2.¬†</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Leaked Data</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The New York Times coverage (published last month)¬†</span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/20/technology/ftx-caroline-ellison-bankman-fried.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">revealed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">¬†that Ellison was &#8220;unhappy and overwhelmed&#8221; with her job months before the crash of FTX. She also told SBF that she had &#8220;significantly decreased&#8221; her excitement about Alameda Research due to the couple&#8217;s breakup. Ellison also questioned her capabilities as the leader of the entity.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The 28-year-old¬†</span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://nypost.com/2022/12/23/caroline-ellison-faced-110-years-behind-bars-before-plea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">faced</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">¬†a jail sentence of 101 years before agreeing to &#8220;cooperate fully&#8221; with the US authorities.

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In mid-July, Bitcoin attempted multiple times to break the significant resistance at $30K but ultimately failed and declined toward the 100-day moving average.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the price is currently trading within a critical range, and a breakout could trigger a substantial price movement.</p>
<h1>Technical Analysis</h1>
<p><strong>By <a href="http://twitter.com/Greatest_Trader" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Shayan</a></strong></p>
<h2>The Daily Chart</h2>
<p>On the daily chart, the 100-day moving average is acting as a support level, preventing further declines. However, it has been unable to push the price back above the $30K mark in the last few months.</p>
<p>Also, the prolonged divergence between the price and the RSI indicator suggests a possibility of a downside break, potentially pushing the price toward the 200-day moving average of around $27K.</p>
<p>The 200-day MA is a significant indicator that could act as support and propel the price higher, as it did back in February. Alternatively, if the price manages to climb back above the key $30K level, it may trigger a rally toward the $38K resistance zone in the upcoming weeks.</p>

<h2>The 4-Hour Chart</h2>
<p>On the 4-hour chart, the situation for BTC looks intriguing. Following the correction that began in early July, the price has reached the 0.5 and 0.618 Fibonacci retracement levels, which serve as crucial support and could potentially halt the recent downward spiral.</p>
<p>If the price finds support around this level, it is likely to enter a new bullish phase and surge higher. However, there is still a chance for a break below the price range between the 0.5 and 0.618 Fibonacci levels, which would be concerning.</p>
<p>In such a scenario, a breakdown might lead to a rapid decline toward the $25K support level in the short term.</p>

<h2>On-chain Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>By <a href="http://twitter.com/Greatest_Trader" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Shayan</a></strong></p>
<p>The &#8220;Exchange Whale Ratio&#8221; measures the proportion of the top 10 large inflows to the total inflows on a cryptocurrency exchange. High values of this ratio suggest that significant amounts of funds from large players, commonly referred to as &#8220;whales,&#8221; are being deposited into the exchange.</p>
<p>Currently, the Exchange Whale Ratio is at its lowest level, with the last instance of such low levels observed back in February 2018. When this ratio is low, it may not have an immediate impact, but historically, when it experiences a rebound, it tends to affect the price of Bitcoin (BTC) adversely.</p>
<p>For instance, in February 2018 and again in May 2021, when the ratio rebounded from an all-time low, the price of BTC reached its peak and subsequently started declining. This indicates that when the ratio increases, suggesting a surge in whale activity on exchanges, it could signal a potential downward trend in BTC&#8217;s price.</p>
<p>Since the fourth quarter of 2022, the Exchange Whale Ratio has been steadily declining, and during this period, there hasn&#8217;t been a significant drop in BTC&#8217;s price. However, it is essential to monitor this ratio closely as it could bounce back at any time, following historical patterns, potentially leading to changes in BTC&#8217;s price trajectory.</p>
