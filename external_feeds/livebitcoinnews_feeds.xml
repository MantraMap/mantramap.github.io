										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coinbase Borrow – the official lending protocol of Coinbase, one of America’s largest and most popular digital currency trading platforms – has <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/coinbase-to-stop-issuing-new-loans-via-coinbase-borrow/ar-AA1aIdBD" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">ceased all operations</a>.</p>
<h2>Coinbase Borrow Closes Its Doors Permanently</h2>
<p>The end for Coinbase Borrow arrived on May 10. This was the last day on which customers could take out loans. Those who received loans prior to the set date were told their financials wouldn’t be affected. This was simply the cut-off date for all new lending customers.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, despite the exchange being under heavy scrutiny from institutions like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the closing of Coinbase Borrow doesn’t appear to have anything to do with the company’s ongoing legal problems. A person allegedly familiar with the matter explained in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>We regularly evaluate our products to ensure we’re prioritizing the offerings that our customers care about most. Effective May 10, we will stop issuing new loans through Coinbase Borrow. There is no impact on customers’ outstanding loans, and no action is required from them [currently].</p></blockquote>
<p>Right now, many analysts are being forced to come up with their own conclusions and assumptions regarding the reasons for the closure. One can say, for example, that the borrowing and lending arena in the crypto world has been rather up and down over the past year, and thus Coinbase doesn’t want to take any chances.</p>
<p>For example, lending protocols such as <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/celsius-network-is-next-crypto-company-to-file-bankruptcy/" data-wpel-link="internal">Celsius</a> and <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/crypto-lender-voyager-digital-files-chapter-11-bankruptcy/" data-wpel-link="internal">Voyager Digital</a> have been forced to close their doors and enter bankruptcy proceedings as a means of protecting themselves against angry creditors who want their money back. <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/another-mega-bitcoin-crash-is-in-the-books/" data-wpel-link="internal">These institutions also halted</a> all withdrawals, thus cutting customers off from their hard-earned funds to ensure that they could at least remain relatively stable while they figured out their next steps.</p>
<p>The crypto industry is still reeling from the actions of 2022. While assets like bitcoin have experienced some degrees of healing since the start of 2023, there is still a lot of work to do, and a black cloud is still hanging over the heads of many crypto and blockchain institutions. It may be some time before everything is fully resolved.</p>
<p>Coinbase has been enduring several issues over the past few months. Not long ago, the company <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-receives-wells-notice-from-the-sec/" data-wpel-link="internal">received a Wells notice</a> from the SEC, informing executives that while charges hadn’t been filed against the company yet, these charges were likely to arrive relatively soon.</p>
<h2>Why Send Us This?</h2>
<p>Coinbase took serious issue with the Wells notice on account of the alleged fact that those in charge met with representatives of the SEC roughly 30 times over the course of nine years to ensure that they remained fully compliant with present securities and financial laws.</p>
<p>The SEC has arguably become one of the biggest crypto bullies around.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin endured a small dip in early May after it was <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/bitcoin-pulls-back-to-start-may-as-first-republic-bank-saga-comes-to-an-end/ar-AA1aBdVP" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">revealed the drama surrounding</a> First Republic Bank reached a new peak. Right now, the sentiment is that the bank could be the final monetary institution that crashes and burns following a long <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/analysts-provide-their-thoughts-on-latest-bitcoin-rally/" data-wpel-link="internal">streak of banks</a> that did the same. The streak includes names like Signature, Silvergate, and Silicon Valley.</p>
<h2>First Republic Bank Has Fallen</h2>
<p>Early last month, regulators acquired First Republic Bank and circulated most of its assets and deposits to institutions like JPMorgan Chase. This marks the third major bank failure this year, and it’s making a lot of people think the days of the 2008 Great Recession are on their way back.</p>
<p>Alex Thorn – head of firmwide research at Galaxy – commented in a recent interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s unclear whether the banking crisis narrative can continue to be a boon for bitcoin. Overall, the market lacks clear positive near-term catalysts, with supply issues overhanging bitcoin… Bitcoin accumulation by small addresses is outpacing issuance, and we expect Ethereum staking to increase, each of which provides a supportive supply narrative. Outside of crypto-native factors, we expect a back-of-the-year macro environment to be characterized by tightening, recession, and an expanding multipolarity in the global economy, all of which can be supportive of gold and bitcoin.</p></blockquote>
<p>The banking crisis in America and Europe has been two-fold in many ways. On the one hand, it’s put a lot of people in a state of fear that another big financial crisis like the one we witnessed 14 or 15 years ago is coming again. At the same time, it can be argued that the current baking crisis has brought about a new “safe haven” status for bitcoin and many of its digital cronies.</p>
<p>As a result, we are seeing currencies like bitcoin rise like they never did the previous year, and there are more people backing these assets, supporting them, and investing in them as a means of keeping their wealth stable during this present period of financial and economic strife. Thorn continued with:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin and ether started 2023 inorganically cheap, allowing for plenty of room to move higher off a low-base effect. A widening banking crisis became evident in March, and the contrast with bitcoin&#8217;s transparent and decentralized nature provided a further leg up for bitcoin, while Ethereum&#8217;s successful Shanghai upgrade provided a catalyst for Ethereum.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Trouble A-Brewing for Standard Banks</h2>
<p>First Republic Bank reached a <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-spikes-following-more-banking-troubles/" data-wpel-link="internal">troublesome point after</a> its stock shares fell by more than 80 percent over the course of just a few days. The dips had a lot to do with lagging deposits in Silicon Valley Bank.</p>
<p>That institution was “notoriously” tied to crypto, which is why so many regulators blamed the digital currency arena for the fall of the latter firm.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Fed recently made the decision to hike rates again, but the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/05/04/a-new-market-regime-the-fed-may-have-just-triggered-a-100-billion-bitcoin-price-boom-as-ethereum-surges-back/?sh=44dfaa1f5417" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">situation appears to be quite</a> different according to various bitcoin and crypto analysts.</p>
<h2>The Fed and Bitcoin: Working Off Each Other?</h2>
<p>This is the tenth hike instituted by the Fed over the past year or so, and many believe this could be the last one… at least for a while. They are certain that with the agency now stepping back and allowing things to cool down for a while, bitcoin is going to endure a humongous rally, and the world’s number one digital currency by market cap could wind up spiking to unprecedented levels in the coming months or weeks.</p>
<p>Markus Thielen – head of research at crypto services provider Matrix Port – said in a recent interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>While the Fed has raised interest rates by another 25 basis points, the probability that this was the last hike for this cycle is high, which could set up the market for another strong rally.</p></blockquote>
<p>The interesting thing is <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/is-the-fed-bitcoins-worst-enemy-right-now/" data-wpel-link="internal">that 2022 was a year in</a> which rate hikes were relatively constant, and they did little to nothing positive for bitcoin and its digital cronies. These assets repeatedly fell flat on their faces after rate hikes occurred, suggesting they were not the anti-inflation tools so many analysts and advocates had touted so many times before.</p>
<p>However, the Fed has already hiked rates a few times in 2023, and interestingly, bitcoin appears to be either unaffected after they occur, or the asset endures a small price jump that makes many people wonder if perhaps the asset is gaining maturity and learning to develop a thicker and stronger skin considering the ongoing financial debauchery.</p>
<p>Thielen further said:</p>
<blockquote><p>At the same time, we continuously see bank failure, which requires liquidity injections and guarantees from the government for any acquiring party.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lewis Harland – Decentral Park Capital’s portfolio manager – was also quick to throw his two cents into the mix, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>You see outperformance of bitcoin within the crypto market when regional bank share prices collapse. This signals that bitcoin is the high-quality, anti-dollar liquid play for investors as the crisis unfolds further. A break of 50 percent would likely signal a new market regime of prolonged bitcoin outperformance within the market.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Tim Draper Thinks BTC is Gonna Shoot Up</h2>
<p>Venture capitalist and bitcoin bull Tim Draper also <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/billionaire-investor-tim-draper-predicts-bitcoin-bull-market-says-controlling-government-is-killing-the-golden-goose-of-silicon-valley/ar-AA1aJUs4" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">believes bitcoin is going</a> to spike to new highs relatively soon. He recently commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>If the bear gets that angry to where the banks start falling apart, that actually means that bitcoin will have a bull market. It&#8217;ll be a raging bull in the middle of the bear… If they are regulating by enforcement, they&#8217;re just slapping people down and fining them and suing them. I don&#8217;t want to waste years of my life in court and trying to avoid some problem.</p></blockquote>

<li>EOS price started a fresh decline below the $0.80 level against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>The price is now trading below $0.750 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a short-term bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.675 on the 4-hour chart of the EOS/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair could continue to decline if it stays below the $0.675 and $0.750 resistance levels.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>EOS price is struggling below $0.80 against the US Dollar, unlike <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-could-rally-above-this-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a>. The price might attempt to recover if there is a clear move above $0.675.</em></p>
<h2>EOS Price Analysis</h2>
<p>In the past few days, EOS price saw a major decline from the $0.900 resistance against the US Dollar. The price traded below the $0.85 and $0.80 levels to move into a bearish zone.</p>
<p>The decline gained pace below the $0.750 level. It even spiked below $0.700. A low is formed near $0.6048 and the price is now consolidating losses. EOS is trading well below $0.80 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/eos-price-analysis-signs-of-fresh-increase-toward-0-95/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>.</p>
<p>On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $0.675 level. There is also a short-term bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.675 on the 4-hour chart of the EOS/USD pair. It is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.9040 swing high to the $0.6048 low.</p>
<p>The first major resistance is near the $0.75 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.9040 swing high to the $0.6048 low.</p>
<p>A clear move above the $0.75 level could start a steady increase toward the $0.78 level. The next major resistance might be $0.80. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.850 level. On the downside, immediate support is near $0.620.</p>
<p>The next key support is near the $0.600 level. If there is a downside break below the $0.600 support, the price could test the $0.550 support in the near term.</p>

<p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/EOSUSD/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="exclude">chart</a>, EOS price is now trading below the $0.80 level and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).

</ul>
<p><em>Litecoin price is struggling below $80 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-could-rally-above-this-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a>. LTC price could continue to decline if it stays below the $82 resistance zone.</em></p>
<h2>Litecoin Price Analysis</h2>
<p>In the past few days, there was a short-lived recovery in Bitcoin, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-eth-consolidates-below-key-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Ethereum</a>, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ripple-price-analysis-fresh-rally-possible-above-0-54/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Ripple</a>, and Litecoin against the US Dollar. Earlier, LTC settled below the $90 resistance zone to move into a bearish zone.</p>
<p>The price broke the $82 support zone and started a fresh decline. It even traded below the $80 support. A low is formed near $71.09 and the price is now consolidating losses. It is now trading below $78 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</p>
<p>There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $80.60 on the 4-hour chart of the LTC/USD pair. Immediate resistance is near the $75.60 level. It is close to the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $90.08 swing high to the $71.09 low.</p>
<p>The next major resistance is near the $80 level or the trend line. The trend line is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $90.08 swing high to the $71.09 low.</p>
<p>A clear move above the $80 level could pump the price toward the $82 level or even $85. The next major resistance could be $90.</p>
<p>On the downside, immediate support is near the $72 level. The next key support is near the $70 level. If there is a downside break below the $70 support, the price could accelerate lower toward the $65 level in the near term.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Crypto investor Balaji Srinivasan has <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/balaji-srinivasan-lost-1-million-in-a-bizarre-bitcoin-bet/ar-AA1aGG80" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">lost $1 million in a failed</a> digital currency bet.</p>
<h2>Balaji Srinivasan Is Forking Over $1 Million</h2>
<p>It was originally decided back in March of this year between Srinivasan and a pseudonymous figure on Twitter named James Medlock that a bitcoin bet was in order. Srinivasan said that with rising hyperinflation in the United States and abroad, bitcoin would become the new gold mine for investors and strike a $1 million price within a 90-day period. Clearly, the world’s number one digital currency by market cap is nowhere near this figure, and now he’s having to pay $1 million to the Medlock character.</p>
<p>Medlock explained in a recent interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>The joke itself was that, in the event of hyperinflation, the million dollars wouldn’t be worth very much anyways, so it was a no-lose situation, but hyperinflation is extremely rare, usually happening in times of conflict or institutional collapse. With the U.S. dollar being the global reserve currency and our institutions being relatively stable, hyperinflation today would be without precedent. In fact, a banking crisis might end up being deflationary, as the loss of deposits would reduce demand.</p></blockquote>
<p>To be fair, bitcoin has experienced a certain degree of healing since the bearish trends of 2022 took it to new lows. However, things have not jumped up in such a way that bitcoin is now the king of investment tools. Yes, there are many people who now view it more as a “safe haven” – <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/analysts-provide-their-thoughts-on-latest-bitcoin-rally/" data-wpel-link="internal">especially since several</a> banks in both the U.S. and Europe are crashing and burning – but the asset is nowhere near the $1 million point Srinivasan allegedly predicted it would be at.</p>
<p>Sadly, bitcoin is not even at the halfway mark of the $68,000 all-time high figure it achieved in November of 2021. Describing what he’d do with the money, Medlock explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ll pay off some debt, build a nice cat house for my neighborhood feral, and invest in a much better investment than BTC, namely low-fee index funds.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Many Have Predicted $1 Million for BTC</h2>
<p>There have been many figures over the past few years that have claimed bitcoin would hit $1 million or cross into seven-figure territory. One of the main ones was John McAfee, who <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/john-mcafee-1-million-for-btc-is-still-plausible/" data-wpel-link="internal">notoriously stated that he</a> would “eat his own d*ck” if bitcoin failed to reach $1 million by the year 2020. Obviously, this didn’t happen, and McAfee later <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/john-mcafee-walks-back-on-1-million-btc-prediction/" data-wpel-link="internal">claimed that his statements</a> had all been a joke (clearly a last-ditch attempt to retain his manhood).</p>
<p>However, several years later, Cathie Wood of Ark Invest fame was quick to mention that bitcoin would <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/cathie-wood-btc-will-be-priced-at-1-5-million-in-2030/" data-wpel-link="internal">undoubtedly strike either</a> $1 million or $1.5 million within a ten-year timeframe, and in all fairness, while $1 million is still a large number, ten years seems much more doable in the long run.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ron DeSantis – the republican governor of Florida – recently <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/ron-desantis-attacks-cbdc-defends-the-likes-of-bitcoin-they-don-t-like-crypto-because-they-can-t-control-it/ar-AA1aFcSf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">issued a statement defending</a> digital currency.</p>
<h2>Ron DeSantis is Clearly a Crypto Fan</h2>
<p>DeSantis has taken issue with the ongoing, anti-crypto agenda enforced by the Biden administration. He stated that one of the big reasons Biden and his fellow, nation-hating democrats want to finish crypto forever is because they cannot control the industry. In the statement, DeSantis explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>They don’t like crypto because they can’t control crypto. They want to get rid of crypto, which my view is if you want to invest in crypto, it’s up to you. You can do it. You can make those decisions.</p></blockquote>
<p>As of late, Biden – who was billed as being <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/opinion-there-is-no-biden-and-bitcoin-not-yet/" data-wpel-link="internal">the president that would</a> allegedly place bitcoin and all neighboring digital currencies on the financial map – has done everything he can to ensure the lives of crypto fans and traders are as difficult as possible. For example, in 2021 – his first year in office – Biden initiated a new <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/crypto-amendment-for-infrastructure-bill-leads-to-more-problems-and-infighting/" data-wpel-link="internal">infrastructure bill</a> that was secretly aimed at digital currency owners. They would be forced to report various digital currency transactions and their activities would likely come back to haunt them every April 15 beginning in the year 2024.</p>
<p>Biden has also worked to implement a <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/is-biden-using-an-obama-era-program-to-ban-btc/" data-wpel-link="internal">new Obama-era policy</a> that would prevent all crypto companies or businesses delving in blockchain from gaining access to traditional banking products (i.e., checking accounts) and services. Not long ago, he also <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/biden-wants-to-tax-crypto-mining-companies-at-30/" data-wpel-link="internal">proposed a 30 percent</a> tax on all crypto mining companies as a means of pushing environmental change in the U.S. and controlling the alleged emissions of these enterprises.</p>
<p>Continuing, DeSantis explained he’s also very much against the notion of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in that it would allow federal institutions and centralized banks to have more control over the financial activities of common people. He believes that crypto was built to help all users establish monetary independence and autonomy, and he doesn’t want them falling victim to the prying eyes of third parties and middlemen.</p>
<p>He was also quick to denounce the idea of a digital dollar created and issued by the federal government. This, he said, would give regulators far too much control and shut out everyday Americans who would be subjected to spying and rules detailing what they could and couldn’t do with the money they earned.</p>
<h2>Keep CBDCs Out of the Mix!</h2>
<p>He mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>The danger of the digital currency is that they want to make that the sole currency. They want to put everything in a central bank digital currency. I think that that’s fundamentally wrong, so we’re recognizing the dangers with this agenda.</p></blockquote>
<p>DeSantis is an avid crypto investor himself. Financial statements from the year 2018 suggest that he has invested in bitcoin, Ethereum, and bitcoin cash.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Popular digital currency exchange Coinbase is launching its Bermuda-based trading platform. After just a few weeks of teasing that it <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/coinbase-offshore-exchange-launches-this-week-with-bitcoin-and-ethereum-futures/ar-AA1aDjgD" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">had gotten the proper licensing</a> documents due to regulatory scrutiny in the U.S., the firm appears to be opening its international enterprise without delay.</p>
<h2>Coinbase Has Opened Its Int&#8217;l Exchange</h2>
<p>Known as the Coinbase International Exchange, the firm will allow customers not in America to trade in perpetual futures or products tied to the predicted future prices of commodities. Right now, these products are going to be purely bitcoin and Ethereum-based, though a spokesperson for the company has stated that this could potentially change in the future.</p>
<p>In a blog post, Coinbase said the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rest assured that Coinbase is committed to the U.S., but countries around the world are increasingly moving forward with responsible, crypto-forward regulatory frameworks to strategically position themselves as crypto hubs. We would like to see the U.S. take a similar approach.</p></blockquote>
<p>The company has been under the watchful eye of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the past several weeks. Not long ago, the federal financial agency sent the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-receives-wells-notice-from-the-sec/" data-wpel-link="internal">exchange a Wells notice</a>, meaning that while Coinbase had not been formally charged with a crime yet, such a charge was likely coming soon, and executives should prepare themselves for a legal fight.</p>
<p>Coinbase took serious issue with this notice given that it had allegedly met with various members of the SEC about 30 times or more over the past nine years to ensure the company was always in compliance. Coinbase has stated it does not know what it could possibly be charged with at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Also, the company is suing the SEC as a means of garnering a quick response to a survey it submitted to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-sues-sec-demands-answers-regarding-months-old-petition/" data-wpel-link="internal">the agency last July</a>. If the court rules in Coinbase’s favor, the SEC could finally decide if the crypto arena can and should be governed by present-day securities laws. The move is in reference to the lack of clear crypto regulation, which Coinbase believes the entire industry is suffering from.</p>
<p>The SEC has been a major bully to crypto and crypto companies as of late. Not long ago, the firm engaged in a lawsuit with leading America-based digital <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/is-the-sec-trying-to-kill-crypto-for-good/" data-wpel-link="internal">currency exchange Kraken</a>. The company was forced to part with $30 million in fees and end all its staking services and activities.</p>
<h2>Other Companies Moving Abroad</h2>
<p>Coinbase has said its new international trading platform (at first) will be utilized only by institutional investors and market makers. All trades will be settled in USDC, a leading popular stable currency that Coinbase helped develop with crypto firm Circle.</p>
<p>It appears Coinbase is not alone in its international ambitions. Gemini is learning from the company and is launching its own <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/05/02/gemini-launches-offshore-crypto-derivatives-platform/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">separate exchange</a> in Singapore.</p>

<li>Tron price started a fresh increase from the $0.0645 level against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>TRX price is now trading below $0.0750 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.0728 on the 4-hours chart (data feed via Kraken).</li>
<li>The pair could continue to move up if it breaks the $0.074 resistance zone.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>TRON price started a fresh increase above $0.0645 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-could-rally-above-this-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a>. TRX’s price could rise further if it clears the $0.074 resistance.</em></p>
<h2>Tron Price Analysis</h2>
<p>After a <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tron-trx-price-analysis-key-uptrend-support-intact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">downside correction</a>, Tron price found support near the $0.0645 zone against the US Dollar. TRX’s price formed a base and recently started a fresh increase from the $0.0646 low.</p>
<p>There was a break above the $0.0680 and $0.0700 levels. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.0856 swing high to the $0.0646 low. TRX is now trading below $0.075 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</p>
<p>On the upside, TRX is facing resistance near the $0.0725 level. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.0725 on the 4-hours chart.</p>
<p>The next major resistance is near the $0.074 level and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours). It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.0856 swing high to the $0.0646 low. A close above $0.074 could send the price toward the $0.0780 resistance zone.</p>
<p>Any more gains might send TRX price toward $0.080, above which the price could even rise toward $0.082. On the downside, initial support is near the $0.070 level. The next major support is now forming near $0.0682.</p>
<p>If there is a downside break below the $0.0682 support, the price might revisit the $0.0645 support. Any more losses might call for a move toward the $0.0620 zone in the near term.</p>
