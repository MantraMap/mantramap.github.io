										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Singapore, Singapore, May 3rd, 2023, Chainwire</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://zk.link/dunkirk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">zkLink</a>, a multi-chain trading middleware utilizing zero-knowledge proofs, announces the first &ldquo;Dunkirk Test&rdquo;, a new DeFi safety standard, on May 11-13. During this event, zkLink will shut down its servers for 72 hours, inviting users to try the emergency asset recovery feature, and earn rewards for taking part in the test.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Dunkirk Test is like a fire drill for crypto users. We will simulate a sudden shutdown of the zkLink infrastructure, so that users can learn how to recover their assets,&rdquo; said Vince Yang, co-founder of zkLink. &ldquo;We believe the &lsquo;Dunkirk Test&rsquo; could set a new benchmark for safety in the crypto industry. It is unacceptable that billions of dollars are lost each year due to custody fraud or cross-chain bridge exploits, so we encourage other DeFi protocols to conduct the same test to prove self-custody of user&rsquo;s funds.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Dunkirk shutdown period begins on May 11 at 12pm Singapore time, during which users can go to a recovery node and withdraw their assets back to their wallets.</p>
<p>One of zkLink&rsquo;s ecosystem dApps, ZKEX.com, will also take part in the shutdown test.</p>
<p>To participate in the Dunkirk event, users should first join the campaign on Galxe.com, then trade on the ZKEX.com testnet using free test tokens until May 10, the day before the shutdown.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The ZKEX team is building what we hope is the safest omni-chain DEX in the industry. So to prove it, we&rsquo;re joining zkLink in shutting down access to our trading platform to demonstrate users won&rsquo;t experience another CeFi-like loss with us,&rdquo; said Balal Khan, co-founder of ZKEX. &ldquo;Think of this as a fake rug pull with a happy ending, giving peace of mind that crypto traders have ownership and control of their assets at all times, even if zkLink is down, or ZKEX.com disappears.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition to fourteen partners hosting recovery nodes, zkLink&rsquo;s open-source asset recovery app has been released on Github, enabling anyone to download and run a private recovery node for fund withdrawal.</p>
<p>The mainnet launch of zkLink is planned for summer 2023, soon after the Dunkirk test.</p>
<p>For more information about the Dunkirk asset recovery test, visit <a href="https://zk.link/dunkirk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>zk.link/dunkirk</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>About zkLink</strong></p>
<p>zkLink is a multi-chain trading infrastructure secured with zk-SNARKS, empowering the next generation of decentralized trading products such as order book DEX, NFT marketplaces, among others.</p>
<p>By connecting various L1 blockchains and L2 networks, zkLink&rsquo;s unified, multi-purpose ZK-Rollup middleware enables developers and traders to leverage aggregated assets and liquidity from different chains and offer a seamless multi-chain trading experience, contributing to a more accessible and efficient DeFi ecosystem for all.</p>
<p><strong>About the &lsquo;Dunkirk Test&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>Inspired by the historic evacuation from the beaches of Dunkirk, the zkLink Dunkirk Test serves two critical purposes: boosting user confidence in zkLink system security and promoting the adoption of the Dunkirk Test as an industry standard for absolute fund security.</p>
<p>In this first test, the zkLink protocol will shut down for three days, allowing users to recover their assets from either a hosted or self-hosted recovery node. Asset balances will be rebuilt from all connected blockchains, and withdrawn back to users&rsquo; wallets, giving peace of mind that user funds are truly self-custodial.</p>
<p>A number of partners have committed to run recovery nodes for users during the Dunkirk shutdown period, namely Alliance DAO, Ascensive Assets, BitEye, Bware Labs, CyberConnect, Kepler-428 DAO, Meria, Morningstar Ventures, Republic Crypto, Secure3, Smrti Labs, TokenInsight, Unipass, and Verilog.</p>

<li dir="ltr">Litecoin creator Charlie is bullish on the LTC price.</li>
<li dir="ltr">In a Twitter thread on Tuesday, Lee said he sees the cryptocurrency as having lots of potential.</li>
<li dir="ltr">He noted that Litecoin was fairly launched and has had over 11 years of zero downtime.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/litecoin/"><u>Litecoin (LTC)</u></a> creator Charlie Lee says he sees the cryptocurrency as having value even as its price remains a fraction of <a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/"><u>Bitcoin (BTC)</u></a>, the pioneer asset that inspired what is often dubbed digital silver.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/1653298450824568833" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> early Tuesday, Lee highlighted what he says are undeniable pointers to Litecoin&rsquo;s key strengths. He sees Litecoin price gaining against <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/bitcoin/"><u>Bitcoin</u></a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>It&rsquo;s hard to deny there is value in Litecoin, a coin that has low fees, is protocol-compatible with Bitcoin, has the same game theoretical attack surfaces as Bitcoin, is secured with its own set of ASIC miners, is fairly launched, and has 11.5 years of history with zero downtime</em>,&rdquo; Lee noted.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Charlie Lee is bullish on Litecoin price</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Sharing his price outlook for LTC, Lee said he expects the digital silver to rally to new highs. He notes that the current market values Litecoin around 1% of Bitcoin, which is &ldquo;accurate.&rdquo; However, with &ldquo;a ton of potential&rdquo;, the altcoin could rally to 10% of BTC.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lee says the cryptocurrency&rsquo;s higher throughput, scalability, better fungibility and privacy are key features that could aid the coin&rsquo;s price.</p>
<p>According to him, going to 0.0125 BTC in the next bull cycle is possible. On the downside, the LTC creator gives a <a href="https://coinjournal.net/litecoin/price-prediction/"><u>Litecoin price prediction</u></a> of 0.0025 LTC/BTC.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The market currently values Litecoin at slightly over 1% of Bitcoin. Is that fair? I think the market is accurate today, but Litecoin has a ton of potential. It has a  higher throughput by design and scalability with extension blocks and better fungibility and privacy from MWEB.</p>
<p>&mdash; Charlie Lee &#9410;&#65039;&#128376;&#65039; (@SatoshiLite) <a href="https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/1653298453181796353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 2, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/litecoin/"><u>Litecoin</u></a> traded at around $89 on Tuesday 2 May 2023, roughly 2% up on the day against the US dollar. Meanwhile, it was changing hands at 0.00307886 BTC, with the LTC/BTC pair just 0.1% in the green.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">While Litecoin price reached its all-time high above $410 in May 2021, its gains paled in comparison to Bitcoin&rsquo;s rally to its all-time peak above $69,000.</p>

<li>Coinbase is a US-based crypto exchange.</li>
<li>The move comes amid a growing regulatory crackdown in the US for the cryptocurrency industry.</li>
<li>The new arm will allow users to trade perpetual futures, with initial contracts offering 5x leverage.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/coinbase/">Coinbase</a>, a leading cryptocurrency exchange in the United States, has launched an international cryptocurrency exchange as a response to the increasing crypto regulatory crackdown in the US.</p>
<p>The move is part of the exchange&rsquo;s strategy to execute &ldquo;the next chapter of the company&rsquo;s Go Deep, Go Broad global expansion strategy.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Eyeing the global market</h2>
<p>The Coinbase International Exchange will allow institutional users from eligible jurisdictions outside the US to trade perpetual futures.</p>
<p>In 2022, perpetual futures accounted for about 75% of global cryptocurrency trading. They created highly-liquid markets and offered traders additional versatility in their crypto trading strategies.</p>
<p>Coinbase in a <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/introducing-coinbase-international-exchange">blog</a> post stated:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Building out a global perpetual futures exchange for digital assets will help support an updating of the financial system by making Coinbase&rsquo;s trusted products and services more accessible to users of digital assets who live outside of the US. As more and more markets are moving forward with regulatory frameworks to become crypto hubs, we believe the moment is right to launch this international exchange.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Currently, the Coinbase International Exchange has listed <a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/what-is-bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> and <a href="https://coinjournal.net/ethereum/what-is-ethereum/">Ethereum (ETH)</a> perpetual futures contracts. The listed contracts initially offer up to 5x leverage.</p>

<li dir="ltr">The S&amp;P 500 was down 1.5% as two bank stocks plummeted.</li>
<li dir="ltr">BTC and ETH gains saw altcoins in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap up.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> price moved above $28,500 again on Tuesday, rising more than 2% in early morning trades during the US trading session. The upside was yet another attempt by Bitcoin bulls to establish a fresj footing in the key price range.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Elsewhere, the price of <a href="https://coinjournal.net/ethereum/">Ethereum (ETH)</a> rose above $1,860 to hit a new 24-hour high as crypto spot markets climbed. The Ether token was 1.9% up at the time of writing, gains that were being mirrored across the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap list.</p>
<p dir="ltr">BTC and ETH have traded to year-to-date highs above $31,000 and $2,100 respectively.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Stocks tank on bank fears</h2>
<p dir="ltr">US stocks opened lower on Tuesday as <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/stock-markets/">stock prices</a> of another two US banks plunged amid the latest turmoil in the banking sector. The S&amp;P 500 was down 1.5% while Nasdaq was shedding 1.3%.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After share prices of First Republic Bank fell in the lead up to its takeover by JPMorgan, Tuesday saw prices of Pacwest (PACW) and Western Alliance (WAL) stocks bleed massively.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At about 12:30 pm ET, the PACW and WAL share prices were down 26% and 20% respectively.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The two bank stocks had plummeted more than 30% earlier as investor concerns around the turbulence within the US banking system resurfaced following the losses that followed the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Also on investors&rsquo; minds this week is the Fed&rsquo;s meeting that kicked off on Tuesday. While the market has the anticipated 25bps interest rate hike baked in for after the FMC meeting, what the central bank says in relation to what next is seen as key.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Economist Mohamed A. El-Erian, commented on the market outlook, stating via a<a href="https://twitter.com/elerianm/status/1653438395002019844">&nbsp;<u>tweet</u></a>:</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>The roller coaster continues with, this time around, a 20 bps drop in the yield on 2-year Treasuries. &nbsp;With such a key market segment continuing to be in urgent need of stabilization, it remains to be seen if the Fed serves this function tomorrow or, instead, is again a source of volatility</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Barry Knapp of Ironsides Macroeconomics says the Fed&rsquo;s approach to the inflation question is fraught and dubious. The central bank has to consider what the market is telling it. He shared his views in an interview with CNBC&rsquo;s Squawk Box.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">"The whole 2% target is an absolute trap," says <a href="https://twitter.com/barryknapp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@barryknapp</a> on the Fed's inflation target.

<li>ByBit users will now be able to earn interest payouts on idle cryptocurrency assets.</li>
<li>The ByBit Lending will offer hourly paid interest and no deposit periods for redemptions and deposits.</li>
<li>The lending service will serve as an intermediary between borrowers and lenders.</li>
</ul>
<p>Popular <a href="https://coinjournal.net/compare/best-cryptocurrency-exchanges/">cryptocurrency exchange</a> ByBit has launched its lending service arm, ByBit Lending, which will allow users to earn high-interest payouts on their idle cryptocurrency assets.</p>
<p>The new product offers an additional way for users to capitalize on their crypto investments and generate passive income.</p>
<p>ByBit now joins the likes of <a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/binance/">Binance</a>, <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/okx-review-a-one-stop-platform-for-crypto-defi-dapps-nfts-and-gamefi/">OKX</a>, and <a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/kucoin/">KuCoin </a>in offering lending services. The US-based exchange Coinbase abandoned plans to launch lending services after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rendered the offering a security.</p>
<h2>Passive income opportunity for ByBit users</h2>
<p>ByBit Lending offers a high APR, offering users an opportunity to earn some passive income on the crypto assets they are holding instead of letting them sit idle on the exchange.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the interest on the crypto assets deposited for lending will be paid hourly with the users having the flexibility to deposit and redeem their assets at any time. This makes it easy for users to take advantage of the crypto market fluctuations.</p>
<p>The exchange has made the lending service accessible to both novice and experienced clients through a simple four-step process. The deposited assets will remain secure throughout the lending process, thanks to the exchange&rsquo;s advanced risk management systems.</p>
<p>Besides benefiting lenders, borrowers will also have the opportunity to take up crypto loans for various earning strategies including trading perpetual contracts and capitalizing on spreads on the ByBit Earn. Borrowers will, however, be required to deposit collateral equal to or greater than the loan they intend to take.</p>

<li dir="ltr">DigiToads (TOADS) presale is 83% sold out at current stage with a total of over $2.1 million raised.</li>
<li dir="ltr">TOADS demand is at new levels as the crypto space witnesses new trajectory in the meme coin sector.</li>
<li dir="ltr">DigiToads looks to be a promising investment opportunity, with a unique presale, gaming approach and deflationary mechanism.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The unanticipated blows the crypto market experienced in the last few months are enough to make any investor lose interest in what is considered &ldquo;one of the most promising industries.&rdquo; However, recent activity in the crypto space indicates this sector&rsquo;s possible revival.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">While the crypto market has seen a fair share of meme coins, <a href="https://digitoads.me/cjl" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>DigiToads</u></a> is a new utility token and platform that offers something unique within the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/altcoins/">altcoin market</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">A Look into DigiToads (TOADS)</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Investors looking for a potentially high-yield cryptocurrency to buy might find a good opportunity in DigiToads (TOADS).&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency project offers new and unique play-to-earn and stake-to-earn features, with TOADS as the native token. With the toad as its mascot, DigiToads aspires to revolutionize the crypto sphere. Apart from developing a new play-to-earn platform, the project is creating avenues for investors to explore investment opportunities.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The TOADS token&rsquo;s presale provides such an offering in a Metaverse space that continues to see tremendous growth.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">DigiToads (TOADS) presale gaining momentum</h2>
<p dir="ltr">DigiToads adopts a unique presale system. The TOADS token can be purchased using <a href="https://coinjournal.net/cryptocurrencies/">cryptocurrencies</a> like BTC, ETH, BNB, USDT, USDC, BUSD, and others. There is no vesting period, meaning investors can start trading when TOADS is deposited in their wallets.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The ongoing Lilypad 5 stage of the presale offers the token for a mere $0.024, And so far DigiToads has raised a whopping $2.1 million and counting.</p>
<p dir="ltr">DigiToads has an inbuilt deflationary mechanism whereby 2% of the sell and buy tax is used to purchase and burn TOADS. The token scarcity attained through this burning mechanism, together with an increased number of people seeking the asset, will eventually increase the token&rsquo;s price.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://digitoads.me/cjl"><u>&gt;&gt; Buy DigiToads Now &lt;&lt;</u></a></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">DigiToads (TOADS): What&rsquo;s unique?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Play-to-earn gaming is becoming an increasingly popular concept on Web 3.0. So it is great to see the likes of DigiToads incorporating this fantastic feature in its structure by launching &lsquo;TOAD-CADE,&rsquo; an enticing game on its platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The game starts with each player receiving a basic DigiToads. These characters can be trained, fed, and bred. This will allow them to level up and battle within the swamp. Regular competitions will be hosted by the platform winners, who can expect alluring rewards.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Besides gaming, another exciting way users can coin some money is through the compelling staking opportunities offered. Users who stake their TOADS NFTs will benefit from great rewards from the NFT staking pool. This pool, in turn, is maintained by the taxes collected on transactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">To ensure that it has a sound fiscal system, DigiToads will select 12 traders who will be responsible for executing trades on the company&rsquo;s behalf. These community traders will have access to 1/12th of the treasury and receive 10% of the profit made on each transaction. Seats for these important positions will be held by winners of trading competitions that will be held each month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DigiToads has laid the foundation of its own Merch, which will shortly be in full swing. The firm will utilize 100% of its profit to revive the Amazon rainforests. Also, 2.5% of the overall gains made have been allocated by the firm for a similar cause.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Every other firm before DigiToads started with a pre-decided mascot for itself. On the other hand, the firm gives users the right to decide on the mascot. For this, a mascot meme contest will be held, and the best design will be used as the mascot, and the creator will be entitled to mega prizes.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Is DigiToads a good investment?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">TOADS is can be one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in as the crypto sector sees a surge in new demand. The firm offers numerous use cases, while investors can buy the native token as part of their portfolio diversification. &nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">As a fact, no one can with certainty predict exactly how the market behaves in the future. However, looking at this token, the DigiToads presale tis currently attracting huge interest from crypto investors. The anticipation around the project&rsquo;s launch also suggests demand could be even higher when TOADS goes live on major exchanges.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul class="decimal_type">
<li>At press time, Metacade (MCADE) was trading at $0.03406, up 21.86%.</li>
<li>MCADE&rsquo;s price has risen by more than 49% from its price at the end of the presale.</li>
<li>The token has so far been listed on one DEX and two centralized exchanges.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://coinjournal.net/metacade/">price of MCADE</a> has surged 21.86% while the global crypto market is on the decline. The global market cap has dropped by 1.34%.</p>
<p>Metaverse tokens like MCADE seem to be performing well today with the majority of today&rsquo;s top gainers being from this category. The NFT Worlds (WRLD) token is leading with a surge of 21.88% followed by the Metacade (MCADE) token which has gained 21.86% in the last 24 hours.</p>
<h2>What is MCADE?</h2>
<p>MCADE is the native token of the gaming arcade platform <a href="https://metacade.co/en?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=invezz&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=price_prediction">Metacade</a>, which aims to become the ultimate Web3 community hub where gamers and blockchain fanatics can communicate and collaborate.</p>
<p>The MCADE presale was concluded in March 2023 offering an investment opportunity for many crypto investors.</p>
<p>The token is built on the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/ethereum/what-is-ethereum/">Ethereum&nbsp;</a>blockchain, making it an ERC token. The token has so far been listed on CoinMarketCap, Coingecko, <a href="https://coinjournal.net/uniswap/what-is-uniswap/">Uniswap</a>, and BitMart. It will be listed on MEXC Global in one day and twenty hours&rsquo; time.</p>
<h2>MCADE listing on MEXC Global</h2>
<p>MCADE&rsquo;s listing on MEXC Global crypto exchange is the next big thing after the token listed on BitMart.</p>
<p>Just like the concluded Metacade presale and the subsequent listing on Uniswap and BitMart, the upcoming MEXC Global listing has created quite a hype around the MCADE token, which is partly the reason for today&rsquo;s price surge.</p>
<h2>Metacade (MCADE) price forecast</h2>
<p>Although MCADE tested an all-time low of $0.01498 shortly after listing on CoinMarcketCap and Uniswap, the token now seems to be on a bullish trajectory having hit an all-time high of $0.03305 today.</p>
<p>At the current rate, Metacade is expected to surge towards $1, especially after the MEXC Global listing.</p>
<h2>Should you Metacade (MCADE)?</h2>
<p>Well, investing in cryptocurrencies carries a lot of risks including market volatility and scam projects. And while the Metacade project has proved to be e legit crypto project, its native token, the MCADE, is still a candidate for the volatile crypto market.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, MCADE just like its parent platform, Metacade has gained a lot of popularity among gamers, game developers, and crypto investors who turned up in droves to purchase it during the Metacade presale.</p>
<p>And although the MCADE token has not made significant bullish movement since the presale ended, the increased activity on the Metacade platform and the listing on different Centralized exchanges including the upcoming MEXC Global listing is expected to spur a significant MCADE price surge. So far, the token&rsquo;s price has risen by more than 42% from its price at the end of the presale.</p>
<p>Metacade has already earned itself its first partnership with Metastudio, a revolutionary gaming company focused on delivering exciting, avant-garde, and fresh mobile games to the Metacade arcade. The partnership kind of confirms Metacade&rsquo;s commitment to becoming a leading metaverse arcade platform.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://metacade.co/whitepaper.pdf">Metacade&rsquo;s whitepape</a>r, Metacade is expected to sign more partnerships with play-to-earn projects, gain further CEX listings, launch more gaming community giveaways and competitions, and launch a universal online hangout for all things GameFi and P2E before the end of Q2, 2023.</p>
<p>The MCADE demand is expected to increase greatly on the above-mentioned activities seeing that MCADE is the backbone of the larger Metacade ecosystem.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Key takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">MicroStrategy has recorded a profit for the first time in nine quarters, thanks to Bitcoin&rsquo;s rally since the start of the year.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">AltSignals has completed 62% of its presale and looks to raise over $300k in the coming weeks.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Market experts believe that the cryptocurrency market could record massive gains over the next few weeks and months.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">MicroStrategy, one of the biggest bulls in the cryptocurrency space, has recorded a profit for the first time in nine quarters. The positive performance was attributed to Bitcoin&rsquo;s 70% in the first quarter of 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">With Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market rallying, new projects are emerging that seek to improve certain areas of the ecosystem. One of these projects is AltSignals.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">AltSignals is looking to change how traders approach cryptocurrency trading. The project has already raised more than $600k in its presale event and will use the funds to complete the development of some of its products.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">MicroStrategy records profit in Q1</h2>
<p dir="ltr">MicroStrategy, the largest public holder of Bitcoin,&nbsp;<a href="https://decrypt.co/138564/bitcoin-rally-puts-microstrategy-green-first-time-9-quarters"><u>posted a profit</u></a> in the first quarter of 2023. This is the first time MicroStrategy is recording a profit in nine quarters, with the bear market affecting its activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The profit recorded by MicroStrategy was thanks to Bitcoin&rsquo;s rally during Q1. The&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/"><u>Bitcoin price</u></a> rose by more than 70% in the first quarter of 2023. The rally allowed MicroStrategy to repay its loan and tap a one-time tax benefit of $453.4 million.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite the bear market, MicroStrategy purchased 7,500 BTC in the first quarter of 2023, bringing its total holdings to 140,000 BTC, making it one of the largest Bitcoin holders in the world.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Crypto prices could still rise, says Grayscale analysts</h2>
<p dir="ltr">In response to the current market conditions, analysts at Grayscale believe that&nbsp;<a href="https://grayscale.com/monthly-report-2023-april-newsletter/"><u>cryptocurrency prices could still rise</u></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The analysts cited the declining inflation figures in the United States, and the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s rate hikes move as two factors that could result in the prices of cryptocurrencies soaring higher in the near term.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In addition to the positive news from MicroStrategy, Grayscale analysts pointed out that the failures of several regional banks demonstrate that investors continue to display an appetite for crypto during times of economic uncertainty.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The experts believe that there are several factors that could impact Bitcoin&rsquo;s price in the short term, and the Fed&rsquo;s upcoming rate hike could be one of them.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">AltSignals&rsquo; demand could increase as investors troop in</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The broader cryptocurrency market could benefit from MicroStrategy&rsquo;s bullish move. As more investors enter the cryptocurrency space, demand for new projects could increase.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One of the projects that could gain attention is&nbsp;<a href="https://token.altsignals.io/"><u>AltSignals</u></a>, thanks to its niche-focused approach to the market. Still in its&nbsp;<a href="https://token.altsignals.io/#how-to-buy"><u>pre-sale stage</u></a>, AltSignals has raised more than 60% of its required funds.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">AltSignals could be the focus of investors thanks to the ActualizeAI product it is building and its other catalogue of services. AltSignals seeks to make it easier for traders to trade cryptocurrency futures, forex, and a few other financial assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The project&rsquo;s AltAlgo too simplifies charts and indicators, making the entire trading process easier for people. With more traders in the market, AltSignals could see higher adoption, and ASI&rsquo;s value could record massive gains.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">AltSignals could be a good buy as market sentiment improves</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.altsignals.io/"><u>AltSignals</u></a> could be an excellent investment as the market sentiment improves. Market experts believe that the bull market could be close, and prices of most cryptocurrencies could set new all-time highs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With the prospect of a possible bull cycle, AltSignals could be one of the projects to benefit greatly. If the development team keeps to its timeline and launches ActualizeAI, the project&rsquo;s ASI token could perform excellently as its utility could increase.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">As more traders use AltSignals and its ASI token, the value could increase over time. The price of ASI could depend on the development team delivering on its promise and the fundamental conditions of Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency space.&nbsp;</p>
