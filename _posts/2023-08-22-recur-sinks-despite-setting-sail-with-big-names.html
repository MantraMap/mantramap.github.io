<p dir="ltr">The NFT platform Recur has shut down operations despite raising $50 million and having support from industry bigwigs.&nbsp;</p>
Big-Name Partnerships Fade Away
<p dir="ltr">Despite its initial promising trajectory and significant partnerships, NFT startup Recur has made the disheartening announcement that its Web3 platform is shutting down. The platform's inability to withstand the challenges of the crypto winter has led to this unexpected decision.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Recur had set sail with grand ambitions, boasting partnerships with iconic brands such as Hello Kitty and Nickelodeon. However, the cold winds of the crypto winter have taken a toll on the platform's sustainability.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The firm acknowledged that its core features would gradually phase out over the coming months, including the withdrawal of NFTs, cashing out stablecoin balances, and trading collectibles on Recur-hosted marketplaces.</p>
A Shift In The NFT Space
<p dir="ltr">Established in 2021, Recur positioned itself as a provider of Web3 "building blocks" for businesses, enabling the creation of in-game assets, loyalty programs, and digital collectibles through NFTs. However, Recur's fate is not unique, as the broader NFT space witnessed the closure of companies like Nifty, which had also secured partnerships with big media titles.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With over 380,000 minted NFTs, Recur is working to ensure the legacy of these digital collectibles. The company plans to migrate metadata and media for its NFTs to the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a decentralized file-sharing network. Additionally, other assets will be hosted on Filecoin's network, indicating Recur's commitment to maintaining the digital artifacts it helped create.</p>
A Shift In Value
<p dir="ltr">Recur's journey included milestones like the Recur Pass, which was initially sold as an NFT for $300 and granted holders early access to NFT drops. Despite an impressive early sale of a Recur Pass for $88,888, current prices reflect a stark contrast, with the cheapest pass listed on OpenSea for 0.001 ETH (about $1.69).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Recur had garnered notable attention with a $50 million Series A funding round in late 2021, valuing the company at $333 million. Esteemed investors like Gary Vaynerchuk, the Winklevoss twins, and Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin participated in an earlier $5 million seed funding round. Despite the initial momentum, Recur's journey underscores the volatility and challenges inherent in the NFT landscape.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In conclusion, Recur's announcement to shut down its Web3 platform serves as a sobering reminder of the challenges faced by NFT-focused companies in the ever-evolving crypto space. The dissolution of big-name partnerships and the necessity to adapt to changing market dynamics highlight the fragility of even the most promising ventures.</p>
