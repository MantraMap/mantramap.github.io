<h2>Jim Cramer Praises SEC Chairman Gary Gensler</h2>
<p>The host of CNBC&#x2019;s Mad Money show, Jim Cramer, has thanked the chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, for not approving a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Cramer is a former hedge fund manager who co-founded Thestreet.com, a financial news and literacy website.</p>
<p>The Mad Money host tweeted Friday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thank you, SEC Chief Gary Gensler for standing up to the crypto bullies who wanted an ETF. They could have been blown to kingdom come by Genesis Global, now filing for bankruptcy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Crypto lender Genesis Global Capital LLC is part of a subsidiary of venture capital firm Digital Currency Group (DCG). Genesis filed for <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-lender-genesis-files-for-bankruptcy-following-sec-lawsuit/">bankruptcy</a> following an SEC <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-charges-genesis-and-gemini-winklevoss-says-regulators-lawsuit-is-super-lame/">lawsuit</a> alleging that the company and crypto exchange Gemini offered and sold unregistered securities to retail investors through the Gemini Earn crypto asset lending program.</p>
<p>Another DCG subsidiary is digital asset manager Grayscale Investments, which has been trying to convert its flagship Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot bitcoin ETF. However, the securities watchdog has not approved the company&#x2019;s filing. In June last year, Grayscale <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/grayscale-files-lawsuit-against-sec-over-spot-bitcoin-etf-rejection/">filed a lawsuit against the SEC</a> challenging the regulator&#x2019;s decision to reject its bitcoin ETF application.</p>
<p>In addition, Bloomberg reported earlier this month that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)&#x2019;s Eastern District of New York and the SEC are <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-07/crypto-empire-dcg-faces-us-investigation-over-internal-transfers">investigating</a> internal transfers between Genesis and DCG.</p>
<h2>Many People Disagree With Cramer</h2>
<p>Many bitcoin proponents on Twitter disagreed with the Mad Money host. Lawyer John Deaton <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1616447390818664449">wrote</a>: &#x201C;So anyone who favored a spot <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> ETF is a bully? Cramer believes people were protected by Gary Gensler NOT granting a spot ETF, even though <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> futures and short ETFs exist. These companies didn&#x2019;t get in trouble because of bitcoin.&#x201D; ETF Store President Nate Geraci <a href="https://twitter.com/NateGeraci/status/1616511303337615360">opined</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I would argue exact opposite&#x2026; SEC failing to approve spot ETF led to rise of GBTC arbitrage trade (where large accredited investors took advantage of retail). Meaningful portion of Genesis solvency issues stem from lending to 3AC, etc to execute that arbitrage trade (which blew up).</p></blockquote>
<p>Cramer has repeatedly warned about the SEC doing a &#x201C;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jim-cramer-expects-sec-to-do-a-roundup-of-uncompliant-crypto-firms-urges-investors-to-get-out-of-crypto-now/">roundup</a>&#x201D; of uncompliant crypto firms, advising investors to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/mad-moneys-jim-cramer-advises-investors-to-get-out-of-crypto-says-its-never-too-late-to-sell/">get out of crypto now</a>. &#x201C;I wouldn&#x2019;t touch crypto in a million years,&#x201D; the Mad Money host <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jim-cramer-urges-sec-to-do-a-big-crypto-sweep-says-i-wouldnt-touch-crypto-in-a-million-years/">stressed</a>. He often cited John Reed Stark, SEC&#x2019;s former head of internet enforcement, who recently said a &#x201C;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/former-sec-officials-crypto-warning-regulatory-onslaught-is-just-beginning/">regulatory onslaught</a> is just beginning.&#x201D; Following the SEC lawsuit against Gemini and Genesis, Cramer tweeted: &#x201C;Here comes the crackdown: Genesis and Gemini are first. We have had a fabulous short squeeze run. Ka-ching. Ka-ching.&#x201D;</p>

<h2>SEC Slammed for Enforcement-Centric Approach</h2>
<p>While Cramer appreciated Gensler and the SEC, many people have criticized the SEC chairman for focusing on enforcement and not taking action to prevent the FTX catastrophe after <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/conflicting-reports-emerge-about-sec-helping-bankrupt-crypto-exchange-ftx-with-legal-loopholes/">several meetings</a> with former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF).</p>
<p>Congressman Tom Emmer (R-MN) commented on Twitter last week after the SEC announced <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-charges-genesis-and-gemini-winklevoss-says-regulators-lawsuit-is-super-lame/">charges</a> against Gemini and Genesis: &#x201C;Gary Gensler is once again late to the game, &#x2018;protecting&#x2019; no one. Quite clear that his political &#x2018;regulation through enforcement&#x2019; strategy hurts everyday Americans.&#x201D; In a follow-up tweet, the lawmaker wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Gary Gensler, when can we expect proactive guidance instead of leaving the industry to interpret the rules of the road through your after-the-fact enforcement actions?</p></blockquote>

The executive explained that inflation has clearly peaked and China has made a &#8220;major, major pivot&#8221; economically.</strong></p>
<h2>Morgan Stanley&#8217;s CEO on U.S. Economy and Inflation</h2>
<p>The chairman and CEO of global investment bank Morgan Stanley, James Gorman, discussed the U.S. economy and China&#8217;s relationship with the U.S. in an interview with CNBC Thursday in Davos, Switzerland.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two things have changed recently that really matter,&#8221; he began, noting that the first concerns inflation while the second concerns China&#8217;s recent pivot economically.</p>
<p>&#8220;The inflation numbers are better,&#8221; the Morgan Stanley chief said, emphasizing:</p>
<blockquote><p>Clearly, inflation peaked. That&#8217;s no longer a question. It&#8217;s a fact.</p></blockquote>
<p>He added that the question is can the Federal Reserve get to its 2% inflation target and &#8220;how hard will they try to get to 2% vs. stabilizing around 3%, 4%.&#8221;</p>
<p>Regarding the Fed hiking interest rates, Gorman pointed out: &#8220;We were on a 75-basis point track. We then quickly moved to 50.&#8221; At the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, he expects the Fed to increase rates by 25 basis points, stating: &#8220;I could see them doing 25, followed by 25, followed by a pause. I mean, that&#8217;s not implausible.&#8221;</p>
<h2>&#8216;China Has Made a Major, Major Pivot&#8217;</h2>
<p>Gorman explained that another important change that has happened recently concerns China. He described:</p>
<blockquote><p>The second thing that happened is China has made a major, major pivot. Now the focus was on the reopening which was obviously critical.</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8220;The recent pivot economically, the relationship thawing with the U.S., the meeting &#8230; with the vice premier and Secretary Yellen — this is a big deal,&#8221; the Morgan Stanley CEO continued.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen met with China&#8217;s Vice Premier Liu He on Wednesday &#8220;as part of efforts to deepen communication and work together to address global challenges,&#8221; the Treasury explained last week. In November last year, President Joe Biden and President Xi Jinping also met in Bali and &#8220;agreed to empower key senior officials to engage in these issues,&#8221; the Treasury further noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Under President Xi&#8217;s mantra of common prosperity, there are two ways to achieve that,&#8221; Gorman detailed, concluding:</p>
<blockquote><p>One is by redistribution of existing prosperity, so everyone gets a piece of the pie. The other is by growing the pie so everybody gets a piece of the pie. They have pivoted, I think, from the former to the latter. That is good news for global growth.</p></blockquote>

On Friday, Federal Reserve governor Christopher Waller said that he favors a quarter-point benchmark rate increase at the next FOMC meeting. Analysts believe that current market trajectories will be dependent on the outcome of the next Fed meeting.</strong></p>
<h2>Markets Still on Edge Ahead of Fed Meeting Despite Equities, Cryptocurrencies, and Precious Metals Rallying in 2023</h2>
<p>On Saturday, Jan. 21, 2023, at 2:45 p.m. Eastern Time, the global cryptocurrency market capitalization was up 5.87% over the previous day and hovering around $1.06 trillion in value. The leading crypto asset, <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a>, had climbed 11.63% higher against the U.S. dollar in the past seven days. The second-leading digital currency in terms of market valuation, <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH/">ethereum (ETH)</a>, had risen 8.33% that week against the greenback. The increase in value of these two crypto assets has also increased the U.S. dollar value of the thousands of digital currencies below <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>.</p>

<p>The day prior, on Friday, Jan. 20, equity markets closed the day in the green. The top four benchmark stocks (S&P 500, Dow Jones, Nasdaq, and Russell 2000) ended the day between 1% and 2.66% higher against the U.S. dollar. The Nasdaq Composite was the highest, rising 2.66%, the S&P 500 rose by 1.89%, the Russell 2000 index (RUT) jumped 1.69% higher, and the Dow increased by 1% on Friday. U.S. equities have posted their second consecutive week of gains so far this year. The small-cap stock market index RUT has risen 7.1% this year, with small-cap shares leading the equities race in 2023.</p>

<p>Precious metals have done well too with a troy ounce of gold trading for <a href="https://www.kitco.com/market/">$1,927.30 per unit </a>and silver trading for $24.01 per ounce. Like cryptocurrencies and stocks, precious metals have rallied in 2023, erasing the losses that took place in Dec. 2022. Gold enthusiast Peter Schiff believes the price of the precious yellow metal will grow higher this year. &#x201C;Gold is now trading above $1,934, its highest price since April of 2022,&#x201D; Schiff <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterSchiff/status/1616167496536440840?s=20&t=x9BgftNitWC9-ZnqSYRyfw">tweeted</a> on Jan. 19. &#x201C;Gold stocks, however, still haven&#x2019;t even taken out last week&#x2019;s high. In fact, gold stocks need to rise 30% from here just to get back to where they were trading in April of 2022. This sale may not last long,&#x201D; he added.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.kitco.com/news/2023-01-20/Gold-price-eyes-1-950-but-it-might-have-to-wait-until-the-Fed-meeting-before-moving-on-to-2-000-analysts.html">Speaking</a> with Kitco News, OANDA senior market analyst Edward Moya detailed that gold prices will remain indifferent until the Federal Reserve&#x2019;s February 2023 meeting. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s going to be choppy,&#x201D; Moya said. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m neutral on gold until the Fed&#x2019;s meeting on February 1. Major resistance is at $2,000. But I would be surprised if we move above $1,950. We&#x2019;re likely to consolidate here until the Fed meeting,&#x201D; the market analyst added. Market analysts and macroeconomic experts have <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/uncertainty-surrounds-federal-reserves-future-plans-for-rate-hikes/">no idea</a> what the Fed will do at the FOMC meeting. Some believe an aggressive tightening schedule will continue, while others expect the Fed to ease up and pivot with a &#x2018;soft landing.&#x2019;</p>
<p>The Biden administration and White House economist Heather Boushey <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-likely-headed-economic-soft-landing-white-houses-boushey-2023-01-06/">told Reuters</a> that current leaders do not expect a recession. &#x201C;The steps have been taken and it looks like we&#x2019;re in a very good position to have that soft landing that everyone&#x2019;s talking about,&#x201D; Boushey insisted. On Friday, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/20/fed-governor-waller-backs-quarter-point-interest-rate-hike-at-next-meeting.html">told</a> reporters at a Council on Foreign Relations conference in New York that he favors a smaller rate hike than the previous seven. So far, the Fed has implemented seven rate hikes in 2022, two of which were half-point rises and five were three-quarter-point increases. Waller can envision a quarter-point increase at the next FOMC meeting next month.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I currently favor a 25-basis point increase at the FOMC&#x2019;s next meeting at the end of this month,&#x201D; Waller told the press. &#x201C;Beyond that, we still have a considerable way to go toward our 2 percent inflation goal, and I expect to support continued tightening of monetary policy,&#x201D; the Fed governor added.</p>

<p>It&#x2019;s quite likely that all three major markets (precious metals, cryptocurrencies, and stocks) will react in some way or another after the Fed&#x2019;s next decision. Many believe the next FOMC meeting decision will be entirely dependent on inflation gauges. U.S. President Joe Biden has been tweeting about the U.S. economy during the course of the weekend as he believes the country is on the road to recovery. &#x201C;Annual inflation has fallen for six straight months and gas is down $1.70 from its peak,&#x201D; Biden <a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1616819389507985408?s=20&t=x9BgftNitWC9-ZnqSYRyfw">tweeted</a> on Saturday morning at 10:25 a.m. Eastern Time. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re successfully moving from economic recovery to stable growth,&#x201D; Biden added.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think the outcome of the next FOMC meeting will be and how do you believe it will affect the current market trajectories for equities, precious metals, and cryptocurrencies? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.</strong></em></p>

During a Zoom presentation, Friedberg claimed there was a conflict of interest between former and current FTX executives and FTX US&#8217; general counsel, as Ryne Miller once worked for S&amp;C. Judge Dorsey, however, was not swayed by Friedberg&#8217;s 17-page objection and appointed S&amp;C, stating that &#8220;there&#8217;s no evidence of actual conflict here.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>FTX Bankruptcy Raises Questions of Conflict of Interest and Odd Decisions</h2>
<p>The day before bankruptcy judge John Dorsey approved Sullivan &amp; Cromwell (S&amp;C) to represent the debtors as legal counsel, <a href="https://twitter.com/MetaLawMan">James &#8220;Metalawman&#8221; Murphy</a> published a Twitter thread <a href="https://twitter.com/MetaLawMan/status/1616102574838669312?s=20&amp;t=ZDMuuxhwbcQcYm4oY-LvLg">explaining</a> that it was odd that S&amp;C would likely be chosen for FTX representation. &#8220;There&#8217;s something off with the FTX bankruptcy,&#8221; Murphy insisted in his post. Murphy, an attorney who specializes in metaverse, Web3, and digital asset subjects, questioned the involvement of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/new-ftx-ceo-discusses-possibility-of-rebooting-defunct-crypto-exchange-in-first-interview-since-taking-over/">John J. Ray III</a>, the new FTX CEO and chief restructuring officer, in the process.</p>
<p>The attorney Murphy points out that when Ray worked with Enron as the chief restructuring officer, Ray did an excellent job aggressively pursuing recoveries for the benefit of Enron&#8217;s creditors. However, Murphy <a href="https://twitter.com/MetaLawMan/status/1616102579955707905?s=20&amp;t=ZDMuuxhwbcQcYm4oY-LvLg">said</a> that Ray is acting very differently from the hard-bargaining CEO he was known as at Enron and questioned this change in attitude. For example, the metaverse lawyer detailed that when he was restructuring Enron, Ray never suggested for a moment that one of Enron&#8217;s primary outside law firms should serve as debtor&#8217;s counsel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Inexplicably, Mr. Ray now supports S&amp;C&#8217;s move to serve as debtors&#8217; counsel,&#8221; Murphy <a href="https://twitter.com/MetaLawMan/status/1616102581486460928?s=20&amp;t=ZDMuuxhwbcQcYm4oY-LvLg">noted</a>. The lawyer further said that this is despite S&amp;C handling &#8220;20 engagements for FTX in just 16 months,&#8221; being &#8220;paid $8.5 million in fees,&#8221; and &#8220;representing key figures [Sam Bankman-Fried] and [Nishad Singh] personally.&#8221; Murphy remarked that at Enron, Ray &#8220;aggressively pursued claims against Enron&#8217;s outside law firms.&#8221; The lawyer <a href="https://twitter.com/MetaLawMan/status/1616102583403433984?s=20&amp;t=ZDMuuxhwbcQcYm4oY-LvLg">continued</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Vinson &amp; Elkins paid $30 million to settle and Andrews Kurth paid $18.5 million. According to an independent report, these firms failed to respond to red flags suggesting possible misconduct.</p></blockquote>
<p>Murphy also <a href="https://twitter.com/MetaLawMan/status/1616102589665316869?s=20&amp;t=ZDMuuxhwbcQcYm4oY-LvLg">opined</a> that the ultimate irony of this situation is that the enormous fees will be paid by the victims of the FTX fraud — the customers. &#8220;My prediction: The unified front of Mr. Ray, the Official Creditors Committee, and S&amp;C will prevail, and the judge will appoint Sullivan &amp; Cromwell debtors&#8217; counsel … This is not normal,&#8221; Murphy concluded. During the hearing the next day, Daniel Friedberg, a former FTX US compliance officer, <a href="https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/FTX/Home-DocketInfo">objected</a> to S&amp;C being appointed and submitted a 17-page objection for the bankruptcy judge to review. In the filing, the former FTX US compliance officer said that Ryne Miller, FTX US&#8217; general counsel, was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryne-miller-78a6b84/details/experience/">once employed by S&amp;C</a>.</p>
<p>“Mr. Miller informed me that it is very important for him personally to channel a lot of business to S&amp;C as he wanted to return there as a partner after his stint with the debtors,&#8221; Friedberg&#8217;s complaint details. Despite the objection, Bankruptcy Judge Dorsey told court participants that &#8220;there&#8217;s no evidence of actual conflict here,&#8221; adding that it was &#8220;hearsay, innuendo, speculation, rumors, and certainly not something I would allow to be introduced into evidence.&#8221;</p>

<p>After S&amp;C was appointed as debtors&#8217; counsel, James &#8220;Metalawman&#8221; Murphy added his two cents about the decision. “As expected, the judge approves Sullivan &amp; Cromwell as debtors&#8217; counsel. Judge says, on the record before him, he has no concern about S&amp;C conflicts of interest,” Murphy <a href="https://twitter.com/MetaLawMan/status/1616481761650962433?s=20&amp;t=ZDMuuxhwbcQcYm4oY-LvLg">wrote</a>. “Any suspense about this decision was eliminated when the U.S. Trustee switched position to favor S&amp;C&#8217;s appointment.” The same day, U.S. federal prosecutors <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-government-seizes-700-million-in-assets-from-disgraced-ftx-co-founder-sam-bankman-fried/">seized</a> nearly $700 million in assets from the disgraced FTX co-founder Bankman-Fried.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think about the appointment of Sullivan &amp; Cromwell as debtors&#8217; counsel for FTX and the allegations of conflict of interest raised by former FTX US compliance officer Daniel Friedberg and James &#8220;Metalawman&#8221; Murphy?

<h2>Bitcoin&#x2019;s Value Rises 37.2% in 30 Days, Pushing Dominance Level Above 40%</h2>
<p>Bitcoin jumped above the $23,000 zone on Jan. 21 and the crypto asset&#x2019;s value is now 37.2% higher than it was 30 days ago. The increase has pushed <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s dominance level above the 40% region. According to coinmarketcap.com (CMC) data, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s dominance level on Jan. 21 is around 42.4%.</p>

<p>The leading crypto asset&#x2019;s dominance level rose above the 40% region after the first week of January 2023. The crypto economy aggregator coingecko.com (CG) indicates that bitcoin&#x2019;s dominance is around 41.1% on Jan. 21. Bitcoin&#x2019;s dominance is the digital currency&#x2019;s market capitalization divided by the crypto economy&#x2019;s entire market valuation.</p>
<p>From 2009 to 2017, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s dominance level held above the 80% range. But after dropping below 80%, the dominance level never returned to that position. While <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s dominance is around 41-42% today, CG metrics show the second-leading crypto asset, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>), has a dominance level of around 18.4%.</p>

<p>CMC data suggests <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>&#x2019;s dominance is around 19.3% out of the $1.05 trillion in U.S. dollar value. Other major dominant players in January 2023 include tether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>) as it commands 6.33% market dominance, and binance coin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a>) has a dominance level of around 4.57%.</p>
<p>The stablecoin USDC has a market dominance level of around 4.13%, and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a>&#x2019;s is roughly 1.99%, according to CMC statistics on Saturday afternoon at 11:30 a.m. Eastern Time. Between <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a>, USDC, and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a>, the dominance level of all six coins is around 78.72% on Jan. 21. The last time <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s dominance was this high was six months ago in mid-July 2022.</p>

<h2>US Government Seizes Millions in Cash and Robinhood Shares From FTX Co-Founder; SBF Denies Misappropriation of Customer Assets</h2>
<p>The U.S. government has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/20/feds-seize-almost-700-million-of-sam-bankman-frieds-assets-in-cash-and-equity.html">seized nearly $700 million</a> from the former FTX CEO and co-founder, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/from-a-32-billion-valuation-to-financial-troubles-an-in-depth-look-at-the-rise-and-fall-of-ftx/">Sam Bankman-Fried</a> (SBF), according to court documents reviewed by CNBC. Most of the funds came from the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftx-attempts-to-freeze-robinhood-shares-as-creditors-swarm-to-scoop-450m-in-hood-stock/">56,273,269 shares</a> of Robinhood Markets Inc. (Nasdaq: <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/HOOD:NASDAQ">HOOD</a>) owned by Bankman-Fried. Using exchange rates from Jan. 20, 2023, the Hood shares are worth more than $526 million.</p>
<p>Furthermore, CNBC reporters Rohan Goswami and MacKenzie Sigalos detail that nearly $56 million held in four bank accounts was seized as well. Three accounts holding $6 million were allegedly held at <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/silvergate-capital-incurs-loss-of-1-billion-in-q4-of-2022/">Silvergate Bank</a> and one account reportedly held at Moonstone Bank held $50 million. In total, $171 million in cash was taken by the federal government from Bankman-Fried. Moonstone Bank <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230119005836/en/">explained</a> on Jan. 19, 2023, that the financial institution will officially be exiting the crypto space.</p>
<p>Alameda Research <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221129006115/en/Moonstone-Bank-Issues-Statement-Regarding-Alameda-Research-Ventures-LLC">invested $11.5 million</a> into Moonstone Bank, also known as Farmington State Bank, through FBH, Moonstone&#8217;s holding company. Federal prosecutors believe the $697 million in assets, mostly made up of Robinhood shares, were acquired using funds stolen from FTX customers. Bankman-Fried maintains his innocence and has &#8220;denied misappropriating customer assets,&#8221; Sigalos explained on Friday.</p>

<p>Additionally, federal agents also seized funds that belonged to SBF that were held on the crypto exchanges <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-to-increase-presence-in-poland-in-compliance-with-local-regulations/">Binance</a> and Binance US. The U.S. government <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-government-seizes-robinhood-shares-linked-to-ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried/">revealed intentions</a> to seize the Robinhood shares during the first week of January 2023, and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) initiated the process.</p>
<p>Bankman-Fried <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sbf-fights-for-robinhood-shares-says-he-needs-them-more-than-ftx-customers-who-only-suffer-possibility-of-economic-loss/">attempted</a> to regain access to the shares, noting that he needed the money to pay for legal expenses. The U.S. government can seize funds from citizens suspected of wrongdoing without necessarily charging them with a crime and from charged suspects awaiting trial. Federal prosecutors do not believe the assets seized are the property in the bankruptcy estate.</p>

The token hit a 12-week high in today&#x2019;s session, breaking out of a key price ceiling in the process. Cardano also rose to its strongest point since November, with the global cryptocurrency market cap up 6.86% as of writing.</strong></p>
<h2>Solana (SOL)</h2>
<p>Solana (SOL), was one of Saturday&#x2019;s notable gainers, as the token rose by as much as 20% in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>SOL/USD hit a high of $26.41 to start the weekend, which follows on from Friday&#x2019;s low at $21.27.</p>
<p>As a result of this move, solana broke out of a key resistance level of $25.00, hitting its strongest point since November 8 in the process.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) also broke out of a ceiling of its own at the 73.00 mark.</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is tracking at 73.84, with the next visible resistance at the 81.00 zone.</p>
<p>If bulls were to collide with this wall, then it is likely that solana could move above the $30.00 point.</p>

<h2>Cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>)</h2>
<p>Another big mover on the weekend was cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>), which also moved to its strongest point since November.</p>
<p>Following a low of $0.3364 on Saturday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>/USD raced to an intraday peak of $0.3726 earlier today.</p>
<p>This surge saw cardano jump to its strongest point in the past 12 weeks, breaking out of a resistance of $0.3650 in the process.</p>

<p>As can be seen on the chart, the move took price strength to a ceiling of 73.00, however, it has so far failed to overcome this hurdle.</p>
<p>Due to this, earlier gains have somewhat eased, as traders moved to secure gains, leading to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a> currently trading at $0.366.</p>
<p>Should this obstacle be eventually overcome, the next target for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a> bulls will likely be $0.40.</p>

Ethereum also rallied, as it hit its strongest point since September.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) raced past the $23,000 level to start the weekend, with prices climbing to a multi-month high.</p>
<p>Following a low of $20,961.21 on Friday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD climbed to an intraday peak of $23,249.89 earlier today.</p>
<p>Today&#x2019;s rally saw bitcoin jump to its highest level since August 24, when price at the time was trading at a top of $23,600.</p>

<p>As can be seen from the chart, the move comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) moved back towards a ceiling of 90.00.</p>
<p>Currently, the index is at the 86.30 level, with earlier gains somewhat fading, as traders move to secure profits.</p>
<p>As of writing, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> is trading at $22,902.03, which is still roughly 9.27% higher than yesterday&#x2019;s low.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Like bitcoin, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) also surged on Saturday, as it climbed to its highest mark in the last four months.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD hit a high of $1,674.18 earlier in the day, which comes following a bottom of $1,550.03 on Friday.</p>
<p>As a result of the move, ethereum recaptured a high not seen since September 13, which is the last time it traded over $1,700.</p>

<p>Although prices are currently below this threshold, the resurgence of bullish momentum on Saturday could lead to further surges this weekend.</p>
<p>The surge has pushed the 10-day (red) moving average back into an uptrend, extending its distance from its 25-day (blue) counterpart.</p>
<p>Overall, ethereum is up 6.28% as of writing.</p>

In fact, more crypto companies settled in the country during the past turbulent year than those that left it, or the business altogether.</strong></p>
<h2>Crypto Valley in Switzerland Maintains Number of Residents Despite Crypto Winter</h2>
<p>The market downturn and the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/troubled-crypto-exchange-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection-ceo-steps-down/">collapse</a> of platforms like cryptocurrency exchange FTX and the Terra-luna ecosystem sent shockwaves through the industry. The negative events of 2022 led to losses for investors, customers, and companies while major players like Coinbase and Genesis announced layoffs.</p>
<p>However, data compiled by the venture capital firm CV VC shows that crypto-friendly Switzerland hasn’t witnessed anything too spectacular, Swissinfo reported. According to its ‘Top 50’ report, 183 Swiss blockchain businesses went bust last year, but 190 startups and foreign companies opened new offices.</p>
<p>The researchers also found that the Swiss Crypto Valley, centered in the canton of Zug, now has approximately the same number of entities as in 2021 — currently 1,135. They employ 5,766 people, which is only around 4% less than before the crypto winter started.</p>
<p>The most prominent Swiss-registered companies that went under were FTX Europe and the crypto asset manager Covario. “The Swiss branch of U.K.-based crypto lender Nexo is also under the microscope after the company’s Bulgarian offices were <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-lender-nexo-under-investigation-for-alleged-money-laundering-russian-sanction-violations-in-bulgaria/">searched</a>,” the news portal remarks.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, none of the other big names has admitted to being severely impacted by the ongoing volatility in the sector. One of the reasons for that, the article points out, is the attitude of Swiss authorities regarding potentially corrupt enterprises.</p>
<p>For example, Switzerland’s Financial Market Supervisory Authority blocked an attempt by the FTX subsidiary to acquire the Swiss Neue Privat Bank, citing insufficient regulatory oversight over the group’s other global activities.</p>
<p>The CV VC study also shows that the valuation of the top 24 blockchain companies increased 55% to $9.7 billion despite crypto assets losing significant value. The biggest gainers among them are 21Shares, an issuer of crypto-backed exchange traded certificates, and Gnosis Safe, which manages Ethereum-based assets. Both have been valued at over $1 billion, according to the report.</p>

According to the country&#8217;s minister of state for artificial intelligence and the digital economy, Omar Sultan Al Olama, no crypto entity has been &#8220;able to onboard any customers even last week.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>VARA Has Yet to Grant a Full Market Product License</h2>
<p>The United Arab Emirates&#8217; virtual assets regulator, the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), has not issued any operating license to date, the country’s digital economy minister Omar Sultan Al Olama has said. Speaking at the World Economic Forum (WEF), Al Olama reportedly said that no crypto exchange entity including Binance and FTX has been granted the full market product (FMP) license.</p>
<p>As per Al Olama’s remarks <a href="https://laraontheblock.blogspot.com/2023/01/uae-has-not-granted-single-virtual.html?m=1">published</a> on Laraontheblock, no crypto is yet to complete the VARA’s four-step process. Accordingly, this means &#8220;no one was able to onboard any customers even last week.&#8221;</p>
<p>In March 2022, the VARA said it had granted Binance a minimal viable product (MVP) license which allowed it to offer an approved range of virtual asset-related services to suitably qualified retail and institutional investors in Dubai. Similar licenses have also been issued to other crypto exchange platforms. Some crypto exchanges have seemingly used these licenses when touting their credentials to potential clients.</p>
<p>However, the VARA has now clarified that the licenses issued to Binance and other crypto exchange platforms are only &#8220;Provisional&#8221; at stage one, or &#8220;MVP-Preparatory&#8221; at stage two.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h2>VASPs Not Allowed to Offer Services to Mass Retail Consumers</h2>
<p>According to VARA, these licenses are only issued to allow virtual assets service providers (VASPs) to fulfill pre-conditions and begin readiness. The regulator also reiterated Al Olama’s position that no crypto entity has been given the full license.</p>
<p>&#8220;No VARA licensee has, to date, been awarded an MVP-Operating permit, to provide regulated services or activities to their specifically authorised market segment(s) in the Emirate. Any information or representation to the contrary is inaccurate and misleading,&#8221; the regulator clarified in a market notification on its <a href="https://www.vara.ae/en/#0">website</a>.</p>
<p>Echoing Al Olama’s message at the WEF, the regulator said the MVP licensees are not allowed to offer their services to mass retail consumers &#8220;until the stage gate (4) FMP licence approval has been secured.&#8221;</p>
