<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/tether-usdt-kava-l1-blockchain/">Tether (USDT) Launches on Kava L1 Blockchain, KAVA Price Jumps More Than 10%</a></p>
<p>The leading United States dollar-pegged stablecoin, Tether (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/tether/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USDT</a>) has found a new channel to mainstream adoption through the Kava network, a layer one (L1) blockchain that was designed with scalability and speed in mind. According to the announcement, Tether USDT will work closely with the Kava blockchain to reshape the future of decentralized finance.</p>
<p>Following the announcement, the Kava chain’s native coin, KAVA, jumped more than 10 percent in the past 24 hours to trade around $0.9117 on Wednesday. The coin is, however, 90 percent down from its ATH, about $9.12, which was achieved during 2021’s crypto bull market.</p>
<h2>Kava Blockchain Meets Tether (USDT)</h2>
<p>With the importance of stablecoins well understood in the cryptocurrency industry, the integration of Tether USDT on the Kava chain is expected to have long-term mutual benefits for both ecosystems.</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to be launching USD₮ on Kava, offering its strong community access to the world’s first, most stable, most trusted, and most widely used stablecoin,” <a href="https://tether.to/en/tether-token-usdt-to-launch-on-kava/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> Paolo Ardoino, CTO at Tether. “The Kava network is a unique and widely followed blockchain with a robust track record of four years with zero security issues, which is essential to protecting USD₮ users.  Together, we aim to reshape the future of decentralized finance, fostering a robust and inclusive ecosystem that benefits users worldwide.”</p>
<p>Notably, Kava joins a growing list of blockchains that have integrated the leading stablecoin with a market capitalization of about $83.66 billion. As of today, Tether USDT is available on several blockchains including Ethereum, Solana, Algorand, EOS, Liquid Network, Omni, and Tron. Additionally, the Binance cryptocurrency exchange provides its global users with a BEP20 version of the Tether USDT by holding the underlying assets from other blockchains.</p>
<p>The Kava network has been preparing for mainstream adoption since its official launch in 2018. Moreover, the Kava network was established with a co-chain design that taps into the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) and the interoperability of the software development kit of the Cosmos ecosystem.</p>
<p>Last month, the Kana team announced that Kava 13 mainnet is live for public use. The Kava 13 update enables users to enjoy more security, scalability, functionality, and faster transaction speed.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/kava_chain/status/1659038916295512065?s=46&#038;t=Br3eoTSEDnpKSVMKrmKCXg</p>
<h2>Bigger Picture</h2>
<p>The integration of Tether USDT into the Kava network is a clear indication that the cryptocurrency industry in the United States has a bright future despite the periodic legal actions by the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>, the CFTC, and the New York Attorney&#8217;s Office. Moreover, the Kava chain is a low-cap ecosystem with a fully diluted valuation of about $528 million and a 24-hour trading volume of about $27.2 million.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coinbase-legal-measures-storm/">Coinbase Takes Preemptive Legal Measures to Navigate Regulatory Storm</a></p>
<p>In the face of intensified regulatory scrutiny within the cryptocurrency industry, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/coinbase/">Coinbase Global Inc</a> (NASDAQ: COIN), a prominent American digital assets service provider, took a strategic legal approach to proactively influence court rulings in unrelated cases before becoming the primary target of a US crackdown.</p>
<p>According to a recent <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/coinbase-waged-unusual-legal-defense-ahead-secs-crypto-crackdown-2023-06-21/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a> by Reuters, Coinbase engaged in a counterattack by enlisting the expertise of highly esteemed attorneys in two separate crypto-related lawsuits filed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>) before the Commission filed its own lawsuit on June 6. The SEC claimed in the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-102" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suit</a> that Coinbase operated illegally in the country without proper authorization from the authorities.</p>
<p>By strategically involving itself in these cases, Coinbase aimed to sway judges to adopt specific viewpoints and perspectives on open legal questions, which has become critical in its legal battle with the regulatory body.</p>
<p>Legal experts have stated that while a favorable ruling in an unrelated crypto case at the trial court level may not directly impact Coinbase&#8217;s current situation with the SEC, the company could potentially reference such a ruling as part of its defense strategy.</p>
<p>This strategic maneuvering reflects the exchange&#8217;s commitment to navigating the unregulated nature of crypto assets and defending its position amidst the growing scrutiny faced by the industry from the US government.</p>
<p>Coinbase has been a vocal advocate for introducing a clear regulatory framework for digital assets. Earlier this year, the exchange launched a <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coinbase-crypto435-pro-crypto-policy/">pro-crypto policy campaign</a> called Crypto435, urging American policymakers to develop comprehensive legislation governing the use of cryptocurrencies in the country.</p>
<p>The exchange also plans to mobilize 50 million crypto enthusiasts and users to join political forces in their respective districts to champion clear regulations in the crypto space. The move comes after the SEC issued a Well Notice to the exchange and informed them of a potential civil suit.</p>
<h2>Coinbase Files Amicus Curiae Brief</h2>
<p>In addition to recruiting top-tier lawyers to bolster its defense, the American crypto exchange has also filed &#8220;amicus briefs,&#8221; commonly known as friend-of-the-court briefs, to support defendants in the two cases.</p>
<p>According to Gibson Dunn &amp; Crutcher, a renowned law firm in America, amicus briefs are a common occurrence in the US Supreme Court. Still, they are relatively rare in federal trial courts, representing only 0.1% of cases.</p>
<p>However, there has been an increasing trend of various crypto industry groups <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-judge-motion-amici-ripple-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filing</a> amicus briefs to support defendants within SEC cases. For instance, in the ongoing legal battle between the SEC and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ripple-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ripple Labs</a>, several crypto companies and enthusiasts, including Coinbase and the American-based crypto group Blockchain Association, have submitted separate amicus briefs to stand with Ripple.</p>
<p>Coinbase&#8217;s argument centers around the notion that the company deserves fair notice rather than facing surprise enforcement actions, which is the SEC&#8217;s style of regulation in the industry.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitcoin-btc-price-29000-etf/">Bitcoin (BTC) Price Shoots to $29,000 amid Flurry of Bitcoin ETF Applications</a></p>
<p>Over the last 24 hours, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC</a>) has seen its price shoot by a staggering 8% moving closer to $29,000 levels. As of press time, BTC is trading at $28,884 with a market cap of $560 billion. The recent catalyst to the BTC price surge has been a flurry of applications for the spot Bitcoin ETF over the last week.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin ETF Applications and Their Impact on BTC Price</h2>
<p>On Monday, two asset managers WisdomTree and Invesco filed for spot Bitcoin ETFs with the US SEC. These filings come within a week after financial behemoth BlackRock filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF. Another catalyst to the Bitcoin price rally was crypto exchange EDX Markets, backed by firms including Citadel Securities, Fidelity Digital Assets, and Charles Schwab Corp. announcing to start operations.</p>
<p>Tuesday&#8217;s filing from WisdomTree notes that the WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust would be listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange under the ticker BTCW. On the same day, $1.5 trillion asset manager Invesco also filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF. This is for the second time that both players have submitted their Bitcoin ETF application to the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>. Back in 2021, Invesco had filed for a futures-based Bitcoin ETF but pulled out the application at the last moment.</p>
<div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]">

<div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">
<div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light">
<p>The SEC has been reluctant to approve Bitcoin ETFs, including previous attempts by WisdomTree. The regulator has expressed concerns about risks such as fraud and manipulation in the spot market for Bitcoin. However, it has permitted Bitcoin ETFs based on futures contracts. Speaking to Bloomberg, Hayden Hughes, co-founder of social-trading platform Alpha Impact <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-20/blackrock-s-surprising-bitcoin-etf-filing-helps-repair-grayscale-gbtc-discount" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The rally is backed by institutional demand. The BlackRock announcement on a Bitcoin ETF, plus EDX Markets, gave Bitcoin a boost on hopes that traditional institutions will add depth to the crypto market.”</p></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
</div>

</div>
<h2>SEC Hurdles</h2>
<p>As said the SEC has denied several applications for the spot Bitcoin ETF over the past few years. However, with the world&#8217;s top financial giants throwing their weight behind this, things could be a bit different this time.</p>
<p>Soon after the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/blackrock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlackRock</a> filing, there&#8217;s renewed optimism among Bitcoin investors. Interestingly, the share price of the Grayscale Bitcoin trust also rallied by a staggering 25% after the BlackRock filing. In the days following the submission of the iShares Bitcoin Trust application by the world&#8217;s largest ETF issuer, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (ticker GBTC), valued at $16.9 billion, has exhibited superior performance compared to the actual cryptocurrency. Consequently, the discount of GBTC&#8217;s underlying Bitcoin holdings has decreased to approximately 37%, compared to the 44% discount observed a week ago.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/opera-one-ai-integration-browser/">Opera Launches Opera One with Native Browser AI Integration</a></p>
<p>Opera has announced the Opera One browser, which includes a native integrated browser AI named Aria. <span style="font-weight: 400;">The software is the 100th version of the Opera browser, and it is also the first browser with a native integrated browser AI. This marks a major evolution in the company&#8217;s services, especially because it is coming at a time when a lot of companies are looking at how best to exploit the benefits of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/news/technology/artificial-intelligence-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">artificial intelligence</a> in their services. </span></p>
<p>Joanna Czajka, Product Director at Opera, stated in a <a href="https://press.opera.com/2023/06/20/introducing-opera-one/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8220;As people who obsess over browser innovation, we saw fit to rethink the role of the browser in light of the recent developments in the AI space. Unlike other browser companies, Opera didn&#8217;t simply add AI services to its browser. We went back to the drawing board and redesigned our flagship browser. Opera One is built around Aria, our native browser AI, and is the culmination of our work so far.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Opera One&#8217;s Native Integrated Browser AI</h2>
<p>Aria allows <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/everything-you-need-to-know-about-chatgpt-ai-chatbot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChatGPT</a> integration and offers users access to the service through a sidebar on the browser. It offers both web and browser capabilities, allowing users to collaborate with AI while searching for information. It has AI-controlled support, which uses Opera&#8217;s documented support database and up-to-date product knowledge in giving replies to users.</p>
<p>Users can fully control their access to the new product. They have the liberty to determine if they want to use Aria or not. To use the AI browser, they must click on a sidebar and sign up for a free account.</p>
<p>Opera One also has a feature called Tab Islands, which offers a new way of interacting with tabs. The feature arranges related tabs based on context to provide flexibility and organize the overall browsing experience. It also solves the problems users face when working on multiple tasks with many open tabs.</p>
<p>With the Tab Island feature, tabs with similar contexts will be kept together in the same tab island when researching related topics. This way, users can easily return to them and switch between tasks within the related tabs.</p>
<p>The product is available for free on Windows, MacOS, and Linux. It also offers users access to ChatGPT 3.5-level service and other AI features. There is no doubt that this launch will mark the beginning of other AI-related services and updates for the Opera browser.</p>
<p>Aria&#8217;s introduction is undoubtedly Opera&#8217;s response to changing users&#8217; needs and technological evolution. We expect competitors to launch products with similar AI features, especially if the product garners a lot of positive responses from customers.</p>

In early April, </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/alibaba-group/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Alibaba</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> began </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/alibaba-chatgpt-rival-tongyi-qianwen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">sending invitation codes</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to several top clients to test Tongyi Qianwen, a new AI application set to rival OpenAI’s ChatGPT. During its Alibaba Cloud Summit not long after, the company </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/alibaba-chatgpt-rival-english-chinese/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">revealed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the product and advertised its functionality. Alibaba said Tongyi Qianwen would be available on a few platforms before public release. The company also confirmed it would integrate the chatbot into all its products. However, Alibaba did not offer a deadline for the integration.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Stability AI also </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/stability-ai-chatgpt-stablelm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">launched</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> StableLM in April.

Vimeo’s script generator can produce scripts that match the user’s voice and general tone.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Regulatory Response to AI</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As AI becomes more popular, many of the world’s countries are trying to create laws to regulate the use of technology. The European Union (US) has taken the lead as its Parliament passed the </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/eu-parliament-ai-draft-act/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">EU AI Act</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to supervise the development and application of artificial intelligence in the region. Government officials considered the Act necessary as they worry that the unchecked spread of AI tools could cause harm.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to the Act, companies must properly label AI-generated content, and publish summaries of all data applied to AI training. The Act also bans any AI products that can be used to predict criminal behavior or influencer voter behavior.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Lawmakers in the US are also looking to officially regulate AI. Republican and Democrat senators are proposing a bill that establishes an AI oversight commission. The proposed National AI Commission Act would protect users from the possible dangers of unregulated AI applications.</span></p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/cisco-release-new-ai-chips/">Cisco Challenges Core Rivals with Release of New AI Chips</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Renowned American networking giant </span><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/cisco/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cisco Systems Inc</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (NASDAQ: CSCO) has recently unveiled its latest breakthrough &#8211; a new line of AI networking chips. These cutting-edge chips aim to enhance network performance, scalability, and intelligence, placing Cisco in direct competition with industry leaders such as </span><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/broadcom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Broadcom Inc</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (NASDAQ: AVGO) and Marvell Technology Inc (NASDAQ: MRVL). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a </span><a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/cisco-launches-new-ai-networking-chips-597137" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Cisco revealed that its SiliconOne series chips are currently being tested by five out of the six major cloud providers. Although the specific names of the companies were not disclosed, Bofa Global Research noted that Amazon Web Service (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, which collectively dominate the cloud computing market, are likely to be among the testers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cisco is a well-known producer of networking equipment. The company has established itself as a global leader in offering a wide range of networking solutions and equipment to enterprises, organizations, and service providers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, as the demand for AI applications such as ChatGPT continues to surge, the need for high-speed communication between individual chips has become paramount. Notably, AI applications heavily rely on the processing power of GPU clusters, which work collaboratively to handle complex computational tasks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recognizing this vital demand, Cisco unveiled its latest generation of ethernet switches, the G200 and G202. These new switches are twice as fast as their predecessors and can link up to 32,000 GPUs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, Cisco highlighted that these chips could make it possible to complete AI and machine learning activities with 40% fewer switches. By optimizing the network infrastructure, Cisco can save costs, enhance scalability, and improve overall network management efficiency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the firm has surpassed earnings and revenue estimates in its fiscal second quarter. According to an earlier </span><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/cisco-fiscal-q2-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Cisco earned $13.6 billion in revenue during the fiscal second quarter, a 7% rise year on year.</span></p>
<h2><b>Cisco System’s AI Competition with Broadcom and Marvell</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Broadcom and Marvell are well-established players in the networking chip market, known for their expertise in delivering high-performance solutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, Broadcom&#8217;s Jericho3-AI chip, introduced in April, represents a significant advancement in networking technology. With its ability to connect up to 32,000 GPU chips together, the Jericho3-AI chip opens up new possibilities for high-performance computing and AI applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, with the introduction of its AI networking chips, Cisco aims to challenge the dominance of Broadcom and Marvell by offering a unique blend of intelligence and versatility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, Cisco&#8217;s competition with Broadcom and Marvell could bring forth a healthy and dynamic market environment. The implications of this competition include accelerated technological advancements, expanded product offerings, shifts in market share dynamics, competitive pricing, and potential impact on industry standardization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, customers stand to benefit from this competition through access to innovative solutions, increased choice, and improved value for their networking chip investments.</span></p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ava-labs-ai-assistant/">Ava Labs Unveils Game-Changing AI Assistant for Core Web Users</a></p>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has taken another foray into the cryptocurrency industry, the latest to embrace this cutting-edge technology is Ava Labs, the brains behind the success of Avalanche blockchain. The software development company recently unveiled its newest addition: AvaGPT, a generative AI assistant to enhance user experiences.</p>
<p>In a lengthy Twitter thread on June 20, Ava Labs Core platform, which provides all-in-one command solutions for blockchain projects, including <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a>, announced the arrival of the generative AI tool. The chatbot is integrated into its platform. The Ava Labs-owned blockchain solution provider described the new AI assistant as the first AI-powered chatbot to live on a crypto web portfolio.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">💡Our AI-driven chatbot is trained on Core&#8217;s knowledge base, <a href="https://twitter.com/avax?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@avax</a> documentation and developer docs. Use it to discover quick insights, receive real-time support, or access in-depth source information links fast.</p>
<p>— Core 🦉 (@coreapp) <a href="https://twitter.com/coreapp/status/1671207847940751360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 20, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Trained with the knowledge of Core, Avax documentations, and developer docs, the latest AI technology aims to open up exciting possibilities for users interacting with the Avax protocol, empowering them with a sophisticated and intuitive virtual companion while providing real-time support and access to in-depth information.  With its deep learning capabilities, AvaGPT can promptly understand and respond to user queries, providing valuable information and aiding in their decision-making processes.</p>
<h2>AI Assistant Will Not Replace Customer Support</h2>
<p>Kieran McShane, the Technical Product Manager at Ava Labs, exclusively told the crypto news media <a href="https://decrypt.co/145533/ava-labs-ai-chatbot-avagpt-crypto-network" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Decrypt</a> that AvaGPT was developed in collaboration with Kapa AI, the trusted service provider for <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/everything-you-need-to-know-about-chatgpt-ai-chatbot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChatGPT. </a></p>
<p>McShane emphasized the tireless dedication of Ava Labs&#8217; support team and engineers, who played a pivotal role in bringing the new AI technology to live.</p>
<p>Under their skilled leadership, the development process ensured the smooth integration of AvaGPT and its optimal functionality within the Core platform.</p>
<p>He further noted that the chatbot would not replace the company&#8217;s support team despite the new AI chatbot being created to support users.</p>
<p>&#8220;The two things [AvaGPT] provides is answering general questions for Avalanche users quickly while letting them still access our support team. It was out of an effort to help answer questions quicker and get to the source material immediately,&#8221; McShane said.</p>
<h2>AI Tools Continues to Make Entrance into Crypto</h2>
<p>As one of the popular blockchain ecosystems in the cryptoverse, Ava Labs&#8217; latest innovative approach reflects the company&#8217;s commitment to pushing the boundaries of technology and ensuring that their users stay at the forefront of the rapidly evolving industry.</p>
<p>The New York-based software development firm launched its Avalanche blockchain in 2020. Since then, the protocol has positioned itself as one of the top crypto projects built on the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.</p>
<p>However, the company is not the first to exploit the generative AI market to assist its users.</p>
<p>Last month, another blockchain protocol, Solana, incorporated an open-source AI plugin into its ecosystem. According to the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/solana-ai-chatgpt-plug-in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> by Solana Foundation, the non-profit organization (NGO) overseeing the layer-1 protocol, the new plugin is powered by ChatGPT and is available for download on GitHub.</p>
<p>The AI plugin currently supports the listing and buying of non-fungible tokens (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFTs</a>), transferring assets, inspecting transactions, and interpreting public account data on Solana.</p>
<p>Aside from blockchain projects, other centralized exchanges also actively engage with AI tools. So far, popular crypto exchanges such as Binance, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bybit-chatgpt-trading-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bybit, </a>and Crypto.com have integrated AI assistants on their various platforms to aid customer experience.</p>

<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/gbtc-surge-trading-volume/">GBTC Sees Over 400% Surge in Trading Volume in 5 Days, Here&#8217;s Why</a></p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/gbtc-surge-trading-volume/">GBTC Sees Over 400% Surge in Trading Volume in 5 Days, Here&#8217;s Why</a></p>
<p>Grayscale&#8217;s Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) is currently enjoying some attention from investors, and its trading volume is a testament to this fact. This follows after GBTC&#8217;s trading volume spiked by over 400% within the last week.</p>
<p>As of June 14, the daily trading volume of GBTC was still standing at $16.1 million. However, in just 5 days, that volume surged massively to about $80 million.</p>
<h2>Why Is GBTC Trading So Much?</h2>
<p>It might be interesting to note that asset management firm BlackRock <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1980994/000143774923017574/bit20230608_s1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed</a> for a spot Bitcoin ETF on June 15. That has undoubtedly brought renewed hope that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>) may finally approve one.</p>
<p>If that is the case, then Grayscale itself can be optimistic about its proposal to convert GBTC into a spot bitcoin ETF. Although Grayscale, like many others, has had its proposal rejected by the SEC up until this moment. The SEC has always cited that its disapproval of spot Bitcoin ETF applications thus far hinges on the fear of market manipulation, among other things. Grayscale, however, has sued the regulator since the last rejection and has filed a suit against the SEC.</p>
<p>Furthermore, unconfirmed <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/fidelity-investments-big-crypto-move/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> filtered out earlier this week that claims Fidelity might be planning to acquire Grayscale. If that also turns out to be true, then that helps GBTC&#8217;s cause with the SEC, especially with regard to Fidelity&#8217;s repute as an old, traditional firm.</p>
<p>Whatever might be the case, there is a general sense of optimism around BlackRock being successful in its bid for a spot Bitcoin ETF. And when that happens, it is expected to pave the way for Grayscale to get its non-redeemable trust shares changed, too.</p>
<p>This is why GBTC is currently exchanging hands at such a massive rate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-lawmakers-national-ai-commission-act/">US Lawmakers Propose National AI Commission Act</a></p>
<p>Some lawmakers from the Democratic and Republican groups are proposing a bill to form a commission that will oversee the country’s approach to Artificial Intelligence (AI). The commission is to create some form of regulation about the use of AI.</p>
<p>The United States’ response to regulating the use of AI came under what could be called the bipartisan National AI Commission Act. Representatives at the heart of this include Ted Lieu, Anna Eshoo, and Ken Buck.</p>
<h2>The Rise of AIs and the Need to Regulate Them</h2>
<p>Many hot topics in the tech world in 2023 have centered around <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/news/technology/artificial-intelligence-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI</a>. In 2022, many of them were created to simplify tasks in various industries. One of the most popular AIs launched in late 2022 was <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/everything-you-need-to-know-about-chatgpt-ai-chatbot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChatGPT</a>, created by OpenAI. Not long after, talks about Google’s Bard AI and some of its new AI features started coming to light.</p>
<p>Many companies are already shifting their attention to how AI can make their tasks more efficient. As a result, different AIs that carry out tasks that humans have been employed for started to come to light, raising the argument that they could displace humans from their jobs in a few years.</p>
<p>Even though many of these AI solutions are created with good intentions, without much control and guidelines, they could be abused. This has raised the need to regulate their use.</p>
<p>The proposed bill covers the possible risks associated with creating and using AI. It intends to protect users from potential harm arising from using them freely without regulations.</p>
<p>According to Lieu, “Artificial Intelligence is doing amazing things for our society. It can also cause significant harm if left unchecked and unregulated. Congress must not stay on the sidelines.”</p>
<p>In achieving this, the commission is looking to meet with experts, key industry figures, government officials, and stakeholders to provide useful recommendations for the most effective ways to regulate them.</p>
<h2>Notable Figures Support the National AI Commission Act</h2>
<p>Gary Marcus, a Professor Emeritus at New York University who also co-authored ‘Rebooting AI,’ spoke about the likelihood of AI affecting society in a good and bad way and agreed that the United States needs to have an AI strategy with the best interests of its citizens at heart. He also agrees that the bipartisan National AI Commission Act is a good move towards meeting the urgent need.</p>
<p>Merve Hickok, the President of the Center for AI and Digital Policy, expressed his support for the National AI Commission Act. In his <a href="https://lieu.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/reps-lieu-buck-eshoo-and-sen-schatz-introduce-bipartisan-bicameral-bill" target="_blank" rel="noopener">words</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We have warned that the United States is not prepared to meet the AI challenges ahead. A National AI Commission would be a step in the right direction.”</p></blockquote>
<p>He sees the proposal as relevant and needed at the moment, as there has been a need to create the necessary guidelines and boundaries for using AI and also consider the public’s interests and concerns.</p>

<p>Bitcoin (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC</a>), the leading cryptocurrency, has experienced a remarkable surge in recent days, with its price <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/markets/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">coming in at $28,887.88</a>, up by 8.03% within a 24-hour period and by 11.44% over the last week. The revival in the price of Bitcoin has marked a significant pivot point for most altcoins which are now printing their multiweek high at the moment.</p>
<p>These significant gains have once again captured the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike, as Bitcoin&#8217;s market value has now reached an impressive 51%.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Surge Fueled by ETF Filings</h2>
<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1671332241174310915" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">highlighted</a> by Wu Blockchain, one crucial factor that has contributed to Bitcoin’s recent surge is the growing acceptance and adoption of crypto by mainstream institutions. Notably, the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/blackrock-spot-bitcoin-etf-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entry</a> of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/blackrock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlackRock Inc</a> (NYSE: BLK) into the Spot Bitcoin ETF pursuit has helped to legitimize Bitcoin as a viable investment option, instilling confidence in potential investors.</p>
<p>Four notable investment management firms, iShares, Bitwise, WisdomTree, and Invesco, have just submitted proposals for a Bitcoin ETF, signaling a significant advance in the crypto business.</p>
<p>Bitwise, a prominent crypto asset management company, has also <a href="https://www.pionline.com/exchange-traded-funds/bitwise-makes-fresh-attempt-offer-spot-bitcoin-etf-after-blackrock-filing" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">applied</a> for the inclusion of Bitwise&#8217;s Bitcoin ETP Trust on a major stock exchange like NYSE Arca. If approved by the SEC, the proposed exchange-traded product (ETP) would provide investors with a convenient and regulated vehicle to gain exposure to Bitcoin&#8217;s price movements without directly owning the crypto.</p>
<p>Similarly, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/invesco/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Invesco Ltd</a> (NYSE: IVZ), a renowned global asset management organization with over $1.5 trillion in Assets Under Management (AUM), has made a brave foray into the realm of Bitcoin ETFs. Invesco&#8217;s decision to enter the Bitcoin ETF market with its substantial AUM is a result of careful analysis and strategic planning.</p>
<p>As an investment giant, Invesco is known for its meticulous assessment of market trends and thorough evaluation of potential opportunities. The company&#8217;s move to apply for a Bitcoin ETF suggests that it has conducted extensive research and analysis to identify the long-term potential and viability of Bitcoin.</p>
<h2>SEC Identifies Altcoins as Securities</h2>
<p>In a related development, the US <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) has recently identified a substantial number of altcoins as securities. This classification has significant implications for the regulatory treatment of these assets, as securities fall under specific regulatory frameworks designed to protect investors.</p>
<p>Some of the assets tagged as security by the market regulator include Cardano (ADA), Solana (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/solana/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SOL</a>), and Polygon (MATIC) amongst others.</p>
<p>The SEC&#8217;s identification of altcoins as securities means that issuers of these cryptocurrencies must comply with applicable securities laws and regulations. This increased scrutiny could lead to stricter oversight, including registration requirements, disclosures, and investor protection measures. The classification of altcoins as securities also poses potential challenges for their trading on crypto exchanges and may limit their availability to retail investors.</p>
