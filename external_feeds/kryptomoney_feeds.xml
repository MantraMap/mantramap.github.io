<p>Coinbase Global Inc., an American publicly traded trading platform, has been named in a new<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/koqcuqyj47fvhlv/AADXxp8HCyvwKFQtd1wws_WVa?dl=0&amp;preview=001_2023.01.13_complaint.pdf"> class action lawsuit</a> for failing to provide two airdrops including Flare Network&#8217;s native token, FLR, and the accompanying Songbird (SGB) token. The lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.<br /><br />According to the case filed by HODL LAW CALI, the plaintiff&#8217;s attorney, Dallas Woody, and anyone who may join in, Coinbase has broken its agreement to participate in the Flare Network airdrop, which it promised in December 2021. According to the lawsuit, the Flare Network airdrop was supposed to be dispersed to every XRP holder based on a snapshot of account balances. <br /><br />The terms noted that the Songbird token would be distributed first, followed by the deposit of FLR tokens for all users. According to the lawsuit, despite receiving distribution of both SGB and FLR tokens before the latter&#8217;s distribution on January 9 of this year, the trading platform has refused to give it to all qualified clients.<br /><br />As seen in the lawsuit, rival exchanges have transferred their received FLR and SGB tokens to eligible users, and Coinbase&#8217;s delay or failure to do so on time has cost clients some money. The defendant is requesting that the court order Coinbase to credit customers&#8217; tokens and compensate them for any losses they may have suffered.<br /><br />The<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/flare-networks-to-bridge-ripple-and-ethereum-ecosystems/"> Flare Network</a> airdrop has recently become one of the most acclaimed in the digital currency industry, with several trading firms expressing support. Despite the participation of exchanges such as Binance, the Flare Token experienced a large drop as many beneficiaries sold the tokens as soon as they received them.</p>

<p>The world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/binance-acknowledges-busd-peg-issues-says-not-always-been-fully-backed/"> Binance</a> is still aiming to lower the total number of BNB in circulation to 100 million. To accomplish this, the firm announced the completion of the 22nd burn of its native token.<br /><br />According to Binance&#8217;s statement, it has pulled 2.064 million BNB from circulation, which is worth over $620 million at today&#8217;s prices.</p>

— Binance (@binance) <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1615272723885727745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 17, 2023</a></blockquote>
<p>The<a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1615272723885727745"> 22nd burn</a> was the largest in terms of BNB tokens since the record-breaking 14th two years ago. The Pioneer Burn Program was responsible for 7,181 of the 2.064 burns that occurred today. The service, which was introduced in 2020, intends to assist customers who have lost access to their BNB tokens when they submit requests through the customer service page and are accepted by the exchange.<br /><br />The <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/binance-completes-quarterly-burn-with-over-2-million-bnb-burned/">Pioneer Burn Program</a> operates in tandem with the other BNB burning processes. Binance&#8217;s native crypto, like the rest of the market, has been on a run since the beginning of the year. It began in 2023 at roughly $240 but quickly skyrocketed by double digits.<br /><br />This resulted in a rise of $315 on Saturday, marking the highest price for BNB since late November 2022. Barring a modest retracement, the asset is currently trading above $300.</p>

<ul>
<li>Chiliz (CHZ) is up 20.5% in the past seven days at $0.136</li>
<li>The 10,000,000th transaction on the Chiliz Scoville Testnet has been surpassed</li>
<li>Users can now own the game-scored balls from the SerieA Super Cup</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/chz-price-analysis-chiliz-price-jumps-15-in-week-amid-fresh-wave-of-hype-ahead-of-fifa-world-cup-2022/">Chiliz (CHZ)</a> is up 20.5% in the past seven days at $0.136, but trades down at 1.49% in the last 24 hours. Chilizle Chain 2.0 has reached a new milestone ahead of its release. In a Twitter announcement, the 10,000,000th transaction on the Chiliz Scoville Testnet has been surpassed. In March 2022, Chiliz announced the launch of <em>&#8220;Scoville,&#8221;</em> the public testnet for Chiliz Chain 2.0 and the first Layer-1 blockchain created especially for the sports and entertainment industries. Developed in collaboration with Ankr, a leading provider of decentralized infrastructure, CC2 is EVM compatible with gas fees up to 200x cheaper than ETH. In a move that is deemed the world’s first, users can now own the game-scored balls from the Serie A Super Cup as the Socios collectibles launch. According to the announcement, only fan token holders will be able to win the real balls from the goals. The first drop gives fans a chance to own a game-scored ball from the EA Sports Super Cup Final between AC Milan and Inter. The EA Sports Supercup final paves the way for the first-ever Socios.com collectibles, and its final will be played on Wednesday, January 18.</p>
<p><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $0.2400, $0.2000, $0.1500<br />Support Levels: $0.1000, $0.0761, $0.0500</p>
<h4>CHZ/USD Daily Chart: Ranging</h4>

<p>Chiliz (CHZ) achieved a daily high of $0.1443 in the prior week before retracing to $0.1314 on Monday as bulls aim to convert this $0.1500 zone into support ahead of a move higher. A break of the moving average (MA 200) threshold near $0.1700 could provide market players with the impetus needed to move the pair higher. Daily, the RSI indicator is currently above 60, indicating a buy signal.<br /><br />If the market confirms overbought conditions, a minor retreat is not out of the question shortly. This, however, may present a buy-the-dip opportunity. In the event of a pullback below the moving average (MA 500), the $0.1000 might provide quick support to the CHZ price. Otherwise, the bears may target the $0.076 low if they continue to push lower in unfamiliar terrain.</p>
<h4>CHZ/USD 4-Hour Chart: Ranging</h4>

<p>On the 4-hour chart, the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/chz-price-analysis-chiliz-rebounds-from-lows-fc-barcelona-fan-token-powered-by-chiliz-goes-live-on-binance/">CHZ/USD</a> pair is rising in a positive trend. It&#8217;s upside resistance is yet to be broken, as the CHZ price is rising. A break over the $0.1500 barrier should signal a continued rise toward the $0.200 level. Otherwise, if the price retraces to the psychological level of $0.100, we may witness another push to the low, impacting the current trend negatively.<br /><br />If the price continues to fall, the $0.076 level may provide support. Only a break below this support would give bears greater momentum to target the $0.05 level. Overall, Chiliz is still on the rise, aided by good fundamentals in the fan token sector. A retreat may produce a consolidation pattern before the continuation of the trend.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/polygonhederatron-see-large-scale-adoption-from-countries-heres-how-they-are-being-utilized/">Polygon,</a> an Ethereum scaling solution, will hard fork its proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain to handle gas spikes and chain reorganization. The proposed hard fork is scheduled for January 17. It said in a <a href="https://polygon.technology/blog/hardfork-incoming-upgrading-polygon-pos-chain-to-boost-performance">blog post</a> that it will modify its software to solve gas spikes and chain reorganizations (reorgs).<br /><br />The first phase of the hard fork will involve a change in how the blockchain calculates gas fees. Gas fees are a type of tax paid to a blockchain to transact on it. Polygon&#8217;s goal with the fork is to decrease gas price spikes that might occur when there is a lot of activity on the chain.</p>

<p>Although gas will still increase during peak demand, it will be more in line with the way Ethereum gas dynamics work now. The goal is to smooth out spikes and ensure a more seamless experience when interacting with the chain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Polygon said that a reduction in gas fee spikes will be achieved by doubling the value of the “BaseFeeChangeDenominator,” which the company says will “help smooth out the increase or decrease rate of the baseFee for when the gas exceeds or falls below the target gas limits in a block.” The project believes the modification will be successful as it backtested such changes “against historical Polygon PoS mainnet data.”<br /><br />The second suggested portion of the hard fork will deal with reorgs, which can happen when a validator node—a computer that runs the blockchain—receives information that can temporarily generate a new version of the blockchain. Reorganizations might occur as a result of network faults or malicious activities. A reorg can result in lost or duplicate transactions for as long as it lasts.<br /><br />To address this issue, Polygon aims to minimize the time it takes to finish a block to validate a successful transaction, and the hard fork will cut Polygon&#8217;s &#8220;sprint length&#8221; from 64 to 16 blocks, implying that a block producer can create blocks for a considerably shorter period.<br /><br />Hard forks differ from soft forks in that they are not backward-compatible and will require all network node operators to update to the most recent software at a predetermined period. To prepare for the hard fork, all Polygon node operators will need to upgrade their nodes before the scheduled date. Holders of Polygon&#8217;s native token, <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/matic-price-analysis-matic-moves-near-1-bitpay-announces-support-for-polygon-making-it-available-for-merchants/">MATIC</a>, will not be affected and will not need to take any action. Decentralized apps, such as Web3 games, will be unaffected and will not need to take any action.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-miners-secure-1-09-billion-mining-revenue-in-january/">Bitcoin miners</a> were impacted in 2022. Several mining giants were knocked off by what appeared to be a year of adequate capital for expansion, high energy prices, increasing competition, and a bear market.<br /><br />After a slumber, Bitcoin miners have returned, with mining difficulty increased by more than 10%, from 34.09 trillion to 37.59 trillion, according to data provided by <a href="https://btc.com/stats/diff">BTC.com</a>.<br /><br />Following the news, f2pool, a major participant in the industry, <a href="https://twitter.com/f2pool_official/status/1614832488370798592">tweeted</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Bitcoin mining difficulty increased by 10.26%, to an ATH! In this 2-week cycle, If BTC can go up above $23,000, machines that are more efficient than 40W/T can be running with profits at the electricity of $0.08/kWh.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The statistic that defines how difficult it is to mine a Bitcoin block comes during a bullish reversal in the market behavior of the digital asset.<br /><br />Bitcoin, which is currently trading at $21,175, has managed to recoup losses from the two-month-old collapse of Sam Bankman&#8217;s crypto Fried&#8217;s empire. The next difficulty modification is expected in two weeks, which could result in a tiny decrease of 0.02%, at least for the time being.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Bitcoin&#8217;s mining hash rate achieved two new highs in only two weeks, although bankrupt miner Core Scientific turned off 9,000 ASICs in December.</p>
<p>This trend could indicate that hash is shifting from weak to powerful hands. Bitcoin&#8217;s hash rate is now sitting around 271.86 EH/s.</p>
<p>In terms of mining pool distribution, Foundry USA has the largest share with 35.5%, followed by AntPool (20.9%), Binance Pool (12.3%), and f2pool (10.4%), among others.</p>

<ul>
<li>The price of Ethereum (ETH) has increased by up to 22% weekly</li>
<li>The Total Value of the ETH 2.0 Deposit Contract has just reached an ATH of 16,042,407 ETH</li>
<li>Ethereum on-chain data shows a significant increase in the number of Ether shark addresses</li>
</ul>
<p>In the past seven days, the price of Ethereum (ETH) has increased by up to 22%, propelled by an improving macroeconomic outlook and growing interest in Ethereum&#8217;s planned <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ethereum-devs-move-ahead-with-shanghai-upgrade-to-enable-withdrawals-bitcoin-still-weak-analyst-plan-b-says/">Shanghai upgrade.</a> ETH was marginally up in the last 24 hours at $1,545. The Total Value of the ETH 2.0 Deposit Contract has just reached an ATH of 16,042,407 ETH, according to Glassnode data. Now, all eyes are on Ethereum&#8217;s upcoming significant upgrade, known as the<em> &#8220;Shanghai hard fork,&#8221;</em> which is anticipated to occur in March and will enable users of the network to access ether (ETH) they had staked on the blockchain but have been unable to access for months. In December, it was decided to move forward with Shanghai. According to a statement by Messari research analyst Kunal Goel, the total quantity of ethereum staked might probably rise after Shanghai. Crypto trader Thomas Kralow claims that if the Shanghai upgrade is successful, it will pave the groundwork for proto-danksharding, also known as EIP-4844, which would make Ethereum more scalable through sharding, later this year. In the weeks leading up to its March hard fork, Ethereum on-chain data shows a significant increase in the number of Ether shark addresses.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels:$2,300 $2,000, $1,700<br />Support Levels: $1,500, $1,300, $1,000</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ethereum-eth-sees-another-bull-favoring-element-as-on-chain-analytics-indicate-increased-blockchain-activity/">Ethereum (ETH)</a> traded in an upside range throughout the week as both volatility and volume increased significantly. To sustain a string of higher lows and higher highs, ETH/USD must keep today&#8217;s daily candle above the $1,500 level of support while the recovery from $1,200 continues to move higher. If this is not done, downside price goals of $1,300 and $1,200 might be attempted.<br /><br />The bull market started when a daily close occurred above $1,300, while the $1,200 low was more of a bear trap than a negative reversal. If bears return to the market, the decline should be contained to the first downward support level at $1,300. Investors&#8217; attention will be on closing much above the $1,500 level today.</p>

<p>ETH/USD has broken above the $1,500 resistance line, which has since turned into short-term support, far above the 4-hour moving average (MA 50 &amp; MA 200). Given that the pair&#8217;s relative strength index indicator remains above its 80 overbought regions. Despite signs of an overbought market in the near term, most investors prefer to maintain a positive outlook for ETH.<br /><br />If selling pressure picks up again, the pair may try to reach, if not break, the $1,300 support level, while a higher break may see Ether smash the $2,000 psychological barrier and open the door for the $2,500 barrier. Overall, only a successful break of the target at $2,000 might sustain the present bullish sentiment among traders.</p>

<ul>
<li>Bitcoin increased over $21,000 on January 14</li>
<li>At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $21,002</li>
<li>Someone purchased BTC futures worth almost $4B in market orders</li>
</ul>
<p>In a weekend move,<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-blasts-past-mastercard-as-value-soars-to-20000/"> Bitcoin</a> increased over $21,000 on January 14, following hopes that inflation has peaked and the market has bottomed. The largest cryptocurrency rose by up to 7.5% to $21,299 before easing slightly. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $21,002. Since November 8, it hadn&#8217;t risen beyond $20,000, and Saturday marked the 11th day in a row of gains. Data from <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/">CoinGecko</a> shows that the total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency industry surpassed $1 trillion for the first time since early November. Using onchain data, Ki Young Ju, CEO of Cryptoquant, noted that someone purchased BTC futures worth almost $4 billion in market orders in the lead-up to the Bitcoin rally, and millions worth of short positions have been liquidated on all exchanges. Ki Young Ju also highlighted one important indicator: premium has returned, favoring Bitcoin bulls, indicating a positive shift in sentiment for Bitcoin in the US. <em>&#8220;Bitcoin market sentiment turned positive in the US. It was traded over +1.27% premium per minute on Coinbase as of Jan 13th, 2023 at 19:38 EST&#8221;</em> Ki Young Ju tweeted.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $27,000, $25,000, $22,000<br />Support Levels: $20,000, $18,500, $16,500</p>

<p>On the daily chart, the price rebound past the moving average (MA 200) denotes bullish pressure. As the No. 1 cryptocurrency fought to maintain its position above the support level of $20,000, which served as a barrier between the high of last November and mid-October, near-term selling activity also eased, thanks to an increase in positive actions and a decrease in negative momentum.<br /><br />Overall, after falling to $15,460, Bitcoin has recovered some of its losses. Buyers&#8217; emergence around the $17,500 handle may try to sustain the positive rebound because the loss produced a yearly low. The bullish Relative Strength Index, which indicates a continuation in the rising momentum, might hasten the rebound toward the $25,000 zone</p>

<p>The short-term oscillators currently indicate bulls are encouraging further increases in the pair over the $20,000 level. Bears may sell, though, if the price rises over the next horizontal resistance, which is $22,000. Initial upside friction may start near $25,000 if buyers are successful in extending the rebound toward this area.<br /><br />Otherwise, first support could come from the $20,000 level, with lower support at $18,500 if positive factors begin to fade. And should the downward trend continue, the price may aim for the $17,500 short-term moving average (MA 50 &amp; MA 200) zone. For bulls to outnumber bears on the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/btc-price-analysis-bitcoin-tackles-barrier-at-17000-current-bear-market-ranks-second-largest-in-history-per-this-metric/">BTC/USD</a> pair, buyers must push the price over the $25,000 level.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Shaktikanta Das, governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), advocated for a ban on cryptocurrencies at a recent conference, according to a Jan. 13 story from<a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/rbi-governor-shaktikanta-das-cryptocurrency-should-be-banned-similar-to-gambling-2321280-2023-01-13"> India Today.</a><br /><br />The central bank&#8217;s position on cryptocurrencies, according to Das, <em>&#8220;is very clear—it should be banned.&#8221;</em> He continued by claiming that cryptocurrencies  <em>&#8220;does not have any underlying value&#8221;</em> and that their value is based on<em> &#8220;make-believe&#8221;</em><br /><br /><em>&#8220;To put it bluntly, it is gambling,&#8221;</em> said Das, noting that gambling is prohibited in India. His remarks reaffirm a comparable analogy made by politician Sushil Kumar Modi of Bihar in April. Even though some Indian states permit betting and lotteries, the activity is mostly outlawed and there is a large-scale problem with illegal gambling there.<br /><br />The <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/indian-supreme-court-rules-rbi-crypto-ban-unconstitutional/">RBI</a>, which serves as India&#8217;s central bank and monetary authority, was also concerned that allowing bitcoin may weaken its position. He cautioned that cryptocurrency could result in India losing control over the money supply.<br /><br />He stated that the introduction of cryptocurrencies could result in dollarization, wherein foreign U.S. currency will replace the Indian rupee more and more.<br /><br />Indirectly referring to the recent collapse of FTX and the ensuing slump in the cryptocurrency market, he said that the RBI has previously warned of a crypto collapse. He said, <em>&#8220;If you see the developments, I think I don’t need to add anything more,&#8221;</em><br /><br />Since at least late 2021, Das and the RBI have indeed issued comparable cautions. In December of last year, Das made a personal appeal for a crypto prohibition.<br /><br />India has not yet expressly outlawed the usage of cryptocurrencies, despite numerous allegations to the contrary. Additionally, Das appears to be in favor of some blockchain applications, and India is working to regulate CBDCs.<br /><br />However, the nation will begin taxing capital gains from cryptocurrency trading at a relatively high rate of 30% in 2022 (along with a 1% transaction tax).</p>

<p>According to a recent announcement, <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/hbar-price-analysis-will-hbar-make-a-comeback-in-2023-popular-avalanche-based-dex-launches-on-hedera/">Hedera</a> will start quarterly resets of the testnet on January 26, 2023, from 17:00 to 19:00 UTC, during which the testnet will be unavailable. Resetting the Hedera testnet regularly guarantees that old data is cleared out, spam is eliminated, and the system is kept up to date.</p>
<p>Attempts will be made by Hedera Core Engineering to make testnet resets as developer-friendly as feasible. Dates for testnet resets will be announced at least two weeks in advance through email to testnet users, the Hedera Network Status website, and the official Hedera developer Discord.</p>
<p>Owners of testnet mirror nodes will be given advance notice of the availability of their mirror nodes and instructions to configure them before the planned reset. This scheduled maintenance affects Hedera Testnet (v0.33.3), Individual Nodes, Hedera-Managed Mirror Node Testnet APIs (v0.71.0), and Hedera Testnet (v0.33.3).</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Cash and Polygon To Undergo Hard Forks in 2023</h2>
<p>A hard fork upgrade of <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/matic-price-analysis-polygon-shares-upcoming-expectations-for-2023-how-will-matic-price-react-going-forward/">Polygon</a>, Ethereum&#8217;s layer 2 scaling solution, is planned for 2023. A proposed hard fork to Polygon&#8217;s proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain has been made public.</p>
<p>The software change is scheduled to take place on January 17 if approved, and it will address gas price increases and chain rearrangements (reorgs). The Polygon community was initially made aware of the hard fork debate in December 2022.</p>
<p>The first modification in Polygon&#8217;s new split relates to how gas fees, a form of tax one must pay to a blockchain to conduct transactions, are set. Polygon hopes that the fork will reduce gas price increases that occur when there is a lot going on in the chain.</p>
<p>The second suggested improvement deals with reorgs, which can happen when one of the machines running the Polygon blockchain, a validator node, receives data that momentarily produces a new version of the blockchain.</p>
<p>Due to the necessity for nodes to reconcile which chain is the right one (also known as the &#8220;canonical&#8221; one), such an event makes it challenging to accurately verify whether a transaction has been accomplished.</p>
<p>Polygon seeks to shorten the time it takes to finalize a block and verify successful transactions to solve its issue of relatively frequent reorgs. The goal is to decrease Polygon&#8217;s &#8220;sprint length&#8221; from 64 to 16 blocks, allowing block producers to manufacture blocks in considerably less time (from 128 to 32 seconds).</p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin Cash Hard fork</strong><br />The<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bch-price-analysis-explosive-move-towards-1200-unique-eth-web3-compatible-sidechain-launches-on-bitcoin-cash/"> Bitcoin Cash</a> fork is anticipated to take place in May 2023. With plans for &#8220;CashTokens,&#8221; which, according to developers, would enable decentralized applications directly on Bitcoin Cash, the hard split is expected to increase the network&#8217;s security and anonymity.</p>
<p>Smaller transaction sizes, which speed up transaction times, and smart contracts functionality, which could enable the development of Bitcoin Cash-based applications that provide users with opportunities for crowdfunding, recurring payments, and derivatives trading, among other uses, are other proposed improvements that have already been locked in.</p>

<p>After U.S. markets closed, Bitcoin was up 6% in 24 hours, trading at about $19,982, as traditional markets recovered earlier losses to close higher. Per <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">CoinMarketCap</a>, the largest cryptocurrency has increased by over 18% during the last seven days.<br /><br />According to data from <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/">companiesmarketcap.com</a>, Bitcoin, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency, has eclipsed banking behemoth Mastercard in terms of market value.<br /><br />The flagship cryptocurrency is now worth $372 billion after reaching an intraday high of $20,000 on the Bitstamp platform. Before that, Bitcoin outperformed significant companies like Meta Platforms, Eli Lilly, and Chevron, with bulls finally on a winning streak after months of disappointing market action.<br /><br />The largest cryptocurrency is now closing in on Tesla, the leading e-car manufacturer. Tesla&#8217;s stock took a beating last year, with the firm losing the majority of its market capitalization and CEO Elon Musk became the first person in history to lose $200 billion.<br /><br /><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/why-mana-exploded-by-70-bitcoin-reaches-20k-as-metaverse-tokens-sand-axs-magic-rally/">Bitcoin</a> has fallen more than 72% from its all-time high. In November 2021, the company&#8217;s market valuation topped $3 trillion. The market cap of a corporation is derived by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by the stock price per share. In other words, it shows the overall value assigned to a company by investors depending on current market conditions. Bitcoin&#8217;s market capitalization is derived by multiplying the total number of coins (or tokens) by the current market price per unit.<br /><br />This statistic can change daily, as any shift in investor sentiment or changes in the stock price will have an immediate impact on the company&#8217;s overall market capitalization. Apple is currently the most valuable firm in the world, with a market worth of more than $2.1 trillion.</p>
