										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite lessening activity in the arena of decentralized finance (defi), some companies – like Giddy – are remaining afloat and <a href="https://invezz.com/news/2023/05/17/interview-a-defi-startup-amid-crypto-winter/">establishing solid records</a> for themselves.</p>
<h2>How Giddy is Holding Its Ground</h2>
<p>Giddy is described as a self-custody smart wallet. Run by its CEO and co-founder Eric Parker, the company seeks to make wallet experiences easy for everyone following a very bearish year in 2022. In a recent interview, Parker – when asked how Giddy makes money – answered:</p>
<blockquote><p>Same way MetaMask, Coinbase, Beefy, Uniswap, and Infura do. Fiat ramps, defi transactions, gas payments, and crypto trading, except we’ve built solutions to these tech stacks ourselves which means we can charge the customer less per service, saving our users time and money all while making crypto and defi much easier.</p></blockquote>
<p>Over the past 1.5 years, the total value locked in <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/defi/">defi</a> has fallen to about $47 billion from $165 billion. Discussing how he continues to attract customers, Parker said:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s important to note that unsustainable defi yields have fallen, while the fundamentally sound projects remain strong. One million percent annual yield was never sustainable, which is why the smartest defi users today are seeking real yield. In other words, sustainable business models built on the blockchain. Users can still earn incredible yields on the blockchain while maintaining exposure to the best assets such as USDC, Ethereum, Matic, and bitcoin.</p></blockquote>
<p>He was also asked why he thinks so many people have had serious wallet issues and what he’s doing to make their experiences easier. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’re still so, so early. It’s like having to program your own modem to connect to the internet in the early 80’s, then moving to services like AOL, then Netscape, and so on. I think today in the crypto space, we’re just starting to move into more user-friendly technology abstractions, and it’s only going to get better from here. Giddy was created specifically to tackle this issue, and we’ve developed new technology to do so. We already hinted at our private key tech, which is fundamentally a better experience for users, but there’s also our one-tap staking into defi earning protocols, plus the ability to pay for gas with USDC or our Giddy token. Quality of life improvements such as these mean people don’t have to worry about losing their seed phrase, don’t have to worry about running out of gas, and don’t have to worry about signing a malicious smart contract or leaving infinite approvals open on the blockchain, and that’s just the start.</p></blockquote>
<h2>A Few Tricks Up Its Sleeve?</h2>
<p>Regarding how Giddy makes a name for itself when there are so many competitors, Parker said:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s a noisy space, but we’ve got some unique advantages… Nobody else is integrating directly with defi protocols, making defi yield as easy as a single tap.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tether – one of the largest and most popular stable currencies around – has announced plans to open a huge bitcoin mining facility in the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/30/stablecoin-giant-tether-to-mine-bitcoin-in-uruguay-using-renewables.html">South American region</a> of Uruguay. The clincher? The company is going to operate the facility only using renewable energy.</p>
<h2>Tether to Mine Bitcoin in South America</h2>
<p>This is a big deal in that bitcoin and crypto mining operations have gotten a bad rap over the last several years on account of the high number of reports that have been produced alleging they use too much energy and are putting the planet in harm’s way. It’s alleged in these documents, for example, that many third-world or developing nations do not use the energy that bitcoin and crypto mining firms use.</p>
<p>This attitude has made its way into the minds of top investors like Kevin O’Leary of “Shark Tank” fame, who said a few years <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/report-bitcoin-mining-may-require-more-energy-than-180-countries/">back that he would no</a> longer be buying any more crypto mined in China given the nation’s track record with green energy wasn’t the best.</p>
<p>In addition, men like Elon Musk – the South African billionaire and entrepreneur behind companies such as SpaceX and Tesla – have also taken issue with the present mining arena. Not long ago, Musk said he would allow Tesla buyers to engage in <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/elon-musk-permits-bitcoin-payments-for-tesla-vehicles/">vehicle transactions using</a> bitcoin.</p>
<p>However, his decision was <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-has-taken-a-nasty-stumble-many-are-blaming-elon-musk/">quickly rescinded given</a> he was concerned about the energy use of bitcoin mining, and he wasn’t willing to change his mind unless miners became more transparent about their sources.</p>
<p>For this reason alone, it’s likely Tether is going to make a big mark in the industry and inspire a lot of people. Paolo Ardoino – the CTO of Tether – explained in a recent interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>By harnessing the power of bitcoin and Uruguay’s renewable energy capabilities, Tether is leading the way in sustainable and responsible bitcoin mining. Our unwavering commitment to renewable energy ensures that every bitcoin we mine leaves a minimal ecological footprint while upholding the security and integrity of the bitcoin network.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Getting Its Hands on BTC</h2>
<p>It appears Tether is trying to diversify itself a bit by adding more bitcoin units to its growing reserves. Not long ago, the stable asset company purchased more <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/stable-coin-tether-buys-over-200-million-worth-of-btc/">than $200 million worth</a> of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Ardoino was quick to chime in regarding this maneuver as well, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>The decision to invest in bitcoin, the world&#8217;s first and largest cryptocurrency, is underpinned by its strength and potential as an investment asset. Bitcoin has continually proven its resilience and has emerged as a long-term store of value with substantial growth potential. Its limited supply, decentralized nature, and widespread adoption have positioned bitcoin as a favored choice among institutional and retail investors alike.</p></blockquote>
<p>Uruguay presently garners more than 90 percent of its electricity from renewable sources like hydro stations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Australian division of Binance, the world’s largest and most popular digital currency exchange, caused analysts and observers to raise eyebrows in the latter half of May <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/18-bitcoin-discount-emerges-binance-091924045.html">when the</a> firm began selling bitcoin at a huge discount.</p>
<h2>Binance Australia was Practically Giving Away BTC</h2>
<p>During that time, bitcoin was trading between $27,000 and $28,000 on most platforms, though the Australia division of Binance caught everyone off guard when it began selling units for about 20 percent less. Thus, people could go onto the exchange and purchase a unit of bitcoin for just over $23,000.</p>
<p>A Binance spokesperson explained the matter as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>Due to the recent removal of fiat on-ramp services by our payment processor’s banking partner, some Australian users have been withdrawing their AUD holdings from the platform in advance of the off-ramp closure on 1 June.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Australian dollar’s removal from the exchange went into effect on May 18 of this year. From there, it was announced that all remaining units of the fiat currency would be turned into Tether, a popular stable currency. Binance put out the following tweet further clarifying the situation:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fellow Binancians, we regret to inform you that with immediate effect, we are unable to facilitate Pay ID AUD deposits for Binance users due to a decision made by our third-party payment service provider.</p></blockquote>
<p>The spokesperson continued with:</p>
<blockquote><p>As a result, AUD pairs have experienced less liquidity which has impacted their pricing. We will be delisting [the] remaining AUD pairs in line with the closure of fiat off-ramp services. We remain focused on securing additional fiat relationships to service our users.</p></blockquote>
<p>At first glance, the situation appeared hopeful to the untrained eye. It seemed as if the company was just seeking to sell bitcoin at lower costs, thus giving traders something to be grateful for. However, things have certainly come with their fair share of problems.</p>
<p>For example, the platforms allegedly stopped accepting Australian dollar deposits with little notice. Also, several cryptocurrencies that were later exchanged for Australian dollars on the exchange came with heavy premiums, thus raising prices for traders across the board. Lastly, plans have been announced for the delisting of several trading pairs to the displeasure and surprise of investors.</p>
<p>Binance has said this isn’t going to be set in motion permanently, and the company is looking for a separate provider that could potentially reinstate the firm’s abilities to accept and trade in AUD.</p>
<h2>Problems with the CFTC</h2>
<p>At press time, the company is <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/cftc-sues-binance-alleging-financial-violations/">being sued by the</a> Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The agency alleges that Binance repeatedly violated the Commodity Exchange Act. CFTC chair Rostin Behnam claimed in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>For years, Binance knew they were violating CFTC rules, working actively to both keep the money flowing and avoid compliance.</p></blockquote>

<li>Bitcoin cash is eyeing a fresh increase above the $300 resistance against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>The price is now trading near the $275 zone and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $285 on the 4-hour chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair must clear $285 and $300 to start a fresh increase in the near term.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Bitcoin cash price is consolidating gains above $265 against the US Dollar, unlike <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-could-restart-rally-above-this-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a>. BCH/USD could start a fresh surge if it clears the $285 level.</em></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis</h2>
<p>Bitcoin cash price started a downside correction after it failed to clear the $330 zone. BCH formed a high near $329 before there was a bearish move.</p>
<p>The price declined below the $310 and $300 levels. There was a break below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $186 swing low to the $329 high. However, the bulls are protecting more losses below the $250 support zone.</p>
<p>Bitcoin cash is now trading near the $275 zone and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-cash-analysis-fresh-rally-possible-to-330/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $285 level. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $285 on the 4-hour chart of the BCH/USD pair.</p>
<p>The next major resistance is near $300, above which the price may perhaps start a strong increase. The next major resistance is near the $330 level. Any more gains above $330 could set the pace for a move toward the $350 level.</p>
<p>If not, the price might continue to move down. Immediate support on the downside is near the $255 level. The first major support sits near the $240 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $186 swing low to the $329 high. The next major support is near $220, below which the bears might aim for $200.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The state of Texas is looking to be one of the first in the American <a href="https://www.kvue.com/article/news/politics/texas-legislature/texas-cryptocurrency-regulation-hb1666/269-5543d20a-cabf-4e0e-aa9d-11c5f6d20a05">union to regulate cryptocurrency</a>.</p>
<h2>Texas Looks to Create New Crypto Regulation</h2>
<p>Not long ago, House Bill 1666 made its way onto the desk of Greg Abbott, the state’s governor. The bill is a nod to the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/">FTX debacle</a> of last year and will seek to ensure proper and safe trading environments for all residents of Texas that hold or trade digital currencies.</p>
<p>The goal is to make sure everybody’s money steers clear of fraud and other issues known to arise out of the crypto arena. Each year, all virtual currency companies that do business with citizens of Texas will be required to adhere to certain rules like ensuring all customers can withdraw funds whenever they wish.</p>
<p>Also, companies will need to provide proof of reserves to show that if there are ever any problems, executives can stay afloat and provide compensation and recompense to affected traders. Customers will also be able to garner information about the companies’ standing debts and see who they owe money to and how much.</p>
<p>Lastly, the firms in question would not be allowed to commingle funds (in other words, no mixing of company money with customer money), and they would be subjected to annual audits.</p>
<p>State representative Giovanni Capriglione, a republican, commented that he would like Texas to set an example to larger institutions like the federal government, and he hopes the regulation his region sets in place can provide rules and laws for surrounding areas as well. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>You will be comfortable knowing that when you invest online, when you&#8217;re buying cryptos, when you&#8217;re trading it, when you&#8217;re selling, those assets are being watched, that they are being managed, and that there&#8217;s an audit trail that protects those assets.</p></blockquote>
<p>Texas is widely considered a very crypto-friendly state. The region <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/texas-is-still-a-crypto-mining-king/">opened itself to an influx</a> of miners from China after their native country declared that the practice was fully illegal in the summer of 2021. Seeing the opportunities for growth, jobs, innovation, and a rising economy, Texas leaders said, “Come on in” and have built one of the biggest mining arenas of the last ten years.</p>
<h2>Energy Issues Have Popped Up</h2>
<p>However, while this attitude has resulted in a strong economy and powerful job prospects, it has created problems for the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/report-texas-is-suffering-from-too-much-btc-mining/">state’s energy grid</a>. A new report by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) states:</p>
<blockquote><p>Prospective crypto mining businesses have requested to put approximately 33,000 more megawatts in the ERCOT interconnection queue over the next few years (enough to power the whole state of Florida)… A single bitcoin transaction used nearly 1,452 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity, equal to the power consumption of an average U.S. household for nearly 50 days.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As both sides of the political spectrum have waged war on America’s debt ceiling and worked hard to formulate a deal, there’s growing concern that the Treasury is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/05/29/crypto-now-braced-for-a-11-trillion-fed-panic-after-bitcoin-and-ethereum-price-surge/?sh=34ddec114c08">going to issue more</a> than $1 trillion in new bills. Many analysts are worried about this as they say such a move could have atrocious effects on the market.</p>
<h2>The Treasury May Hurt BTC</h2>
<p>Alex Lennard – investment director at global asset manager Ruffer – explained in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our concern is that if liquidity starts leaving the system, for whatever reason, this creates an environment where markets are crash prone.</p></blockquote>
<p>This was seconded by Mike Wilson, an equity strategist at Morgan Stanley. He claimed that while the Treasury is more than likely trying to refill “empty coffers,” the market may lose a heavy amount of liquidity should it move forward with its present plan, and thus a major correction could be heading our way.</p>
<p>There is also concern that the Fed could potentially seek to hike rates further in the coming weeks given inflation has not died down over the past few months the way financial analysts had initially hoped for. Yuga Hasegawa – crypto market analyst at Bit Bank in Tokyo – mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>The debt ceiling issue could soon be a thing of the past, but the future trajectory of the Fed funds rate will continue to weigh on the market sentiment, and bitcoin’s weekend rally could be hindered depending on the series of economic data slated for this week, such as ISM’s manufacturing PMI and May’s jobs report.</p></blockquote>
<p>Still, there is some good news in that economists anticipate a whopping 180,000 jobs to be added to the market in the coming future. However, this doesn’t change the fact that unemployment is expected to move up to close to four percent, and that 180K figure is nothing compared to the 250,000 jobs that were added as recently as April. Hasegawa explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>Economic data in the last month have indicated the resilience of the U.S. economy. Most of all, core indexes for CPI and PCE, as well as trimmed, mean PCE inflation rate for April did not show any significant improvements. The Fed Funds futures market now prices in [a] roughly 65% chance of another rate hike… and if the number keeps going up, it will likely be a headwind for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Could There Be Price Dips?</h2>
<p>The Treasury and its department head Janet Yellen have made it <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/opinion-crypto-fans-may-want-to-wait-on-their-calls-for-regulation/">clear that crypto and other</a> assets are not their main priorities.</p>
<p>Thus, it would be a huge pity if they went ahead with the move anticipated above and it sucked further liquidity out of the market given how far tokens like bitcoin have come this year after enduring some of their most bearish conditions in 2022.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not long ago, Sam Bankman-Fried – the former crypto billionaire behind the now fallen digital exchange FTX – said he was requesting that as <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-wants-10-criminal-charges-tossed-out/">many as ten separate</a> criminal charges he’s facing be thrown out. However, prosecutors <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/sam-bankman-frieds-bid-dismiss-cryptocurrency-charges-meritless-prosec-rcna86772">describe this motion</a> as “meritless,” and say they’re not only going to pursue all charges, but that it’s likely he’ll face penalties for many of them.</p>
<h2>Sam Bankman-Fried Isn&#8217;t Getting off that Easily</h2>
<p>Right now, among the many criminal accusations Bankman-Fried is facing are fraud, conspiracy, foreign bribery, and making illegal campaign contributions. In court documents, prosecutors explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>The indictment sufficiently alleges that the defendant and his co-conspirators made false and misleading representations to lenders relating to Alameda’s financial condition. No more specificity is required.</p></blockquote>
<p>FTX will likely go down as one of the biggest debacles of the digital currency space. The exchange – which first opened its doors for business in 2019 – rose to prominence three years later to become one of the top five digital currency trading platforms in the world. Its founder and chief executive Sam Bankman-Fried was lauded as a genius by many, and his net worth was in the billions towards the end of 2022.</p>
<p>Sadly, this reputation was short-lived as in mid-November, SBF complained of a liquidity crunch on social media. He said he <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-i-the-fall-of-a-token/" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>needed fast cash</strong></a> to keep his business in operation, and he eventually turned to his biggest rival Binance about a possible buyout. While things <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-ii-binance-said-it-would-buy-the-firm/" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>appeared to be moving</strong></a> in that direction for some time, Binance eventually backed <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-iii-the-rise-and-fall-of-sam-bankman-fried/" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>away from the deal</strong></a>, claiming the problems FTX was facing were simply too big for it to handle.</p>
<p>From there, the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/what-will-happen-now-that-ftx-is-bankrupt/" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>company filed bankruptcy</strong></a> and SBF resigned from his post. Things would have been bad enough if they had stopped there, but the trash meter kept rising. It was later discovered that SBF had utilized customer funds to invest in luxury Bahamian real estate and to pay off loans taken out by his other company Alameda Research. He <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-ftxs-disgraced-founder-has-been-arrested/" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>was eventually arrested</strong></a> and extradited back to the United States. He has <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/former-ftx-exec-sam-bankman-fried-pleads-not-guilty-to-fraud/" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>entered a not guilty plea</strong></a> and is awaiting trial at his <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-to-await-trial-at-his-parents-house/" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>parents’ California home</strong></a>.</p>
<h2>Looking for Someone to Blame?</h2>
<p>Sam Bankman-Fried has stated that while the risk management employed by the now bankrupt exchange was less than ideal, he continues to insist that he did not steal customer funds. He also says that the prosecutors in the case are simply looking for someone to blame for what happened and they were quick to rush in and tie him to all the issues that arose.</p>
<p>Many legal experts are saying that the chances of him getting any charges tossed are slim to none as there have been too many customers that lost money. His trial is set to begin in early October.</p>

<li>EOS price started a downside correction below the $0.765 zone against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>The price is now trading below $0.745 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a major bullish trend line forming with support near $0.714 on the 4-hour chart of the EOS/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair could continue to move down if it stays below the $0.745 and $0.768 resistance levels.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>EOS price is declining below $0.768 against the US Dollar, unlike <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-could-restart-rally-above-this-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a>. The price could attempt a fresh increase unless there is a break below $0.70.</em></p>
<h2>EOS Price Analysis</h2>
<p>Earlier this month, EOS price climbed higher above the $0.75 resistance zone against the US Dollar. The price surpassed the $0.80 level and settled above the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</p>
<p>A high was formed near $0.8070 before the price started a downside correction. The price declined below the $0.768 support zone. There was a drop below the 50% Fib retracement level of the key increase from the $0.6410 swing low to the $0.8070 high.</p>
<p>However, the bulls were active near the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/eos-price-analysis-bulls-protecting-key-support-at-0-70/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$0.70 support</a>. The price is also stable above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the key increase from the $0.6410 swing low to the $0.8070 high.</p>
<p>More importantly, there is a major bullish trend line forming with support near $0.714 on the 4-hour chart of the EOS/USD pair. The pair is now trading below $0.768 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</p>
<p>On the downside, immediate support is near the $0.714 level and the trend line. The next key support is near the $0.70 level. If there is a downside break below the $0.70 support, the price could revisit the $0.64 support. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $0.745 level. The first major resistance is near the $0.768 level, above which the price could rise steadily toward the $0.80 level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.848 level.</p>

<li>Litecoin is consolidating losses near the $96 level against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>LTC price is now trading below $98 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $97.00 on the 4-hour chart of the LTC/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $97 and $98 resistance levels.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Litecoin price is showing positive signs above $92 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-could-restart-rally-above-this-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a>. LTC price could climb again if there is a clear move above $98.</em></p>
<h2>Litecoin Price Analysis</h2>
<p>In the past few sessions, there were mostly range moves in Bitcoin, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-eth-aims-fresh-run-to-2000/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a>, Ripple, and Litecoin against the US Dollar. Earlier, LTC started a downside correction from the $115 resistance.</p>
<p>The price traded below the $105 and $100 levels. However, the bulls were active near the $92 zone. The price is now consolidating losses and trading above $95. It even spiked a few times above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $114.98 swing high to the $91.88 low.</p>
<p>However, the bears were active near the $98 resistance zone. It is now consolidating below $98 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours). On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $97 level.</p>
<p>There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $97.00 on the 4-hour chart of the LTC/USD pair. A clear move above the $98 level could push the price toward the $104 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $114.98 swing high to the $91.88 low.</p>
<p>The next major resistance sits near the $110 level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $115 level. On the downside, initial support is near the $94 level.</p>
<p>The next major support is near the $92 level. If there is a downside break below the $92 support, the price could accelerate lower toward the $82 level in the near term.</p>
