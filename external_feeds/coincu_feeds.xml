<p><strong>Haruna</strong> <strong>Mustafa</strong>, director of banking supervision, announced the modifications and noted:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“Customers should be encouraged to use alternative channels (Internet banking, mobile banking apps, USSD, cards/POS, eNaira, etc.) to conduct their banking transactions.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a December 6 circular, the <strong>Central Bank of Nigeria</strong> <a href="https://www.cbn.gov.ng/Out/2022/CCD/RevisedCashWithdrawal.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that individuals and businesses would now be restricted to withdrawing no more than <strong>$45 (20,000 nairas)</strong> <strong>daily</strong> and <strong>$225 (100,000 nairas)</strong> <strong>every week </strong>from ATMs.</p>



<p>Before the announcement, the daily cash withdrawal caps for individuals were <strong>$338 (150,000 nairas)</strong>, and for enterprises, they were <strong>$1,128 (500,000 nairas)</strong>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Additionally, there will be a weekly withdrawal cap for both people and businesses of <strong>$225 (100,000 nairas)</strong> and <strong>$1,125 (500,000 nairas)</strong>, respectively. Any monies taken out more than those restrictions would incur a <strong>5% fee</strong> for individuals and a <strong>10% cost for businesses</strong>.</p>



<p>The daily cap for cash withdrawals from point-of-sale terminals is also <strong>$45 (20,000 nairas)</strong>.</p>



<p>The limits are cumulative for each withdrawal, so someone who withdraws <strong>$45 </strong>from an ATM on the same day and then tries to withdraw money from a bank will be charged a <strong>5% service fee</strong>.</p>



<p>Since its inception on <strong>October 25, 2021</strong>, adoption rates for the <a href="https://news.coincu.com/137998-nigeria-switches-new-banknotes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eNaira</a> &#8211; Nigeria&#8217;s <strong>central bank digital currency (CBDC)</strong> &#8211; have remained poor. The <strong>Central Bank of Nigeria</strong> has <a href="https://news.coincu.com/136916-0-5-nigeria-population-is-leveraging-enaira/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">failed</a> to persuade its citizens to utilize the <strong>CBDC</strong>, with <strong>fewer than 0.5%</strong> <strong>of the population using the eNaira as of October 25</strong>, a year after its introduction.</p>

<p>On <strong>October 26</strong>, Nigeria&#8217;s central bank Governor, <strong>Godwin Emefiele</strong>, stated that <strong>85% of all Naira in circulation was stored outside of banks</strong> and that, as a result, the central bank will be reissuing fresh banknotes to accelerate the transition toward digital payments.</p>



<p><a href="https://news.coincu.com/27191-nigerias-president-announces-central-bank-digital-currency-enaira/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nigeria</a> implemented its <strong>&#8220;cash-less&#8221;</strong> policy in <strong>2012</strong>, implying that moving away from physical currency would increase the efficiency of its payment system, lower the cost of banking services, and improve the efficacy of its monetary policy.</p>

<p>On the Bitcoin and altcoin market caps, Dimon referred to the former’s monetary value as representative of the whole industry.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“So Bitcoin is worth under a trillion dollars today, and we’re not sure that’s a real market, by the way.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>To further support his stance on the matter, Dimon turned to the purported prevalence of illicit activity within the industry, including cybercrime, exchange tokens, and tax avoidance.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“There’s 20 to 30 billion of ransomware that we know about, 20 to 30 billion of exchange coins that we know about, lots of AML, terrorist financing, tax avoidance, sex trafficking, why do we allow this stuff to take place?”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With that, he called on regulators to focus their attention on the crypto industry, and not on the banks.</p>

<p>In 2017, Dimon appeared to soften his stance toward crypto by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/protocol-fintech/bitcoin-crypto-jamie-dimon-jpmorgan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acknowledging</a>&nbsp;that many of JPMorgan’s clients have an investment interest in the sector.</p>

<p>“They disagree [with me]. That’s what makes markets. So, if they want to have access to buy yourself bitcoin, we can’t custody it but we can give them legitimate, as clean as possible, access.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>JPMorgan announced its support for the cryptocurrency sector in November by concluding its first international transaction on Polygon.</p>



<p>The transfer was a part of a pilot project run by the <strong>Monetary Authority of Singapore to examine possible DeFi use cases in the wholesale finance markets, which also included DBS Bank and SBI Digital Asset Holdings.</strong></p>



<p>It was widely accepted that the action represented traditional finance embracing the notion of employing decentralized finance as a tool to modernize global monetary exchange.</p>



<p>But looking back to Dimon&#8217;s most recent CNBC remarks, it appears that the pilot program was approved with clenched teeth rather than by a strong conviction in the virtues of cryptocurrency.</p>

<p><strong>Sprecher</strong>, whose ICE runs the New York Stock Exchange, asserted confidently on <strong>December 6</strong> at the financial services conference by <strong>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </strong>that <strong>crypto assets are going to be regulated and transacted like securities.</strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“What does that mean? It means more transparency, it means segregated client funds, the role of the broker as a broker-dealer will be overseeing and the exchanges will be separated from the brokers. The settlement and clearing will be separated from the exchanges.”</p>

<p>In light of <a href="https://news.coincu.com/149476-ftx-gets-afsl-through-legal-loopholes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX</a>&#8216;s recent collapse, which wiped out uncountable billions from the market, left customer funds in limbo, and damaged crypto&#8217;s reputation among regulators and officials, there is a renewed focus on regulating cryptocurrencies as securities.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-515.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-515-1024x683.png" alt="CEO Of ICE: Crypto Assets Are Going To Be Regulated And Dealt Like Securities" class="wp-image-149886" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-515-1024x683.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-515-300x200.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-515-768x512.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-515-750x500.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-515.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="CEO Of ICE: Crypto Assets Are Going To Be Regulated And Dealt Like Securities 12"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">    </figcaption></figure></div>


<p><strong>Sprecher</strong> asserted that the legal frameworks for securities already exist and will just be implemented more strongly, so new regulation is not necessarily necessary for cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>As Coincu <a href="https://news.coincu.com/149753-elizabeth-warren-to-give-sec-more-power/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, Senator <strong>Elizabeth Warren</strong>, a vocal opponent of cryptocurrencies, is also working on a bill that would give the <strong>Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</strong>, headed by <a href="https://news.coincu.com/139096-gary-gensler-cited-enforcement-actions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gary Gensler</a>, the majority of the regulatory power over the industry.</p>

<p><strong>Adam</strong> <strong>Back</strong>, the CEO of Blockstream and a cryptographer, would not disclose the specifics of the most recent investment round, but he did say that the money will be used to increase the company&#8217;s mining capacity.</p>

<p>“We rapidly sold out all of the capacity and have a big backlog of existing and new customers with miners seeking large-scale hosting with us,” he said.</p>

<p>Founded in <strong>2014</strong>, the firm has raised <strong>$299 million</strong> in total as of this writing, according to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/blockstream/company_financials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crunchbase</a> data. It offers infrastructure support to the cryptocurrency sector and most recently collaborated with fintech company Block to open a mining operation that is powered by solar and batteries. </p>



<p>Over the years, it has also acquired a number of companies, including <strong>SponDoolies-Tech</strong> and <strong>Adamant</strong> <strong>Capital</strong>.</p>



<p>To create a solar-powered <strong>Bitcoin</strong> mining facility, the company is collaborating with Jack Dorsey&#8217;s <a href="https://news.coincu.com/136088-block-is-expanding-human-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Block</a> (previously <strong>Square</strong>).</p>



<p>Following the failure of crypto exchange <strong>FTX</strong>, Blockstream is not the only crypto company that has had to lower its ambitions as market circumstances worsen. According to sources, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/149592-business-as-usual-at-amber-group/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amber Group</a> is also raising money and is doing so at values that are either unchanged from earlier rounds or lower.</p>

<p>A committee inquiry found that <strong>Cawthorn</strong> <a href="https://ethics.house.gov/sites/ethics.house.gov/files/documents/Committee%20Report_50.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">violated</a> federal law and House ethics standards by failing to disclose his ownership of the token known as <strong>&#8220;LGB Coin&#8221; </strong>before he lost the Republican primary for his seat. After a probe was launched, <strong>Cawthorn</strong> filed the necessary disclosures for his holdings but did not advertise the purchase of the token publicly. He had bought the coins for <strong>$150,000.</strong></p>



<p>The phrase <strong>&#8220;Let&#8217;s Go Brandon&#8221;</strong>—a joking rallying cry for President Joe Biden&#8217;s detractors—is referenced in the token&#8217;s name.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-508.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="768" height="1024" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-508-768x1024.png" alt="Rep.

<p><strong>180 billion LGB Coin</strong>, with an average market worth of about <strong>$164,200 at the time</strong>, resulted from the <strong>$150,000</strong> Cawthorn paid to an anonymous person engaged with the token. Additionally, <strong>Cawthorn</strong> <strong>did not pay transaction costs</strong>.</p>



<p>Cawthorn bought the tokens on <strong>December 21, 2021</strong>, and sold<strong> &#8220;almost all&#8221;</strong> of them in three batches, making a total loss of close to <strong>$7,500</strong> by the end of <strong>January</strong> <strong>2022</strong>.</p>



<p>Even though he broke gift laws by accepting a discount on the previously unreported purchase, the <strong>North Carolina Republican</strong> looks to have lost nearly all of his investment in addition to the <strong>&#8220;admonishment&#8221;</strong> from the <strong>House Ethics Committee</strong>. </p>



<p>Although the committee report on the probe says the value of his remaining<strong> LGB Coin</strong> was much less at the time the Report was adopted, and it is unclear how <strong>Representative</strong> <strong>Cawthorn</strong> obtained his estimation of the value, <strong>Cawthorn valued his current token holdings at $357.52.</strong> He reported possessing <strong>15,378,707,329 LGB Coin</strong> as of <strong>November</strong> <strong>19</strong>.</p>

<p>The committee mandated <strong>Cawthorn</strong> to make a charitable donation of about <strong>$14,237.49</strong> in addition to paying a <strong>$1,000</strong> late disclosure fine to the <a href="https://news.coincu.com/125483-us-doj-suppress-crypto-crimes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Justice</a>.</p>



<p>The committee claimed to have investigated possible fraud and insider trading around the matter but had not discovered enough proof. The Ethics panel, however, stated that the soon-to-be-former congressman <strong>who behaved in a manner that did not reflect creditably upon the House i</strong>n breach of House behavior standards should receive an admonition due to its investigation.</p>



<p>After serving one year in the <strong>11th Congressional District of North Carolina</strong>, the Representative will step down in <strong>January 2023</strong> after losing to North Carolina Senator <strong>Chuck Edwards </strong>in the Republican party primary in <strong>May</strong>.</p>

<p>The collateralization ratio takes into account in-scope assets that are backed by out-of-scope assets and are loans through the margin and loans service offering.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;At the time of assessment, Mazars observed Binance controlled in-scope assets in excess of 100% of their total platform liabilities,&#8221; it <a href="https://veritas.mazars.com/binance/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://veritas.mazars.com/binance/" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated. </a></p>

<p></p>



<p>According to a press release from the company, the new service, Interchange, will allow customers to maintain assets through Zodia Custody and then replicate those holdings on an exchange. This service will be used by Zodia Markets, a sibling company of Zodia.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“Zodia Custody’s key principles have always evolved around asset safety, segregation between custody and trading, and the effective management of counterparty risk,&#8221; said Maxime de Guillebon in the release. </p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;The difficulties crypto investors have endured over the last year have exacerbated how critical these principles are today. At Zodia Custody, we believe that such a solution, like Interchange, is not optional, but mandatory.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Zodia Custody is a subsidiary of UK investment bank Standard Chartered and backed by Northern Trust.</p>



<p>In order to start working on Zodia in December 2020, Northern Trust teamed with SC Ventures, the innovation and ventures division of Standard Chartered. According to its website, Chicago-based Northern Trust had $12.8 trillion in assets under custody as of September 2022.</p>

<p></p>



<p>As a result, users can profit passively from their metaverse assets.</p>



<p>Decentraland defines LAND owners as accounts or wallet addresses that possess &#8220;a Parcel, an Estate, or both&#8221; of the smart contract for LAND.</p>



<p>All LAND leases are made in MANA, <strong>Decentraland&#8217;s native token</strong>, and are paid in full beforehand. The site provided examples of DJs renting space for a club or party or virtual institutions renting land to create campuses.</p>



<p>Similar to the majority of rental agreements for real estate, Decentraland landlords are unable to sell their properties or accept any offers to buy them until the term of the agreement has expired.</p>



<p>On Twitter, <strong>Decentraland&#8217;s fans recommended that wearables should be eligible for the same rental program.</strong> The reception from the locals was generally positive.</p>



<p>This occurs at a time when the metaverse is developing and gaining increasing interest from both inside and outside of the Web3 sector.</p>



<p>The Oxford Dictionary considered the term<strong> &#8220;metaverse&#8221;</strong> as its word of the year, but it ultimately placed second.</p>



<p>In order to improve the digital experiences of its consumers and strengthen its metaverse capabilities, internet stalwart Mozilla recently bought Active Replica. While Animoca, a developer of the metaverse and GameFi, acknowledged speculations that it would establish a $1 billion metaverse fund for companies looking to expand virtual reality,</p>



<p>For new community members and developers, the metaverse, especially mega-events like festivals and fashion week, continues to be a portal into the larger Web3 world.</p>

<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color"> Japanese regulatory landscape couldn&#8217;t discover anything new </h2>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Japan-Advises-Against-Stablecoins-Algorithmic-Backing.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Japan-Advises-Against-Stablecoins-Algorithmic-Backing.jpg" alt="Japan Advises Against Stablecoins Algorithmic Backing" class="wp-image-149851" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Japan-Advises-Against-Stablecoins-Algorithmic-Backing.jpg 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Japan-Advises-Against-Stablecoins-Algorithmic-Backing-300x169.jpg 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Japan-Advises-Against-Stablecoins-Algorithmic-Backing-768x432.jpg 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Japan-Advises-Against-Stablecoins-Algorithmic-Backing-750x422.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Japan Advises Against Stablecoins Algorithmic Backing 34"></a></figure></div>


<p></p>



<p>The Banking Act, the Payment Services Act, and the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, three important pieces of legislation, together make up the 29-page presentation that systemsatizes the Japanese approach to cryptocurrency regulation. The emphasis on distinguishing between &#8220;crypto assets&#8221; and &#8220;digital-money type stablecoins&#8221; gives a novel viewpoint on the local regulators&#8217; approach to the latter, but one familiar with the Japanese regulatory landscape couldn&#8217;t discover anything new at this time.</p>



<p>Additionally, Amaya&#8217;s speech makes no mention of any specific deadlines or general themes for upcoming legislation. The Vice Minister does, however, refer to the FSA suggestions, which were allegedly made in October, in the <strong>&#8220;Way Forward&#8221; </strong>section towards the end of the document. The quote reads:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“The proposed review states that ‘global stablecoins must not use algorithms in stabilizing their value’ and strengthens the ensuring of redemption rights.”&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Given that algorithmic<strong> stablecoins are not covered by the existing stablecoins policy</strong>, which was approved by Parliament in June and will go into effect in June 2023, MPs will likely take this suggestion into account in the future. The cryptocurrency markets experienced a sharp decrease following the collapse of the Terra tokens, which led to the algorithmic stablecoin<strong> Terra USD (UST) losing its 1:1 value to the US dollar in early May.</strong> This contributed to the passage of the bill itself.<br></p>
