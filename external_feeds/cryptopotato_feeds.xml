			            <description><![CDATA[The crypto scammer purportedly drained more than $2 million from Hayne and five other prisoners at Cooma Correctional Centre.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Jarryd Hayne &#8211; a former NRL superstar &#8211; has supposedly parted with $780,000 after falling prey in a Bitcoin scam. The athlete, who was slammed with a prison sentence for allegedly raping a woman, was tricked by a fellow inmate.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The scammer is currently in jail after being accused of swindling $4.6 million from family and friends in a Ponzi scheme.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Conned Even Behind Bars</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/nrl/article-12228675/Fallen-NRL-star-Jarryd-Hayne-allegedly-loses-780K-duped-inmate-Bitcoin-scam.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reported</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> by Daily Mail, the person in charge of the Bitcoin fraud was Ishan Seenar Sappideen, who met Hayne in the prison of Cooma, Australia. The former promised a significant return on investment related to the primary cryptocurrency to the ex-rugby player and other inmates. To present himself as an expert in the field, he claimed he had previously earnt nearly $300 million for clients.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Six fellow prisoners, including Hayne, bit the hook and transferred over $2 million between 2020 and 2022. The funds were sent by people outside the jail into accounts controlled by Sappideen due to the lack of online access in the facility.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite having a settlement that protects his six-figure investment, the whereabouts of Hayne&#8217;s funds remain </span>unknown.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Australian law enforcement agents organized the transfer of Sappideen to another correctional facility following the information about his alleged fraud.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Earlier this year, CSNSW intelligence officers became aware of allegations an inmate at Cooma Correctional Centre was attempting to coerce and advise fellow inmates to make transactions on the financial markets. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The accused inmate … has since had his security classification reviewed to enable a higher level of supervision and less freedom. CSNSW refers suspected criminal activity to the Police Corrections Intelligence Unit who shares intelligence with relevant state and federal police,&#8221; a spokeswoman added.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Hayne, who became a world rugby champion with Australia in 2013, was charged with aggravated sexual assault over a woman in Newcastle in 2019. He was recently found guilty of two counts of sexual intercourse without consent and sentenced to spend at least three years in prison.<br />

			            <description><![CDATA[Anonymous callers placing fake bomb threats are trying to extort thousands of dollars in Bitcoin from employees of various retailers.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A slew of major U.S. grocery chains have been targeted by scammers in recent months posing fake bomb threats with demands for ransom payments.</p>
<p>While often involving cash or gift cards, the scammers have sometimes requested that their victims pay them in Bitcoin (BTC).</p>
<h2>The Supermarket Scam</h2>
<p>As <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/scammers-target-stores-with-bomb-threats-seeking-bitcoin-and-gift-cards-49a2e87c?page=1" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">reported</a> by the Wall Street Journal on Sunday, companies like Kroger, Walmart, Whole Foods Market have been targeted by the scam at various stores across and Wisconsin, with scammers threatening to detonate bombs if payments weren’t made. Law enforcement is already investigating the issue.</p>
<p>In a suburb north of Chicago, a Whole Foods employee received a call claiming that a pipe bomb had been placed in the building and said he would detonate it unless paid with $5,000 in BTC. A Kroger employee in Mexico received a similar threat demanding a wire payment, claiming a bomb would explode if the employee tried calling the police.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, employees did contact authorities, and police helped evacuate each store. No suspicious items were found in either situation.</p>
<p>According to industry experts, bomb threats demanding ransom from retailers are a newer form of extortion that began earlier this year.</p>
<p>“Every single day, we worry about safety and take everything extremely serious,” said Rodney McMullen, chief executive of Kroger. The retailer is already cooperating with local law enforcement and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The FBI said that members of the public should stay aware of their surroundings and report suspicious activity to law enforcement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, local police in the relevant areas are trying to investigate the threat, but are having trouble tracking the scammer down because the callers used hacked phone numbers. Authorities say it&#8217;s still unclear where callers are located, or whether they’re operating as part of an organized effort.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin and Ransom</h2>
<p>Bitcoin has become a popular tool for facilitating ransom payments thanks to its global nature, relative privacy, and immunity to transaction reversals. In May, a Russian man named Mikhail Pavlovich Matveev was <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/russian-man-charged-for-200-million-in-ransomware-crimes-involving-crypto/" data-wpel-link="internal">charged</a> for working with co-conspirators to extort $200 million in payments across multiple ransomware strains, much of which came through crypto.</p>
<p>In 2022, Ransomware payments in crypto <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ransomware-revenue-drops-amidst-less-successful-extortion-attempts-chainalysis/" data-wpel-link="internal">fell substantially</a> compared to 2021 as victims became less willing to make the transfers. U.S. Treasury sanctions rules against making such payments have made them riskier for victims to conduct.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[Press Release &#8211; Geneva, Switzerland, June 26th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p>TRON DAO is pleased to announce that Arkham, the leading blockchain intelligence platform, has launched support for the TRON blockchain.</p>
<p>Arkham deanonymize blockchains by showing users the people and companies behind cryptocurrency transactions. Arkham’s support for the TRON blockchain will enable traders and researchers to track the entities on TRON using Arkham’s AI-powered analytics engine.</p>
<p>TRON is the world’s leading blockchain by number of daily active addresses. It averages over 2 million daily this month, which surpasses both Ethereum and Bitcoin. It is the 2nd largest blockchain by total value locked. The TRON-Arkham partnership thus represents a major step forward in Arkham’s coverage of global blockchain activity.</p>
<blockquote><p>“This partnership aligns perfectly with our values, offering our millions of users the ability to dive deeper into the blockchain than ever before,” says a spokesperson of TRON DAO. “Arkham&#8217;s cutting-edge analytics engine will bring a new level of understanding to the TRON blockchain, allowing traders and researchers to map out the entities within our network. Together with Arkham, we aim to revolutionize the way people view and interact with the blockchain.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Miguel Morel, Founder and CEO of Arkham, also added, “We’re delighted to have TRON as a partner, as we launch support for their blockchain on Arkham. They’ve achieved a significance which few other blockchains have, particularly in the Asian market, where Arkham is deeply committed to growing our presence.”</p>
<p><strong>About TRON DAO</strong></p>
<p>TRON DAO is a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps.</p>
<p>Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of June 2023, it has over 168.8 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 5.97 billion total transactions, and over $12.49 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN.</p>
<p>In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government’s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (“DMC”), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica’s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens &#8211; TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.</p>

<p><strong>About Arkham</strong></p>
<p>Arkham is deanonymizing the blockchain. With backing from the founders of Palantir and OpenAI, Arkham is building a crypto intelligence platform that shows users the people and companies behind blockchain activity and addresses, along with advanced data and analytics about their behavior. To deanonymize blockchain users and match them to identities, Arkham uses Ultra, a proprietary AI-powered address-matching engine.

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[Press Release &#8211; Los Angeles, USA, June 26th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p>Deso is thrilled to announce they have joined forces with the leading Sui Wallet, Ethos, to integrate <a href="https://heroswap.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">HeroSwap</a>, the instant anonymous cross-chain swapping service for crypto. This collaboration elevates the user experience on Sui by providing developers, traders, and creators with an easy and efficient way to onboard into the Sui blockchain while driving more liquidity into the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Now, Sui users can swap assets between Bitcoin, Ethereum, DeSo, Solana, and more while using <a href="https://ethoswallet.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Ethos</a>. This is a pivotal moment in crypto, paving the way for seamless crypto swapping across all major blockchains while allowing users to remain anonymous and maintain full self-custody of their coins.</p>
<p>Recently, Ethos secured seed funding of $4.2 million, with contributions from notable VC firms like Boldstart Ventures and gumi Cryptos Capital (gCC) and participation from Mysten Labs. Ethos was founded with a vision to transform the crypto wallet-to-wallet experience by co-founders Nadia Eldeib (CEO) and Jared Cosulich (CTO). Ethos aims to deliver a user-friendly and secure wallet for storing crypto and discovering new apps, games, and NFTs in the SUI ecosystem.</p>
<p>Despite the immense potential of layer-1 blockchains, liquidity fragmentation and isolation have posed significant challenges for developers and everyday users, restricting cross-chain marketplace exposure and liquidity onboarding. Ethos co-founder Nadia Eldeib recognizes blockchain&#8217;s potential to transform billions of lives, stressing the need for a seamless UX for developers and consumers across different platforms.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The current web3 wallet experience is designed to store digital assets, but it has the potential to become so much more! At Ethos, our goal is to create a web3 gateway for SUI, and the greater blockchain ecosystem, that allows everyday users to interact cross-chain while discovering new apps, games, and NFTs in the SUI ecosystem.” – Ethos co-founder Nadia Eldeib.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is where HeroSwap comes into play. <a href="https://heroswap.com/embed" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Embedding HeroSwap</a>, powered by DeSo’s Smart Services, the Ethos Wallet allows for nearly instant and anonymous cross-chain swaps while maintaining custody of your coins. This mitigates the risk of unforeseen CEX blowups where users&#8217; assets are locked up or outright lost, as we’ve seen with FTX and countless others.</p>
<p><div class="embed"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GdMw-0EDd8g?showinfo=0"></iframe></div></p>
<p>With HeroSwap, cross-chain ecosystems like Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin, and DeSo become instantly accessible for Sui users. They can now explore different layer-1 blockchains with ease while using Ethos as a central web3 hub that securely maintains all their crypto assets.</p>
<p>If Sui users want to avoid volatility, they can instantly swap into USDC or USDT using HeroSwap. Additionally, HeroSwap has frictionless zero login, so users never have to share sensitive personal information with centralized intermediaries.</p>
<p>DeSo Founder, Nader Al-Naji, is confident that HeroSwap holds the key to consumer-facing crypto applications that reach billions of users, redefining interoperability and composability:</p>
<blockquote><p>“HeroSwap unlocks the potential for consumer-facing crypto apps to reach billions of users. It&#8217;s redefining interoperability and composability for all crypto applications, and it can be integrated with any web3 app with just a single line of code. The added bonus is that all swaps are nearly instant and anonymous, allowing developers and users to mitigate the risk of losing their assets to centralized exchange meltdowns while maintaining custody of their coins.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The integration of HeroSwap into the Ethos wallet is the second DeSo partnership in the <a href="https://sui.hyperspace.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Sui ecosystem</a>. Teams that incorporate HeroSwap into their crypto apps not only improve user experience through ease of onboarding but also stand to earn a percentage of every swap from the permissionless revenue-sharing program. The integration process is simple, easy, and only takes a few minutes of time.</p>
<p>Those interested in earning recurring affiliate revenue can go <a href="https://heroswap.com/referrals" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">here</a>, and potential partners who want to execute a co-marketing campaign can contact DeSo directly.</p>
<p>The HeroSwap-Ethos partnership exemplifies DeSo&#8217;s commitment to creating an interoperable blockchain future by making it easy for ambitious founders to create viral consumer-friendly crypto applications that reach billions of users.</p>
<p><strong>About Deso</strong></p>
<p>Raising $200 million from leading investors such as Sequoia, Andreessen Horowitz, Coinbase Ventures, and more, <a href="https://www.deso.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">DeSo</a> is a pioneering layer-1 blockchain whose mission is to decentralize social media, much like Bitcoin and Ethereum have decentralized finance.</p>
<p>Recently, DeSo has unveiled an array of groundbreaking innovations. Among these is Revolution, their breakthrough Proof-of-Stake mechanism, set to boost energy efficiency by 99% and position DeSo as one of the most deflationary layer-1s in all of crypto.</p>
<p>Additionally, Deso released four new app proposals, including <a href="https://proposals.deso.com/docs/openfund" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Openfund 2.0</a>, a DEX that works as seamlessly as centralized exchanges like Binance, enabling nearly instantaneous and anonymous trades while allowing users to maintain custody of their coins.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s been a rumor circling cryptocurrency-oriented social media circles throughout the past couple of days, that Ripple is planning to buy back 10 billion XRP tokens, currently worth just shy of $5 billion.</p>

<li>David Schwartz, who is the CTO of Ripple, dismissed them yesterday.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[Gemini has added support for crypto withdrawals for customers of Voyager Digital.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a major relief for the customers impacted by the Voyager bankruptcy, crypto exchange Gemini has announced the enabling of withdrawals. The crypto transfer window will end on July 23, 2023.</p>
<p>In a recent blog post<a href="https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-welcomes-voyager-customers-to-our-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">,</a> Gemini confirmed allowing withdrawals for victims of the Voyager bankruptcy case while simultaneously offering a promotional welcome to all Voyager customers who join the crypto exchange.</p>
<p>The exchange plans to offer $5 in BTC to new US customers from the bankrupt crypto lender after they sign up and become verified within 30 days of opening their account.</p>
<h2>Claiming Voyager funds through Gemini</h2>
<p>Voyager customers can create an account on Gemini to receive their cryptocurrencies. Customers holding tokens that are not supported by Gemini cannot be sent to the exchange, it said in a <a href="https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-welcomes-voyager-customers-to-our-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">statement</a>. Gemini urged them to carefully confirm sending only supported tokens to the platform, as any unsupported tokens sent to the Gemini account may be lost and completely unrecoverable.</p>
<p>Similarly, sending tokens to Gemini over an unsupported network will also result in a complete loss of funds. Furthermore, if users fail to withdraw their tokens from the Voyager platform during the stipulated withdrawal period, the funds will be liquidated and distributed in cash to them.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Through July 23, 2023, Voyager customers impacted by the Voyager bankruptcy can create a Gemini account to withdraw their crypto in-kind, pursuant to the claims distribution process.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The development comes a few weeks after the bankrupt crypto broker was <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/voyager-to-enable-customer-withdrawals-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">reported</a> to be gearing up to reopen its app to enable the withdrawal of customer funds. The approved bankruptcy plan states that Voyager customers will initially receive 35.72% of what they are owed.</p>
<h3>Regulatory Hurdles</h3>
<p>Voyager had previously failed to negotiate two deals after sliding to bankruptcy nearly a year ago. The first of these was with FTX US, but the $1.4 billion deal fell through after FTX itself filed for bankruptcy. Subsequently, a $1 billion deal with the US arm of crypto giant Binance fell through after the latter backed out, citing a &#8220;hostile and uncertain regulatory climate&#8221; in the country.</p>
<p>Gemini, too, faced significant challenges on the regulatory front, which forced it to expand its operations abroad.</p>
<p>Last week, the Winklevoss twins-led platform <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/crypto-exchange-gemini-launches-eth-staking-pro-in-the-uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">launched</a> its in-house Ethereum staking program in the United Kingdom to enable institutions and high-net-worth individuals to run validators on the Ethereum blockchain. Gemini is also planning to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/gemini-to-increase-headcount-above-100-in-singapore-amid-hostile-us-regulatory-climate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">increase</a> its Singapore offices to over 100 employees.</p>
<p>It also <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/gemini-eyes-uae-expansion-amid-us-uncertainty-crypto-com-gets-mpi-license-in-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">started</a> the process of securing a crypto license to serve customers based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) amidst regulatory headwinds back home.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Integrating Redefine's DeFirewall into Safe is expected to improve transaction security for users. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Self-custody infrastructure provider Safe (formerly known as Gnosis) has announced a strategic partnership with blockchain security firm Redefine.</p>
<p>The main aim is to enable users to transact with &#8220;more confidence&#8221; by diligently checking each transaction which can be achieved by integrating Redefine&#8217;s pre-transaction risk assessment tool DeFirewall into Safe&#8217;s user interface.</p>
<h2>Enhancing Blockchain Security</h2>
<p>According to the official press release shared with <em>CryptoPotato</em>, the integration of Redefine&#8217;s DeFirewall into Safe is expected to elevate the level of protection over assets while simultaneously guaranteeing greater transaction security. The latest move will ultimately foster greater adoption of digital assets, Redefine said in a statement.</p>
<p>Richard Meissner, Co-Founder and Technical Lead at Safe, underscored the importance of improving the user interfaces of Web3 platforms in a bid to combat bad actors and exploits in this digital asset industry. He also highlighted the issue of blind signing, where users may sign off on transactions they are not fully informed about. This is an area of concern in the process of making self-custody accessible to a broader range of users as well as organizations, the exec added.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;By partnering with Redefine and integrating DeFirewall, Safe is offering greater transparency and assurance in their everyday transactions, enabling sustainable growth on the platform.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Redefine&#8217;s CEO and co-founder Shira Brezis said that the integration combines two crucial elements for the user &#8211; enhanced risk visibility and trusted security. She further stated that the partnership will usher in a new era of security with this collaboration between the two platforms.</p>
<h2>Gnosis Safe&#8217;s Expansion and Rebranding</h2>
<p>Safe is originally a product in the Gnosis ecosystem. The digital asset management platform rebranded to Safe in July 2022 after <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/gnosis.eth/proposal/0x5187694133abfb3d140acce3b9ac2ecf033c657c816a18dc25d2e0c1a2a29ec7" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">spinning off</a> from its parent company and raised $100 million in funding, in a round led by crypto fund 1kx. Other participants included prominent names such as Tiger Global, A&amp;T Capital, Blockchain Capital, ConsenSys, and Polygon among others.</p>
<p>The Safe community members later voted to launch the SafeDAO and the SAFE token.</p>
<p>Safe and other self-custodial solutions had previously <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/metamask-institutional-announces-strategic-partnerships-with-gnosis-safe-hex-trust-gk8-and-parfin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">partnered</a> with MetaMask to expand the latter&#8217;s organizational reach and streamline the DAO experience. More recently, the firm tapped payments giant, Stripe to roll out a new software development kit for Web3 developers, allowing them to build Web3 apps with the help of account abstraction.</p>
