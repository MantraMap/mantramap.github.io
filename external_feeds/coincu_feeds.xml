<p>At a meeting with twenty investigators on November 22, <strong>Friedberg supplied information about FTX</strong>, the source claimed. According to the source, officials from the Justice Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the US Securities and Exchange Commission were present at the meeting, which was conducted at the US Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Southern District of New York. Reuters looked at the emails exchanged by these participants to schedule the meeting with agencies.</p>



<p>The source claimed that he shared his knowledge with the prosecution at the meeting on Bankman-usage Fried&#8217;s of client funds to support his vast business empire. According to the source, <strong>Friedberg gave facts about the operation of Bankman-hedge Fried&#8217;s fund Alameda Research and related talks he had with other senior officials.</strong></p>



<p>There currently needs to be more information about Friedberg&#8217;s involvement. The source claims that neither he nor anybody else has been informed that he is the subject of a criminal inquiry. The source said that <strong>he anticipates being called as a government witness in the Bankman-Fried trial in October.</strong></p>

<p>Last week, the well-known trader stated that <strong>Ethereum (ETH) competitor Solana (SOL) was nearing a low.</strong></p>



<p class="has-small-font-size">Looks like the market might actually be a bit crowded here. I think that my own interpretation of calling for another 50% drop along with everyone else calling for $3 might be the signal that this thing is completely one-sided and potentially bottoming here for the near future.</p>



<p>The cryptocurrency trader called Solana correctly thus far. SOL is currently trading at <strong>$13.17</strong>, up more than <strong>60%</strong> from its low of $8.0.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Taleb argues that Bitcoin has failed to achieve its purpose of being a decentralized currency and store of value.</em></li>



<li><em>Bitcoin is vulnerable to inflation and cannot protect against black swan events.</em></li>

<h5><strong>In a recent interview with L&#8217;Express, famed author of Black Swan Nassim Nicholas Taleb discussed his views on Bitcoin and called it the detector of imbeciles.</strong></h5>

<p>The excitement around cryptocurrencies can be related to nearly low-interest rates, which are limiting the options available to investors seeking risk-free investments. <strong>As a result, this was encouraging speculation rather than real finance.</strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">Lowering rates creates asset bubbles without necessarily helping the economy. Capital no longer costs anything, risk-free returns on investment become too low, even negative, pushing people into speculation. We lose our sense of what a long-term investment is. It is the end of real finance.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Additionally, he mentioned what may be <strong>characterized as a pervasive Ponzi-like attitude</strong> that was gaining ground in the computer industry, alluding to businesses with no cash flow and no underlying financial soundness.</p>

<p class="has-small-font-size">Investors get pushed into a Ponzi-like strategies: to invest in the assets of companies whose price was rising. Thus, the majority of technology companies do not produce cash flow but are financed through “funding” which inflates their assets on paper.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Initially, <strong>Taleb had a favourable attitude toward cryptocurrencies since he disagreed with the monetary measures taken by former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis</strong>. He now thinks that manipulators and con artists are becoming more attracted to digital currencies, where they may prey on unwary investors who have been duped by claims of quick and exorbitant rewards.</p>



<p>However, it is possible that digital money may replace traditional finance if the system ever manages to become <strong>regulated, serious, and honest.</strong></p>

<p>Following a <a href="https://www.dfs.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2023/01/ea20230104_coinbase.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">settlement</a> with the regulator, which discovered glaring gaps in the cryptocurrency exchange&#8217;s review of customer IDs and notifications on transactions, the NYDFS fined Coinbase <strong>$50 million</strong> and compelled the company to invest another <strong>$50 million into its compliance program.</strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Coinbase lacked sufficient personnel, resources, and tools needed to keep up with these alerts, and backlogs rapidly grew to unmanageable levels. By the end of 2021, Coinbase had a backlog of unreviewed transaction monitoring alerts grew to more than 100,000 (many of which were months old), and the backlog of customers requiring enhanced due diligence (&#8216;EDD&#8217;) exceeded 14,000,&#8221; the settlement said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Since <strong>2017</strong>, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/157571-coinbase-users-refuse-to-reveal-information/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a> has had a license to run a virtual currency and money-transfer company in <strong>New York</strong>. Early in 2022, when the <strong>NYDFS</strong> discovered flaws in the exchange <strong>Know Your Customer (KYC)</strong> and transaction monitoring policies, the regulator established an impartial monitor to help the company address the issues.</p>



<p>The crypto exchange allegedly <strong>had numerous compliance &#8220;deficiencies&#8221; in relation to AML regulations</strong>, according to the financial authority. The <strong>NYDFS</strong> reported problems with user onboarding and transaction monitoring procedures.</p>

<p>Details of an early 2021 event in which a user stole <strong>$150 million</strong> from an undisclosed corporation by opening an account on the company&#8217;s behalf at Coinbase while posing as an employee despite providing insufficient documentation are included in the settlement. </p>



<p>The person gained access to the business&#8217;s bank account and then multiplied the company&#8217;s daily withdrawal cap by <strong>50</strong> before transferring <strong>$150 million</strong> to the exchange. He changed the fiat deposit into cryptocurrency and transferred it to a different wallet off-platform. </p>



<p>For six days, <strong>the exchange was ignorant of the activity until the company&#8217;s bank got in touch with it</strong>. The questioned cryptocurrency was eventually located by law enforcement, who then gave it back to the owner.</p>



<p>Coinbase chief legal officer <strong>Paul Grewal</strong> spoke out about the news:</p>

<p>The year 2022 did not turn out to be the best one for cryptocurrencies in general. Despite this, Dogecoin had<strong> a positive month</strong> around the time that<strong> </strong><a href="https://news.coincu.com/155857-elon-musk-dogecoin-scam-promoted-hack/"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></a> was buying Twitter. The lengthy bad market wiped out much of the profits, which meant that the rally didn&#8217;t last very long. This token has a dedicated following all around the world, <strong>notably in India</strong>, despite the fact that its price is highly erratic.</p>



<p>Dogecoin has risen to become one of the assets that are held by the most people, according to the most recent tweet from CoinSwitch, one of the main cryptocurrency exchanges in India. On CoinSwitch, DOGE joined <strong>Bitcoin and Ethereum</strong> as one of the <strong>top three most owned cryptocurrencies in 2022.</strong></p>

<p>Since it first appeared online, the coin meme has undergone significant development. The journey that <strong>DOGE</strong> has taken from<strong> the standpoint of a meme to where it is now is very incredible</strong>. According to the most recent findings from IntoTheBlock, 53 percent of DOGE holders are making money. More than seventy percent of its holders have held onto it for a year or more.</p>

<p>Coincu News reported <strong>on December 31</strong> that rumors on social media that Dogecoin may switch to a <strong>more energy-efficient proof-of-stake design</strong>, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/157020-dogecoin-drops-13-ethereum-like-merger/">similar to Ethereum&#8217;s long-awaited merger in September</a>, have prompted one of Dogecoin&#8217;s top engineers to deny that any big change is imminent. Dogecoin&#8217;s price has <strong>dropped 13% in a week and 6% in 24 hours to slightly less than $0.07</strong>. The notoriously volatile meme coin fell this week over fears about potential changes to the cryptocurrency&#8217;s existing energy-intensive proof-of-work mining algorithm.</p>



<p>Rumors circulating on social media that Dogecoin may transition to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake architecture, akin to Ethereum&#8217;s long-awaited merger in September, have <strong>prompted one of Dogecoin&#8217;s major engineers </strong>to deny that any significant change is imminent. Dogecoin, with a market cap of almost <strong>$9.3 billion</strong>, is the second largest proof-of-work cryptocurrency, trailing Bitcoin&#8217;s market worth of<strong> $316 billion</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>Financial Conduct Authority</strong> discovered that between <strong>March 2021</strong> and <strong>April 2022</strong>, financial fraud alerts in the UK were most prevalent in the cryptocurrency sector.

<p>The new NCA crypto crime unit will be responsible for <strong>advising detectives on both the strategic and tactical aspects of cases involving cryptocurrencies</strong>, helping both ongoing and fresh investigations. Experience in locating and recovering seed words as well as sophisticated blockchain tracing are requirements for the post.</p>



<p>The decision to establish a law enforcement unit with a focus on cryptocurrencies comes in response to an increase in cryptocurrency fraud in the UK and the National Police Chiefs&#8217; Council&#8217;s placement of crypto tactical advisers in police stations nationwide last year. In November, lawmakers <a href="https://news.coincu.com/146983-uk-crypto-fraud-rose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decided</a> to give local law enforcement the authority to seize cryptocurrency linked to criminal and terrorist activity.</p>

<p>The falling value of crypto assets does not deter well-known sites from incorporating them. <strong>BONE</strong>, a minor actor in the Shiba Inu ecosystem, did well. <a href="https://news.coincu.com/155778-shiba-inu-supply-held-by-whales-levels/">Shiba Inu (SHIB)</a> fans and investors are eagerly awaiting <strong>the debut of Shibarium</strong>, the project&#8217;s layer 2 network.</p>



<p><strong>The launch</strong> was pushed back from its planned <strong>Q3 release</strong> date due to development problems. The company has guaranteed consumers, however, that <strong>Shibarium will be ready by the end of 2022. </strong>However, things did not proceed as planned.</p>



<p>According to CoinMarketCap data, BONE has <strong>gained 10%</strong> in the <strong>last 7 days</strong> amid market turbulence. According to Coinecko, this token is up <strong>13.1% in the last 14 days</strong>.</p>

<p>BONE, Shiba In&#8217;s offspring token, will be crucial in <strong>the upcoming layer 2</strong>. The token will be used by <strong>SHIB layer 2 validators</strong>, according to the team. BONE minting was <strong>halted at 230 million </strong>in order to use the remaining<strong> 20 million BONE for Shibarium validators</strong> (as opposed to the original plan of 250 million).</p>



<p>The arrival of Shibarium has been greatly sought after and anticipated. Shibarium will help<strong> reduce the costs associated with transactions</strong>, while also <strong>increasing the speed</strong> at which they may be completed. When Shibarium is eventually made available to the public, it will contribute to the acceleration of the burn rate by depositing additional SHIB into dead wallets. However, the company has not announced a specific date for when Shibarium would be available to the public.</p>

<p>The phishing event was <a href="https://t.me/GMX_IO/325980" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> by the administrator of GMX&#8217;s Telegram channel, who also made it clear that there were no security issues with the GMX platform itself.</p>



<p>On-chain data reveals that the perpetrator began withdrawing money from the victim&#8217;s wallet on <strong>January 3</strong> around <strong>7 PM UTC</strong>.

<p><strong>On January 4th,</strong> <strong>Magic Eden</strong>, the NFT market for the Solana chain, tweeted that it had learned about the problem of customers <strong>buying fake NFT</strong>s on this platform and had added <strong>further verification levels</strong> to address it. These verification levels were added because Magic Eden had learned about the problem. The platform expressed gratitude to its users for drawing their attention to a potential issue in which clients can obtain <strong>fake ABC NFTs</strong>. If users are affected, they have the option of seeking assistance from the help center provided by Magic Eden.</p>



<p><strong>Users of Magic Eden</strong> reported seeing<strong> </strong><a href="https://news.coincu.com/157948-magic-eden-appears-bad-nft/"><strong>indecent photos</strong></a> and Big Bang Theory stills in place of their NFT artwork on Monday night. It was stated that Magic Eden claimed that the <strong>poor quality photographs</strong> on the platform were the result of the image provider being hacked, but <strong>the site itself was not affected</strong>. The message was issued after the incident was reported on Twitter by a few people who wanted an explanation from the social media site.</p>

<p>Because of the <strong>instability of Solana</strong> following the death of FTX, Magic Eden has been focusing its efforts on <strong>expanding to other blockchains</strong> and improving its gaming sector. This is due to the fact that Solana&#8217;s price has been fluctuating. Thanks to the company&#8217;s integration with<strong> </strong><a href="https://news.coincu.com/152449-magic-eden-allows-polygon-nft/"><strong>the Polygon network</strong></a>, which it stated plans to achieve<strong> in November</strong>, the marketplace will have the ability to work together with strategic<strong> IP owners, top-tier game developers, and up-and-coming creators</strong> from the Polygon ecosystem. This will allow the marketplace to better serve its customers.</p>

<p>Paul threatened to <strong>sue Coffeezilla for spreading false information and distributing an &#8220;illegal recording.&#8221; </strong>The tape in question was a private phone call between Paul and his manager Jeff Levin, which Coffeezilla had made public on his YouTube channel.</p>

<p>Paul also stated that he unwittingly recruited criminals to work on the projects. <strong>He singled out a blockchain engineer named Zack Kelling, who was essential to Coffeezilla&#8217;s investigation</strong>. In order to substantiate the criminal aspect, Paul claimed that Kelling had repeated run-ins with the law and that Coffeezilla had not purposefully fact-checked the developer.</p>



<p>He went on to say that the engineer fled to Switzerland with the source code and was holding it hostage for $1 million.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Coffeezilla alleged that the project&#8217;s creators, numbering around 30, <strong>had not been paid since the game was not playable</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>It&#8217;s interesting that Coffeezilla said Paul&#8217;s team didn&#8217;t spend the $1 million they had originally claimed to have put into making the game</strong>. They substituted existing programming code for their own by stealing it. Paul emphasized that the game was still under production and that the company only had three devs.</p>
