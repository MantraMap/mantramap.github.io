										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>BNB&#8217;s value has fallen due to external pressures and investor sentiment, failing to break through the Fib 23.6% level and currently trading below $240.</em></li>



<li><em>The market for Binance Coin is currently pessimistic due to regulatory issues related to the Binance exchange.</em></li>



<li><em>If the coin breaks below the $220-$225 price zone, it could lead to panic selling, but a slow rally could help strengthen its position and potentially reclaim the $250 price point.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>BNB still seems to be in a pessimistic state, as the whole market is still bullish. The reason is why?</strong></h5>



<p>The date of Greenfield&#8217;s future maintenance update has been revealed by BNB Chain. The update will not only correct a few flaws in BNB Greenfield, but it will also include a slew of new features.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1869.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1869-1024x576.png" alt="BNB Can&#039;t Break Through $255, What Happens Next?" class="wp-image-197795" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1869-1024x576.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1869-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1869-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1869-1536x864.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1869-750x422.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1869-1140x641.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1869.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="BNB Can&#039;t Break Through $255, What Happens Next? 1"></a></figure></div>


<p>According to the notice, all objects previously saved on the Greenfield Testnet will be wiped and will no longer be accessible for inquiry. Some noteworthy features include support for multiple messages in a transaction using the EIP712 sign method.</p>



<p>BNB will provide functionality that will enable mirroring buckets, objects, or groups by ID or name. Moreover, the upgrade will add keyManager support to txOpt, allowing it to manage a huge batch of transactions submitted by a single client.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Binance-BNB-Greenfield-pruebas-1024x576.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Binance-BNB-Greenfield-pruebas-1024x576.jpg" alt="BNB Can&#039;t Break Through $255, What Happens Next?" class="wp-image-197796" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Binance-BNB-Greenfield-pruebas-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Binance-BNB-Greenfield-pruebas-300x169.jpg 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Binance-BNB-Greenfield-pruebas-768x432.jpg 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Binance-BNB-Greenfield-pruebas-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Binance-BNB-Greenfield-pruebas-750x422.jpg 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Binance-BNB-Greenfield-pruebas-1140x641.jpg 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Binance-BNB-Greenfield-pruebas.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="BNB Can&#039;t Break Through $255, What Happens Next? 2"></a></figure></div>


<p>Despite the fact that developers were working on the upgrade, BNB, like many other tokens, saw its value fall. This can be seen as external pressure, as the legal issues between the US and Binance are still unclear.</p>



<p>Binance, the world&#8217;s biggest cryptocurrency exchange, has formally revoked its registration in the United Kingdom, according to the latest news. Binance&#8217;s proposal to deregister Binance Markets Limited (BML) on May 30, 2023, was granted by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), essentially terminating the company&#8217;s ability to perform regulated services in the nation.</p>



<p>Binance&#8217;s decision to leave the United Kingdom follows a string of regulatory hurdles for the cryptocurrency exchange. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the United States and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) of the United States have both filed complaints against Binance, citing numerous offenses such as deceptive tactics and manipulative trading.</p>



<p>BNB is currently trading below $240, which is a modest gain or not to say very concerned about the $220 support area it broke above two weeks ago.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>BNB is failing to break through the Fib 23.6% level, which shows a lot of selling pressure due to investor sentiment. Keep an eye on the $220-$225 price zone once again because if it breaks, it will most likely be a panic sell for BNB.</p>



<p>Currently, due to investors&#8217; risk aversion to the Binance exchange, holding and buying BNB at this time is relatively risky and risky. However, if the market continues to rally with Bitcoin&#8217;s price rise, BNB could reclaim the $250 price point once again. A steady and slow rally to the $255 price zone will help strengthen BNB&#8217;s uptrend.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>DeFi tokens have grown significantly in market capitalization over the past week, with tokens such as UNI and LINK experiencing gains of over 20%.</em></li>



<li><em>AAVE has seen the most impressive growth among DeFi tokens, increasing by 40% over the last seven days.</em></li>



<li><em>The growth of DeFi tokens is partly due to regulatory pressures on traditional finance, and their decentralization makes them more attractive to institutional investors.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>DeFi tokens have generally risen in recent times as the tokens are at a disadvantage with regulatory pressure in the United States.</strong></h5>

<p>DeFi tokens have generally risen in recent times as the tokens are at a disadvantage with regulatory pressure in the United States.</p>



<p>According to CoinGecko statistics, DeFi tokens have seen impressive growth in the past week, with market capitalization increasing from $41.5 billion to $46.2 billion.</p>



<p>The top DeFi tokens in terms of gains include UNI and LINK, with over 20% in the last 7 days. Notably, AAVE has increased by 40%, an achievement that far exceeds that of other tokens.</p>

<p>Since the US Securities and Exchange Commission considers decentralization to be one of the requirements for determining whether a token is a security, tokens such as PoW, DeFi, and meme coins may be invested in by institutional funds. Tokens driven by venture capital and extremely centralized, on the other hand, maybe bad.</p>



<p>The growth of DeFi tokens is also supported by Bitcoin as it crossed the $31,000 mark in the past week, sparking investor confidence.</p>



<p>The surge comes after BlackRock, the world&#8217;s largest asset management, submitted to the US Securities and Exchange Commission last week for a spot Bitcoin ETF, which the agency has yet to approve.</p>

<p>EDX Markets, a new digital asset exchange sponsored by prominent Wall Street giants Fidelity, Charles Schwab, and Citadel Securities, debuted earlier this week. </p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinGecko</a>, the whole cryptocurrency market value is currently around $1.235 trillion, a 0.5% increase in the last 24 hours. However, we should probably wait for a slight correction from Bitcoin to enter this risky game, as DeFi&#8217;s strong growth is easy to dissipate if the major coins are not likely to rise. </p>

<p>Orbiter Finance <a href="https://twitter.com/BitKeepOS/status/1672831978369081344" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted</a> on social media in response to CertiK warned that its official tweet was hacked and stated that its official Twitter account is safe and has not been hacked.</p>



<p>Yesterday, the link posted was a joint event with the official BitKeep Wallet team. Currently, in order to prevent counterfeit use of the event information, the event has been temporarily <a href="https://news.coincu.com/197671-orbiter-finance-stops-events-bitkeep-wallet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suspended</a>.</p>



<p>Orbiter Finance also announced that it would partner with the decentralized multi-chain cryptocurrency wallet project BitKeep to conduct an exclusive airdrop.</p>



<p>Coincu previously <a href="https://news.coincu.com/197635-orbiter-finance-twitter-account-hacked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that CertiK Alert detected that Orbiter Finance&#8217;s official tweet had been hacked and posted phishing links, reminding users not to click, interact or download links and documents posted on Twitter document.</p>



<p>At the beginning of June, malicious actors hacked Orbiter Finance&#8217;s Discord channel and provided a link to a bogus airdrop program. This is the most recent attack against the project.</p>

<p>The attackers lost little time in publicizing a bogus ORB token launch and an airdrop event. They say that 5,000,000 ORB tokens will be issued to Orbiter Finance community members. The Orbiter Finance team acknowledged the attack on Twitter, telling followers that they are working hard to reclaim control of the hijacked Discord server.</p>



<p>Orbiter Finance is a decentralized cross-rollup bridge to transfer assets on Ethereum, a Layer 2 infrastructure and an optimized project with low cost and near-instant transfer speed.</p>

<p>This transaction is an excellent example of the potential of real-world assets (RWA) tokenization, which allows tokenizing the ownership rights of an asset on a blockchain. The tokenization of assets in DeFi is a hot topic, and it is one of the most prominent areas in the space. Many real-world assets can be tokenized, including stocks, government bonds, real estate, and commodities.</p>

<p>Found, the bankruptcy claims platform, confirmed that the original creditor and lender went through its biometric Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering screenings. The company&#8217;s website states that users can access loans using bankruptcy claims as collateral, with a 10% transaction fee on successful trades.</p>



<p>FTX filed for bankruptcy in November 2022, resulting in billions of dollars being locked in users&#8217; accounts for court proceedings. According to some estimates, FTX claim holders could recover between 35% and 66% of their face value. The surge in bankruptcy filings in the crypto industry is driving on-chain claims solutions.

<p><a href="https://news.coincu.com/160966-korbit-strengthen-account-monitoring/">Korbit</a>, as a leading South Korean cryptocurrency exchange, offers a range of features that cater to the needs of traders and investors in the local market. In this section, we will explore the key features of the Korbit platform, including its trading interface, available instruments, account types, and more.</p>

While Korbit does not offer a dedicated mobile app, its web platform is optimized for use on mobile devices, enabling users to trade on the go.</p>



<p>The web-based platform on Korbit features a clear separation between charting tools and the trade execution interface.

<p>The charting tools provided on Korbit&#8217;s platform are basic, offering essential analysis capabilities.

<h1 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" style="font-size:32px">Introduction</h1>



<p>The Maverick Protocol (MAV) has garnered significant attention from investors since it was selected as the 34th Launchpool project on Binance. Despite being a relatively new project launched in March, Maverick has already achieved impressive results in terms of fee revenue on the protocol.</p>



<p>One of the standout features of Maverick is its Automated Market Maker (AMM) technology, which optimizes capital utilization by automatically concentrating liquidity during price volatility conditions. This enhances capital efficiency, increases market liquidity, and benefits traders with better prices, while liquidity providers earn additional fee revenue. Furthermore, Maverick&#8217;s integrated feature eliminates the need for costly gas fees by automatically adjusting trading positions based on the price level.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1856.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="720" height="360" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1856.png" alt="Maverick Protocol&#039;s Voting-Escrow Model: A New Dawn For Liquid Staking Protocols" class="wp-image-197708" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1856.png 720w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1856-300x150.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1856-360x180.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" title="Maverick Protocol&#039;s Voting-Escrow Model: A New Dawn For Liquid Staking Protocols 24"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Liquidity providers now have the option to track the price of an asset in a single direction and effectively speculate on the price trajectory of a specific token. This approach is similar to one-sided liquidity strategies, where providers focus on a particular asset within a specific group.</p>



<p>These technological innovations are revolutionizing liquidity management models through the use of smart contracts. Maverick stands out as the first Dynamic Distribution AMM protocol capable of automating liquidity strategies that previously required daily maintenance or super complex protocols. The project pioneers a new approach and brings new opportunities to the decentralized finance sector.</p>



<p>Maverick has raised $17,460,000 through three rounds of private token sales to fund its development, selling 360,000,000 out of the total token supply of 2,000,000,000 MAV. In the most recent private token sale round, the MAV price was $0.1. As of June 13th, 2023, the total supply of MAV is 2,000,000,000, and the circulating supply upon listing will be 250,000,000 (~12.5% of the total token supply).</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1854.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="720" height="405" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1854.png" alt="Maverick Protocol&#039;s Voting-Escrow Model: A New Dawn For Liquid Staking Protocols" class="wp-image-197706" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1854.png 720w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1854-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" title="Maverick Protocol&#039;s Voting-Escrow Model: A New Dawn For Liquid Staking Protocols 25"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The MAV token serves as a joint utility and governance token, enabling stakeholders to stake, vote, and direct community and ecosystem incentives. These utilities operate on a voting-escrow model, where MAV holders stake their tokens to receive a vote-escrowed MAV (veMAV) balance. </p>



<p>With Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) emerging as the next crucial DeFi primitive, the stage is set for intense competition among liquid staking protocols reminiscent of the Curve Wars. As veCRV played a critical role in the Curve Wars, veMAV is expected to be pivotal in the upcoming <a href="https://blockworks.co/news/ethereum-shanghai-liquid-staking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LST Wars</a>.</p>



<p>The stakes in the LST Wars resemble those of the Curve Wars: LST protocols require liquidity and trading volume for their tokens to gain traction, and they are already competing by offering various incentives to achieve their objectives.</p>



<p>The Curve Wars were contested by protocols now among the most prominent names in the crypto space, including FRAX, USDC, and USDT. Similarly, in the LST Wars, established players like Lido, Rocketpool, and Frax are already in the arena, alongside smaller LST projects emerging each week. These protocols are vying for a share of the same market and seeking a competitive edge.</p>



<p>Maverick&#8217;s Dynamic Distribution AMM has already proven to be an ideal fit for LST liquidity due to its native automation of liquidity movements that track the natural yield of LSTs over time. Since its launch in March, the Maverick AMM has facilitated over $1 billion in trading volume for wstETH, accounting for 30% of all wstETH trading in DeFi. The list of LSTs available on Maverick continues to grow, including wstETH, swETH, cbETH, and rETH.</p>

<p>Recently, Maverick Protocol has made significant strides in enhancing the utility and governance features of its MAV token through the introduction of the Voting-Escrow Model. This innovative mechanism has garnered attention and is poised to play a pivotal role in shaping the protocol&#8217;s future. Let&#8217;s explore what the Voting-Escrow Model is and how it functions.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" style="font-size:32px">What is a voting-escrow model?</h1>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1853.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="720" height="685" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1853.png" alt="Maverick Protocol&#039;s Voting-Escrow Model: A New Dawn For Liquid Staking Protocols" class="wp-image-197705" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1853.png 720w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1853-300x285.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" title="Maverick Protocol&#039;s Voting-Escrow Model: A New Dawn For Liquid Staking Protocols 27"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Curve first introduced the voting-escrow (ve) concept and later adopted by numerous decentralized exchanges (DEXs). It establishes a decentralized governance system that ensures voting power remains in the hands of users who demonstrate commitment to a protocol&#8217;s long-term growth and development.</p>



<p>In the ve model, token holders must deposit the protocol token (e.g., MAV) into a &#8220;ve&#8221; contract in exchange for voting power, represented by a veMAV balance—the voting power increases based on the duration and size of the stake. The tokens staked by users are locked in the ve contract until the staking period expires. This mechanism prevents opportunistic voting power from manipulating the governance process to harm the protocol&#8217;s users and community members.</p>



<p>The advent of Curve&#8217;s vote-escrowed token (veCRV) led to the emergence of the Curve Wars. These wars resulted from two complementary innovations: first, Curve&#8217;s pioneering stableswap automated market maker (AMM) achieved a unique fit with the growing stablecoin sector, and second, the veCRV system offered a means for projects to compete for an advantage in the expanding stablecoin market.</p>



<p>Similarly, with the introduction of veMAV, Maverick now possesses a comparable framework that could become the battleground for the LST Wars. Firstly, Maverick AMM&#8217;s dynamic distribution mechanism provides a native solution for liquidity provisioning of LST pairs, just as stableswap AMM did for stablecoins. Secondly, the veMAV system will offer LST projects a fresh strategic option in their quest for liquidity within the AMM ecosystem.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" style="font-size:32px">What Makes Maverick&#8217;s VE Model Worthy?</h1>



<p>Maverick&#8217;s VE (Voting Escrow) model offers compelling advantages that make it worth your attention, particularly if you are involved in liquid staking protocols or other projects seeking to bootstrap liquidity or incentivize a price peg.</p>



<p>The VE-based governance mechanics implemented by Maverick play a crucial role in attracting liquidity providers (LPs) to Boosted Positions and effectively competing with other projects for liquidity. By utilizing the veMAV (Voting Escrowed MAV) token to direct user incentives within the Automated Market Maker (AMM), Maverick enables projects to align their interests with the accumulation of veMAV voting power.</p>



<p>This alignment of interests leads to projects exploring additional incentives for veMAV holders to utilize their veMAV in ways that benefit their respective projects. Consequently, veMAV holders gain greater value and influence within the ecosystem.</p>



<p>One of the standout features of Maverick&#8217;s VE model, compared to existing VE systems like Curve and Balancer, is its critical improvement in targeting voting power to specific parts of the AMM distribution. Unlike other VE models that act as blunt instruments for incentivizing liquidity, Maverick allows protocols to create Boosted Positions, specific liquidity distributions within a given pool. Through the veMAV model, protocols can precisely drive incentives toward these Boosted Positions.</p>



<p>This precision empowers protocols with what can be described as &#8220;incentive efficiency,&#8221; enabling them to optimize the allocation of incentives to meet their liquidity goals with minimal capital expenditure.</p>



<p>Metaprotocols such as Convex and Aura have evolved to facilitate similar dynamics in other VE-based systems. It is highly likely that comparable metaprotocols will emerge specifically tailored for Maverick. These metaprotocols simplify the voting and direction mechanisms for ve holders while maximizing the utility of ve tokens through aggregated market power.</p>



<p>A common mechanism employed by metaprotocols involves attracting incentives from protocols to direct voting power to a specific position. Ultimately, these incentives flow back to the MAV community members, ensuring the value and engagement of the ecosystem.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" style="font-size:32px">Conclusion</h1>



<p>Maverick&#8217;s VE model presents a unique opportunity for projects involved in liquid staking protocols and others seeking to bootstrap liquidity. By utilizing veMAV, protocols can precisely incentivize liquidity, drive engagement, and enhance their overall efficiency in achieving their liquidity objectives. Furthermore, the emergence of metaprotocols tailored for Maverick is likely to amplify the benefits and utility of the veMAV ecosystem.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Despite encouraging advancements in the Solana network, the native cryptocurrency, Solana (SOL), has performed poorly, with a sustained negative bias.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Solana has seen a sustained negative bias despite encouraging developments in its network.</li>



<li>Recent legal developments and regulatory ambiguity have contributed to the negative trend, including lawsuits brought by the SEC against major cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance and Coinbase.</li>



<li>The increased popularity of Solana&#8217;s network due to high Ethereum gas fees and the surge in Bitcoin&#8217;s price could possibly aid SOL&#8217;s recovery from the current decline.</li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Despite encouraging advancements in the Solana network, the native cryptocurrency, Solana (SOL), has performed poorly, with a sustained negative bias.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1850.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="900" height="500" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1850.png" alt="Solana Is Rising Weakly, Will It Return To The $20 Price Zone?" class="wp-image-197700" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1850.png 900w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1850-300x167.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1850-768x427.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1850-750x417.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" title="Solana Is Rising Weakly, Will It Return To The $20 Price Zone? 28"></a></figure></div>


<p>This negative trend may be ascribed to a variety of macroeconomic issues, including concerns about the US debt limit and debates about worldwide cryptocurrency legislation.</p>



<p>Bakkt, a New York-based derivatives exchange, delisted prominent cryptocurrencies, which was a major move altering the altcoin scene. This decision was driven by recent legal developments in the United States, including lawsuits brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against major cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase.</p>



<p>The SEC labeled over 20 digital assets, including SOL, as securities in their litigation cases. As a consequence of the accompanying regulatory ambiguity, several trading platforms, such as Robinhood, have discontinued coverage for certain assets.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1851.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="980" height="653" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1851.png" alt="Solana Is Rising Weakly, Will It Return To The $20 Price Zone?" class="wp-image-197701" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1851.png 980w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1851-300x200.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1851-768x512.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1851-750x500.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" title="Solana Is Rising Weakly, Will It Return To The $20 Price Zone? 29"></a></figure></div>


<p>Nevertheless, Bitcoin has just surpassed $31,000 due to a wave of confidence from institutional investors who began scrutinizing the commodity after a high-profile ETF application and the debut of a new crypto exchange.</p>



<p>The surge comes after BlackRock, the world&#8217;s largest asset manager, submitted to the US Securities and Exchange Commission last week for a spot Bitcoin ETF.</p>



<p>Moreover, the increased popularity of the meme token Pepecoin (PEPE) has contributed to the Ethereum network&#8217;s skyrocketing transaction costs. Because of the increase in Ethereum gas fees, consumers are looking for alternatives, such as the Solana network, for quicker and more cost-effective transactions.</p>



<p>The increased usage of Solana&#8217;s network might possibly sustain SOL&#8217;s stock and help it recover from the current decline. Investors are currently debating whether it is a good time to buy SOL since its price forecast indicates an upward trend.</p>



<p>Solana&#8217;s price has just begun a new upward trend from the $13.5 support zone. Bitcoin and Ethereum have recently seen sustained gains, generating good movements in Solana and Cardano.</p>



<p>The bulls are actively pushing the price up from the old support area that SOL broke earlier, $17. Besides, SOL price is currently trading above the 26.6% Fib level, creating the premise for a correction around the $16.2 price zone before it bounces up further.</p>

<p>SOL is now trading above $17, but traders should note that the $20 price level is extremely important as it is the confluence of the 50% Fib and the bearish trend line created from the April top. At this price, SOL will bounce up very strongly.</p>
