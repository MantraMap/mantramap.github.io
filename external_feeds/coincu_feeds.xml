<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>According to proposals agreed upon by the French Senate&#8217;s Economy Committee, social media influencers could promote the goods of registered crypto firms.</em></li>



<li><em>The proposal would enable cryptocurrency corporations to pay influencers for publicity.</em></li>



<li><em>Previously, the National Assembly took a tougher stance.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The French National Assembly is attempting to essentially outlaw social media crypto marketing, while a crucial Senate committee seems to support softer limitations.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-82.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-82-1024x576.png" alt="French Senate Considers Allowing Influencers To Promote Crypto" class="wp-image-185179" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-82-1024x576.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-82-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-82-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-82-750x422.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-82-1140x641.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-82.png 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="French Senate Considers Allowing Influencers To Promote Crypto 2"></a></figure></div>


<p>According to ideas <a href="https://www.senat.fr/amendements/commissions/2022-2023/489/Amdt_COM-48.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">agreed</a> upon by the French Senate&#8217;s Economy Committee on Wednesday, social media influencers would be able to advertise goods of registered crypto companies such as Binance.</p>



<p>The new translation would enable corporations registered with France&#8217;s Financial Markets Authority (AMF) to employ influencers for their goods, according to a translation given by Bing:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“The current wording is more restrictive than the existing provisions in the Consumer Code, since it excludes the possibility for digital asset service providers (PSAN) registered with the Financial Markets Authority (AMF) to use commercial influence. Consequently, this amendment introduces this possibility for PSANs registered or approved with the AMF.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Senators seem to prefer less stringent rules than their colleagues in Paris&#8217; National Assembly, which voted in March to virtually prohibit crypto advertisements by social media celebrities.</p>



<p>The measure in issue originally called for what amounted to an outright prohibition on influencer promotion for the crypto company in France. Its language restricted firms from engaging in influencer advertising to those regulated by the AMF, a requirement that no crypto company presently satisfies.</p>



<p>The measure, which was approved in committee and will be debated in the Senate plenary next week, would enable cryptocurrency firms to pay for publicity via influencers provided they are registered with or have a license from authorities.</p>



<p>According to an explanatory note by lead legislator Amel Gacquerre of the Centrist Union party, the Senate proposal matches the measure with the current French Consumer Law. The measure also prohibits influencers from promoting cosmetics and gaming.</p>



<p>The National Assembly earlier adopted a harder stance, stating that influencers should only be permitted to promote items from AMF-licensed crypto enterprises.</p>



<p>All crypto companies operating in France are obliged by law to register with the AMF. So far, none have received the necessary licensing to legally hire influencers to promote their products in the country.</p>



<p>Hundreds of companies, including Binance, Bitstamp, and eToro, have registered with the authority, confirming that they fulfill money laundering and governance standards.</p>



<p>The amendment&#8217;s modification in terminology would abolish the license requirement, allowing organizations that are just registered with the AMF to pay influencers for social media advertising.</p>

<p>The stake is a core service of Coinbase Cloud by its Multi-Cloud, Multi-Region Infrastructure to support competitive uptime. The platform has deep experience running nodes in high throughput networks, including Aptos, Solana, Ethereum, Algorand, Flow, and more. Besides that, it also has high standards for its products&#8217; quality, reliability, and security.</p>



<p>Through the partnership, Coinbase Cloud announced it would be able to provide developers with a secure and trusted Sui unsecured staking infrastructure that can be integrated with a custodial solution elect to offer staking services to their end users.</p>



<p>Sui&#8217;s gas price mechanism uses the Gas Price Survey to set a reference price and the Tally Rules for community-driven price enforcement. It aims to provide low, predictable transaction fees by having validators agree on a Reference Price across the network at each starting point.</p>



<p>That will make the blockchain achieve high performance and faster transaction speed. In addition, lower network fees for users do not spike during periods of increased activity.</p>



<p>According to the announcement, to overcome the congestion, the public blockchain will use two protocols in parallel:</p>



<ul>
<li>Byzantine consistent broadcasting for simple transactions.</li>



<li>Narwhal/Bullshark consensus for complex, interdependent transactions.</li>
</ul>



<p>After waiting, the Sui blockchain finally deployed and issued <a href="https://news.coincu.com/185129-binance-and-bybit-defy-sui-teams-request/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SUI tokens</a>. The tokens were listed and opened for trading on major exchanges, including Binance, OKX, Huobi, Kucoin, Bitfinex, etc.</p>

<p>The awaited blockchain uses the Move programming language developed by Facebook, similar to its rival Aptos (APT). According to blockchain data, at the time of implementation, Sui&#8217;s validators were staking up to 4.2 billion tokens to participate in validating transactions through more than 2,100 nodes, concentrated in the US, Germany, Eastern Europe, and East Asia.</p>

<p>According to court documents filed Wednesday, the monies are related to $1.8 billion in loans and $273 million in collateral granted to Genesis Global Capital by Alameda Research, Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s defunct crypto trading company, just before it crashed into bankruptcy with FTX.</p>



<p>FTX is also attempting to recoup $1.6 billion in alleged Genesis withdrawals and an additional $213 million allegedly removed through its BVI-based business GGC International from the exchange before it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on November 11.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">FTX moves to claw back $3.9 billion from Genesis.<br><br>1. $2.1 billion loan repayments/collateral pledge<br>2. $1.8 billion FTX exchange withdrawals <a href="https://t.co/1SsW8yoPck" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/1SsW8yoPck</a></p>&mdash; FTX 2.0 shareholder (in spe) (@AFTXcreditor) <a href="https://twitter.com/AFTXcreditor/status/1653883349021106179?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 3, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The filing showed that Genesis was mostly compensated for over $8 billion in loans granted to Alameda Research, an FTX-affiliated firm, in the weeks preceding the exchange&#8217;s bankruptcy in November. Genesis filed for bankruptcy in January.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;The Avoidance Actions will seek to claw back funds received by Genesis and non-debtor affiliates so that these funds can be shared with all other creditors of the FTX Debtors in the FTX Chapter 11 Cases. These creditors include several million customers owed over $11 billion as of the time of filing of FTX Chapter 11 Cases,&#8221; according to the filing.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It is attempting to recoup the monies using bankruptcy procedures meant to guarantee that no creditors are favored over others. Avoidable transfers are ones that occur up to 90 days before a corporation goes insolvent. However, attempts to recoup funds through bankruptcy are not always successful.</p>



<p>Past the exchange, clawbacks have centered on $3.2 billion in compensation to former executives, a $460 million investment by Alameda into venture capital company Modulo Capital, and roughly $93 million in political contributions made by founder Sam Bankman-Fried and other former top commanders.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Coinbase will no longer issue new loans using a program that allows users to borrow using Bitcoin as collateral.</em></li>



<li><em>New loans through the service will be discontinued on May 10, the company announced late Wednesday.</em></li>



<li><em>Customers&#8217; outstanding debts will be unaffected, according to the company.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Coinbase, the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States, will cease making new loans via a program that allows customers to borrow using Bitcoin as collateral.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-74.png"><img decoding="async" width="1200" height="628" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-74.png" alt="Coinbase To Stop New Loans Via Borrow Service" class="wp-image-185159" title="Coinbase To Stop New Loans Via Borrow Service 12"></a></figure></div>


<p>Clients of the US-based exchange who utilized the scheme, which enabled them to borrow fiat loans of up to $1 million against up to 30% of their Bitcoin holdings with interest, got an email on Wednesday alerting them that the final day to take out fresh loans was May 10. Customers&#8217; outstanding debts will be unaffected, according to the company.</p>



<p>Coinbase Borrow only makes loans in select US states. The firm is scheduled to announce quarterly earnings on May 4th, despite the exchange&#8217;s persistent regulatory uncertainties.</p>



<p>According to the <em><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/05/04/coinbase-to-stop-issuing-new-loans-via-coinbase-borrow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CoinDesk</a></em> report, the shutdown of Coinbase Borrow seems to be unrelated to any enforcement action for the time being.</p>



<p>Following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, Coinbase has come under increased scrutiny from regulators and is expecting enforcement action from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for alleged securities violations.</p>



<p>Coinbase replies to the SEC&#8217;s Wells notice, noting that it works within legal boundaries and encourages genuine dialogue about a viable route ahead for the crypto sector.</p>



<p>Coinbase&#8217;s CEO, Brian Armstrong, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/184504-coinbase-responds-to-secs-wells-notice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">underlined</a> that the company is dedicated to operating within the regulatory framework and properly evaluates its offers. It does not list securities and rejects &#8220;about 90%&#8221; of the assets it examines.</p>



<p>Despite the regulatory concerns, the company is still prepared to defend its position in court. However, it believes that this is not necessary and welcomes an actual discussion about a viable path forward for the cryptocurrency industry.</p>



<p>Coinbase is also facing a class-action lawsuit alleging that the company <a href="https://news.coincu.com/184996-coinbase-accused-of-privacy-violations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">violated</a> Illinois biometric privacy regulations by collecting and storing client fingerprints and facial templates. A user argued that the exchange violated the Biometric Information Privacy Act of Illinois (BIPA).</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has removed the first official definition of &#8220;digital asset&#8221; in its latest household hedge withdrawal rules.</em></li>



<li><em>The Commission and staff continue to review the term and do not apply digital assets as part of this rule.</em></li>



<li><em>This week&#8217;s hedge withdrawal rule&#8217;s initial definition for a digital asset was not expansive or controversial.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In removing the first official definition of &#8220;digital assets&#8221; from hedge fund rules, most recently on Wednesday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) took a small step back in its efforts. The force that regulates the cryptocurrency industry.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-73.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-73-1024x576.png" alt="SEC Removes Definition Of &quot;Digital Asset&quot; In Latest Hedge Fund Rules" class="wp-image-185156" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-73-1024x576.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-73-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-73-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-73-1536x864.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-73-750x422.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-73-1140x641.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-73.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="SEC Removes Definition Of &quot;Digital Asset&quot; In Latest Hedge Fund Rules 15"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Although the SEC originally included this definition in its 2022 proposal. Mandatory disclosure reform for household rooms, in the final rule approved by the commissioners, the regulator The censorship securities regulator has eliminated this definition.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;The committee and staff are continuing to review the term and do not apply &#8216;digital assets&#8217; as part of this rule at this time,&#8221;</p>
<cite>The note stated.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Despite the decision to withdraw this decision, the agency is undoubtedly still looking into crypto issues as they have a significant impact on both their ongoing enforcement actions and regulatory proposals. Last month, the regulator effectively reversed course by revisiting a previously proposed rule that would clearly redefine the term &#8220;exchange&#8221; and include decentralized finance (DeFi).</p>



<p>The industry and two of the five SEC commissioners harshly criticized that amendment, which is among a number of recent policy changes that aim to incorporate cryptocurrencies into existing regulations explicitly. Another proposal from the SEC in February could ban financial advisors from maintaining assets in crypto businesses.</p>



<p>The original definition proposed for a digital asset in this week&#8217;s hedge fund rules did not expand or cause controversy, describing something like &#8220;using distributed ledgers or blockchain technology.&#8221; and includes &#8220;so-called &#8216;virtual currencies,&#8217; &#8216;coins&#8217; and &#8216;tokens.'&#8221;</p>



<p>But a lobbying organization for the industry, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association objected to the definition&#8217;s wording, saying that it &#8220;captures non-security digital asset classes, including commodities, bitcoin, and non-fungible tokens, but it is unclear whether the definition intended to capture any digital assets as opposed to all securities.&#8221; Sifma had therefore requested that the definition be more precise.</p>

<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission recently adopted amendments to modernize the requirements for disclosing information about an issuer&#8217;s equity security repurchases. These amendments enhance disclosure and provide investors with the information required to assess the purposes and effects of share repurchases.</p>



<p>According to Gary Gensler, the amendments will increase transparency and integrity in issuing transactions. Through the required disclosures, investors will be able to assess issuer buyback programs better and reduce information asymmetries between issuers and investors. This ultimately benefits investors, issuers, and the markets as a whole.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“Today’s amendments will increase the transparency and integrity of this significant means by which issuers transact in their own securities. Through these disclosures, investors will be able to better assess issuer buyback programs. The disclosures will also help lessen some of the information asymmetries inherent between issuers and investors in buybacks. That’s good for investors, issuers, and the markets.”</p>
<cite>said Gary Gensler</cite></blockquote>



<p>The amendments will require issuers to disclose daily quantitative share repurchase information either quarterly or semi-annually, providing a comprehensive view of their share repurchase activity. The required disclosures include the number of shares repurchased that day, the average price paid for the claims, and other relevant information. </p>



<p>Furthermore, issuers must check whether certain officers and directors traded in the relevant securities in the four business days before or after the announcement of the repurchase plan or program. This provides investors with a better understanding of insider trading activities.</p>



<p>In addition to the quantitative disclosures, the amendments expand the narrative repurchase disclosure requirements. Issuers must now disclose the objectives or rationales for share repurchases, the process or criteria used to determine the number of repurchases, and any policies and procedures relating to purchases and sales of the issuer&#8217;s securities during a repurchase program by its officers and directors, including any restrictions on such transactions. </p>

<p>The Federal Reserve has again made headlines by raising interest rates by 25 basis points. This decision was expected by many, as the Fed has been actively combating increasing inflation rates for the past ten years. This marks the 10th consecutive increase in a single year, with the potential for an end to the rise on the horizon.</p>



<p>Despite the current banking crisis in the US and calls to halt interest rate hikes, the Federal Reserve is still prioritizing its fight against inflation. As a result, interest rates have risen above the 5% mark, potentially negatively impacting the housing and job markets. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;The U.S. banking system is sound and resilient. Tighter credit conditions for households and businesses are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation.&#8221;</p>
<cite>Stated in FOMC <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230503a.htm" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230503a.htm" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>While the job market has long been a source of data suggesting that interest rate hikes should continue, the market could negatively react to this increase above 5% amidst concerns about inflation and the banking industry.</p>



<p>After the highly anticipated May FOMC meeting, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by another 25 basis points. With attention to whether a continued fight against inflation would commence based on economic data, the market&#8217;s reaction to these rate increases remains to be seen.</p>



<p>Despite the banking crisis in the US, the Federal Reserve is still prioritizing its fight against inflation, despite calls to halt interest rate hikes. This comes as the banking sector faces a crisis, with the US government seizing First Republic Bank, the third bank to meet such a fate.</p>



<p>The Federal Reserve aims to reduce inflation to a 2% target, but doing so has become more complex due to various macroeconomic factors. The Fed is expected to carefully evaluate whether or not to pause interest rate hikes at its next meeting, considering inflation rates, economic growth, and the conditions of the job and housing markets.</p>

<p>Three hours after the spot listing, Binance and Bybit announced the launch of perpetual contracts with leverage up to 50x for the SUI token. This announcement follows a request made by the SUI official team to cooperative exchanges such as Binance, OKX, Bybit, and KuCoin not to launch perpetual contracts when the SUI token is launched. </p>



<p>Likewise, at the launch of APT, the official had also made a similar request not to launch the perpetual contract. However, Binance ignored the request and directly launched perpetual contracts. As a result, other exchanges followed suit and launched futures immediately. This information comes from <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1653723193088311300" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1653723193088311300" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wu&#8217;s reporting</a>.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Exclusive: the SUI official team requires the cooperative exchanges (Binance OKX Bybit KuCoin, etc.) not to launch the perpetual contract when the SUI token is launched.

</div></figure>



<p>While major exchanges have temporarily met this demand, second-tier exchanges such as Gate and MEXC have already launched perpetual contracts.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to note that Binance Futures will launch the USDⓈ-M SUI perpetual contract on May 3, 2023, with leverage up to 50x. The SUIUSDT Perpetual Contract is an exciting opportunity for traders looking to invest in SUI. The contract will be based on the SUI token, with USDT as the settlement asset. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-table aligncenter"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>USDⓈ-M Perpetual Contract</strong></td><td><strong>SUIUSDT</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Launch Time&nbsp;</strong></td><td>2023-05-03 16:00 (UTC)&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Underlying Asset</strong></td><td>SUI</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Settlement Asset</strong></td><td>USDT</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tick Size</strong></td><td>0.0001</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Capped Funding Rate</strong></td><td>Clamp (Funding Rate, -0.75 * Maintenance Margin Ratio, 0.75 * Maintenance Margin Ratio)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Max Leverage</strong></td><td>50x</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Trading Hours</strong></td><td>24/7</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Multi-Assets Mode</strong></td><td>Supported</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Source: Binance</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>It is important to remember that Binance may adjust the specifications of the SUIUSDT Perpetual Contract from time to time based on market risk conditions. This could include changes to the tick size, maximum leverage, initial margin, and/or maintenance margin requirements.</p>

<p>Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, recently participated in a Twitter AMA session where he answered questions about meme coins and token listings. Meme coins have become increasingly popular in cryptocurrency, and CZ&#8217;s comments shed light on how Binance determines which coins to list.</p>



<p>When asked how popular a meme coin needs to be before Binance lists it, CZ mentioned that he never really understood meme coins. However, he explained that the number one criterion for listing a coin on Binance is the number of users trading it, wanting it, playing with it, etc. In other words, user demand is the most important factor when listing a coin on Binance. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;I personally never really understood meme coins. But if a coin has a lot of users trading it, wanting it, playing with it, etc., then we’ll most likely list it.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>CZ also emphasized that Binance has strict policies regarding insider trading accusations, leaks, and other problems. Even if Binance talks with a project team, they forbid them from disclosing anything. CZ deliberately does not get involved in Binance&#8217;s listing process, and an independent team evaluates these things.</p>



<p>Binance listed SHIB, one of the most well-known meme coins, with high trading volume on the platform. This suggests that Binance is not against meme coins or any coin. However, CZ mentioned that if a coin only lasts for two weeks, it probably won&#8217;t be listed.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;We listed SHIB and it&#8217;s actually one of the coins on Binance with higher trading volume. So we&#8217;re not against meme coins.&#8221;</p>
<cite>CZ said</cite></blockquote>

<p>The United Kingdom launched a new fraud strategy, promising 400 new positions to modernize its approach to intelligence-led enforcement. The government will collaborate with the telecommunications regulator, the Office of Communications, or Ofcom, to employ new technology to combat phone number spoofing, which will prevent fraudsters from imitating authentic UK phone numbers.</p>



<p>Fraud is currently the most frequent crime in the UK, affecting one out of every fifteen individuals. By compelling financial institutions to compensate victims of sanctioned fraud, the government hopes to pass legislation that guarantees more victims of fraud get their money back.</p>



<p>The government also promised to prohibit fraudsters from using tactics like SIM farms to contact thousands of people at once and to evaluate the usage of mass-texting services to keep these technologies out of the hands of criminals.</p>



<p>According to a study released on January 29 by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and the Observer, organized crime syndicates are using the United Kingdom as their operating headquarters due to the region&#8217;s lenient legislation.</p>



<p>A company may be registered in the United Kingdom for as low as 12 British pounds. It does not need any sort of identity, making it simple for fake businesses to register and obtain bogus legitimacy.</p>



<p>The government of the United Kingdom has been attempting to crack down on cryptocurrency firms operating in the area. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) of the United Kingdom (UK) has ordered that all entities engaging in crypto asset activity register with it in accordance with the current Financial Services and Markets Act provisions for the digital assets market.</p>



<p>The regulatory issues influencing cryptocurrencies are picking up speed. Includes the European Union, where <a href="https://news.coincu.com/183062-ukraine-to-adopt-new-crypto-law/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MiCA</a> was approved, and the United Kingdom.</p>



<p>In reality, even before leaving the EU, the UK has begun to regulate cryptocurrency. The FCA issued important recommendations in 2019. It underlined that, based on their qualities and intended purpose, cryptocurrencies might be classed as security tokens, e-money tokens, or unregulated tokens.</p>



<p>The FCA, on the other hand, has taken a stringent approach to giving permits, resulting in a number of crypto-related enterprises functioning as unregistered organizations. The regulator seems to be attempting to strike a compromise between ensuring a safe environment for investors and encouraging sector innovation.</p>
