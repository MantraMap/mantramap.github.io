<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ripple-acquires-metaco-250m/">Ripple Acquires Swiss Crypto Custody Platform Metaco for $250M as Part of Push toward Tokenization</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ripple-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ripple</a>¬†has¬†<a href="https://ripple.com/insights/ripple-takes-on-the-crypto-custody-market-with-metaco/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">acquired</a>¬†Swiss-based Metaco for $250 million as part of the remittance network‚Äôs expansion into institutional crypto custody. The acquisition also comes amid a¬†<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ripples-xrp-8-price-pump-court-twist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">favorable ruling</a>¬†for Ripple in its ongoing lawsuit with the Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>).</p>
<p>Ripple‚Äôs acquisition of Metaco underpins the US-based tech platform‚Äôs faith in the tokenization space.¬†<a href="https://decrypt.co/140428/ripple-acquires-crypto-custody-firm-metaco-250m-tokenization-push" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Speaking to Decrypt</a>, Ripple‚Äôs head of custody Sagar Shah predicts that the institutional crypto custody market will hit $10 trillion by 2030. The company‚Äôs Metaco acquisition now sees Ripple prepare for the boom as the sole shareholder of the digital asset custody company. Nonetheless, Metaco would continue operations as an independent brand.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">üì¢ Today, we announce that Metaco becomes part of <a href="https://twitter.com/Ripple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">@Ripple</a>, joining forces in providing exceptional mission-critical software infrastructure solutions that empower institutions to thrive in the rapidly evolving digital asset economy.<br />To learn more: <a href="https://t.co/U68za92n6o" target="_blank">https://t.co/U68za92n6o</a> <a href="https://t.co/scPwNrYfQi" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/scPwNrYfQi</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Metaco (@metaco_sa) <a href="https://twitter.com/metaco_sa/status/1658805134082867201?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">May 17, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Ripple seeks to expand its institutional offerings to customers, using Metaco‚Äôs resources, while the Swiss company expects to benefit from Ripple‚Äôs established customer base.</p>
<h2>Ripple &amp; Metaco CEOs Comment on Acquisition Advantages</h2>
<p>Weighing in on Metaco and the immediate advantages it brings to the table, Ripple chief executive officer Brad Garlinghouse pointed out:</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúMetaco is a proven leader in institutional digital asset custody with an exceptional executive bench and a truly unmatched customer track record. Through the strength of our balance sheet and financial position, Ripple will continue pressing our advantage in the areas critical to crypto infrastructure. Bringing on Metaco is monumental for our growing product suite and expanding global footprint.‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, Metaco founder and CEO Adrien Treccani said Ripple shares his company‚Äôs passion for helping institutions thrive with digital assets. ‚ÄúWe are delighted to join forces with the team at Ripple,‚Äù Treccani gushed, adding that Metaco would leverage the remittance network‚Äôs resources.</p>
<p>The Metaco chief executive pointed out that Ripple‚Äôs scale and market strength would speed up achieving goals. Treccani said Metaco would continue to serve its clients‚Äô institutional demand with &#8220;the utmost excellence in delivery&#8221;.The Swiss company provides institutions with requisite tokenization tools and custody infrastructure to scale new crypto-focused business models. Companies that have used, or are using, Metaco‚Äôs services include <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/citigroup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Citigroup</a>¬†(NYSE: C), Bank BNP Paribas, and Union Bank.</p>
<h2>Future of Digital Assets Is Tokenization</h2>
<p>Ripple views its Metaco acquisition as a long-term play for supremacy in the digital assets space. The currency exchange and remittance network hopes to leverage explosive crypto market growth by combining forces with the Swiss platform. According to Ripple‚Äôs head of custody Sagar Shah, crypto assets under custody could surpass $10 trillion by the decade‚Äôs end. Shah further added that most of these assets would be driven by institutional adoption. In an email to Decrypt, the Ripple executive described the acquisition as a ‚Äúnatural progression‚Äù to servicing customers‚Äô needs. These services include the ability to custody, issue, and settle all tokenized assets while tapping a new revenue stream for the company.</p>
<p>Investment powerhouse¬†<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/blackrock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlackRock</a> also echoed Ripple‚Äôs take on the future of tokenization. Early last December, CEO Larry Fink described the tokenization of securities as the ‚Äúnext generation of markets‚Äù.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Citibank‚Äôs finance executive Ronit Ghose said tokenization could drive up blockchain value immensely by 2030.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/china-prosecution-agency-nft-users/">China&#8217;s Top Prosecution Agency Warns NFT Users of Possible Economic Exploitation via Price Manipulation</a></p>
<p>The Chinese government has pushed the country to digital economy adoption post-Covid-19 global pandemic. The country has significantly rolled out the digital yuan in anticipation to widen the adoption of its currency as a global reserve. The digital Yuan is expected to significantly help improve the overall liquidity of cryptocurrencies in the Asian continent. Moreover, Hong Kong is preparing to adopt crypto-friendly regulations next month, which has significantly attracted Chinese banks to invest in crypto startups.</p>
<h2>China on NFT Market</h2>
<p>According to a theoretical research work published by the Supreme People&#8217;s Procuratorate of the People&#8217;s Republic of China, the NFT market requires proper regulations to ensure safe innovation and ultimate investors‚Äô protection. The blog post titled ‚ÄúThe Legal Attributes and Risk Governance of NFT under the Background of Digital Economy‚Äù recommended risk research and judgment and accurately punishing crimes. Nevertheless, the post pointed out the importance of NFTs in the development of cultural stock resources.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs an application form of NFT, digital collections themselves have virtual asset attributes. Blind and disorderly development can easily lead to illegal fundraising, Multiple risks such as fraud and malicious hype must be paid attention to urgently,‚Äù the post <a href="https://www.spp.gov.cn/spp/llyj/202305/t20230515_614042.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted</a>.</p>
<p>The Chinese prosecutors noted that investors should be wary of NFT projects that hype their projects only to raise money through ICO-like programs. Notably, the Chinese central bank banned ICOs after the Ethereum ICO hype, deeming it an illegal fundraising practice. Over the years, the People‚Äôs Bank of China (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/peoples-bank-of-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PBoC</a>) has issued several bans on crypto exchanges among other related activities in its jurisdictions.</p>
<p>According to Chinese prosecutors, NFT creators hide in plain view through the use of airdrops, blind boxes, limited sales, and synthesis. The authors further added that the NFT&#8217;s initial hype takes advantage of the fact that there is no reasonable pricing mechanism and sufficient value support behind the inflated prices.</p>
<p>With NFT creators able to create a smart contract with rules enabling them to collect taxes per transaction, the Chinese prosecutors noted that most NFT projects evolve into illegal pyramid schemes.</p>
<p>As a result, the prosecutors urged NFT creators to report every financial activity in accordance with the law in order to prevent NFT-related crimes.</p>
<h2>Bigger Picture</h2>
<p>As the infrastructure for NFTs widens with cryptocurrency adoption, countries worldwide are working on formulating related tax frameworks. Moreover, the NFT market is expected to touch many industries including the fashion market, food supply chain, and automotive industries, among others. In this regard, the overall trading volume and market valuation are expected to skyrocket in the coming years.</p>
<p>However, China is yet to overrun its stance on crypto assets despite the increased demand from mainland residents.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/usdt-tether-bitcoin-purchase/">USDT Issuer Tether to Enhance Reserves via Regular Bitcoin Purchase</a></p>
<p>Tether International Limited (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/tether/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tether</a>)¬†seeks to further consolidate its reserves by purchasing Bitcoin (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC</a>) with its operating profits. An¬†<a href="https://tether.to/en/tether-to-further-strengthen-reserves-through-purchase-of-bitcoin-with-realized-net-operating-profits/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">official post</a>¬†states that beginning this month, the stablecoin company will regularly allocate up to 15% of its realized net operating gains toward BTC purchases.</p>
<p>The report also states that Tether does not see current and future BTC holdings in its reserves exceeding the Shareholder Capital Cushion. Thus, the stablecoin issuer seeks to consolidate, grow and diversify its reserves.</p>
<p>In its¬†<a href="https://tether.to/en/tethers-latest-q1-2023-assurance-report-shows-reserves-surplus-at-all-time-high-of-244b-up-148b-in-net-profit-new-categories-for-additional-transparency-reveals-bitcoin-and-gold-allocations/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">first-quarter Assurance Report</a>, Tether revealed that its reserves held roughly $1.5 billion in BTC as of the end of March. The company also said it holds the private keys linked to all of its Bitcoin holdings.</p>
<h2>Tether CTO Expounds on Bitcoin Purchase Scheme</h2>
<p>Speaking on Tether&#8217;s decision to purchase Bitcoin with the platform&#8217;s surplus funds, chief technical officer Paolo Ardoino explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The decision to invest in Bitcoin, the world&#8217;s first and largest cryptocurrency, is underpinned by its strength and potential as an investment asset. Bitcoin has continually proven its resilience and has emerged as a long-term store of value with substantial growth potential.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Ardoino added:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;[Bitcoin&#8217;s] limited supply, decentralized nature, and widespread adoption have positioned Bitcoin as a favored choice among institutional and retail investors alike.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Tether CTO further said the company&#8217;s Bitcoin investment does not only improve its portfolio but aligns the stablecoin issuer with a &#8220;transformative technology&#8221;. Ardoino believes this revolutionary technology could potentially restructure &#8220;the way we conduct business and live our lives&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Tether company said BTC&#8217;s sustained impressive track record underscores the leading digital currency&#8217;s investment potential. Furthermore, the company noted that the crypto&#8217;s increasing mainstream recognition has solidified its status as an essential component in diversified investment portfolios.</p>
<p>Tether will focus exclusively on deploying investment strategy realized profits to fuel its Bitcoin-investing agenda. By subsequently disregarding price-induced unrealized capital gains, the company considers only tangible operational gains.</p>
<p>Tether&#8217;s planned BTC purchases are part of a broader conservative and informed approach to investment decisions. Furthermore, by routinely shoring up on Bitcoin, the stablecoin issuer seeks to reflect transparency and capital allocation strategy clarity.</p>
<h2>Q1 2023 Assurance Report</h2>
<p>On Wednesday, May 10th, Tether&#8217;s published Assurance Report showed a reserve surplus at a record high of $2.44 billion. Furthermore, the company reported an increase of $1.4 billion in net profit for the first three months of the year.</p>
<p>Tether closed the first quarter with $81.8 billion in consolidated total assets, with most of its investments remaining highly liquid.</p>
<p>Ardoino expressed pleasure at the company&#8217;s overall Q1 2023 performance and said Tether&#8217;s Q2 outlook was positive. The CTO added that the stablecoin issuer would monitor asset risk-adjusted returns on an ongoing basis and tweak accordingly. Ardoino also reassured customers that Tether would not expose their funds to high-risk scenarios amid an uncertain global economy. The company seeks to double down on what worked well in the first quarter while also exploring other prime opportunities in the digital asset space.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/telegram-security-macos-camera/">Telegram Defends Its Security Architecture amid macOS Camera Exploit Risk</a></p>
<p>Popular messaging app <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/telegram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Telegram</a> has addressed a recent camera and security exploit that could allow attackers to gain control of a macOS device‚Äôs camera. A spokesperson for Telegram Remi Vaughn mentioned that Telegram users are not at risk by default because the exploit requires malware to be installed on the system.</p>
<p>Notably, Software engineer Dan Revah drew attention to this exploit in a <a href="https://danrevah.github.io/2023/05/15/CVE-2023-26818-Bypass-TCC-with-Telegram/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a> on May 15. In the post, Revah claimed to have gained local privilege escalation beyond what was previously provided to the installed Telegram program, allowing macOS users&#8217; webcams to be attacked.</p>
<p>According to the Software Engineer, exploitation of this vulnerability allows the recording and saving of files from the device&#8217;s camera by injecting a dynamic library into the user&#8217;s system. Revah also claims the exploit allows attackers to bypass the device&#8217;s sandbox using launch agents.</p>
<p>In his opinion, an attacker might possibly get more system rights by gaining access to restricted privacy zones. However, Vaughn revealed that Telegram made the improvements that were accepted by the Apple App Store in late May. ‚ÄúUsers who downloaded the Telegram app directly from the messaging app&#8217;s website are not at risk,‚Äù he noted.</p>
<p>Notably, the steady increase in <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/ultimate-guide-to-blockchain-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cyber-attacks</a> observed in the Blockchain ecosystem may have raised concerns for Revah. Over the years, the industry has seen continued growth in cyberattack rates, causing people to worry about security levels with each new blockchain breakthrough.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, crypto attacks have <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/japan-north-korean-crypto-hacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resulted</a> in losses of at least $721 million in Japan alone, accounting for more than 30% of the more than $2.3 billion lost in cryptocurrency hacks worldwide.</p>
<h2>Telegram Makes Efforts towards Increasing Security Features</h2>
<p>Telegram has implemented various security features to enhance user privacy and data protection. In December, the messaging app released a new version that allows users to create accounts using blockchain-based anonymous numbers instead of mobile phone numbers.</p>
<p>Through the upgrade, users will be allowed to hide numbers from everyone, which is sure to gratify those who value privacy-focused services. To take advantage of this feature, users will need to purchase a blockchain-based anonymous number from the decentralized auction platform Fragment.</p>
<p>Additionally, Telegram has a bug bounty program that encourages security researchers to submit any vulnerabilities or security issues they find. This program encourages responsible vulnerability disclosure and aids Telegram in improving its security architecture.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Telegram‚Äôs founder Pavel Durov has also suggested that the platform would build a variety of decentralized tools and services following the collapse of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/sam-bankman-fried/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sam Bankman Fried</a>&#8216;s FTX cryptocurrency exchange.</p>
<p>Remarkably, the platform has <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/telegram-premium-700-million-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> 700 million active users, a significant milestone that marks the growing popularity of free social media apps. The platform claims the milestone was driven by personal recommendations since it does not have an ad campaign to promote its app.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ripples-xrp-8-price-pump-court-twist/">Ripple‚Äôs XRP Experiences 8% Price Pump Following Latest Court Twist</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ripple-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ripple</a>¬†native token¬†<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XRP</a> recently experienced an 8% price pump following a seemingly ‚Äòfavorable‚Äô court ruling. The digital currency‚Äôs jump came after the presiding judge in the long-drawn-out Ripple vs <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a> case denied a motion filed by the regulator.</p>
<p>Ripple‚Äôs XRP traded at 46 US cents at 12:45 pm Singapore time Wednesday. Furthermore, XRP‚Äôs recent price upswing marks the crypto‚Äôs highest climb in seven weeks. This is likely because investors interpreted Judge Analisa Torres‚Äô ruling as favorable for Ripple.</p>
<p>XRP remains the sixth-largest digital currency in the world, with a market capitalization of approximately $24 billion.</p>
<h2>Events Leading Up to XRP Price Pump</h2>
<p>Yesterday, District Judge Torres rejected the¬†Securities and Exchange Commission‚Äôs¬†motion to seal the entire William Hinman documents. The District Court judge ruled that the documents regarding a June 2018 speech by the former SEC director are ‚Äúrelevant to the performance of the judicial function.‚Äù However, Judge Torres said she would allow the SEC to redact personal information mentioned in the documents.</p>
<p>The US District Court for the Southern District of New York judge‚Äôs ruling referenced a similar ruling by a magistrate judge in the same court. In January last year, Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn first ruled that the Hinman Speech Documents be turned over to Ripple as part of the ongoing case. Presently, Judge Torres wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúAs Judge Netburn found in her order dated January 13, 2022, the Hinman Speech Documents are not protected by the deliberative process privilege because they do not relate to an agency position, decision, or policy. Therefore, sealing these documents would not be related to preserving ‚Äòopenness and candor‚Äô within the agency, nor would such an interest be substantial enough to outweigh the strong presumption of public access.‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>The Hinman documents refer to the former SEC Corporation Finance Director‚Äôs 2018 speech on crypto and securities to Ripple. At the time, Hinman described Ether (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ETH</a>) as a non-security and, therefore, not liable to be sealed in a court order. Hinman also added that Bitcoin (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC</a>) was ‚Äúdecentralized‚Äù (and thus, not a security). However, Hinman‚Äôs assessment went against statute standards that define securities.</p>
<h2>SEC Case against Ripple Believed to Be Compromised by District Court Ruling</h2>
<p>With Hinman‚Äôs previous stance in mind, Judge Torres‚Äôs ruling is a blow to the SEC‚Äôs protracted lawsuit against Ripple. Conversely, the ruling development could swing the tide in the remittance network‚Äôs favor as CEO¬†<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/brad-garlinghouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brad Garlinghouse</a>¬†looks forward to a conclusion. Garlinghouse recently¬†<a href="https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1658539290182430720" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a> about the SEC‚Äôs double standards regarding crypto designation. Furthermore, the CEO added that the securities regulator‚Äôs lack of clarity is hampering the crypto industry‚Äôs growth. Garlinghouse‚Äôs thread also echoed other crypto leaders‚Äô sentiments that the SEC is having its way via enforcement actions. He believes all actions should follow established rules instead.</p>
<p>In 2020, the SEC sued Ripple for failing to register XRP as a security. The regulator has long held onto its belief that most tokens are securities and thus fall under the same regulatory purview. Meanwhile, observers widely believe that the eventual outcome of the Ripple vs SEC case would have far-reaching implications for the US digital asset space.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/tencent-q1-2023-earnings/">Tencent Q1 2023 Earnings Statement Rides High on Increased Payment Volumes, Ad Sales, Gaming</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tencent Holdings</a>¬†posted its Q1 2023 results, reflecting the company‚Äôs fastest jump in quarterly revenue in over a year. The latest quarterly figures also mark a resounding rebound for the Chinese tech giant following a series of underwhelmingly flat quarters.</p>
<p>For Q1 2023, Tencent posted an 11% year-over-year revenue jump to 150 billion Chinese yuan ($21.4 billion) compared to analysts‚Äô expectations of 146.09 billion yuan. The Shenzhen-based tech and entertainment conglomerate attributed the income increase to a boost in payment volumes, ad sales, and gaming. The rebound was part of a broader sound recovery in China‚Äôs domestic consumption, with the country easing its harsh Covid restrictions last December.</p>
<p>In its Wednesday report, Tencent said that net profit grew faster for the quarter. This development reflected a ‚Äúpositive revenue mix shift, operational efficiencies, and an easy base period‚Äù. The company‚Äôs profit attributable to equity holders came in at 25.8 billion yuan, representing a 10% climb YoY. However, analysts had expected a profit attributable to company equity holders‚Äô figure of 31 billion yuan.</p>
<p>Investors anticipated that China‚Äôs economic reopening would boost local tech mainstays such as Tencent, and they were not disappointed. Tencent reported that a return to growth in domestic game sales helped its gaming business, as the Chinese economy grew 4.5% in Q1.</p>
<p>Tencent said that its popular local Honor of Kings game experienced record-high numbers in the year‚Äôs first quarter. In addition, other games like CrossFire PC and CrossFire Mobile benefitted from promotions featuring additional in-game content.</p>
<h2>Tencent Q1 2023 Performance Marks Substantial Improvement from China‚Äôs 2020/21 Restrictive Regulatory Era</h2>
<p>Tencent‚Äôs Q1 tech success is a far cry from late 2020 when the Chinese government imposed stricter regulations on the tech industry. At the time, Beijing embarked on a sweeping crackdown on companies, including¬†<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/alibaba-group/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alibaba</a>, JD.com, and Tencent. The government‚Äôs regulatory tightening impacted several tech bottom lines and wiped off a combined $1 trillion in value.</p>
<p>In 2021, Chinese regulators suspended new video game releases and imposed strict measures on usage among young children. However, in the last few months, Beijing has softened its stance on the industry and approved more titles for release.</p>
<p>At the height of the Chinese government‚Äôs grip on the local gaming and tech industry, Tencent increased its focus on international markets. The multinational holding company‚Äôs international gaming division experienced solid growth, with some titles seeing YoY growth of 30%.</p>
<p>Many expect artificial intelligence to command a decent amount of attention at Tencent‚Äôs upcoming earnings call. The reason is that AI is a globally-recognized emerging market that promises to be the next lucrative venture. Several companies in Asia, Europe, and America have embarked on AI schemes, and observers expect these offerings to intensify in the coming months.</p>
<p>In its earnings statement, Tencent explained it was investing in artificial intelligence capabilities and cloud infrastructure to meet posed opportunities. The company added that AI ‚Äú[could] be a growth multiplier that enables us to better serve our users, customers, and society at large‚Äù.</p>
<p>Tencent‚Äôs executives are slated to speak with investors later today.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/startup-river-35m-series-b-funding/">Bitcoin Startup River Raises $35 Million in Series B Funding Round</a></p>
<p>River, a <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> technology and financial services startup, has completed a $35 million Series B funding round. This follows after its $12 million Series A round in 2021.</p>
<p>The new round was led by Kingsway Capital and also saw participation from contributors such as Alarko Ventures, Valor Equity Partners, Goldcrest, Cygni, and M13 among others.</p>
<p>Billionaire investor Peter Thiel also backed the investment round as River continues to aim at creating a robust financial system with Bitcoin.</p>
<p>To this end, a company press release quotes River CEO Alex Leishman as <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/05/16/peter-thiel-backs-bitcoin-startup-river-in-35m-round/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">saying</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This funding round demonstrates our commitment to championing an honest and robust financial environment through the use of bitcoin &#8211; the world&#8217;s only incorruptible digital currency.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Bitcoin Startup River to Use Funding to Boost Lightning Transactions</h2>
<p>Primarily, River offers a range of Bitcoin-focused services, including mining, brokerage, wallet services, and full-reserve custody.</p>
<p>However, now more than ever, there&#8217;s a growing demand for Bitcoin from private individuals and business entities alike. Due to the recent failures and flaws of the traditional banking system, Bitcoin‚Äôs potential to foster a more secure global economy may have come to light in a new way.</p>
<p>But then, with on-chain fees for Bitcoin payments and settlements also rising, users are increasingly demanding Lightning transactions. In line with this demand, the firm launched the River Lightning application programming interface (API) in October. That was to help companies easily integrate their applications with the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-lightning-network-and-how-does-it-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lightning Network</a>.</p>
<p>So, River will be looking to use the major part of the new funding to enhance its B2B River Lightning segment. This is in line with its ever-present aspiration to become the industry‚Äôs go-to platform for Bitcoin payments.</p>
<p>Ultimately, River aims to provide the easiest on-ramp to invest in Bitcoin for an average person as they look for an alternative to the current failing system.</p>

<p>Makers of Axie Infinity are hopeful that launching the game on the Apple platform will spurt growth. They are also hopeful of Apple making policies friendlier for NFTs in the future. </p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/apple-axie-infinity-game-app-store/">Apple Allows Axie Infinity Game to Feature on App Store</a></p>
<p>In the latest development, Sky Mavis, the creator of the popular blockchain-enabled Axie Infinity video game, announced that the video game will be now available for download on the Apple App Store.</p>
<p>Axie Infinity is a play-to-earn crypto game that allows gamers to battle one another while collecting or trading earning rewards as well as non-fungible tokens (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFTs</a>). The latest step will allow Axie Infinity to regain many of the customers that it lost during the crypto winter of 2022.</p>
<p>Last year, Sky Mavis launched the latest version of the game dubbed &#8216;Axie Infinity: Origins&#8217;. As of now, the company plans to launch the game in a select number of countries within South East Asia as well as Latin America. Jeffrey Zirlin, the co-founder of Sky Mavis believes that the limited rollout will help the company ‚Äúgather data around retention rates‚Äù before an eventual global launch.</p>
<p>Sky Mavis said that some of the countries where Apple users will be able to download this game include Argentina, Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, Mexico, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Malaysia. Zirlin added that the company has been working with Apple for over a year to gain approval for the launch of &#8216;Axie Infinity: Origins&#8217; on the App Store.</p>
<p>This is a major milestone considering that <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/apple-inc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple</a> has historically made it difficult for crypto players to establish a base on its platform.</p>
<h2>Hope that Apple Allows the Trading of NFTs</h2>
<p>For blockchain-based Web3 gaming platforms, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) play a crucial role as in-game assets and see a high activity of trading. However, as we know, Apple has made it extremely difficult for users of their smartphone applications to buy, sell and trade NFTs.</p>
<p>But Sky Mavis executive Zirlin is optimistic that Apple&#8217;s policies will eventually evolve in favor of Web3 companies. He <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/231119/axie-infinity-origins-crypto-game-apple-app-store?utm_source=news.xml&amp;utm_medium=rss" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúWe are hopeful around adding in-app purchases for NFTs and Apple allowing for the linking to third-party marketplaces. We expect there to be progress in the future.‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple&#8217;s hefty 30% tax on in-app sales and restrictions over the purchase of digital assets like NFTs have stifled the adoption of certain blockchain-enabled applications. ‚ÄúThat is definitely one of the variables that makes things hard,‚Äù said Zirlin. ‚ÄúBut I do know that there are larger players than us fighting that fight. For example, Epic Games.‚Äù</p>
<p>But Zirlin is hopeful of gaining growth momentum once iPhone users download the game. He said: ‚ÄúSeventy percent of our users come from family and friend referrals. So actually being on the App Store‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs really important for our growth machine.‚Äù</p>
<p>&#8216;Axie Infinity: Origins&#8217; is the ‚Äúmost-played web3 game right now‚Äù having more than 1.5 million downloads. No other player in the Web3 video games space has managed to achieve any closer success as achieved by Axie Infinity. As per the data from CryptoSlam, Axie NFTs clocked $2.3 million in trading on less than 140,000 transactions.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ubs-record-17b-loss-credit-suisse/">Swiss Banking Giant UBS May Record $17B Loss from Credit Suisse Takeover</a></p>
<p>Swiss multinational banking giant <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ubs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UBS Group AG</a> (SWX: UBSG) has revealed new details about what its liabilities are likely to be from the acquisition of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/credit-suisse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Credit Suisse Group AG</a> (SWX: CSGN). According to a CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/17/ubs-expects-17-billion-hit-from-credit-suisse-rescue-flags-hasty-due-diligence.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a> based on the filing, the firm lodged with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>), a total financial hit of $17 billion may be incurred from the forced takeover.</p>
<p>In its exact description, it is set to take on a total of $13 billion liability in fair value adjustments for the rebranded mega financial firm. The remaining $4 billion cost will be tapped from legal and regulatory costs.</p>
<p>The company revealed that the expedited nature of the acquisition made it conduct its due diligence on the company in a very hurried manner. Credit Suisse has been experiencing trouble in its finances for quite some time, however, its woes and subsequent bank runs reached its peak in March after which the Swiss regulator took it into its hands to broker a deal to prevent the ripple effect of what it termed an imminent collapse.</p>
<p>With just a few days given by FINMA for the company to conduct its due diligence, it revealed in its F-4 filing with the SEC that it might have assumed more liabilities than envisaged.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf the circumstances of the due diligence affected UBS Group AG‚Äôs ability to thoroughly consider Credit Suisse‚Äôs liabilities and weaknesses, it is possible that UBS Group AG will have agreed to a rescue that is considerably more difficult and risky than it had contemplated,‚Äù UBS said in the Risk Factors section of the filing.</p>
<p>Agreeing to complete the acquisition implies UBS must have seen at least a positive prospect in the embattled rival in the long term.</p>
<h2>UBS to Implement Phased Integration of Credit Suisse</h2>
<p>According to the UBS post-acquisition plans, it is going to implement a phased integration of the Credit Suisse brand which may last a couple of years.</p>
<p>While the worry of the $17 billion deficit appears high at this time, the company is also looking at ways to offset this huge deficit. Per the CNBC report, one of its prominent options is the ‚Äúone-off $34.8 billion gain from so-called ‚Äúnegative goodwill‚Äù, which refers to the acquisition of assets at a much lower cost than their true worth.‚Äù</p>
<p>UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti has revealed earlier that the acquisition of Credit Suisse will stir profit in the long run. The company is now being very strategic in how the acquired entity is managed and one of its strategies is to integrate top executives of Credit Suisse into the transition.</p>
<p>As such, it <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ubs-credit-suisse-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Credit Suisse CEO Ulrich Koerner will join the executive board of the new entity last week, a move that has been applauded by experts across the board.</p>

<p>Crypto exchange <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase</a> is looking into <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/231030/coinbase-singapore-services" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">relocating</a> to Singapore as the United States Securities and Exchange Commission rejects the company&#8217;s requests for regulatory clarity.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US SEC</a> recently asked the judge to deny Coinbase&#8217;s bid to coerce the agency to answer Coinbase&#8217;s rulemaking petition. The petition was submitted last year asking for clarity on how securities laws applied to cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Last month, Coinbase filed a lawsuit against SEC asserting that the agency was neither quick nor logical in offering a response to its petition. Moreover, the exchange is looking for an official notice-and-comment procedure that would enable the public to participate.</p>
<p>Coinbase CEO <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/brian-armstrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brian Armstrong</a> is considering migrating offshore owing to a lack of clarity on crypto mandates in the United States. The firm is exploring options in the Bahamas, The United Arab Emirates, and Europe as suggested locations for its headquarters.</p>
<p>Since the firm is experiencing trouble, it is now looking towards powering its global expansion strategy as an answer to the crypto crackdown by regulatory officials in the United States. The firm recently introduced Coinbase International Exchange in the Bahamas to roll out derivatives trading and is also exploring UAE as a possible strategic center.</p>
<p>Coinbase has already secured a digital payment token services license from Singapore central bank last year in October. The approval would allow Coinbase to offer payment services to Singapore users. Ever since the approval, the exchange has been rolling out several products and services for its Singapore users.</p>
<p>The firm also conducted a survey recently to asses the constructive stance of policymakers towards crypto and Web3 in Singapore. The survey disclosed that almost 25% of Singaporeans consider crypto as the future of finance. The study also showed that people with high incomes were more likely to engage in trading in the virtual space.</p>
<p>Along with the results from the survey, the firm also announced <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/usd-coin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USDC</a> updates. The firm introduced no-fee USDC purchases with Singapore dollar (SGD), rewards for holding USDC on the platform, and making USDC order books available on advanced trading.</p>
<p>Recently in March, Coinbase announced free bank transfers and Singpass integration to make it convenient for clients in Singapore to enter the platform. The exchange also revamped its Help Centre and Coinbase Learning to look into queries and educate about the crypto economy, which will allow users to avail more than 200 crypto assets for trading.</p>
<p>Coinbase has also formed a strategic banking collaboration with Standard Chartered and allows Singapore citizens to exchange money to and from their accounts using any Singaporean bank for free.</p>
