<p>Crypto billionaires Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss cautioned the Democratic Party that its &ldquo;war on crypto&rdquo; will result in its losing crucial voters. </p>
<p>According to the Winklevoss twins, US President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party risk losing crucial voters if it continues its &ldquo;war on crypto.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cameron Winklevoss, who founded crypto exchange Gemini with his brother Tyler, recently tweeted to warn democrats that they will &ldquo;alienate an entire generation&rdquo; of youth voters should it continue with its anti-crypto attitude.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The @SenWarren and @GaryGensler war against crypto is going to alienate an entire generation of would-be Democrats.Winning the youth vote w/ "get out the vote" is key part of Dem playbook. Dems believe the youth vote will carry the day. pic.twitter.com/F4FQowjCVn</p>

<p>Winklevoss called out SEC Chairman Gary Gensler and Senator Elizabeth Warren in his tweet.</p>
<p>He added:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Crypto has already won the hearts and minds of Millennials and GenZ. They don&rsquo;t debate the merits of crypto.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyler Winklevoss followed up the next day with a tweet saying:</p>

<p>Roe cost Republicans the mid-terms. The @SenWarren and @GaryGensler war on crypto will cost Dems the 2024 election.</p>

<p>The Winklevoss twins&rsquo; statements come amid aggressive action from the SEC, led by Gensler. The agency famously sued crypto exchange Binance and rival exchange Coinbase for alleged securities violations.</p>
<p>Senator Warren also made headlines for cultivating an anti-crypto coalition under US politicians.</p>
<p>The Gemini co-founder further offered two explanations for the recent enforcement:</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Two explanations: (1) blue establishment either doesn't understand what's going on w/ Warren and Gensler or (2) are grossly miscalculating impact of their actions on youth vote this upcoming election cycle.They may not care about crypto, but they will care about the lost votes.</p>
