<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Authorities in Italy and Albania have taken down an online investment fraud involving the use of cryptocurrency with the assistance of Eurojust, the cross-border agency of the European Union, for countering organized crime.</em></li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><em>By letting the victims obtain an immediate financial return in exchange for a little initial investment, the offenders won the victims&#8217; trust.</em></li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><em>A united investigation team&#8217;s activity resulted in the seizure of assets worth 3 million euros, Eurojust reported on December 19. Additionally, more than 160 electronic items, including laptops, servers, digital video recorders, and cell phones, were seized.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>An alleged crypto scam scheme that netted 15 million euros has been <a href="https://www.eurojust.europa.eu/news/takedown-online-investment-fraud-responsible-losses-eur-15-million" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exposed</a> by law enforcement in Italy and Albania.</strong></h5>

<p>The inquiry determined that an<strong> organized crime gang (OCG)</strong> operating out of a contact center in <strong>Tirana, Albania,</strong> was responsible for the investment fraud. The suspects allegedly used delocalized virtual private networks and anonymous <strong>virtual phone numbers (VPNs) </strong>to call the victims.</p>



<p>According to an announcement made on <strong>December 19</strong> by <strong>Eurojust</strong>, the European Union&#8217;s transnational organization for combating organized crime, assets worth 3 million euros were recovered during the operation. Additionally, more than <strong>160 electronic items</strong>, including<strong> laptops, servers, digital video recorders</strong>, and<strong> cell phones</strong>, were seized.</p>



<p>Victims were requested to open an account and transfer a small amount of money, demonstrating a quick financial gain. Then, despite it being unclear whether any crypto assets were bought, they were approached by scammers acting as brokers that recommended favorable investments in cryptocurrencies with minimal risk.</p>

<p>According to <strong>Eurojust</strong>, victims were then pushed to make much greater investments—in some cases, their whole financial resources. The account information was updated, and the victims were locked out once the larger deposits had been made.</p>



<p>Criminals have found success with cryptocurrency investment schemes, which prey on people looking to make substantial short-term financial gains.</p>



<p>According to police data, crypto fraud <a href="https://news.coincu.com/146983-uk-crypto-fraud-rose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surged</a> by a third in the <strong>UK</strong> in a single year, with thieves stealing hundreds of millions of pounds from victims.</p>

<p>The total value of the purchase is roughly<strong> $53 million</strong>, and both <a href="https://news.coincu.com/128585-sbi-holdings-ceo-co-signed-ripple-i-remit/"><strong>SBI </strong></a>and <strong>Square Enix</strong> intend to make substantial strides in the crypto and blockchain gaming market as a result. According to a news release, SBI planned to combine <strong>Gumi&#8217;s game development </strong>and operational know-how with its own token listing expertise. Both exchanges are owned by SBI. The company further stated that it would use <strong>SBI NFT</strong> as <strong>a secondary distribution market </strong>for NFTs obtained from <strong>Gumi-created games</strong>.</p>



<p>The Tokyo-based gaming company<strong> Gumi</strong> announced the agreement in a press release, detailing how the acquisition would make SBI the company&#8217;s largest stakeholder with <strong>22.46% of the company&#8217;s voting rights</strong>. Due to their investment,<strong> Square Enix</strong> now owns <strong>3.01%</strong> of the company. Among Square Enix&#8217;s many accomplishments are the video game series Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest.</p>

<p>Square Enix predicted earlier this year that it would &#8220;<strong>not be enough</strong>&#8221; to continue putting its emphasis on traditional gaming to ensure its future success. User-generated content like <strong>non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and play-to-earn crypto games </strong>were mentioned as potential additions to the company&#8217;s future revenue models. Gumi could be Square Enix&#8217;s first hesitant step into space.</p>



<p>A &#8220;<strong>platform dedicated to blockchain games</strong>&#8221; is something that SBI is &#8220;thinking&#8221; launching. It claimed that through &#8220;<strong>collaboration</strong>,&#8221; it could build a one-stop solution in the gaming industry, wherein blockchain games could be created, distributed, and sold, in addition to new forms of digital currency.</p>

<p>The <strong>Commercial Crime Bureau of the Police </strong>held a press conference today on the arrest of a fraud case involving a cryptocurrency trading platform. It is reported that the trading platform involved the Hong Kong crypto exchange <a href="https://news.coincu.com/147946-aax-rug-pull-plan-relationship-aax/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AAX</a>.</p>

<p>During the press briefing, <strong>Kung Hing-fun</strong>, a member of the Commercial Crime Bureau&#8217;s Fraud division, remarked:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Through false information, news, and illegal means, the trading platform stopped operating, so investors have failed to get back their virtual assets.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>Kung</strong> noted that the current investigation might lead to additional arrests.</p>



<p>Authorities claim that before the exchange&#8217;s senior management left <strong>Hong Kong</strong> with the company&#8217;s cryptocurrency wallets and secret keys,<strong> </strong>it<strong> </strong>suspended user withdrawals for <strong>&#8220;fault and maintenance.&#8221;</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://news.coincu.com/154618-ftx-seeks-help-ownership-robinhood-shares/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX</a>, the world’s second-largest virtual currency trading platform, filed for bankruptcy protection, triggering a wave of closures.</p>



<p>As Coincu <a href="https://news.coincu.com/147611-disclosure-aax-wallet-addresses-related/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, AAX suddenly closed down in the middle of last month, high-level executives jumped ship, employees were dismissed, investors were unable to withdraw assets, and there were thousands of people in the online suffering group. Some claimed that the loss exceeded one million yuan, and it is estimated that <strong>the total amount involved exceeded 100 million yuan.</strong></p>

<p>This is the season for our newly created <a href="https://news.coincu.com/153935-metamask-support-for-optimism-arbitrum/"><strong>MetaMask</strong></a> Grants to make their first awards. DAO is an<strong> employee-led program</strong> that awards funds to developers who are creating meaningful experiences inside the <strong>MetaMask ecosystem</strong>. The company chose <strong>Agoric</strong> and <strong>Safeheron</strong> as the initial winners.</p>



<p>Agoric will use the <strong>$500,000 funding</strong> to continue building <strong>a variety of open source technologies</strong> that will serve as a bridge between security and a fun, fast-paced ecosystem.</p>



<p>Agoric and MetaMask have a long history, with the former providing tools and mentoring aimed at: keeping users secure, and enabling new and exciting extensibility.</p>



<p>The platform discovered the possibility to accomplish extraordinary supply chain security with programs like <strong>LavaMoat</strong> by integrating <strong>Agoric&#8217;s tools</strong>, and with <strong>Hardened JS</strong> (previously &#8220;Secure EcmaScript&#8221;), they have been pioneering what it means to add new services to the wallet at runtime through<strong> Snaps</strong>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;We are building a user-centric consent system, and I believe our work with Agoric will allow us to build a safer platform that empowers users to do more interesting things, enabling not only the composition of dynamic and resilient software but also extending into the social fabric,&#8221;</p>

<p>A <strong>$35,000 award</strong> will be used by <strong>Safeheron</strong> to create and <strong>security audit </strong>a key sharding solution for The Flask, Keystone hardware wallets, and mobile apps ( Mobile or alternatives).</p>



<p>Safeheron and MetaMask are continuing their work to <strong>improve MetaMask users&#8217; security and usability</strong>. This project will focus on improving <strong>MetaMask&#8217;s key management experience</strong>, focusing on: assisting users in managing their Secret Recovery Phrase (SRP) to decrease phishing assaults and minimizing the likelihood of keys being lost.</p>

<p>As Coincu <a href="https://news.coincu.com/142549-paxos-freezes-19m-in-crypto/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/142549-paxos-freezes-19m-in-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported </a>on November 15, <strong>Paxos said that U.S. federal authorities had ordered the company to freeze $19 million in bitcoin linked to the insolvent FTX exchange</strong>. Over 24 hours on the day, the tokens had been transferred from FTX.com to unidentified wallet addresses. </p>



<p>Soon after Sam Bankman-Fried sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last month, their failing exchange was taken advantage of to the tune of <strong>$400 million</strong>. The Paxos Gold (PAXG) tokens, which are backed by actual gold held by the firm, were among the stolen goods. </p>



<p>In four wallets under the hands of hackers, the firm swiftly frozen <strong>11,184 Paxos Gold (PAXG) tokens worth $20 million</strong>. The team has now completely regained the assets, roughly six weeks.</p>



<p>Security company PeckShield discovered based on on-chain data that Paxos took action yesterday to relocate the stolen tokens from addresses designated as &#8220;FTX Accounts Drainer&#8221; by Etherscan to a null address and burn them. It then completed the reclamation process by minting the identical amount into another wallet.</p>

<p>The Paxos recovery, however, only accounts for a minor percentage of the robbery. <strong>The FTX reserves&#8217; ether holdings were $302 million at one time in the FTX drainer wallet</strong>, but virtually all of that money was lost when it was exchanged for bitcoin and could not be recouped.</p>



<p>John Ray III, the new CEO of FTX, stated in prepared testimony that FTX had very lax security measures in place and was storing private keys to its wallets in an unencrypted way, all of which might have made it very easy for the breach to occur.</p>

<p>Deeper investigations into the digital assets of the anti-theft company have shown that scammers have been stealing millions in cryptocurrency and NFTs by taking advantage of the OpenSea gasless platform&#8217;s vulnerability.</p>



<p>Many users are drawn to execute gasless transactions within the <strong>OpenSea</strong> platform, which needs users to approve their signatures with an unintelligible message, claims the <strong>Harpie</strong> security firm.</p>



<p>Additionally, users can construct private activities with unintelligible signatures using the <strong>OpenSea</strong> <strong>gasless</strong> <strong>functionality</strong>. As a result, con artists have begun requesting people to sign one of their illegible letters using this technology.</p>

<p>The login messages are signature requests to execute a private sale of the victim&#8217;s NFT to the con artist for <strong>0 Ether</strong>, it&#8217;s important to note. Hackers are now able to siphon funds from the victim if they sign.</p>



<p>In addition to this fraud, the blockchain security firm <strong>CertiK</strong> recently warned the cryptocurrency community about a practice they call <strong>&#8220;ice phishing.&#8221;</strong> By using this exploit, con artists get <strong>Web3</strong> users to sign permissions that give the attackers the right to use their tokens. The scam, according to <strong>CertiK</strong>, is specific to the <strong>Web3</strong> industry and poses a serious threat.</p>

<p>As Coincu <a href="https://news.coincu.com/152966-bayc-scammers-spend-4-months/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, on <strong>December 17</strong>, an analyst pointed out how a con artist allegedly stole<strong> 14 Bored Ape NFTs </strong>using the gasless <strong>Seaport</strong> signature feature. The hacker conducted extensive social engineering before leading the victim to a phony NFT site and having the holder sign a contract. The victim&#8217;s wallet was then stolen after that.</p>

<p>In two transactions, the previous <strong>BNB Chain hacker</strong> transferred around <strong>26 million USDC for ETH</strong>. These are massive transactions that have created arbitrage space. As a result, in this block, a<strong> MEV robot</strong> bribed package validators with <strong>43.14 ETH</strong> to achieve backrun.</p>

<p>This is the next hack action reported at BNB Chain. Previously, on <a href="https://news.coincu.com/131843-bnb-chain-bridge-hacker-transfers-33772-eth/"><strong>October 9</strong></a>, BNB Chain hackers breached the BNB Chain and grabbed possession of around <strong>2 million BNB tokens</strong>. More than<strong> 586 million dollars</strong>&#8216; worth of currency can be represented by these tokens.</p>



<p>According to the data provided by PeckSheild, an amount equal to<strong> $89.5 million </strong>has been removed from the system that <a href="https://news.coincu.com/134827-1m-of-bitkeep-crypto-wallet-hacked/">BNB Chain</a> uses. <strong>58% of total amount</strong> was allocated to the <strong>Ethereum</strong> network, <strong>33%</strong> to the <strong>Fantom</strong> network, and<strong> 4.5% to Arbitrum</strong>.</p>



<p>There was an exploit in the cross-chain bridge operation between <strong>BNB Beacon Chain (BEP2) and BNB Smart Chain</strong>, according to BNB Chain (BEP20 or BSC). By exploiting that weakness, the hacker was able to withdraw a total of 2 million BNB.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>In 2023, the Argentine province of Buenos Aires will start taxing crypto mining and perhaps staking.</em></li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><em>An updated proposal would change the tax code to include cryptocurrency mining as a taxable activity and impose a 4% tax on any revenue derived from such operations. The question of whether staking will be taxed is still open.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>The Buenos Aires province in Argentina gave the go-ahead for a plan to include crypto mining as a taxable activity for the upcoming calendar year.</strong></h5>

<p>According to a paper <a href="https://intranet.hcdiputados-ba.gov.ar/proyectos/22-23PE10012022-10-3111-45-23.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">submitted</a> by the province&#8217;s governor, <strong>Alex Kicillof</strong>, <strong>4% of the revenue generated by the activity</strong>, officially referred to as<strong> &#8220;Processing and validation services for crypto assets and/or cryptocurrency transactions (crypto asset and/or cryptocurrency mining),”</strong> will be required.</p>



<p>Argentine accountant <strong>Marcos Zocaro </strong>is uncertain about the rate at which the cryptocurrencies that have been mined (or staked) would be taxed.</p>



<p>The document claims that these digital assets will be taxed at their official or current value in place, but it doesn&#8217;t specify where these valuations, which differ from exchange to exchange, come from. It&#8217;s also not clear if this value will be determined at the time the cryptocurrency is mined or at the end of the tax period.</p>

<p>The taxes would not be connected to any other taxes imposed by the Argentine national government and would be paid to the provincial government. The document clarifies that <strong>this tax will only be imposed where the hardware utilized to carry out the activity is situated within the province&#8217;s boundaries.</strong></p>



<p>Analysts&#8217; concerns concerning applying this tax mostly revolve around two topics. The first one has to do with how tax-exempt equipment is defined.</p>



<p>Solely <strong>ASIC</strong> <strong>miners</strong> and graphics cards will be considered for these taxes if the authorized documents only mention proof-of-work hardware. However, staking might also be subject to taxation if computers operating staking nodes are seen as a component of this hardware.</p>



<p><strong>Buenos</strong> <strong>Aires</strong> declared in April that beginning in <strong>2019</strong>, customers would be able to pay taxes using cryptocurrencies. As part of its push for modernization and digitization, the city has a project to deploy a blockchain-based ID system and will host <a href="https://news.coincu.com/150255-ethereum-dev-plan-to-start-for-the-shanghai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a> nodes in <strong>2023</strong>.</p>
