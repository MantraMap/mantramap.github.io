<p>MicroStrategy has turned a profit on its significant Bitcoin investment as the premier cryptocurrency soars the charts.&nbsp;</p>
MicroStrategy Turns A Profit
<p>With Bitcoin finally overcoming the $30,000 price tag hurdle, leading business intelligence firm and largest institutional BTC-holder, MicroStrategy, is finally turning a profit on its reserves. The company had gone all in on its audacious investment strategy, religiously allocating a portion of its capital to buy the dip and stock up its Bitcoin reserves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The strategy seems to have paid off, with the cryptocurrency breaking through the $30,000 ceiling and staying consistently above it for the last several hours, at the time of writing. The price surge has helped MicroStrategy&rsquo;s funds and turned profitable.&nbsp;</p>
TradFi Renews BTC Interest
<p>The company has invested millions of dollars into its Bitcoin strategy across several installments made in a time when the market was exceptionally volatile and the crypto was barely breaking the $20k threshold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, recently there has been an increasing institutional interest in the crypto owing to the number of spot Bitcoin ETF applications from several major TradFi players like BlackRock Investments, WisdomTree, and Invesco. As a direct result, Bitcoin has seen a significant price increase as investors are hoping to have more investment options, should these BTC ETF applications be approved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
The Big Spot BTC ETF Push
<p>Following a successful first quarter, Bitcoin briefly maintained its positive momentum in the second quarter. In mid-April, the leading cryptocurrency surpassed the $31,000 mark. However, it soon entered a correction phase, experiencing weeks of underwhelming performance amidst legal controversies. Bitcoin's rally reignited after BlackRock submitted its Bitcoin ETF application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just recently, crypto expert, Ki Young Ju pointed out that MicroStrategy's Bitcoin holdings, which amount to 140,000 BTC, were close to reaching the break-even point at $30,045. Today, when Bitcoin's price reached that level, the portfolio completely recovered from all its previous losses. Currently, with Bitcoin priced at $30,057, the company&rsquo;s holdings have continued their profitable run.&nbsp;</p>
Saylor&rsquo;s Conviction Wins Out
<p>The company's investment has placed it among the few publicly traded companies to hold a significant amount of Bitcoin on their balance sheets. MicroStrategy's CEO, Michael Saylor, has been a vocal advocate for Bitcoin and has been instrumental in shaping the company's cryptocurrency investment strategy. He has repeatedly emphasized Bitcoin's potential as a long-term store of value and hedge against inflation and most recently claimed that the regulatory crackdown on altcoins, could result in Bitcoin&rsquo;s market dominance to reach 80% in the long term.&nbsp;</p>
