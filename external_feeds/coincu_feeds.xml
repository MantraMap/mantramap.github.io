<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Ethereum (ETH) has shown stability compared to Bitcoin and modest gains compared to some altcoins during a recent downward correction.</em></li>



<li><em>The price of Ethereum has recently increased by over 8%, with positive investor sentiment.</em></li>



<li><em>Breaking through resistance at $1,925 could lead to further rises toward $2,040 and potentially surpass the $2,125 barrier.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ethereum (ETH) is showing similar stability to Bitcoin. Contrary to the recent gallop of some altcoins, ETH remains one of the large-cap coins with modest gains.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2301-1024x683.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2301-1024x683.png" alt="Ethereum Stable At $1,820, What About $2,000 Target?" class="wp-image-199242" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2301-1024x683.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2301-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2301-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2301-750x500.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2301-1140x760.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2301.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Ethereum Stable At $1,820, What About $2,000 Target? 1"></a></figure></div>


<p>Ethereum price started a downward correction below $1,885 following a spike to $1,900 today. <a href="/t/eth/">ETH</a> previously spiked below $1,820 on June 15, but the drop has been limited, unlike Bitcoin.</p>



<p>Besides, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin shows that <a href="https://coincu.com/t/eth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ETH</a> is lagging behind other tokens is not an issue.</p>



<p>A user inquired about Buterin&#8217;s thoughts on the US Governmental approach to cryptocurrency in light of recent enforcements. The Ethereum creator expressed regret that significant projects like as Solana are being targeted in this manner. He said that these blockchains do not deserve this treatment.</p>



<p>He said that if Ethereum wins and all other blockchains are booted off crypto exchanges, it would not be an honorable way to win. But, he claims that this isn&#8217;t even a long-term win.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2302.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="959" height="640" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2302.png" alt="Ethereum Stable At $1,820, What About $2,000 Target?" class="wp-image-199247" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2302.png 959w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2302-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2302-768x513.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2302-750x501.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 959px) 100vw, 959px" title="Ethereum Stable At $1,820, What About $2,000 Target? 2"></a></figure></div>


<p>The price of Ethereum has increased as purchasing power has accumulated near support levels, signaling a positive mindset and increased investor interest. Ethereum&#8217;s price has surged by more than 8% in the previous 24 hours. With its present momentum and the broader rising trend in the crypto market, Ethereum might reclaim the $2,000 level if Bitcoin&#8217;s price continues to rise into the $35,000 region.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2297.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="623" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2297-1024x623.png" alt="Ethereum Stable At $1,820, What About $2,000 Target?" class="wp-image-199236" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2297-1024x623.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2297-300x182.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2297-768x467.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2297-1536x934.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2297-2048x1246.png 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2297-750x456.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2297-1140x693.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Ethereum Stable At $1,820, What About $2,000 Target? 3"></a></figure></div>


<p>Through the price chart above, to hit $2,000, ETH needs to break through its nearest resistance level at $1,925. In the near term, the $1,820 price zone is unlikely to come back, as if the price hits this level again, it would mean that recent gains have been erased. Closing above $1,925 might spark a new rise. The next level of resistance is at $2,000, over which the price might increase to $2,040. Any more advances might push Ether beyond the $2,125 barrier level.</p>



<p>The fact that the current price is at the Fib 50% level is also a condition for ETH to slow down the uptrend, if there is a breakout, it is likely that the price will break above the Fib 61.8% level corresponding to $1,950.</p>

<p>For developers, v9.2 introduces an improved interface with enhanced search and tracking capabilities and extended development platform support.</p>



<p>The upgrade will introduce several improvements and new features to optimize performance and enhance cross-chain functionality. Among them, the main enhancements are enhancing interoperability between EVM and Scilla, and simplifying ERC-20 and ZRC-2 smart contracts to create, test, and launch codes alternative messages to facilitate seamless cross-chain interactions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Other improvements include extended testing coverage for third-party EVM contracts and full backward compatibility with all Scilla contracts currently in the Scilla 0.13.3 release. This reinforces Zilliqa&#8217;s commitment to security and robust functionality.</p>



<p>Additionally, the upgrade includes various bug fixes, improved server-side resiliency and overall network performance improvements, the introduction of enhanced search and tracking capabilities for developers, and support for Extended development platform support.</p>



<p>The Zilliqa team will provide quick updates on the completion of the upgrade and appreciate the understanding and patience of all network participants during this period.</p>



<p>Zilliqa (ZIL) is one of the cryptocurrencies designed to solve the scalability and transaction processing problems plaguing the Ethereum network. However, the recent Ethereum consolidation and stiff competition in the Layer 2 scaling space with newer protocols offering higher throughput have declined Zilliqa (ZIL) usage.</p>



<p>However, the positive news about improvements from the main network update motivates the ZIL price to increase sharply by nearly 9% in the past 24 hours. Currently, ZIL is trading at $0.212.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>South Korea passes first independent cryptocurrency bill to strengthen investor protection.</em></li>



<li><em>19 cryptocurrency-related bills integrated, imposing penalties for violations, insurance, and reserves required.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>South Korea passed the first independent cryptocurrency bill to strengthen investor protection, integrating 19 cryptocurrency-related bills, including imposing penalties for violations such as the use of non-public information, market manipulation, and unfair trading practices, Insurance, reserves, and necessary record keeping are required. </strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2296.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="700" height="400" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2296.png" alt="South Korea Integrates 19 Cryptocurrency Bills For Investor Protection" class="wp-image-199224" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2296.png 700w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2296-300x171.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" title="South Korea Integrates 19 Cryptocurrency Bills For Investor Protection 6"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>South Korea&#8217;s parliament recently <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-30/south-korea-passes-inaugural-standalone-crypto-bill-after-spate-of-scandals" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-30/south-korea-passes-inaugural-standalone-crypto-bill-after-spate-of-scandals" rel="noreferrer noopener">passed</a> the Virtual Asset User Protection legislation to boost investor protection and regulate crypto. This legislation includes penalties for violations such as the use of non-public information, market manipulation, and unfair trading practices. The Financial Services Commission will oversee crypto operators and asset custodians, and the Bank of Korea will have the power to investigate these platforms. The act requires insurance coverage, reserve funds, and necessary record-keeping. The rules cover assets such as Bitcoin, while existing capital-markets law applies to tokens deemed securities.</p>



<p>The legislation comes just over a year after the implosion of tokens created by South Korean crypto entrepreneur Do Kwon exacerbated a $2 trillion crypto-market rout. Kwon was recently sentenced to four months in jail in Montenegro for trying to travel with a forged passport. He is wanted by South Korea and the US after the 2022 collapse of his TerraUSD and Luna coins wiped out at least $40 billion.</p>



<p>Investors were recently reminded of the risks in the digital-asset sector when two crypto lenders with links to South Korea halted withdrawals in quick succession in June. In March, a high-profile Seoul murder case linked to crypto investment losses stoked calls for politicians to accelerate new rules.</p>



<p>The Korea Blockchain Enterprise Promotion Association in Seoul welcomes the authorities&#8217; attempt to build order, but they argue that the law remains stuck in the perspective of traditional finance in terms of regulating crypto, which may suppress the industry rather than promote it.</p>



<p>Jurisdictions around the world are stepping up efforts to regulate digital assets. Places like Hong Kong and Dubai are seeking to attract crypto investment, while the European Union recently passed its landmark Markets in Cryptoassets (MiCA) regulation. US agencies have implemented a crackdown after a string of blowups, including the FTX exchange&#8217;s bankruptcy.</p>

<p>The Korean Financial Services Commission&#8217;s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) seized Delio&#8217;s virtual asset operating and financial data today and is conducting an on-site examination.</p>



<p>Delio is also being investigated by South Korean authorities, according to reports. Prior to June 25, it was reported that South Korean authorities had barred top officials from leaving the country from B&amp;S Holdings, Delio, and Haru Invest. </p>



<p>The company&#8217;s creditors previously filed to the Seoul Bankruptcy Court through the LKB &amp; Partners law firm for the company&#8217;s bankruptcy reorganization process (the original court took over proceedings), and the law firm is presently bringing a class action lawsuit against Haru Invest and Delio.</p>

<p>Delio announced the suspension of withdrawals on June 14 due to Haru Invest, and South Korean authorities have barred top company officials from leaving the country. It said on June 26 that it would begin cryptocurrency deposit and withdrawal services on June 28 for the following coins: Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), Tezos (XTZ), Polkadot (DOT), Kusama (KSM), Near (NEAR).</p>



<p>The company gave a bogus explanation on the day of the suspension of daily deposit and withdrawal, claiming, &#8220;It has nothing to do with Haru,&#8221; but the firm confessed the following day that he deposited virtual assets on the same day.</p>

<p>Venom Network is a layer 0 blockchain developed by the Venom Foundation and is also the first network supervised under the authority of ADGM &#8211; Abu Dhabi Global Market International Financial Center.</p>



<p>According to the Venom Foundation, their mission is to promote the widespread adoption of blockchain technology. They provide innovative technologies and frameworks that comply with the law and create a secure environment for a wide range of users, from retail customers to institutions and sovereign states.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Unique asynchronous architecture</h2>



<p>Venom Network is a unique blockchain with asynchronous architecture. The network&#8217;s unparalleled innovation ensures endless scalability, low costs, and fast transactions. All those advantages are mainly due to its robust system design.</p>



<p>Asynchronous blockchain technology deviates from the order of transactions, which is why Venom Network promotes high scalability. Real-time processing and the large volume of transactions. Venom Network has very little difficulty achieving these specifications. When the network encounters too many trades, validators split into pools to process concurrent transactions, known as &#8220;split events.&#8221;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2290.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="805" height="242" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2290.png" alt="Venom Network Review: Increase Scalability With Asynchronous Architecture" class="wp-image-199211" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2290.png 805w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2290-300x90.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2290-768x231.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2290-750x225.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 805px) 100vw, 805px" title="Venom Network Review: Increase Scalability With Asynchronous Architecture 11"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Structure of Venom Network</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>A heterogeneous multi-blockchain platform with dynamic sharding that is one of a kind and consists of a main chain, a work chain, and a shard chain, all of which work together as part of a powerful blockchain technology Venom Network&#8217;s power.</p>



<p>The three layers support parallel transaction processing, so Venom Network can process between 100,000 and 1 million transactions per second (TPS).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Main chain</strong></h3>



<p>As a layer 0 blockchain, it ensures that all necessary information is present to reach a consensus among validators. Therefore, you must consider this as a coordinator with significant responsibility for the workflow and the fragment chain. Information such as network configuration, implementation and scope of validators, and election rounds are all stored on the main chain. This is where the shard configuration begins and where you will find the latest block hash of the shard chain, where you will find the origin of our blockchain.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Workchains</strong></h3>



<p>Workchains are layer 1 blockchains hanging below the main chain. Each workchain features state transitions, cryptographic primitives, transaction or block structures, and native crypto while enjoying the security of the main chain. Rigorous security by consensus and central chain validator provides an opportunity for heterogeneous Venom Blockchain. Workchains can take on different roles and operate independently of each other. Venom has up to 2³² workstreams to support the Foundation&#8217;s grand ambitions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Shardchains</strong></h3>



<p>Each Shardchain has the same DNA as the work chain. However, the liability is much more limited as it belongs to only a small group of accounts. Each chain has its own memory space, consisting of a set of smart contracts stored on the blockchain. Shardchain is limited to the transactions of these contracts only. With 2⁶⁰ shardchains per workchain, a huge amount of capacity can be accessed.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>General advantages of asynchronous blockchain:</strong></h3>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2289.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2289-1024x576.png" alt="Venom Network Review: Increase Scalability With Asynchronous Architecture" class="wp-image-199210" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2289-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2289-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2289-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2289-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2289.png 1100w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Venom Network Review: Increase Scalability With Asynchronous Architecture 12"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<ul>
<li><strong>Increased Scalability</strong>: One of the critical benefits of asynchronous blockchain technology is its scalability under high transaction volumes. This is done through dynamic sharding, which allows a blockchain to process transactions in parallel and significantly increases its overall throughput.</li>



<li><strong>Faster Transaction Processing</strong>: Asynchronous blockchain technology allows transactions to be processed independently of each other instead of in a sequential order. This means that transactions can be processed significantly faster, making it suitable for applications that require real-time processing.</li>



<li><strong>Lower costs</strong>: Asynchronous blockchain technology allows a blockchain to process transactions in parallel instead of sequentially. This means less processing power is needed to process a certain number of transactions, which can lead to lower costs for businesses and organizations. Users do not need to pay extra gas fees for transactions in front of the pool, as is done in outdated queuing methods like BTC and ETH.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Outstanding features of Venom Network</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Dynamic sharding</strong></h3>



<p>The feature used by Everscale, Ethereum 2.0. Dynamic sharding enables increased transaction processing capacity and network capacity. In addition, Venom Network allows to adjustment the number of shards based on network needs to ensure the platform can handle large transaction volumes without compromising security or decentralization.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Threaded Virtual Machine (TVM)</strong></h3>



<p>TVM helps to increase processing speed and improve network performance compared to traditional virtual machines. In addition, the TVM used on the Venom Blockchain is similar to the EVM on Ethereum, playing an essential role in the execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications on the blockchain.</p>



<p>However, the disadvantage of TVM is that it is challenging for developers because most developers will be more used to EVM than TVM. Therefore, to overcome this weakness, Venom Blockchain only allows the integration of EVM and other virtual machines in shardchains &#8211; an area with lower security than Basechain and Masterchain.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Threaded Solidity (T-Sol)</strong></h3>



<p>T-Sol is a new programming language exclusively for Venom Network. Therefore, T-Sol still needs to be more widely used and supported by the community than the Solidity language. This can be difficult for developers when they want to use T-Sol to build on Venom. However, given the size of Venom, many people are expected to support and use T-Sol in the future.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Venom Network Ecosystem</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2288.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="496" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2288.png" alt="Venom Network Review: Increase Scalability With Asynchronous Architecture" class="wp-image-199208" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2288.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2288-300x145.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2288-768x372.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2288-750x363.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Venom Network Review: Increase Scalability With Asynchronous Architecture 13"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Venom Wallet</strong></h3>



<p>It is a non-custodial crypto wallet for storing digital assets derived from the Venom blockchain, such as VENOM tokens, NFTs, and other custom tokens. Other functions include sending and receiving tokens, accessing Web3 marketplaces, swapping between multiple tokens, etc.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Venom Bridge</strong></h3>



<p>A bridge is a dApp that facilitates the exchange of digital tokens from one blockchain to another. The Venom Bridge supports such swaps between the Venom, Fantom (FTM), BNB Chain (BSC), and Ethereum networks</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Venom pool</strong></h3>



<p>Validators who wish to verify transactions on Venom will use the Pool feature to stake their VENOM tokens, redeem rewards, and engage in other governance activities. This feature is currently in testnet mode</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Web3World</strong></h3>



<p>A Venom blockchain-based decentralized exchange (DEX) relies on an automated market maker (AMM) model to generate liquidity. It offers the widest range of swap pairs with high liquidity as deep as possible. Similarly, as of publication, this DEX is yet to launch officially.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Venom scanner</strong></h3>



<p>As the name suggests, a scanner is a discovery service that allows users to track transactions, fee trends, and other critical network-related metrics;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Oasis Gallery</strong></h3>



<p>This is the first NFT marketplace on Venom Network to support a non-fungible token created natively on Venom. Users can browse, buy, sell, and trade these digital assets here as it launches.</p>



<p>These are official apps created and maintained by Venom Foundation only. Communities can also create and launch custom apps cost-effectively, meaning that with increased adoption, the number of dApps on Venom will surely grow.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Venom Network Tokenomics</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>VENOM token</strong></h3>



<p>The Venom blockchain features a native platform cryptocurrency known as the VENOM token, which is a transfer of value within the Venom Network.</p>



<p>The VENOM token is currently inflated, with an initial market supply of 7.2 billion tokens. The document shows that the Foundation plans to change its supply metrics and transition to a deflationary model once several key metrics are achieved, including adoption, volume, and utility.</p>



<p>VENOM serves four main purposes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Payment of transaction fees;</li>



<li>Governance through PoS consensus mechanism;</li>



<li>Incentivize validators to participate in the transaction verification process to receive rewards;</li>



<li>Increase network security by attracting enough validators.</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>WVENOM token</strong></h4>



<p>VENOM is the native token of the Venom blockchain, and WVENOM is a TIP-3 standard token implemented in smart contract code. DeFi protocols only support TIP-3 for ease of deployment and general compatibility, in this respect, the Venom network follows standard practice in most blockchains.</p>



<p>WVENOM is a swappable TIP-3 token issued 1-1 with the VENOM token. You always have the option of converting your WVENOM back to VENOM.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Gas and fees</h2>



<p>A specific amount of Venom tokens must be attached when sending a message to the network. This is used to compensate validators for their work, cover the costs of storing the message on the network, and return any remaining balance as change.</p>



<p>There are several important characteristics of commissions:</p>



<ul>
<li>The cost per unit of gas on the network is fixed and is outlined in the global configuration, which can only be modified by the consensus of validators.</li>



<li>The network also charges a commission for data storage for the entire duration of their existence in the network.</li>



<li>The commission is always paid from the contract balance, as external messages cannot be value-bearing messages.</li>



<li>The user decides how many VENOM to attach as payment fees from their contract account for the call. The attached value is the upper limit for the cost of executing the call chain. Typically, the DApp automatically suggests a recommended value for the user.</li>
</ul>



<p>Each phase is associated with its own type of fee. Inbound external message fee: the only fee that is not related to the transaction execution phases described. It is charged when a transaction is initiated by an external message as a fee for sending the message (forward message fee).</p>



<p>Fees in the context of execution phases:</p>



<ul>
<li>Storage: related to the namesake fee (Storage fee) and charged for storing the contract and associated data.</li>



<li>Credit: the only phase that does not involve charging any fee.</li>



<li>Compute: charges a fee (Gas fee) for calculations performed in the called account (contract).</li>



<li>Action: each outgoing message from the contract, both external and internal, must be paid a fee (Action fee) as a fee for sending the message.</li>



<li>Bounce: in case of an error, an exception will be created, and an internal outgoing message will be taken, for which a fee will be charged as a fee for sending the message.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>With a rapidly changing technology like blockchain, there is a need for a protocol that is more future-proof than first and second-generation networks. Venom Network is heralding an innovative idea of having multiple layers supporting more than one type of blockchain.</p>



<p>With fast confirmation speeds, low transaction fees, regulatory compliance, and highly secure credentials, Venom is poised to be a remarkable smart contract and Web3 blockchain that competes directly with industry leaders current industry leader.</p>

<p>The tokens scheduled for burning are TRXOLD, PAX, DAI, USDP, PAXG (on the Binance Smart Chain), PAXG (on the Binance Chain), BUSD, and USDC. These tokens represent a range of digital assets that have been pegged to their corresponding fiat currencies or assets, providing users with liquidity and stability.</p>



<p>By burning these idle tokens, BNB aims to enhance the efficiency of its token ecosystem. The act of token burning involves permanently removing a certain quantity of tokens from circulation, thereby reducing the total supply. This reduction in supply often contributes to price stability and can generate positive effects on market dynamics.</p>



<p>However, the token burning process initiated by BNB is distinct from the traditional concept of token burning, as it is tied to the release of collateral on their native networks. This approach allows BNB to maintain a balanced utilization of resources while ensuring the liquidity and availability of the underlying assets.</p>

<p>Binance&#8217;s decision to burn these specific Binance-pegged tokens underscores the exchange&#8217;s commitment to actively manage its token ecosystem and optimize the allocation of resources. By releasing the equivalent amount of collateral tied to these tokens, BNB aims to enhance liquidity and support the broader crypto ecosystem.</p>



<p>As token burning has become a widely adopted practice among various blockchain projects and exchanges, market participants will closely observe the potential impact of this move on the supply dynamics of the burned tokens. Additionally, stakeholders will monitor how the release of collateral contributes to the overall stability and liquidity of the respective native networks.</p>



<p>Binance&#8217;s proactive approach in managing its token ecosystem reflects the company&#8217;s ongoing efforts to adapt and optimize its operations. By strategically burning idle tokens and releasing collateral, Binance aims to strengthen its position as a leading cryptocurrency exchange while promoting a healthy and efficient crypto market ecosystem.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Solana has experienced a significant surge in price, reaching nearly $20 and trading at around $18.9, with a 16% increase in the past 24 hours.</em></li>



<li><em>The integration of deBridge Finance into the Solana network has facilitated cross-chain communication and contributed to its active user base.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The price of Solana has soared in astonishing enormous rises, almost reaching $20. The competitive smart contracts token is presently trading at $18.9, up 16% in the past 24 hours.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2286-1024x533.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="533" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2286-1024x533.png" alt="Solana Makes Final Breakthrough In June As It Nearly Reaches $20" class="wp-image-199200" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2286-1024x533.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2286-300x156.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2286-768x400.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2286-750x391.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2286-1140x594.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2286.png 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Solana Makes Final Breakthrough In June As It Nearly Reaches $20 16"></a></figure></div>


<p>While the crypto market is typically calm, with the odds favoring the bulls, SOL is one of the best-performing coins on Friday.</p>



<p>SOL has risen more than 16% in the past 24 hours and is now trading at roughly $18.9. Saga mobile, the network&#8217;s Web3 smartphone, led to a 300% rise in daily trade volume, exceeding $1 billion. Notwithstanding the SEC&#8217;s charges that Solana is an unregistered security asset, its creators and the worldwide community remain hopeful.</p>



<p>Following the latest price increase, the SOL price is more likely to close in June, retesting the macro downtrend. However, cryptocurrency traders&#8217; attention is focused on the price of Bitcoin, which seems ready to break out and eat the altcoin market share.</p>



<p>The Solana network embraced deBridge Finance after more than a year of development to enable developers to smoothly interface with other EVM-compliant chains. Furthermore, the deBridge Solana SDK makes it simple for DeFi projects to link their Solana protocols to the deBridge infrastructure and begin delivering cross-chain communications. This is one of the driving reasons behind the Solana Network&#8217;s active user base.</p>

<p>SOL has had a spectacular pullback since June 10, its price even touched the threshold of $13.2 and bounced when Bitcoin regained the $30,000 mark after 2 months. Importantly, the SOL price is about to approach the Fib 50% area, and above that is the dynamic resistance created by the bearish trend line.</p>

<p>Next, it is possible that altcoins&#8217; outperformance for the moment is temporary as Bitcoin&#8217;s dominance is still very high, suggesting that SOL&#8217;s strong rise could be halted or recovered to support. Its former support is at $16.3, which is also the price zone of the Fib 23.6% level.</p>



<p>In the near term, we might consider approaching the SOL when the price is above $20 and there is a strong bullish signal or waiting for the price to rise firmly when a new support zone is formed after this rally.</p>

<p>The proposal suggests allocating 20,000 ETH to the protocol fund, with the goal of generating additional revenue to offset ongoing costs. Currently, the project is in the main voting phase, set to conclude in the early hours of July 1, and has garnered a 100% approval rate. Following this vote, a second voting period will commence.</p>



<p>According to the proposal, the expected rate of return on the 20,000 ETH, estimated to be around 4% to 6% annually, could potentially yield an additional $2 million in revenue for the Lido protocol. This anticipated increase in earnings highlights the community&#8217;s proactive approach to securing the financial sustainability of the project.</p>

<p>The move to allocate funds to the protocol fund aligns with Lido&#8217;s objective of creating useful assets that can generate revenue streams. By committing a portion of the ETH holdings, Lido aims to ensure ongoing operational viability while simultaneously exploring avenues to maximize returns for its participants.</p>



<p>The Lido community&#8217;s proposal signifies the collaborative nature of decentralized governance within the project. Community members have actively engaged in discussions and voting processes, contributing to the decision-making that shapes the protocol&#8217;s direction. This inclusive approach fosters transparency and empowers stakeholders to have a say in the project&#8217;s economic aspects.</p>



<p>As the voting process progresses, Lido participants and stakeholders eagerly await the outcome, recognizing the significance of the decision for the protocol&#8217;s financial sustainability and long-term growth. The proposal&#8217;s high approval rate in the main voting phase demonstrates the collective belief in the merits of the allocation and the potential benefits it may bring to the Lido ecosystem.</p>

<p>Should the proposal pass successfully, the subsequent second voting period will provide further opportunities for the community to engage and shape the implementation details. This iterative process ensures that community members have multiple chances to voice their perspectives and contribute to the final outcome.</p>



<p>The Lido community&#8217;s proposal to allocate 20,000 ETH to the protocol fund represents a strategic move to enhance the project&#8217;s financial strength and generate additional revenue. By actively managing their assets and seeking ways to increase earnings, Lido continues to demonstrate its commitment to providing sustainable decentralized staking solutions on the Ethereum network.</p>

<p>In a series of tweets, Buterin highlighted his concerns about the competitive nature of the blockchain ecosystem and the encroachment of centralized systems at the expense of individual freedom.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The one comment I&#39;ll make is that I feel bad that <a href="https://twitter.com/solana?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@solana</a> and other projects are getting hit in this way. They don&#39;t deserve it, and if ethereum ends up &quot;winning&quot; through all other blockchains getting kicked off exchanges, that&#39;s not an honorable way to win, and in the long term…</p>&mdash; vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1674644137847451649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June 30, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Buterin began by expressing his sadness over the attacks on projects such as Solana, stating, &#8220;I feel sad that Solana and other projects were attacked in this way and they should not be attacked like so.&#8221; These remarks demonstrate Buterin&#8217;s empathy towards projects facing adversity and his belief in fostering a cooperative and supportive environment within the crypto community.</p>



<p>However, Buterin also voiced his concerns about Ethereum&#8217;s position in the market. He claimed that Ethereum appeared to be &#8220;winning&#8221; by allowing other blockchains to integrate and facilitate swapping capabilities. He expressed reservations about this approach, considering it less honorable and potentially unsustainable in the long run. According to Buterin, the real competition lies not among different chains, but rather in the rapid expansion of centralized systems that are being imposed on individuals at their own expense.</p>

<p>In his final tweet on the matter, Buterin expressed his hopes for fair outcomes for all projects involved in the current situation.

<p>Buterin&#8217;s tweets garnered significant attention within the crypto community, with many users appreciating his candid perspective on the industry&#8217;s dynamics and the need for a balanced approach to competition and cooperation. His remarks also served as a reminder of the challenges faced by emerging projects and the importance of supporting one another in the face of adversity.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The SEC will respond to Coinbase&#8217;s defense on July 13 after a recent court ruling.</em></li>



<li><em>The exchange argues that the SEC lacks authority over the assets traded on its platform, as they are not securities.</em></li>



<li><em>The pre-trial meeting has been moved to July 13, and Coinbase maintains that many of the coins mentioned in the lawsuit are outside the SEC&#8217;s jurisdiction.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to a recent court ruling, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will respond to Coinbase&#8217;s first legal defense on July 13.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2276-1024x768.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2276-1024x768.png" alt="Coinbase Defies The SEC In Landmark Lawsuit Showdown" class="wp-image-199155" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2276-1024x768.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2276-300x225.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2276-768x576.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2276-750x563.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2276-1140x855.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2276.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Coinbase Defies The SEC In Landmark Lawsuit Showdown 24"></a></figure></div>


<p>This timing is surprising since Coinbase used a &#8220;creative&#8221; defense strategy by delivering its initial answer 40 days before the August 7 deadline. The SEC was supposed to respond to the exchange&#8217;s argument by July 3, but owing to the July 4 holiday weekend, they asked for a three-day extension, which the court granted.</p>



<p>Coinbase said in a letter filed just before midnight on Wednesday in Manhattan federal court that the SEC lacks the power to pursue civil claims against it because the assets traded on its platform are not &#8220;investment contracts&#8221; and hence not securities.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Coinbase has answered the SEC’s complaint with numerous defenses, including that this action violates due process and constitutes an abuse of discretion. But there is a more fundamental problem with the SEC’s case— one that the Chair recognized two years ago and that entitles Coinbase to judgment on the pleadings now: The subject matter falls outside the SEC’s authority,” the exchange’s counsel said in a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.599908/gov.uscourts.nysd.599908.23.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">letter</a> to the court.</p>

<p>In addition, the pre-trial meeting has been renamed a pre-motion conference and has been shifted from August 24 to July 13 at 14:00 UTC. Coinbase has maintained in its response to the SEC&#8217;s complaint that many of the coins referenced in the lawsuit are outside of the Commission&#8217;s purview.</p>

<p>On June 6, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Coinbase, alleging that it gained billions of dollars as a middleman, including by trading at least 13 crypto assets, or tokens, such as Solana, Cardano, and Polygon, that should have been registered as securities. Coinbase was also sued for its &#8220;staking&#8221; scheme, in which it pools crypto assets to maintain activity on the blockchain network in return for &#8220;rewards&#8221; it gives to consumers after taking fees.</p>
