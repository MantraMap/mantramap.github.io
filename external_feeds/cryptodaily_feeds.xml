			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Orbiting 30491 Technicals:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 3 July 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) sought fresh technical guidance early in the Asian session as the pair continued to orbit the 30491.62 area, representing the 50% retracement of the appreciating range from 29539.57 to 31443.67.&nbsp; &nbsp;The pair&rsquo;s recent depreciation to the 29417.14 area represented a test of the 38.2% retracement of the appreciating range from 26165.98 to 31443.67.&nbsp; The decline occurred after BTC/USD spiked higher to the 30277 area, its strongest print in several trading sessions, and increased the possibility of a test of the 28604.83 area.&nbsp; BTC/USD notched a June gain of approximately 11.9%, and the pair is now up approximately 83.4% year-to-date.&nbsp; The pair&rsquo;s recent print around the 31443.67 area was a twelve-month high and test of an upside price objective associated with buying pressure that strengthened around the 26637.41 area.&nbsp; Additional upside price objectives include the 31737, 32125, and 33569 areas.&nbsp; Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 31674, 32043, 34531, and 34658 areas.</p>
<p>Following recent selling pressure, areas of potential technical support and buying pressure include the 29863, 29427, 28886, 28804, 28182, 28096, and 27306 areas.&nbsp; &nbsp;Stops were also recently triggered above additional upside price objectives around the 29068, 29159, 29458, 30088, 30200, 30292, and 30477 levels.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Technicians are closely watching to see how much technical support develops around the 28095.44 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the historical depreciating range from 69000 to 15460.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 30497.77 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 30517.17.</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;24440.41/ 23270.10/ 22769.39 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;31986.16/ 32989.19/ 34658.69 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bearishly below SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bearishly below MACDAverage.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bearishly below SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bullishly above MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Ethereum Name Service (ENS) Labs has announced plans to introduce Layer 2 (L2) interoperability for its ENS domains during a community call on June 28.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The implementation aims to improve performance, scalability, and cost efficiency for users managing their ENS domains.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The decentralized domain name system is set to implement off-chain resolvers, leveraging an ENS off-chain registrar contract and the services of Coinbase&rsquo; cb.id, Lens Protocol, and OptiNames on the Optimism network. This step comes as the L2 ecosystem continues to witness an influx of projects and protocols.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">According to L2Beat data, the total value of assets locked on L2 service providers has surged by over 190% in the past year, standing at $9.78 billion at the time of writing. Arbitrum leads the market with a 60% share and a total value locked (TVL) of $5.87 billion.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">ENS domain name registrations experienced robust growth in Q2 2021. Dune Analytics data shows monthly ENS domain name registrations totalling 79,463 last quarter. June, marked by a significant drop in gas fees on the Ethereum Network, recorded the highest number of registrations during the quarter with 35,932 ENS name registrations.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">While .eth name registrations ended Q2 with a surge, primary ENS name registrations saw a notable decline. A primary ENS name is a unique domain name registered and associated with an Ethereum address on the ENS platform. Moreover, ENS registered a cumulative profit of $4.8 million between April 1 and June 30, despite a 21% dip in revenue during this period. ENS&rsquo; annualized revenue has fallen by 5.11%, as per Token Terminal.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The daily price performance chart of ENS showed an increase in ENS token accumulation since mid-June, along with a corresponding 22% value growth. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) indicators were on an upward trajectory, indicating a bullish run.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) plays a pivotal role in enhancing the user-friendliness of the Ethereum network by replacing complex blockchain addresses with easy-to-remember names. With the latest move of introducing Layer 2 interoperability, ENS Labs takes a significant stride towards improving the operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness of managing ENS domains.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This development arrives amidst a growing trend of Layer 2 adoption across the blockchain sphere, an effort to counteract the scalability and performance bottlenecks often associated with the Ethereum mainnet. By enabling Layer 2 solutions, ENS is not only keeping pace with industry trends but also reaffirming its commitment to user experience and network efficiency.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Crypto infrastructure developer Polygon Labs has proposed a new, four-layered architectural design for its upcoming "Polygon 2.0" project.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The announcement, made on June 29, offers a detailed look at the planned infrastructure, which comprises four unique "layers" working in tandem to secure and scale networks built on the protocol. With a bridge aggregator set to make transactions &ldquo;near-instant and atomic,&rdquo; Polygon 2.0 is poised to dramatically reshape the crypto industry.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Polygon 2.0: A Four-Layered Approach</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The new proposal outlines the foundation of the project, the &ldquo;staking layer,&rdquo; which is currently in existence. This layer comprises a "validator manager" contract on Ethereum, along with an additional "chain manager" contract for each Polygon chain. Future Polygon chains will be able to form by launching new chain manager contracts on Ethereum.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Built on top of this staking layer will be an "interoperability layer," providing bridges to connect each Polygon chain via Ethereum. This layer will also feature an aggregator that combines individual zero-knowledge proofs from each bridge into one proof before sending it to Ethereum, enabling &ldquo;seamless&rdquo; bridge transactions and &ldquo;dramatically reducing Ethereum gas consumption for proof verification,&rdquo; according to the team.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Polygon Labs elaborates in its announcement:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"We believe this proposal can and should direct all Polygon protocol development efforts moving forward, serving both as the conceptual North Star and the formal development framework."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">The two remaining layers of Polygon 2.0 will include the current execution layer, which relies upon the Erigon Ethereum client, and a "proving layer" that will standardize the zero-knowledge-proof process across all Polygon chains.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">A Future-Proof Infrastructure</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Polygon isn't the only network attempting to transform into a multi-chain ecosystem. Other developers like zkSync Era and Optimism are working on similar strategies, but Polygon 2.0's unique four-layered approach sets it apart.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In a statement, the team promises more information on each layer in the future, stating:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"Polygon 2.0 consists of four protocol layers, each enabling an important process within the network: Staking Layer, Interop Layer, Execution Layer, Proving Layer."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">With the proposal now public, the network&rsquo;s validators will need to approve it. Polygon 2.0's vision, as expressed by the development team, is to establish &ldquo;the value layer&rdquo; of the internet, promising a more secure and scalable network.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Just as the internet is an elastically scalable, unified environment for accessing information, Polygon 2.0 seeks to serve as an elastically scalable, unified environment for accessing value.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Parallels With Early Internet Innovations</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">With a vision of enabling an "Internet of Blockchains", Polygon 2.0's strategic design could revolutionize the scalability and interoperability of blockchain technology. Polygon Labs&rsquo; commitment to enhancing the tech stack and protocol layers supports the global shift towards decentralized systems, heralding a new era in digital innovation and resource management.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The suggested architecture of Polygon 2.0 is reminiscent of the Internet protocol suite, a modular, flexible, and efficient framework that has become the backbone of our global digital ecosystem. Each layer in the proposed Polygon 2.0 is designed to facilitate a specific sub-process, streamlining the protocol implementation, updates, and potentially transforming the way we interact with the blockchain.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">In the broader context of the blockchain space, this development reflects the industry's collective pursuit of scalability, efficiency, and interoperability. As an increasing number of organizations turn to blockchain solutions for various applications, the necessity for adaptable, scalable, and unified frameworks becomes even more apparent. In providing such an architecture, Polygon 2.0 could significantly contribute to the blockchain ecosystem's growth and the wider acceptance of decentralized solutions.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s5">With thousands of cryptos in the dip, finding tokens that will deliver gains in the short and long term has become a hassle. However, recent analyses have pointed to Uwerx, a new crypto that has defied market odds with its presale and bullish token surpassing expectations. </p>
<p class="s5">The WERX token has witnessed over a 100% surge due to its utility, with analysts predicting that WERX, which started at $0.005, could reach $1 by Q1 of 2024.</p>
<p class="s5">This article will give deeper insights into what makes Uwerx unique, its presale, and the 2024 price predictions for Chiliz (CHZ). </p>
<p class="s8">&gt;&gt;BUY WERX TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
Chiliz (CHZ) 2024 Predictions As It Gains Bullish Sentiments
<p class="s5">Chiliz (CHZ) was recently listed as a security by the SEC. This action which took a huge toll on many cryptos seems to have not had much effect on Chiliz (CHZ), as evidenced in its token&rsquo;s recent performance. Chiliz (CHZ) has continued trending, recording above 17% increase in the past week. </p>
<p class="s5">This is quite surprising as the token has been in the red for over two months before the SEC&rsquo;s action. Hence, the recent traction is bewildering. </p>
<p class="s5">Chiliz (CHZ) continues to display strong potential, meaning it will likely gain a price increase. The CHZ token sells at $0.07591, but 2024 predictions show it could reach $0.15. </p>
<p class="s5">The recent bullish sentiments Chiliz (CHZ) has witnessed show the token might not be entirely market dependent but is affected by the value it provides and the moves it makes.</p>
Chiliz (CHZ) Launches The Sports Blockchain, Gets Listed In The Asian Markets
<p class="s5">Chiliz (CHZ) is a Layer-1 protocol revolutionizing the entertainment and sports industry and bringing them to Web3. Chiliz&rsquo;s (CHZ) recent launch of the Sports Blockchain is a testament to this vision and its continued efforts to actively connect fans with their favorite teams and players.</p>
<p class="s5">This separates it from the tons of cryptos in the market, putting it in the spotlight since its 2016 launch. The Sports blockchain provides the infrastructure and facilities needed for sports. Chiliz(CHZ) has begun migrating Fan Tokens to the blockchain, and so far, it has moved that of PRSJ, RIVER, TIGERS, SHARKS, HASHTAG, and BENFICA.</p>
<p class="s5">Chiliz (CHZ), which faces delisting in the US, has been listed among the over 400 tradeable assets in the Indonesian market. This announcement has further boosted the CHZ token, signifying a future surge in trading activities. </p>
<p class="s8">&gt;&gt;BUY WERX TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
Uwerx&rsquo;s (WERX) Presale Exceeds Initial Forecasts
<p class="s5">The speed at which Uwerx&rsquo;s presale progressed is still shocking, as it started just a few months back and is now in its final round, stage 5. The increased demand for WERX has led to increasing the presale WERX quantity to 427.5 million. 72.5 million WERX is available in stage 5, and WERX total supply is 750 million. </p>
<p class="s5">The WERX price has tremendously increased, as it is now at $0.047725, a huge surge from the starting price of $0.005. The same goes for its launch price, as WERX is set to launch at $0.095 - $0.115. There is an ongoing 15% purchase bonus to further benefit users at the current presale stage.</p>
Uwerx (WERX) Has Competitive Advantage Over Centralized Freelancing Platforms
<p class="s5">A recent report shows that 71% of companies hire freelancers to increase business agility, especially during economic uncertainty. These companies will usually go to freelancing platforms that provide better working conditions and services at a subsidized rate, which is why Uwerx will gain massive adoption.</p>
<p class="s5">Uwerx will be the first decentralized freelancing platform as it integrates blockchain technology. It will charge only a 1% service fee against the 10 or 20% charged by centralized platforms. Another innovative feature of this project is the Uwerx Vault, which is similar to the concept of staking. The Vault acts as a storage for users to store their tokens while simultaneously providing rewards. </p>
<p class="s5">Uwerx&rsquo;s Alpha version has been launched and now has features such as Freelancer Profile Creation, Hiring Dashboard Page, Forgot Password, Sign-Up and Logging Pages, Initial Step of Job Creation, Freelancer or Client Initiation, Job Creation Process Page, My Activity Page, Settings, Initial Step of Finding Talent, Milestone, and Application Boosting using the WERX token.</p>
<p class="s11">The Job Creation Page was revamped to the Post Job and Apply Page to make it easier for freelancers to apply for jobs. Features like Freelancer and Client Dashboards and Tools will soon be released.</p>
<p class="s11">The platform has gained over 1,825 Telegram members, 1,652 Twitter followers, and 6,953 sign-ups. SolidProof and InterFi Network have conducted audits on Uwerx and approved its security.</p>
<p class="s11">Uwerx will soon be transitioning to its Beta version, which is now in the works. This will allow users to test the platform. Many developments have been made, and users will be updated soon. </p>
<p class="s11">The project&rsquo;s success also follows the agile methodology the developers use to release the project in bits while making improvements following users&rsquo; feedback. The team is user-based, welcoming users&rsquo; feedback and putting them into action. This feedback can be sent to their email, feedback@uwerx.network. </p>
<p class="s11">Following a modification of the WERX allocations, the team re-assigned only 7% of the total WERX allocation to themselves (previously 8%) and locked their token share, which will last for nine months. This action was hastened by the 82.8% of the community who voted for them to start before the presale ended, and it began on June 7. The presale ends on July 31. </p>
<p class="s11">The team will give up the ownership of the smart contract immediately after Uwerx launches on centralized exchanges. Also, a Test Airdrop will be conducted to validate receiving wallet addresses for users after 98.2% of the token holders voted for this. </p>
<p class="s11">Uwerx has all it takes to become a dominating force in the freelancing industry with its fundamental advantages over traditional freelancing platforms. Indeed, it is poised for massive adoption. </p>
<p class="s11">Its presale is the best opportunity to enter this blue-chip future at an extremely good price. Solook no further! Purchase the WERX token now for a 15% purchase bonus.</p>

<p class="s11">Following a modification of the WERX allocations, the team re-assigned only 7% of the total WERX allocation to themselves (previously 8%) and locked their token share, which will last for nine months. This action was hastened by the 82.8% of the community who voted for them to start before the presale ended, and it began on June 7. The presale ends on July 31. </p>
<p class="s11">The team will give up the ownership of the smart contract immediately after Uwerx launches on centralized exchanges. Also, a Test Airdrop will be conducted to validate receiving wallet addresses for users after 98.2% of the token holders voted for this. </p>
<p class="s11">Uwerx has all it takes to become a dominating force in the freelancing industry with its fundamental advantages over traditional freelancing platforms. Indeed, it is poised for massive adoption. </p>
<p class="s11">Its presale is the best opportunity to enter this blue-chip future at an extremely good price. Solook no further! Purchase the WERX token now for a 15% purchase bonus.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>InQubeta (QUBE) has joined Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) on Reddit&rsquo;s list of tokens selected to enjoy bull runs in 2023. Ethereum has had the most substantial price growth in 2023 with its prices rising by over 60%. Bitcoin lagged behind Ethereum, despite having the larger market capitalization, with its prices only growing by about 40% at the height of its bull run.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency markets have been generally bearish since the two most popular tokens&rsquo; price growth earlier in the year, but that hasn&rsquo;t stopped InQubeta&rsquo;s presale from exceeding all expectations. Tokens allocated for the presale&rsquo;s beta stage were sold out before the period ended. Investors standing to increase the value of their investments by 400% thanks to incremental price changes at each of the presale's ten stages is one of the best deals in the cryptocurrency world.</p>
InQubeta (QUBE) making waves with Reddit investors
<p>Reddit investors know a thing about bull runs so it&rsquo;s prudent to consider which cryptocurrencies or other investment opportunities are popular on the forum. Redditors wreaked havoc on Wall Street whales a few years ago when the forum backed stocks like GameStop and AMC, squeezing hedge funds that were shorting them.</p>
<p>The Reddit mania led to $24 billion being traded on U.S. stock exchanges on Jan 27, 2021, exceeding the previous high of $8 billion set during the 2008 financial crisis. GameStop stock prices went skyrocketing, forcing investors shorting the stock to purchase some to minimize their losses, driving prices further up.</p>
<p>InQubeta is the latest cryptocurrency project to gain the attention of Redditors as its platform makes investments in artificial intelligence more accessible for everyday people. It&rsquo;s not surprising to see Reddit investors, many of whom view themselves as the little people sticking it to the big whales, embrace a democratic platform that empowers everyday people who might not meet the elitist standards of traditional investment channels, like minimum investments that surpass the average annual income in the U.S.</p>
The InQubeta way
<p>InQubeta makes becoming part-owner of an artificial intelligence startup as easy as buying non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the ecosystem&rsquo;s marketplace. Startups looking for capital make these equity-based NFTs on InQubeta&rsquo;s Ethereum-based blockchain and investors purchase them with $QUBE tokens.</p>
<p>The NFTs are sent to investors after sales are finalized and they&rsquo;re free to sell or hold on to them at any point. These NFTs work like stocks, and some come with extra rewards like a slice of the startup&rsquo;s profits.</p>
<p>Thanks to InQubeta, investing in what many are already calling the biggest tech revolution in human history is now more accessible than ever. The internet was the last significant tech breakthrough and it created many millionaires and billionaires. For instance, $2,000 invested in Netflix in the early 2000s would be worth over a million dollars today. InQubeta&rsquo;s approach to investing now makes similar investment opportunities available to all.</p>
<p></p>
Bitcoin (BTC) is almost halfway back to pre-2022 prices
<p>Bitcoin continues to enjoy the largest market capitalization in the cryptocurrency space and it&rsquo;s already enjoyed some decent growth in 2023. Many cryptocurrency experts are expecting a bigger bull run later in the year.</p>
Ethereum (ETH) growing faster than Bitcoin
<p>Ethereum has seen more price increases in 2023 than Bitcoin due to various reasons like Ethereum-based altcoins like InQubeta and Polygon (MATIC) making waves in mainstream and crypto investment circles. Ethereum will likely continue outpacing Bitcoin for the remainder of the year but don&rsquo;t expect it to keep up with InQubeta.</p>
Summary
<p>InQubeta has an excellent chance of seeing more growth than more popular coins like BTC and ETH thanks to incremental price changes during its presale and its tokens being undervalued. Investors can expect to increase the value of their portfolios by up to 400% during the presale period, and there are no limits for InQubeta prices from that point.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The latest partnership between Near Protocol (NEAR) and Alibaba caused the Near Protocol (NEAR) price to spike, leading experts to wonder whether the token can hold its upward momentum. Meanwhile, Tradecurve (TCRV), currently in Stage 4 of its presale, has exceeded everyone&rsquo;s expectations, surging over 80% in price and raising $2.8 million in a very short amount of time.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
Near Protocol (NEAR) Spikes 12% After Alibaba Partnership
<p>The Near Foundation, the non-profit organization behind the Near Protocol (NEAR), recently partnered with Alibaba Cloud intending to accelerate Web3 growth in the Middle East and Asia. Namely, this Near Protocol (NEAR) partnership will provide remote procedure calls (RPC) as a service to Near Protocol (NEAR) users and developers, among other benefits.</p>
<p>As a result, Near Protocol (NEAR) surged 12% as soon as the announcement was made, driving its price to the $1.56 level. However, Near Protocol (NEAR) did not manage to sustain its upward movement, with the Near Protocol (NEAR) token currently trading at $1.36.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
Tradecurve (TCRV) Surges 80%, Amassing Over 12,500 Users on Its One-Of-a-Kind Platform
<p>Tradecurve (TCRV) is a new hybrid trading platform that will allow people to use their crypto balances to trade stocks, bonds, options, forex, commodities, ETFs, and crypto, all from one account. Also, due to its decentralized nature, TCRV will enable users worldwide to trade on thousands of markets completely anonymously with no need to meet any KYC requirements.</p>
<p>To trade on TCRV, all users need to do is create an account, connect their crypto wallet, deposit the crypto they want to use, and start trading immediately.</p>
<p>Tradecuve is the only trading platform on the market that combines the best elements of centralized and decentralized exchanges under one roof, well-positioning itself to challenge the likes of Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken and earn a spot among the top-three global trading platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, TCRV will provide its token holders with many exclusive benefits, including discounts on trading fees, high leverage at 500:1, algorithmic AI trading, and copy-trading (where users can pay a subscription fee to traders with good success rates to copy their traders).</p>
<p>Also, the TCRV team plans to launch its own metaverse trading academy where users can take courses and learn about trading techniques to improve their skills.</p>
<p>Tradecurve is currently in Stage 4 of its presale, where investors can buy tokens at $0.018 and receive a 50% deposit bonus. Additionally, due to its unprecedented real-world utility and high demand, TCRV has already raised $2.8 million and attracted over 12,500 users. As a result, experts believe the token will deliver 50x gains before it launches on exchanges, when it will rise by an additional 100x.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Better After 29427 Test:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 2 July 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) worked to remain above the 30000 figure early in the Asian session as the pair encountered month-ending volatility that saw a rapid depreciation to the 29417.14 area, representing a test of the 38.2% retracement of the appreciating range from 26165.98 to 31443.67.&nbsp; This quick downward move took place shortly after BTC/USD spiked higher to the 30277 area, its strongest print in several trading sessions, and opens up a possible test of the 28604.83 area.&nbsp; BTC/USD notched a June gain of approximately 11.9%, and the pair is now up approximately 83.5% year-to-date.&nbsp; The pair&rsquo;s recent print around the 31443.67 area was a twelve-month high and test of an upside price objective associated with buying pressure that strengthened around the 26637.41 area.&nbsp; Additional upside price objectives include the 31737, 32125, and 33569 areas.&nbsp; Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 31674, 32043, 34531, and 34658 areas.</p>
<p>Following recent selling pressure, areas of potential technical support and buying pressure include the 29863, 29427, 28886, 28804, 28182, 28096, and 27306 areas.&nbsp; &nbsp;Stops were also recently triggered above additional upside price objectives around the 29068, 29159, 29458, 30088, 30200, 30292, and 30477 levels.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Technicians are closely watching to see how much technical support develops around the 28095.44 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the historical depreciating range from 69000 to 15460.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 30456.83 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 30515.87.</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;24440.41/ 23270.10/ 22769.39 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;31986.16/ 32989.19/ 34658.69 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bearishly below MACDAverage.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bullishly above MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has been ordered by a federal court to turn over user account information and transaction history to the IRS so that it can check if the exchange&rsquo;s users underreported their taxes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The order comes amidst a growing crackdown on crypto and will require the exchange to provide significant user data to the authorities.&nbsp;</p>
The IRS Headache&nbsp;
<p>As a result of the ruling, Kraken will have to hand over swathes of user information to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Internal Revenue Service had filed a court petition in the Northern District of California moments after Kraken had announced that it would settle charges brought against it by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC had charged Kraken with offering unregistered securities through its staking as a service program. The IRS had previously issued a summons to Kraken in 2021, but the exchange failed to comply. The IRS had stated in its February petition,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Despite discussions between the parties, Payward Ventures Inc. [one of the registered companies that make up Kraken] &amp; Subsidiaries has failed to comply with the summons and has not produced the books, records, papers, and other data demanded in the summons. Payward Ventures Inc. &amp; Subsidiaries&rsquo; failure to comply with the summons continues to this date.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The IRS has stated that it is seeking information on Kraken accounts that have carried out at least $20,000 worth of cryptocurrency trading in a single year between 2016 and 2020. On its part, Kraken has called the tax agency&rsquo;s summons an &ldquo;unjustified treasure hunt.&rdquo; It also argued that the summons went well beyond the boundaries set in a similar fight with Coinbase around six years ago.&nbsp;</p>
The Court Order&nbsp;
<p>The federal court ruling comes as regulatory authorities in the United States of America increase their crackdown on the crypto markets. The Securities and Exchange Commission has already filed lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase, alleging that the former mishandled customer funds, misled investors, and broke securities laws, while the latter was running an illegal exchange. The order passed on Friday orders Kraken to turn over account details and user information such as taxpayer identification number, birth date, user name or pseudonym, phone number, email address, address, and several other documents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, the exchange will also be required to turn over transaction hashes and blockchain addresses that are already a part of the transaction data that it can share. The judge wrote that the IRS has a legitimate purpose and reasoning for seeking the materials in question, adding that it must determine the tax liability for exchange users within the stipulated time period. The IRS&rsquo;s demands are backed by the fact that taxpayers filing returns for Bitcoin-related investments are minuscule compared to the sheer volume of trading activity on Kraken. The order stated that Kraken had over 4 million clients in the time period between 2011 to 2017, conducting over $140 billion worth of trades. Additionally, it stated that the exchange was registering 50,000 new users daily.&nbsp;</p>
Several IRS Requests Rejected&nbsp;
<p>However, not everything went the way the IRS wanted. In fact, the judge outright refused several requests put forward by the IRS. The judge also rejected the tax agency&rsquo;s requests for receiving employment information and source of wealth from the exchange. The judge wrote in his analysis of some of the requests,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Court must determine whether the Government&rsquo;s summons is narrowly tailored, that is, whether it is &lsquo;no broader than necessary to achieve its purpose. The Court finds that to the extent the first three requests are aimed at establishing the identities of the Kraken account holders who fall within the Doe definition, the information sought in these requests is much broader than what is necessary to achieve that purpose for the vast majority of Doe users.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>On May 26, 2023, during the annual Cannes Film Festival, the World Investment Congress Awards ceremony took place. The winner of the Investment Persona Congress Awards was Ukrainian IT businessman Mykola Udianskyi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The award ceremony for the Investment Congress Awards 2023 was an unforgettable night dedicated to the best and brightest representatives of the investment industry. At the gala dinner, led by event organizer Anna Stukkert and Investment Congress President Thomas Miss, companies, funds, platforms, brokers, consultants, the fashion industry, PR and media outlets that made a positive contribution to the investment industry were recognized.</p>
<p>One of the most anticipated parts of the evening was the announcement of the Investment Persona Congress Awards. This year, the winner was Mykola Udianskyi, a renowned Ukrainian entrepreneur in the field of information technology and technology, a scientist, and philanthropist. Mr. Udianskyi was recognized for his contributions to blockchain and cryptography, as well as his charitable activities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The 'Person of the Year' award according to the Congress Awards 2023 goes to Mykola Udianskyi, who is a visionary Ukrainian technology entrepreneur,&rdquo; commented Thomas Miss. "Mykola is the president of the EHOLD Group with 10 offices in 9 countries. EHOLD employs over 500 people serving a user base exceeding 10 million users in an impressive project portfolio.He is also the founder of the Qmall exchange, which is a Ukrainian market phenomenon.

<p>The organizers also acknowledged Mykola Udianskyi's charitable activities and his active civic position during the war with Russia.</p>

He also supports Ukrainian soldiers and openly speaks about the war from internationally recognized platforms," said Anna Stukkert. "This is truly inspiring and deserving of respect and support from the global business community."</p>

<p>It should be noted that this is not the first award for Mykola Udianskyi. In 2022, he was recognized as the best digital currency expert at the World Influencers and Bloggers Awards and ranked first in Hacker Noon's 2019 list of the top 10 blockchain entrepreneurs in the CIS.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BCH has seen a spectacular surge recently, registering weekly gains of 114.3%. </p>
<p>Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has become this week&rsquo;s highest gainer in the top 300 tokens by market cap following a 114.3% surge in price. The token continues its uptrend, spurred by its listing on EDX Markets.</p>
BCH Reaches One-Year High
<p>The token reached a one-year high this week, just days after it listed on the EDX Markets exchange. EDX is backed by several Wall Street heavyweights such as Fidelity Digital Assets, Citadel Securities, Sequoia Capital, and Charles Schwab.</p>
<p>Unlike other crypto exchanges, EDX only allows investors to trade bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and BCH.</p>
<p>Crypto research firm Santiment found BCH has benefitted from EDX&rsquo;s launch, rising trading volumes and social media interest.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">📈 With the assistance of #EDXMarkets, launched on June 20th, #BitcoinCash has been the biggest beneficiary with a massive +79% price gain in 4 days. Notably, $BCH has seen a 3-year high in social discussion rates, &amp; volume has easily eclipsed 2023 highs. https://t.co/6fz4RL28tH pic.twitter.com/MNn59zRy8T</p>

<p>The firm further found BCH&rsquo;s sudden price move attracted retail trader attention, with the token&rsquo;s trading volume this year hitting a record.</p>
BCH Surge Driven by South Korean Traders
<p>Industry analyst Colin Wu tweeted today that BCH&rsquo;s price increase may be due to trading activity on South Korean exchanges.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">South Korea may be the reason for the BCH PUMP. In the past 24h, the largest exchange in South Korea, Upbit, has recorded a trading volume of over $350 million for the BCH/KRW, contributing to 23.58% of the total trading volume for BCH.

<p>Wu noted South Korea&rsquo;s largest exchange Upbit recorded massive trading volumes on the BCH/KRW pair over the past 24 hours. He said more than $350 million in volume accounted for nearly a quarter of the total volume for BCH over that time.</p>
<p>BCH surged an incredible 31% over the past 24 hours, allowing it to top $300 for the first time since April 2022. The token, however, remains down 92% from its all-time high of $3,785 in December 2017.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Up 85% Year-to-Date:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 1 July 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) remained in a modest uptrend early in the Asian session as the pair continued to consolidate recent gains above the 30500 area after trading as high as the 31277 area.&nbsp; Buying power recently strengthened around the 30240.32 area during a slight pullback, a move that represented a test of the 23.6% retracement of the appreciating range from 26165.98 to 31443.67.&nbsp; &nbsp;BTC/USD notched a June gain of approximately 11.3%, and the pair is now up approximately 85.6% year-to-date.&nbsp; The pair&rsquo;s recent print around the 31443.67 area was a twelve-month high and test of an upside price objective associated with buying pressure that strengthened around the 26637.41 area.&nbsp; Additional upside price objectives include the 31737, 32125, and 33569 areas.&nbsp; Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 31674, 32043, 34531, and 34658 areas.</p>
<p>Following recent selling pressure, areas of potential technical support and buying pressure include the 29863, 29427, 28886, 28804, 28182, 28096, and 27306 areas.&nbsp; &nbsp;Stops were also recently triggered above additional upside price objectives around the 29068, 29159, 29458, 30088, 30200, 30292, and 30477 levels.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Technicians are closely watching to see how much technical support develops around the 28095.44 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the historical depreciating range from 69000 to 15460.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 30415.23 and the&nbsp;100-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 30429.07.</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;24440.41/ 23270.10/ 22769.39 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;31986.16/ 32989.19/ 34658.69 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bullishly above MACDAverage.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bearishly below SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bullishly above MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Just as bitcoin was looking as though it was going to break the critical $31,000 price level, the SEC threw a wrench into the works with its rejection of all the latest ETF filings.</p>
Oh no! Another rejection
<p>The crypto market was alive and buzzing once again, looking as though it had finally emerged from a harsh crypto winter on the back of institutional ETF filings that looked as though this time might be approved.</p>
<p>Gary Gensler at the SEC was having none of it. Blackrock, Fidelity et al could be damned. The Biden administration is absolutely determined to try and break the crypto industry, and even if the biggest institutional money in the country wants in, it&rsquo;s not going to happen on Gensler&rsquo;s watch.</p>
<p>The news dropped like a bomb onto the crypto market. The Wall Street Journal was first to report it with the headline:&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;SEC Says Spot Bitcoin ETF Filings Are Inadequate&rdquo;</p>

<p>Assuming that Blackrock and the rest had done their homework on the Bitcoin Spot ETF, it was hard to imagine what on earth else might be required by the SEC.</p>
Crypto market plummets
<p>In a matter of seconds bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market plummeted lower. Bitcoin immediately dropped to the exact bottom of its bull flag, made a beautiful touch, and then bounced back. It is currently sitting at the $30,200 price mark, which also happens to be the 0.618 Fibonacci level.</p>
<p>The altcoins fell even more drastically. The Total 3 chart (all cryptocurrencies except BTC and ETH) fell like a stone, losing over 4%, equivalent to around $13 billion in value.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Cash (BCH), probably the coin riding the highest up until the SEC announcement, rapidly fell over 13%, dropping from $314 to $272, before bouncing back around half way to $293.</p>
Was the news as bad as all that?
<p>Senior Bloomberg Analyst Eric Balchunas tweeted out soon after the announcement saying that in his view the news was not as bad as the headline suggested. He said that the SEC was really after the name of the crypto exchange for the &ldquo;surveillance-sharing agreement&rdquo; and required more details on SSA.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Hold up a second, this isn't as bad as headline. The key paragraph is deep in story. Basically SEC wants them to name the "crypto exchange" and give more details on SSA. That's understandable, arguably good news. I was under impression they'd have to update that as well. pic.twitter.com/bh9qn65Xh2</p>

<p>

</p>
<p>It does look as though the market is starting to digest this, and if the ETFs aren&rsquo;t being outright rejected then a surge in the opposite direction might be expected to take place. Hold on to your hats!</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Solana&rsquo;s Cardinal protocol just announced its decision to wind down operations and shut down, citing economic conditions.&nbsp;</p>
Cardinal Starts 2-Months &ldquo;Notice Period&rdquo;
<p>Nearly a year after raising $4.4 million, Solana&rsquo;s NFT utility provider, Cardinal Labs, has decided to pack it in. The protocol was launched in early 2022 as an infrastructure provider to improve NFT utility on the Solana network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, on Wednesday, the Cardinal team took to Twitter to announce that they would be winding down operations and eventually shut shop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They wrote,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Today is the first day of our 2 month &ldquo;notice period&rdquo; (6/28-8/26) during which we recommend any and all depositors of assets into our systems manually withdraw them. All of our website product UIs will remain live during the period so that no one should have any issue doing so.&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;Product Market Fit Difficult&rdquo;
<p>The team tweeted that the macroeconomic conditions have been very challenging for the protocol. They claimed that product market fit has been difficult, and although there has been some usage of the protocol&rsquo;s staking, rentals, and identity products, the market has not scaled up as they had hoped it would. Until blockchain tech adoption happens on a larger scale, the protocol&rsquo;s offerings are &ldquo;stuck in the context of the crypto maximalist community.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team also noted that the code behind the protocol will always be open source and accessible by all, even after the deployments are no longer live. They also reassured users that their assets were safe and would be returned to owners by the end of the process.&nbsp;</p>
Wind Down Schedule&nbsp;
<p>August 26 would mark the end of the two-month notice period, so users will need to complete all withdrawals by that date. The team has also dropped the closing schedule, which revealed that activities like creating staking pools, token management, NFT rentals and rental extensions, management of social media handles, and new deposits would be suspended on July 19.</p>
<p>The team tweeted,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As we move towards closing up shop, our focus now shifts to carrying out a wind down as smoothly as possible so that the Solana ecosystem doesn&rsquo;t skip a beat&hellip;We realize that many people and teams rely on our protocols, and we want to minimize the impact of this transition on the ecosystem as much as possible, so we&rsquo;ve worked deliberately to find a path that does just that.&rdquo;</p>

Another Solana Project Shuts Down

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Solana&rsquo;s Cardinal protocol just announced its decision to wind down operations and shut down, citing economic conditions.&nbsp;</p>
Cardinal Starts 2-Months &ldquo;Notice Period&rdquo;
<p>Nearly a year after raising $4.4 million, Solana&rsquo;s NFT utility provider, Cardinal Labs, has decided to pack it in. The protocol was launched in early 2022 as an infrastructure provider to improve NFT utility on the Solana network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, on Wednesday, the Cardinal team took to Twitter to announce that they would be winding down operations and eventually shut shop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They wrote,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Today is the first day of our 2 month &ldquo;notice period&rdquo; (6/28-8/26) during which we recommend any and all depositors of assets into our systems manually withdraw them. All of our website product UIs will remain live during the period so that no one should have any issue doing so.&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;Product Market Fit Difficult&rdquo;
<p>The team tweeted that the macroeconomic conditions have been very challenging for the protocol. They claimed that product market fit has been difficult, and although there has been some usage of the protocol&rsquo;s staking, rentals, and identity products, the market has not scaled up as they had hoped it would. Until blockchain tech adoption happens on a larger scale, the protocol&rsquo;s offerings are &ldquo;stuck in the context of the crypto maximalist community.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team also noted that the code behind the protocol will always be open source and accessible by all, even after the deployments are no longer live. They also reassured users that their assets were safe and would be returned to owners by the end of the process.&nbsp;</p>
Wind Down Schedule&nbsp;
<p>August 26 would mark the end of the two-month notice period, so users will need to complete all withdrawals by that date. The team has also dropped the closing schedule, which revealed that activities like creating staking pools, token management, NFT rentals and rental extensions, management of social media handles, and new deposits would be suspended on July 19.</p>
<p>The team tweeted,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As we move towards closing up shop, our focus now shifts to carrying out a wind down as smoothly as possible so that the Solana ecosystem doesn&rsquo;t skip a beat&hellip;We realize that many people and teams rely on our protocols, and we want to minimize the impact of this transition on the ecosystem as much as possible, so we&rsquo;ve worked deliberately to find a path that does just that.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Blockchain Association, a prominent lobbyist group for the cryptocurrency industry in the United States, has called on SEC Chair Gary Gensler to recuse himself from enforcing rules on the crypto space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission under Gensler has taken a hostile approach to crypto, filing lawsuits against several prominent crypto firms.&nbsp;</p>
Blockchain Association Pens Open Letter&nbsp;
<p>The call for the Securities and Exchange Commission Chair to remove himself from crypto-related matters was issued in the form of a statement released by the Blockchain Association. It comes after cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase filed a notice of intent on Wednesday, requesting a court to dismiss the regulator&rsquo;s lawsuit against the exchange. In the letter, the Blockchain Association contends that Gensler has repeatedly asserted that everything other than Bitcoin is a security and that his statement gives the appearance that he cannot approach the issue with an open mind. The letter alleged that repeatedly expressing the same view meant that the SEC chair had prejudiced the central issue regarding digital asset-related enforcement proceedings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, the letter alleged that Gensler&rsquo;s vote on whether or not to proceed with filing an action was biased. The Blockchain Association also stated that any SEC enforcement action must follow the &ldquo;Wells Process,&rdquo; which would give the target of the enforcement action enough time to present evidence and arguments for their case. However, thanks to Gensler&rsquo;s unbiased perspective, core questions related to the crypto industry would not receive a fair assessment from the SEC. Chief Policy Officer at the Blockchain Association, Jake Chervinksy, stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s clear that the digital assets industry cannot expect a fair assessment from Chair Gensler. His steadfast view that all digital assets except bitcoin are securities means that he cannot approach enforcement decisions with a fair and impartial mind, as required by the SEC&rsquo;s Wells process and federal law. The time has come for Chair Gensler to recuse himself from all decisions related to digital asset-related enforcement matters. If he refuses, then I expect enforcement targets will begin raising the matter of his recusal in SEC proceedings and in federal district courts.&rdquo;</p>

Coinbase And The SEC&nbsp;
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission had sued Coinbase, alleging that the platform offered users at least 13 crypto assets that are securities and should have been registered with the SEC. It had also sued Binance on similar charges just a day prior. In its reply, Coinbase stated that the Securities and Exchange Commission was well aware of the crypto exchange&rsquo;s digital asset operations thanks to its public offering registration, which was done in April 2021. It further added that out of the cryptocurrencies that the SEC called securities, 6 were already trading on Coinbase when the agency reviewed the exchange&rsquo;s public offering registration. Coinbase stated in its filing,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The only change is in the SEC&rsquo;s position regarding its powers. That position is untenable as a matter of law, and its assertion through this enforcement action offends due process and the constitutional separation of powers.&rdquo;</p>

SEC Action On Crypto&nbsp;
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission has undertaken considerable legal action against crypto exchanges during the ongoing year. Kraken was fined $30 million for offering crypto staking programs, with the SEC stating that the exchange was offering users unregistered securities. The agency also issued a warning to the Paxos Trust Company, an issuer of the Binance stablecoin, that it faces possible legal action. This led to Paxos freezing the minting of the stablecoin, which the SEC stated was an unregistered security. Coinbase criticized the SEC&rsquo;s actions in its filing, saying that the SEC&rsquo;s action in the current scenario was unlawful.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather than test its new view through notice-and-comment rulemaking, the SEC has chosen to roll out its ever-aggressive agenda through punitive retroactive enforcement actions. Agency enforcement authority is important but not boundless. The SEC&rsquo;s action here is beyond those bounds and unlawful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Blockchain Association was also critical of the SEC, stating that the federal agency&rsquo;s actions under Gensler had further muddied regulatory waters and forced lawful crypto companies operating in the country to reconsider their operations and move to friendlier jurisdictions.&nbsp;</p>
The Political Divide&nbsp;
<p>Gensler&rsquo;s hostile approach to crypto has found support with many Democrats, who have lauded his efforts. However, lawmakers on the other side of the aisle have roundly criticized the SEC and Gensler&rsquo;s approach. Republican Congressman Warren Davidson also introduced a bill called the SEC Stabilization Act on the 13th of June. The bill sought to restructure the federal agency and remove Gensler as chair.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Binance&rsquo;s crypto custody licence application has reportedly been rejected by the German BaFin regulator.</p>
Another setback
<p>Still the largest crypto exchange in the world by trading volume, Binance is continuing to labour into strong headwinds, suffering regulatory pushback in some European countries, and of course currently being sued by the US regulator.</p>
<p>The latest setback for Binance was reported by the German-based Finance Fwd website. The article stated that the BaFin regulator had either officially denied a crypto custody licence application, or had verbally notified Binance that its licence had been rejected.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Binance was quoted as saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even if we cannot share details of our discussions with the regulators, we will continue to work to meet Bafin's requirements. It is an ongoing process&rdquo;</p>

<p>They added:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are confident that we have the right team and the appropriate measures to continue our discussions with the regulatory authorities in Germany.&ldquo;</p>

<p>The rejection in Germany will be a difficult pill to swallow for Binance&rsquo;s CEO Changpeng Zhao, better known as CZ. The ongoing defence of his company and him personally in the US is a weight around the neck of the crypto exchange.</p>
Battlegrounds need to be won
<p>With such a globally important regulator as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accusing CZ of embezzlement of customer funds among other allegations, obtaining regulatory licences in other countries is going to be difficult, at least until it is known how the accusations are likely to pan out.</p>
<p>Given that Binance is such an important exchange in the crypto ecosystem many may be hoping that it is able to resist the SEC. Both Binance and Coinbase are very important battlegrounds that need to be fought and won if the crypto industry is to reinject some momentum into the beleaguered asset class.</p>
