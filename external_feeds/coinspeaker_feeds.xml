<p>The demand for mortgage in the United States nosedived at the tail end of 2022 following a two-week reprieve. </p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/mortgage-demand-2022-interest-rates/">Mortgage Demand Slides 13.2% to Conclude 2022 amid Rising Interest Rates</a></p>
<p>Mortgage demand in the US ended 2022 down 13.2%, with interest rates on the rise. Following a brief lull in the first half of December last year, mortgage application volume sank substantially at the end of last week.</p>
<p>The reason for this downturn was higher mortgage interest rates. For example, the average contract interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage went up to 6.58%. Barely two weeks ago, this figure stood at 6.34%, rising from 3.33% at the end of 2021. Most 30-year fixed-rate mortgages came with conforming balances of no more than $647,200 for loans and a 20% down payment.</p>
<p>According to the seasonally adjusted index by the Mortgage Bankers Association, demand for refinancing declined 16.3% from two weeks ago. In addition, this demand, which is ultra-sensitive to weekly interest rate changes, is down a massive 87% from the 2021 period.</p>
<p>The MBA remained closed last week due to the festive season.</p>
<h2>MBA Economist Analyzes 2022 Mortgage Demand Decline</h2>
<p>Commenting on the waned 2022 mortgage demand development, MBA economist Joel Kan said that “mortgage rates are lower than October 2022 highs but would have to decline substantially to generate additional refinance activity.”</p>
<p>In addition, Kan <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/04/mortgage-demand-plunges-interest-rates-rise.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">explained</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Purchase applications have been impacted by slowing home sales in both the new and existing segments of the market. Even as home-price growth slows in many parts of the country, elevated mortgage rates continue to put a strain on affordability and are keeping prospective homebuyers out of the market.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, the MBA economist also pointed out the recessionary threat as an added causative factor for the application decline.</p>
<p>As it stands, mortgage applications for home purchases are down 12.2% from two weeks earlier. Also, this figure was at a 42% drawdown year-over-year (YoY) and ended 2022 at its lowest level since 1996.</p>
<p>Although mortgage rates began 2023 marginally lower, attention would likely shift to the crucial monthly employment report due Friday. It is a given that the incoming report would further impact rates. However, it remains unclear whether this influence would be for better or worse.</p>
<h2>October Highs</h2>
<p>On October 4th last year, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/mortgage-interest-rates-highest-2008/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> stated that mortgage interest rates were riding on a 14-year high. At the time, this surge triggered fears and talks of fast-tracked recession across the housing space. However, Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride noted that the increase did little to slow down inflationary pressure. As he put it at the time:</p>
<blockquote><p>“This cumulative effect of this sharp rise in rates has cooled the housing market and caused the economy to start slowing, but hasn’t done much to lower inflation.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Besides the 30-year fixed mortgage rate, the 15-year variation also grew to 6.16% from 5.80% last October. Furthermore, 5/1 ARM increased from 4.90% to 5.25% within a week, while 30-year fixed jumbo loans climbed from 6.58% to 7.06%.</p>
<p>Although interest rates remain high presently, the Fed previously suggested that it would begin to taper to avert a full-blown recession.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/indonesia-crypto-exchange/">Indonesia to Float Crypto Exchange This Year</a></p>
<p>The Indonesian government may be moving in a positive direction with respect to its plans to support the growth of the crypto ecosystem on its shores and is set to float a crypto exchange before the end of this year. As <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-04/indonesia-to-start-crypto-exchange-ahead-of-regulatory-shift" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> by Bloomberg, the country is making this move, which has <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/indonesia-crypto-stock-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long been in the plan</a>, ahead of its proposed plans to cede regulations of the industry to a whole new overseer.</p>
<h2>The Indonesian Regulatory Shift</h2>
<p>The crypto ecosystem in Indonesia is a very subtle one with an age-long ban on the use of digital currencies for payments as far back as 2017. The regulators still permit the trading of cryptocurrencies, albeit, the trading is done in line with the extant rules governing commodities. As a result, the oversight of the industry is being provided by the Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency, known as Bappebti.</p>
<p>In light of the current global financial advancement, the Indonesian government has been making moves to reform the financial ecosystem, one of which will seek to harmonize different aspects of the industry. The reform, dubbed the Financial Sector Development and Reinforcement bill (P2SK), was endorsed by the House of Representatives of Indonesia on December 15.</p>
<p>The reform will be implemented over the next two years and will see the Financial Services Authority (FSA) take over the oversight of the crypto industry in a more distinct pivot to securities trading. The shift in regulators has been <a href="https://economy.okezone.com/read/2022/12/22/278/2732243/uu-p2sk-atur-pengawasan-aset-kripto-di-ojk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">described</a> by Suminto Sastrosuwito, a head of Financing and Risk Management of the national finance ministry as an avenue to ensure crypto has an “equal basis with other financial and investment instruments.”</p>
<p>Despite Indonesia still being a relatively warm hub for crypto users, the country has seen a remarkable plunge in ecosystem statistics over the past 2 years. From the 16 million active investors in the industry as of the end of 2021, the number shrank to 11.2 million in the first 11 months of the crypto-winter in 2022. Within the same period, the total value of digital currencies traded plunged from 859 trillion rupiahs to a mere 300 trillion rupiahs ($19.2 billion).</p>
<p>In Indonesia today, a total of 383 digital currencies and 10 local tokens can be traded by investors on approved exchanges in the country. Per the Bloomberg report, as many as 151 assets and 10 tokens are still under review by Bappebti</p>
<h2>Indonesia to Protect Its Fiat with Its Crypto Laws</h2>
<p>Banning the use of crypto for payment on its shores is a very stern attempt by the Bank of Indonesia to protect the legal tender status of the fiat currency.</p>
<p>However, the apex bank understands the dynamics in the payment evolution and has highlighted its own roadmap with respect to the development of its <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Central Bank Digital Currency</a> (CBDC) also known as the Digital Rupiah.</p>
<p>According to an update shared in December by the bank’s governor, Perry Warjiyo, the conceptual design of the Digital Rupiah has been done and will soon be made open to the public for constructive discussion.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/nezha-cars-nio-2022/">China’s Nezha Delivered More Cars than Nio in 2022</a></p>
<p>Nezha, an upstart Chinese electric car company, claimed that it delivered more cars than automobile manufacturer <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/nio/">Nio</a> did in 2022. Nezha is named after a Chinese mythology character and is another budget-friendly electric car brand focused on compact SUVs. Specifically, the company said its car delivered in 2022 was over X2 to surpass 152,000 vehicles. Out of the delivered cars, the most deliveries were Nezha V, a compact SUV with post-subsidy prices beginning from 83,900 yuan ($12,000).</p>
<p>Indeed, Nezha offers budget-priced electric vehicles compared to Nio. Nio’s largest SUV has more features, including a longer driving range starting from about 400,000 yuan. During the last year, Nio delivered over 122,000 electric vehicles, representing a 34% increase YoY. The deliveries include its premium-priced sedan. Already, the company has stressed that it is focusing on the higher-end segments. It mentioned the plans to roll out a mass-market brand as well. CEO William Li discussed a meeting with its mass-market team in early November. The team expected each model in the segment to sell over 50,000 units monthly. In total, that is about 600,000 cars per model every year.</p>
<p>According to Nezha, the company also exported more than 3,500 cars in 2022. It started a partnership in Thailand that helped it push into Southeast Asia. The company is still looking to partner, as it shows on the English-language website that it seeks partners in Cambodia and the Philippines. This indicates that Nezha is continuously looking to expand across different regions.</p>
<p>Nio also fell behind the US-listed Chinese electric car company in 2022. Li Auto reported that its deliveries for the year pumped 47% to over 133,000 cars. As for Xpeng, the company saw a slower growth of 23% YoY to over 120,000 cars in 2022.</p>
<p>Despite the persisting coronavirus pandemic that led to shutdowns in China, the Chinese electric car market is still bubbling. The Chinese government also supports the development of the domestic EV industry, and each city has preferential policies encouraging their use. The China Passenger Car revealed that more than a quarter of passenger cars sold between January and November 2022 were new energy vehicles. Notably, there is fierce competition among EV manufacturers in the country.</p>
<p>Hongguang Mini boasts of the bestseller spot among new energy passenger cars in China in 2021. At the time, the budget electric car recorded X3 sales of 395,451 YoY.</p>

<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/core-scientific-celsius-mining-rigs/">Core Scientific Powers Down Celsius 37,000 Mining Rigs</a></p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/core-scientific-celsius-mining-rigs/">Core Scientific Powers Down Celsius 37,000 Mining Rigs</a></p>
<p>Core Scientific Inc (OTCMKTS: CORZQ), the bankrupt crypto miner and hosting service provider has <a href="https://cases.stretto.com/public/X217/12024/PLEADINGS/1202401032380000000125.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">effectively powered down</a> as many as 37,000 mining rigs belonging to Celsius Network. Both companies, now bankrupt had been in a business relationship that turned unfavorable for Core Scientific as Celsius Network was unable to meet up with the costs of electricity, a key cost in mining Bitcoin (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC</a>).</p>
<p>Core Scientific was the hosting service provider for Celsius Network’s mining activities as approved by the court following its bankruptcy. According to Core Scientific, the increment in energy fees that came as a result of the ongoing war in Ukraine pushed the energy costs of Celsius Network to $7.8 million.</p>
<p>In earlier filings, Core Scientific blamed the inability of Celsius Network to meet up with the costs as one major reason why it faced a liquidity crunch pushing it to also file for bankruptcy last month. With the 37,000 mining rigs now offline, Core Scientific said it is on track to increase its revenue by at least $2 million if the price of Bitcoin stays around $16,700.</p>
<p>Besides rising energy prices, the major challenge that all miners irrespective of their geographical location have been facing over the past year is the volatility in the price of Bitcoin. Currently trading at $16,848.42 which favors Core Scientific, the coin has dropped by over 63% in the year-to-date period.</p>
<p>This uncertainty in the potential price growth of Bitcoin has forced many miners to file for bankruptcy as revenue and profits are no longer matching operational costs. By cutting power to the Celsius Network’s miners, Core Scientific can now appropriate the space in a way to bolster its own bottom line across the board.</p>
<h2>Core Scientific and the Fight for Survival</h2>
<p>Core Scientific is just one of the many names in the crypto ecosystem that is currently battling a liquidity crisis, however, chances are that the company’s creditors will not be as burned as those of other platforms that have also filed for bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Since the bankruptcy filing, it tendered back on December 21, Core Scientific has been pushing for a number of ways to stay afloat and minimize the impact of the liquidity crunch on its investors. One major way it resolved to do this is to <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/core-scientific-bankruptcy-mining/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continue its mining operations</a>.</p>
<p>While at the point of filing for bankruptcy, the company was generating a positive cash flow, however, it was unable to finance its agreements on equipment leases.</p>
<p>While Core Scientific Inc’s financial battery has been visible, the move to cut off Celsius Network mining rigs seems to be resonating positively with its investors as its shares closed Tuesday’s session up 81.485 to $0.074.</p>
<p>Other distressed crypto miners include but are not limited to Riot Blockchain Inc (NASDAQ: RIOT) and Argo Blockchain Plc (LON: ARB).</p>

<p>Leading exchange Binance was recently crowned winner among exchange performances for 2022 after dominating the crypto space. </p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-crypto-2022-winner/">Arcane Report: Binance Rules 2022 Roost of Crypto Exchanges as Winner</a></p>
<p><a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/4rilomtvvae4/6SExqAaqYIwlHl7FuT1VBH/7231fe008c6c984d4756d6b8f163c262/Ahead_of_the_curve_-_Jan_3_2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">According</a> to Arcane Research, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> is the clear winner among crypto exchanges considering performance in 2022. An Arcane January 3rd report highlighted the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/changpeng-zhao/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Changpeng Zhao</a>-led platform soared due to a favorable combination of factors. These include the fallout from <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ftx-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX&#8217;s</a> epic collapse and zero-fee Bitcoin (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC</a>) trading implementation. In addition, Binance undertook some notable global acquisitions in 2022 that further spurred its market dominance.</p>
<h2>Highlights of &#8216;Binance Crypto Winner&#8217; Report</h2>
<p>Part of the Arcane report read:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There are no other evident &#8216;winners&#8217; of 2022 other than Binance when it comes to the crypto market structure and market dominance. No matter how you look at it in terms of trading activity, Binance is the crypto market.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, the report added:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;After lifting trading fees for its BTC spot pairs this summer, Binance completely overtook all market share in the spot market. While the organic nature of some of this volume may be negotiable, it&#8217;s non-negotiable that this has consolidated Binance&#8217;s dominance over BTC spot markets.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>As of December 28th last year, Binance had captured an overwhelming 92% of the BTC spot market. In addition, the prominent crypto exchange also controlled 61% of the Bitcoin derivatives market by volume. Considering Binance&#8217;s Bitcoin spot market dominance, the exchange only controlled 45% of the said market at the beginning of 2022. This development suggests that Binance more than doubled its BTC spot market control, with its derivatives market share increasing by a third. The spot trading volume is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin transactions on spot exchanges at any time.</p>
<p>According to the Arcane report, Binance experienced a rise in BTC spot market dominance before the FTX collapse. At the time, the ill-fated Bahamian exchange was Binance&#8217;s closest rival and the second-largest crypto exchange in the world by volume. Unsurprisingly, Binance&#8217;s Bitcoin spot market dominance began to surge following the removal of fees for specific trading pairs last July.</p>
<h2>Binance Steepens Global Visibility</h2>
<p>Binance also emerged crypto exchange winner for 2022 after consolidating its global coverage with some notable acquisitions. Late last year, the world&#8217;s largest exchange by trading volume <a href="https://www.binance.com/en-NG/feed/post/97358" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">acquired</a> Japanese trading firm Sakura Exchange BitCoin (SEBC) on November 30th. At the time of the 100% acquisition, Binance CEO Zhao said that the exchange looked to enter the Japanese market. Binance&#8217;s buyout of SEBC marks the prominent exchange&#8217;s first license in East Asia.</p>
<p>Binance also increased its shareholding position at the Indonesian crypto brokerage platform Tokocrypto in December 2022. With that additional cash injection comes several shakeups at Tokocrypto. For instance, the Indonesian platform&#8217;s founder Pang Xue Kai will reportedly step down as chief executive officer. Pang Xue Kai will be replaced by Yudhono Rawis as Tokocrypto&#8217;s interim chief but will remain on the firm&#8217;s board of commissioners. At the time, the outgoing CEO explained that the move was to build a further physical trading platform for crypto assets.</p>

<p>According to Goldman’s 2023 macroeconomic, the recession in the UK will come close to the crunch in sanctioned Russia. </p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/goldman-sachs-uk-2023-recession/">Goldman Sachs Economists Predict UK 2023 Recession Could Rival That of Russia</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/goldman-sachs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Goldman Sachs</a> (NYSE: GS) economists <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/04/the-uk-recession-will-be-almost-as-deep-as-that-of-russia-economists-predict.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">recently predicted</a> that in 2023, the economic recession in the UK could hit as badly as Russia’s. In its <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/gs-research/macro-outlook-2023-this-cycle-is-different/report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">macro-outlook</a> for this year, Goldman touched on how the sharp decline in British household living standards impacted activity. According to the leading American bank, there could be a 1.2% contraction in the United Kingdom’s real GDP throughout 2023. In addition, Goldman stated there could be a 0.9% British economy expansion in 2024.</p>
<p>Goldman’s initial 1.2% forecast is well below the real GDP of all other Group of Ten (G-10) major economies. Only Russia is marginally worse off at a 1.3% contraction due to its protracted war in Ukraine. Additionally, the Eastern European powerhouse subsequently came under a torrent of hefty Western economic sanctions that have drained its economy’s lifeblood. According to Goldman, Russia could see a 1.8% economic expansion in 2024.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Goldman also projected that there could be a 0.6% contraction in the German economy for 2023. Furthermore, the multinational investment bank added that this development could be followed by a 1.4% expansion next year. Germany currently ranks as the next worst performer after Russia and the United Kingdom. However, Goldman was more optimistic in its US projections, with a 1% expansion this year, as well as another 1.6% growth in 2024.</p>
<h2>Goldman UK-Russia 2023 Recession Comparison Falls Below Market Consensus</h2>
<p>The Goldman UK projection, and comparison with a recession in Russia, falls below what the bank cites as a market consensus. This consensus estimates a 0.5% contraction in 2023 and a 1.1% expansion the following year. However, in late November, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) also forecasted that Britain would lag significantly behind other developed economies. According to the OECD, this delay could occur over the coming years and hold sway despite the UK facing the same macroeconomic constraints.</p>
<p>Goldman Chief Economist Jan Hatzius and his team pointed out that the eurozone and the UK are already both in a recession. According to the Goldman economic team, the aforementioned regions have already sustained a much more significant increase in household energy bills. The team concludes that inflation in Britain and the Euro area could drive inflation to higher peaks not seen elsewhere. Furthermore, the Goldman team of economic analysts added:</p>
<blockquote><p>“In turn, high inflation is set to weigh on real income, consumption, and industrial production. We forecast further declines in real income of 1.5% in the euro area through 2023Q1 and 3% in the UK through 2023Q2, before a pickup in H2.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Chief economist at KPMG UK, Yael Selfin, also weighed in. According to Selfin, the surge in food and energy costs and higher overall inflation had already eroded household purchasing power. In her own words:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Rising interest rates have added another headwind to growth. Lower income households are particularly exposed to the mix of current price pressures, as the most affected spending categories largely fall on necessities, with few substitutes in the short run.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Selfin further added that households would cut back on discretionary spending this year due to the income squeeze.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bytedance-cuts-hundred-jobs-china/">TikTok Parent ByteDance Cuts Several Hundred Jobs in China</a></p>
<p>As per the latest reports, ByteDance, the parent firm of the social media platform TikTok has cut hundreds of jobs across multiple departments by the end of 2022. TikTok has reportedly joined the list of companies that have been on a lay-off spree recently. Two sources familiar with the matter told SCMP that the layoffs come as TikTok plans to streamline its operations.</p>
<h2>ByteDance Cutting Jobs</h2>
<p>This move has also affected employees at Douyin which is the Chinese version of TikTok and has 600 million daily active users. ByteDance is one of the largest employers in china with a total workforce of over 100,000 employees worldwide. These job cuts represent a very small percentage of its workforce. With ByteDance being privately owned, they aren&#8217;t obliged to publicly disclose any information related to its business.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s tech sector has been facing major turbulence especially due to the major policy changes initiated by the government. In China&#8217;s tech sector, job cuts usually happen in the name of business optimization. Besides, it&#8217;s also a common practice for employers to sack underperformers.</p>
<p>Apart from that, the widespread Covid in China has impacted several businesses in the country last year. Other tech giants like Alibaba Group Holding and Tencent Holdings have cut thousands of jobs in 2022.</p>
<p>As per the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/3205410/tiktok-owner-bytedance-cuts-hundreds-jobs-multiple-departments-china-sources-say" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a> by SCMP, ByteDance’s enterprise collaboration tool Feishu, has been the hardest hit department. It has impacted a total of 10 percent of their workforce. The sources said that ByteDance will compensate all those laid-off employees based on their total years of job and an additional month of salary.</p>
<h2>ByteDance Gears for Overseas Expansion</h2>
<p>TikTok&#8217;s parent company is reported gearing up for an expansion into the overseas market where it&#8217;s hiring. The company&#8217;s website shows 10,000 job listings from marketing to engineering in cities such as London, Beijing, and Mountain View, California.</p>
<p>However, 2023 could be a very challenging year for ByteDance as TikTok is facing political headwinds in the US. The use of TikTok has been absolutely banned on all US federal government devices. Additionally, 19 states have blocked the app from state-managed devices. As per the latest reports, the White House is also considering the sale of TikTok’s US unit.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that TikTok is cutting jobs. Following Beijing&#8217;s ban on private tutoring in 2021, TikTok fired thousands of employees the same year. Last year in 2022, TikTok cut hundreds of jobs from its video game operations in Hangzhou and Shanghai.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there&#8217;s been a lot of uncertainty regarding the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bytedance-halts-ipo-security-warnings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">company&#8217;s IPO</a> last year. Chief financial officer Julie Gao, however, said that ByteDance has no plans to go public.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-federal-regulators-risks-crypto-assets/">US Federal Regulators Issues Joint Statement on Risks Related to Crypto Assets to Banking Organizations</a></p>
<p>Top United States regulatory agencies &#8211; including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) &#8211; have issued a joint warning statement on related crypto assets risks to financial institutions. According to the announcement, the events in the crypto market for the past year have highlighted the associated risks to banking organizations in dealing with digital assets.</p>
<p>After the market scaled to its ATH during the fourth quarter of 2021, almost the entire crypto market has been trapped in a multi-week bear market. Notably, the Terra Luna fallout, the $600 million Ronin Bridge attack, and the FTX implosion have been attributed to the heightened crypto-assets risks.</p>
<p>Consequently, banks offering crypto custodial and lending services have been significantly hit by the ongoing crypto bear market and blockchain attacks. As such, worldwide regulators are concerned with crypto projects’ tokenomics, which favors founders at the expense of customers.</p>
<h2>Feds Issue Risk Warnings to Banking Organizations Dealing with Crypto Assets</h2>
<p>The joint statement by United States regulatory agencies is in line with Biden’s directive on the healthy adoption of blockchain technology and digital assets. Furthermore, the Biden administration issued an executive order on cryptocurrency last year, which has been adopted by Congress unanimously.</p>
<p>In a bid to bring sanity to the crypto market, the joint federal regulators are concerned with the legal grey area where crypto assets operate. Furthermore, most crypto projects are developed on public ledgers without a legal framework to protect users.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the joint statement noted that banks are not prohibited from offering custodial or lending services.</p>
<p>“Banking organizations are neither prohibited nor discouraged from providing banking services to customers of any specific class or type, as permitted by law or regulation,” the joint statement <a href="https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2023/nr-ia-2023-1a.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reads</a>.</p>
<p>Notably, the United States regulatory agencies are concerned with the high crypto volatility, which exposes banks to unwarranted operational risks. Additionally, the agencies highlighted the inaccuracies of crypto projects, which in turn give misleading data.</p>
<p>“The agencies are continuing to assess whether or how current and proposed crypto-asset-related activities by banking organizations can be conducted in a manner that adequately addresses safety and soundness, consumer protection, legal permissibility, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including anti-money laundering and illicit finance statutes and rules,” the report noted.</p>
<p>The agencies also highlighted the challenges related to stablecoins and the ability of banking organizations to enact proper reserves. Furthermore, most of the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/news/crypto/blockchain-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blockchains</a> where stablecoins operate have unregulated governance, which may end up putting banks at risk of bad actors.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ripple-ceo-regulatory-clarity-us-2023/">Ripple CEO Holds High Hopes for Crypto Regulatory Clarity in US in 2023</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ripple-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ripple</a> CEO <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/brad-garlinghouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brad Garlinghouse</a> has said he is fairly optimistic about the United States crypto industry gaining regulatory clarity this year. He shared his thoughts via a series of Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1610352765129338880?t=MwwFWb-IACOe8VzAbKX6OQ&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">posts</a> on the first day of the 118th Congress.</p>
<h2>Ripple CEO Says Current Bills Give Hope</h2>
<p>In his commentaries, Garlinghouse noted that it is a good thing that the US would not be starting from scratch in its pursuit of regulatory clarity. The Ripple CEO noted that the US had something to work with in some of its bills including the Responsible Financial Innovation Act, the Securities Clarity Act, and the Clarity for Digital Tokens Act to mention a few.</p>
<p>Although he admits that no single bill can satisfy everyone&#8217;s expectations, nonetheless he believes that the existing bills already offer a good starting point for congressional debate. Thus, suggesting that there&#8217;s no need to delay any further in an attempt to create the so-called &#8220;perfect bill.&#8221;</p>
<p>Furthermore,  Garlinghouse spoke about how the US currently lags behind countries like Singapore, Brazil, and Japan, in terms of crypto regulations. While those countries have established frameworks for crypto regulation, the same cannot be said of the United States.</p>
<h2>Calls for Global Crypto Regulatory Standards</h2>
<p>For Garlinghouse,  there&#8217;s an urgent need for global regulators to come up with a common standard regarding the regulation of crypto. He believes that so far, the lack of cooperation and coordination by global regulators is bad for all. He says, the inconsistencies in regulations eventually force crypto businesses to countries with less-cumbersome regulations.  But not without leaving serious damaging effects on the industry.</p>
<p>Garlinghouse&#8217;s commentaries appear to be justified,  especially in light of recent events like the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ftx-exchange-files-for-bankruptcy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX collapse</a>.  Although the unfortunate incident has now suddenly aroused the interest of several lawmakers across the board. While some are clamoring for a clampdown on crypto, others ask for more robust regulations to ensure the safety of the business.  Nonetheless, it remains to be seen whether 2023 will become the defining year for global crypto regulation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/lightning-bitcoin-atms-australia/">Lightning-Enabled Bitcoin ATMs Go Live in Australia</a></p>
<p>In a recent development, the Australian city of Coolangatta <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/lightning-network-gets-physical-form-in-australia-with-bitcoin-atm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a> the launch of its first <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> ATM integrated with Lightning Network capabilities. Lightning Network is a Layer-2 scalability solution for Bitcoin and seeks to provide faster transactions at even reduced costs. The new Bitcoin ATM in Coolangatta has been installed at The Strand shopping center and is available for public use. Bitcoin Lightning ATMs will work similarly to normal Bitcoin ATMs but would be saving significant time due to the instant transaction capabilities of the Layer-2 network.</p>
<p>Besides, it would also facilitate the purchasing of very small amounts of Bitcoins to its lowest denomination of Satoshis. 1 satoshi equals 0.00000001 BTC.</p>
<p>As of now, Bitcoin ATMs settle transactions directly on the blockchain network. However, this has a few restrictions of its own. For e.g. operators need to adapt to batching transactions whenever the miner fees increase very sharply during the times of Bitcoin bull runs.</p>
<p>It means that whenever a user purchases Bitcoin through an ATM, they don&#8217;t receive them immediately. Operators have a process in place for waiting for users of other ATM networks to use the machines before grouping and sending out transactions for several users in one single bulk transaction. The use of Lightning Network can help to resolve this issue to a great extent.</p>
<h2>The Benefits of Lightning Bitcoin ATMs</h2>
<p>Using the Lightning Network, the transactions can be processed immediately since the operator doesn&#8217;t need to batch funds. As soon as the user inserts the cash, he/she would receive the payments via the Lightning Network.</p>
<p>However, there&#8217;s still some debate about whether the use of Lightning Network would lead to a significant drop in the fees. But at any given point, they would still be lower than on-chain payments. Australia is currently competing with El Salvador and seeks to become the fourth-largest Bitcoin ATM hub in the world. As we step into 2023, Australia has a total of 213 Bitcoin ATMs.</p>
<p>Despite the crypto winter, the installations of crypto ATMs worldwide have been increasing. As per data by Coin ATM Radar, the total number of crypto ATMs worldwide has reached 38,602. Out of this, 6,071 ATMs were installed last year in 2022 alone.</p>
