Conflux (CFX) has recently recorded a significant price rise following a few days of bearish movements. According to data from CoinMarketCap, CFX has gained by 11.39% in the last 24 hours, emerging as the day&#8217;s top gainer. So what&#8217;s driving this price gain? Bank of China Announces SIM Card NFC Payments, Sparks Excitement In The Conflux Community.  On July 10, The Bank of China announced it would be commencing the testing of SIM card-linked payments using the digital renminbi &#8211; known as digital yuan &#8211; starting from July 11- yesterday. According to its statement, the state-owned bank claims to be conducting this program in collaboration with telecommunications giants China Telecom and China Unicom.

Given this, it appears that some CFX fans believe the Conflux Network will play a significant role in the new SIM Card e-CNY payment system.  The excitement in the CFX community translated into positive price movement, with CFX surging by 11% this morning to hit a peak price of $0.2031. Prior to this price increase, CFX had seen its market price fall from $0.197 to as low as $0.175 over the last seven days.  At the time of writing, CFX is currently trading at $0.201 with a 0.20% loss in the last hour. However, the token’s trading volume has risen 135.79% and is valued at $75.4 million. With a market cap of $617.6 million, Conflux is ranked as the 67th biggest cryptocurrency on the market.
