<p>CNBC reported today that, an anonymous since the figures are private, <strong>claimed that about 60 positions had been cut. Currently, the business employs about 145 people.</strong></p>

<p>In the same week, Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini, criticized DCG CEO Barry Silbert on Monday for utilizing &#8220;<strong>bad faith stall tactics</strong>.&#8221; Winklevoss also accused DCG CEO Barry Silbert of abusing $1.675 billion in cash owing to Genesis by DCG for reasons other than repaying creditors.</p>



<p>Silbert reacted on Twitter, claiming that <strong>DCG never borrowed $1.675 billion from Genesis</strong> and is up to date on all outstanding debts.</p>

<p>Genesis was struck by the collapse of FTX and its sister hedge fund Alameda Research in the fall of 2022.</p>



<p>The magazine reported that <strong>Alameda received millions of dollars from Genesis before it collapsed.</strong> After Alameda went bankrupt, Genesis froze its client funds in November.</p>



<p>As mentioned in an earlier Coincu News article, thursday&#8217;s additional<strong> 30% staff cuts left Genesis with 145 employees</strong>. Before the previous layoffs in August, Genesis employed 260 people.</p>

<p>Genesis is one of many crypto companies trying to manage the aftermath as various interconnected parts of the industry go up in flames. Before Genesis froze all withdrawals,<strong> the company begged for a $1 billion emergency loan from investors</strong>.</p>



<p>These are the latest developments from Genesis after this lending unit was rumored to be insolvent when it blocked withdrawals from mid-November 2022, just a few days after FTX went bankrupt.</p>



<p>Not only that, even Genesis&#8217; parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), was also caught up in a spiral of crisis because of unclear internal transactions, which made this company insolvent.</p>

<p>After being accused of deliberately &#8220;buying time&#8221; to find an impossible way out, <strong>Genesis was sent an &#8220;ultimatum&#8221; by a $900 million creditor, Gemini, asking to come up with a solution by January 8.</strong></p>



<p>In response, the CEO of Genesis, in a letter to investors on January 4, stated that the company &#8220;<a href="https://news.coincu.com/158128-crypto-broker-genesis-ceo-needs-more-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">needs more time</a>&#8221; to handle the crisis.

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky is being sued by New York State Attorney General Letitia James for allegedly scamming investors of &#8220;billions of dollars&#8221; in cryptocurrency.</em></li>



<li><em>According to the Attorney General&#8217;s office, Mashinsky misrepresented low-risk investments and dependable lending partners.</em></li>



<li><em>The state of New York wants to forbid Mashinsky from conducting business there. He is also required to make restitution to investors and pay other penalties.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>Long after it filed for bankruptcy, crypto lender Celsius Network is still dealing with the effects of its turbulent 2022.</strong></h5>



<p><strong>Letitia</strong> <strong>James</strong>, the attorney general of New York State, has <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2023/attorney-general-james-sues-former-ceo-celsius-cryptocurrency-platform-defrauding" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed</a> a lawsuit against <a href="https://news.coincu.com/128513-alex-mashinsky-transferred-82-200-cel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alex Mashinsky</a>, the former CEO of the defunct cryptocurrency lender <strong>Celsius</strong> <strong>Network</strong>, for allegedly defrauding investors. </p>

<p><strong>Mashinsky</strong> is the latest disgraced executive to face legal repercussions following the collapse of the cryptocurrency market. The CEO allegedly <strong>deceived clients about Celsius&#8217; deteriorating financial situation while operating without registering as a salesperson or a dealer in commodities and securities.</strong></p>



<p>According to the Attorney General&#8217;s office, <strong>Mashinsky</strong> misrepresented low-risk investments and dependable lending partners while <strong>&#8220;routinely&#8221; subjecting investors to high-risk strategies</strong> that led to losses that the company&#8217;s CEO concealed from clients.</p>



<p>The lawsuit claims that he also misrepresented safety, tactics, and user numbers. Over <strong>26,000 investors</strong> in the state were allegedly duped by Celsius&#8217; former CEO, and James claims that <strong>some of them experienced &#8220;financial ruin.&#8221;</strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“As the former CEO of Celsius, Alex Mashinsky promised to lead investors to financial freedom but led them down a path of financial ruin. The law is clear that making false and unsubstantiated promises and misleading investors is illegal. Today, we are taking action on behalf of thousands of New Yorkers who were defrauded by Mr. Mashinsky to recoup their losses. My office will stay vigilant and ensure that bad actors trying to take advantage of New York investors are held accountable,&#8221; said Attorney General James.</p>

<p>The state of New York wants to forbid Mashinsky from conducting business there. Along with preventing him from running any businesses in New York state, it also wants him to pay investors back for losses and provide other forms of compensation.</p>



<p>According to a statement from <a href="https://news.coincu.com/128281-celsiuss-ceo-leaves-the-company-pay-debts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Celsius</a>, <strong>Mashinsky</strong> is no longer employed by the company and is not involved in its administration as of an announcement from <strong>September</strong> <strong>2022</strong>.</p>



<p>In a protracted bankruptcy proceeding involving the corporation in federal bankruptcy court, a judge <a href="https://news.coincu.com/158409-celsius-can-now-sell-assets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ruled</a> on Wednesday that digital assets of consumers kept in <strong>Earn</strong> <strong>accounts</strong> <strong>were considered the company&#8217;s property because of the terms of service.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>TON Storage, a decentralized file-sharing and data-storage service, was made public by the TON Foundation.</em></li>



<li><em>Similar to peer-to-peer file sharing via torrents, TON Storage uses the TON blockchain to share data over a private, secure, and decentralized computer network.</em></li>



<li><em>Users will be able to freely and securely trade files of any size in this fashion, with all data being automatically backed up and secured.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>The Open Network (TON) blockchain&#8217;s non-profit TON Foundation has introduced TON Storage, a decentralized file-sharing and data storage solution.</strong></h5>

<p><strong>TON</strong> <strong>Foundation</strong> is the guardian of the proof-of-stake blockchain <strong>TON</strong>, which was created by the founders of <strong>Telegram</strong> <strong>Messenger</strong>.</p>



<p>Torrent-based internet-based peer-to-peer file sharing is similar to how <strong>TON</strong> <strong>Storage</strong> operates. But rather than using centralized web servers, <strong>it uses the</strong> <strong>TON</strong> <strong>blockchain</strong> <strong>network</strong> <strong>to send data files of any size that are secured and backed up.</strong></p>



<p>However, consumers did not have any motivation to keep their data using torrents, and the longevity of the files was not guaranteed. By giving users incentives to operate nodes and host files, <strong>TON</strong> <strong>Storage</strong> seeks to change that.</p>

<p><strong>TON</strong> <strong>Foundation</strong> <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-ton-foundation-launches-ton-storage--a-next-generation-file-storage-solution-301713232.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> in a statement:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Anyone can become a node operator on the TON network and receive payments from other users for hosting files — even if operating just one node. The accessibility of this new product will incentivize new, independent users to join the TON network, helping to grow the TON ecosystem even further.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Additionally, <strong>TON Storage</strong> effectively integrates with <strong>TON</strong> <strong>Sites</strong> and <strong>TON</strong> <strong>DNS</strong> to allow sites to begin on the <strong>TON</strong> <strong>Network</strong> <strong>without needing a fixed IP address</strong>, a centralized domain, or a licensed centralized center. Without the need for a web server, <strong>TON Storage can host TON Sites</strong>. This completes the final puzzle piece needed for the <a href="https://news.coincu.com/147857-the-ton-foundation-has-market-relief-fund/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TON Foundation</a> to create a completely decentralized internet.</p>

Last month, <strong>Telegram</strong> <a href="https://news.coincu.com/150150-telegram-users-use-blockchain-based-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> a new upgrade that allows users to register accounts with blockchain-based anonymous numbers rather than mobile phone numbers.</p>

<p><strong>Superscrypt, Circle Ventures, Coinbase Ventures</strong>, and <strong>Shima Capital</strong> were among the investors in the round for the multi-signature wallet technology, which was established in <strong>July</strong> of last year. The money will go toward expanding MSafe&#8217;s staff, expanding its line of products, and speeding up product uptake.</p>



<p>More than a dozen of the top Move-based projects on Aptos has already integrated with <strong>MSafe</strong> for treasury management, smart contract deployment, and blockchain protocol administrative control. This integration was spearheaded by <strong>CEO</strong> <strong>Wendy Fu</strong>, a former member of Meta&#8217;s Diem project and a founding member of <a href="https://news.coincu.com/104906-meta-decided-to-shutter-novi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Novi</a> wallet, and <strong>CTO Jacky Wang</strong>, a former senior core-protocol developer at <a href="https://news.coincu.com/137671-harmony-chooses-layer-zero-restore-bridge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harmony</a>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We created MSafe with a mission to provide more secure and decentralized financial services to scale digital assets management and transaction on-chain. Starting with the multi-sig non-custodial wallet, we aspire to be a one-stop destination for institutions, enterprises, and individuals to manage and grow their digital assets,&#8221; said Wendy Fu.</p>

<p>On a regular basis, the assets on the platform will filter well-liked assets for off-the-shelf and off-the-shelf agglomeration exchanges, as well as make improvements such as on-chain and global rankings. The security team has steadily reduced the pooled market-making funds on the platform to safeguard the security of the funds of the many Pionex users, as <strong>Huobi Exchange&#8217;s trading popularity on the platform has gradually declined in recent months</strong>, according to the announcement.</p>



<p>The security team has been enhancing the API architecture over the past year in addition to making ongoing improvements to the financial products and bots of the deployment network. This has helped <strong>the Pionex network become less dependent on Binance and Huobi</strong>, allowed for the introduction of third-party market makers, and increased transaction depth.</p>

<p>The capital used to create Huobi&#8217;s market has been fully withdrawn from the distribution network today, and third-party market maker partners provide the transaction depth of the applicable currency pair.</p>



<p>The<strong> &#8220;cautious&#8221;</strong> and<strong> &#8220;solid&#8221;</strong> market strategy and product development strategy that <strong>Pionex</strong> has been pursuing has avoided many black swan incidents in the industry and has had no impact on the platform during these events, which have included the <strong>Luna</strong> death spiral, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/157878-sam-bankman-fried-pleads-not-guilty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX</a> misappropriation of customer funds, and the recent intensification of borrower interests related to <strong>Genesis</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Clearpool</strong> <strong>Prime</strong>, which is scheduled to go operational in <strong>Q1</strong>, will allow institutions to borrow and lend digital assets on a large scale in a safe, legal environment while also providing market players with liquidity and competitive pricing.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>In order to enable institutions to borrow cryptoassets without over-collateralization, <strong>Robert</strong> <strong>Alcorn</strong>, a former trader at an investment bank, and <strong>Alessio</strong> <strong>Quaglini</strong>, CEO of <strong>Hex</strong> <strong>Trust</strong>, established <strong>Clearpool</strong> in <strong>June</strong> <strong>2021</strong>.</p>



<p>Since overcollateralization is exceedingly capital inefficient, institutional borrowers prefer unsecured debt, which makes up the vast bulk of the world&#8217;s debt. Therefore, while the current huge overcollateralized lending protocols (i.e. <a href="https://news.coincu.com/155188-aave-to-launch-public-testnet-gho/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AAVE</a>, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/151408-makerdao-execute-eight-governance-proposal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MakerDAO</a>, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/148190-compound-proposed-increase-weth-supply/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Compound</a>) make sense for individual, pseudonymous users, they do not work for larger borrowers who need to have options for uncollateralized borrowing in order to truly be driven to come on-chain.</p>



<p>By developing the first dynamic marketplace for uncollateralized institutional liquidity, <strong>Clearpool</strong> is meeting this demand. It offers these larger players the choice of borrowing from large, liquid pools of crypto-native capital or receiving higher risk-adjusted returns and lower counterparty risk on the money they lend out, as well as programmability, flexibility, transparency, and reduced execution, brokerage, underwriting, and sales/marketing time and costs.</p>

<p>The introduction of Clearpool&#8217;s first permissioned pool in collaboration with <strong>Jane Street </strong>and <strong>BlockTower</strong> last year signals the advancement of institutional pools to the next stage, which is represented by the Prime marketplace.</p>



<p>The need for compliant access to <a href="https://news.coincu.com/157319-defi-a-promising-piece-p1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DeFi</a> has increased since that time. The development of decentralized capital markets will be supported and facilitated by <strong>Prime</strong>, which was developed, tested, and audited to fulfill institutional needs.</p>

<p><strong>Marcus</strong> is of the opinion that the reluctance of regulators will last through <strong>the year 2023</strong>, and that the development of clear crypto rules would take <strong>&#8220;many years.&#8221;</strong></p>



<p>David Marcus is <strong>the creator of the Bitcoin payments business Lightspark</strong>. Prior to that, he served as the president of PayPal and as the vice president of Messenger Products at Meta. Marcus was also a co-founder of <strong>Meta&#8217;s Diem project,</strong> which was once known as Facebook but was ultimately scrapped.</p>



<p>The former Paypal&#8217;s President is of the opinion that the cryptocurrency market will require &#8220;<strong>several years</strong>&#8221; before it can recover from &#8220;<strong>a bad year 2022 </strong>from the unscrupulous people that wrecked the market and for the appropriate regulations to come into play in the years to come.&#8221;</p>

<p>It began with the downfall of<strong> the LUNA-UST empire</strong>, and was then followed by the collapse of the investment fund <strong>Three Arrows Capital (3AC)</strong>, the lending company Voyager Digital and Celsius Network, and most recently,<strong> the shocking downfall of FTX</strong>. Because the failure of these institutions has an effect on millions of customers, it can take several years for the market to rebuild the faith of its customers.</p>



<p>In the end, Marcus anticipates significant breakthroughs in a variety of fields, including <strong>Payment, DeFi, Zero-knowledge applications</strong>, including proof of reserve and Layer 1 scaling solutions, etc., among other things.</p>

<p>The <strong>Timeless</strong> <strong>Bunni</strong> <strong>liquidity</strong> <strong>engine</strong>, which aims to increase liquidity on <strong>Uniswap</strong> <strong>v3</strong>, is built around <strong>LIT</strong>. By introducing <strong>LIT</strong>, the protocol aspires to make it possible for other projects to reward the liquidity of their tokens with capital efficiency orders of magnitude higher than at present. In order to boost liquidity for the <strong>Timeless</strong> <strong>yield</strong> <strong>markets</strong>, it also intends to use <strong>LIT</strong> itself.</p>



<p>In <strong>October 2022</strong>, <strong>Bunni</strong> was first made available as a public utility, reflecting <strong>Uniswap</strong> <strong>v3</strong> <strong>liquidity</strong> positions as fungible<strong> ERC-20 tokens</strong> rather than <strong>NFTs</strong>. Since <strong>ERC-20 tokens</strong> are simpler to work with, it makes it possible to create incentivization plans that are more complicated for <strong>Uniswap</strong> <strong>v3</strong> <strong>liquidity</strong>.</p>
