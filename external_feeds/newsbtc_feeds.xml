					<description><![CDATA[Ethereum developers have taken measures to address the finality issues that occurred on the Beacon chain in the past week. On May 11 and May 12, the Beacon chain, the consensus layer of the Ethereum network, was unable to reach finality on two occasions. The first occurrence lasted for 25 minutes, and the second for over an hour.  Although the exact cause of such an incident is yet unknown, it is worth stating that this network glitch had no impact on on-chain activity and transactions were still processed.  Related Reading: Tether Holds $3.4 Billion In Gold Reserves, Nears ATH Market Cap 1 Year Post Terra Collapse Ethereum Developers Roll Out Network Patches To Tackle Finality Challenge  In response to the past week, Ethereum developers have released patches to provide a solution for network users. According to a tweet by Beacom Chain community health analyst superphiz, Teku and Prysm, two of Ethereum&#8217;s constitutional clients, have implemented these fixes, which will help prevent further finality issues on the Beacon chain.  Superphiz also shared a statement from the Ethereum Foundation in which they are speculating the cause of these “exceptional scenarios” to be the “high load of some Consensus Layer clients”.  The Ethereum Foundation applauded client diversity which made it feasible for transactions to occur on the network, as not all client implementations were affected by the finality challenges. The Ethereum Foundation also confirmed that the exact cause of the Beacon chain glitch is still unknown. However, they provided assurances that the upgrades implemented by Teku and Prsym would help avoid future occurrences via optimizations that will prevent beacon nodes from high resource usage during these situations.  Related Reading: BRISE Gains 21% In 24 Hours – Could This Be A Market Recovery?

					<description><![CDATA[KAVA, the utility token of decentralized blockchain Kava, has been on a strong bullish trend in the last few days. The cryptocurrency maintained this momentum despite the bearish market sentiment in the past week, garnering an impressive 31% price gain. To end what was a largely positive week, a proposal to initiate the first phase of Kava Horizon was submitted by the Layer-1 ecosystem. Related Reading: BRISE Gains 21% In 24 Hours – Could This Be A Market Recovery? KAVA Price Overview Recently, the KAVA token has been on a positive price rally, gaining more than 30% of its value in the last seven days. For long-term investors, this may be seen as some form of recovery, as the coin had not been performing well until a week ago. To put this into perspective, the token has only increased by 1.6% in the past month. In fact, up until the 8th of May, the price of KAVA was on a steady decline, losing nearly 29% of its value in three weeks. That said, an upward price movement that started a week ago has seen the token climb up to its previous high of $0.96. As of this writing, KAVA is valued at $0.969, tallying a 4.7% increase in 24 hours.  KAVAUSD trading at $0.9754 &#124; Source: KAVAUSD chart from TradingView This latest price increase has been linked to the upcoming upgrade on the mainnet. Scheduled for 17th May, 2023 (15:00 UTC), the “Kava 13” upgrade aims to bring architectural enhancements to the security, scalability, and functionality of the network. Consequently, this will help developers to scale and accelerate their protocols and improve user experience across the ecosystem. According to CoinGecko data, KAVA has a market capitalization of $495.5 million, which places it as the 90th largest cryptocurrency in the market. It is, however, worth noting that the token’s daily trading volume has dipped by 51.7% to $21.9 million in the last 24 hours. Kava Submits Proposal To Initiate &#8216;Horizon&#8217; On May 13, 2023, Kava advanced its plans to implement the first phase of the Kava Horizon. Codenamed “Proposal 141”, the proposal to initiate this change is now live for community voting. This proposal, if approved, will permanently end all emissions (including POS rewards, Rise rewards, grants, and other reward emissions) by December 31, 2023.  However, before this is implemented, two independent foundations will be created to oversee the steady development and maintenance of the permissionless and decentralized blockchain. These two foundations will receive the bulk of emissions till they eventually cease at the end of the year.  A future software upgrade &#8211; launched subsequent to proposal 141 &#8211; will control the flow of all accumulated rewards from the aforementioned foundations.  Related Reading: Tether Holds $3.4 Billion In Gold Reserves, Nears ATH Market Cap 1 Year Post Terra Collapse Featured image from Securities.io, chart from TradingView]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[While the global crypto market capitalization has plunged in the past week, with most coins trading in the red, Bitcoin SV (BSV) bucked the bears. BSV has scored 10% price gains on the weekly chart. The coin gained 2.47% on the last day, showing a 0.57% price increase in the previous hour. With today’s performance, Bitcoin SV joined the list of top-performing coins over the past timeframe and might be nearing $40. Bitcoin SV Back In The Spotlight Bitcoin SV was created in 2018 due to a hard fork from Bitcoin Cash led by the controversial Craig Wright. The idea was to create a blockchain that could process transactions faster with a larger block size limit, a major bottleneck for Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin.  In addition, BSV has incorporated Ethereum-like capabilities such as native tokens, smart contracts, and other features to ensure interoperability within its blockchain. However, the token has failed to gain the sort of adoption it envisaged and hit an all-time low on May 8, bottoming at $29.17. But a series of events in the Bitcoin ecosystem has made the controversial token jump into the limelight.  Related Reading: Coinbase Engages Legal And Political Aids In Battling SEC Top among these is the congestion on the Bitcoin network caused by Ordinals NFT and BRC-20 tokens. Bitcoin SV supporters believe its high transaction throughput and low transaction fees make it a better blockchain than Bitcoin, and the numbers support it. Currently, the average transaction fee on BSV is about $0.035, while average Bitcoin fees have spiked to $31.50 as more users jump on the BRC-20 token trend. This has led to a debate in the Bitcoin community, with advocates for increasing the block size growing louder.  This move has been rebuffed by core Bitcoin maximalists who believe that increasing this capacity would lead to greater centralization – As fewer people can run a node that operates using higher bandwidth. This could be Bitcoin SV’s gain as proponents believe it could provide an excellent alternative and fulfil llSatoshi Nakamoto’s dream of a peer-to-peer electronic money system as outlined in the original Bitcoin whitepaper.  Related Reading: Ripple CTO Labels BEN Coin As Scam, Bitboy Reacts Bitcoin SV Price Analysis  At the time of writing, Bitcoin SV is trading at $35.98, and if the bullish momentum continues, BSV could target $40 in the coming days. However, before reaching the $40 target, Bitcoin SV bulls may encounter an intermediate hurdle in the $37-$39 range.   However, before reaching the $0.60 target, the bulls may encounter an intermediate hurdle in the $0.57 to $0.58 range. The SMA 20 is in the buy zone, which could indicate that investors are looking to accumulate more of the token, which is a bullish sign. In the event of a decline, substantial support is anticipated at $32.  -Featured Image from iStock, charts from TradingView]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The largest crypto exchange in the US, Coinbase, has made a notable move regarding the allegation from the US Securities and Exchange Commission on securities law violation.  Related Reading: PEPE Attempts Market Rebound, Surges By 28% In 24 Hours Coinbase engaged a Global Advisory Council for the battle with the SEC. The council comprises heavy hitters from both the political and legal sectors. Coinbase Gets Heavyweights In Its Council The Coinbase crypto exchange announced the launch of a new Global Advisory Council, with some former US lawmakers as members.  According to the announcement, the Council will offer insights and business strategies for the exchange. The Advisory Council includes political heavyweights like former Congressman Tim Ryan (D-OH) and former Senator Patrick Toomey (R-PA).  Also, the Council includes former Congressman Sean Patrick Maloney (D-NY), John Anzalone from Impact Research, and Chris Lehane from Haun Ventures. The Council will work closely with Coinbase Asset Management Academic and Regulatory Advisory Council members. Similarly, the Coinbase body comprises prominent personalities such as former SEC Chair Jay Clayton and former CIA General Counsel Courtney Elwood. Related Reading: Lido (LDO) Surges 16% In Single Day, Maintains Dominance In Liquid Staking Market Others are the senior managing director at Compass Lexecon Jon Orszag and Kevin Hassett of the Hoover Institution. Coinbase noted that creating the Advisory Council is a step in the right direction for the company. It would help the exchange to maintain a flawless operation process while rebuilding its strategies in the US and globally.  Coinbase is currently in a legal face-off with the SEC. So, engaging a new council is part of its preparatory strategies. Coinbase Prepares To Fight With The SEC Notably, the US SEC has toughened its regulatory stance in the crypto industry and is now closely watching most crypto-related firms. In one of its enforcement actions, the SEC issued a Wells Notice to Coinbase in March, warning the company of a possible lawsuit over alleged breaches of securities.  Reacting to the notice, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong noted that the regulator is focusing its accusations on staking and asset listing. He recalled that the SEC had reviewed the exchange’s operations and approved its license in the past. Armstrong stated that they requested a reasonable explanation from the SEC. According to the CEO, the firm intended to use the reply for rulemaking to maintain the right regulatory requirements for crypto assets. However, the SEC gave no response to the exchange&#8217;s request. Further, Paul Grewal, the Chief Legal Officer of Coinbase, expressed disappointment over the SEC’s preference for lawsuits to constructive dialoguing.  He noted that despite all their efforts to work with the SEC, the regulator gave them no feedback. Grewal stated that Coinbase would defend the rule of law if the SEC initiated a legal battle. -Featured image: Pexels, Chart: TradingView]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ripple&#8217;s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), David Schwartz, responded to a tweet from a crypto enthusiast, calling the BEN Coin project a 100% rug pull. Schwartz asked the poster why he believed such but still stated his reservations about the new crypto project.  So many crypto coins launch daily in the market. However, scam projects and rug pulls also deceive unsuspecting customers into investing. Related Reading: PEPE Attempts Market Rebound, Surges By 28% In 24 Hours A rug pull is a crypto scam where the project founder suddenly withdraws the project&#8217;s liquidity, disappearing with investor funds. This leads to a sharp price drop and losses for investors. David Schwartz Expresses Reservations About BEN Coin A crypto enthusiast believes the BEN coin project was a 100% rug pull. Reacting to the tweet, Schwartz asked the user if he believed the rug pull would occur in the future or if Bitboy&#8217;s involvement in the project was a rug pull. Schwartz further concluded that he believed one of those scenarios. Do you mean that the rug will be pulled in the future? Or do you mean that Bitboy joining the team is itself a rug pull? Because one of those things I definitely agree with. &#8212; David &#34;JoelKatz&#34; Schwartz (@JoelKatz) May 10, 2023 However, the popular crypto influencer Ben Armstrong, &#8221;Bitboy&#8221;,  reacted to these allegations stating that they are products of ignorance and hate. He further explained that he is a force to reckon with in the crypto space, participating in projects that affected over 99% of the community. Also, he explained that his company employs over 40 people. According to Armstrong, he has produced two videos daily in the past five years, a testament to his commitment to educating the crypto community.  Bitboy asked the crypto community to stop believing memes that can create a negative impression. Also, in another tweet, Armstrong informed his followers that he was taking over the BEN coin project. He also agrees with @eth_ben, a Twitter user, that BEN coin&#8217;s liquidity and assets will be transferred to him in a week. Notably, BitBoy stated earlier that the coin was launched to serve as the governance token for his DAO. Also, the BEN token launched and traded for two days before BitBoy announced its existence.  How Is BEN Token Faring Today? The token is gaining massive traction on the chart today as bulls seem to control the current scenario. It indicates price volatility for the asset in the bullish direction. Although BEN is relatively new, it has formed several highs and lows on the price chart as market forces act on its price.

					<description><![CDATA[BRISE, the native token of the Bitgert blockchain, has recorded some significant positive price movement in the last 24 hours. Although the BRC-20 token is still trading in the red zone, it appears to be attempting a market recovery following this sudden hike in its market value. BRISE: Biggest Gainer In Top 200 Coin Roster According to data by CoinMarketCap, BRISE has soared by 21.44% over the last day, making it the largest gainer among the Top 200 cryptocurrencies in the market, followed closely by the meme season diamond &#8211; Pepecoin.  This price movement has produced much excitement within the Bitgert community as the BRISE token has been in a bearish state for quite some time, recording significant losses.  Data from CoinMarketCap shows that BRISE had lost 3.09% and 26.07% of its value in the last seven and 30 days, respectively.  Related Reading: PEPE, DOGE, SHIB See Fierce Competition From New FETH Token BRISE opened its weekly market around a price region of $0.0000003534 and exhibited a steady decline over the next few days before finding support around a market price of $0.0000002759 on May 12. Thereafter, BRISE began to show signs of consolidation before finally experiencing a price surge yesterday morning to trade as high as $0.0000003781. Although Bitgert’s native token has slipped from such price heights, the decline has been insignificant, and BRISE appears to be gathering momentum for another price breakout.  Interestingly, shortly after the BRC-20 token’s surge, Bitgert’s developer team announced a supply burn of 500 billion BRISE tokens, which had drawn more interest to the asset as token burns are usually associated with price rises.  At the time of writing, BRISE is trading at $0.0000003514 with a 0.4% gain in the last hour. The token’s daily trading volume is up 6.99%, valued at $9.71 million. With a circulation supply of 395.68 trillion tokens, Birget&#8217;s native coin boasts a market cap value of $139.5 million.  BRISE Trading At $0.00000035258 &#124; Source: BRISEUSD Chart on Tradingview.com Related Reading: PayPal Plunging Despite Increasing Crypto Holdings Could A BRISE Recovery Be On?

					<description><![CDATA[Tether (USDT), the world’s largest stablecoin by market capitalization, was one of the dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies to have been affected by the collapse of the Terra ecosystem. Now &#8211; a year later, the stablecoin has reclaimed its stable dollar peg and boasts one of the deepest reserves in the cryptocurrency industry. Related Reading: Tether Smashes Records, $1.48 Billion Profit In Q1- Surplus Over Reserves Hits All-Time High Prominent Crypto Figure Dubs Tether A &#8216;Precious Metals Powerhouse&#8217;   Gabor Gurbacs, on Friday, May 12, provided an insight into the significance of precious metals to Tether’s financial setup. Interestingly, Gurbacs, the founder of PointsVille, dubbed Tether’s USDT a “precious metals powerhouse”. According to Gurbacs’ tweet, Tether Holdings Limited, the issuer of the USDT stablecoin, has placed substantial importance on gold, forging a solid reputation in the industry. His tweet also reveals that USDT, the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has a staggering sum of roughly $3.4 billion in reserves held in gold. In the same breath, Gurbacs noted that approximately $500 million backs the circulating supply of Tether Gold (XAUT), Tether’s gold-pegged stablecoin. Furthermore, the amount of gold in Tether reserves far outweighs that of Bitcoin (BTC), which stands at about $1.5 billion.  From Gubarcs’ perspective, the diversity of the USDT reserves &#8211; which consists of gold, cash, corporate bonds, BTC, etc. &#8211; helps protect the stablecoin against potential market collapses and unexpected negative events. Considering his advisory role within the firm, it may be fair to consider Gubarcs’ analysis of Tether’s financial strategy as an insider viewpoint.  Terra Collapse &#8211; One Year Later In one of the most catastrophic events in the crypto industry, the Terra ecosystem collapsed in May 2022, with its UST stablecoin losing its dollar peg. The ripple effect saw investors lose faith in most dollar-backed assets, including Tether USD. This caused the panic sale of these dollar-backed assets. As a result, Tether’s dollar peg broke momentarily, with the token falling as low as 92 cents at times. Furthermore, two months after the Terra collapse, Tether’s market capitalization had dropped by roughly $16 billion to $65 billion, an indication of massive withdrawals by token holders. While this unfortunate event was an unexpected test of USDT’s resilience and stablecoins, as an entity, many would agree with the fact that Tether passed the test resoundingly. After all, USDT regained its dollar peg only two months after the crash. Meanwhile, in terms of market capitalization, USDT has made a robust recovery since. In fact, USDT’s market cap currently stands at $82.9 billion, according to data from CoinGecko. This means that the stablecoin is now more than ever closer to its all-time high market cap of $83 billion.

					<description><![CDATA[The crypto market has been looking to consolidate following a major price correction earlier in the week. One market that has felt the brunt of this correction is BRC-20 token which has suffered a major dip in its market cap.  According to brc-20.io, which tracks the nascent market for tokens minted on the Bitcoin blockchain, the market cap of all BRC-20 tokens between May 8 and 11 went from $990,000,000 to $379,000,000, a 62% drop. At the time of writing, the market cap of BRC-20 tokens has rebounded and is around $570,000,000, making it a 40% dip within the seven-day trading period.  Related Reading: Bakkt Streamlines Apex Crypto Platform By Removing 25 Tokens The BRC-20 market is largely tied to the capitalization of ORDI token, which dominates more than 80% of the trading volumes. At the time of writing, it is currently trading around $15, down from its all-time high price of $28, achieved earlier in the month. The importance of ORDI in this market means that price variations directly and considerably affect the market cap of BRC-20 tokens.  &#160; A Deep Dive Into BRC-20 Token  BRC-20 is an experimental standard for issuing and transferring fungible tokens on the Bitcoin network. The deployment, issuance, and transfer of these tokens is done via a JSON data entry. Hence its relationship with the NFT Ordinals of Bitcoin.  The creation of this standard is credited to a developer known as Domo on Twitter. On March 8, the computer scientist announced his progress in this area and acknowledged that it would be difficult for him to take this test further. For this reason, he preferred to share the project with others to experiment with. Since then, the ecosystem has exploded, with more than 14.000 tokens launched, according to brc-20.io. Although the name BRC-20 is a reference to Ethereum&#8217;s ERC-20 standard. However, both standards differ in several of their characteristics, especially due to the differences between the networks in which they work, Bitcoin and Ethereum. First of all, Bitcoin&#8217;s BRC-20 tokens do not have the ability to interact with smart contracts, while ERC-20s do. Other limitations of the BRC-20 tokens compared to those of Ethereum is that they cannot have decimals, be burned or frozen, and have additional functions such as approval or delegation.

Nevertheless, proponents of this token standard argue that it expands the Bitcoin blockchain to new possibilities and provides new use cases for the leading cryptocurrency.  -Featured Image from iStock, charts from brc-20.io and Tradingview]]></description>

This allows FETH to develop a loyal and dedicated community that will ensure consistent returns for holders. Furthermore, it is the first meme-based token to also give out PEPE rewards &#8211; a coin that has rapidly grown to become the third-largest meme coin in the world.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The meme coin space has long been dominated by the likes of DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE, but now a new entrant into the space has signaled a shift in the market. <a href="https://ethfurbo.wtf/" rel="nofollow">ETH Furbo (FETH)</a> is an Ethereum-based token that gives PEPE reflections to all holders regardless of how much they hold. This means that while investors are earning significant returns on their FETH holdings, they’re also earning PEPE which means they are getting double the profits.</p>
