			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brett Harrison, the former president of FTX US, came under the spotlight after sharing details about his role at FTX US and his relationship with Sam Bankman-Fried.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harrison claimed that he knew nothing about potentially fraudulent activity at the company and that he initially believed working at FTX to be a &#8220;dream job.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, several people</span> <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickEBoyle/status/1614474414262976512" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">questioned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the details of Harrison&#8217;s account of the FTX drama. Specifically, they point to an FDIC cease and desist letter to Harrison, which alleges that</span> <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/news/press-releases/2022/ftx-harrison-letter.pdf?source=govdelivery&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he falsely claimed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that FTX US deposits were insured.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FDIC says that this could have caused harm to depositors. Moreover, his critics say that he</span> <a href="https://twitter.com/awesomerobis/status/1614506162216669189" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">must have known</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that they were not insured.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, Harrison&#8217;s FTX revelations come as he launches his own crypto venture. He already found backers, including Anthony Scaramucci, a financier and former Trump staffer with ties to FTX.</span></p>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a lengthy Twitter thread, Harrison explained that he had a</span><a href="https://twitter.com/BrettHarrison88/status/1614371358519042051" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">falling out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Bankman-Fried, which led him to resign.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harrison, who had known SBF while working at the quantitative trading firm</span><a href="https://twitter.com/BrettHarrison88/status/1614371365531836416" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Jane Street</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, said SFB completely changed character as an FTX CEO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His former student at Jane Street, whom he described as a &#8220;sensitive and intellectually curious person&#8221; who loved animals, later showed “total insecurity and intransigence” when anyone questioned his decisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Harrison, the former conscientious junior trader was later prone to respond with “dysregulated hostility,” “gaslighting,” and manipulation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also alleges that his former colleague threatened to destroy his professional reputation if he did not follow. Harrison</span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/ftx-president-brett-harrison-steps-down-2022-09-27" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">left the company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on September 27, 2022, and started working on his crypto venture.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eight weeks after his resignation, FTX, FTX US, and Alameda Research went bankrupt. Weeks later, the Department of Justice charged Bankman-Fried with money laundering and wire fraud.</span></p>

			<h2><b>Harrison Claims He Knew Nothing of Fraud &#8211; Critics Question His Account</b></h2>

		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harrison attempted to distance himself from the fraud charges against SBF. He said that it is &#8220;clear&#8221; that the fraud was &#8220;held closely by Sam and his inner circle at FTX. com and Alameda.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I never could have guessed that underlying these kinds of issues,&#8221; Harrison said, &#8220;was multi-billion-dollar fraud.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, some people criticized his account of the story. Hedge fund manager and finance professor Patrick Boyle</span> <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickEBoyle/status/1614474414262976512" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Harrison omitted one detail in his explanation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Brett doesn&#8217;t mention or explain why he announced on Twitter on July 20th that deposits on FTX are stored in FDIC-insured accounts in the user&#8217;s name. He must have (should have) known at the time that this was untrue,” Boyle said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The allegations come from a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) cease and desist letter to Harrison. The FDIC letter states that Harrison made statements on his professional Twitter account saying that</span><a href="https://www.fdic.gov/news/press-releases/2022/ftx-harrison-letter.pdf?source=govdelivery&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">consumer deposits benefited from deposit insurance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FTX also identified itself as “FDIC insured,” the complaint wrote. These statements were “false and misleading,” according to the FDIC, Moreover, they were “likely to mislead, and potentially harm customers.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FTX US depositors did not benefit from deposit insurance, FDIC said. Only deposits in registered banks did. This is why, after the FTX US bankruptcy, depositors could not access their funds. They are likely to lose everything.</span></p>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harrison did not address the FDIC complaint. Instead, he went on to focus on his </span><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/former-ftx-executive-brett-harrison-in-talks-with-investors-for-new-crypto-startup" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crypto venture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a crypto trading software for large investors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While acknowledging that his role in FTX&#8217;s collapse made raising money more difficult, he found at least one backer. Anthony Scaramucci, a </span><a href="https://dailycoin.com/anthony-scaramucci-ftx-ties-wall-street-to-crypto/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">financier with close ties to FTX</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, said he would invest in Harrison’s venture. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scaramucci may have played an important role in providing SBF with the connections he needed to establish FTX as a trusted player. Moreover, FTX invested millions in Scaramucci SkyBridge Capital. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a recent interview, Scaramucci said that he once </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sam-bankman-fried-compared-to-bernie-madoff-by-anthony-scaramucci-2023-1" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">considered SBF a friend</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He also saw his fraud as a personal betrayal, which SBF would go to the “ninth circle of Hell” for. Scaramucci’s relationship with Harrison is still intact. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s important to pick up and fight for your friends especially when they have had setbacks. Don’t walk away; be there and they will never forget,” Scaramucci</span><a href="https://twitter.com/Scaramucci/status/1614775465809674240" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">tweeted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shortly after announcing the investment in Harrison’s crypto project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FDIC complaint and his choice of backers raise some questions about Harrison’s role at FTX. </span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silvergate, the crypto-focused bank, announced on Tuesday that it experienced a $1 billion net loss attributable to common shareholders in the fourth quarter of 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a </span><a href="http://sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1312109/000131210923000020/ex991si4q22earningsrelease.htm" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Silvergate said that it also saw “significant” outflows of deposits. The average customer deposit in the fourth quarter of 22 was $7.3 billion, down from $12 billion in the third quarter of the same year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silvergate said that the main reason for the outflows was a “crisis of confidence” that the crypto industry is currently experiencing. The bank said that events like the bankruptcy of FTX, together with lower digital asset prices in general, made investors shift to a “risk off” position.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Silvergate still believes in the crypto industry. The bank’s CEO Allan Lane said that the company remains “focused” and maintains a” highly liquid balance sheet”.</span></p>
<pre><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>“While we are taking decisive actions to navigate the current environment, our mission has not changed. We believe in the digital asset industry, and we remain focused on providing value-added services for our core institutional customers. To that end, we are committed to maintaining a highly liquid balance sheet with a strong capital position,”</strong> he said.</span></pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decisive actions Lane is referring to included wholesale funding and the sale of debt securities to accommodate “sustained lower deposit levels”. On top of that, Silvergate cut its workforce by around 40% or 200 employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silvergate is also managing its expense base and evaluating its product portfolio and customer relationships going forward.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SkyBridge Capital managing partner Anthony Scaramucci has opened up about his relationship with Sam Bankman-Fried after the collapse of FTX.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking at Davos, Scaramucci said that he believed Bankman-Fried, also known as SBF, to be someone other than who he turned out to be. He compared SBF to the infamous Ponzi scammer Bernie Madoff.</span></p>
<pre><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>“I thought Sam was the Mark Zuckerberg of crypto, I didn’t think he was the Bernie Madoff of crypto,”</strong> Scaramucci said.</span></pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scaramucci also said that he felt “betrayed” by SBF, professionally and personally, since he had a close relationship with him and his family. He said that SBF has a place waiting for him in hell.</span></p>
<pre><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>“If anybody here has read Dante Alighieri’s Inferno, you know what the ninth circle of hell is reserved for. It’s for the betrayal of a friend who lives with the devil – the ninth circle of hell on the frozen lake,”</strong> he said.</span></pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FTX was an investor in Scaramucci’s SkyBridge Capital. FTX Ventures bought a 30% stake in the company in September of last year, just two months before FTX went bankrupt. SkyBridge is now trying to buy back FTX’s stake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the failed relationship with SBF, Scaramucci said he’ll probably make a similar mistake in the future because he’s a “risk taker.”</span></p>
<pre><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>“I’m a high-profile person so my mistakes get wildly magnified, [which is] totally fine but I’m not gonna stop the risk-taking,”</strong> he said.</span></pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Scaramucci seems to have already made another risky bet. Reports indicate that he invested in a crypto company that former FTX US president Brett Harrison started.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emerging out of the blue nearly a month ago, the Solana-based canine memecoin <a href="https://dailycoin.com/bonk-bonk-project-review-recent-developments-future-events-community/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bonk (BONK)</a> had a wild ride since its launch. Thanks to <a href="https://dailycoin.com/bonk-nft-collection-on-magic-eden-sells-out/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="noopener noreferrer">quick adoption by Solana’s community</a>, Bonk had a supersonic bull run with a 4424% increase just one week after launch. The sky-high interest in the newly-bred dog-themed crypto came after the developers airdropped half of the total supply to the SOL blockchain community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, cryptocurrency data aggregator <em>CoinGecko</em> revealed that BONK managed to triple its market price just eight days after launch, which is at the speed of light c<a href="https://dailycoin.com/bonk-bonk-slips-18-percent-despite-solana-sol-topping-shiba-inu-shib/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="noopener noreferrer">ompared to Shiba Inu’s (SHIB)</a> 141 days. Ultimately, if the tenacious bullish trend persists, the Solana savior can become a steady competitor in the current dog race between Shiba Inu and Dogecoin (DOGE).</span></p>

			<p>The World Economic Forum (WEF), in partnership with Accenture and Microsoft, has unveiled a working prototype of its metaverse venture. It is known as <em>The Global Collaboration Village</em> and was revealed at the WEF Annual meeting in Davos.</p>
<p>To use the metaverse and its technology for the public good, the World Economic Forum aims to encourage dialogue, among other initiatives, with the upcoming project.</p>
<p>The metaverse village will reportedly be built using Microsoft’s in-house technology to target 2D and 3D mediums. Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairperson of the WEF, hopes the village will set the foundation for a borderless collaborative space.</p>

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>In a press conference on January 17th, founder and executive chairperson of the WEF, Klaus Schwab, CEO of Accenture, Julie Sweet, and Vice-Chair President of Microsoft, Brad Smith, shared their insight on the Global Collaboration Village.</p>
<p>The WEF founder explained that the Global Collaboration Village is a “pioneering” effort to use the metaverse for good. He added that the virtual village is a dream come true because it calls for an open platform where everyone worldwide can participate.</p>
<p>Shwab revealed that a consortium of over 80 international companies and organizations, including the <a href="https://dailycoin.com/imf-renews-risk-warning-on-stablecoins-but-admits-their-benefits/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="noopener noreferrer">International Monetary Fund (IMF)</a>, World Trade Organization (WTO), and United Nations Development Program (UNDP), among others, partnered to build the Global Collaboration Village.</p>
<p>The WEF executive hoped the metaverse would continuously serve as a meeting ground for Davos’ stakeholders. Schwab added the physical world is limited, while the virtual world is full of unlimited possibilities. He is fascinated by the capabilities of technology despite its experimental nature.</p>
<p>The Global Collaboration Village hopes to increase its impact by encouraging <a href="https://dailycoin.com/macron-shows-up-on-decentraland-first-presidential-speech-in-the-metaverse/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="noopener noreferrer">dialogues between leaders</a> under the WEF.</p>
<p>Later in the press conference, the Vice-Chair President of Microsoft, Brad Smith, emphasized the global importance of the Global Collaboration Village due to the WEF&#8217;s international impact.</p>
<p>He shared that The Global Collaboration Village capitalizes on the opportunity to create a borderless village open to everyone. It enables everyone accessing the internet and the metaverse to engage in a virtual conversation.</p>
<p>Smith also revealed that the Global Collaboration Village would be available on various platforms, including 2D and 3D devices. He added that the virtual village has advanced considerably and is ready for a broader community. Smith concluded that their main goal is to complete the product by this year.</p>

On top of that, Cointree, proud sponsors of Melbourne Storm, added Apecoin (APE), the BAYC-inspired altcoin, with a great monthly bull run despite odds stacked against it. APE holders rejoiced in the news, as it helped the #33 ranked decentralized altcoin climb back to the crucial support level of $5.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At press time, Apecoin <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/apecoin" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">trades at $5.07</a>, according to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">CoinGecko</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly to Apecoin, the mega-popular canine cryptocurrency Shiba Inu (SHIB) enjoyed a fruitful week with 20.9% in the green for the last seven days. On top of that, Shiba Inu’s developer team officially announced <a href="https://dailycoin.com/shiba-inu-shib-shibarium-beta-update-shib-grows-19/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="noopener noreferrer">the launch of Shibarium Beta</a> and laid out the documentation in a lengthy and well-detailed blog post. Subsequently, this sparked a bull run for SHIB and the gas fee token Bone ShibaSwap (BONE).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This comes just a week after SHIB Token officially announced BONE as <a href="https://dailycoin.com/shiba-inu-shib-adds-shibarium-news-section-bone-shibaswap-bone-grows-30-percent/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="noopener noreferrer">the only token used for transactions</a> on the upcoming Layer-2 blockchain. Hence, Shiba Inu erased a zero in its market price, while Bone ShibaSwap restored the key resistance line at $1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At press time, the 15th-ranked Japanese Kabosu guard dog-themed memecurrency <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/shiba-inu" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">is changing hands at $0.00001066</a>, according to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">CoinGecko</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With 3% daily gains, SHIB also is the top gainer among the four aforementioned altcoins, with a 22.9% increase in the last seven days.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">zkEVM, often called the holy grail of Ethereum scaling, stands for zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine, a type of scaling solution for Ethereum that incorporates zero-knowledge proofs to prove the correctness of smart contracts on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Polygon zkEVM’s case, it will operate as a zero-knowledge rollup, meaning that it will take thousands of transactions off-chain, put them in batches, and send the batches to verify on the Ethereum mainnet. This way of verifying transactions increases the throughput and lowers transaction costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Polygon’s zkEVM has been in testnet since last October. The team aims to release the first zkEVM on mainnet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Polygon isn’t the only project planning to release a zkEVM on the Ethereum mainnet this year. Scroll, zkSync, and Consensys are also working on their own zkEVMs and plan to launch them sometime in 2023.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FTX’s influence, both in the crypto space and outside it, was vast. Information about the </span><a href="https://dailycoin.com/sam-bankman-fried-revealed-as-the-biggest-crypto-donor-of-the-u-s-midterm-elections/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">extent of its influence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is still coming out. One of the key figures in FTX’s rise to prominence may have been financier and ex-Trump staffer Anthony Scaramucci. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scaramucci recently announced investing in the former FTX US president’s crypto venture. This investment raised eyebrows, as FTX Ventures made a </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffgapusan/2022/09/13/ftx-investment-in-skybridge-coincides-with-salt-nyc-2022/?sh=54678fed53b5" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$40 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> investment in Scaramucci’s company, SkyBridge. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, his ties to FTX don’t stop there. In 2022, FTX </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ftx-and-salt-agree-to-multi-year-partnership-launch-crypto-bahamas-event-301464946.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">partnered</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Scaramucci’s SALT leadership forum. SALT was the main organizer behind the Crypto Bahamas Forum, an invite-only event featuring speakers like Bill Clinton and Tony Blair. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FTX signed its deals with Scaramucci when the exchange allegedly started its efforts to </span><a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1601140878701400064" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sway regulators and opinion leaders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to its vision of crypto. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company paid billions to politicians and investors to lobby for favorable regulation and gain legitimacy among policymakers. Scaramucci may have been a key figure in that effort. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, Scaramucci started investing in crypto. His firm, SkyBridge Capital, bought $25 million in Bitcoin and reportedly allocated 5% of its portfolio to crypto assets. Scaramucci </span><a href="https://decrypt.co/52381/scaramuccis-hedge-fund-buys-25-million-of-bitcoin-cites-michael-saylor-as-influence" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that an interview with </span><a href="https://dailycoin.com/michael-saylor-and-philosophy-of-bitcoin-maximalism/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin maximalist Michael Saylor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> swayed his decision. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reportedly, the fund’s performance was lackluster at the time. That may have been why in September 2021, Scaramucci signed a </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffgapusan/2022/09/13/ftx-investment-in-skybridge-coincides-with-salt-nyc-2022/?sh=54678fed53b5" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$40 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> deal with FTX Ventures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The venture arm of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX Empire would obtain 30% of SkyBridge, and an option to buy 85% of the company. But his deals with FTX don&#8217;t end here.</span></p>

FTX was pushing for “sensible regulation” for the crypto space. Others have a different take. For instance, Binance&#8217;s CEO Changpeng Zhao said that he used these connections to </span><a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1601140878701400064" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">attack his competitors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In any case, Scaramucci’s influence may have been just what Bankman-Fried was looking for at the time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Forbes, the partnership with Scaramucci opened &#8220;a network of </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffgapusan/2022/09/13/ftx-investment-in-skybridge-coincides-with-salt-nyc-2022/?sh=54678fed53b5" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">global finance relationships</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at a time when TradFi institutions are planning their digital asset strategies.&#8221;</span></p>
<pre><strong>“I’ve been doing this longer than Sam has been alive, so I have <a href="https://www.afr.com/chanticleer/how-the-mooch-helped-push-the-first-domino-in-the-ftx-crash-20221116-p5byub" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">a lot of relationships</a> over there,” Scaramucci said about his relationship with Bankman-Fried. </strong></pre>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scaramucci is not the only high-profile businessman with connections to FTX. Just one month before FTX&#8217;s deal with SkyBridge, Kevin O’Leary became a paid spokesperson for the exchange.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, unlike O’Leary, who still speaks favorably of Bankman-Fried, Scaramucci now thinks it’s “very clear” that there was fraud in FTX. </span></p>
<pre><strong>“I think it’s very clear now that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/13/scaramucci-says-skybridge-can-buy-back-ftx-stake-this-year-alleges-sbf-committed-fraud.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CI%20think%20it&#039;s%20very%20clear,including%20fraud%20and%20money%20laundering." data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">there was fraud</a>. We’ll of course have to let the legal system determine all of those things,” he said.</strong></pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to his work in finance, Scaramucci briefly served as White House Communications Director in 2017 under President Donald Trump. His tenure lasted </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40684697" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">only ten days</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and was mired in conflict with other Trump appointees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He remained loyal to Trump until 2019 when he revealed that he </span><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/08/12/politics/anthony-scaramucci-donald-trump-reelection-cnntv/index.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">no longer supported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> his reelection. He cited Trump’s “racially charged comments” and “divisive tweeting.”</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the freshly-forged master plan, the GTX crypto exchange would offer stocks, at least a hundred cryptocurrencies, and debt claims. Hence, the upcoming GTX exchange adopts a rather cynical approach to “fill the void created by FTX” while <a href="https://dailycoin.com/three-arrows-capital-3ac-founder-blames-dcg-and-ftx-for-terra-luna-collapse/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="noopener noreferrer">trading FTX debt claims</a> on the new platform. GTX plans to unlock about $20 billion of crypto debt claims, which can take up a significant portion of the platform&#8217;s assets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, the bold move from the downtrodden entrepreneurs left many crypto enthusiasts on Twitter wondering if GTX will also offer bids on <a href="https://dailycoin.com/three-arrows-capital-3ac-files-30m-lawsuit-against-own-company-while-on-the-run/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="noopener noreferrer">Three Arrows Capital claims</a>, some of which Su Zhu and Kyle Davies authored themselves.

<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positioning</span> <a href="https://www.sushi.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sushi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a market-leading, community-centric DEX via &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">deep liquidity, optimal pricing, sustainable tokenomics,&#8221; and a user-friendly platform.</span></li>
<li>Releasing a DEX aggregation router to increase swap volumes and fees by leveraging SushiSwap&#8217;s Trident network and <a href="https://forum.sushi.com/t/sushi-tokenomics-redesign/11621" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">new token model proposal</a>.</li>
<li>Maintaining a decentralized organizational structure to promote product autonomy via best principles like “self-custody, equitable governance, &amp; permissionless trading.&#8221;</li>
<li>Implementing newly optimized tokenomics and improving liquidity, sustainability, community ownership, and <a href="https://docs.bitdao.io/partners/sushiswap-dev-team" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">DAO</a> treasury diversification.</li>
<li>Launching Sushi Studios as a decentralized incubator that will allow independently-funded projects to use the Sushi brand and support ecosystem growth without depleting the DAO treasury.</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform will promote deep integration with its network partners as part of these efforts. It will offer them equitable inclusion in the SushiSwap DEX to help make it the go-to exchange for new token launches.</span> <a href="https://twitter.com/jaredgrey/status/1615064993841483786" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also states that the platform has taken measures to secure its “runway for multi-year operations.”</span></p>
