			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The world is constantly changing and evolving in all aspects of existence.</p>
<p>Nowadays, thanks to technological advancements, there are an infinite number of things we can do with our smartphones that can result in a life-changing experience. Cryptocurrency is a real-world and current example. When you hear cryptocurrency, your mind may play tricks on you and send 'risky' investing signals to your brain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This article contains several methods for obtaining free cryptocurrency. Yes&hellip; You heard that right!</p>
<p>Solana and Avalanche offer users the chance to stake their assets and earn free crypto. And on the other side, we have DogeMiyagi ($MIYAGI), a referral-based system that grants users a 10% commission.</p>
<p>Earn Free Solana Coins by Staking and Engaging in the Community</p>
<p></p>
<p>Solana, a leading-edge blockchain platform, has grown in popularity recently. With its excellent throughput and low transaction costs, Solana provides a solid platform for various decentralized applications.</p>
<p>Solana is a one-of-a-kind cryptocurrency that has several advantages over other currencies. One of Solana's most intriguing features is the ability to earn free coins by interacting in its community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are various ways to get free Solana coins, but staking is the most popular. Staking is locking up your funds to help safeguard the Solana network. You get Solana coins in exchange for assisting with the network's security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get started, you must obtain some Solana coins.&nbsp; This may be accomplished by acquiring Solana currency on an exchange or using a Sol-compatible digital wallet. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Stake Assets and Earn Cryptocurrency with Avalanche</p>
<p>Avalanche is a different digital currency gaining traction owing to its innovative technology. Avalanche is a blockchain network with ultra-fast transaction rates and cheap transaction costs. The network can handle up to 4,500 transactions per second, significantly faster than most significant cryptocurrencies' transaction rates.</p>
<p>The consensus mechanism in Avalanche ensures that the network can execute transactions rapidly and effectively while maintaining security. Avalanche may also be traded using Ethereum via the Avalanche'Bridge'. Developers may create decentralized apps that operate on Ethereum and Avalanche.</p>
<p>All sounds great, but let&rsquo;s be honest, who wouldn&rsquo;t want to earn some free crypto AVAX? It is all possible, so why not?</p>
<p>Avalanche, like Solana, allows users to stake assets and earn free cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Using Avalanche's staking procedure, users help network security and consensus procedures by staking AVAX tokens. Stakeholders also earn benefits in the form of more AVAX tokens. Investors can utilize the Avalanche Wallet or one of the ecosystem's staking platforms to bet on Avalanche.</p>
<p>DogeMiyagi's Generous Referral Scheme</p>
<p></p>
<p>While Solana and Avalanche have staking possibilities, DogeMiyagi takes a novel method to earn free cryptocurrency via a referral scheme. DogeMiyagi, a meme coin with a humorous twist, has garnered traction in the cryptocurrency industry. Investors can make passive revenue by encouraging people to join the network using the DogeMiyagi platform.</p>
<p>The referral method provided by DogeMiyagi is simple. Users are given a one-of-a-kind referral link to use with their friends, family, and social media followers. When someone uses their referral link to join up, the user earns a 10% reward on the recommended person's transactions. This strategy allows investors to earn free cryptocurrency by promoting DogeMiyagi and utilizing their network.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>Opportunities to obtain free crypto are constantly developing in the volatile world of cryptocurrency. Seasoned investors and finance lovers might discover new ways to diversify their portfolios by examining platforms like Solana and Avalanche. Solana's staking system allows users to earn more SOL tokens by helping secure the network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Avalanche offers a similar possibility, allowing investors to stake and get returns for their AVAX tokens. DogeMiyagi, on the other hand, provides a referral-based system that will enable customers to earn a 10% fee on suggested purchases. Each service offers a distinct strategy for obtaining free cryptocurrency, catering to various investment plans and interests.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Price spikes and listings of popular cryptocurrencies have kickstarted the meme coin season. While the meme coin market has found its contenders in the likes of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, new meme coins are quickly emerging to take over. Love Hate Inu brings utility with its Vote-To-Earn scheme, its rewards and prizes galore with Big Eyes Coin (BIG). It makes one wonder, can Big Eyes Coin and Love Hate Inu take the fight to meme coin giants? Read on to find out!</p>
<p>Love Hate Inu: Voting is Winning</p>
<p>The upcoming Love Hate Inu (LHINU) has paved a unique way for users to earn rewards-by voting. The meme coin began its 8-stage presale on March 9, 2023, and is on a mission to reach a hard cap of $10 million in less than three months.</p>
<p>By offering a blockchain-powered voting platform, Love Hate Inu aims to disrupt the online survey market. The platform will use distributed ledger technology to record immutable results, which will be combined with Stake-To-Earn and Vote-To-Earn mechanisms to incentivize participation.</p>
<p>Love Hate Inu has launched its mainnet with a total of 100 billion LHINU tokens. Of these, 90% have been allocated to the presale, while the remaining 10% will be used for liquidity, exchange listings, and community rewards. By selling 90% of the tokens, Love Hate Inu aims to avoid rug pulls and build a strong community foundation. The token has 0% transaction tax, which makes it an attractive investment option for traders.</p>
<p>However, it is important to remember that meme coins such as Love Hate Inu are highly speculative investments. They are often subject to sudden price fluctuations and are not backed by any tangible assets. Additionally, they can be subject to manipulation by large holders or "whales."</p>
<p>Big Eyes Aiming for the Moon</p>
<p></p>
<p>Have you heard? There is a new cat in Meme Coin Town! Big Eyes Coin (BIG) is approaching launch by the minute and is all ready to make some &ldquo;Aww Fortune&rdquo;! They have created quite a stir, having collected an impressive $36.78 Million in what has been a presale run by no other coin after Ethereum!&nbsp;</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t surprising that they managed to do this. Have a look at their features: transactions that are exempt of buying, selling and trading fees, a liquidity lock of two years on the initial supply released on launch, the initiative of a charity wallet that funds ocean sanctuaries - you&rsquo;d think it can&rsquo;t get any better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it just did. They feature Lootboxes, which are packages you can buy to win rewards that are ALWAYS worth equal or more than what you paid for the box. Even their roadmap is laced with exciting plans, including a casino that will be home to 4000+ games, including those that you can play to earn! You can&rsquo;t go wrong with this meme coin. And now, on popular demand, BIG has preponed the end of their presale to June 3rd. But not until they pull one last trick.</p>
<p>The team recently announced that they are selling BIG tokens at their stage 3 price until the end of the presale!&nbsp; The stage 3 price of big eyes is $0.00017 for one BIG Token. Big Eyes is all about winning, and winning BIG!</p>
<p>The Takeaway: Can Big Eyes Coin and Love Hate Inu Take the Fight to Meme Coin Giants?</p>
<p>While meme coins are quickly taking the spotlight in the crypto market, it needs to be reiterated that these do not have real utility and are highly susceptible to fads and market frenzy. Meme coins are required to focus on utility while actively expanding the community to make the cut in the market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Love Hate Inu, there is nothing beyond their Vote-To-Earn feature that will sustain their gradual rise post-launch. This is not the case with Big Eyes, which has a roadmap that refuses to flatline and caters to a wider investor base. So if you&rsquo;re wondering &ldquo;Can Big Eyes Coin and Love Hate Inu take the fight to meme coin giants?&rdquo; Big Eyes Coin is definitely a contender that must not be overlooked.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In a significant development for the blockchain industry, IoTeX's community has overwhelmingly voted in favor of Improvement Protocol 21 (IIP-21), paving the way for bridging IOTX, the native coin of the IoTeX network, to Ethereum.</p>
<p>The proposal received overwhelming support from the IoTeX community, with a final tally of 306 million IOTX (73.77%) voting in favor of the bridge, while 109 million IOTX (26.23%) opposed the proposal.</p>
<p>A total of 334 wallets participated in the vote, whose successful outcome reflects the community's enthusiasm for expanding the utility and reach of IOTX through cross-chain interoperability.</p>
<p>Enormous potential for Ethereum and IoTeX</p>
<p>Blockchain bridges have gained increasing attention as they offer numerous benefits to the blockchain ecosystem. By enabling tokens to move seamlessly between different blockchains, bridges address scalability challenges, reduce network congestion, and enhance user experiences.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of the primary motivations behind IIP-21 is to leverage Ethereum's robust DeFi ecosystem, increase IoTeX token liquidity within Ethereum, and build a vibrant developer and user community,&rdquo; said IoTeX CEO and Co-Founder Raullen Chai. &ldquo;The proposed bridge between IoTeX and Ethereum holds immense potential for both platforms and the broader blockchain community,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>Presently, IOTX exists on the IoTeX network and is bridged to Binance Smart Chain and Polygon.</p>
<p>Addressing limitations</p>
<p>However, the legacy ERC-20 version of IOTX on Ethereum, known as IOTX-E, has limited supply and circulation, restricting its usage in DeFi protocols and availability on major centralized exchanges.</p>
<p>The proposal aims to address these limitations by implementing CIOTX (Cross Chain IOTX), a wrapped version of IOTX on the Ethereum blockchain. CIOTX will be fully backed by the circulating IOTX on IoTeX, ensuring a sufficient supply for utilization in any Ethereum-based DeFi application and circulation on centralized exchanges.</p>
<p>This strategic move enables IoTeX to tap into the thriving DeFi ecosystem on Ethereum, including on popular protocols like Uniswap, Curve, Aave, and Compound.</p>
<p>Seamless token swapping</p>
<p>Introducing CIOTX on Ethereum will facilitate the seamless swapping of tokens between CIOTX and IOTX-E. By listing CIOTX alongside IOTX-E on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and Curve, users can exchange the two tokens at market prices, with the market determining their respective values based on demand. This feature enhances liquidity and provides greater flexibility for users in managing their IOTX assets.</p>
<p>The benefits of blockchain bridges extend beyond IoTeX and Ethereum. With IoTeX diverting some network traffic away from Ethereum, the bridge helps alleviate congestion and scalability challenges the Ethereum network faces. By dispersing transactions to other less congested blockchains, bridges contribute to the overall improvement of blockchain scalability and user experience.</p>
<p>A fantastic step forward</p>
<p>The successful passage of IIP-21 signifies a significant step forward for IoTeX and the broader blockchain community. With the bridging of IOTX to Ethereum and the introduction of CIOTX, IoTeX aims to create a comprehensive ecosystem of IOTX-backed tokens that can be utilized across multiple blockchains.</p>
<p>This integration of IoTeX and Ethereum opens new possibilities for DeFi applications, enhancing the utility and value of IOTX while promoting interoperability within the blockchain landscape.</p>
<p>As the blockchain industry continues to evolve, bridges like the one proposed in IIP-21 play a crucial role in unlocking the full potential of different blockchain platforms. By enabling seamless token transfers, bridges enhance scalability, reduce congestion, and foster collaboration between blockchain ecosystems, ultimately driving innovation and adoption in the decentralized finance space.</p>
<p>Leveraging IoTeX&rsquo;s speed and efficiency</p>
<p>With the bridging of IOTX to Ethereum, businesses can now explore the possibility of enabling instant payments using IOTX or CIOTX tokens, leveraging the speed and efficiency of the IoTeX network while benefiting from Ethereum's vast user base and DeFi infrastructure.</p>
<p>The successful implementation of IIP-21 and bridging IOTX to Ethereum represent a significant milestone in the blockchain industry. As blockchain bridges continue to gain prominence, we expect to witness the emergence of new use cases and innovative applications across various sectors, ultimately driving the widespread adoption of blockchain technology and fostering a more interconnected and efficient decentralized ecosystem.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s7">As the cryptocurrency market navigates through its unpredictable nature, Huobi Token (HT) experiences a stumble and Dogecoin (DOGE) lackluster performance disappoints investors looking for more promising opportunities. </p>
<p class="s7">Amidst this ever-changing landscape, Yachtify (YCHT) emerges as a captivating prospect, garnering the attention of investors seeking a more innovative and lucrative alternative. By revolutionizing the luxury yacht investment sector and leveraging the power of blockchain and NFTs, Yachtify (YCHT) presents a unique and cutting-edge approach to diversifying investment portfolios and capitalizing on the thriving digital asset market.</p>
<p class="s9">Investors Turn Their Sights to Yachtify (YCHT): The Future of Fractional Yacht Investments</p>
<p class="s7">As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, savvy investors are constantly on the lookout for innovative projects with groundbreaking potential. Yachtify (YCHT) is one such project that has captured the attention of forward-thinking investors, offering a unique and compelling investment opportunity in the world of luxury yachts.</p>
<p class="s7">Yachtify (YCHT) is a revolutionary platform that leverages blockchain technology to bring fractional yacht ownership to the masses. By enabling investors to buy, sell and rent fractions of high-end yachts, Yachtify (YCHT) is democratizing access to an asset class once reserved for the ultra-wealthy.</p>
<p class="s7">One of the most enticing aspects of Yachtify (YCHT) is its upcoming presale, during which tokens will be available at a highly attractive price of just $0.12 per token. Moreover, investors participating in the presale stage can take advantage of a generous 30% bonus on their purchases. This enticing offer provides a rare opportunity to enter a potentially lucrative market at an early stage, maximizing potential returns. In a market filled with countless investment opportunities, Yachtify (YCHT) stands out as a beacon of innovation, offering a unique approach to luxury asset investments. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY YACHTIFY TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s9">Dogecoin (DOGE) Whale Moves 2 Billion DOGE </p>
<p class="s7">A major Dogecoin (DOGE) whale made significant moves on May 9th, unloading 300 million DOGE tokens, equivalent to $21.73 million, onto Binance. A deeper dive into on-chain data reveals that this whale conducted a staggering transaction of 1.98 billion DOGE, valued at $160 million. The transaction saw the transfer of the remaining 1.68 billion DOGE to a new wallet, making it the 8th largest wallet holding 1.21% of the total DOGE in circulation. Concurrently, other whales have shifted their DOGE and Shiba Inu (SHIB) holdings, some opting for PEPE or temporarily stepping back from the market.</p>
<p class="s7">Over the past 24 hours, a total of 2.20 billion DOGE tokens have been shifted. In the same period, DOGE's price has dropped by over 2%, currently valued at $0.073, amidst heightened trading volume due to the whale-induced selloff. Binance's expanded support for tokens like PEPE and FLOKI raises questions about potential impact on DOGE's price. As DOGE trades below critical levels, the likelihood of it hitting the $0.065 support level is high. This downward trend, anticipated by whales, is evident in both Shiba Inu and Dogecoin.</p>
<p class="s9">Huobi Token (HT) Struggles as Decentralized Exchanges Gain Traction</p>
<p class="s7">Exchange cryptocurrencies like Huobi Token (HT) were once considered among the safest investments in the crypto space. However, with the recent failure of FTX, major cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance face regulatory scrutiny, the growing popularity of decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and the enthusiasm for Huobi Token (HT) and other exchange-based tokens have waned.</p>
<p class="s7">Huobi Token (HT) roots lie in China, a country currently experiencing technological decoupling from the US. This increases the likelihood of regulatory crackdowns, potentially hindering Huobi Token (HT) from fully recovering from these setbacks. While Huobi Token (HT) prospects and other exchange-based tokens seem bleak, many opportunities abound in the crypto market. For example, Yachtify (YCHT) is aiming to revive the NFT market and momentum is already building in its favor.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Yet another day in the crypto game and things are heating up. Investors are on the grind, ready to pounce on any price movements and dig up some serious gems in the market. Several investors are discovering the potential of Sparklo, a platform that aims to provide a new alternative-investment platform on the blockchain network. </p>
<p>Sparklo is believed to be the next big thing that investors have been searching for since the crazy price surges of those OG cryptos. However, shockingly, more than 80% of Cardano (ADA) holders are unsafe, while Shiba Inu (SHIB) community anticipates a cold wallet. </p>
<p class="s4">Sparklo (SPRK), the investor's favourite in the midst of others</p>
<p>Sparklo is a revolutionary alternative investment platform on the blockchain network that's still in its presale phase. With Sparklo, you might be investing in a blue-chip crypto investment with enormous growth potential and the possibility of a high return on investment. Investing in Sparklo early turns out to be a wise decision for many investors.</p>
<p>Currently priced at just $0.022, investors can take seize this opportunity to invest in a very promising project like Sparklo. The Sparklo platform has been audited by the InterFi Network, its liquidity will be locked for 100 yeras and the team completed their KYC verification. All of these aspects increase the level of trust, security and appeal of the Sparklo platform.</p>
<p>Savvy investors recognize that investing early in projects like Sparklo is often where significant profits are made. However, this opportunity is limited and investors need to act fast to capitalize on this offer. Sparklo is undoubtedly a very promising investment opportunity that investors should consider exploring further. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY SPRK TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s4">Surprisingly 80% of addresses are unsafe for Cardano (ADA) holders</p>
<p>More than 80% of Cardano (ADA) holders, or over 3.53 million addresses, are losing money right now, according to IntoTheBlock. However, of those Cardano (ADA) addresses, only 682,920 (or around 16%) are profitable. At the current Cardano (ADA) price of $0.33 per token, an additional 173,770 holder addresses, or 4% of the total, are profitable.</p>
<p>This is intriguing because it coincides with the beginning of April when the local peak of Cardano (ADA) token trading occurred. That is to say, investors bought a lot of Cardano (ADA) because of the price action, only to be locked in with Cardano (ADA) losses the very following week. Those losses have continued to compound over the past four weeks for Cardano (ADA).</p>
<p class="s4">Expect a huge announcement about the new Shiba Inu (SHIB) cold wallet</p>
<p>The Shiba Inu (SHIB) community may anticipate that the chilly "cold" wallet, with its innovative tech and eye-catching appearance, will meet their needs. This week, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) community may expect to hear some big news about the impending cold wallet. Recent disclosure has sparked rumors that the wallet may be revealed as soon as this weekend and it is anticipated that it will serve the entire Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem.</p>
<p>An anonymous developer leaked the information today on the Shiba Inu (SHIB) Discord server. If all goes as planned, the Shibarium1 promises an announcement or update on the Shiba Inu(SHIB) cold wallet within the next few days. A well-known figure in the Shiba Inu (SHIB) community tweeted recently to draw attention to the latest revelation but did not specify when exactly.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s8">Upward and downward trends are terms commonly associated with asset trading, including cryptocurrencies. As the name suggests, upward trends mark the movement of an asset in a positive direction, while downwards means the opposite.</p>
<p class="s8">Lately, crypto sensation, Uwerx has been moving in an upward trend. What is Uwerx, and why is everyone talking about it?</p>
<p class="s8">This article will discuss Uwerx and its potential to see if it can perform just as or even better than popular tokens like The Graph (GRT) and ImmutableX (IMX).</p>
<p class="s8">Uwerx (WERX) The Profit Magnet</p>
<p class="s8">Uwerx has been the buzz in the past few weeks. As it enters its fourth presale stage, the team is prepping the project ahead of the launch date with some changes. Instead of the initially proposed 5%, Uwerx will reduce transaction fees to just 1%. The WERX token price increased to $0.0225 on 10th of May (18:00 UTC). The launch price will shift slightly from its initial price of $0.09-$0.11 to $0.095-$0.115</p>
<p class="s8">The developers are excited and believe these changes will make users confident. As the project presale ends, the team will initiate a 25-year liquidity lock on developers&rsquo; tokens to prevent rug pull. They will also renounce smart contract ownership when the project lists on centralized exchanges.</p>
<p class="s8">This move is novel and is among the reasons Uwerx is attracting so much attention. An additional 1% has also been released by the team to buyers, bringing their token allocation to just 7%.</p>
<p class="s8">Uwerx believes it should accommodate the fast-expanding freelance market, as reports show that almost 80% of large cooperations plan to increase their dependency on freelancers by 2031. </p>
<p class="s8">Uwerx will support a plethora of features on its network in anticipation of its large user base. Some of these features will include a certified escrow payment system, incentive packages to encourage productivity, and a strict no-third-party policy on clients.</p>
<p class="s8">Uwerx will likely list on well-known exchanges soon thanks to help from SolidProof and InterFiNetwork, the audit approving bodies. The hard-cap presale will end on the last day of July 2023. The team has set next week as the launch date for its Alpha version of the project. According to the team, this Alpha version will increase productivity and promote transparency.</p>
<p class="s8">Approximately 427,500,000 million WERX tokens have been released for presale, and the project has completed its first, second, and third presale stages without a hitch. We recommend purchasing now as prices could reach $1.45 by Q3-Q4 2023 and $2.30 by Q1-Q2 2024.</p>
<p class="s8">Can You Keep Up with The Graph (GRT)?</p>
<p class="s8">In the past week, The Graph (GRT) has decreased by almost 8.15%, putting its current price at $0.13 and market cap at $1.1 billion. A price depreciation of 1.40% in the past two days might suggest a future decline in price. However, analysts remain confident it will reach $0.24 by Q1 2024.</p>
<p class="s8">The Graph (GRT) is an Ethereum-based global data bank that indexes and accesses blockchain data from storage networks. The platform can quickly, securely, and reliably organize data stored on its network through its data sorting protocol called Subgraph. Eventually, data stored on The Graph (GRT) can be categorized, transformed, and shared across various dApps.</p>
<p class="s8">The Graph (GRT) blockchain is run by an open network of users. With the aid of these users comprised of indexers, curators, and delegators, the platform can supply and organize data and even provide security to the network.</p>
<p class="s8">Join the ImmutableX (IMX) Train</p>
<p class="s8">After taking a significant blow of almost 14.18%, ImmutableX (IMX) is currently at $0.86 and has a market cap of $828,256,522. This Ethereum-based Layer-2 blockchain has shown tremendous growth in the past several months, and according to analysts, it could experience a bullish run and hit $1.30 by Q1 2024.</p>
<p class="s8">Through ImmutableX (IMX), users can mint, sell, and trade NFT assets with little training or knowledge. It offers instant trade confirmations, high-security layers, and low gas fees. NFTs built on the ImmutableX (IMX) platform can be sold or bought on any NFT marketplace.</p>
<p class="s8">Gamers and developers can instantly customize their favorite characters as digital assets and access trades, games, and applications. The platform is powered by a next-gen interface called Starkey. Starkey will provide additional levels of security and scalability to the network.</p>
<p class="s8">Indicators show that The Graph (GRT) and ImmuatbleX (IMX) might be profitable in the short term, but Uwerx has better long-term profit potential. </p>

<p class="s8">In the past week, The Graph (GRT) has decreased by almost 8.15%, putting its current price at $0.13 and market cap at $1.1 billion. A price depreciation of 1.40% in the past two days might suggest a future decline in price. However, analysts remain confident it will reach $0.24 by Q1 2024.</p>
<p class="s8">The Graph (GRT) is an Ethereum-based global data bank that indexes and accesses blockchain data from storage networks. The platform can quickly, securely, and reliably organize data stored on its network through its data sorting protocol called Subgraph. Eventually, data stored on The Graph (GRT) can be categorized, transformed, and shared across various dApps.</p>
<p class="s8">The Graph (GRT) blockchain is run by an open network of users. With the aid of these users comprised of indexers, curators, and delegators, the platform can supply and organize data and even provide security to the network.</p>
<p class="s8">Join the ImmutableX (IMX) Train</p>
<p class="s8">After taking a significant blow of almost 14.18%, ImmutableX (IMX) is currently at $0.86 and has a market cap of $828,256,522. This Ethereum-based Layer-2 blockchain has shown tremendous growth in the past several months, and according to analysts, it could experience a bullish run and hit $1.30 by Q1 2024.</p>
<p class="s8">Through ImmutableX (IMX), users can mint, sell, and trade NFT assets with little training or knowledge. It offers instant trade confirmations, high-security layers, and low gas fees. NFTs built on the ImmutableX (IMX) platform can be sold or bought on any NFT marketplace.</p>
<p class="s8">Gamers and developers can instantly customize their favorite characters as digital assets and access trades, games, and applications. The platform is powered by a next-gen interface called Starkey. Starkey will provide additional levels of security and scalability to the network.</p>
<p class="s8">Indicators show that The Graph (GRT) and ImmuatbleX (IMX) might be profitable in the short term, but Uwerx has better long-term profit potential. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In cryptocurrency trading, traders face the decision of choosing between decentralized and centralized exchanges. While decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are gaining popularity for their decentralized nature and self-custody of funds, centralized exchanges (CEXs) remain the dominant choice for many. However, these platforms must employ the correct measures to establish and retain trust.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
A Cautionary Tale
<p>The recent crash of the FTX exchange is a stark reminder of the importance of transparency and security in centralized cryptocurrency exchanges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A lack of auditing, open communication, and publication of key metrics can lead to disastrous consequences for traders who entrust their assets to these platforms. To avoid such mishaps, traders must diligently select centralized exchanges prioritizing transparency and security.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
BitMEX: A Commitment to Transparency and Security
<p>BitMEX, a leading centralized cryptocurrency exchange, is an exemplary model for transparency and security in the industry. Since 2021, long before the FTX crash, BitMEX has demonstrated its commitment to these values through its on-chain Proof of Reserves and Proof of Liabilities data.</p>
<p>The Proof of Reserves and Proof of Liabilities data allows users to verify that BitMEX holds funds over aggregate client balances. By publishing this information twice weekly, BitMEX ensures users have up-to-date and accurate data to monitor the platform's solvency. This level of transparency instills confidence in the platform and sets the standard for other centralized exchanges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
StormGain: Offering a Unique Hybrid Approach
<p>StormGain is another platform that showcases a commitment to transparency and security in the cryptocurrency space. As a unique hybrid of a decentralized and centralized exchange, StormGain offers crypto derivatives trading through its decentralized exchange (DEX) while leveraging the liquidity of its centralized exchange (CEX).</p>
<p>Users can connect their wallets (e.g., MetaMask) to the StormGain DEX and choose the cryptocurrency they wish to use for derivative trading. Upon confirming the blockchain transaction for the trade amount, the crypto is sent via blockchain to the StormGain DEX smart contract, and the trade is opened. When the user closes the trade, the crypto returns to the user's wallet from the StormGain DEX smart contract.</p>
<p>All trades use StormGain CEX liquidity. This approach allows StormGain to offer exceptional trading conditions for DEX traders while maintaining the security and transparency of a centralized exchange.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Key Takeaways for Traders
<p>In light of the FTX crash and the importance of transparency and security in centralized exchanges, traders should consider the following when selecting a platform:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Auditing: Ensure the centralized exchange undergoes regular third-party audits to verify its solvency and security measures.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Open Communication: Platforms should maintain open communication channels with users, providing updates on system maintenance, security incidents, and any other relevant information.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Publication of Key Metrics: Exchanges should publish key metrics such as Proof of Reserves and Proof of Liabilities data to allow users to verify the platform's solvency.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Security Measures: Assess the exchange's security measures, including multi-factor authentication, secure storage of user funds, and regular penetration testing.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">History and Reputation: Investigate the exchange's history and reputation within the industry to gauge its commitment to transparency and security.</li>
</ol>
Conclusion
<p>Centralized cryptocurrency exchanges may not offer the same level of decentralization as their decentralized counterparts. Moreover, there has been a string of incidents involving centralized trading platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any mishap involving one company casts a dark shadow on all other players. Maintaining a healthy trust balance requires all industry participants to form a unified front regarding transparency and accountability.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Blockchain-based settlement platform, Zeebu announces its collaboration with four global telecom carriers, BBT Voice Limited, Broadband Telecom Inc ., BridgeVoice Inc. and Novatel, d.o.o. to extend its solutions to millions of customers and enhance transactions globally in the telecom carrier industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zeebu, a blockchain settlements solution for global telecom carriers announced a strategic partnership with BBT Voice Limited, Broadband Telecom Inc., BridgeVoice Inc., and Slovenia&rsquo;s Novatel this Monday. In the announcement, Zeebu will provide its end-to-end blockchain transactions settlement solution for the telecom partners with an aim to boost the speed, efficiency and trust for &ldquo;hundreds of thousands of transactions annually&rdquo; in the global telecom carrier industry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The world of telecommunications is fast-paced and ever-changing. The power of blockchain technology lies not just in its ability to facilitate transactions but in its capacity to foster trust and transparency,&rdquo; said Raj Brahmbhatt, Founder &amp; CEO, Zeebu. &ldquo;We are sure Zeebu&rsquo;s partnerships with key telecom leaders will usher in a new era of innovation and growth.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The partnerships will further foster the development of B2B channels to ease transactions in the telecom carrier industry, creating lasting value and driving sustainable growth for all its partners. Since its launch, Zeebu has provided the global telecom carrier market with a unique loyalty and utility token that enhances cross-border transactions by reducing transactional costs and increasing trust using blockchain technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, Zeebu also provides solutions that tackle the challenges in the global telecom carrier industry including security threats, rising and complex costs between intermediaries, and remittance delays. Via its utility token, Zeebu allows global carriers to easily transact with one another, unlocking instant global transactions and leveraging enterprise-grade security to protect against cyber attacks and fraud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Telecommunications is an incredibly dynamic and rapidly evolving field, and keeping up with the latest technologies, trends, and customer demands can be challenging,&rdquo; said Nakul Rege, Chief Growth Officer of Broadband Telecom Services, a globally recognized telecom carrier enabling billions of call minutes on its dedicated and globally accessible network. &ldquo;Zeebu's blockchain platform will drive innovation, expand our reach, and deliver exceptional customer value.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the partners, BBT Voice&rsquo;s CEO, Rahul Sharma, believes the partnership marks &ldquo;a cornerstone moment&rdquo;, with the partnership with Zeebu set to further improve its global voice and SMS carrier services. BBT Voice boasts offices around the world including UK, India, Armenia, and Ukraine and has over 400 smaller interconnections across the globe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are confident that with our combined strength, we will construct remarkable achievements in the blockchain industry,&rdquo; Sharma added. &ldquo;We are sure the platform will deliver on its promises of transparency and trust.&rdquo;</p>

<p>BridgeVoice Inc, deals with retail and wholesale VoIP termination services, providing its users with a range of products including its novel Automated Carrier Platform for telecom operators, carriers and service providers and the &ldquo;BridgeVoice Pluto&rdquo;, an online trading and settlement of wholesale interconnect voice and SMS services platform. The partnership with Zeebu will accelerate the connection between wholesale businesses in the global telecom carrier industry, providing instant settlements anywhere in the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Bridge Voice, Chief Revenue Officer, Nickey Peshwani said during the announcement,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zeebu is the first blockchain-powered telecom loyalty platform for wholesale voice business and will enable instant settlements anywhere in the world. With its secure, rewards-based payments ecosystem, we&rsquo;re confident it&rsquo;s going to boost margins for every industry player.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Apart from speed and reducing costs, Zeebu leverages smart contracts and blockchain technology to enhance trustlessness and transparency for settlements across telecom carriers. Additionally, Zeebu utility tokens eliminate the need for conventional banking channels and intermediaries, making cross-border transactions fast and seamless.</p>
<p>Hence, Novatel, one of the leading mobile virtual network operators in Slovenia, will benefit greatly from the latest collaboration. The firm provides mobile and IP telephone internet to European enterprises and plans to build out and launch its own mobile network this summer. Speaking on the partnership with Zeebu, Novatel CEO Jernej Kenda said,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t wait to get started with Zeebu. It will be a game-changer for settlements in the telecom carrier industry, with its powerful utility delivering tangible value for all network participants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Following the collaborations with some of the most significant players in the global telecom carrier industry, Zeebu aims to usher in a new era, introducing the power of blockchain technology to the industry. This will enhance the B2B settlements, offering more efficient, cost-effective operations and faster settlements. In future, Zeebu is planning to introduce its solutions to other B2B industries facing similar challenges, the team statement concludes.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The G7 committee recently convened in Niigata, Japan to explore how Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) can help establish a global financial system. Is this ultimate control?</p>
<p>The gathering brought together top economies: UK, US, Canada, France, Germany Italy and Japan- ahead of the annual G7 summit scheduled for May 19th-21st.&nbsp;</p>
Stability, resilience, and integrity?
<p>In an official communique following the event, participants pledged to have extensive discussions on digital currency policies with the objective of leveraging innovative advancements like better payment efficiency, while navigating potential risks which might harm the global monetary systems' stability, resilience and integrity.</p>
<p>At the top of the committee&rsquo;s list was to ensure reliability, stability, and transparency for global payments - the foundation for effective economic and fiscal activity. It is the belief of the G7 committee that CBDCs offer hope in making this happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) there are some notable differences between them and decentralised cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin &ndash; primarily that they are centralised and represent a digitised iteration of a nation's fiat currency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While these differences matter, the G7 committee takes the view that what is important is ensuring that any CBDC implementation upholds fundamental principles such as transparency, compliance with legal requirements, sound economic governance practices, cybersecurity measures, and data protection regulations.&nbsp;</p>
Opinion
<p>As the banking system continues to come under severe duress due to focussing on profit rather than the protection of bank clients&rsquo; funds, it is obvious that the fiat monetary system is teetering on the edge.</p>
<p>Central banks have put themselves in hock to prop the system up for the time being, having made this decision on behalf of citizens who will foot the bill by seeing the purchasing power of their fiat currencies depreciate even further.</p>
<p>The G7 committee understands very well that the only way that it can prolong the life of the fiat monetary system is by tying everyone into the system by imposing a central bank digital currency upon them. This will give central banks complete power over how a citizen spends or saves their currency.</p>
<p>If for example, a citizen sought to spend some of their digital dollars, yen, pounds etc. on something like Bitcoin, code behind the CBDC could be inserted to prevent them from doing so. This would lead to ultimate control, and what some might term as &ldquo;financial slavery&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No amount of promises or laws or whatever should be accepted that state that privacy and financial freedom will be upheld. Governments have already proven (Canadian freedom truckers) that they have the power to freeze bank accounts and blacklist Bitcoin wallets etc. With a CBDC, their ability to control your finances and surveil you can be unbounded.</p>
<p>History shows us that as world empires start to decline, those in control impose ever more draconian censorship and control measures. The hope is that just as has happened throughout history, the small band of independent thinkers determined to achieve freedom will be able to do so once again.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>A newly published report from Elliptic, commissioned by Nikkei, found Asia accounts for 60% of losses to North Korean hackers, with Japan suffering the worst. </p>
<p>A report published by Elliptic and commissioned by Nikkei Asia found that Asian countries make up three of the four top targets of hacking. The report further found that Japan suffered 30% of the losses from North Korean crypto hacking.</p>
<p>Elliptic&rsquo;s study analyzed cryptocurrency losses to cyberattacks from North Korea from 2017 to 2022 and looked at both hacking and ransomware attacks which it describes as North Korea&rsquo;s &ldquo;national strategy.&rdquo;</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Elliptic: North Korean hackers stole $2.3B in crypto from businesses from 2017 to 2022, including $721M from Japan, $497M from the US, and $281M from Hong Kong (Nikkei Asia)https://t.co/abeNfsBd5khttps://t.co/undE8tEmJq</p>

</p>
<p>According to the report, Japan realized losses of $721 million in cyber-attacks representing 30% of the global total of $2.3 billion based on an estimate of $640 million of cryptocurrencies lost in 2022. Nikkei reports the United Nations found that crypto theft reached new highs in 2022:</p>

<p>According to the Japan External Trade Organization, the $721 million stolen from Japan is 8.8 times greater than the value of North Korea&rsquo;s exports in 2021.</p>

Lax Security Played a Role
<p>Elliptic reported that Vietnam was the second-most attacked country losing $540 million, the US third with $497 million in losses, and Hong Kong fourth with losses of $281 million.</p>
<p>The report identified lax security in Japan and Vietnam&rsquo;s crypto markets as the motivation for hackers to target these countries.</p>
North Korean Missile Program Funded by Stolen Crypto
<p>The White House revealed last week that almost half of North Korea&rsquo;s missile program is funded by stolen crypto and cyber-attacks.</p>
<p>US officials have long suspected that stolen assets have funded Pyongyang&rsquo;s weapons development program, and reports from the United Nations and private firms indicate that hacking is a crucial source of revenue for the country.</p>
<p>The Kim Jong Un-led dictatorship has reportedly stolen over $1 billion from the cryptocurrency sectors through the activities of the Lazarus Group.</p>
<p>The infamous Lazarus Group has been linked to high-profile attacks such as the $100 million hack of Harmony Protocol&rsquo;s Horizon Bridge. &nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BlockFi has announced that it plans to liquidate its crypto lending platform to pay back creditors, the company stated in a New Jersey bankruptcy court document filed on Friday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Creditors have been given until the 28th of July, 2023, to vote on the company&rsquo;s restructuring plan if the court approves it.</p>
Liquidation The Only Viable Option&nbsp;
<p>The bankrupt company stated that it had come to the conclusion that selling the business would not generate adequate value for its creditors. BlockFi had been given an extension to formulate its bankruptcy plan in April adequately. Debtors associated with the bankrupt lender also filed their amended reorganization plan and disclosure statement on Friday. BlockFi&rsquo;s Chapter 11 reorganization plan will be sent to its creditors, including over 100,000 retail customers, for a vote.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The court will determine which creditors that have repayment claims are eligible to vote on BlockFi&rsquo;s restructuring plan. Creditors that the court has given voting rights will have time until the 28th of July, 2023, to vote in favor or against the plan. Alternatively, they can also opt to sit out the voting process. BlockFi stated that it had engaged with potential buyers in an effort to conclude a sale of its digital assets platform and around 660,000 client accounts. However, it came to the conclusion that a sale would not generate adequate value for its creditors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BlockFi blamed recent regulatory developments and problems as a prominent reason why it was unable to receive adequate offers from potential buyers.&nbsp;</p>
Recovery Depends On Outcome Of Pending Litigation&nbsp;
<p>BlockFi&rsquo;s lawyers, in a letter to creditors, stated that asset recovery for their clients depends on the outcomes of lawsuits against other firms that it claims had defrauded them. These firms include crypto trading firm Alameda Research and cryptocurrency exchange FTX. Both entities were founded by Sam Bankman-Fried. Apart from these two companies, the list consists of crypto miner core scientific and crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC). According to BlockFi lawyers, the success or failure of the lawsuits against these firms could make a difference totaling in excess of $1 billion for clients. BlockFi noted,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The results of that litigation may achieve prospective high-end recoveries exceeding 90% for certain classes of claims. Client recoveries will be increased or decreased massively (with total swings in client recoveries potentially exceeding $1 billion) depending on whether BlockFi can succeed in these litigations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The developments come after a significant win for BlockFi customers that had crypto held in custodial, non-interest-bearing accounts. According to reports, US Bankruptcy Judge Michael Kaplan gave permission to BlockFi to return around $297 million to customers that operated these types of accounts. Judge Kaplan ruled that the customers in question were the owners of their deposits held in BlockFi&rsquo;s wallet program. BlockFi&rsquo;s wallet program did not pay out any interest to customers and kept funds separate from other funds held by the company. BlockFi had frozen transfers in November 2022, shortly before declaring bankruptcy, as it got caught in the maelstrom triggered by the FTX collapse.&nbsp;</p>
Crypto Firms Continue To Struggle&nbsp;
<p>Several cryptocurrency firms had to file for bankruptcy over the past year. These include Alameda Research, FTX, Celsius Network, Core Scientific, Three Arrows Capital, and Voyager Digital. Some of the firms in question have had to go the way of liquidation as they struggle to come up with funds and strike deals to help them out of bankruptcy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US arm of cryptocurrency exchange Binance had, last month, terminated an agreement with Voyager Digital to purchase user accounts. Binance cited several regulatory concerns as the reason behind the termination of the agreement. Voyager then stated it would go ahead with liquidation pending any objections before the 15th of May deadline.</p>

<p>The FLUUS token is currently available to buy on the FantomStarter platform for a hugely discounted price, where its pre-sale runs from now until May 23.&nbsp;</p>

<p>

</p>
<p>FLUUS has set itself the noteworthy goal of making Web3 more accessible to millions, and to do that it&rsquo;s targeting one of the primary challenges faced by many new users to crypto. There are millions of people who still find it difficult to access the world of crypto, simply because they don&rsquo;t know where to start. Especially in developing markets, many people still don&rsquo;t understand how to buy and sell crypto, partly because they have no access to traditional banking services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FLUUS&rsquo;s founders understand this problem well, because they all come from developing nations in the Middle East and North Africa. Their upbringing means that not only are they familiar with the challenges people face in getting to grips with crypto, but they&rsquo;re also fully aware of how crypto can potentially transform those societies by providing access to savings, financial services and investment opportunities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To solve the onboarding problem for millions of people, FLUUS&rsquo;s team has created a unique crypto payments gateway that, for the first time, enables people to buy crypto directly with cash through its partners, as well as a variety of common payment apps. The company&rsquo;s main app is FLUUS Pay, which is a regulated and compliant crypt on- and off-ramping service that integrates with fintech partners and money transfer networks. Using FLUUS Pay, someone without a bank account can bring their cash to one of its partner&rsquo;s physical offices and purchase crypto in minutes. Alternatively, they can sell their crypto and receive cash in their hands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FLUUS&rsquo;s second product FLUUS Connect is launching soon. Like FLUUS Pay, its purpose is to ease onboarding, but in this case it&rsquo;s aimed at application developers who want to integrate simple crypto on- and off-ramps within their own decentralized apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the most enticing aspects of FLUUS&rsquo;s technology is that it&rsquo;s already proven, with the company demonstrating its capabilities in a private trial involving an NGO that delivers humanitarian aid to Ukraine. That trial saw it off-ramp more than $1 million in crypto donations to charities and aid organizations working in Ukraine that desperately need that money.</p>
<p>Given its potential to impact millions of lives, $FLUUS is likely to be one of the hottest token launches we&rsquo;ll see this year. Buyers who want early access to the tokens can find it on the FantomStarter platform, a well known crypto launchpad that has previously hosted presales of successful projects like Wingswap and Chirpley. By buying $FLUUS tokens on FantomStarter, early investors are likely getting a very good deal, as the value of new tokens often increases significantly when they&rsquo;re listed publicly on popular cryptocurrency exchange platforms. $FLUUS will list on multiple exchanges from May 24 onwards.</p>
<p>The $FLUUS token, which is capped at a total supply of one billion, will serve as the main governance token of FLUUS, providing voting rights to holders and serving as collateral for the project&rsquo;s on- and off-ramping partners. In addition, users will be able to stake $FLUUS and provide capital in liquidity pools for the chance to earn rewards.</p>
<p>FLUUS chose to launch its presale on FantomStarter as a result of user demand, which was illustrated when it received the required 1 million votes to be included on its platform in just two days.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the second opportunity for early investors to acquire $FLUUS tokens. Such was the demand that in its first presale, on AllianceBlock&rsquo;s Fundrs platform, it sold out within three days of its launch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is the second opportunity for early investors to acquire $FLUUS tokens. Such was the demand that in its first presale, on AllianceBlock&rsquo;s Fundrs platform, it sold out within three days of its launch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The SEC has responded to Coinbase&rsquo;s request for clarity regarding crypto regulation and refuses to entertain the exchange&rsquo;s demands. </p>
<p>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) refuses to give in to Coinbase&rsquo;s request for immediate clarity of cryptocurrency regulations. On May 15, the SEC filed a brief in response to Coinbase&rsquo;s petition in April and said it is not prepared to provide clarity on current crypto regulations.</p>
<p>The agency argued it is under no obligation to meet the requirements set out in Coinbase&rsquo;s petition. It said the exchange requested complex rulemaking in an unreasonably short amount of time.</p>
<p>The SEC asked the court to deny Coinbase&rsquo;s petition for mandamus, arguing that it is an &ldquo;extraordinary remedy&rdquo; that Coinbase does not, and cannot, demonstrate a right to relief. The agency added that it is under no obligation to respond to or regulate crypto:</p>

<p>Neither the securities laws nor the Administrative Procedure Act (&ldquo;APA&rdquo;) impose on the Securities and Exchange Commission an obligation to issue the broad new regulations regarding &ldquo;digital assets&rdquo; Coinbase has requested.</p>

Coinbase Demands Clarity From the SEC
<p>Coinbase filed a narrow action on April 24, compelling the securities regulator to give a &lsquo;yes or no&rsquo; answer to a petition filed in July 2022, which went unanswered for nine months.</p>
<p>The 2022 petition outlines a list of questions seeking clarity on the nature of securities and how the SEC determines whether an asset is a security. Coinbase filed a previous petition on March 20 requesting the agency exclude staking from its list of securities.</p>
SEC Argues New Regulations Are Not Needed
<p>The SEC argued that new regulations are unnecessary as it deems digital assets securities. In its filing, the agency said:</p>

<p>The rulemaking petition as to which Coinbase seeks an immediate determination asks the Commission to take a series of discretionary actions to replace existing applicable securities laws and regulations with a comprehensive new regulatory regime for the trading of crypto assets that are securities.</p>

<p>In a Twitter thread early this morning, Paul Grewal, Coinbase&rsquo;s chief legal officer, said the filing might be the first time the SEC explains its views on whether the agency should create rules for the cryptocurrency industry. Grewal notes that there is still much left that needs clarification.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Today the SEC responded to Coinbase&rsquo;s petition for a writ of mandamus &mdash; asking the court to require the SEC to respond just yes or no to whether it will undertake rulemaking for our industry. The SEC&rsquo;s answer? A resounding maybe. 1/7</p>

<p>

</p>
<p>Grewal explained the SEC told the court that rulemaking may take years to conclude and the agency is in no rush. He added:</p>

<p>The SEC acknowledged that it will continue to use enforcement actions as a substitute for rulemaking for the foreseeable future, but not to worry &mdash; those enforcement actions may eventually &lsquo;inform&rsquo; not-yet-planned rulemaking.</p>

Chairman Gensler Stands Firm: The Rules Already Exist
<p>The agency&rsquo;s lack of willingness to engage with Coinbase&rsquo;s previous petitions and its response to the latest action conveys that Gary Gensler, chairman of the SEC, and his team are not interested in cooperating with cryptocurrency firms.</p>
<p>Chairman Gensler spoke at the Financial Markets Conference yesterday on May 15, responding to questions regarding the row between Coinbase and the SEC. Gensler said:</p>

<p>The rules have already been published.</p>
