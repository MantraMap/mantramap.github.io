<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The United States Attorney&#8217;s Office in the District of Manhattan has established an FTX task force to recover the assets of FTX victims.</em></li>



<li><em>The action came after the SBF refused to plead guilty in court on January 3.</em></li>



<li><em>The task force will include prosecutors from securities and commodities fraud, public corruption, money laundering, and transnational criminal enterprise divisions.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>The U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office in Manhattan said it had established the FTX Task Force to track and recover the assets of victims following the collapse of the crypto exchange and to deal with the investigations and prosecutions involving the company and other entities, according to CNBC.</strong></h5>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We are launching the SDNY FTX Task Force to ensure that this urgent work continues, powered by all of SDNY&#8217;s resources and expertise, until justice is done,&#8221; </p>
<cite>Manhattan U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement.</cite></blockquote>



<p>The announcement came after FTX founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried appeared in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, and<strong> <a href="https://news.coincu.com/157878-sam-bankman-fried-pleads-not-guilty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he declined to accept criminal charges of fraud</a> causing fraud. U.S. prosecutors previously brought forward FTX&#8217;s collapse.</strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;The Southern District of New York is working around the clock to respond to the implosion of FTX (…). It is an all-hands-on-deck moment,&#8221;</p>
<cite>He said</cite></blockquote>



<p><strong>The task force will include prosecutors from securities and commodities fraud, public corruption, money laundering, and transnational criminal enterprise divisions. Williams&#8217; senior deputy, Andrea Griswold, is leading the task force.</strong></p>



<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission has estimated that <strong>customers have lost more than $8 billion to fraud at FTX and Bankman-Fried&#8217;s hedge fund, Alameda Research.</strong></p>

<p>When FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November, it <strong>claimed to have more than 100,000 creditors and liabilities between $10 billion and $50 billion</strong>, compared with assets in the same range.</p>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fired is free but under house arrest at his parent&#8217;s residence on a<strong> $250 million personal bond</strong>.</p>



<p>In a court hearing yesterday, a U.S. court approved an amendment to SBF&#8217;s bail agreement that barred him from receiving or transferring money related to FTX or Alameda Research as a new bail condition.</p>



<p>The immediate reason for the modification was that approximately $1.7 million worth of tokens in the wallet linked to Alameda were sold on the open market a few days after Sam was released on bail.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Cryptocurrency firm Wyre admits close employees who were laid off after downsizing its operations.</em></li>



<li><em>The company planned to stop providing services this month.</em></li>



<li><em>The company is still operating on a small scale and preparing for the following plans.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>Cryptocurrency company Wyre admits close its employees. Two former employees of the company have confirmed this to <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/01/03/wyre-shutdown-crypto-winter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Axios</a>.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-253.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="776" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-253.png" alt="Wyre Admits Close And Plans To End Services January 2023" class="wp-image-157900" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-253.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-253-300x227.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-253-768x582.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-253-750x568.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Wyre Admits Close And Plans To End Services January 2023 6"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Wyre, a crypto payments company founded in 2013, has told employees it<strong> will shut down amid layoffs</strong>.</p>



<p>Two former employees confirmed the shutdown news. One noted that <strong>CEO Ioannis Giannaros had informed several via email over the holiday that the company would be liquidating and retiring and intends to terminate service in January 2023</strong>.</p>



<p>One person told Axios that the company has yet to offer a severance package, leading former workers to worry that there may be no package.</p>



<p>On December 31, another employee posted on LinkedIn about being fired, writing: &#8220;<strong>Wyre will not continue to be a profitable business.</strong>&#8220;</p>



<p>However, Giannaros told Axios via email, &#8220;We are still working but will be scaling back to plan the next steps.&#8221; He did not immediately respond to requests for further comment based on an employee&#8217;s request.</p>



<p>The reason for this action is believed to be the current crisis in the market. The sudden and rapid collapse of FTX has once again plunged the crypto industry into a cold winter.</p>



<p>Wyre and a series of significant crypto companies have also been hit hard by this crisis. The major crypto company, Blockfi, also had to file for bankruptcy shortly after the collapse of FTX. Or Genesis, a subsidiary of DCG, also caused a domino effect for Gemini in its partnership plan.</p>



<p><strong>Bolt previously announced the acquisition of Wyre for $1.5 billion</strong>, but that deal was dropped in September.</p>

<p>According to Crunchbase, Wyre has raised $29 million across nine funding rounds. Its backers include Samsung Next Ventures, Pantera Capital, and the Stellar Development Foundation.</p>

<p>The company, located in Castle Rock, Colorado, chose the name amid the bull market run in <strong>late 2017</strong>. The miner was previously known as <strong>Bioptix Inc.</strong>, a producer of diagnostic equipment for the biotech sector. <strong>Venaxis Inc.</strong> was the previous name of <strong>Bioptix</strong>.</p>

<p>Riot Platforms CEO <strong>Jason Les</strong> <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/01/03/2582242/0/en/Riot-Blockchain-Inc-Announces-Corporate-Rebranding-to-Riot-Platforms-Inc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> in a statement:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Our successful acquisitions of Whinstone U.S., which developed and operated North America&#8217;s largest dedicated Bitcoin mining data center facility, and ESS Metron, which enhanced our electrical component engineering and supply chain capabilities, have formed the foundation on which our teams have built, and will continue to develop, business platforms for further growth. The scope and scale of our businesses continues to expand, and this rebranding better reflects our position as strategic allocators of capital to broaden the scope of our Bitcoin-focused operations.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>One of the few mining companies, <strong>Riot Platforms</strong>, has been able to lower energy costs and counteract market headwinds by entering into power purchase agreements that allow it to sell the electricity it has already purchased at a profit back to the grid.</p>



<p>Miners have suffered from declining profitability over the past year, and this summer, <strong>Stronghold Digital Mining</strong> even <a href="https://news.coincu.com/157829-stronghold-17-9-million-debt-to-stock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">changed</a> the focus of its operations to selling power from mining. <strong>Core Scientific </strong>is also having financial problems as the bankruptcy process is underway.</p>

<p><strong>Sam Bankman-Fried</strong>, the disgraced cryptocurrency executive, returned to New York and<strong> pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to charges that he engaged in widespread fraud and other crimes</strong>, nearly two weeks after he was released by a Manhattan judge on a<strong> $250 million bond </strong>and ordered to stay with his parents in Palo Alto, California.</p>



<p>The cryptocurrency exchange he started, FTX, collapsed as a result of BankmanFried&#8217;s -fraud, according to allegations made against him in Federal District Court, where he is currently being tried for his role in the massive losses suffered by his clients.</p>



<p>The former crypto billionaire was charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and securities fraud, as well as<strong> separate counts of securities fraud and wire fraud, money laundering, and conspiracy to circumvent laws governing campaign finance.</strong></p>

<p>Bankman-Fried&#8217;s trial was scheduled to begin on<strong> October 2 </strong>before<strong> Judge Lewis Kaplan</strong>.</p>



<p>A swarm of cameras surrounded Bankman-Fried as soon as his black SUV pulled up outside the courthouse. Bankman-Fried&#8217;s mother was unable to get out of the car because of the crowd, and she fell to the wet sidewalk as cameras whirled around her in an attempt to capture a sight of her son.</p>

<p>Although the plea was expected, it gives the 30-year-old extra time, according to attorneys. Bankman-Fried will be able to properly prepare his next course of action after learning more about the prosecution&#8217;s case against him. The plea sets the case up for a protracted trial that might go on for <strong>at least four weeks</strong>.</p>



<p>According to federal prosecutor <strong>Danielle Sassoon</strong>, Bankman-Fried coordinated with foreign officials to transfer assets that FTX&#8217;s American management had been attempting to recoup through the Chapter 11 bankruptcy procedure.</p>



<p>Bahamian regulators contest the legitimacy of the Chapter 11 proceedings in the United States and assert that local laws grant them jurisdiction over those assets.</p>

<p>A battle over hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars worth of crypto has been going on in <strong>Delaware</strong> <strong>bankruptcy</strong> <strong>court</strong> for weeks between Bahamas regulators and FTX&#8217;s US attorneys. Attorneys for FTX believe that Bankman-Fried helped Bahamian regulators transfer hundreds of millions of dollars illegally.</p>



<p>The U.S. attorneys for FTX seem to concur with federal prosecutors. <strong>Sassoon</strong> requested that Kaplan establish a fresh prohibition against Bankman-Fried moving or gaining access to FTX client assets. The judge also granted such a motion.</p>

<p>In order to handle the investigation and prosecution of cases related to the collapse, a task force of senior prosecutors made up of members of units looking into money laundering, public corruption, securities, and commodities fraud, and transnational criminal enterprises have been formed, according to Manhattan US Attorney Damian Williams, who is leading the Bankman-Fried case. The task force will track and recover victim assets using the asset forfeiture and cyber capabilities of the office.</p>



<p>Bankman-Fried&#8217;s lawyers <a href="https://news.coincu.com/157835-bankman-fried-hide-bail-guarantors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">submitted</a> a motion earlier in the day to have the identities of the two people who had promised to see him released on bail with a bond sealed. They argued that the guarantors shouldn&#8217;t be subjected to the same scrutiny because the defendant and the case&#8217;s public profile had already put Bankman-Fried&#8217;s parents at risk. In court, Kaplan granted the motion.</p>

<p><strong>Judge</strong> <strong>Kaplan</strong> said he would approve the request, but he left the door open to revisiting it if there was a disagreement.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“I anticipate the possibility that the members of the media or others may wish to contest the sealing of that information,” Kaplan said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On December 9, Bankman-Fried was charged in federal court in New York. Three days after, at the request of US prosecutors, Bahamas law enforcement detained Bankman-Fried. Bankman-legal Fried&#8217;s team in the Bahamas wavered after his indictment on whether or not their client would agree to extradition.</p>

<li><em>Bankman-Fried&#8217;s attorneys requested that the court suppress the names and identifying details of the two co-signers who contributed to the former FTX CEO&#8217;s $250 million bail, in addition to his parents.</em></li>

<h5><strong>Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of FTX, requested that the judge maintain the identities of the two people who will assist in securing his bail a secret in order to shield them from prying eyes and possible persecution.</strong></h5>

<p>Bankman-Fried&#8217;s attorneys requested that the court suppress the names and identifying details of the two co-signers who contributed to the former FTX CEO&#8217;s <strong>$250 million bail</strong>, in addition to his parents.</p>



<p>The attorneys asked that their clients&#8217; identities be withheld due to privacy and safety concerns in the court documents submitted on Tuesday. According to the document, the U.S. government informed the lawyers that it had no opinion regarding the request.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Attorneys <strong>Mark S. Cohen </strong>and <strong>Christian R. Everdell</strong> of Cohen &amp; Gresser LLP wrote to presiding judge <strong>Lewis R. Kaplan</strong> stating that their request is justified because all information relevant to the court&#8217;s oversight of the bail proceedings will be made public, including the terms of bail, and that they are only seeking to prevent the public disclosure of identities.</p>

<p>After the bonds were signed on <strong>January 5</strong>, Bankman-Fried&#8217;s legal team asked that <strong>the court order names and other identifying information of two bail sureties not be made public and redacted from them</strong>. If the people&#8217;s personal information became public, Mark Cohen of the legal firm Cohen &amp; Gresser warned that they might experience harassment akin to that experienced by <strong>Barbara Fried</strong> and <strong>Joseph Bankman</strong>, the parents of the former FTX CEO.</p>



<p>According to the attorneys, <strong>Bankman-Fried&#8217;s parents have received a constant stream of threatening letters</strong>, including some wishing for them to be physically harmed. As a result, there is a substantial reason to worry that the two additional sureties will experience similar invasions of their privacy, threats, and harassment if their names appear on their bonds without being redacted or if their identities are somehow made public.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“If the two remaining sureties are publicly identified, they will likely be subjected to probing media scrutiny, and potentially targeted for harassment, despite having no substantive connection to the case. Consequently, the privacy and safety of the sureties are ‘countervailing factors’ that significantly outweigh the presumption of public access to the very limited information at issue,” Bankman-Fried’s lawyers wrote.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://news.coincu.com/157068-bankman-fried-crypto-wallets-targeted/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bankman-Fried</a> was charged with money laundering and conspiracy to commit wire fraud by the <strong>Southern District of New York</strong> after the startling failure of his multibillion-dollar cryptocurrency business in <strong>November</strong>.</p>

<p>The former FTX CEO was detained in the Bahamas in December and then extradited to the US. He is apparently <strong>planning to enter a not-guilty plea for the criminal allegations</strong>, which include wire fraud, securities fraud, and breaking campaign funding regulations, on <strong>January 3</strong>, when he physically appears in court.</p>



<p>The California home of Bankman-Fried parents and two other sureties served as the bail for his release after his court appearance on <strong>December 22</strong> in New York. In the days that followed his release, the methods used to acquire the bond for his bail were closely examined.</p>

<p>The Dedaub team observed that this issue was established due to Uniswap&#8217;s decision to introduce the Universal Router, which combines NFTs and ERC-20 tokens into a single swap router. According to their analysis, malevolent actors might embed a scripting language for all token activities.</p>

<p>After Uniswap re-deployed the <strong>Universal Route</strong>r and <strong>added &#8220;a re-entrancy lock to the core operation,&#8221;</strong> funds are now secure.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://defillama.com/protocol/uniswap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DefiLlama</a> data, the DEX currently manages <strong>$3.27 billion of assets</strong>, it is the largest by total value locked in DEXs.</p>

<p>Because of the way transactions are handled in account-based blockchains like <a href="https://news.coincu.com/157148-ethereum-gets-negative-figures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a>, the re-entrancy attack is a typical smart contracting mistake. Hackers have discovered this flaw over time and have stolen hundreds of millions of tokens.</p>



<p>For perspective, it should be noted that a re-entrancy attack was used to lock millions of ETH in the first-ever DAO in Ethereum, causing the network to split into the longer-chain Ethereum and the proof-of-work Ethereum classic.</p>



<p>In order to take advantage of this weakness, the attacker starts an endless loop between the weak smart contracts and their smart contract, draining the latter&#8217;s holdings of money. Once the transaction is accepted from the pool, the victim cannot recover funds because smart contracts are implemented on an immutable base layer.</p>



<p><strong>Dedaub</strong> was awarded a <strong>$40,000 bounty </strong>as part of the <strong>$3 million</strong> program that Uniswap launched.</p>

<p>Since 2009, a lot has happened to Bitcoin blocks. Instead of one transaction, they have thousands. Mine them takes ten minutes.</p>



<p>After three <strong>&#8220;halvings&#8221;</strong> of the reward, which take place about every four years according to a fixed timetable, miners are paid <strong>6.25 BTC</strong>.</p>



<p>The Bitcoin blockchain contained around <strong>750,000 blocks</strong> as of <strong>December 2022</strong>. They create a continuous series that dates all the way back to the <strong>Genesis</strong> <strong>Block</strong>, with each one expressly addressing the one before it.</p>



<p>Despite being the largest coin by market capitalization, the value of <strong>Bitcoin</strong> has declined along with the economic downturn and high inflation. At the time of writing, <a href="https://coincu.com/currencies/btc-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BTC</a> is trading at <strong>$16,632</strong>.</p>

<p>A new series of convertible preferred shares that can be converted into common shares for a price of <strong>40 cents per share</strong> will be given in place of the<strong> 10% </strong>convertible notes under the terms of the deal that was announced on Tuesday. The transaction is anticipated to finalize on <strong>February 20 </strong>and bring the company&#8217;s debt down to less than <strong>$55 million.</strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We acknowledge the significant number of shares of common stock that could be issued as a result of the Exchange Agreement, but we believe this is necessary to preserve cash, reduce our financial obligations, and better position the Company to survive a potentially prolonged crypto market downturn,&#8221; Beard said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to the firm, <strong>57.8 million common shares</strong> would be issued if all the preferred stock is converted, increasing the existing common float by around<strong> 46%</strong>. The new preferred shares won&#8217;t receive a dividend payment from <strong>Stronghold</strong>.</p>

<p>Like other companies in the sector, it has seen mining economics deteriorate due to a decline in Bitcoin prices and an increase in energy costs.</p>



<p><a href="https://news.coincu.com/154306-core-scientific-can-sell-mine-1-gigawatt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Core Scientific</a>, another Bitcoin miner, also has plans to convert the majority of its debt into equity after declaring bankruptcy last month.</p>



<p>During the summer, <strong>Stronghold</strong> moved its emphasis from mining to selling power. In <strong>Pennsylvania</strong>, the company owns and runs two waste coal plants. <strong>Stronghold</strong> had roughly <strong>6 Bitcoins </strong>and <strong>$12.4 million in unrestricted cash </strong>at the end of 2022.</p>

<p>Social media users&#8217; timelines are filled with references to <strong>Bonk</strong>. Airdrops, giveaways, memes, and comments on preserving and unifying the Solana community at this trying time are among the topics covered in the posts. However, among the numerous posts are also covert advertisements from shill accounts.</p>

<p>Despite this, interest in the project is growing, as shown by Bonk&#8217;s good price performance. So much so that Bonk was suggested as a potential platform integration candidate by <strong>Magic Eden</strong>, the largest NFT marketplace on Solana.</p>

<p>Although <strong>Bonk</strong> is gaining momentum, it is extremely possible that it will follow in the footsteps of other meme or dog-focused crypto tokens that frequently see a pump, a rapid drop, and little to no rebound. However, in the interim, it had assisted in the Solana ecosystem&#8217;s growth at a time when many crypto players believed it to be doomed.</p>

<p>According to a December 26 announcement, BTC.com <a href="https://news.coincu.com/155611-bit-mining-subsidiary-was-hacked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suffered</a> a <strong>$3 million</strong> loss of digital assets as a result of a <strong>cyberattack</strong> on <strong>December 3</strong>.</p>



<p>The event was reported by the company to Chinese legal enforcement in <strong>Shenzhen</strong>. Some of BTC.com’s digital assets have already been secured thanks to local and internal coordination.</p>



<p>On <strong>December 23, 2022</strong>, the authorities opened an inquiry, started gathering information, and asked pertinent entities for help and cooperation. The business will make significant attempts to recover the digital assets that were stolen.</p>



<p>After learning about this cyberattack, the company put technology in place to better stop and intercept hackers. With the exception of its services related to digital assets, <strong>BTC.com is now conducting business as normal.</strong></p>



<p>Cryptocurrency mixers like Tornado Cash are still used as tools for attackers to launder money. The US Treasury Department is re-listing sanctions on Tornado Cash, attaching mixers to North Korea&#8217;s nuclear weapons program. </p>



<p>The <strong>Treasury Department </strong><a href="https://news.coincu.com/140716-us-treasury-designate-tornado-cash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">countered</a> the argument that <strong>Tornado Cash </strong>and wallet addresses are software, not individuals or organizations, and therefore <strong>cannot be a sanctioned entity</strong>. Department makes clear an entity here can be a partnership, association… or other organization.</p>
