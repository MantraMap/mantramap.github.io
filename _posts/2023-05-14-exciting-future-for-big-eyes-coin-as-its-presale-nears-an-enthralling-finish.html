<p>The big development in cryptocurrency in 2023 seems increasingly likely to be the trajectory of Big Eyes Coin (BIG). As it closes out an impressive presale with one final special offer for investors not wanting to miss out, it&rsquo;s outlined a six-month roadmap charting its course to the crypto stars as it looks to become the biggest meme coin of them all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this article, we will look at all the reasons to be excited about Big Eyes Coin and also discuss how it compares to Floki Inu (FLOKI) and ApeCoin (APE).</p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin&rsquo;s Six-Month Roadmap Gives a Lot to be Excited About</p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin is making waves in the crypto world as it approaches the conclusion of its presale on June 3rd. The cat-themed meme coin has already generated an impressive $35 million in sales, leaving its rivals in awe. Offering a generous 300% bonus on all purchases with the code END300 until the end of its presale, Big Eyes Coin has utilised innovative methods to create and develop a strong community of investors.</p>
<p>The coin's success is due in part to its savvy use of social media, which has helped foster an inclusive atmosphere and promote its presale. Big Eyes Coin has employed a variety of strategies to boost earnings, such as offering loot boxes and time-limited bonus deals with bonus codes.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Big Eyes Coin has already outlined its plans for the future with a six&ndash;month roadmap to becoming a major force in the meme coin market, allowing it to challenge bigger and more established coins. To kick things off, the coin will be listed on Uniswap's (UNI) DEX on June 15th, with a potential CEX launch on Binance BNB (BNB) also in the works.</p>
<p>Over the next half-year, Big Eyes Coin has plans to list on several other exchanges including Gate.io, Bitget, BKEX, LBank, Deepcoin, and more. These listings will provide greater accessibility and exposure to the coin, attracting new investors and bolstering its position in the market.</p>
<p></p>
<p>By pursuing a multi-pronged approach to listing, Big Eyes Coin is positioning itself for long-term success in the meme coin market. The coin's development team is confident that these strategic moves will allow it to compete with other popular meme coins and capture a significant share of the market.</p>
<p>As part of its roadmap, on August 29th, it will launch its Big Casino, a gaming platform where users can win using BIG tokens. This exciting development is expected to further fuel demand for the coin, which is already being touted as a potential market leader once it goes live.</p>
<p>As a young project with impressive presale numbers, Big Eyes Coin is poised to make a big impact in the world of meme coins. Its unique approach to community building and innovative use of social media makes it a compelling choice for investors looking to capitalise on the latest fintech trends.</p>
<p>How Will It Compare to ApeCoin?</p>
<p>ApeCoin is a decentralised cryptocurrency that aims to provide a safe and secure platform for its users and has implemented several features whilst operating on the Ethereum network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its community is known for being very active and supportive with its team providing regular updates and engaging with its users. ApeCoin&rsquo;s ecosystem is widely regarded; its NFTs have been very successful and it has a reward system that innovatively encourages users to hold their tokens which can fuel demand for the APE currency.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Floki Inu is Powered by Its Incredible Community</p>
<p>If there is a coin that BIG can learn from it&rsquo;s Floki Inu. As a fellow community-driven meme coin, it&rsquo;s grown in popularity recently. It operates on the Ethereum network and has a fascinating ecosystem that includes a diverse range of fascinating features.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ecosystem comprises its Valhalla Play 2 Earn metaverse, its hub for DeFi projects known as FlokiFi, an NFT and merchandise marketplace called Flokiplaces. In addition, it includes its University of Floki which offers a richly detailed crypto education platform. There is reportedly a total circulation of 8.9 trillion FLOKI tokens with a maximum supply of 20 trillion and a market capitalization of $335 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the forefront of Floki Inu&rsquo;s sharp ascent is its ardent community known as the Floki Vikings.&nbsp;</p>
