<p>Binance announced it created a cryptocurrency trading platform for Japanese residents set to launch this summer. </p>
<p>Cryptocurrency exchange Binance announced the launch of a crypto trading platform for Japanese residents. The world&rsquo;s largest crypto exchange said the platform would fully comply with Japanese crypto regulations.</p>
<p>Binance said:</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that we have created a new platform for residents in Japan in order to fully comply with local regulations.</p>

<p>Adding,</p>

<p>The new platform will be available this summer. We will inform the launch date and provide further details in the coming months.</p>

Binance Will Suspend Use of its Global Platform to Japanese Residents
<p>As part of the transition to Binance Japan, the exchange announced it would discontinue its crypto services for Japanese residents through its global platform by November 30, 2023.</p>
<p>The exchange further announced that users of its global platform would be able to move over to its new platform, which will be available after August 1, 2023:</p>

<p>Users of the global platform will be able to migrate to the new local platform through a new identity verification process (KYC), which will be available after August 1, 2023.</p>

Japan&rsquo;s Stance On Digital Assets and Blockchain Technology
<p>The Japanese government published a white paper in September 2022, which has since been approved, discussing implementing blockchain technology and CBDCs into its existing governance and technological frameworks.</p>
<p>The country has been embracing crypto rapidly, and as a result, several Japanese firms, including Toyota, Sony and NTT, have expressed a desire to embark on &ldquo;various decentralized offerings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Japan proved itself to be a significant player in the global crypto market and, as such, needs to address potential risks associated with the industry.</p>
<p>Most recently, the government announced it would enforce strict new AML measures across the crypto industry, set to take force from June 1, 2023.</p>
<p>Japan, as a member state of the G7, will further enforce the implementation of the &ldquo;Travel Rule&rsquo; established by the international financial watchdog, Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The &ldquo;Travel Rule,&rdquo; extensively discussed at the recent G7 summit hosted in Japan, requires financial institutions processing crypto transfers over $3,000 to disclose customer information with the recipient exchange or institution.</p>
<p>Japan&rsquo;s new regulatory framework further requires crypto exchanges registered in the country to verify customer identity and maintain detailed transaction records in line with AML standards.</p>
<p>The country&rsquo;s Financial Services Agency (FSA) will oversee compliance with the new framework.</p>
