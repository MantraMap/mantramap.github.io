<p>Regulations and lawsuits have become the bane of the crypto market&rsquo;s existence in the past few months. However, in a somewhat unexpected turn of events, this morning, we saw both Bitcoin (BTC) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) surge in price.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And as both tokens&rsquo; prices continue to go up, both Bitcoin (BTC) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) join Tradecurve (TCRV) as the top three best cryptocurrencies to buy now. But TCRV leads the way with its never-before-seen utility and game-changing potential.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
Bitcoin (BTC)&rsquo;s Unexpected Surge
<p>Before settling at its current price, Bitcoin (BTC) temporarily shot up to $138,000 Binance earlier today. However, this doesn&rsquo;t depict the real Bitcoin (BTC) price, as it was probably caused by a glitch and was gone in a few seconds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regardless, Bitcoin (BTC) holders were pleasantly surprised to see Bitcoin (BTC) surge this morning, increasing by almost $2,000 per Bitcoin (BTC) token compared to two days ago.</p>
<p>Now, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $28,972.09, an 8.16% increase in the past 24 hours. The Bitcoin (BTC) market cap and trading volume are also up by 8.19% and 80.65%, respectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
Shiba Inu (SHIB) Is Recovering
<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB) has become one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy again, as it managed to finally break out of its downward streak.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This surge in price can be attributed to Shiba Inu (SHIB) whales, who recently moved 21 billion SHIB over to Binance. However, even though Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently on the come-up, you should keep in mind that maybe those billions of Shiba Inu (SHIB) have been moved to be sold later on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading at $0.000007367, a 2.41% increase since yesterday. The Shiba Inu (SHIB) market cap is also up by 2.51%, and the Shiba Inu (SHIB) trading volume is up by 41.53%.</p>
<p></p>
