<h2>Senator Urges Congress to Crack Down on Crypto Money Laundering</h2>
<p>U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said in an interview with Politico&#8217;s Morning Money Wednesday that cracking down on money laundering activities is her &#8220;main focus&#8221; in terms of crypto-related legislation.</p>
<p>The senator confirmed that she will reintroduce her bill titled &#8220;Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2022.&#8221; Originally introduced in December last year, this bill is &#8220;the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-senators-unveil-new-crypto-bill-experts-call-it-the-most-direct-attack-on-personal-freedom-and-privacy-of-crypto-users/">most direct attack</a>&#8221; on the personal freedom and privacy of crypto users, according to experts in the field.</p>
<p>Warren explained that money laundering is &#8220;not nearly as visible to the public&#8221; as fraud. &#8220;It occurs in the darkest shadows of the crypto world, but its impact on our national security and law enforcement is immense. … The current legal structure essentially holds up a giant sign over crypto that says, money laundering done here,&#8221; the senator described, elaborating:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is not about inventing any new form of anti-money laundering rules. This is about applying exactly the same set of rules that apply across every other financial industry.</p></blockquote>
<p>The chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, has also said that crypto should be <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chairman-says-crypto-should-be-treated-same-as-other-capital-markets/">treated the same</a> as other capital markets.</p>

<h2>Senator Warren Wants Congress to Empower Regulators to Be Effective &#8216;Cop on the Beat&#8217;</h2>
<p>&#8220;There are two very different kinds of crypto problems,&#8221; Warren continued, noting that &#8220;one is consumer fraud.&#8221; The senator stressed: &#8220;That&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve seen when FTX and other exchanges collapsed. It&#8217;s part of the pump and dump and rug pulls, and all the other ways that customers get cheated.&#8221; Emphasizing that both Congress and regulators need to take action, she detailed:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are a lot of regulatory tools out there already to deal with that. We need regulators to use those tools, and Congress needs to make sure that those regulators have the resources they need to be an effective cop on the beat.</p></blockquote>
<p>SEC Chair Gensler has often <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chairman-says-crypto-should-be-treated-same-as-other-capital-markets/">said</a> that the securities regulator &#8220;will serve as the cop of the beat&#8221; and bring enforcement actions against uncompliant crypto firms. Senator Warren has been pushing for the SEC to impose <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-senator-warren-presses-sec-to-address-crypto-exchange-outages-high-transaction-fees-financial-inclusion/">tougher rules</a> on the crypto sector and use its full authority to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-senator-warren-presses-sec-to-use-full-authority-to-regulate-cryptocurrency-trading/">regulate crypto trading</a>.</p>
<p>Warren has long been a crypto skeptic. She has warned about &#8220;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-senator-warren-benefits-cryptocurrency-run-on-crypto-need-federal-bailout/">a run on crypto</a>&#8221; that may need a federal bailout and has repeatedly raised concerns about the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/elizabeth-warren-queries-bitcoin-mining-operation-us-senator-says-crypto-miners-raise-environmental-concerns/">environmental</a> impact of bitcoin mining. She wants Congress and the Treasury to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/senator-warren-treasury-secretary-yellen-urgently-adopt-policy-mitigate-cryptocurrencies-risks/">urgently adopt</a> a policy to mitigate crypto risks. Following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, she also urged Fidelity Investments to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-senators-urge-fidelity-to-stop-offering-bitcoin-in-401k-plans-citing-ftx-collapse-serious-problems-in-crypto-industry/">stop offering</a> bitcoin as an option in 401(k) retirement accounts.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Difficulty Reaches New All-Time High as Mining Gets Tougher</h2>
<p>Bitcoin&#x2019;s difficulty reached another all-time high, surpassing the record set two weeks ago, after <a href="https://btc.com/stats/diff">rising 4.68%</a> on Sunday. The increase occurred at block height <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/block/774144">774,144</a>, at 6:10 a.m. (UTC). The difficulty is now at 39.35 trillion, close to surpassing 40 trillion. The next adjustment is due Feb. 11, 2023.</p>

<p>The rise makes mining blocks more difficult, following a 4.68% jump after the 10.26% increase on Jan. 15, 2023. Jan. 29 statistics show a hashrate of 279.7 exahash per second (EH/s) over the last 2,016 blocks, currently at <a href="https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/bitcoin/hashrate-chart">283.55 EH/s</a> dedicated to the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.macromicro.me/charts/29435/bitcoin-production-total-cost">Statistics</a> from macromicro.me on Jan. 28, 2023, estimate the cost of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> production at $21,176 per unit. On Jan. 29, the spot price was $23,584. With spot prices higher than the cost of production, bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) miners have recouped some losses from the end of 2022.</p>

<p><a href="https://btc.com/stats/pool">Pool distribution</a> calculated by blocks discovered shows Foundry USA as the top mining pool with 101.47 EH/s, equating to 34.89% of the network&#x2019;s hashpower. Antpool has 57.54 EH/s, or 19.79% of the total network hashrate. F2pool, Binance Pool, Viabtc, Btc.com, and Braiins Pool follow Foundry and Antpool, respectively.</p>
<p>With the increase in difficulty, block intervals, or the time between each <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> block, have been about <a href="https://www.bitcoinsensus.com/bitcoin-halving-countdown/">9:02</a> to <a href="https://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com/dashboard/">9:38</a> minutes. This is slower than the recent <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-difficulty-set-to-rise-3-82-to-all-time-high-of-39-trillion-following-recent-increase/">8:54 to 9:31 minutes</a> recorded two days ago, but still faster than the 10-minute average.</p>

In three days, on Feb. 1, 2023, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is set to convene. While the market expects rate cuts, some analysts think the Fed will continue raising the federal funds rate. Chris Vermeulen, the founder and chief investment officer of The Technical Traders, insists the S&amp;P 500 is due to slide 37% lower than its current position.</strong></p>
<h2>Strategist Predicts Potential Market Correction as Powell&#8217;s Re-tightening of Financial Conditions is Anticipated</h2>
<p>Markets are closely watching the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, scheduled to occur on Wednesday, Feb. 1, three days from now. Last week, Bitcoin.com News <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/all-eyes-on-the-next-fed-meeting-market-trajectories-hinge-on-decision/">reported</a> on how investors are closely following the decision of Jerome Powell, the 16th chairman of the Federal Reserve. As the FOMC meeting approaches, discussions about the outcome have been widespread on social media.</p>
<p>A market strategist known as &#8220;The Carter&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/TheCarter758/status/1618898403609706496?s=20&amp;t=i0atx_pNiW8WUHWVwN5EBg">explained</a> on Jan. 27 that &#8220;there will be blood on February 1,&#8221; referring to the turmoil that markets may face after Powell addresses the nation. While some investors are expecting a dovish Fed and possible rate cuts, Carter argues that Powell will instead continue to tighten and implement restrictive policy.</p>
<p>The analyst <a href="https://twitter.com/TheCarter758/status/1618899572230868992?s=20&amp;t=i0atx_pNiW8WUHWVwN5EBg">notes</a> that Powell has previously referred to a &#8220;broader tightening project&#8221; in three stages: rapid hikes to reach a neutral rate, measured hikes to reach a &#8220;sufficiently restrictive&#8221; rate and staying at the terminal rate for some time. &#8216;U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will re-tighten financial conditions by forcefully addressing rate cuts head-on,&#8217; Carter stressed in a Twitter thread.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-571307" title="Market Strategist Warns of 'Blood' on February 1 Ahead of Fed Meeting" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/jon56.jpg" alt="Market Strategist Warns of 'Blood' on February 1 Ahead of Fed Meeting" width="565" height="420" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/jon56-300x223.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/jon56-1024x760.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/jon56-768x570.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/jon56.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 565px) 100vw, 565px" /></p>
<p>The strategist expects that the Fed chair will address this topic forcefully on Feb. 1 and shift the conversation towards how long the Fed needs to hold at the terminal rate and why. “Look for him to expand on the lessons of the 1970s,” Carter <a href="https://twitter.com/TheCarter758/status/1618915326527422464?s=20&amp;t=i0atx_pNiW8WUHWVwN5EBg">wrote</a>. “Why the market continues to punch Powell in the face and not expect a counter-punch is beyond me. This is the craziest market set-up right here, right now. There will be blood on February 1.”</p>
<h2>Expert Predicts 37% Drop in S&amp;P 500, While Gold and Silver Set to Shine in Bearish Market</h2>
<p>Speaking with David Lin, anchor and producer at Kitco News, <a href="https://thetechnicaltraders.com/our-team/">Chris Vermeulen</a>, founder and chief investment officer of The Technical Traders, <a href="https://youtu.be/eIux2t5c-gw">said</a> that stocks are due for a correction.</p>
<p>&#8220;I honestly think that the S&amp;P 500 could fall another potential 37 percent, roughly, from current levels,&#8221; Vermeulen told Lin. &#8220;That is enough to create a lot of damage, a lot of stress, lots of bankruptcies, you name it,&#8221; he added. In contrast, Vermeulen expects gold and silver to shine throughout the bearish market. &#8220;This is when precious metals and miners take off,&#8221; Vermeulen insisted while discussing market cycles.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-571310 size-full" title="Market Strategist Warns of 'Blood' on February 1 Ahead of Fed Meeting" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/kiytuiii.jpg" alt="Market Strategist Warns of 'Blood' on February 1 Ahead of Fed Meeting" width="1280" height="600" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/kiytuiii-300x141.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/kiytuiii-1024x480.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/kiytuiii-768x360.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/kiytuiii.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>Vermeulen is not the only investor who believes gold and silver are set to take off. In December 2022, the manager of the AuAg ESG Gold Mining ETF, Eric Strand, said that gold will see a new all-time high in 2023 and central banks like the Federal Reserve will pivot on rate increases.</p>
<p>“It is our opinion that central banks will pivot on their rate hikes and become dovish during 2023, which will ignite an explosive move for gold for years to come,” Strand <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/03/gold-surges-to-6-month-high-and-analysts-expect-new-records-in-2023.html">said</a>. “We therefore believe gold will end 2023 at least 20% higher, and we also see miners outperforming gold with a factor of two.”</p>

<p>While gold has been on the rise and 2023 expectations are high, Harry Dent, the founder of HS Dent Investment Management, has a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/gold-to-lose-its-shine-as-harry-dent-predicts-massive-crash-bitcoin-to-follow-suit-with-low-of-3250/">contrarian view</a> about gold&#8217;s performance this year. Dent predicts the yellow precious metal could lose $900 to $1,000 over the next 18 months.</p>

Since interest peaked and Microsoft invested billions into Chatgpt, demand for AI-focused cryptocurrency projects has risen dramatically. For example, the crypto project Fetch.ai has seen its native token FET rise 212% in the past 30 days, and another AI project, Singularitynet, has seen it&#8217;s token AGIX increase 293% against the U.S. dollar.</strong></p>
<h2>There&#8217;s Been a Surge in Interest in AI-Focused Cryptocurrency Projects</h2>
<p>During the week of Jan. 22-28, 2023, the worldwide Google Trends score for the <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=AI">term &#8220;AI&#8221;</a> was 94 out of 100. In the first week of Dec. 2022, the search term reached its highest Google Trends score of 100. It&#8217;s safe to say that the world has become increasingly focused on artificial intelligence (AI) since the release of AI-infused art platforms like Dall-E, Deep AI, Jasper Art, Starry AI, Nightcafe, and others. In the past two months, the Openai platform Chatgpt or GPT-3 has become a widely used AI phenomenon.</p>
<p>Google Trends shows the worldwide score for the search <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=Chatgpt">term &#8220;Chatgpt&#8221;</a> was 100 during the week of Jan. 22-28, 2023, and it has been rising since the first week of Dec. 2022. <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/01/23/microsoftandopenaiextendpartnership/">Reports</a> also show that Microsoft has entered the third phase of its long-term partnership with <a href="https://openai.com">Openai</a> through a &#8220;multi-year, multi-billion dollar investment,&#8221; <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/qai/2023/01/19/microsoft-considers-investing-10-billion-in-openai-maker-of-chatgpt-heres-what-it-means-for-investors/?sh=72f7c235154a">said</a> to be as much as $10 billion in funding. The growing trend in artificial intelligence (AI) and demand for the technology has spilled over to blockchain projects integrating AI into their protocols.</p>
<p>For instance, a crypto asset created by the project <a href="https://singularitynet.io">singularitynet.io</a> has seen its native token AGIX rise 293% in the past month. Although <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/singularitynet">singularitynet (AGIX)</a> was down more than 6% on Jan. 29, 2023, it has increased 17.5% over the past two weeks. The project aims to support the next generation of decentralized AI. Another blockchain-powered AI project, Vectorspace AI (<a href="https://vectorspacebio.science">vspb.science</a>), has a token called <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/vectorspace-ai">VXV</a> that has risen 95.9% over the past month. The <a href="https://fetch.ai">Fetch.ai</a> project has experienced similar demand over the past four weeks.</p>

<p>Over the past 30 days, the Fetch.ai project&#8217;s <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/fetch-ai">FET token</a> has risen 212% against the U.S. dollar. The Fetch.ai team says the project creates &#8220;autonomous agent technology&#8221; for peer-to-peer applications with automation and AI capabilities, with or without direct blockchain access.” Another AI-based blockchain project, <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a>, and its <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ocean-protocol">OCEAN token</a> have risen 130% against the U.S. dollar in the past 30 days. Ocean Protocol, named a technology pioneer by the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/world-economic-forum-wef-believes-crypto-has-a-future-in-the-hands-of-responsible-actors/">World Economic Forum</a>, aims to unlock data at scale through encrypted data monetization.</p>
<p>It is uncertain how long the demand for AI-based crypto assets and the popularity of these tokens will last. All of the AI-related crypto assets are currently ranked below the top 75 in terms of market capitalization and have recently seen price surges due to increased interest in AI/Chatgpt.</p>

Approximately one year later, the search term &#8220;NFT&#8221; reached its highest score on Google Trends. During that time the top five NFT collections, in terms of all-time sales volume, have collectively accrued $12.7 billion in sales volume.</strong></p>
<h2>5 Non-Fungible Token Projects Capture $12.7 Billion in Sales</h2>
<p>Two years ago, the search query &#8220;NFT&#8221; first appeared on Google Trends (GT), reaching a score of <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=NFT">1 out of 100</a> in the first month of 2021. Before that time, GT data shows little to no interest in NFTs, despite their existence <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/nilicoins-rare-pepe-and-curio-cards-a-look-at-the-og-collectibles-that-started-the-nft-madness/">since 2014</a>. A year later, NFTs were quite popular and the search query reached a score of 100 as searches for the term skyrocketed. Another year later, interest in NFTs has decreased significantly, with the search query reaching a score of 11 out of 100 during the week of January 22-28, 2023.</p>

<p>As January 2023 ends, metrics indicate that the top five NFT collections by all-time sales volume have recorded a total of $12.7 billion in sales volume since they began receiving significant attention. According to <a href="https://dappradar.com/nft/collections">data</a> from dappradar.com, the leader in NFT sales volume over the last two years is Axie Infinity, which has amassed $4.27 billion in sales volume. On January 28, 2023, dappradar.com reports that Axie Infinity&#8217;s market capitalization was $1.37 million. The website explains that &#8220;market capitalization is equal to the floor price multiplied by the collection total supply.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cryptopunks follows Axie Infinity in overall sales volume, having accumulated $3.02 billion in all-time sales volume. Its current market valuation is larger than Axie&#8217;s market capitalization, at $1.04 billion. According to data, 7,503 traders have traded Cryptopunks NFTs in 23,259 sales. Next in the top collections is Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), with $2.39 billion in all-time sales volume. BAYC has recorded 31,225 sales among 15,176 traders. Its current market capitalization is slightly lower than Cryptopunk&#8217;s, at $1.02 billion.</p>

<p>The fourth largest NFT collection in terms of all-time sales is Mutant Ape Yacht Club, with $1.66 billion. Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) has an overall market capitalization of around $427 million, and 47,744 sales have been recorded among 30,475 MAYC traders. The fifth-largest NFT collection in terms of all-time sales is Artblocks, with $1.36 billion in global sales volume. Its current market capitalization is around $143 million, and the project has seen 227,294 sales recorded among 54,842 traders. While all five NFT collections have amassed $12.7 billion in sales volume, their collective value is around $2.619 billion.</p>

<h2>Federal Reserve Board Says Business Model Proposed by Custodia Bank Presents Risks</h2>
<p>Crypto bank Custodia has been denied membership in the United States Federal Reserve System. In an announcement dated Jan. 27, the Federal Reserve Board explained that the application, as submitted by the company, is “inconsistent with the required factors under the law.”</p>
<p>The press release further detailed that Custodia is a special purpose depository institution which does not have federal deposit insurance and wants to engage in “untested crypto activities,” including issuing a crypto asset. In that context, the Board argued:</p>
<blockquote><p>The firm’s novel business model and proposed focus on crypto-assets presented significant safety and soundness risks.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Federal Reserve Board reminded it had previously determined that “such crypto activities are highly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices.” It also said the bank’s risk management framework, “including its ability to mitigate money laundering and terrorism financing risks,” was not sufficient to address relevant concerns.</p>

<p>“In light of these and other concerns, the firm’s application as submitted was inconsistent with the factors the Board is required to evaluate by law,” the body concluded in the statement, adding that the order will be released following a review for confidential information.</p>
<p>Membership in the Federal Reserve System would have given Custodia, a bank chartered by the state of Wyoming, certain benefits, in terms of taxation and investment, for example. In a <a href="https://twitter.com/custodiabank/status/1619009284314120192" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted statement</a>, CEO Caitlin Long said the company was “surprised and disappointed” by the Board’s move, insisting:</p>
<blockquote><p>Custodia offered a safe, federally-regulated, solvent alternative to the reckless speculators and grifters of crypto that penetrated the U.S. banking system, with disastrous results for some banks.</p></blockquote>
<p>Long emphasized that Custodia actively sought federal regulation, “going above and beyond all requirements that apply to traditional banks.” She also noted that the denial is consistent with the concerns raised by the company about the Fed’s handling of its applications and vowed that the bank will continue to litigate the issue.</p>
<p>The executive was referring to a lawsuit filed by Custodia against the central bank system’s delayed ruling on its application for a master account. The latter remains pending, as the company pointed out on Twitter. Banks hold most of their reserves in master accounts at the Fed which allows them to make transfers between each other and settle payments.</p>
<p>Also on Friday, the Federal Reserve Board issued a policy statement, according to which both insured and uninsured banking institutions will be <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-federal-reserve-board-issues-policy-statement-that-limits-banks-crypto-related-activities/">subjected to limits</a> on certain activities, including those associated with crypto assets.</p>

The Bank of Ghana said its sandbox will also support innovations that attempt to solve the financial exclusion challenge. </strong></p>
<h2>Solving the Financial Exclusion Challenge</h2>
<p>The Ghanaian central bank has called on registered financial institutions and unlicensed fintech startups to apply for admission into its regulatory sandbox. In a press <a href="https://www.bog.gov.gh/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/PRESS-RELEASE-BANK-OF-GHANA-REGULATORY-SANDBOX-INVITATION-TO-APPLY-26-01-23.pdf">statement</a> issued on Jan. 26, the bank said the process to admit the first cohort of participants will open on Feb. 13 and close on March 14.</p>
<p>According to the Bank of Ghana (BOG), the sandbox will support innovations that include &#8220;new digital business models not currently covered explicitly or implicitly under any regulation.&#8221; The sandbox will also support innovations that attempt to solve the financial exclusion challenge as well as &#8220;new and immature digital financial service technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>As <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ghana-central-bank-announces-launch-of-regulatory-sandbox/">reported</a> by Bitcoin.com news, Ghana&#8217;s central bank launched the sandbox, which was developed in collaboration with Emetech Solutions Inc, on Aug. 22, 2022. At the time, the bank characterized the sandbox launch as proof of its &#8220;commitment to providing the enabling environment for innovation to promote financial inclusion, and facilitate Ghana’s digitization and cash-lite agenda.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p>As per the press release, interested participants are required to submit a complete form which can be accessed via a link. The statement adds prospective participants will be informed of the outcome of their respective applications &#8220;within twenty-one (21) working days after the closure of the application window on 14th March 2023.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the BOG’s Nigerian counterpart, the Central Bank of Nigeria, recently said its own regulatory sandbox is now live. The bank said interested innovators can now submit &#8220;expressions of interest to participate in the regulatory sandbox to explore novel applications of technology and innovation on behalf of our customers and stakeholders.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/cenbank/status/1618160760655613952">video</a> shared via Twitter, the Nigerian central bank said all entities with innovative financial solutions can apply online.</p>

In addition, 65% of institutional investors surveyed agree that bitcoin could reach $100,000.</strong></p>
<h2>&#x2018;Strong Year Ahead for Bitcoin&#x2019;</h2>
<p>Nickel Digital Asset Management published the results of a survey Thursday showing how high institutional investors expect the price of bitcoin to reach. The London-based investment manager is registered with the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).</p>
<p>The survey, commissioned by Nickel and conducted by market research company Pureprofile this month, interviewed 200 institutional investors and wealth managers across the U.S., U.K., Germany, Singapore, Switzerland, UAE, and Brazil. The respondents collectively managed around $2.85 trillion in assets.</p>
<p>Sharing the results of the survey, Nickel detailed:</p>
<blockquote><p>Professional investors are forecasting a strong year ahead for bitcoin and are confident about its long-term valuation. Nearly nine out of 10 professional investors predict bitcoin price rise this year. Two out of three agree $100,000 valuation is possible but only for long-term investors.</p></blockquote>
<p>Regarding the price of bitcoin, the asset manager described, &#x201C;The study found high levels of confidence about the long-term trend of the cryptocurrency,&#x201D; adding that 23% forecasted that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> will exceed $30,000 by the end of 2023.</p>
<p>Furthermore, 65% of institutional investors surveyed agree bitcoin could still hit $100,000 in the long term. Among them, 58% expect <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> to reach this price level within three to five years while 25% say it would take five or more years.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, 39% of total respondents predicted that the price of bitcoin will reach its November 2021 peak of $69,000 within three years while 76% said it will likely happen within five years. &#x201C;Only 3% questioned whether bitcoin will ever reach previous all-time high again,&#x201D; the asset management firm noted.</p>
<p>Nickel CEO Anatoly Crachilov commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>Price predictions in the cryptocurrency market is always a daunting task, however the most significant finding in our survey is that only 3% of investors are questioning bitcoin&#x2019;s future.</p></blockquote>

Its first task will be to address recent problems with some cryptocurrency exchanges and boost confidence in the industry as a whole.</strong></p>
<h2>New Entity to Deal With Issues in the Crypto Space in Turkey, Hopes to Increase Transparency</h2>
<p>People trading cryptocurrencies in Turkey have been estimated at over 8 million as of 2022, according to Emrah Inanc, head of the Crypto Industry Development, Monitoring and Reporting Association. The country is in the world’s top five in terms of crypto investments, he highlighted.</p>
<p>Speaking to the Anadolu Agency, the top executive of the newly-founded organization also emphasized that transparency is crucial for the development of the crypto sector. That’s why it will first focus efforts on solving problems with crypto exchanges and improve confidence in the industry.</p>
<p>Inanc pointed out that a number of exchanges from the Far East have been trying to attract Turkish customers. On this backdrop, he noted that the lack of rules and regulatory authority has led to “inconvenient results,” and acknowledged some of the challenges in relations with the public sector:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are faced with allegations that some exchanges have blocked customer accounts illegally for financing terrorism and money laundering.</p></blockquote>

<p>Emrah Inanc also indicated that the association is ready to periodically and transparently share information about the shortcomings it’s identifying with all relevant institutions. He also warned traders about dealings with offshore exchange platforms.</p>
<p>“In order to prevent these illegal practices and irregularities, we will take the necessary steps to block cryptocurrency exchanges … that cause unlawful transactions, cause victimization, and threaten our citizens and the country’s economy,” Inanc elaborated. He also urged both individuals and organizations to send requests, suggestions, and complaints to the group by filling out a form posted on its <a href="https://cexreport.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a>.</p>
<p>With the popularity of cryptocurrencies growing amid high inflation, Turkey has become an attractive market for crypto exchanges in the past few years. Turkish traders were also affected by a few failures in the sector, including that of FTX which filed for bankruptcy in mid-November. Turkey’s financial watchdog launched a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/turkeys-financial-intelligence-unit-launches-investigation-into-ftx-collapse/">probe</a> into the collapse of the major exchange as it had a Turkish platform.</p>
<p>Several domestic exchanges have also shut down, such as <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/albanian-court-approves-extradition-of-crypto-exchange-thodex-founder-to-turkey/">Thodex</a>, whose founders and top executives were accused of committing fraud and money laundering as part of a suspected <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/turkish-crypto-exchange-exit-scam-ceo-flees-country-people-detained-users-cannot-access-2-billion-funds/">exit scam</a>. Vebitcoin was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/2-turkish-crypto-exchanges-investigated-fraud-central-bank-bans-cryptocurrency-use-payments/">investigated</a> when it ceased activities after the country’s central bank <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/turkey-bans-cryptocurrency-use-payments-local-currency-plunges/">banned</a> crypto payments, and Coinzo <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/major-turkish-crypto-exchange-coinzo-shuts-down/">closed down</a> as well.</p>
