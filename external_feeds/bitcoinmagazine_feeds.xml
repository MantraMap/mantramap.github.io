This is the second <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/crypto-winter-6504445">“crypto winter</a>” for my company, which produces Bitcoin mining containers.</p><p>In this article, I will share the story of how our Bitcoin mining company survived its first crypto winter, and is now surviving its second (as well as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021%E2%80%932023_global_energy_crisis">world’s ongoing energy crisis</a>), and what we think will happen with the energy and crypto mining industries in the future.</p><h2>Our First Crypto Winter</h2><p><a href="https://ezblockchain.net/cases/">Our company</a> was launched in the first quarter of 2017 as a data center hosting solution with a mission to bring the best technology to Bitcoin miners.</p><p>We suffered a knock-on effect and initiated widespread redundancies as we struggled amid the looming cryptocurrency crash of the time. But we were still young, so our company had little to lose. We had only five employees and we had to learn to survive, mainly by managing cost and operating in a lean and mean way.</p><h2>Surviving Our Second Crypto Winter</h2><p>We arrived at the second crypto winter as one of the world's largest Bitcoin mining container producers (producing 10 containers every week). We have been one of the pioneers in utilizing wasted flared gas energy for Bitcoin mining and had built 10 cryptocurrency mining facilities across eight states and Canada, operating with more than 200 megawatts (MWs) of power. </p><p>But 2022 was among the most challenging years for us and the entire Bitcoin mining industry. It was characterized by declining bitcoin prices and rising energy costs, influenced by the energy crisis provoked by the war in Ukraine. Many mining <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-miner-capitulation-could-set-price-bottom">companies declared bankruptcy</a>, and those that survived had to reconsider their operations.</p><p>Some companies managed to survive in a year-long crypto winter, one that is arguably not over yet, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/record-bitcoin-mining-despite-bear-market">record mining difficulty</a> and completely-frozen funding. From my six years of experience running a Bitcoin infrastructure company, there are a few solutions I can share that I hope will help others or offer insight into how resilient Bitcoin mining can be. This should not be considered a panacea for market downturns or managerial advice, but simply what I have learned for myself. </p><h2>First, We Called Our Power Providers </h2><p>The bull run over the last few years has shown that Bitcoin miners prioritize acquiring miners over securing relationships with utilities.</p><p>But we believe that prioritizing the securing of power, and all of the infrastructure behind it, is critical. Last year, the bankruptcies of mining companies taught us just that. Having open communications with power providers on realistic expectations always helps sketch a clear plan for getting power flowing safely and on time. </p><p>There are multiple reasons why utilities are incentivized to sell power to Bitcoin mining companies: First, they make a profit on every kilowatt-hour (kWh) sold. However, giving more incentives to the electricity supplier, such as load flexibility, the high-capacity factor and controlled load increase, helps build a stronger foundation among integral partners in the Bitcoin mining industry. From my experience, power providers do not see Bitcoin miners any differently than other electricity consumers, as long as the bills are paid on time. </p><p>When the energy crisis hit us, the first thing we did was to call our power company partners and tell them that all the bills would be paid. We started to run the extra mile, investing in relationships with them.</p><h2>Take A Hands-On Approach To Construction</h2><p>We all know that electricity bills often take up more than 90% of mining expenditures. However, the seed for a successful Bitcoin mining operation site is planted with the first conduit in the ground, even before the machines start buzzing. </p><p>Developing a Bitcoin mining farm is a tedious job, requiring many moving pieces to come together. Usually, we are so focused on the bitcoin price and mining difficulty that not enough time is spent on the design, site planning and construction of a well-run facility. This fundamental job is usually outsourced to a consulting firm, an engineering firm or someone else. </p><p>But the negligence in hands-on planning of an operation during the construction and development stage can cost a fortune going forward. Even the most professional construction firm most likely has yet to gain experience in building a Bitcoin mining farm. It must be guided by Bitcoin nerds who know about common power supply problems like ASIC overheating issues, firmware upgrades, etc. </p><p>We’ve learned that a well-built Bitcoin facility reduces operational, cooling, maintenance and uptime expenses for years. On the other hand, a poorly-designed site can lead to rebuilding a plane in the air. The worst nightmare can be when everything is set, and you realize that something crucial is wrong. It could be that the voltage on a transformer is incorrect, or the cable is not sized correctly to operate 24/7, 365 with a nearly-95% load factor, just to name a few potential issues. </p><p>Learning about transformers, substations and airflow during development helps avoid future mistakes. This type of involvement is more crucial than constantly negotiating the price of mining equipment online. From a simple business perspective, the depreciation rate on a mining farm project is more than a decade, relatively small compared to that of mining equipment which is only a couple of years. That is why we let the mining infrastructure sit and wait for ASICs. </p><p>Bitcoin mining operations are marathons, not sprints. They require hard work behind the scenes before the hash rate shows up in the pool. Therefore, when the second crypto winter hit us, our key company players rolled up their sleeves and put their best feet forward to ensure the business operations were set up for success. </p><h2>Think Creatively About Energy Consumption</h2><h3>Gas Flaring Mitigation </h3><p>As power demands and electricity costs continue to rise, miners must integrate their power generation vertically. They must find new ways to generate revenue that do not only depend on hash price. </p><p>In 2018, when the bitcoin price started to fall, we were looking for alternative and affordable power to stay afloat. The obvious idea was that to get the most affordable power, one needs to generate electricity to eliminate intermediaries. We then realized that there was no way we could generate hydro, wind or solar power with a limited budget. </p><p>However, gas and electric generation has been around for decades and is relatively simple. What about natural gas? We would not have to buy propane tanks to mine Bitcoin. There was no need when <a href="https://www.texasobserver.org/report-oil-companies-are-burning-off-natural-gas-and-leaving-regulators-in-the-dark/">billions of cubic feet of natural gas are burned annually in oil fields</a>. While drilling for oil, natural gas is released from the same reservoir. Sadly, the gas is flared due to a lack of infrastructure or economic feasibility in capturing it. That’s when I first realized that Bitcoin mining could be a tool that supplements the inefficiencies of the energy industry. Since then, we started <a href="https://ezblockchain.net/smartgrid/">mining Bitcoin on natural gas</a>.</p><h3>Flexible Loads </h3><p>The energy sector is transitioning from a fossil-fuels-dominated era to one of renewable power. Specifically, wind and solar are intermittent, adding stress to the grid. Our solution to inconsistent supply has been mixing renewable energy with natural gas-peaking power plants. These power plants are flexible enough to fire up the turbines within a few minutes’ notice to respond to the undersupply. </p><p>Those operations that are heavily dependent on renewables power grids need to implement a demand-response program where the grid incentivizes the users to reduce the load. This has become a game changer in power grid operation. By lowering the peak demand for energy, demand response programs reduce the need to construct new, expensive peaking generation units. However, since the introduction of the <a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/oeprod/DocumentsandMedia/FERC_NAPDR_-_final.pdf">National Action Plan On Demand Response</a> in 2010, more progress has yet to be achieved.</p><p>A decade since, Bitcoin mining is the game changer. It is the most flexible, efficient, financially-feasible and, most importantly, working solution to grid instability. It can dispatch enormous loads of power in minutes without requiring any subsidies. It is market driven because Bitcoin miners always search for lower-cost operating facilities. Interestingly, the demand-response industry attracted a lot of attention once it started working correctly at scale. But the hero happened to be a long-hated “villain”: Bitcoin. </p><h2>The Future </h2><p>Energy companies have worked with Bitcoin miners long enough to understand that this industry is here to stay. It is a matter of time until the entire energy industry grows enough hard skin to accept it. Bitcoin mining has flipped from being just a power consumer to a consumer with benefits. The mining companies that will adopt different mining strategies, including optimizing operational costs, partnering with energy providers and finding a way to earn additional revenues using Bitcoin mining as a tool for energy management, will prevail. </p><p>This halving cycle ending in less than a year means that electricity sourcing and power prices will be even more crucial for the long-term success of the Bitcoin mining community. The next era of mining winners will be technologically-adapted companies with versatile toolkits to manage crises on many levels, including technological solutions for updating existing and developing new solutions. </p><p>Winters will come and go, Bitcoin will stay. The question is, who remains along with it?</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Sergii Gerasymovych.

The <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-102">SEC also accused</a> Coinbase of failing to register its crypto asset staking-as-a-service program. The complaint alleges that since 2019, Coinbase has facilitated the buying and selling of billions of dollars' worth of crypto asset securities without proper registration, combining the functions of an exchange, broker, and clearing agency.</p><p>The SEC claims that Coinbase's failure to register has deprived investors of essential protections such as SEC inspection, recordkeeping requirements, and safeguards against conflicts of interest. The charges also extend to Coinbase's holding company, Coinbase Global Inc., as it is considered a control person and thus liable for some of Coinbase's violations.</p><p>Additionally, the SEC alleges that Coinbase conducted an unregistered securities offering through its staking-as-a-service program. This program allows customers to earn profits through blockchain transaction validation services. Coinbase allegedly pooled customers' stakeable crypto assets, performed the necessary validations, and rewarded customers with a portion of the generated rewards. The SEC states that Coinbase failed to register these offers and sales as required by law.</p><p>Just yesterday, the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/sec-sues-cryptocurrency-exchange-binance-alleging-securities-laws-violations">SEC filed a lawsuit against Binance</a> and its CEO CZ, alleging that the exchange violated securities laws, brazenly dodged regulation by the SEC and did not properly inform their consumers. The combination of lawsuits within two days indicate a major effort by U.S. regulators to set a new tone for regulation and application of securities law to digital assets.</p><p>SEC Chair Gary Gensler <a href="https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1666059466750541825?s=20">criticized</a> Coinbase's alleged deprivation of critical protections for investors. Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, accused Coinbase of deliberately refusing to follow the federal securities laws, noting that the consequences for the investing public are significant.</p><p>Like the SEC's complaint against Binance, the regulator seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, penalties and other equitable relief. The investigation was conducted by the SEC's Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit, with the assistance of the San Francisco Regional Office and the multi-state task force of ten state securities regulators.</p><p>Coinbase has not yet responded publicly to the charges. The outcome of this case will have significant implications for the regulation of cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States and could be a major shift for the growth of the industry in the country. It's important to note that <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/06/28/secs-gensler-reiterates-bitcoin-alone-is-a-commodity-is-he-right/">SEC Chair Gary Gensler is on record</a> as differentiating Bitcoin from cryptocurrencies at large, saying that bitcoin alone is a commodity.

According to a press release shared with Bitcoin Magazine, LINER serves as a benchmark interest rate for bitcoin without credit risk, similar to the traditional finance's LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate). The index aims to provide an alternative to enterprises seeking exposure to bitcoin while avoiding the credit risk associated with CeFi yield platforms.</p><p>"By communicating real yield rates from bitcoin held on the LN, enterprises will recognize the strategic error in trusting CeFi yield platforms while capturing the benefits of payment network disruption that is decades overdue,” said Jesse Shrader, co-founder and CEO of Amboss. Nik Bhatia, creator of <a href="https://thebitcoinlayer.substack.com/">The Bitcoin Layer</a>, praised LINER as a first-of-its-kind reference rate derived from the Lightning Network, contributing to the establishment of unmanipulated money markets independent of a central authority.</p><p>Allen Farrington, a Bitcoin writer and investor, acknowledged the value of a reference rate like LINER for assessing the true cost of capital, highlighting the Lightning Network's growth as a self-sustaining financial ecosystem for both retail and enterprise needs.&nbsp;</p><p>Amboss also operates <a href="https://amboss.space/magma">Magma</a>, a marketplace facilitating the buying and selling of Lightning channels, enabling bitcoin holders to earn BTC from opening Lightning channels to various destinations. “Since Lightning channels are self-custodial ways to hold bitcoin, Magma enables novel bitcoin yield without custodial risk, avoiding the pitfalls of failed CeFi yield platforms like Celsius and BlockFi,” the press release stated.</p><p>LINER comprises two insightful metrics: LINER Cost and LINER Yield, which provide enterprises with valuable insights into the lightning market. These metrics allow for comparisons between LINER Cost and traditional payment card fees, empowering large bitcoin holders to make informed decisions regarding their bitcoin holdings.</p><p>Jonathan Bier, an author and investor, noted the potential future significance of the LINER index as a reference rate for Bitcoin-based investment decisions. The introduction of LINER opens up possibilities for portfolio managers, investors and businesses to leverage the index in their decision-making processes.</p><p>With LINER, Amboss aims to encourage enterprise adoption of the Lightning Network by demonstrating the cost savings and low-risk yield potential offered by Lightning-enabled payment infrastructure. The index provides a clear incentive for large bitcoin holders to utilize self-custodial strategies and earn higher returns while minimizing risk.

The penetration rate of digital payments among general consumers is also growing, as a McKinsey<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/banking-matters/consumer-trends-in-digital-payments"> survey</a> from 2022 found that nearly 90% of U.S. residents are using some form of digital payments.</p><p>And the Bitcoin market in particular is gaining greater attention, as the recent U.S. banking crisis and the negative outlook of the global economy <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/on-the-bitcoin-price-in-banking-crisis">serve to drive more individuals and businesses toward this sector</a>. Bitcoin is seen by many as a sound store of value, independent from governments and banks, providing an attractive alternative to traditional financial investments.</p><p>But can it realistically replace fiat currencies to become the money of the future?</p><h2>Bitcoin Attitudes: Progress To Date</h2><p>Ten years ago, only a small niche community was interested in BTC. Now, it is <a href="https://crypto.com/company-news/global-cryptocurrency-owners-grow-to-425-million-through-2022">estimated</a> that 425 million people across the world own cryptocurrency, following a 39% growth in digital asset holders in 2022.</p><p>Up until the last few years, it was the norm for many to deride Bitcoin and call it a fraud. But after 2020, a drastic change in attitudes has taken place, with BTC's perception evolving from a speculative investment to a legitimate store of value and medium of exchange.</p><p>The main reason behind this shift is the increasing institutional adoption of Bitcoin. Since 2020, institutional investors have entered the market en masse, fueling a major bull run and <a href="https://bitcointreasuries.net/">accumulating</a> more than 7.8% of the total BTC supply as of May 2023. Consequently, bitcoin has become a legitimate asset class that is taken more seriously by more people.</p><p>Moreover, a 2022 Deloitte survey <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/29/deloitte-75-percent-of-retailers-plan-to-accept-crypto-payments-in-2-years.html">revealed</a> that 75% of polled retailers are planning to accept cryptocurrency payments within the next two years.</p><p>Besides that, bitcoin has become legal tender in multiple jurisdictions including, most notably, El Salvador. </p><h2>Sustainable Bitcoin Mining Is Shifting The Narrative</h2><p>Due to the fact that they require significant computational power, Bitcoin mining operations are often associated with high energy consumption. And estimates that suggest these operations<a href="https://rmi.org/cryptocurrencys-energy-consumption-problem/"> consume enough power</a> to rival the annual electricity needs of some entire countries have resulted in Bitcoin facing harsh criticism in recent years, presenting a major barrier to mainstream adoption.</p><p>However, Bitcoin's inherent energy consumption can actually offer significant benefits by stabilizing electricity grids and reducing the cost of power for consumers by balancing supply and demand. </p><p>Monthly and yearly electricity consumption is spread unevenly throughout the day. Peak demand often occurs in the morning and evening hours, while at night and on weekends, it is significantly reduced. In many places, Bitcoin mining may consume only the spare electricity that is not used up by local residents, thus allowing power plants to operate at full capacity. Meanwhile, the average consumers are spared from greater expenses meant to cover the production of that “excess” electricity.</p><p>Moreover, the fierce competition among validators and Bitcoin's deflationary nature incentivize miners to find more efficient and sustainable ways to mine. As the mining process becomes more competitive, miners will likely continue investing in more advanced hardware and software to increase their chances of successfully mining new Bitcoin blocks. In addition, they will also take further steps to use renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, thus reducing mining’s environmental impact even more.</p><p>As a result, I expect the public perception of mining to become more positive in the next five years, and mining itself to become more sustainable as a business.</p><h2>Following the Salvadoran Example</h2><p>In recent years, there has been a growing trend toward accepting bitcoin as a legal payment method. Several countries have legalized using BTC for various purposes, such as buying goods and services or paying taxes.</p><p>In September 2021, El Salvador took this trend further by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/el-salvador-approves-first-law-bitcoin-legal-tender-2021-06-09/">becoming</a> the first country to make bitcoin a legal tender currency. Despite a somewhat troubled start, the nation's experiment has come with many positive results, especially if we <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/tourism-in-el-salvador-up-30-since-bitcoin-adoption-minister-says">consider</a> the Salvadoran GDP growth of over 10% in 2021 and the 30% increase in tourism since BTC’s adoption.</p><p>I believe more nations will follow El Salvador's footsteps to find an alternative solution to protect their economies against the current economic uncertainty. For example, similar plans to make BTC a legal tender have sprouted up in<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/mexican-senator-plans-to-introduce-bill-to-make-bitcoin-legal-tender"> Mexico</a>,<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/arizona-bitcoin-legal-tender-bill-introduced"> Arizona</a> and<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/lugano-switzerland-will-make-bitcoin-legal-tender"> Switzerland</a>. Meanwhile, Liechtenstein's upcoming legislation <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/liechtenstein-could-embrace-bitcoin-as-a-payment-method-for-gvmt-services-says-pm/">plans</a> to enable Bitcoin payments for government services.</p><p>However, while the legalization of Bitcoin as a payment method has many advantages, independent cryptocurrencies have always been seen as a threat to fiat. Crypto adoption increasing worldwide is surely the reason why many governments are committed to developing their own central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). These are essentially national currencies with state control over their issuance and payment networks.</p><p>Arguably, CBDCs stand a greater chance of gaining mainstream adoption than Bitcoin in the coming years. This is due to their potential for integration with existing financial systems and regulatory frameworks, as well as the backing and support of central banks around the world. However, both Bitcoin and CBDCs are still in the early stages of development, and their adoption will depend on a variety of factors.</p><h2>Is Bitcoin The Currency Of The Future?</h2><p>With a shift in consumer and business attitudes, growing use as a store of value and a medium of exchange, as well as positive developments in the mining industry and among national governments, Bitcoin is gradually progressing toward mainstream adoption.</p><p>As bitcoin use cases continue to expand, I believe more individuals and organizations will realize its potential as a long-term investment tool.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Didar Bekbauov.

The event witnessed notable participation from U.S. presidential candidates and generated enthusiasm, setting the stage for Bitcoin's mainstream adoption. Brandon Green, Head of Staff of Bitcoin Magazine, expressed his excitement, stating, "This year's Bitcoin Conference surpassed all my expectations, becoming a defining moment for the Bitcoin industry."</p><p>The conference also focused on fundraising efforts, with the organization <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/brink-million-dollar-bitcoin-donation-campaign">Brink successfully raising</a> $800,000 USD to support open-source Bitcoin protocol development. Samara Alpha Management and Bitcoin Magazine Pro announced a partnership for The Bitcoin Alpha Competition, offering a chance for startup managers and hedge funds to present their strategies to institutional allocators and potentially win $1 million in seed capital.</p><p>Art and commerce played a significant role at the conference. An art showcase and auction called <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/industry-events/miami-bitcoin-conference-will-have-ordinals-alley-art-gallery">Ordinal Alley</a> sold 6.38 BTC worth of rare pieces, highlighting the growing interest in Bitcoin and the Ordinals protocol within the art world. The Bitcoin Bazaar facilitated transactions using Bitcoin, while the Bitcoin Magazine store reported that 21% of all transactions were made using Lightning bitcoin payments.</p><p>Keynotes and sessions addressed various aspects of Bitcoin. U.S. Presidential candidates <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/robert-kennedy-jr-debuts-campaign-at-bitcoin-2023">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a> (Democratic party) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Bc2jRlBunQ">Vivek Ramaswamy</a> (Republican party) shared their visions for Bitcoin in their respective keynotes. Jack Mallers, CEO of Strike, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/strike-expands-globally-introduces-usdt-support-and-more-at-bitcoin-2023">announced the expansion</a> of the global money app to over 65 countries, offering fast and secure payments to a huge audience.</p><p>The conference fostered collaboration between industry leaders through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZnxsdWjG0&amp;feature=youtu.be">Industry Day</a>, which featured discussions on Bitcoin's impact on various sectors. A startup contest called <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/pitching-startup-ideas-at-bitcoin-2023">Pitch Day</a> also took place, with winners announced in two categories: infrastructure and adoption.</p><p>Beyond knowledge sharing, the conference emphasized community building. Bitcoin meetups from across the country competed in <a href="https://b.tc/conference/bitcoin-games">the Bitcoin games</a>, and a sold-out afterparty provided a platform for attendees to engage in meaningful conversations and form connections.</p><p>Finally, the organizers announced that the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/industry-events/worlds-largest-bitcoin-conference-will-take-place-in-nashville-for-2024">Bitcoin Conference 2024 will be held in Nashville, Tennessee</a>.

With the help of address tracking, public announcements and some estimation across data sources, we can get a sense of where nearly 47% of total bitcoin supply is today. A considerable portion of bitcoin’s 21-million supply is estimated to be lost, which includes Satoshi Nakamoto’s coins. There’s useful data from both <a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=BTC&amp;category=&amp;m=supply.ProvablyLost">Glassnode</a> and <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2017/11/25/lost-bitcoins/">Chainalysis</a> to suggest that nearly 4 million bitcoin has been lost.</p><p>Other large amounts of bitcoin are on exchanges, in the Grayscale trust, or in bitcoin miners’ wallets. Swaths of bitcoin have been accumulated by the likes of MicroStrategy, and more recently Tether. Some 5,500 bitcoin are locked up on the Lightning Network, while other sums exist as wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) on blockchains besides Bitcoin.</p><p>Most bitcoin estimates can be tracked on a routine basis when looking at examples, like known U.S. government-associated on-chain addresses from various bitcoin seizures, or when analyzing monthly production updates from public bitcoin miners, while other holding details can be much harder to come by. A private institution may have indicated bitcoin holdings years ago, but isn’t required to publicly announce updates of their stash. Other instances include uncertainty around government holdings. China may have <a href="https://twitter.com/ki_young_ju/status/1587917712126144512?s=20">194,000 bitcoin</a> from seizure, but it’s difficult to verify if this number is current.</p><p>All that said, the below chart is a rough cut of available data that can be expanded upon and improved for better accuracy across different groups. These figures come from on-chain forensics, public SEC filings and balance sheet attestations.&nbsp;</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk4NDU1ODc4MjcyMTY1NDIy/bitcoin-holdings-by-entity.png" height="310" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption>Bitcoin holdings separated by type of entity.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>Of the 2.3 million of bitcoin on exchanges, the majority resides on Binance and Coinbase. This wouldn’t include bitcoin in investment custody products like Grayscale and Coinbase Custody, for example. Binance’s share of bitcoin on exchanges has risen from under 10% in 2019 up to 30% today. The company is estimated to have nearly 700,000 bitcoin on their platform, which can predominantly be attributed to their derivatives marketplace dominance and their international presence, whereas Coinbase is mainly a spot exchange with a heavy U.S. presence.&nbsp;</p><figure>

        <figcaption>The percent share of exchanges' bitcoin balances.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>Over time, the amount of circulating bitcoin supply on exchanges has reached 17.5% of circulating supply, reaching its peak in March 2020 before declining to just 11.89%. We suspect that the trend of declining bitcoin on exchanges as a percentage of circulating supply will continue as bitcoin distributes across an increased number of global adopters, thanks to sophisticated personal custody solutions becoming more mainstream and robust as time goes on.&nbsp;</p><figure>

        <figcaption>A little less than 12% of circulating bitcoin is held on exchanges.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>In absolute terms, there has never been this level of long-term holders in bitcoin. In relative terms, the only two times in history with a larger share of long-term holder coins is in 2009 before bitcoin had an exchange rate, and in the depths of the 2015 bear market. With so much of the supply off the market, sell-side pressure in the interim can result in large price adjustments to the downside, since many market participants are partaking in more of a passive role.&nbsp;</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk4NDU1ODc4MjcyMjk2Nzg5/long-term-bitcoin-holders-supply.png" height="349" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption>Long-term holders' percentage of circulating supply is growing.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>We can also look at bitcoin’s illiquid supply to quantify holder dynamics. The term “illiquid supply” refers to bitcoin that are held by entities that rarely sell, meaning these coins are not readily available for trading. To quantify this, an entity's bitcoin holdings are deemed illiquid if less than 25% of its received bitcoins have been spent, liquid if 25% to 75% have been spent, and highly liquid if over 75% have been spent.</p><p>In the post-2016 halving era, bitcoin’s illiquid supply as a percentage of circulating supply is at its highest level, with holder accumulation taking coins off the market faster than miner issuance can distribute them. </p><p>As of this April 2023, bitcoin’s illiquid supply surpassed 15,000,000 coins.</p><figure>

        <figcaption>Illiquid bitcoin supply has trended upward since 2016.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>The trend is clear: Bitcoin continues to distribute into more hands, with a greater concentration of supply shifting from entities holding large amounts of bitcoin — balances of 1,000-10,000 BTC, 10,000-100,000 BTC, and greater than 100,000 BTC — to entities holding balances of 10 BTC or less.</p><figure>

        <figcaption>Bitcoin balances of less than 10 bitcoin has been growing for over a decade, meaning supply is getting distributed more evenly.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>It’s important to note that entities holding large amounts of bitcoin, particularly those with 10,000-plus BTC, are likely managing keys for thousands or even millions of users, exchanges being an obvious example. This is often a classic source of mischaracterization and misinformation when people make claims regarding a lack of wealth distribution of bitcoin. Yes, there are clumps of addresses with large holdings of bitcoin, but this is like claiming that one corporation owns 14% of all U.S. dollars in the commercial banking system. While JPMorgan Chase has $2.4 trillion out of $17.1 trillion of deposits in domestic banks and the deposits are a liability of JPMorgan, in actuality, they are custodied for millions of unique individuals and businesses. </p><p>The key difference — aside from the legal versus cryptographic ownership structure — is the fact that bitcoin’s ownership structure, the UTXO set, is much more transparent and easily auditable. This makes it easy for anyone to look at the data and make informed claims about bitcoin’s supply concentration. </p><h2>Final Note</h2><p>Bitcoin has been successful in attracting a broad spectrum of holders, from individuals to corporations, private entities and even nation-states. As evidenced by increasing retail ownership and historically high levels of long-term holders, it’s clear that bitcoin's supply is getting distributed more evenly across this vast array of adopters. This trend is further reinforced by a declining amount of bitcoin held on exchanges and an increasing illiquid supply.</p><p>Moving forward, we anticipate these trends of increased distribution and declining concentration to continue, as bitcoin’s 21,000,000 hard capped supply is divided up between the world’s individuals, institutions, corporations and nation states. </p><hr><p><em>That concludes the excerpt from a recent edition of Bitcoin Magazine PRO. </em><a href="https://bmpro.substack.com/subscribe"><em>Subscribe now</em></a><em> to receive PRO articles directly in your inbox.</em></p><figure>

Per the complaint, Binance engaged in unregistered offers and sales of securities and made false representations to investors regarding surveillance and controls over manipulative trading.</p><p>According to the SEC’s claim, Binance and its subsidiary, BAM Trading, operated as an exchange, broker-dealer and clearing agency without registering with the SEC. The commission also alleges that Binance conducted unregistered offers and sales of its own cryptocurrency assets, as well as profit-generating programs and investment schemes. Specifically, the charges focus on the BNB and BUSD cryptocurrencies launched by Binance, as well as the BNB Vault and Simple Earn programs, “and a so-called ‘staking’ investment scheme available on the Binance.US Platform.” The defendants are accused of depriving investors of material information about these securities and programs.</p><p>Furthermore, the complaint states that Binance and BAM Trading made misrepresentations about the controls implemented on the Binance.US platform, raising significant amounts of money from private investors. The SEC asserts that Binance evaded U.S. laws and regulation by implementing a plan to surreptitiously escape registration requirements. “As Zhao himself acknowledged—Binance did not want to ‘be held accountable’ for these actions,” the filed charges explain. “As the Binance CCO explained, ‘[o]n the surface we cannot be seen to have US users[,] but in reality, we should get them through other creative means.’”</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/sec-complaint-aims-to-unilaterally-define-crypto-market-structure-8707489117122437402">response</a> to the SEC's complaint, Binance expressed disappointment and emphasized its active cooperation with the SEC's investigations.

According to a press release shared with Bitcoin Magazine, the platform aims to tap into the vast pool of merchants in the country, ranging from mom-and-pop stores to boutique hotels.</p><p>Pouch.ph utilizes the Lightning Network built on top of Bitcoin to facilitate faster, more affordable and user-friendly digital payments. With this payment protocol, customers can pay by scanning a merchant's QR code with any Bitcoin wallet, and Pouch.ph converts the bitcoin to pesos, transferring the funds directly to the merchant's bank or mobile money account.</p><p>According to Ethan Rose, CEO of Pouch.ph, one of the significant challenges faced by small businesses is the limited availability of payment methods, with credit cards charging fees of up to three percent. With the increasing number of internet and smartphone users in the Philippines, accepting bitcoin as a payment method opens up opportunities for those without credit cards or local fiat currency to make online or in-store purchases.</p><p>Some local businesses in Boracay, a popular tourist destination, have already embraced bitcoin payments through Pouch.ph. In the press release, Erielyn Gaston, owner of Kasbar restaurant, highlighted the advantages of accepting Bitcoin, stating that it has allowed her to attract a wider customer base and increase sales. Meanwhile, TIB Market manager Marcel Selfer praised the convenience of a fast and easily available payment service, noting that it provides an alternative to high fees charged by non-bank ATMs for credit card users.</p><p>Expanding its services beyond Boracay, Pouch.ph noted that it has successfully onboarded merchants in cities such as Cebu City, Dumaguete, Iloilo and Bacolod City. Additionally, in Metro Manila, establishments like URBN QC, Draper Startup House and KosneyLand have started accepting bitcoin payments through Pouch.ph. The company also offers a Batch Pay feature, enabling business owners to send payments instantly to employees, suppliers and other recipients, simplifying payment processes.</p><p>To facilitate bitcoin transactions, individuals can utilize <a href="http://btcmap.org/">BTCMap.org</a> to locate merchants that accept Bitcoin payments. Pouch.ph plans to extend its Batch Pay services for over-the-counter remittances through LBC, M Lhuillier and Palawan Pawnshop. By embracing bitcoin, small businesses in the Philippines are capitalizing on the increasing number of internet and smartphone users, while offering customers more diverse and convenient payment options.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzMDI2MTUyOTY3NzA5OTE3/global-hyperbitcoinization.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[El Salvador Unleashes "Volcano Energy" With 241 Megawatt Planned Bitcoin Mining Operation]]></title><description><![CDATA[The country of El Salvador is harnessing its energy resources and constructing a renewable power generation park to fuel the growth of Bitcoin mining.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/el-salvador-bitcoin-news/el-salvador-plans-241-megawatt-renewable-plant-for-bitcoin-mining</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/el-salvador-bitcoin-news/el-salvador-plans-241-megawatt-renewable-plant-for-bitcoin-mining</guid><category><![CDATA[Mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[el salvador]]></category><category><![CDATA[Renewable Energy]]></category><category><![CDATA[El Salvador]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Solar]]></category><category><![CDATA[Power Plant]]></category><category><![CDATA[wind]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jun 2023 13:32:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg0MDA2MjQxMTQ2NjQ0MTY5/volcano.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>The country of El Salvador is tapping into its abundant natural resources to create “<a href="https://twitter.com/Volcano_Energy">Volcano Energy</a>.” According to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, the aim is to position the country as a major global player in the Bitcoin mining industry while promoting energy competitiveness, diversification and geographic expansion for the Bitcoin network. Adopting a debt-free approach, El Salvador plans to construct a 241 megawatt (MW) renewable power generation park in the Metapán region, combining solar and wind projects.</p><p>"This project is a transformative journey that will establish one of the world's largest Bitcoin mining farms," the release said. “Located in the El Shiste hamlet, within the municipality of Metapán, Santa Ana, this chosen site boasts exceptional solar and wind energy yields in the country.” The park will have a capacity of 169MW of photovoltaic solar energy and 72MW of wind energy. The initial computational power is expected to surpass 1.3 EH/s, marking a significant milestone for the country and industry.</p><p>The release stated that “The total commitment for the project is $1 billion, beginning with a first investment of $250 million, bootstrapped by key Bitcoin industry leaders, with collaboration from top developers and manufacturers of renewable energy technology, as well as Bitcoin mining experts on a global scale.” The government of El Salvador will play a crucial role in the planning and execution of the initiative, securing a preferred participation equivalent to 23% of the revenue. The remaining ownership will be divided among investors and reinvested in expanding energy production capacity and advancing Bitcoin mining.</p><p>Robert Warren of Distributed Hash <a href="https://twitter.com/BikesandBitcoin/status/1665719174549626880?s=20">explained on Twitter</a> that the reasoning behind leveraging wind and solar is likely to monetize quicker to build upon a base set of geothermal expansion.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/BikesandBitcoin/status/1665719174549626880"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>By leveraging Volcano Energy, El Salvador aims to create a prosperous future driven by sustainable energy and Bitcoin. As the country’s investment progresses volcanoes could serve as the backbone of this transformation, fostering economic growth and prosperity for future generations. The establishment of the renewable power generation park signifies a large step towards achieving these goals while cementing El Salvador's position in the global Bitcoin mining industry.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg0MDA2MjQxMTQ2NjQ0MTY5/volcano.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[We’ve Failed Gen Z, But Bitcoin Offers Hope For The Future]]></title><description><![CDATA[The members of Generation Z have had their futures stolen by monetary mismanagement, but they are poised to rebuild with Bitcoin.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/how-bitcoin-might-save-gen-z</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/how-bitcoin-might-save-gen-z</guid><category><![CDATA[Zoomers]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[sound money]]></category><category><![CDATA[debt]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[David Waugh,Dave Birnbaum]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jun 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwNTQxOTQxNDY3Nzg0MzE2/silver-or-orange-lining-in-the-clouds-hope-freedom-storm.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by David Waugh, business development and communications specialist at bitcoin investing platform Coinbits, and Dave Birnbaum, the product director at Coinbits.</em></p><p>Every generation has bones to pick with those who came before. However, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z">Generation Z</a>, those born between the late 1990s and early 2010s, have an especially valid complaint: Previous generations have stolen their future.</p><p>Also called “the Zoomers,” this group was forced by lockdowns and school closures to socialize through webcams during their formative years. These <a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/gen-z-stats">68 million Americans</a> have had their lives disrupted by social upheaval, wealth destruction and cultural decline, all during the prime of their youth.</p><p>Many Zoomers do not yet realize the scale of the crime perpetrated against them. Some are waking up. Either way, all of them will soon need to chip in to pay the piper for decades of monetary and fiscal mismanagement by prior generations.</p><p>But the situation is not hopeless. There is a tool that Generation Z can use to achieve restitution. Instead of embarking on a dismal project to rebuild our ruined financial system, only to reinstate the rents and inequities that existed before, Zoomers can leave their mark upon history by using bitcoin to build a new system that is resilient, equitable and just. </p><p>Like the Greatest Generation, which rebuilt America on strong foundations after facing down the greatest threat to humanity that had ever manifested, Generation Z can channel their well-earned sense of betrayal and loss to create a world order worthy of being passed down to their own children and grandchildren.</p><h2>Backed Into A Corner</h2><p>Sometimes called “<a href="https://brownstone.org/articles/the-loneliest-generation/">the loneliest generation</a>,” Gen Z has been sold out by their elders, who have declined to make the necessary sacrifices to allow future generations to prosper. The psychological warfare waged against Zoomers is sometimes subtle, but often, it is not. In schools, mass media and online, they are assailed with doom about climate, race and exploitation, and told that their future has been stolen by evil people who selfishly refuse to fix those problems. </p><p>In fact, this is a half truth. The Zoomers' future has indeed been stolen, but not by polluters and racists. Instead, globalist elites, smart enough to see their system failing but not courageous enough to take responsibility for it, have looted the financial and cultural capital left to us by the Greatest Generation.</p><p>As part of the coverup for this crime, Zoomers have endured a constant onslaught of depressing propaganda. They are told the <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/426353-ocasio-cortez-the-world-will-end-in-12-years-if-we-dont-address/">world will end</a> in 10 years. <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/is-climate-change-keeping-you-up-at-night-you-may-have-climate-anxiety-202206132761">"Climate anxiety" is widespread</a> among a generation that is instructed to feel guilty for their existence rather than called to create new things and solve problems. Previous generations shot for the moon. <a href="https://time.com/6273065/space-travel-climate-impact/">Today’s elites disparage space exploration</a> out of concern that rockets might affect the weather.</p><p>All of this has yielded predictable results. Zoomers experience high rates of suicide, depression, anxiety and many <a href="https://brownstone.org/articles/the-loneliest-generation/">feel that life is meaningless.</a></p><p>Politicians are not likely to offer a solution. Appealing to the voting base of Generation Z is a shameful game of <a href="https://www.aier.org/article/the-gaslighting-of-the-american-people/">gaslighting</a>, <a href="https://www.aier.org/article/welcome-to-the-frankfurtian-world/">virtue signaling</a> and self-righteous <a href="https://mises.org/library/strange-liberty-politics-drops-its-pretenses">power grabs</a>. Political leaders <a href="https://www.aier.org/article/the-biden-budget-smoke-mirrors-and-class-warfare/">deny reality</a>, and claim that they can <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/10/13/remarks-on-executing-a-modern-american-industrial-strategy-by-nec-director-brian-deese/">engineer prosperity</a> using central planning. Government schools and universities generally fail to deliver a quality humanist education, depriving an entire generation of the necessary intellectual tools to notice this deception.</p><h2>Growing Awareness Of The Problem</h2><p>And yet, many members of Generation Z are coming to important realizations as they work their way through the rubble of the university system and join the workforce. We recently caught up with Jack Nicastro, a current Dartmouth College student, who believes he can see through politically motivated pessimism:</p><p>“Mainstream culture is hopelessly (and insupportably) pessimistic, particularly apropos technology,” Nicastro said. “Politicians capitalize on the populace's anxieties about technology, automation and AI with their usual demagoguery to advance illiberal policy agenda, as evidenced by the TikTok hearings.”</p><p>Sid Gundapaneni, a student at Binghamton University, offered a similar perspective, stating he is, “optimistic in a broad sense” regarding living standards, though less certain about the future of freedom:</p><p>“From a liberty standpoint, I'm unable to maintain such confidence — and I believe there are long-term consequences for this,” he said. “But right now, governments and their subsidized industries show no fatigue in their massive growth.”</p><h2>Coming To Terms With The Challenge</h2><p>The fiscal and monetary crises facing Gen Z are significant. The national debt is <a href="https://www.usdebtclock.org/#">over $31 trillion</a>, and unfunded liabilities exceed $187 trillion. Thanks to a politicized and incompetent Federal Reserve, the American economy is <a href="https://www.aier.org/article/the-path-to-full-stagflation/">headed toward stagflation</a>, a nasty phenomenon where inflation and unemployment intensify at the same time.</p><p>Leaders from major political parties <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/3953384-cassidy-says-biden-and-trump-have-same-plan-on-social-security-which-is-to-do-nothing/">claim</a> Social Security and Medicare reforms are off the table. Brian Riedl, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2023/04/social-security-and-medicare-insolvency-dates-are-a-distraction/">recently stated</a> that both programs “will drive $116 trillion in budget deficits over the next 30 years, according to CBO (Congressional Budget Office) data.”</p><p>Some Zoomers recognize the need for reform. In a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/will-gen-z-cash-in-on-social-security-reform-insolvency-retirement-savings-accounts-college-university-student-rick-scott-political-capital-e626edd1">Wall Street Journal article</a> featuring student commentary on Social Security, Mark Panjaitan, an undergraduate at the University of Texas at Austin, stated, “Instead of placing retirement dreams in the hands of a deadlocked Congress, I advise everyone to depend on the fruits of their own labor.”</p><p>Another, Ryan Callahan of the University of Virginia, claimed, “Regardless of the changes Congress makes, Social Security will be a ghost of its former self by the time my generation can collect.”</p><p>With the political process unable to address basic needs for change, let alone ambitious projects that require sacrifice for the sake of future generations, voting and activism cannot solve this problem alone. On our current trajectory, the amount of economic growth that would be needed to pay off our debt is almost mathematically impossible — barring a technology breakthrough that rearranges the chess board.</p><h2>A Generation Primed For Bitcoin</h2><p>A defining characteristic of Zoomers that makes them worthy of their name is that they move incredibly fast. Gen Z was brought up on a media diet of frenetic stimulation. Its members are quick to learn new technologies and good at using them to create novel content, apps and social experiences. </p><p>As McKinsey researchers <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/true-gen-generation-z-and-its-implications-for-companies">noted</a>, “Members of Gen Z… are true digital natives: from earliest youth, they have been exposed to the internet, to social networks, and to mobile systems.” </p><p>This fast-paced, technology-centric way of life primes the Zoomers for Bitcoin. While previous generations might balk at Bitcoin’s unfamiliarity, Zoomers are <em>more</em> comfortable with Bitcoin than they are with traditional banks and financial products. They are well positioned to build out the necessary infrastructure to bring Bitcoin to billions of people — and change the calculus confronting the problems of their time.</p><h2>The Journey Home</h2><p>Although Bitcoin offers hope for Zoomers, they must steel themselves for what is to come — a difficult journey to return to a balanced and free society. Preparing will require independent study, to make up for the miseducation prevalent in government schools and higher education. They will need to organize their own communities using encrypted communication networks in the face of censorship, intimidation and surveillance. They must permeate existing institutions, such as the legal and financial fields, public service and corporate leadership, with the means to impose tough reforms.</p><p>In addition, they will need to understand that Bitcoin provides a key part of these means. Bitcoin is leverage in a world where Gen Z has very little. They’ll need to reject the false promise of “crypto,” and relearn the ancient art of long-term thinking.</p><p>Every generation deals with crises, but some generations are called to especially tough challenges. The Greatest Generation went to war to protect humanity from totalitarian regimes. The Zoomers now must face the repercussions of decades of monetary and fiscal irresponsibility, and the downstream destruction it has wrought on their freedoms and their culture. </p><p>They did not ask for it, but for a generation of young people who struggle to believe that their lives have meaning, the calling to rebuild with Bitcoin is perhaps the greatest blessing they could have received. It won’t be easy, but it will be worth it.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by David Waugh and Dave Birnbaum.

But, much to their chagrin, their victory lap ended up being premature. Bitcoin has come roaring back in 2023, ending these premature celebrations and taking back some of its 2022 losses with a massive <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">year-to-date gain of over 60%</a> as of this writing so far in 2023. </p><p>Here are three reasons behind Bitcoin’s 2023 resurgence: </p><h2>One: Banking Sector Turmoil And A Timely Reminder Of Bitcoin’s Value </h2><p>In March 2023, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/recap-of-last-weeks-banking-contagion-and-bitcoin">turmoil from the banking sector</a> in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse rocked the market with the types of issues that it hadn’t experienced since the Great Recession. This was no fly-by-night operation; at the time, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) was the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/03/13/1163155347/svb-silicon-valley-bank-collapse-bailout-failure#:~:text=via%20Getty%20Images-,Silicon%20Valley%20Bank%20was%20the%2016th%20largest%20bank%20in%20America,group%20texts%20and%20Twitter%20posts.">sixteenth-largest bank in the United States</a> and the bank of choice for many venture capitalists and startups.</p><p>This high-profile implosion and the lack of proper risk management in place at SVB led many individuals to question how safe their money was. Ultimately, the Federal Reserve <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/2023/03/22/what-did-the-fed-do-after-silicon-valley-bank-and-signature-bank-failed/">stepped in to make the bank’s depositors whole</a>, but the event still called the health of the banking system into question. </p><p>While not everyone is rushing to take their money out of banks, many more people are now at least aware of the risks of a single point of failure and are moving to diversify their assets by splitting them between multiple banks or even diversifying into alternatives like bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for the first time. </p><p>The appeal of a fully decentralized asset like bitcoin is that there is no CEO or management team in charge that can endanger the solvency of the Bitcoin network by making a bad decision or poor judgment call. Bitcoin users don’t have to trust a company or management team to use Bitcoin; they can instead verify the open-source code that governs the Bitcoin network. Anyone can view any transaction ever made on the Bitcoin blockchain, giving the network unmatched transparency.</p><p>The price of bitcoin surged in March in the wake of the crisis, and in late April, renewed troubles at First Republic Bank, which reported that it <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3959401-first-republic-stock-slides-7-after-deposits-sank-by-more-than-70b-in-q1?hasComeFromMpArticle=false">lost over $70 billion in deposits during the previous quarter</a> propelled bitcoin prices higher yet again, showing that investors and savers clearly view it as a port in the storm amidst the current uncertainty. </p><h2>Two: Dedollarization At A Global Scale</h2><p>In addition to the specific troubles highlighted by the banking crisis, faith in the dollar itself seems to be dwindling globally. Bitcoin isn’t the only indicator here; precious metals like <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/why-gold-and-silver-prices-surged-today-51667953747">gold and silver are surging</a> while USD reserve currency held by other countries is at its lowest level in decades: from 73% in 2001 to 55% 20 later, in 2021, and down to 47% by April 2022, <a href="https://www.kitco.com/news/2023-04-19/USD-is-suffering-stunning-collapse-as-world-s-reserve-currency-warns-Eurizon-SLJ-Capital-s-Jen.html">according to economist Stephen Jen</a>. The yuan is now the <a href="https://www.kitco.com/news/2023-04-19/USD-is-suffering-stunning-collapse-as-world-s-reserve-currency-warns-Eurizon-SLJ-Capital-s-Jen.html">most-traded currency in Russia</a> while China and Brazil recently struck an agreement to settle trades in the yuan and real instead of in dollars. Meanwhile, Malaysia is making similar deals with both India and China. </p><p>Former Goldman Sachs Chief Economist Jim O’Neill — <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2021/06/jim-oneill-revisits-brics-emerging-markets.htm">who originated the BRICS acronym</a>, referring to then-emerging economies Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa — recently called on these countries to <a href="https://www.kitco.com/news/2023-03-30/Ex-Goldman-chief-economist-calls-on-BRICS-to-challenge-USD-s-dominance-as-China-leads-de-dollarization-trend.html">challenge dollar hegemony</a> with a new native currency. This ambition is likely a bridge too far at this point in time. As a commodity importer, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/02d6ab99-ea36-41c4-9ad3-9658bb1894a7">China’s economic goals</a> aren’t aligned with commodity exporters like Brazil and Russia. Furthermore, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-53062484">tensions between China and India</a> call the likelihood of this coming together into question. Nevertheless, it is another signpost on the road towards global dedollarization. It’s not just BRICs countries that are exploring their options — U.S. allies like French president Emmanuel Macron recently warned that Europe should <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/french-president-emmanuel-macron-states-europe-must-reduce-its-dependence-on-the-us-dollar-to-avoid-becoming-vassals/">reduce its dependence on the U.S. dollar</a> to avoid becoming “vassals.” </p><p>While none of this means that the end of the dollar’s reign as the global reserve currency is guaranteed or imminent, it does paint the picture that individuals and nations are clearly looking for non-dollar alternatives to diversify into. </p><p>The long-term effects of dedollarization and the banking crisis’ effect on Bitcoin is still being written, but it has made more people aware of Bitcoin as a viable alternative to the current system, and it has certainly served as a catalyst for the price of bitcoin. In the immediate aftermath of the crisis, bitcoin climbed from <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">just under $20,000 on March 10, 2023 to over $30,000 barely a month later on April 13, 2023,</a> gaining 50% and adding $200 billion to its market capitalization in the process. </p><h2>Three: Development Of The Layer 2 Ecosystem</h2><p>Along with <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/ordinal-concerns-bitcoin-decentralization-and-block-space">the rise of Ordinals</a>, Bitcoin has benefitted from the further development of its Layer 2 ecosystem, through projects such as Stacks and the Lightning Network. Stacks is a “<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/27/allure-of-bitcoin-ordinals-defi-drives-crypto-funds-to-bitcoin-layer-2-token-stacks/">Layer 2 companion chain for smart contracts</a> focused on bitcoin (BTC) … allowing for the creation of related financial products.” At the time of this writing, Stacks <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/stacks/">has a market value of nearly $1 billion</a> and is approaching the top-50 cryptocurrencies in market capitalizaiton. </p><p>Recent upgrades to Stacks enable Stacks users to pledge their tokens to secure the network to earn rewards in a manner similar to how networks like Ethereum enable participants to earn rewards by staking their holdings. In this way, Stacks could ultimately end up bringing DeFi to Bitcoin. </p><p>In addition to Stacks, other Bitcoin Layer 2 protocols like Lightning continue to grow. Lightning is focused on making Bitcoin more scalable. Recent research from Glassnode found that Lightning is <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-lightning-network-is-1-000x-cheaper-than-visa-and-mastercard-data">1,000-times cheaper than using legacy payment processors</a> like Visa and Mastercard. Glassnode’s James Check found that the fee for sending 1 BTC across the Lightning Network was 3,000 satoshis (the smallest unit of bitcoin), which was the equivalent of an $0.84 fee to send $28,000 in dollar terms, or a miniscule fee of just 0.0029%.

History may not repeat itself per se, but as an endless record of follower-humans following leader-humans off of proverbial cliffs demonstrates (and for no other reason than the leader-humans were/are really skilled at lying), it certainly feels like déjà vu all over again. </p><p>Worry not! This is not an article about Trump or about ideological disaffection. Trump is just one man in a human melodrama that spans millennia. The focus of this piece is about the role Bitcoin can play in restoring belief and in ending human somnambulance; it is about how we disempower the disinformationalists. And it is a warning, for those in power will go to any lengths to maintain their hypnotic grip on humanity. </p><h2>Why Governments Fear Bitcoin</h2><p>So, the first question we must examine is this: Why are governments seemingly so afraid of Bitcoin? Interestingly, it’s not simply because Bitcoin has the potential to end governments’ monopoly on money (which is admittedly a pretty big deal in and of itself). No. The underlying reason actually indicates something far more fundamental: Governments are afraid of Bitcoin as a construct because governments can only govern through deceit and dishonesty. </p><p>You see, the most powerful and successful governments throughout history have been (and remain) the ones that are the most adroit and accomplished at lying. The United States government, that bastion of supposed democratic righteousness, is in fact a compelling example of this principle. From Vietnam to Iraq, Joseph McCarthy to Lyndon Johnson to Jerome Powell and beyond, U.S. history is replete with examples of the power of lies, and of the malleability of the minds of well-intentioned, patriotic, innocent, hopeful, lost citizens.</p><h2>Bitcoin Outs The Lies</h2><p>Back to Trump for a moment. This from the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37673797">BBC</a>: </p><p>“Mr. Trump has questioned the legitimacy of the election process in a series of tweets, the latest of which said on Monday: ‘Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day… Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on? So naive!’ “ </p><p>The above quote is <em>not</em> from the fall of 2020. This is from 2016, when then-candidate Trump was facing then-candidate Hilary Clinton in the general election. Lest we forget, Trump has been making claims of rigged elections for years. A masterful and, in fact, quite sophisticated practitioner in the art of exploiting human neurological frailty, Trump brilliantly leveraged (and <em>continues</em> to leverage) his skills as a purveyor of disinformation. Indeed, tens of millions of Americans <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/40-americans-think-2020-election-stolen-days-before-midterms-1756218">continue to believe</a> that Trump’s claims of election fraud in 2020 are correct, and that the presidency was stolen from him and from his followers. </p><p>I find this entirely fascinating and frightening at the same time.</p><p>The point is not whether Trump’s claims are accurate. And, if I am being honest, I must admit to having no way of knowing whether or not Trump’s claims are true. (The fact is, if I reject his claims, I may simply be choosing to believe the narrative that has been proffered by the other side. Both sides adhere tenaciously to their data. Both sides dwell in echo chambers that reinforce their narratives. Both sides suffer from the anti-intellectual effects caused by the frailties of human neuroplasticity. And both sides are composed of millions of follower-humans, unaware of the power that the leader-humans wield through their manipulations, through their theater, through their deceits.) </p><p>The point here is that, without the capacity to verify Trump’s claims, we are all potential prey; without the ability to know beyond any doubt what really happened in the last election cycle, there is no way to trust the election results — indeed, there is no way to trust our political process at all. </p><h2>Bitcoin And Neuroplasticity</h2><p>Neuroscience 101: Hear something enough and you will believe it to be true. Get on your knees and pray to God every day for an hour, and within months, perhaps weeks, even dyed-in-the-wool atheists will believe in God. Read only articles on Breitbart and The Gateway Pundit, listen only to podcasts by Tucker Carlson and Glenn Beck, and you will, beyond any doubt in your mind, believe the election was stolen. Read only articles on Mother Jones and HuffPost and Slate Magazine, and you will believe beyond any doubt in your mind that the election was valid. Listen only to YouTube channels broadcasting the views of Michael Saylor, Balaji Srinivasan, Mark Moss and Jeff Booth and you will believe that bitcoin to $1 million dollars is inevitable, that hyperinflation is coming and that the banks are all going to collapse. Listen only to YouTube channels touting the views of Warren Buffet and Peter Schiff and you will believe Bitcoin is a ponzi scheme and a scam. </p><p>Humans are sheep because we are wired to be sheep. We believe that we are critical thinkers and great discerners of truth, but we are all of us just ingesting and internalizing the narratives that we hear, over and over and over again.</p><p>Without verification, we are all potential victims to the lies told by those in power. </p><p>Again, enter Bitcoin.</p><p>As I posited in <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/as-trust-erodes-bitcoin-is-verifiable">my previous article</a>, we need to have some imagination. We need to have the willingness to see that, in time, the Bitcoin network could act as the foundational layer to all digital interactions. And in time, there is every possibility that such a network could have the capacity to verify beyond any possible doubt each transaction, each interaction, each news story, each claim by the government, each tweet, etc. </p><p>But here’s the thing: We actually do <em>not</em> need to have much imagination at all to recognize that elections and blockchain technology are present tense, not future tense, considerations.</p><p>Imagine a system in which every ballot is imprinted with a digital private key/signature. All voting records live on an immutable ledger. While this will not disempower those who employ lies and disinformation as a way to manipulate the neurologically susceptible, it will move us in a direction in which claims of voter fraud, like those touted by Trump, have no teeth. And perhaps in time, as Bitcoin and the Bitcoin network proliferates, more such forms of verification have the potential to undercut the liars’ superpower.</p><p>I recognize that at <em>this</em> moment, Bitcoin is feared more for its ability to circumvent monetary control than it is for its inherently truthful nature. U.S. leaders are frightened at the prospect of the dollar losing its status as the world’s reserve currency, and as such, they will do pretty much anything to question and undermine the legitimacy and accessibility of anything that furthers such a possibility. (For example, right now we hear far more about the evils of China and of RNB ascendancy than we do about Bitcoin.) </p><p>But <em>can you see, in a possible future in which lying becomes increasingly difficult, why our leaders might fear Bitcoin so very much? And can you see why our leaders will do anything to stop the ascendency of truth and verification? </em>I have little doubt that, as the Bitcoin network becomes increasingly capable of vetting any and all forms of data, of verifying any and all forms and claims upon truth, that leaders the world over will do everything — <em>everything!</em> — in their power to destroy this network — because without the ability to lie, to manipulate we the sheep, all governments, all centralized power brokers, must by their very nature fail.</p><p>In time, Bitcoin can become so much more than a monetary network. It can become so much more than a store of monetary value. It can become so much more than property. In time, The Bitcoin protocol and Bitcoin network can become the very thing that those in power fear most: <em>the truth</em>. </p><p>Where there is truth, the sheep awaken.</p><h2>The Trumps Of The World Must Be Held To Account</h2><p>As I said at the beginning of this piece, this is not a political screed. Politicians lie, regardless of ideology. Leaders on the left are just as apt, just as skilled, at employing disinformation and dishonesty as are those on the right. The point is, without the ability to objectively verify the truth, humans will continue to hurl their mindless selves into the fray, believing to their core the lies proffered by those who benefit from such duplicity. </p><p>I know that many of you reading this will see my views about the evolution of the Bitcoin network as the stuff of fantasy. I ask you though: Throughout human history, hasn’t every advancement at once been thought of as fantastic? Bitcoin is only just beginning. Once our leaders come to realize that, in the not-so-distant future, the Bitcoin network and protocol could morph into a global and inviolable lie detector, they will go to any length to kill it. For they are only as powerful as are the believability of the lies they tell.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Dan Weintraub.

Bitcoin mined during the month increased by 16% to 609 BTC.&nbsp;</p><p>CleanSpark's CEO, Zach Bradford, expressed satisfaction with the company's performance, stating, "Not only do we continue to increase the amount of bitcoin in our treasury, but we also surpassed $100 million in revenue for our fiscal year to date."</p><p>Bradford also attributed the higher-than-expected bitcoin production to increased operational efficiency and a temporary surge in transaction fees due to increased interest in Ordinals on the blockchain.

Larson shared his personal journey with digital assets, starting in 2016, and his realization of the need for accessible resources and education for individuals interested in Bitcoin. He joined the credit union in 2021 and focused on education and connecting people with resources related to cryptocurrency.</p><p>Meyer emphasized the importance of understanding the material need for Bitcoin services in their community and outlined a strategic four-step approach that prioritizes education and storage, then transactional ability and banking products. Meyer highlighted their focus on education as a way to change the narrative around Bitcoin and address the risks and concerns associated with it.</p><p>Regarding the bitcoin custody solution, Larson stated that they have been working on developing a product that is currently operational but not yet ready for launch to their 25,000 members. The credit union has been prioritizing education both internally and externally, ensuring that their employees and members understand the intricacies and risks of cryptocurrencies. They aim to be a reliable partner for their members, offering safe storage options and guidance without advising specific investments.</p><p>“From an educational perspective, we said, let's really start foundational from the ground floor,” Larson explained. “We're going to walk our members through this high level of education, in an effort to, one, help them become more informed, regardless if they own it today, plan to own it or not, we want our members to be well informed. And then two for those that choose to get into the space, hopefully, they make more informed decisions and understand the risks.” </p><p>The interview also touched on their collaborative approach with regulators to ensure responsible implementation of their Bitcoin services. Larson and Meyer believe that education and storage are areas where they can make a significant impact while working within regulatory frameworks. They have engaged with regulators and are in ongoing discussions to incorporate their feedback into the development of policies and procedures.</p><p>Speaking on the future impact that Bitcoin could have on the traditional finance realm, Meyer said that “If you do nothing, I think you're taking more risk as to where this industry is actually headed in the future, and how it will actually impact us to a significant degree. And if you don't want to be on the receiving end of how others have developed this, you should probably get involved now.” </p><p>Overall, St. Cloud Financial Credit Union's approach to Bitcoin reflects a commitment to educating their members and working collaboratively with regulators to navigate the evolving landscape of Bitcoin. While <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/self-custody">self-custody</a> is inherently the most safe method of storing bitcoin, in a world where education on Bitcoin is lacking credit unions can serve in an educational role. In addition, innovations like <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/fediment-evolution-of-bitcoin-custody">Fedimints</a> could help create custodial solutions that help retain the properties of Bitcoin that make it sovereign money, while still ensuring a level of distributed responsibility that makes those involved more comfortable.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwMTczNDY5NTEyNTc0NjIy/bitcoin-blockchain.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Breaking Barriers: How Bitcoin Can Transform The Real Estate Industry]]></title><description><![CDATA[By eliminating middlemen and giving buyers a better form of money, Bitcoin can bring distinct advantages to the real estate industry.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-makes-real-estate-transactions-faster-more-secure</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-makes-real-estate-transactions-faster-more-secure</guid><category><![CDATA[Payments]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Real estate]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transactions]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Collateral]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Jenna Hall]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jun 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg5MTk5ODkzNTczNjc0Nzc2/20220501_btcfinal_best-jimmy-song---property-rights-bitcoin-songsheet-custom-art_-v2.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Jenna Hall, a content marketing specialist with residential real estate brokerage Redfin.</em></p><p>You may have heard about how you can use bitcoin to <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/can-you-buy-a-house-with-bitcoin">buy a house</a>, rent an apartment or save your wealth in an inflation-resistant way to make a down payment. But, beyond these examples, how else can Bitcoin transform the way real estate transactions work as a whole? </p><p>From cutting out middlemen to creating new collateral opportunities, Bitcoin can transform the traditional real estate industry in ways we never imagined. For instance, imagine buying a house without the need for banks or intermediaries, and completing the transaction within minutes instead of weeks. It may sound like a futuristic concept, but it’s slowly becoming a reality. </p><p>This article explores the exciting intersection of Bitcoin and real estate, and delves into the potential implications for the future of the real estate market. Whether you’re a homeowner, investor or simply curious about the latest advancements, read on to discover how Bitcoin is reshaping the landscape of real estate transactions.</p><h2>More Secure Transactions</h2><p>Real estate fraud continues to pose a threat to both buyers and sellers, with the FBI reporting over <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2022_IC3Report.pdf">11,700</a> victims in 2022 alone. However, Bitcoin has the potential to play a significant role in addressing traditional real estate fraud.</p><p>Bitcoin transactions are secured by cryptography, and once completed, are highly resistant to fraud. The cryptographic algorithms used in Bitcoin provide robust security measures against double spends, ensuring that transaction records on the blockchain remain tamper proof and protected. This added layer of security significantly reduces the risk of fraudulent alterations to payment or property records. And because all parties involved in a Bitcoin transaction — including a home buyer, seller, real estate agent and other relevant parties in a real estate transaction — would have access to the blockchain, they can collectively validate the property ownership and transaction details.</p><p>With Bitcoin, property ownership could also be verified through the world’s most robust blockchain, which can serve as a comprehensive and auditable record of ownership transfers. This feature could help establish a clear chain of title, allowing buyers to ensure the legitimacy of the property's ownership history before making a purchase. By eliminating ambiguity and providing verified ownership records, Bitcoin can prevent title fraud — a scam whereby criminals sell properties that they do not rightfully own.</p><h2>No More Middlemen </h2><p>Buying a home is complicated enough, and it can get even more complicated when you have to communicate with several parties to facilitate the transaction. However, it doesn’t have to be this way. Bitcoin is capable of facilitating secure digital real estate deals, which can eliminate the need for intermediaries like lawyers and bankers.</p><p>Traditionally, multiple parties handle listings, payment transactions and legal documentation, leading to complexity and additional costs. Bitcoin could theoretically take the place of the verification or payments services that these middlemen provide, streamlining the transaction experience. Buyers and sellers would benefit from reduced commissions and fees usually charged by lawyers and banks. Additionally, cutting out intermediaries accelerates the home buying or selling process, which provides a more cost-effective, efficient and competitive approach for both the buyer and seller.</p><h2>New Luxury Real Estate Investors</h2><p>Bitcoin has also opened up new opportunities in the luxury real estate market. High-end real estate properties, such as mansions, penthouses and vacation homes, are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/petertaylor/2022/05/07/crypto-just-became-real-estates-hottest-new-thing-heres-what-the-bitcoin-revolution-means-for-buyers-sellers-and-developers/?sh=7cb7800f388b">increasingly</a> being listed for sale in bitcoin or other digital currencies. This provides an alternative payment option for high-net-worth individuals who may hold significant amounts of bitcoin and would like to use it to invest in real estate. Additionally, the use of bitcoin in luxury real estate can attract international buyers, as it offers a faster and more secure cross-border transaction option compared to <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/global/real-estate-practices-around-the-world">traditional</a> overseas buying methods.</p><p>Newly-minted bitcoin millionaires and billionaires are showing a love for real estate, flooding the luxury market and driving some of the most expensive transactions over the past several years. Among the most notable include Olaf Carlson-Wee, the first employee of Coinbase and the founder of Polychain Capital, who bought a mansion in Hollywood Hills for <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/crypto-kingpin-olaf-carlson-wee-200452491.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACeKjjkndDF4c9MSaQARRyAEYe2MkZLNQkzq-akn_nevrMIKiACqtddwDpELMZhsXALRhoIdyTIY10CVxQlK3YzMLZo9Zx5esne83bX6axZqnPghtijCqpIgbBJ98soeirOePTEQU_EUQStB8qHuadoogoQkFGDRVswWtLF6jDhs">$28.5 million</a> and Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, who bought a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-ceo-brian-armstrong-buys-los-angeles-home-for-133-million-11641249787">$133 million</a> estate in Bel Air, California. Armstrong’s massive purchase still ranks in the top five most-expensive single-family homes ever sold in the <a href="https://www.redfin.com/city/11203/CA/Los-Angeles/apartments-for-rent">Los Angeles</a> area.</p><h2>A Better Payment Option</h2><p>One of the most intriguing developments in the real estate industry is the ability to purchase homes using bitcoin. While many Bitcoin users prefer to hold onto their BTC as a long-term investment, others choose to realize the distinct advantages that Bitcoin payments offer over fiat ones.</p><p>In fact, a <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/business/real-estate/2023/04/20/500k-or-175-bitcoin-texas-startup-lets-people-buy-real-estate-with-cryptocurrency/">Texas startup</a> recently made headlines by allowing Texans to buy homes with bitcoin. Buyers can choose to pay in dollars or their bitcoin equivalent for a property, highlighting the growing acceptance of bitcoin as a legitimate form of payment in the real estate market.</p><h2>Unique Collateral Opportunities</h2><p>Bitcoin could also be used as a new form of collateral in real estate transactions. According to the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/frequently-asked-questions-on-virtual-currency-transactions">IRS</a>, bitcoin holdings are considered property. At many banks, borrowers can use their holdings as collateral to secure loans for property investments, providing an alternative financing option for real estate purchases or developments. </p><p>This can be particularly useful for investors who hold significant amounts of bitcoin, but don’t want to sell their holdings to finance a real estate transaction. Lenders, on the other hand, can benefit from a wider addressable market when accepting cryptocurrency as collateral.</p><h2>The Evolving Landscape</h2><p>So, what does the future look like?</p><p>As Bitcoin continues to draw attention, regulatory frameworks are likely to evolve. Governments and regulatory bodies around the world are grappling with the implications of Bitcoin in real estate, including issues related to property rights, taxation and anti-money laundering regulations. The future could see increased regulation and standardization, which could provide more stability and confidence to buyers, sellers and investors.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Jenna Hall.

Describing the UAE's position as a forward-thinking financial hub, Gemini aims to tap into the country's growing market. The company is committed to becoming a global entity, according to the announcement, by meeting local regulatory requirements and understanding the needs of UAE crypto investors.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/Gemini/status/1664107397445550081"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>Gemini's decision to apply for a license comes as a result of its findings from the 2022 Global State of Crypto Report. The report revealed a significant increase in cryptocurrency adoption among individuals in the UAE, with many using it for in-person purchases. Additionally, the study indicated a strong intention among non-owners to enter the cryptocurrency space.</p><p>Speaking about the application, Gemini leadership expressed their vision of providing a safe, secure, and user-friendly platform for customers in the UAE and beyond. The company stated that it is eager to serve the rapidly growing and vibrant crypto community in the region. </p><p>In January, Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/gemini-alleges-dcg-genesis-defrauded-users">wrote a letter to its parent company</a> Digital Currency Group (DCG) alleging that DCG defrauded Gemini customers in relation to Gemini Earn.

At the beginning of May, Coinbase <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/coinbase-introduces-international-exchange-with-bitcoin-perpetual-futures">introduced its new international exchange arm</a> called Coinbase International, with the company stating that “countries around the world are increasingly moving forward with responsible crypto-forward regulatory frameworks to strategically position themselves as crypto hubs.”</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NDg4MTA1ODc5ODczMDI5/economic-chart-analysis.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[CleanSpark Announces Purchase Of 12,500 Antminer S19 XP Bitcoin Miners]]></title><description><![CDATA[The publicly traded bitcoin mining company is once again expanding its inventory of deployable miners this year in its quest for 16 EH/s.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/cleanspark-announces-purchase-of-12500-antminer-bitcoin-miners</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/cleanspark-announces-purchase-of-12500-antminer-bitcoin-miners</guid><category><![CDATA[Asics]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[CleanSpark]]></category><category><![CDATA[Antminer]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[Public Miners]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jun 2023 17:18:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgwODA0OTg3MjcyODMyMDg4/mining-rigs.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><a href="https://www.cleanspark.com">CleanSpark Inc.</a> has announced the purchase of 12,500 Antminer S19 XP bitcoin mining machines for a total price of $40.5 million. The machines were acquired at a lower price than the current market average, costing $23 per terahash, according to a press release shared with Bitcoin Magazine. The purchase agreement states that 6,000 of the machines will be shipped in June, with the remaining 6,500 set for shipping in August.</p><p>Zach Bradford, CEO of CleanSpark, expressed his confidence in the purchase, stating, "This purchase ensures that we are prepared to meet and potentially exceed our year-end target of 16 EH/s and also positions us to be one of the most power-efficient miners on an energy-per-hashrate basis." He further highlighted the optionality provided by the additional machines, allowing the company to replace less efficient units if the economics support it.</p><p>CleanSpark reported that it has been taking advantage of discounted machine purchases during the crypto bear market. In February, the company acquired <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/cleanspark-acquires-20000-bitcoin-miners">20,000 Antminer S19j Pro+ units,</a> followed by the purchase of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/cleanspark-to-nearly-double-bitcoin-mining-capacity">45,000 Antminer S19 XP units in April</a>. <br><br>Gary A. Vecchiarelli, CFO at CleanSpark, emphasized the importance of these purchases in preparation for the upcoming bitcoin halving, stating, "the efficiency of these machines also results in less power consumed per bitcoin mined compared to older generation miners, which should translate to higher margins."</p><p>CleanSpark's recent purchases of bitcoin mining machines demonstrate the company's commitment to expanding their mining capacity and staying competitive in the market. With fees from Ordinals inscriptions boosting the revenue for miners, it is expected that large players like CleanSpark will continue to bolster their miner inventory.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgwODA0OTg3MjcyODMyMDg4/mining-rigs.jpg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Should A Bitcoin Wallet Have Rights?]]></title><description><![CDATA[Like corporate entities or intelligent robots, Bitcoin wallets are poised to gain legal rights of their own.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/why-bitcoin-wallets-should-have-legal-rights</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/why-bitcoin-wallets-should-have-legal-rights</guid><category><![CDATA[Legal]]></category><category><![CDATA[Regulation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin Wallets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Legal]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Artem Afian]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jun 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MzI5NzY4OTU4MTc0ODk3/bitcoin-legal-regulation.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Artem Afian, a lawyer and “legal futurist” at Hiveon, a crypto mining ecosystem that offers services for Bitcoin mining hardware.</em></p><p>I want to draw your attention to the fact that Bitcoin transactions <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-are-bitcoin-wallets">ultimately occur between wallets</a>. There are humans behind wallets, but this connection is not really what’s important. The pseudonymity of Bitcoin is thanks to the fact that there is no direct connection between the wallet and the person who owns it. It is what distinguishes a Bitcoin wallet from any other financial instrument. No matter how much regulators try to change this, the core of the technology remains the same. </p><p>What does this mean? It means that, soon, wallets will be recognized as entities deserving of legal rights.</p><p>First, humanity <a href="https://aldf.org/article/laws-that-protect-animals/">began to recognize animal rights</a>. Now, there is talk about <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/robots-ai-legal-rights-3c47ef40">the legal rights of a robot</a>. Soon, the rights of a Bitcoin wallet will come to the fray. </p><p>When one talks about the rights of robots, they usually refer to some imitation of human will that is deserving of legal recognition. We understand that a robot does not have a soul in the same way that a human does, but at the same time, it performs rather complex actions, which gives rise to legal consequences. For many of us, a robot or a Bitcoin wallet is something inanimate and devoid of a soul and, perhaps, therefore undeserving of legal protections. But we recognize the rights of companies and corporations and, of course, it is difficult to imagine more soulless forms than those. It turns out that the subjects of law can be inanimate.</p><p>So, what is the difference between a Bitcoin wallet and a legal entity? A legal entity is simply a set of files in a specific registry. Lawyers even have a theory of the “<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/legal_fiction#:~:text=Legal%20fiction%20is%20an%20assumption,letter%20of%20the%20law%20unchanged.">fiction of a legal entity</a>.” We will calmly confirm that the legal entity is an American corporation. We can quickly check this. But how to check that a legal entity was created, say, under the laws of the country of Swaziland? Even if I show you documents that prove it, they are unlikely to tell you anything. So, if I tell you that you are dealing with a foreign company, you most probably just have to believe it. </p><p>Nevertheless, this legal entity, displayed as it is only on paper, has some rights. So, the Bitcoin wallet that exists is even more tangible than many legally-protected entities. Therefore, one more conclusion: Since legal entities have rights, then a wallet may have rights. Just like legal entities, wallets perform transactions, and just like legal entities, wallets can change their owners. This fact never changes: if robots or legal entities are deserving of legal rights, so too are Bitcoin wallets.</p><p>I think Bitcoin is an exciting new space and that we still have a lot to explore. Now, my idea that Bitcoin wallets will inevitably receive legal rights of their own may seem crazy, but many more discoveries await us.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Artem Afian.

This term came about as a catchall when some people incorrectly used or purposefully misused opcodes to create inscriptions that were not able to be indexed by ord and would therefore be unrecognized and not given an inscription number. </p><p>This issue was first mentioned on April 25 in the <a href="https://github.com/ordinals/ord/issues/2045">ord github</a> and the interim fix proposed by then lead developer Casey Rodarmor was to, “Modify ord to recognize the above currently invalid inscriptions, including retroactively in old blocks, but consider these new inscriptions ‘cursed’ and assign them negative inscription numbers.”</p><p>Funnily enough, the example inscription code on the Ordinals docs website would have been a cursed inscription.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/cbspears/status/1663292796306874369"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p><em><a href="https://twitter.com/cbspears/status/1663292796306874369">Link to embedded Tweet.</a></em></p><p>There are many ways cursed inscriptions can be created. Any inscription with multiple inputs/outputs would be considered cursed. As shown above, certain misuse of opcodes such as OP_1 can lead to cursed inscriptions. Alternatively, the introduction of OP_66 using a value of “cursed” intentionally made these types of inscriptions by having an even numbered opcode which is not indexed by ord. Unless already defined in the spec, even numbered opcodes are not recognized because they are reserved for future protocol development.&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ordinals/ord/issues/2045">Issue #2045</a>&nbsp;lists some of the ways it's possible to create cursed inscriptions:</p><ul><li>Multiple inscriptions per transaction, for efficient batching.</li><li>Inscriptions on inputs after the first, which is useful for collections.</li><li>Multiple inscriptions on the same sat, so that the entire history of a sat doesn’t need to be checked to determine if a new inscription is valid.</li><li>Inscriptions with unrecognized even headers, so that new even headers don't cause upgraded clients to disagree about inscription numbers.</li></ul><p>There are a couple specific debates around cursed inscriptions. One of the disputes comes from the way that these inscriptions are currently numbered. Cursed inscriptions are numbered negatively in the order of their creation. Because of this numbering system and naming convention, some people purposefully chose to create inscriptions and collections that appear “cursed” whether by flipping the image of a positively numbered inscription or using a more sinister image theme when inscribing. The question is: Should these be appended to the index of positively numbered inscriptions or should they keep their negative inscription number when the code is updated?</p><p>Additionally, another contentious conversation is what to do about the certain type of cursed inscriptions that used the OP_66 opcode in their creation. Because this opcode is not recognized by ord and even numbered opcodes are intentionally left out for future development use, it is debatable whether inscriptions using this opcode should be included in the cursed set or if they should be rejected.</p><p>At the present time, the <a href="https://github.com/ordinals/ord/pull/2109">issue around the even number opcode</a> is listed in the ord github. There are many comments in support of including these inscriptions in the index, but the lead maintainers of the protocol seem to be against it. As of now, the current stance by the developers is that these inscriptions would be unbound, meaning that they would not be assigned to a specific satoshi.</p><p>Remember, ordinal theory works based on a first in, first out tracking system for satoshis. Each inscription is assigned to the first satoshi in the genesis transaction when the inscription is created. This type of lens for looking at bitcoin allows images, files, text, etc. to be tracked and transferred. If a cursed inscription is unbound, it would not be associated with a specific satoshi and therefore would be unable to be transferred to another address. Many people who are inscribing are hoping to be able to sell or transfer their inscription to another person. While the inscriptions using this opcode will live forever on the Bitcoin blockchain, if these inscriptions are classified as unbound and unassigned to a specific satoshi, users who minted cursed inscriptions using this opcode would be unable to sell or transfer them.</p><p>Herein lies one of the bigger concerns for people who are spending money on transaction fees to create cursed inscriptions. If they are unable to sell them in the future, significant funds would have been wasted on fees. Many users have responded to the github issue, expressing support for including these inscriptions, but the code’s maintainers are not in favor of recognizing cursed inscriptions using the OP_66 even numbered opcode.</p><p>On May 30, the new lead maintainer of ord, Raphjaph, <a href="https://github.com/ordinals/ord/pull/2109#issuecomment-1568125568">wrote</a>, “As the protocol currently stands inscriptions are not valid if they use an unrecognized even tag, so this change already makes a concession by recognizing them. For now they are unbound but we might reconsider this and bind them in the future if there are strong reasons.”</p><p>This response is not what many inscribers were hoping to hear. Similar to Bitcoin, ord is open-source software so users can fork the code if they wish to recognize these specific types of cursed inscriptions. This contentious debate is ongoing and the path forward for ord remains to be seen. Users who spent significant sums on transaction fees may be willing to switch to a new version of ord that will recognize their cursed inscriptions, but this is only a theoretical path forward at this time.</p><p>Regardless, Ordinals are a new technology being built on Bitcoin. Whether inscriptions are a flash in the pan or if they have lasting power may depend on how this issue gets resolved.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwMzM1ODc0ODQyNTAyNTQ4/fiat-morals-angel-devil.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Liquidators Of Sam Bankman-Fried’s Alameda Research Have Scavenged $110 Million Of Bitcoin After Losing Billions]]></title><description><![CDATA[Analysis by Arkham Intelligence indicates that Alameda's liquidators have managed to acquire slightly more than 4,000 bitcoin.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/sam-bankman-frieds-alameda-research-has-scavenged-110-million-of-bitcoin</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/sam-bankman-frieds-alameda-research-has-scavenged-110-million-of-bitcoin</guid><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[FTX]]></category><category><![CDATA[chainanalysis]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sam Bankman-Fried]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bankruptcy]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 31 May 2023 18:51:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzMDI2MTUyOTY3NzEwNDE2/markets-trade-analysis-of-bitcoin-price.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Liquidators in charge of the recovery of assets for the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/sam-bankman-fried-and-ftx-largest-crypto-fraud-history">now-disgraced Alameda Research</a> hedge fund founded by Sam Bankman-Fried currently control over $110 million worth of bitcoin held in various wallets, according to a report supplied by blockchain analysis firm <a href="https://www.arkhamintelligence.com/">Arkham Intelligence</a>.

    </figure><p>The article featured a sweeping <a href="https://www.tributemedia.com/blog/what-is-a-hero-banner">hero video banner</a>, which was also used as a still image for social media sharing, <a href="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2023/03/27/107205_1_bitcoin_wg_1080p.mp4">showing smog-filled aerial drone footage</a> over operations run by Bitdeer, a Bitcoin mining company that occupies a previously-abandoned aluminum smelting plant on the outskirts of Rockdale. However, evidence suggests that the footage may have either been <a href="https://youtu.be/oN-dFfRPEkg?t=95">manipulated</a> or lacks the necessary color grading that would have maintained photojournalistic integrity and adhered to ethical standards.</p><h2>Color Histograms And Image Manipulation</h2><p>Color histograms are <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/tips-and-solutions/how-to-read-your-cameras-histogram">useful for analyzing the exposure and color balance of an image</a>. A color histogram is essentially a bar chart where the left side of the x-axis is black and the right side is white. The y-axis represents the number of pixels found in the image, for each part of the tonal scale between black and white. A properly exposed photograph, where the full spectrum of tonal blacks and whites are naturally found in a scene, will have <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/histograms-your-guide-to-proper-exposure/">pixels that span across the entire x-axis, from left to right</a>. When color data fails to span the entire x-axis, it can show that either those tones were entirely unavailable to the camera sensor, or that manipulation was performed to purposefully omit those colors.</p><p>In the side-by-side comparison below, the color histogram in <a href="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2023/03/27/107205_1_bitcoin_wg_1080p.mp4">the aerial footage published by the Times</a> (left) has no pixels approaching the black point. This is particularly strange for footage that has bright sun and stark shadows that are clearly visible as the camera moves over the scene. When color parameters are enhanced and corrected (as shown below in the version on the right), a brighter and more stunning scene emerges.</p><figure>

        <figcaption><em>The </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_histogram"><em>color histogram</em></a><em> for the image on the left, </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/09/business/bitcoin-mining-electricity-pollution.html"><em>featured on The New York Times</em></a><em>’ website, has a distinct gap between its color data and its black point, possibly indicating either an </em><a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/rescuing-poorly-exposed-photos-with-photoshop-levels/"><em>improperly exposed image</em></a><em> or </em><a href="https://youtu.be/oN-dFfRPEkg?t=95"><em>manipulation to add a smog effect</em></a><em>.

    </figure><p>The hazy footage used by the Times may give readers a false impression that rural Texas air has been polluted by Bitcoin mining. Bitcoin mines are fully electrified and, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-emissions_vehicle">electric vehicles</a>, the mining facilities photographed by The Times have <a href="https://twitter.com/RiotPlatforms/status/1645473961004892162">zero Scope 1 carbon emissions. In other words,</a> there are <a href="https://youtu.be/JKXeeiCa5Wg?t=1266">no direct greenhouse (GHG) emissions</a> that occur from sources that are controlled or owned by the operators of the mines. Any indirect <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/scope-1-and-scope-2-inventory-guidance">Scope 2 emissions</a> associated from mining’s energy use comes from the grid’s normal emissions.</p><h2>Reply Hazy, Try Again</h2><p><br>The alleged manipulation appears to have been indirectly confirmed by Jordan Vonderhaar, the freelance photographer who took the aerial footage in question. Vonderhaar published <a href="https://archive.ph/QVUQ9">another photo from the same drone</a> flight on his <a href="https://www.jordanvonderhaar.com">personal website</a>, showing that the weather was perfectly clear within moments of the hazy photo published by the Times. This clear photo, from a different angle, indicates that the missing color data in the hazy photo was not due to weather conditions.</p><figure>

Normalizing the black and white points on Vonderhaar's portfolio image reveals vibrant colors and a sunny morning in Rockdale. Notice in the side-by-side comparison below that the Times intentionally cropped out some of the blue skies when it published this particular shot:</p><figure>

Yet, the golden hues from the morning sunlight and blue skies are completely missing from the hazy hero footage. That a perfectly gorgeous moment in Rockdale could suddenly become hazy, at all altitudes and distances only nine minutes later, is nearly impossible.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Responding to allegations of manipulation, Vonderhaar — who described miners as “<a href="https://twitter.com/jordan_vondy/status/1645446668635058176">massive polluters</a>” — <a href="https://twitter.com/jordan_vondy/status/1645455851006640130">publicly stated on Twitter</a> that, “Nothing about the footage was doctored. It’s humid most mornings in Texas and when the sun rises you get low level haze. This is very common.”</p><p>Leaving aside for a moment that Vonderhaar appears to be admitting that he was perhaps intentionally seeking out hazy weather for his photojournalistic spread, the nearest <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/automated-surface-weather-observing-systems">automated weather observation station</a>, located at Hearne Municipal Airport — <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Alcoa+Lake,+Texas/Hearne+Municipal+Airport,+Crennan+Ln,+Hearne,+Texas+77859,+United+States+Crennan+Ln,+Hearne,+TX+77859/@30.7454462,-97.0029044,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x8644565ac202de19:0x7acb102f329d74aa!2m2!1d-97.0565663!2d30.5768948!1m5!1m1!1s0x8645cfa9fc4816af:0x37f2f4dc3c4a3e63!2m2!1d-96.6193961!2d30.8697362">40 miles to the Northeast</a> and well out of view of the aerial photography — <a href="https://weatherspark.com/h/d/145983/2023/2/28/Historical-Weather-on-Tuesday-February-28-2023-at-Hearne-Municipal-Airport-Texas-United-States">reported low-level fog</a> at that same moment. </p><p>Indeed, Vonderhaar's clear and sunny photo shows low-level fog on the distant horizon, many miles beyond Alcoa Lake. “Low-level” fog is not a high-altitude phenomenon, and sure enough, Vonderhaar's photo shows blue skies in the upper atmosphere and golden hues that are conspicuously missing in his smoggy footage, taken a few minutes later.</p><h2>Problems Uncovered</h2><p><br><a href="http://twitter.com/roryhighside">Rory Highside</a> — a VFX artist who has <a href="https://youtu.be/MT9PA5EvMuo">expertise in CGI video effects</a> — was among the first to notice problems with the footage that the Times had used. Analyzing the video and color histograms, Highside suspected that either the color grading was mishandled or the color balance <a href="https://twitter.com/roryhighside/status/1645726015233351680">had been manipulated</a>. One of the most noticeable issues was that the “black point” was extended, which is indicative of footage <a href="https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/18821/how-to-best-methods-to-correct-washed-out-jpegs">that is washed out</a>. This was evidenced by the fact that, as colors approached black, there was a noticeable and unnatural gap between pitch black and the available color data where darker colors should be. Vonderhaar did not respond to these allegations on Twitter, and did not respond to questions about them by email.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>The Hazy Truth Of Photojournalism</h2><p>Determining truth in photojournalism is a murky endeavor. The raw footage captured by professional-grade digital cameras can be thought of as the digital version of undeveloped film. Camera sensors capture raw data, which <a href="https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000241.shtml">retains maximum image information and flexibility</a> during post-processing, but requires processing and interpolation to produce an accurate final image. The photographer must adjust various parameters, such as contrast, white balance, exposure, and color saturation — meaning the photographer always has some artistic leeway in the final product. Color manipulations are trivial adjustments in post production. It only takes <a href="https://twitter.com/level39/status/1646204720963371014">one slight adjustment</a> to wash out an image. Minor adjustments are very common, and typically not an issue. But, at the end of the process, photographers have to walk a fine line between ​​enhancing an image for visual impact and maintaining its authenticity.</p><h2>Unedited Raw Drone Footage Is Visibly Hazy</h2><p><br>There is perhaps an alternate explanation for why Vonderhaar’s video footage was so hazy and lacking in contrast, while his still photograph taken nine minutes earlier was sunny and cinematic. The FC220 camera on Vonderhaar’s DJI Mavic Pro drone is <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/articles/4978813437/how-to-shoot-log-video-using-dji-s-d-log-color-profile">capable of capturing video footage in a logarithmic (log) color profile</a>. Raw log footage is a flat and low-contrast format — not intended for publishing — that preserves a wide dynamic range of details, which allows for greater flexibility during post-processing. Much like how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_(photography)">negative film</a> has inverted colors that enable positive images to be developed, log video footage <a href="https://youtu.be/pI9vIUwqLO0">always appears hazy when its raw, unedited format isn’t properly color graded</a>. It would be the photojournalist’s responsibility, then, to accurately map to the colors they witnessed in real life.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk4MzEzOTk0NTY0NDEyOTc0/color-grading.jpg" height="329" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption><em>DJI drones can record in a logarithmic (log) color profile, </em><a href="https://www.dpreview.com/articles/4978813437/how-to-shoot-log-video-using-dji-s-d-log-color-profile"><em>which appears hazy if it isn’t color graded in post-processing</em></a><em>. Source: “</em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccPJWVTdyA8"><em>Shooting In D-Log - DJI Mavic Pro</em>.”</a></figcaption>
    </figure><p>To convert log footage to an accurate color profile, a process called “<a href="https://youtu.be/o1m4LQu6BGQ">color grading” or “color correction” is typically performed</a>. This involves adjusting the image's color and tonal properties to achieve a more visually pleasing and accurate representation of the scene. <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/articles/4978813437/how-to-shoot-log-video-using-dji-s-d-log-color-profile">The proper conversion from log</a> involves mapping the tonal values in the log footage to their corresponding values, such as with lookup tables, or LUTS, to color grade the final footage.</p><p>Vonderhaar could very well have been telling the truth when he <a href="https://twitter.com/jordan_vondy/status/1645455851006640130">claimed</a> that “Nothing about the footage was doctored.” Indeed, publishing unedited log footage without proper color grading would quite literally result in a misleading smog effect, without having to do anything. Doing this deliberately, of course, would be unethical if it intentionally misleads viewers into seeing smog that did not exist.</p><p><a href="https://nppa.org/resources/code-ethics">Photojournalists have a duty</a> to maintain journalistic integrity and adhere to ethical standards to truthfully convey the events they witnessed. While there is no definitive "correct" color to any image, intentionally misleading readers by failing to color grade log footage is a breach of ethical standards. Photojournalists must depict the scene as faithfully as possible, avoiding anything that might distort reality. Publishing raw and uncorrected video footage, which actively removes colors from a scene and creates a misleading smog effect, is effectively a passive form of photographic manipulation. If not manipulation, then it is an egregious example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor">Hanlon’s razor</a>.</p><p>It should be noted that Vonderhaar’s lack of color grading may not be due to malice or even artistic bias. While a professional photographer <a href="http://jordanvonderhaar.com">who has expertise in color correcting raw still images</a> to JPEG may possess a solid foundation in color correction and a good understanding of color theory, it does not automatically mean they have the necessary skills to color grade log video footage. Color grading log video <a href="https://youtu.be/DBo3zsQq6mY">involves a different set of skills and considerations</a> compared to <a href="https://youtu.be/mPvJkhnB4xg">color correcting raw still images</a>. Expertise in video editing software and a specific understanding of the technical aspects of working with video formats — such as frame rates, codecs and color spaces — is a requirement to adeptly work with log footage. Managing temporal continuity and ensuring consistent color grading is critical to maintaining visual coherence. It’s entirely plausible that Vonderhaar was simply unable to color grade log video. But, whether it be malice or inability, the Times should issue a correction.</p><h2>The Signature Style Of The Times</h2><p><br>The Times has a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/jz4ver/what_creates_a_new_york_timesstyle_photograph/">signature style for its photographs</a>, where it typically&nbsp;extends the white point to darken&nbsp;images when it wants to portray a somber or moody tone. However, an extended black point — resulting in washed out colors — is the direct opposite of this iconic style.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk4MzEzOTk0NTY0Njc1NDEz/nyt-signature-style-histogram.jpg" height="476" width="620">

    </figure><h2>The Ethics Of Photo Manipulation</h2><p>All photography requires some form of color correction. Minor stylistic choices aside, adjustments that actively mislead readers <a href="http://spj.org/ethicscode.asp">are unethical</a>. A <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/17/world-press-photo-manipulation-ethics-of-digital-photojournalism/">2015 article in the Times</a> about a World Press Photo research project, for instance, explained that photo editors cross an ethical line, which becomes explicit manipulation, when their processing obscures an image to create conditions that were not actually in the scene:</p><blockquote><p>“The only point at which processing becomes manipulation is when the toning is so great — usually by transforming significant parts of an image to opaque black or white — that it obscures substantial detail.”&nbsp;</p><p>–“<a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/17/world-press-photo-manipulation-ethics-of-digital-photojournalism/">Debating The Rules And Ethics Of Digital Photojournalism</a>,” The New York Times</p></blockquote><p>According to Highside, the extent of the manipulation and our ability to restore the full color potential will remain unknown unless Vonderhaar releases his original raw footage. The Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ) recommends in its <a href="http://spj.org/ethicscode.asp">code of ethics</a> that journalists need to be proactive about addressing concerns and allegations of improper conduct:</p><blockquote><p>“Ethical journalism means taking responsibility for one’s work and explaining one’s decisions to the public. Journalists should: Explain ethical choices and processes to audiences. Encourage a civil dialogue with the public about journalistic practices, coverage and news content. Respond quickly to questions about accuracy, clarity and fairness. Acknowledge mistakes and correct them promptly and prominently. Explain corrections and clarifications carefully and clearly. Expose unethical conduct in journalism, including within their organizations. Abide by the same high standards they expect of others.”&nbsp;</p><p>–<a href="http://spj.org/ethicscode.asp">SPJ code of ethics</a></p></blockquote><p>Despite the missing color data, which can only be sourced from Vonderhaar’s unreleased raw footage, Highside was able to partially restore the washed out footage to demonstrate what the imaging could have looked like if a proper color grading had been applied. The results are striking when compared alongside the video that was published by the Times:</p><figure><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://content.jwplatform.com/players/J0dequ6B-6eHuiRBi.html" allowfullscreen="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption>New York Times Color Profile Comparison (; 0:27) </figcaption></figure><p>Intentionally deciding not to color grade or fully correct log footage is a breach of ethical standards in photojournalism. However, if it was due to lack of ability, it can still be considered a breach of ethical standards, particularly if the Times fails to correct the misinformation or take appropriate action to rectify the situation. A <a href="https://nppa.org/resources/code-ethics">fundamental principle</a> of photojournalism is to provide an accurate and truthful representation of events. Misrepresenting the visual aspects of a scene goes against this principle and compromises the integrity of the profession. It undermines the credibility of photojournalists and the publication, it damages the reputation of the profession and erodes public trust in the media.</p><p>It should not go unnoticed that the actual substance of the Times article included <a href="https://www.btcpolicy.org/articles/the-absurdity-of-the-nyts-latest-bitcoin-hit-piece">significant misinformation</a>. Why the Times <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/why-the-new-york-times-attacks-bitcoin">is seemingly motivated</a> to deliberately portray Bitcoin mining in such a negative light is unclear. But it&nbsp;appears to fit <a href="https://www.thegrayladywinked.com">a long pattern of distortions and bias</a> from the newspaper, which has become more evident to readers in recent years. When the public is being misled by photojournalists into believing a small and rural Texas town has thick smog typically found in populated and polluted cities, it’s necessary and appropriate to question the paper’s ethical choices.</p><p>Vonderhaar could clear up suspicions over his work by releasing the original raw log footage.

VP of Research at Riot Platforms Pierre Rochard <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinPierre/status/1663587667764736001?s=20">expressed gratitude</a> to everyone involved, stating, "Texas will continue to be #Bitcoin country!"</p><p>These legislative outcomes will contribute to the growth and stability of Bitcoin mining operations in Texas. As Brian Morgenstern, head of public policy at Riot Platforms <a href="https://twitter.com/MorgensternNJ/status/1663601172651835425?s=20">reported</a>, SB 1751 did not pass, ensuring the continuation of the state's usage of Bitcoin miners’ flexibility in balancing and stabilizing the power grid. </p><p>In contrast, SB 1929 successfully passed, establishing a registration process for Bitcoin miners to share information with ERCOT, enhancing transparency and grid reliability. Additionally, HB 591 was approved, providing a tax incentive for utilizing gas that would otherwise be flared into the atmosphere for on-site Bitcoin mining, promoting emissions reduction.</p><p>Another significant development was the passing of HB 1666, which introduced a proof-of-reserves regime, positioning Texas as a leader in building confidence within the digital asset ecosystem. These legislative achievements reflect the collaborative efforts of various stakeholders and industry participants, including Riot Platforms, The Texas Blockchain Council and the Chamber of Digital Commerce according to Morgenstern.</p><p>In addition to these developments, public miner stocks also surged on the news that the U.S. debt ceiling deal may be finalized soon, and that it does not include President Joe Biden’s <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/biden-administration-proposes-30-tax-on-energy-used-by-bitcoin-miners">proposed 30% tax</a> on energy used for Bitcoin mining. </p><p>While these successes mark important milestones, advocates acknowledge that their work is far from over. But the Bitcoin community remains optimistic about the future and the continued growth of the industry, with the positive outcomes achieved in Texas during this legislative session setting a favorable precedent for Bitcoin-related policies and innovation in the United States.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg1MDk0MzA2Njg2NjQxNDk3/img_7058.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Paxful Announces Appointment Of Interim CEO Roshan Dharia]]></title><description><![CDATA[Dharia will act as CEO as the exchange continues its transition from previous leadership under Ray Youssef.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/paxful-announces-appointment-of-interim-ceo-roshan-dharia</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/paxful-announces-appointment-of-interim-ceo-roshan-dharia</guid><category><![CDATA[peer to peer]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[CEO]]></category><category><![CDATA[Paxful]]></category><category><![CDATA[Exchanges]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 30 May 2023 20:12:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg4MTEzNjMyOTkzNzQ4ODg1/img_0295.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><a href="http://paxful.com/">Paxful</a>, a global peer-to-peer Bitcoin platform, has announced the appointment of Roshan Dharia as the new Interim Chief Executive Officer, effective immediately.

Just a month ago, The New York Times published a malicious <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/09/business/bitcoin-mining-electricity-pollution.html">article</a> on Bitcoin mining’s energy usage. Senator Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts has repeatedly attacked Bitcoin from a variety of angles, going so far as to launch an “<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/02/14/elizabeth-warren-anti-crypto-ftx-00082624">anti-crypto army</a>” targeting Bitcoin as a hazard to consumers, all while misleading the public on the environmental impact of Bitcoin. </p><p>These verbal assaults are not isolated and the examples above represent only a small piece of the uphill climb Bitcoin has to mass adoption. To put it mildly, Bitcoin is disrupting countless industries, making centralized authorities fearful of losing their monopoly on money and the power that accompanies it. Bitcoin essentially “calls the bluff” on corrupt bureaucrats and infinitely-inflatable fiat currencies that further enrich those who own assets while eating away at the purchasing power of those living paycheck to paycheck. Because Bitcoin is location-agnostic and capable of utilizing flexible loads, it naturally increases demand for the cheapest energy sources, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-uses-mostly-sustainable-energy">which are often stranded natural gas or renewables</a>. </p><p>So, why do many elected officials and companies attempt to denigrate and work to outlaw Bitcoin mining? Likely because their egos prevent them from understanding the value proposition of Bitcoin, but the facts speak for themselves. </p><p>Alana Mediavilla is a wife, mother, entrepreneur, business owner, filmmaker and Bitcoiner. She has a hell of a resume and a passion for storytelling. Armed with her knowledge of Bitcoin and skillset, Mediavilla decided to film and produce the documentary “<a href="https://www.dirtycointhemovie.com/">Dirty Coin</a>,” which highlights the value of Bitcoin mining while simultaneously busting the theory that Bitcoin mining is bad for the environment. </p><p>It was a privilege to hear her story and I know you will find her passion for Bitcoin inspiring.</p><p><strong>What is your professional background?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I've been an artist and entrepreneur my whole life. Couldn't help it. Started my production company in Silicon Valley 11 years ago and got recruited to be a video producer at Google Cloud for almost five years while I moonlit still running my creative agency for other big tech folks. In 2021, I parted my full-time ways with Google to focus my efforts on my company and my own IP and films.</p><p><strong>How did you first learn about Bitcoin and what categorically drew you to it?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I learned about Bitcoin during my daughter's ballet class in Campbell, California. A friend of mine that also had his daughter in the same class told me to buy as much as I could waste on bitcoin that week. He told me it would go up, so I degened into Bitcoin. That got me paying attention to it and when my Cuban grandfather told me he knew people sending bitcoin to Cuba, I dug into what the heck Bitcoin really was. What I found out blew my mind and continues to do so to this day.</p><p><strong>How do you typically respond to those who are dismissive of Bitcoin, especially those close to you?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I make a feature documentary explaining my position to them XD.</p><p>It's understandable to be against Bitcoin. Crypto is a clown show and many don't see the difference between Bitcoin and shitcoins. Add to that that many people were raised with an energy scarcity mentality so having some crypto "hog all the energy" definitely sounds alarming. The issue is that this is just not the case. Is the industry perfect? Hell no! But are we scrutinizing the energy use of other industries the same way? Are we studied enough to know about the situations where having an energy-hungry industry like Bitcoin mining can be a good thing, as in the cases with flare mitigation or becoming a buyer of last resort in the middle of nowhere?</p><p>Understanding more factual information about the space can't help but create better conversations about Bitcoin.</p><p><strong>In your opinion, why is it important to close the gender gap in Bitcoin interest and adoption?</strong></p><p>Bitcoin is for everyone. Closing the gender gap is bringing diversity of users and advocates into Bitcoin. Women are particularly good at influencing their social circles and communities. More women in the Bitcoin space means more women advocating for Bitcoin in a grassroots way. We need all kinds of people to root for financial sovereignty and that starts with conversations around the dinner table that mothers are very often responsible for leading. Whether a woman is financially independent or supporting her partner who is taking on that responsibility for the family, women understanding the importance of Bitcoin means more support to other women, people in their community, and most importantly, their families.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Becca Bratcher.

    </figure><p>It is set in a fictional world gripped by perpetual war between a sea-faring economic power and a population of monsters who appear to attack ships out of nowhere. The hunters, the heroes of the story, patrol the seas in a near-constant state of combat, fighting to keep trade routes open and safe. In exchange, they are paid after presenting proof of their monster kills to the monarchy. </p><p>It was a fairly overt critique of the military industrial complex, though the deeper theme that I saw was the toxic effects that the media propaganda complex has on a society, reducing peoples’ ability to exercise discernment, and obscuring objective truth. </p><h2>Learn History Or Repeat It</h2><p>I think the reason why “The Sea Beast”<em> </em>had such an impact on me is because at its core, it is a story of what can happen to society when truth becomes obscured by revisionist history and propaganda. In the end, it was up to individuals to exercise discernment, and break the societal trance that had been propagating violence for generations. In the end, the rulers only ever had power because the people had allowed them to.</p><p>American culture and history is rich with individualism and critical thought, such as the idea that taxation without representation is immoral. This ideal <a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/no-taxation-without-representation">ultimately led to the Revolutionary War which founded this country</a>. But now, people are afraid to have real and engaging conversations, especially in public, because it might be considered “wrong think” or offensive, ultimately leading to the cancellation of their public lives and digital exile.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/midyreyes/status/1629917053808148486"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>Bitcoin reinvigorates many things, but the most important I think is the discernment of truth.</p><p>Bitcoin is fundamentally an exercise in regaining your power of discernment. One must sift through a slew of propaganda and fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) in order to learn the truth and see true value. The journey that one must take in order to truly understand Bitcoin necessitates discernment and critical thought. And once we reach a critical mass, the intransigent minority becomes entrenched in the culture.</p><p>Furthermore, once you are able to store your hard-earned wealth in a self-sovereign way, the courage to speak freely becomes self evident. No more are the worries of cancellation and debanking. The changes in time preference as well will likely increase your savings rate, making people more financially stable and less fearful of leaving or losing a job that may be holding them back. </p><h2>‘You Can Be A Hero But Still Be Wrong.’</h2><p>I know that many Bitcoiners criticize the military and governments especially. They detest war in all its forms and hope to bring about the end of it with the dawn of a new, hard-money standard. This is, of course, a worthy goal. But I must urge Bitcoiners to separate the service members from the policy decisions they are charged with executing. </p><p>According to analysis from Jordan Peterson that I have seen, one of the main reasons individuals join the military is the desire to find meaning and purpose in life. Peterson argues that young men often lack a clear sense of direction and purpose, and the structure and discipline of military life can provide them with a sense of belonging and fulfillment. Additionally, the military can offer opportunities for personal growth, challenge and adventure, as well as providing a sense of pride and accomplishment.</p><p>Many have died in the pursuit, hence the day of remembrance that we celebrate on Memorial Day. And yet, some much-needed criticism has been quashed in the name of the troops. </p><p>The line, “You can be a hero and still be wrong” from “The Sea Beast” was especially striking in this context. Without the ability to see objective facts, it is difficult to ascertain objective truth. Discernment is a skill, a skill that has atrophied drastically throughout society in the passing years. It is perhaps one of the reasons why cries for the government to protect us have grown so loud.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/mindingottawa/status/1629959701227077633"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>There is no truth without debate and disagreement, characterizations of which have been elevated from being uncomfortable to becoming outright unsafe. And yet, creeping protectionism has its costs as well; the slow erosion of freedoms that we may never get back. The very freedoms that many service members have died to protect, the very service members who we are charged with remembering on Memorial Day. </p><p>If we are to remember and honor those sacrifices, perhaps the best way to do so in the current age is to exercise our discernment. Critical thinking is a skill that can be learned, or relearned in certain cases. Bitcoin helps those seeking to regain responsibility in their lives, and yes, exercise some critical thinking in order to discern fact from fiction, propaganda from news. </p><p>Bitcoin reinvigorates critical thought, critical thought leads to truth. Some have the humility to accept it. Others have to be slapped across the face with it, ultimately experiencing the pain of ego death. Truth is the only way to honor the fallen. Have the courage to choose truth, and live not by lies. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Mickey Koss.

Suddenly, a crisis hits. This could be the rise of an autocratic regime, a democide or an armed conflict. Whatever the circumstances, you will most likely have two pressing problems on your mind. First and foremost, you need to get everyone to safety, preferably abroad. Second, you need to preserve as much of your savings as possible to set up your life elsewhere. Since a safe escape from a disaster-stricken country depends heavily on individual circumstances, this article will focus on a savings preservation strategy that is globally applicable.</p><h2>Preserving Your Savings The Traditional Way</h2><p>Protecting the value of one’s savings while fleeing a country has never been easy. Those fortunate enough to have had any wealth before a crisis strikes may find it difficult to save it when there is a sudden need to leave the country.</p><h3>Real Estate</h3><p>So, you own your house, and chances are that you have benefited greatly from the easy money policies of the past decade as it has grown a lot in value over the years. You may be moderately well off on paper, but how easy is it to actually turn your house into money in a short time frame? The market demand might be heavily impacted by the very crisis that is forcing you to flee — for example in a case of foreign invasion, the demand for houses in the affected region will come to a halt, while the number of homeowners looking to sell will skyrocket. So, unless you foresaw a crisis looming ahead and sold before others, chances are you won’t be able to extract much of your home’s value when you need it the most.</p><h3>Savings In The Bank</h3><p>But let’s say you had good foresight and sold your house in time. Now you have a lot of money in the bank. Again, if the crisis affects the entire country, chances are you won't be able to withdraw or move your money fast enough. There are many examples in history where a "bank holiday" was announced and depositors were denied their money when they needed it the most. One of the more recent examples comes from Lebanon, where <a href="https://apnews.com/article/financial-services-lebanon-business-8ca0f73931d60e36c1dd7d40e77c25de">banks simply shut their doors and ATMs</a> to prevent clients from withdrawing their money in the midst of an ongoing economic crisis. If you think you can protect yourself against a national currency’s devaluation by owning a dollar account, you better think twice: In Lebanon, the dollar accounts were forcefully converted to a Lebanese pound that had <a href="https://apnews.com/article/financial-services-lebanon-business-8ca0f73931d60e36c1dd7d40e77c25de">lost 97% of its value against the dollar since 2019</a>. In fact, bank accounts may not be safe anywhere, as banks around the world operate in fractional-reserve mode, making them vulnerable to runs and subsequent collapses. Recent collapses of a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/03/17/regulators-shut-down-banks-raising-questions-about-neutrality/?sh=ddc2b5b71853">trio of U.S. banks</a> — Silvergate Bank, Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank — have proven this vulnerability.</p><p>However, it's worth noting that there is usually a several days’ delay between an emerging crisis and a full-blown bank holiday. If you suspect that banks might prohibit you from accessing your money soon, you can use this window of opportunity to withdraw your money in the form of cash or quickly convert it into bitcoin while it's still possible.</p><h3>Cash</h3><p>Let’s say you withdrew all of your money and kept it in cash. Hopefully, it’s in dollars or euros, as otherwise it might be hard to find a use for your local currency abroad, especially if the crisis that forced you to leave impacts the exchange rate, as it often does — the Ukrainian hryvnia<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/ukraines-central-bank-devalues-hryvnia-by-25-against-us-dollar-2022-07-21/"> has devalued by 25%</a> since the start of the Russian invasion. </p><p>Traveling with large amounts of dollars or euros also involves risks, though. The first of those is a risk of theft, either by common criminals or corrupt border patrols. The second risk is that, if you’re traveling with cash worth more than $10,000 or the equivalent in euros, you need to declare them when crossing the borders of many countries, <a href="https://help.cbp.gov/s/article/Article-195?language=en_US">including the U.S.</a> Failure to declare can result in the confiscation of the full amount. </p><p>Did you know that the U.S. customs guards confiscate more than $200,000 from travelers <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/local-media-release/dulles-cbp-officers-seize-over-350k-during-14-currency-reporting">on average every day</a>? And if you do in fact declare that you’re traveling with large amounts of cash, you never know where that information might end up — sensitive data that is collected can also leak. For example, in 2020, there was <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2020/03/us-property-records-database.html">a major leak of detailed personal data</a>, including the property records of 200 million Americans. Criminals can use this data for targeted attacks.</p><p>Cash is also getting gradually useless in the western world. In the euro area, cash usage <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2022/html/ecb.pr221220~62a7c988ef.en.html">fell</a> from accounting for 72% of all point-of-sale transactions in 2019 to 59% in 2022, and this trend is encouraged by governments that impose strict cash limits. So, even if you make it abroad with your savings in the form of cash, you’ll likely need to set up a bank account fast, which might not be a straightforward or easy task for a new migrant.</p><h3>Gold</h3><p>Gold used to be the most popular way to transfer value intact in the past, given that it has a worldwide demand and can be sold at relatively little discount (assuming investment-grade coins or bars are being used). Gold is also quite dense in value, as the price of 1 kilogram of gold is <a href="https://www.chards.co.uk/gold-price/weekly-gold-price-usd-per-kilo">around $60,000 at the time of this writing</a>. Otherwise, it faces the same risks as cash as it can be easily stolen along the way. Moreover, gold isn’t accepted as a means of payment and isn’t divisible, so you’d need to exchange your full coins or bars into the local currency after you arrive in your destination country.</p><h3>Stocks And Bonds</h3><p>Stocks and bonds are great fair-weather instruments, but they might become as useless as bank accounts when things get hairy. Local stocks and bonds will likely be worthless abroad and their value might be impacted by the given crisis. International financial instruments (e.g., U.S.-based exchange-traded funds) would fare better, though such instruments aren’t available in most parts of the world. And even if they are available to you, access to these instruments may be affected by newly-imposed sanctions.</p><h2>Does Bitcoin Fix This?</h2><p>You might have noticed that all of the usual instruments for wealth preservation have common traits in the form of limited transferability and/or value tied to a specific location or jurisdiction. Physical instruments such as cash and gold always carry a risk of loss or theft along the way, while intangible instruments such as real estate, bank accounts and stocks are, for the most part, valuable only locally.</p><p>Bitcoin indeed fixes this.</p><p>First, bitcoin is intangible and is therefore very easy to transfer. You can either send bitcoin to anyone globally within minutes, or you can remember the recovery seed and literally carry the bitcoin in your head (though that carries its specific risks as well, as we’ll cover below). Compared to other intangible assets, such as bank or brokerage accounts, there is no counterparty risk — you never need to worry about your money becoming inaccessible due to bank holidays, institutional failures or newly-imposed sanctions.</p><p>Second, bitcoin is a global asset, and as such, its value isn’t linked to any specific jurisdiction. A good example of this fact is the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/latest-china-ban-impacting-bitcoin">2021 bitcoin mining ban in China</a>, which seemed like a big deal at the time, since most bitcoin mining operations were located in China. Nevertheless, bitcoin miners simply moved elsewhere, and there was virtually no impact on the price (on the contrary, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/how-china-ban-improved-bitcoin-in-2021">bitcoin reached new highs several months after the ban</a>). Bitcoin is a global asset, but unlike gold, it can be bought or sold in all kinds of ways — on regulated exchanges, on decentralized exchanges, in ATMs, or from person to person; and the chances are, you will face a minimum spread on your exchanges.</p><p>Bitcoin’s intangibility, zero reliance on third parties and global liquidity makes it a perfect candidate for savings preservation in critical situations.</p><p>So, what are the specific methods for using bitcoin when fleeing a country?</p><h2>Traveling With Bitcoin Safely</h2><p>The main concern when traveling with bitcoin is to eliminate a single point of failure. If you just write down your recovery seed and put it in your back pocket, you undertake a great risk, as anyone who sees, takes or photographs your recovery seed has the ability to steal all your bitcoin. To travel safely with bitcoin, you need to minimize the possibility of loss or theft. Below are some tips on how to tackle this problem.</p><h3>Bitcoin In Your Mind</h3><p>To keep access to your bitcoin, the only thing you need to do is remember your recovery seed i.e., an ordered list of English words that is either 12- or 24-words long. Remembering 12 words is obviously easier than remembering 24 words, so it’s advisable to go for that option (e.g., by generating your seed on a Trezor Model T, which supports this format). Use a memory-enhancement technique such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci">memory palace</a>. If you’re traveling with your family, have all the family members remember the same recovery seed; that way, if someone forgets some of the words, you’ll still be able to reconstruct the full seed.</p><p>After you memorize your seed, try recovering your bitcoin in an offline wallet, preferably a hardware device (on Trezor devices, you can perform a<a href="https://trezor.io/learn/a/test-recovery-seed-on-model-t"> dry run recovery</a> that doesn’t wipe the device). Once you’re certain you have your recovery seed firmly embedded in your memory, wipe the wallet. If you want to carry your hardware wallet with you on your travels, make sure it is wiped, so that if you lose it or someone takes it away from you, there will be no possibility of its misuse.</p><p>On arrival, recover your bitcoin again in the wallet of your choice (make sure you type in your seed in an offline environment though!).</p><p>Don’t rely on your memory for longer periods. Traveling in an adversarial environment is the only situation when relying on your memory might be a good idea, but aim to minimize the time span in which you store your recovery seed in your head. For long-term storage, always write your seed down, or better yet, stamp or engrave it into steel (there are many products for this on the market; before you make a purchase, I recommend checking out <a href="https://jlopp.github.io/metal-bitcoin-storage-reviews/">Jameson Lopp’s stress tests</a>).</p><h3>Relying On Your Web Of Trust</h3><p>Another way to transfer your wealth via bitcoin is to simply send it as a bitcoin transaction to someone you trust. The person doesn’t even have to be in the country you aim to travel to; the important thing is that they will be able to keep your bitcoin safe during your travels, and send it back to you when you’re able to set up your new wallet in a safe environment. The most important factor here is trust. This may be off-putting to some (after all, we all know the mantra of “don’t trust, verify”), but the fact is that for some people this may be the way to go if they don’t want to rely on their memory and are certain that the person on the other side would never betray them. The person you’re sending your bitcoin to needs to be proficient in bitcoin, and ideally should own a well backed-up hardware wallet — after all, you don’t want them to hold your life savings on their mobile phones, right?</p><p>If you want to increase the security of this process, you can do so via a multisig wallet. Let’s say you set up a two-out-of-three multisig wallet and transfer your bitcoin into such a wallet. Now you can send one of the keys to Person A, the second one to Person B and carry the third one with you. Person A and Person B shouldn’t know about each other, so that there is no way to steal the bitcoin that is stored in this way. And if you lose your key during your travels, you will still be able to recover your bitcoin using the keys of Person A and Person B. You can set up your multisig wallet using Electrum, Sparrow or Nunchuk. To distribute the keys, make sure to use a secure, encrypted communicator such as <a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007318911-How-do-I-know-my-communication-is-private-#:~:text=Signal%20messages%20and%20calls%20cannot,encrypted%2C%20private%2C%20and%20secure.">Signal</a> messenger (do not use Telegram, as it <a href="https://usa.kaspersky.com/blog/telegram-why-nobody-uses-secret-chats/27662/#:~:text=By%20default%2C%20Telegram%20chats%20do,about%20the%20secure%20chat%20option.">isn’t encrypted by default!</a>).</p><p>Alternatively, you can utilize a Shamir backup, a cryptographically-sound method for splitting your recovery seed into multiple shares (use time-tested wallets such as the Trezor Model T to do this safely). Let’s say you do a two-out-of-three Shamir backup — the next steps are the same as we described above with multisigs. It’s advisable to reinforce the security of your Shamir backup by setting up a <a href="https://trezor.io/learn/a/passphrases-and-hidden-wallets">passphrase</a> on top of it.</p><h3>Plausible Deniability</h3><p>Ideally, there should be no indication that you are a Bitcoiner. That means carrying no hardware wallets, having no Bitcoin stickers on your laptop or phone, not carrying any Bitcoin books and deleting any Bitcoin/cryptocurrency apps from your phone. Do not talk about bitcoin with strangers or the border guards. If someone asks a seemingly-innocent question about bitcoin or cryptocurrencies, act ignorant or just say that you think it’s a scam. Simply said, you should look and act as a “normie.”</p><h3>Do Not Rely On Exchanges</h3><p>Some readers might be tempted to use their bitcoin exchange account — after all, you can log into it from anywhere in the world, right? I personally strongly advise against relying on exchanges with any portion of your savings. Aside from frequent exchange failures (just in the last twelve months, we saw the collapses of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-ceo-resigns">FTX</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/celsius-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy">Celsius</a> and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/blockfi-files-for-bankruptcy">BlockFi</a>, and a <a href="https://blockworks.co/news/gemini-earn-users-lose-savings">freeze on Gemini Earn users</a>), the exchange may block your funds, for example, because of sanctions or logging in from an IP address in a "wrong" country. In short, if you hold your bitcoin on an exchange, you don't really own it.</p><h2>Not Just A Theory Anymore</h2><p>Bitcoin is already used as a means of preserving one's savings in times of crisis. In recent years, we have seen success stories of this kind from countries as diverse as <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-financial-freedom-in-afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/23/opinion/sunday/venezuela-bitcoin-inflation-cryptocurrencies.html"> Venezuela</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/23/ukrainian-flees-to-poland-with-2000-in-bitcoin-on-usb-drive.html">Ukraine</a>. Due to its global liquidity and direct controllability, bitcoin is proving to be a valuable tool in critical situations. The more knowledgeable you are about the safe transfer of bitcoin, the better prepared you'll be in the event of such a situation arising.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Josef Tětek.

It should be noted that no investor worth their salt would tell you to put your life savings into crypto, but there is plenty of upside potential for those looking to make long-term returns or preserve a portion of their wealth this way.</p><p>Let me just mention a few of these advantages that make this investment in bitcoin worth looking more deeply into:</p><ul><li>Alternative store of value: Bitcoin is as good as it gets when looking for a store of value outside of third-party manipulation. Being decentralized means that it circumvents many of the red-tape aspects and fees that come with leaving your money in the hands of financial institutions. As a result, it is not subject to the same inflationary pressures that are so prevalent with companies operating in the government-controlled fiat currency system.</li><li>Potential for long-term growth: There is no doubt that bitcoin's value is extremely volatile in the short term, but its long-term trend has historically been a fairly bullish affair. The idea of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hodl.asp">HODLing</a> comes into play here, as you will really only be able to see the true value of your investment when ignoring the spikes and holding on for dear life.</li><li>Diversification: As I said before, investing in bitcoin does not mean that you dump all of your hard-earned eggs into the chaotic basket that is crypto, but you can provide some much-needed, future-oriented diversification for your investment portfolio. As <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/30/bitcoins-correlation-with-stocks-is-at-its-lowest-since-2021-as-investors-grapple-with-the-cryptocurrencys-narrative-shift.html">bitcoin's price is increasingly uncorrelated to those of traditional assets</a>, such as stocks and bonds, adding some of these digital coins to your portfolio can help spread out the overall risks that your investments might face from the old guard. In fact, what we have seen over the past few years is that bitcoin has become a new sort of semi-safe-haven asset class which many investors flock to the moment that old-school investment vehicles and fiat currencies come under pressure.</li><li>Accessibility: This goes down two lanes. On the one side, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/qai/2023/02/14/how-to-invest-in-bitcoin-for-beginners/?sh=25ed62097697">investing in bitcoin is becoming easier to do</a>, with many platforms and exchanges now offering a simple and secure way to buy and hold your BTC; while at the same time, it has never been easier to liquidate this asset and get fiat cash in hand when the need arises. This scores a massive point over the stock, bond or real estate markets, which are forever plagued by liquidity issues; especially in times of large-scale financial instability.</li></ul><p>In the long run, spending a share of your income on BTC is unlikely to make you poor. On the flip side, not allocating anything to BTC might ruin your prosperity, especially in these uncertain times when <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/what-caused-silicon-valley-banks-failure-2023-03-10/">banks can go bust without warning</a>,<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2022/09/09/cotw-how-food-and-energy-are-driving-the-global-inflation-surge"> inflation seems to be ever on the rise</a> and several countries <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/as-peso-inflates-argentina-needs-bitcoin">witness their fiat currencies turn into toilet paper.</a></p><h2>Why I Don’t Buy Or Mine BTC</h2><p>In the pursuit of acquiring bitcoin, there are always the obvious channels of hitting up some form of cryptocurrency exchange or peer-to-peer marketplace and just exchanging fiat for BTC. While there is nothing wrong with this approach, and it might be the easiest and perhaps the only option for many people out there, it is, in my humble opinion, not the best way to get your coins for wealth preservation. </p><p>You could instead go the route of the miner and spend a large fortune on buying all the equipment needed to try and get some BTC that way, but in this day and age with the <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/cp/the-cost-of-mining-bitcoin-in-198-different-countries/">average mining cost per coin being over $30,000 in many countries</a>, it is more likely that you will end up with zilch long before you ever mine your first coin.</p><p>So, what would I suggest? Earn it.</p><p>Sure, not everyone can convince their boss to pay them in bitcoin, but these days, many people have a side hustle that can easily be employed in generating some digital dosh. Five years ago, offering your clients the ability to pay in crypto for your services was a nonexistent concept, but <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1290483/crypto-payment-acceptance-by-industry/">today, it is a no-brainer</a>. Right now, a large number of my clients, especially those operating in the online world, are really into paying for services via crypto. While most of them like to use stablecoins such as USDT, you can easily flip these over to BTC and keep padding your Bitcoin wallet.</p><p>One more notable online activity that I partake in to stack some BTC is for the over-18-year-olds only. No, I don’t mean OnlyFans. I do some work in and around the gambling industry and also enjoy a bit of a gamble myself from time to time, but I solely gamble for BTC. </p><p><a href="https://cryptobetting.net/online-gambling-industry-growth-infographic/">Bitcoin betting sites have been gaining traction lately</a>, thanks to their ability to protect privacy, offer deals (e.g., bonuses, commissions, etc.) and general improvements over the annoying bureaucracy inherent in fiat betting sites. Obviously, I don't recommend gambling to anyone, but this is something I enjoy occasionally, such as when my favorite UFC fighter jumps into the octagon, as it adds a bit of excitement while watching the fights, and obviously, the winnings are added to my wealth-preservation BTC fund. </p><h2>My BTC Wealth Preservation Strategy</h2><p>You might be wondering why I am hammering on bitcoin and not paying much heed to the rest of the crypto pack. Frankly, as <a href="https://www.cityam.com/price-of-bitcoin-slips-as-other-cryptocurrencies-follow-suit/">most of the top tokens are following the bitcoin price like a donkey chasing a carrot</a>, I don’t typically diversify things or allocate a share of my crypto investments into other major coins and tokens. Don’t get me wrong, I believe that some of the cryptocurrencies out there are useful, but, as bitcoin is what determines the value of many of the top dogs on the list, sticking with BTC as my investment coin just makes sense. (For those keen on diversifying into other crypto projects, I do have one bit of advice; stay away from meme and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shitcoin.asp">shitcoins</a>.) </p><p>Now, let’s get down to business. Here is my advice for preserving wealth via bitcoin based on my own strategy:</p><ul><li>Plan: Whether you are investing with fiat currencies that you get from working a day job or getting paid directly in crypto via your own projects, make sure to have a well-defined goal. Set certain annual or even quarterly amounts that you would like to reach and try your best to make it happen. </li><li>Don't panic: Always work on increasing your BTC holdings and be ready to HODL until kingdom comes. Don't pay much attention to the fiat value and don't panic sell just because you see some of those crazy price swings that bitcoin is so famous for. It is all good and well to compare exchanges and cryptocurrencies, but do not sit there stressing about where the price of BTC is sitting. Short-term dips are bound to come and go, but if you believe in BTC as much as I do, then you can rest assured that your wealth is being preserved. Keep in mind that there are only 21M BTC available, ever. As this is a finite supply and the <a href="https://www.census.gov/popclock/world">world's population is close to eight billion</a>, with more people being added every day, the value of this asset is sure to increase over time as more governments and people take hold of this new shift in finance. If and when fiat finally goes completely bust and bitcoin takes over as the major currency, an average BTC per capita in the world is going to be around 0.0025, and you most certainly want to be in the top 5% of those holding it.</li><li>Keep it secure: Bitcoin is digital, and hackers are always on the lookout for those who are not keeping a watchful eye on their money. So, to preserve my wealth safely, I keep all of my bitcoin holdings in hardware wallets stashed in a safe place. There are plenty of good exchanges and hot wallets to choose from, but if you are serious about preserving your wealth, keep it cold, keep it offline.</li></ul><h2>Why You Shouldn’t Wait To Diversify</h2><p>Allocating a portion of your wealth to bitcoin can be an effective way to preserve it, and even grow it, but as the saying goes, “the best time to start is yesterday, the second best time is now.” </p><p>Don’t wait for <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/04/23/bitcoin-to-rally-past-50000-due-to-halving-process-say-crypto-analysts/">BTC to hit $50,000</a> before you suddenly wake up and start buying in. Set up a plan today and start diversifying your portfolio in this future-proof asset class, so you know your wealth is safe, no matter how bad your government might be.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Konstantin Riban.

Quickly amassing over 9,000,000 inscriptions, the new protocol allows for arbitrary data to be embedded on the Bitcoin blockchain. In addition to attracting attention from the NFT industry, Ordinals have led to a major increase in the fees required to send bitcoin, eliciting new debate on how Bitcoin should deal with <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoins-high-fees-create-controversy-and-challenges">high fee environments</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In a recent interview with Bitcoin Magazine, <a href="https://twitter.com/farokh">Farokh</a>, founder of the Rug Radio platform and a well-known collector within the NFT industry, shared insights into the world of Bitcoin NFTs and his vision for the Bitcoin inscription market’s future. Reflecting on his own Bitcoin and NFT journey, Farokh acknowledged the initial confusion surrounding Bitcoin in 2012, given the lack of development and user-friendly platforms at the time. However, he highlighted the rapid growth and development of NFT platforms in 2021, and how that is reflected now in the context of Bitcoin NFTs’ sudden rise in popularity.</p><p>When discussing the advantages of Ordinals, Farokh emphasized the security aspect of storing art on the Bitcoin blockchain, stating, "Ordinals now enable art to be stored on the most secure blockchain in the world, without keeping this data in external databases where it can be vulnerable to manipulation." He identified this as the biggest benefit of Ordinals over NFTs on other, less secure blockchains, recognizing the need for censorship-resistant and immutable storage solutions.</p><p>Regarding the future of Bitcoin NFTs, Farokh expressed his optimism. He also acknowledged the current challenges, such as high costs and the need for infrastructure development, but believed that with the continuous growth of the Bitcoin ecosystem, improved solutions would emerge.</p><p>Farokh also discussed the entry of luxury brands into the Bitcoin NFT space, mentioning the collaboration between <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bugatti-and-asprey-announce-bitcoin-inscriptions">Asprey and Bugatti</a>. He expressed his curiosity about high-end brands embracing ordinals and leveraging the security and authenticity provided by the Bitcoin blockchain.</p><p>When asked about the reaction of projects transitioning to Bitcoin NFTs, Farokh noted the generally positive response. He drew parallels to the early days of NFTs, where skepticism was common but ultimately proven wrong. He also highlighted the positive reception of projects like <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/yuga-labs-introduces-first-bitcoin-ordinals-collection">Yuga Labs’ TwelveFold</a>, indicating that the acceptance of Bitcoin NFTs was gradually gaining momentum.</p><p>Looking ahead, Farokh envisioned a mature Bitcoin NFT market with user-friendly platforms accessible to retail users. He remarked, "Look how much the [NFT] marketplace has evolved ... at first, it was complicated to make a wallet. Now we have proper marketplaces." Farokh's optimistic outlook suggested a future where the Bitcoin NFT market becomes more mainstream and user-friendly, ultimately driving further adoption.</p><p>Overall, Farokh's interview shed light on the growing importance of Bitcoin NFTs, their unique advantages and the evolving landscape of the Ordinals protocol.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgyMDU1MzM1MTk5MDU3MDI3/bitcoin-numbers.jpg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bitcoin Core Version 25.0 Released Bringing New Features And Transaction Use Cases]]></title><description><![CDATA[Bitcoin Core users should be sure to read through the release notes before updating their software to the latest release version.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-core-version-25-0-released</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-core-version-25-0-released</guid><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin core]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Updates]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technical]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 26 May 2023 16:22:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzMjU1NjA1NDIxNTQ5MTIz/technical-bitcoin-development-pixel.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Bitcoin Core version 25.0 has been released, bringing new features, bug fixes and performance improvements to the software. Users can download the latest version from the official <a href="https://bitcoincore.org/">Bitcoin Core</a> website or update their existing installations. The release notes outline the changes and provide instructions on how to upgrade.</p><p>One notable change is the allowance of transactions of non-witness size 65 bytes and above, which opens up new use cases and enhances protections against vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-12842. Another addition is the scanblocks RPC, which allows for fast wallet rescans by returning relevant blockhashes from a set of descriptors.</p><p>In terms of RPC updates, all JSON-RPC methods now accept a new named parameter called "args" for passing positional parameter values conveniently. Additionally, the verifychain RPC will now return false if checks couldn't be completed at the desired depth and level, providing more accurate feedback.</p><p>The release also includes changes to the build system, updated settings and new features. For instance, the shutdownnotify option allows users to specify a command to execute before Bitcoin Core begins its shutdown sequence. In the wallet section, new options like minconf and maxconf have been added to various RPCs, providing greater control over UTXO confirmations.</p><p>Bitcoin Core 25.0 introduces several improvements and optimizations, enhancing the user experience and security of the software. As with any release, users are encouraged to report any bugs they encounter to the official GitHub issue tracker.</p><p>Bitcoin Core is widely supported and tested on major operating systems such as Linux, macOS, and Windows.

    </figure><p>Congressman Brad Sherman's recent tweet attacking Bitcoiners as "tax evaders" is a prime example of how Bitcoin has become a mainstream phenomenon. It's ironic that politicians like Sherman, who have sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution and the presumption of innocence, are so quick to label Bitcoin supporters as criminals without any evidence. Such remarks undermine the fundamental principles of justice and fairness that underpin our legal system. </p><p>The fact that politicians like Sherman are attacking Bitcoin serves as a signal to those on the fence that there may be something to this "freedom money" that is constantly under attack by those who are corrupt and compromised by legacy systems. In a way, even those who attack Bitcoin may be unwittingly working for its success and adoption.</p><p>And clearly, politicians are expecting Bitcoiners to shoulder some kind of tax burden that they do not impose on anyone else.</p><p>Imagine if a politician tried to tax people for using computational power to do math or use English to express their views. They would be ridiculed and mocked because, on top of that being an insane policy, both of these subjects are essential to a functional society. </p><p>Instead of imposing arbitrary taxes, the government should focus on creating a regulatory environment that supports innovation and economic growth. Unfortunately, in opposition to that seemingly-obvious edict, the Biden administration <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/biden-administration-proposes-30-tax-on-energy-used-by-bitcoin-miners">has proposed a 30% tax on Bitcoin mining</a>, which is not only unfair, but also hypocritical to the values that make the United States great. </p><p>If a market participant has paid for their energy, they should be free to use it as they wish. So, why is Bitcoin mining being targeted when other industries, such as pornography, video games or gambling, also use energy to allow people to indulge in their vices online? I’m not vying for a tax on other industries. I firmly believe that if a market participant has paid for their energy they can do whatever they want with it. My intent is to point out that this proposal seems to be a clear example of government overreach and intervention in the private sector. </p><h2>Reacting To Change</h2><p>And it's not just Bitcoin mining that is being targeted. It is the entire Bitcoin network. When new and innovative ideas challenge the status quo, both humans and technology can exhibit resistance or embrace the change. Technology mimics many things about human biology, including the way we respond to change. Established industries or entities may resist new technologies to protect their own interests, just like how our immune system responds to foreign pathogens to protect our body. However, just as humans can adapt to changing environments, technology can also evolve and adapt to better serve our needs. People can either fight against Bitcoin or embrace it, but either way, this technology is changing the world rapidly.</p><p>It's important to remember that new technology, including Bitcoin, is not inherently bad, but rather a tool that can be used for both good and bad purposes. Instead of fighting against progress, we should embrace the opportunities that new technology provides and work together to shape a better future. Sherman's tweet may not win him any votes, but it shows his lack of understanding and respect for the rights of his constituents.</p><p>The comparison between a technology network and human biology may seem unconventional, but it provides valuable insights into the evolution and growth of new technologies like Bitcoin. Kevin Kelly’s book “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Technology_Wants">What Technology Wants</a>” highlights the importance of this. There are three quotes that really stood out to me:</p><blockquote><p>“Technologies do not exist in isolation, but rather in networks that amplify their power and reach.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“Innovation is a team sport, and the best innovations are produced by networks of people working together.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“The more interconnected our technologies become, the more emergent properties they exhibit, and the harder they are to predict or control.”</p></blockquote><p>Technology is always evolving based on human needs. It starts with a small idea and then grows into something larger than anyone could have imagined. This evolution is not always linear, as new technologies often emerge from existing technologies. These networks grow exponentially faster as new technologies enable stuff we never thought possible. FaceTime would seem magical to someone 100 years ago in the same way that a medical device that can regenerate limbs for people would seem magical in the modern day. I assume that type of technology will come someday and with it many more innovations that I could never have hoped to imagine until I saw them.</p><p>But, just like humans, technology has its own set of rules and laws. We have to follow these rules to make the most out of technology’s potential. Imagine if someone called a conference about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite">TCP/IP</a> a “conference for gang members.” It would seem ridiculous. Especially from a politician who should be encouraging innovation in their district. </p><p>Attacking people because they enjoy using a protocol is insane. However, if your job was dedicated to maintaining legacy technology and adopting new technology could make you irrelevant, I suppose you wouldn't react favorably toward the new technology either.</p><h2>Embracing The Evolution Of Technology</h2><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk4MTczOTE3Njk1NzgwMDMw/college-tuition-prices-rising.png" height="587" width="620">

    </figure><p>In the end, we are all part of the network of technology, whether we like it or not. We must embrace the evolution of technology, and understand its potential to shape the world for the better. We are at the beginning of all the things that will be built on these new protocols, so it is up to us to harness their power and make the most out of their potential. </p><p>I can’t say I know for a fact that bitcoin is going well above $1 million, but I think it’s pretty damn possible and that, as more network effects get added, both in meatspace and cyberspace, the more likely it becomes.</p><blockquote><p>“When zero reached Europe roughly 300 years later in the High Middle Ages, it was met with strong ideological resistance. Facing opposition from users of the well-established Roman numeral system, zero struggled to gain ground in Europe.”&nbsp;</p><p>–Robert Breedlove, “<a href="https://breedlove22.medium.com/the-number-zero-and-bitcoin-4c193336db5b">The Number Zero And Bitcoin</a>”</p></blockquote><p>Now, the idea of not using zero in math is a non-starter. It seems highly likely Bitcoin will have a similar fate as zero and the idea of not using Bitcoin and all the things built on top of it will be preposterous. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/nostr-and-bitcoin-can-change-social-media">Just look at Nostr, for an example</a>. There is no way the protocol would have thrived had it not been for both Bitcoin and Bitcoiners bringing so much value onto the network.</p><p>I believe a similar effect will take place for more innovations around the world, whether regulators understand Bitcoin or not.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Conor Chepenik.

This means it is 48.71 trillion times harder to mine a Bitcoin block today than when mining first began in 2009 — a compound increase of 20.64% per month.</p><p>At the time of this writing, Bitcoin’s difficulty is at an all-time high, which means that miners — on a BTC basis — are making less in rewards per unit of hash rate than ever before. Next to bitcoin’s price, Bitcoin’s difficulty is a primary factor that influences <a href="https://data.hashrateindex.com/network-data/btc">hash price</a> (<a href="https://data.hashrateindex.com/chart/bitcoin-hashprice-index">mining revenue per unit of hash rate</a>), so miners are interested in projecting Bitcoin’s <a href="https://data.hashrateindex.com/chart/bitcoin-network-hashrate">hash rate</a> growth and difficulty trends for business planning.</p><p>To this end, miners and Bitcoiners devised the constant-block-time method for estimating upcoming adjustments, but this method typically over or under estimates difficulty changes at the beginning of each difficulty epoch.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>To improve on this, the team at Luxor Technologies developed a new method called the “rolling-block method,” which we describe in more detail in <a href="https://hashrateindex.com/blog/difficulty-forecasting-101-for-bitcoin-miners-hosters-lenders-and-hashrate-traders/">a recent report on forecasting Bitcoin mining difficulty.</a></p><p>It’s our hope that the rolling-block method for forecasting Bitcoin difficulty could provide miners, investors and hash rate traders a better tool to plan for difficulty changes</p><h2>Luxor's ‘Rolling Block Method’ For Forecasting Difficulty Adjustments</h2><p>For this report, we developed a new time series forecasting method for upcoming difficulty adjustments, which improves accuracy at the beginning of the epoch compared to the constant block time method. We call this the succinctly-named “rolling-2,015-block, square-root-weighted, epoch-adjusted block time method” (or just “rolling-block method,” “adjusted-block-time method,” or “dual-epoch method”).</p><p>This new method improves upon the constant-block-time method early in the epoch by including block times from the previous 2,015 blocks, instead of just the blocks from the current epoch, which can skew forecasts early in the epoch for lack of data points. To account for the change in network difficulty between epochs, block times in the previous epoch are adjusted by the previous adjustment. And finally, we weight the average block times of the current epoch with the square of the proportion through the epoch. This final step is to diminish the impact of block times from the previous epoch as the current epoch progresses since these values do not actually determine the upcoming adjustment.</p><p>In the chart below, we can see through confidence intervals that the new method performed better than the old model at the beginning of the epoch up to block 650, but it performed slightly more poorly thereafter:</p><figure>

    </figure><p>This forecast, of course, is only for projecting the next difficulty adjustment. What if we wanted to forecast, say, a year into the future?</p><h2>Long-Term Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Forecasting</h2><p><a href="https://hashrateindex.com/blog/the-search-for-a-hashprice-floor-or-downside-resistance/">Luxor has developed models for long-term difficulty forecasting</a>, as well, but these models are obviously much more complex, since they span a longer time frame.</p><p>Our model takes the bitcoin price, transaction fees and block subsidy as inputs on the demand side, and internal data on ASIC production estimates and operating cost distributions across the industry on the supply side. Using these inputs, the model produces an equilibrium hash rate, difficulty and hash price for 18-month periods.</p><p>The model structure reflects reality; hash rate, difficulty and hash price are endogenous to the system, not exogenous determinants of one another. We can conduct sensitivity analyses with the model across all inputs as well. For example, we can forecast an equilibrium hash rate, difficulty, and hash price across a range of bitcoin prices.</p><p>The charts below present projections from our updated hash rate supply and demand model. It provides estimates for flat, bull and bear bitcoin price scenarios.</p><figure>

In an interview conducted at Bitcoin 2023 in Miami Beach, MicroBT's COO, Jordan Chen, emphasized the company's commitment to developing a solar power mining solution. According to Chen, "Solar power is a perfect power source for bitcoin mining, both in terms of decentralization and sustainability." He further explained that MicroBT is working with partners along the value chain to provide a mature solution that utilizes solar power for mining worldwide.</p><p>Chen elaborated on the adjustment of voltage and frequency in MicroBT's Whatsminer rigs to adapt to the change in solar power. He stated, "The mining machine has to adapt to the power changes so as to keep mining throughout the day with various working voltage and frequency." Chen highlighted that this dynamic adjustment only costs about "1% to 2% efficiency compared to traditional shut-down-and-reboot method," ensuring continuous mining operations and optimizing revenue.</p><p>Discussing the cooling methods in <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/microbt-releases-new-line-of-whatsminer-m50-series">the new Whatsminer M50 series</a>, Chen provided insights into the benefits and unique features of each method. He explained, "Air-cooling is taking away heat via fans, while hydro-cooling uses water-cooling pads which eliminate the need for fans, heat sinks, and offer a longer lifetime." Regarding immersion cooling, Chen highlighted its advantages, stating, "It's really no dust, no exposure to corrosive air, low noise and a longer lifetime."</p><p>Chen shared MicroBT's focus on heat utilization scenarios, stating, "The heat generated during the mining process will be transferred to an outside heating loop through a heat exchanger." He further explained that the heat recovery ratio can be as high as 95%. Chen emphasized MicroBT's collaboration with customers on various applications, such as providing heating services to communities and generating steam for industrial uses like food processing.</p><p>When discussing MicroBT's vision for the future of Bitcoin mining, Chen emphasized their commitment to leveraging renewable energies and maximizing the reuse of heat generated during mining. He stated, "Our vision is allowing bitcoin mining to make a bigger and bigger positive contribution to society," with a focus on minimizing carbon emissions and carbon footprint.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgzMjM5NTgzMDQyMDUzMTU4/img_6181.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[BIT Mining And Chain Reaction Partner To Create New Bitcoin Mining Systems]]></title><description><![CDATA[The partnership will leverage Chain Reaction’s ASIC announced at Bitcoin 2023 to further develop systems for miners.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bit-mining-and-chain-reaction-partner-to-create-new-bitcoin-mining-systems</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bit-mining-and-chain-reaction-partner-to-create-new-bitcoin-mining-systems</guid><category><![CDATA[Mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[BIT Mining]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 24 May 2023 19:58:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyNjA3MTM2MjI2NzQ4MTUz/20220926_good-gdog-proof-collaborative-custody-multisig-by-will-schoellkopf_.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>BIT Mining Limited has announced a collaboration with semiconductor company Chain Reaction to develop next-generation systems for bitcoin mining.

Your Twitter feed has probably been drowning in threads and tips from AI bros who have discovered 99 ways for you to save 99 hours every week using ChatGPT or some other list of 99 AI apps.</p><p>I’m sick of it too. Trust me, especially considering that most of these AI “experts” were Web3 “experts” last year, NFT “experts” the year before and DeFi or crypto “experts” before that. Trend hopping at its finest.</p><p>That’s not to say there’s no value here to be found here. Somewhere beneath or behind the almost-deafening noise coming from these influencooors there is a possible paradigm shift, and a genuine set of use cases. We’ve seen some already, of course. </p><p>You can chat with these models to reason out a problem, you can summarize thoughts and ideas, find correlations between ideas, search for <em>some</em> information better than you could with Google and, of course, build more linguistically-functional chatbots. Perhaps the best use case thus far are the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/google-jumps-into-the-ai-coding-assistant-fray-with-codey-and-studio-bot/">dev-assistant tools</a>, but I get the sense that we’ve not yet seen the “Uber moment.”</p><p>There is also — somewhere beneath and behind all of the scary talk of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence">artificial general intelligence (AGI)</a> and the idiocy being proposed by <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/">bureaucrats and would-be regulators</a> — a more human-centric, human-enhancing use for these tools.</p><p>The idea of a language user interface as the next step from the thumb tapping we’ve become used to over the past decade is fascinating, and what we should be thinking about is how to make these tools new “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ebenbayer/2023/05/15/ai--biotechnology-show-its-time-to-think-past-bicycles-for-the-mind/?sh=2c7868754ea1">bicycles for the mind</a>,” as Steve Jobs said about computers. It’s very important that we push back against doomer narratives that lean the world toward “approved AI” in order to avoid such tools becoming yet another appendage of the State.</p><p>In this short article, I’d like to explore the ideological AI battlefield and its relationship to Bitcoin. Some pretty important battle lines have been drawn, and we must all be aware of them.</p><h2>Bitcoin Remains The Most Important Thing In The World</h2><p>Energy is still the currency of the universe. That’s not changing, and will never change. At the risk of sounding like too much of a hippie: It’s all energy.</p><p>People often forget that, and this recent AI hype cycle is a clear example. Most people you talk with, even otherwise smart people, think that AI is the biggest thing happening in the world today, and that it’s mankind’s most important innovation.</p><p>I think they’re wrong, in a big way. They’re missing something more foundational.</p><p>AI is a tool. When applied well, it’s a very effective tool. But however effective a tool it may be, it needs energy to run. Yes, it can and will enhance how we use and allocate energy, but ultimately, it is an amplifier. A tool. An “engine,” so to speak.</p><p>What is Bitcoin?</p><p>Well, Bitcoin is <em>like</em> energy. <em>Before the Saylor-haters out there screech about that not being literally accurate: I know! It’s a metaphor, and in my opinion, a useful one</em>. It’s useful because, in the same way we can essentially use energy to measure everything else, money is a measure that helps us (implicitly) account for energy, time and material resources. </p><p>If we understand that Bitcoin, on a long enough time scale (generationally speaking, not civilizationally) becomes <em>money</em>, then here’s the truth that AI people are missing:</p><p><strong>Bitcoin benefits from all of it, because Bitcoin is the foundation. Everything that happens, every technology, every tool, every innovation, enlarges the total Bitcoin pie.</strong></p><p>So, don’t get it twisted: AI is big, <em>but Bitcoin remains king.</em></p><p>Of course, in terms of financial returns, VC money and the like, AI companies will probably outpace both bitcoin returns (in the short term) and also Bitcoin company returns, but that’s to be expected in a fiat world where hype prevails over sanity, and we experience abnormal cyclicality.</p><p>AI is also undergoing a sort of renaissance, so there is lots of buzz. This will, in time, stabilize and as bitcoin becomes the unit of account, lo and behold, all of the <em>real</em> value generated from AI will ultimately accrue to bitcoin and bitcoin holders.</p><p>So, don’t stress if you’re feeling FOMO on AI. Don’t worry about changing your entire life around because some ex-crypto-turned-AI-expert guy wrote a viral tweet telling you about some new, generative AI tool that will obsolete some and make others mega rich.</p><p>Slow and steady continues to win the race. Bitcoin continues to be king.</p><h2>AI Is An Amplifier</h2><p>The second thing we need to realize is this: AI is like the computer or any other technology, for that matter.</p><p>It’s an engine. <em>It’s an amplifier.</em></p><p>It will amplify madness, stupidity and lies, or it will amplify soundness, sanity and truth.</p><p>It can be used as a tool of control and stupidification, or it can be used as a tool for liberating oneself from minutia and for enhancing one’s intelligence.</p><p>The direction we wind up ultimately depends on you.</p><p>Which tools are you using? Which do you demand? Which are you building? Which are you supporting?</p><p>Companies like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/19/snapchat-making-ai-chatbot-similar-to-chatgpt-available-to-every-user">Snapchat are building AI tools</a> to infect your mind with nonsense:</p><figure>

    </figure><p>OpenAI is busy guard-railing ChatGPT to such a degree that it spends <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/openai-sorry-chatgpt-bug-leaked-payment-info-to-other-users">more time apologizing and moralizing</a> than it does answering actual questions.</p><p>Bard is, likewise, <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/tech/7719664/googles-bard-ai-chatbot-accused-left-wing-bias/">regurgitating the same kind of garbage</a>, likely because it’s been neutered by “bias-removal” tools and toxicity filters.</p><p>These stupidities only serve to constrain people’s accepted thinking and speech, which results in a homogenization of thought. This can have two effects. In the worst case, so-called “safety concerns” lead to “approved AI” which ultimately leads to an internet that is accessed through chat filters with approved speech conditions. The alternative is if we push back and build alternatives. Their ignorance becomes our opportunity. While they focus on wokeness, we can build utility and authenticity. </p><p>Which brings me to my final point:</p><h2>We’re In A Global AI Arms Race</h2><p>The race is between two versions of the world:</p><ol><li>On the one hand, we have woke, generalist AIs that everyone is forced to use because newly-formed regulatory bodies deem them “safe” (see the <a href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/how-china-might-crush-the-west-in?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_campaign=post_embed&amp;utm_medium=web">ridiculously-moronic work being done by Gary Marcus</a> to set up such a global committee).</li><li>On the other, we have a future of distributed, more sovereign tools that people can choose from, that the user evaluates on merits they deem important.</li></ol><p>I know which future I want to see, and instead of sitting on the sidelines complaining, I’m working toward building alternative or parallel solutions.</p><p>In a future article, I’ll lay out what myself and a few really talented individuals have been working on. A beautiful marriage of Bitcoin as the focal point and Ai as the engine. </p><p>In the meantime, know this: <strong>The battle lines have been drawn.</strong></p><p>It’s iris-scanning, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f1de2aee-ee13-45e1-bd61-0a269cd650d3">like World Coin</a> on one end, conveniently run by the same leadership as OpenAI, versus Bitcoin and smaller, more accurate, specialized and open-source language models on the other.</p><figure>

According to the complaint, Upstream holds the patent for a system that powers a blockchain mine at remote oil well sites using stranded gas to generate electricity for cryptocurrency mining. According to the filing, the company has deployed over 350 bitcoin mining systems across the U.S. and Canada, addressing the issue of stranded gas venting and flaring.</p><p>Crusoe, which manufactures and operates cryptocurrency mining systems connected to stranded natural gas sources, is accused of competing with Upstream by selling and operating similar systems. The complaint claims that Crusoe's "Digital Flare Mitigation" systems infringe on Upstream's patented technology. The lawsuit further alleges that Crusoe was aware of Upstream's patented technology during the development of its own products. The lawsuit filing highlights instances where Crusoe identified Upstream as a competitor in blog posts and claims made in patent applications.</p><p>The lawsuit seeks damages and injunctive relief against Crusoe for patent infringement. Upstream argues that Crusoe's actions have caused harm to its business by infringing on its patent rights and creating unfair competition in the market.&nbsp;</p><p>The case will be heard in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, where Crusoe has regular and established places of business according to the filing. Also noted in the lawsuit is a complaint filed against a customer of Upstream in Crusoe Energy Systems LLC v. Alkane Midstream LLC, which the lawsuit says "further confirm[s] Crusoe’s significant and substantial contacts with this district." Upstream asserts in the lawsuit that the court has jurisdiction over the case.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzMzUxMjcwOTg2MTYzNzc5/mining-pick-axe.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[How To Figure Out If You Should Start Mining Bitcoin]]></title><description><![CDATA[Turning a profit from Bitcoin mining is a challenge, but not impossible.

The mining process plays a crucial role in confirming new transactions and maintaining the Bitcoin blockchain ledger as an immutable record of transactions. In essence, miners use ASIC hardware to solve complex computational problems, with the first one to find the solution earning a reward of bitcoin before the cycle restarts. </p><p>Though Bitcoin mining can be time-consuming, expensive and can yield inconsistent rewards depending on price volatility, it still holds a strong allure for investors drawn to the idea of earning bitcoin as compensation for their efforts. For tech-savvy individuals and hobbyists, mining can be an intriguing opportunity for many different reasons.</p><p>As opposed to traditional investment assets, such as standard bank deposits, real estate property or stocks, bitcoin can offer much higher returns. It’s an environmentally-conscious business that can prevent energy waste by utilizing excess energy, such as the natural gas that gets burned during oil extraction, idle wind turbines and surplus energy from hydroelectric or nuclear power plants. </p><p>Hiveon’s long-term predictions are that bitcoin’s value will rise after the halving (more on that below), so we’re accumulating coins now to multiply that money into the future. We also believe that, in the future, an alternative global financial system based on blockchain technology like Bitcoin’s will be dominant, and network validators will be able to make money from processing transactions.</p><p>But with mining difficulty and hash rate <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/225359/bitcoin-difficulty-hashrate-miner-revenue">continuously hitting new highs</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-network-overwhelmed-by-390000-unconfirmed-transactions-and-surging-fees/">fees surging</a>, many may wonder if the practice is still worth investing in.</p><h2>Is Mining Bitcoin Worth It?</h2><p>To determine if Bitcoin mining will be “worth it” for them, equipment, prospective miners should conduct cost-benefit analyses to determine their break-even points. Factors to consider include power costs, hardware costs and efficiency, time and the market value of bitcoin. You can choose to factor in the current BTC price ($28,190 at the time of writing) or, attempt to extrapolate where you believe the price of BTC will be in the future.</p><h3>Power Costs</h3><p>At the time of this writing, Bitcoin mining can be profitable for individuals who pay <a href="https://whattomine.com/miners/163-bitmain-antminer-s19j-pro-96th?cost=0.11&amp;cost_currency=USD&amp;button=">$0.10 or less per kilowatt hour (kWh)</a> of power.</p><p>Access to energy at this price, however, can vary significantly across different regions, with some areas offering notably cheaper electricity than others. In terms of <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/263492/electricity-prices-in-selected-countries/">household electricity prices</a>, several Middle Eastern countries would make good homes for Bitcoin miners, including Iran, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile, prices in European countries like Denmark, Germany and the U.K., would make Bitcoin mining a difficult proposition.</p><h3>Hardware Costs</h3><p>Acquiring ASIC equipment has become relatively easy, although the price of ASICs ranges from a few hundred dollars to five-figure sums. I recently found a used Antminer S19 for sale in the U.K., listed at £2,700 (or about $3,343.38).</p><h3>Market Value</h3><p>Bitcoin achieved its highest price ever at <a href="https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoin/historical-price/">$67,549 in November 2021</a>. During this period, as the 2021 bull market reached its peak, miners’ bitcoin rewards were naturally more valuable in fiat terms than they are at the time of this writing, with the bitcoin price around $27,600. However, with <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoins-high-fees-create-controversy-and-challenges">bitcoin transaction fees rising</a> as a result of ongoing experimentations with block space, miners are benefitting.</p><p>A <a href="https://btc.com/tools/mining-calculator">profitability calculator</a> can help potential miners evaluate the cost-benefit ratio of Bitcoin mining. These calculators can vary in complexity and may provide slightly different results. </p><h2>What Are The ‘Other’ Reasons For Bitcoin Mining?</h2><p>But for some Bitcoin miners, a simple cost-benefit analysis may not be the only factor in deciding whether mining is “worth it” or not in 2023.</p><p>Mining is an essential aspect of Bitcoin's decentralized transaction recording and validation process. Bitcoin mining serves a critical purpose by addressing an issue called “double spending,” a problem inherent in any digital currency system. Double spending is the digital equivalent of counterfeiting, which is kept in check in the physical world by middlemen like governments and banks. </p><p>For Bitcoin, this need to trust third parties has been replaced largely because of the computational effort provided by miners. Maintaining that freedom from middlemen, in addition to collecting revenue, may be a motivation to contribute to the mining network for some.</p><h2>Bitcoin Halving Cycles And What to Expect In 2024</h2><p>The <a href="https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/bitcoin/halving#:~:text=When%20is%20the%20Next%20Bitcoin%20Halving%20Date%3F,to%203.125%20Bitcoin%20per%20block.">next anticipated Bitcoin halving in April 2024</a> will likely have a significant impact on the mining dynamic.</p><p>A Bitcoin halving is an event in which the reward for mining new blocks is reduced by 50%, resulting in miners receiving half as many bitcoin in their reward for solving a block. Scheduled to occur every 210,000 blocks, Bitcoin halvings continue until the maximum supply of 21 million bitcoin has been issued.</p><p>The impact of the next halving on Bitcoin's price remains uncertain. Some analysts predict that the price will follow a similar pattern to previous halvings, rising post-event due to the constrained supply of new coins. However, any price increase will ultimately depend on demand for bitcoin and it should be noted that the market has matured significantly since the 2020 halving, and numerous well-established cryptocurrencies now compete for users.</p><p>Anyone considering whether Bitcoin mining will be profitable in 2023 will likely want to factor the impact of the next Bitcoin halving into their calculus as well.</p><h2>Difficult, But Not Impossible</h2><p>Profitable Bitcoin mining is a challenge, but it’s not impossible. Bitcoin is priced relatively low at the time of writing, yet an Antminer S19 can run profitably at a maximum power cost of $0.10 per kWh. While this rules out areas of the world like the U.K., there are many global locations where power is cheaper. Naturally, renewable sources of energy (solar panels in particular) really help improve profitability and, as the world transitions from oil and gas to renewable sources of energy, it’s hoped that the price of electricity will fall once again.</p><p>Access to cheap electricity, the quickly-evolving nature of Bitcoin and upcoming events like the halving are just some of the many factors to consider when you ask, is Bitcoin mining profitable?</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Keaton Reckard.

According to <a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-May/021694.html">a post on the Bitcoin dev mailing list</a>, Ark offers an alternative scaling approach that allows users to send and receive funds without liquidity constraints, making it easier for recipients to get paid without an onboarding setup. Unlike other Layer 2 solutions like Lightning, Ark does not require the opening and closing of channels, reducing the on-chain footprint significantly.</p><figure>

        <figcaption><a href="https://www.arkpill.me/deep-dive"><em>Image source</em></a></figcaption>
    </figure><p>The protocol operates using virtual UTXOs (vTXOs), which are short-lived notes that expire after four weeks. When a payment is made, existing vTXOs are redeemed, and new ones are created. The anonymity of coin ownership is improved by restricting vTXO values to a range of sats values. Users can acquire vTXOs from others or use a process called lifting, which allows them to lift their on-chain UTXOs off the chain for virtual UTXOs.</p><p>The protocol introduces an intermediary called the Ark Service Provider (ASP), which serves as a liquidity provider, CoinJoin coordinator and Lightning service provider. ASPs create rapid, blinded CoinJoin sessions every five seconds, known as pools, which ensure the atomicity of payment schedules. Recipients can claim their funds through a txlock condition that requires the connector outpoint to remain unchanged.</p><p>Ark's integration with the Lightning Network allows users to attach HTLCs (or PTLCs) to a pool transaction, enabling interoperability between the two protocols. Multiple ASPs can be used to pay Lightning invoices from different vTXO sources using multi-part payments. Payments on Ark are credited every five seconds, allowing users to spend their zero-conf vTXOs immediately without waiting for on-chain confirmations.</p><p>The developer behind Ark highlighted the protocol's potential for future extensions and improvements. A hypothetical data manipulation opcode could disincentivize double-spending, and users could forge an ASP's signature to reclaim their vTXOs in case of a double-spend. Overall, Ark offers a promising solution for efficient and secure off-chain transactions on the Bitcoin network.</p><p>For more information on Ark and its technical details, curious users are encouraged to visit <a href="https://arkpill.me/deep-dive">https://arkpill.me/deep-dive</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MjMxNzYxODMwNTUzMDkz/bitcoin-stack.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk4MTMzMzIzODEyMzE2MjMy/image1.png" height="304" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Neutronpay And Pouch.ph Partner To Offer Affordable Remittances For Canada And Vietnam Using Lightning]]></title><description><![CDATA[Canadians who want to send money back to the Philippines can now leverage the Lightning Network to do so.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/neutronpay-and-pouch-ph-now-offer-lightning-remittances-for-canada-and-vietnam</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/neutronpay-and-pouch-ph-now-offer-lightning-remittances-for-canada-and-vietnam</guid><category><![CDATA[Philippines]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Lightning]]></category><category><![CDATA[Remittances]]></category><category><![CDATA[Canada]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 22 May 2023 17:06:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzMDI2MTUyOTY3NzA5OTE3/global-hyperbitcoinization.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><a href="https://neutronpay.com/">Neutronpay</a>, a digital payment platform based in Canada, has partnered with <a href="https://pouch.ph/">Pouch.ph</a> to offer fast and affordable remittance services for Filipinos living in Canada and Vietnam.

Although Ordinals’ block space usage had been<a href="https://dune.com/queries/2009834/3326390"> trending down</a> since March 23, 2023, the release of<a href="https://arthodl.net/2023/04/05/bugatti-and-asprey-bringing-high-tech-faberge-style-eggs-to-ordinals/"> notable collections</a> and a <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoins-high-fees-create-controversy-and-challenges">burgeoning mania</a> for BRC-20 tokens seems to have reversed that trend. </p><p>Should competition for block space between Ordinals, BRC-20 tokens and purely monetary transactions remain high, so will fees. And, should fees climb sufficiently high, the ghastly shades of the<a href="https://blog.bitmex.com/the-blocksize-war-chapter-1-first-strike/"> blocksize war</a> may rise once more to torment all Bit-kind.</p><h2>The Case Against Ordinals</h2><p>Fees aren't the only flashpoint. While Bitcoin has certainly had its share of negative headlines over the years, the protocol itself has thus far escaped the same level of recrimination. Exchange failures, drug sales, countless scams — these are all things people did <em>with</em> the tech, rather than any intrinsic fault of the tech itself. Not so with, say, Ethereum, where sketchy smart contracts are virtually part of the machine. </p><p>With Ordinals popularizing the integration of Bitcoin's blockchain with all manner of infamous Ethereum innovations (such as NFTs, tokens and, perhaps soon,<a href="https://thebitcoinmanual.com/articles/what-are-brc-721-tokens/"> smart contracts</a>), reputational risk to the Bitcoin protocol grows. How long until a token is issued directly on Bitcoin which passes the<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp"> Howey Test</a> and so falls afoul of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission? </p><p>Further in this regard, Ordinals also greatly lower the barrier to introducing illicit or classified content into Bitcoin's blockchain.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>As for the loss of user funds due to rug pulls, bugs, hacks and takedowns, all of these boxes have already been ticked under Ordinals. Most recently,<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ordinals-finance-has-conducted-a-1m-rug-pull-certik"> Ordinals Finance</a> pulled a $1 million rug, albeit on the Ethereum side of the ledger. Just prior to that,<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/news/coinedition:bd9364062094b:0/"> UniSat</a> fumbled the launch of its BRC-20s marketplace, resulting in costly double-spend attacks and a lengthy market halt. Before <em>that</em>, several major marketplaces bowed to legal pressure from<a href="https://arthodl.net/2023/04/11/magic-eden-market-delists-ape-collections/"> Yuga Labs</a> and delisted ape-related collections. </p><p>Furthermore, all of these "hiccups" occurred against the background of a<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-ordinals-community-debates-fix-after-inscription-validation-bug"> bug</a> discovered within Ordinals' all-important indexing system. Finally — and I hate to say this — further problems of this nature are anticipated. Consider that one of the largest<a href="https://dune.com/domo/ordinals-marketplaces"> marketplaces by users and volume</a>, Ordinals Wallet as well as the significant Ordswap marketplace both keep keys in browser<a href="https://snyk.io/blog/is-localstorage-safe-to-use/"> </a>local storage, according to what I’ve heard on Discord, which <a href="https://snyk.io/blog/is-localstorage-safe-to-use/">runs contrary to recommended security practices</a> (to say the least).</p><p>I believe the above paragraphs summarize the case against Ordinals from the perspective of many Bitcoin Maximalists — among whose ranks I myself numbered, at least until the Ordinals<a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Purity%20Spiral"> purity spiral</a> went helter-skelter. And while these concerns have merit, there's one particular complaint which I believe deserves to go unmentioned; that Ordinals are a scam. </p><p>When willing buyers and willing sellers exchange goods with informational symmetry, without any claims made as to future price appreciation, well, that's the definition of honest business — and that's the current situation within Ordinals marketplaces. Prove me wrong.</p><h2>In Defense Of Ordinals</h2><p>A point in favor of Ordinals is that <a href="https://decrypt.co/125556/bitcoin-stamps-nfts-are-gaining-on-ordinals">it's possible to prune their content from stored blockchain data</a>. Pruning resolves the blockchain file size bloat issue, which is fairly trivial considering that I expect the bloat to be easily outpaced by the growth of affordable data storage. More importantly, pruning ensures that anyone running a full node can opt out of storing any illegal material (which, to be fair, existed on Bitcoin's blockchain long before Ordinals).</p><p>In regards to the reputational and legislative risks to Bitcoin arising from Ordinals content stored on the blockchain, these can be mitigated — but not eliminated — by proper communication. The point must be hammered home (and not just for the sake of Ordinals) that Bitcoin's uncensorable and permissionless structure has certain unavoidable drawbacks which, on balance, are vastly outweighed by its advantages.</p><p>On the technical front, it's possible that post-traumatic stress from the blocksize war is leading some to view Ordinals as a big-blocker-style assault on Bitcoin's base layer... but as an entirely optional Layer 2, Ordinals have far more in common with the Lightning Network than with Bcash and its ilk. Granted, content insertion into witness data is also occurring, but that process is moderated by fees... </p><p>Fees? Lightning? Let's not jump ahead to the resolution of this Ordinals controversy!</p><p>As for the loss of user funds to cyber bandits or technical gremlins, such losses are likely to remain limited due to the relatively small size of the Ordinals economy. As the<a href="https://www.ordinalhub.com/price-tracking?dateRange=All&amp;page=1"> estimated total value</a> of all Ordinals collection at the time of this writing is currently around 1,628 BTC, worth some $45 million, nothing approaching the scale of the infamous fiascos that have plagued crypto is even possible at this stage:</p><figure>

    </figure><p>So much for playing defense. The fact is that Ordinals are attracting new users, developers, artists and companies to the Bitcoin space. This will surely have multiple benefits beyond the immediate boost to the value and prestige of the entire ecosystem. Onboarding more users of all kinds is the surest path to accelerating hyperbitcoinization. And if Bitcoin succeeds, the world will be liberated from the death grip of central banking — but let's put our ruby-quartz visor back on and refocus.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>While most early Bitcoiners got on board due to technical curiosity or ideological motivation, later adoption waves were likely driven by economic factors. Many of these later entrants stuck around because they realized<a href="https://twitter.com/ChadsBitcoin/status/1258854925884362755"> Bitcoin is a revolution disguised as a get-rich-quick scheme</a>. While we await the next bull cycle, Ordinals are attracting a fresh set of users, composed largely of young creatives. </p><p>Should we really turn these hopefuls away, to wander in the shitcoin swamps?</p><h2>The Solution</h2><p>Ordinals have proven the strong demand for Bitcoin NFTs, tokens and smart contracts. Although such things have been tried on Bitcoin in the past, through whatever confluence of factors, the time is now demonstrably ripe for them. A<a href="https://dune.com/dgtl_assets/bitcoin-ordinals-analysis"> quick glance</a> at inscription count over time (currently over five million after about five months) is enough to confirm this. The associated impact on fees has been equally obvious:</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Note that the two previous spikes, around the starts of 2018 and 2021, coincided with the resolution of massive bull markets. From January of this year, the markets have been fairly calm and the latest spike is attributable to Ordinals. This raises the question of how horrifically high fees will get if the current Ordinals volume persists into the climax of another bull cycle... </p><p>In my view, this is the only critical issue presented by Ordinals; a looming problem with the potential to outweigh the benefit of the adoption boost. With <a href="https://decrypt.co/139259/bitcoin-ddos-ordinals-inscriptions-attack">fees hitting the 600-plus sat per virtual byte (vB) nosebleed levels</a> last seen in late 2017 and early 2018, Bitcoin might lose as many (or more) users to other chains as it gains from Ordinals.</p><p>The solution to high fees back in the day was the<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-segwit"> SegWit</a> soft fork, which greatly reduced the size and fees of conforming transactions. SegWit also enabled the launch of the Lightning Network, a layer atop Bitcoin designed to process low-value transactions. One quirk of Bitcoin is its flat fee and data structure, whereby the cost and block space required to send $1 in BTC is equal to those for sending $1 billion in BTC. Offloading low-value transactions to Lightning frees up block space, resulting in lower bitcoin fees. In combination, these two upgrades ensured that when bitcoin pushed to its all-time high in 2021, fees remained reasonable.</p><p><strong>So, why should the solution to high fees arising from Web3 stuff on Bitcoin be any different?</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.rgbfaq.com/">RGB</a>,<a href="https://lightning.engineering/posts/2022-9-28-taro-launch/"> Taro</a>,<a href="https://www.stacks.co/"> Stacks</a> — these are all technologies to shunt Web3 transactions and data from the Bitcoin blockchain and onto Layer 2. While the approach seen in Ordinals and Stamps of writing content directly to the base layer offers unrivaled permanence and immutability, it's also extremely costly. For example, an artist I spoke with recently told me that he spent $3,800 to inscribe a collection. Especially in these tough economic times, that's a lot for a young creative to gamble in an unpredictable market!</p><p>Consider that, as of this writing, 200 of the collections tracked by<a href="https://www.ordinalhub.com/price-tracking?dateRange=All&amp;page=1&amp;sort=volume_btc%3Aasc"> OrdinalHub</a> have seen <em>zero</em> all-time volume, as in no sales at all. This figure barely scratches the surface of market failures. Sorting the 1,000-plus collections on <a href="https://bestinslot.xyz/ordinals/collections/#order=7d_sales_asc&amp;page=35">Best In Slot</a> by inverse weekly sales volume reveals hundreds with zero sales.<a href="https://ordinalswallet.com/collections"> See for yourself</a> how many low-value collections on Ordinals Wallet have had zero volume or sales over the last week. Pending a proper analysis, my intuition is that fewer than one in 100 inscriptions listed on a marketplace will turn a profit.</p><p>The novelty of Ordinals will fade, but the high costs will remain. Given that Layer 2 solutions don't store data on the blockchain, their creation costs will be orders of magnitude lower. High-end collections, like<a href="https://arthodl.net/2023/04/05/bugatti-and-asprey-bringing-high-tech-faberge-style-eggs-to-ordinals/"> Asprey Bugatti Eggs</a>, may still inscribe to Ordinals as the perceived luxury and maximum-permanence option, but the vast majority of creators will opt for the inexpensive alternatives still linked to Bitcoin, even if indirectly.</p><p>Cost isn't the only factor behind the inevitable migration of most users to Layer 2. The size constraints of Bitcoin blocks make bulky content (like high-resolution images or audio, complex code and all but the shortest video clips) unaffordable or even impossible to inscribe. With generative AI making it easy to create high-resolution image content — and soon audio and video content, too — how much longer will the average creator be content to pay a relative fortune to inscribe text and small, static images?</p><h2>Base Layer To Layer 2</h2><p>The way I see things playing out, Ordinals has proven the market demand for Bitcoin-based NFTs, tokens, DeFi, etc. — as unpalatable as some may find that demand. Regardless, the cost and relative slowness of these assets on the base layer should eventually drive most users to Layer 2 solutions, already nearing completion. The base layer will perhaps become the digital equivalent of the Louvre, housing only the most significant works under the tightest security. Layer 2 will host everything else.</p><p>Ordinal antagonists should take note. Twitter screeds denouncing inscribers as attackers for adding monkey JPEGs to the blockchain only incite hilarity and encourage defiance. A $100 or even a $25 inscription fee is a far more effective disincentive, already established and requiring no keyboard bashing. To defuse the looming threat of high fees, the proactive strategy would be to contribute or donate to the development of Layer 2 solutions.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Steven Hay.

This has resulted in questions regarding the network's future and its ability to handle the increasing demand. </p><p>In response to those questions, it can be helpful to consider the intricacies of Bitcoin’s transaction volume through an accounting lens, as the Bitcoin network, at its foundation, is an accounting ledger with its data written to a public chain and recorded forever. Through this lens, we’ll delve into why Bitcoin’s transaction volume matters, how often such surges will occur and whether or not this growth is sustainable.</p><h2>The Accounting Innovation Of Bitcoin</h2><p>As an accounting ledger, Bitcoin represents the first true accounting innovation in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping">more than 700 years</a>, marking a transition from the legacy, stakeholder-controlled, <em>private</em>, double-entry accounting systems to a <em>public</em>, triple-entry system. </p><p>“Triple entry” simply means that two-party transactions (debit and credit) are written to a public, immutable ledger (the third entry). “Public” means that the ledger is accessible at any time by anyone on the Bitcoin network.</p><p>The accounting innovation here is simply the removal of stakeholders (humans) in exchange for machines (aka, servers and nodes) that run difficulty-adjusted proof of work (PoW). Bitcoin uses PoW to substantiate the entries, instead of relying on stakeholders who may be biased or incentivized to commit fraud or manipulate the ledgers. This means that the miners and nodes control the network in an unbiased, free-from-manipulation environment, not humans.</p><p>In contrast, all legacy accounting technologies relied on trusted third parties, known as the “stakeholders.” The fatal problem with a stakeholder-controlled system is that humans are flawed, and the ledgers are subject to human error, fraud, censorship and manipulation.</p><p>Until Bitcoin, every government, every bank, and every corporation on earth has used private, double-entry accounting systems controlled 100% by the stakeholders. This means that the stakeholders can alter the books and records of all of these legacy systems in secret, away from the public eye. In order to catch fraud, corruption or even error, the entire stakeholder-controlled system — including every transaction traced back to its root — would need to be audited. This process is time consuming, complicated and cumbersome, and like all legacy systems, the audits are conducted by humans, further subjecting the audit system to fraud, corruption and error. </p><p>Bitcoin solves this in three ways:</p><ol><li>By turning private ledgers into public ledgers</li><li>By removing stakeholder control and using difficulty-adjusted PoW to record transactions</li><li>By eliminating the need for a human audit as the network self-audits the timechain, every block</li></ol><p>Altogether, this creates the first unalterable ledger in human history.</p><h2>Accounting For The Truth With Bitcoin</h2><p>Accounting can be simply viewed as verifying the truth of the data involved. The role of accounting is to ensure that the data you are being shown is true. And accounting has never been more important in society than it is today, as truth is under constant attack in every arena. All systems rely on accounting, and the massive amount of available information makes discerning the truth difficult.</p><p>Truth is the most important commodity on the planet earth. How do you record the truth, aggregate the truth and then disseminate the truth if all the records are corruptible by humans?</p><p>Because the Bitcoin ledger is public, self-auditing and immutable, it cannot be corrupted or altered by any human. Never before in the history of record keeping could you rely on ledger to be 100% truthful, until the invention of Bitcoin.</p><p>If you are a member of a legacy, stakeholder-dominated business that relies on legacy accounting, and you have been historically able to manipulate the truth via control of the ledgers, a Bitcoin ledger is fatal.</p><p>In terms of who controls the information on ledgers, at the top of the food chain are totalitarian governments that want to control the truth. Bitcoin decimates these systems as the government, as key stakeholders, no longer has control of the information/data. That is why Bitcoin is <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-is-a-trojan-horse-for-freedom">often referred to as a “Trojan horse.”</a> On its face, it's presented as a technology based on money, but diving deeper, Bitcoin represents a new accounting technology that will provide increased freedom to the people within every nations' borders.</p><p>When you give people immutable data that cannot be seized, you give them freedom in the form of property rights, sound/hard money, truth, control and much more.</p><h2>Bitcoin Will Be The Ledger Of Choice For Everything</h2><p>The somewhat abbreviated way of explaining the “why” motivating people to choose Bitcoin to transact on is that the underlying ledger controlling the data is the best ledger system ever invented, free from fraud, control and manipulation, and providing freedom to those who use it. </p><p>Simply put: If you value the data you wish to record, you are incentivized to choose the only ledger in human history that will record it for eternity without being subject to human manipulation.</p><p>If you believe that an immutable unalterable ledger is superior to legacy, alterable, stakeholder ledgers, intuition suggests that all data will eventually be recorded on the Bitcoin network, from wills and trust, to corporate data, to climate data, to vaccine data, to title/ownership data and so on. The list of possibilities is endless. </p><p>All businesses, governments, and banks rely on ledgers. Nearly all industries have made groundbreaking discoveries and inventions since their inception, except for accounting. After 700 years, triple-entry systems have just now been invented (double entry <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping">was invented in earnest in the 1400s</a>), and legacy stakeholder hesitance to accept an analog system moving to a digital, unalterable system should be questioned.</p><h2>Ordinals Are Just The Beginning</h2><p>Ordinals and NFTs are important to some people. The beauty of a free system is that everyone has the option to pursue what has value to them. If you believe they have zero value, you do not have to engage with them, but Bitcoin as a free market will not censor certain transactions because others do not value them. The network will always allow for innovation and free choice. Those who want to pay the appropriate fee can record Ordinals or NFT transactions on the Bitcoin network. The Bitcoin mempool in the future will always have a base layer of transactions waiting for the fees to drop low enough to be written on chain.</p><p>Since all data will want to be recorded on this network, this will not be the first or last time there is a wait to record your transaction. For smaller transactions, there are Layer 2 solutions, such as the Lightning Network, that live on top of Bitcoin and can be used immediately. Ordinals and NFTs all might go away in the future, and the transaction volume might wane, but eventually they will be replaced by other projects that similarly want to utilize this ledger, the cycle will repeat no matter what the product or data is.</p><p>Since the Bitcoin innovation is the removal of the requirement to trust the stakeholders, anyone who is advocating to censor the Bitcoin network's content is inherently anti-Bitcoin or does not understand Bitcoin. Those who seek to exploit control and power over the Bitcoin network are the exact problem that Bitcoin solves for.</p><p>As the world realizes that the only way to preserve truth (i.e., data and information) is on the Bitcoin network, the traffic will increase. This increased traffic creates a robust atmosphere for entrepreneurs to build on top of the Bitcoin network and a variety of products and services will emerge that aggregate content and write to the Bitcoin base layer.</p><p>Bitcoin fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) is spread by those who are challenged or fear this technology — understanding this network is no small task, it takes thousands of hours. Anyone who says they understand Bitcoin after a cursory examination is lying or ignorant. Similarly, transaction fee FUD is generated by people arguing both sides, that there are both too few transactions to support the network as well as too many transactions to support the network. </p><p>The truth is that the network is working as intended, and a full mempool that requires free market discovery to price transactions is unavoidable and thus, intended.</p><p>Accounting is the operating system that runs the world. All systems and information need to be honestly recorded, analyzed and then truthfully distributed in order to make sense of the data. Historically, ledgers have been protected by physical human violence, which means whoever has the monopoly on violence (aka, governments) can alter the records and/or its distribution. </p><p>Recording truth on the Bitcoin ledger is the only way to record data that does not rely on human violence to protect or disseminate it, for the first time in history.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Darin Feinstein.

His recent departure from the bank came shortly after <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/what-happened-at-credit-suisse-and-why-did-it-collapse-7369825">it was purchased by UBS in March</a> as an attempt to keep it from collapsing amid <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/recap-of-last-weeks-banking-contagion-and-bitcoin">existential turmoil</a> for banks around the world. On stage at Bitcoin 2023, Pozsar addressed how U.S. banks have been impacted.</p><p>"This is basically an episode where the large banks are largely insulated from the problems," Pozsar said. "It's basically lessons in not being able to run interest rate risk, not knowing how to make a loan that will be weathering a rising interest rate storm.”</p><p>He described the Federal Reserve’s responses to these banking failures as only addressing “half the problem.”</p><p>“I think it's more like foaming the runway for any of the large banks that might be having problems down the road,” he added.</p><p>Pozsar was interviewed on stage by BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, who pressed him on whether he owns any bitcoin.</p><p>“I don't own any,” Pozsar responded. “I'm observing it. I don't like to dabble in things that I don't understand well.”</p><p>Pozsar outlined his pessimism that bitcoin could ever really serve as money, as his historical research has shown him that money has to have a direct link to a government to endure. As a fundamentally decentralized, peer-to-peer network, Bitcoin could not support money that fits his definition.</p><p>“The one thing I will say about bitcoin is that money, if you will, is something that is purely public or a public-private partnership,” Pozsar explained. “When I look at Bitcoin, it’s a purely-private initiative. It’s clearly lacking a state link. But then again, things are evolving, there are a number of countries that have adopted bitcoin as a legal tender, so things are definitely in flux there.”</p><p>In his writing, Pozsar has underscored the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danrunkevicius/2022/03/10/after-this-war-is-over-money-will-never-be-the-same-what-credit-suisses-shocking-prediction-means-for-bitcoin-and-crypto-prices/?sh=2c32f3776c25">evolving role that Bitcoin is playing around the world as institution-backed money like the U.S. dollar becomes weaker</a>. At Bitcoin 2023, he listed several global market trends, including the rising economic power of China, that are threatening its role as the global reserve currency.</p><p>“There’s a number of changes happening that I think we need to keep an eye on because it’s all going to be at the expense of the dollar’s share of commodity finance, trade finance, share of reserve assets and so on,” Pozsar said.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk4MDkwMzUyMTI3NjQ4OTU4/zoltan-pozsar-bitcoin-2023.jpg"/></item></channel></rss>
