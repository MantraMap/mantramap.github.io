<p>Despite a sluggish start to the week, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-eyes-monster-move-as-new-lawsuit-outcomes-set-ripple-on-path-to-gigantic-win-against-the-sec/">XRP</a>, the native cryptocurrency of the Ripple network, showed signs of recovery towards the weekend, suggesting potential resilience and strength as the year unfolds.</p>



<p>Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum and most cryptocurrencies, XRP has remained relatively strong this month, with price gaining roughly 13% in the past two weeks. This strength has been pointed towards Ripple’s improving fundamentals fueling XRP’s accumulation.</p>



<p>On Saturday, May 27, crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted XRP, noting that crypto whales continue to accumulate the crypto asset. According to Martinez, whales have acquired over 52 million XRP in the past three weeks, totalling approximately $22.9 million.</p>



<p><em>“Whales appear bullish on Ripple! They&#8217;ve purchased over 52 million XRP in the past 3 weeks, worth around $22.9 million,” </em>tweeted Martinez.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="477" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-29-1024x477.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81499" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-29-1024x477.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-29-300x140.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-29-768x358.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-29-1536x715.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-29.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The recent whale activity coincides with the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As ZyCrypto has previously reported, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-ripple-boss-confident-groundbreaking-verdict-is-coming-in-weeks-after-hinman-speech-docs-win/">the resolution</a> of this high-profile case is eagerly anticipated by the XRP Army and the wider crypto community, especially after the recent ruling by Judge Analisa Torres to unseal the controversial Hinman documents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pro-Ripple lawyer Jeremy Hogan recently shared his prediction on the Ripple vs SEC case timeline. Responding to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse&#8217;s recent mention that the case would be resolved &#8216;in weeks&#8217;, Hogan suggested that the final resolution would likely occur by July 2023.</p>



<p><em>“The Judge in the Ripple case has been making major rulings about every 9 weeks (Sept. 29, Dec.19, March 6, May 16). And the only major ruling left is on Summary Judgment. That comes out to mid-July. NOT a prediction. JUST a pattern,” </em>said<em> </em>Hogan.</p>



<p>In addition to the legal battle, Ripple has been actively acquiring companies globally, significantly <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-mulls-making-key-acquisitions-in-crypto-friendly-countries-can-it-boost-xrp-to-1/">boosting XRP&#8217;s liquidity</a>. A notable acquisition has been <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-acquires-crypto-custody-provider-metaco-for-250m-as-xrp-lawsuit-nears-end-game/">Metaco</a>, a Swiss crypto custody provider, in a bid to grow its global footprint. Recently, Ripple also purchased Pantera Capital&#8217;s stake in the centralized exchange Bitstamp, resulting in the blockchain firm <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-buys-shares-in-european-crypto-exchange-bitstamp-massive-xrp-growth-ahead/">obtaining a controlling stake</a>. Last week, Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, revealed that the company has over $1 billion reserved for global acquisitions as part of its ambitious business development plan.</p>



<p>That said, amid these positive developments, analysts predict the cryptocurrency will likely continue exhibiting strength for the next few weeks. On Saturday, crypto analyst &#8220;Dark Defender&#8221; predicted a surge for XRP to $0.50 in the next few days after the price surpassed the $0.4696 resistance level. And while reaching $0.50 may trigger a sell-off, the analyst-maintained confidence in XRP&#8217;s potential to exceed this level and reach $1.3 by August.</p>



<p>At press time, XRP trading is trading at $0.47, up roughly 2% in the past 48 hours.</p>

<p>On May 25th, Checkmate, Lead On-chain Analyst at Glassnode, stated that Bitcoin is at a crucial point that could lead to a significant correction, as several indicators suggest.</p>



<p>Checkmate explained to his Twitter followers that to assess the potential correction, it is important to analyze the behaviour of Short-Term Holders, as they are mostly responsible for significant price movements in BTC.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-several-metrics-indicate-a-potential-correction-in-bitcoin-s-price">Several metrics indicate a potential correction in Bitcoin&#8217;s price</h2>



<p>The Glassnode analyst pointed out that one of the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/key-bitcoin-metric-reaches-crucial-support-level-can-price-pull-a-2021-like-rally/">most important metrics</a> to consider is the Short-Term Holder Realized Price, which is currently being tested around the $26,500 zone. This level should provide strong <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoins-price-outlook-uncertain-as-key-support-level-faces-crucial-test/">psychological support</a>, as losing it could result in a higher drop.</p>



<p>Similarly, Checkmate explained that the STH-SOPR, which indicates the Dominance of Losses of Short-Term Holders, is below 1.0. This means that the losses of Short-Term Holders are mainly generated by local top buyers, which is uncommon and generally creates a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/prepare-this-crypto-analyst-says-the-next-explosive-bitcoin-rally-is-right-around-the-corner/">bullish reaction</a> driven by the fear of missing out on an upward movement (FOMO).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="590" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-30-1024x590.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81510" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-30-1024x590.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-30-300x173.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-30-768x442.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-30.png 1495w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Regarding the Short-Term Holder Profit/Loss Ratio, the metric has reached a state of balance, indicating a possible healthy short-term market cleansing. However, the analyst warned that losing the current values could generate negative sentiment in the short term.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitcoin&#8217;s price could be on the brink of a significant correction</strong></h2>



<p>Lastly, Checkmate highlighted that the STH Profit/Loss momentum tool, designed to detect rapid changes in market trends, is currently at a neutral level. Nevertheless, if it starts to show deterioration, it could be a clear signal of a deeper correction, as has happened on other occasions.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;We must observe these marginal buyers and sellers. On-chain analysis of Short-Term Holders provides precisely this, a view into the most economically active participants right now.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to note that most of the charts the analyst presents use daily timeframes, so it is normal to expect substantial movements of up to $10,000.</p>



<p>Although the indicators provide valuable information to understand the current <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-exchange-inflows-tap-6-year-low-as-investors-take-flight-to-self-custody/">Bitcoin</a> and cryptocurrency landscape, they are not entirely infallible when it comes to trading crypto. Therefore, closely observing key levels and market reactions and conducting thorough research before investing in these assets is essential.</p>

<ul>
<li>Hong Kong is looking to position itself as the Asian crypto hub this year, with plans to permit retail trading.</li>



<li>Experts predict that the PRC will follow suit after Hong Kong sets the ball rolling due to the relationship between both jurisdictions.</li>



<li>The Hong Kong digital asset guideline includes minimum entry level, market caps, and disclosures to ensure transparency and prevent market manipulation.</li>
</ul>



<p>Hong Kong is on its way to regaining its lost status as the crypto hub of South East Asia with a detailed strategy that will potentially spin into China.</p>



<p>As Hong Kong reopens trading to retail investors in June, experts have weighed in on the ripple effect of a successful implementation. The new rules may find their way back into mainland China according to Anne Sophie Cissey, Flowdesk’s Head of Compliance.</p>



<p>China began its <a href="https://zycrypto.com/does-the-market-really-care-about-chinas-anti-crypto-crackdown/">crackdown</a> on cryptocurrencies in 2017, declaring them illegal before specifically attacking firms and shutting down mining operations, citing climate concerns. The country floated its digital currency to rival private digital assets, which it termed “<em>risky and dangerous” </em>to people and the economy.</p>



<p>With Hong Kong being a special administrative jurisdiction controlled by China, this move could be a test bed to introduce digital assets considering its previous harsh stance gradually.</p>



<p>“<em>This has been the city’s traditional role for most of the time after 1997, Hong Kong’s handover to the People’s Republic of China. It is a major development in Chinese thinking since the country’s long-standing ban on digital assets and the start of the ‘one country, two systems’ model</em>,” Ciccey noted.</p>



<p>She also added that China is tactical on the issue due to its authoritarian regime.</p>



<p><em>“Hence allowing Hong Kong to embrace a more crypto-friendly stance towards crypto, from the outside, suggests that Beijing wants to use the territory as a testing ground.&#8221;&nbsp;</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hong-kong-set-to-attract-the-big-players">Hong Kong set&nbsp; to attract the big players&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Top web3 firms are looking to make a return to the region and have shown positive feedback following the rollout of new regulations. The new regulations take effect in June and will include a rigorous new licensing system to protect investors. </p>



<p>Firms are also expected to file periodic disclosures to prevent money laundering and market manipulations. Digital asset exchanges are given the green light to operate, but investors with a portfolio below HK$8 million will have certain restrictions. </p>



<p>Lennix Lai, OKX’s  Chief Compliance Officer, lauded the stance of the government, saying that this is an important milestone in web3 development across the region. </p>



<p>“<em>We welcome SFC&#8217;s official stance and commitment to allowing virtual assets trading by retail investors in Hong Kong. This is an important milestone for Hong Kong&#8217;s virtual assets industry as it continues to grow and develop.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>As Ethereum continues to waver amid a broader downturn in the crypto market, one pundit has ignited a fervent debate with a bold prediction regarding the second-largest crypto asset.</p>



<p>Adam Cochran, a partner at activist venture capital firm CEHV, took to Twitter on Saturday to present a compelling case for the possibility of Ethereum&#8217;s price surging to over $450,000 within the next two decades.</p>



<p>Cochran&#8217;s argument began by urging individuals to view <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ethereum-mints-more-sharks-and-whales-amid-discounted-prices/">Ethereum</a> not as a typical company but as an innovative blockchain-based infrastructure surpassing traditional models&#8217; constraints. To counter those who expressed skepticism regarding the feasibility of a 20-fold increase in ETH, he drew comparisons between Ethereum&#8217;s market value and that of technology giants such as Apple and Amazon.</p>



<p>At the core of Cochran&#8217;s analysis was the immense volume of securities processed, an astonishing $2.5 quadrillion in the previous year alone. The pundit noted that if these securities were handled on the Ethereum blockchain, accompanied by a minimal 0.05% gas fee, it would result in the annual burning of ETH worth $1.25 trillion. He noted that this amount is 5.7 times greater than the current market capitalization. Accordingly, based on that, Cochran envisioned Ethereum&#8217;s potential value soaring to an extraordinary $35 trillion.</p>



<p>However, he went even further by introducing the concept of a compound burning rate. According to him, assuming an annual compound burning rate of 2% or higher over the course of 20 years, each ETH token could reach an astonishing value of $457,081.</p>



<p>“<em>If you assumed it took 20 years to get there and we burn at a compounding rate of 2%+ annual, you get to around $457,081 per ETH. Add in the fact its a yielding asset and you&#8217;re over $500k,”</em> he tweeted.</p>



<p>Notably, while Cochran acknowledged that achieving 100% adoption of Ethereum for global securities settlement within two decades might be unlikely, he expressed belief in the realistic possibility of settling 10% of global securities within the next ten years.</p>



<p><em>“Do I think 10% of global securities can be settled on ETH in the next 10 years? Sure…Do I think Ethereum can also have value markets other than current global securities that would uplift that? Sure,”</em> he added.</p>



<p>That said, Despite Cochran&#8217;s bold projections, they reveal the boundless possibilities within the realm of Ethereum. The cryptocurrency&#8217;s role as a blockchain infrastructure fosters innovation, a trend that is likely to keep the network and, ultimately, price growing.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, regarding recent market movements, Ethereum&#8217;s price exhibited lacklustre movements, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ether-falls-silent-as-ethereum-suffers-2-network-disruptions-within-24-hours/">dropping</a> around 1.17% over the past week. Since May 13, the second largest cryptocurrency has been seesawing between $1,700 and $1,830, a range that needs to be breached for the price to give a definitive direction. At press time, ETH was trading at $1,841, up 0.65% in the past 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap data.</p>

<p>In an unexpected twist of events, hardware wallet maker <a href="https://zycrypto.com/amid-underwhelming-cardano-price-hoskinson-predicts-huge-tvl-boost-as-trezor-suite-adds-support-for-ada/">Trezor</a> has seen an incredible 900% increase in sales, while rival Ledger suffers a serious setback. The increase in Trezor purchases coincides with a major debate over Ledger&#8217;s seed phrase recovery feature.</p>



<p>Users of Ledger, a top producer of hardware wallets, are concerned about the security of their money in light of the recent controversy surrounding the company. Concerns regarding seed phrase storage and the admittance by Ledger that the software can be pushed to release crucial information have raised red flags in the crypto community. Ledger has put a hold on the feature&#8217;s rollout to focus on enhancing transparency and code verifiability in response to these worries. Still, Ledger users appear to have lost faith in the company, which has hurt sales.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Trezor, a reputable rival in the hardware wallet market, has seen a startling 1000% increase in sales. Trezor has attracted a large following of cryptocurrency fans and investors looking for a safer solution to increase the security of their digital assets. Trezor&#8217;s recent sales success has been greatly influenced by its solid reputation for prioritizing customer privacy and security.</p>



<p>The increase in Trezor sales suggests a rising need for secure storage options among cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Investors are becoming increasingly conscious of how crucial it is to protect their digital assets, particularly in light of constant cyber threats and hacking attempts. Trezor&#8217;s popularity among users for its top-notch security measures and easy-to-use interface has boosted its sales figures.</p>



<p>Additionally, the effects of the temporary closure of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange coincided with the most recent spike in Trezor sales. Many traders turned to hardware wallets to escape from FTX&#8217;s technical issues to independently secure their assets.</p>



<p>Trezor&#8217;s increasing sales and Ledger&#8217;s difficulties serve as a reminder of how important security and trust are to the cryptocurrency sector. Users prioritize platforms and products that prioritize the protection of their funds. Hardware wallet producers must uphold the highest levels of security as the market continues to develop if they want to inspire user confidence.</p>



<p>The rise in Trezor sales and the difficulties Ledger is currently experiencing may have far-reaching effects in the future. Trezor&#8217;s success is probably going to push it to the head of the hardware wallet pack, which will raise industry rivalry and spur innovation. Ledger must work hard to repair its reputation and win back its users&#8217; trust.</p>



<p>The value of secure storage options cannot be overstated as cryptocurrency adoption rises. Hardware wallets are essential for protecting digital assets; thus, users should be careful to choose a reliable provider.</p>

<p>In a surprising case that caught the crypto community&#8217;s attention, Sarita, a New York housewife, uncovered her husband&#8217;s hidden <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-at-70000-arthur-hayes-reveals-why-this-price-level-is-unlikely-to-happen-till-2024/">Bitcoin</a> assets during her divorce proceedings.</p>



<p>According to a Saturday report by CNBC, Sarita, who chose to use a pseudonym for her safety, disclosed that she tracked down 12 bitcoins, currently worth close to half a million dollars, in a previously undisclosed crypto wallet owned by her husband after months of investigation and the assistance of a forensic accountant.</p>



<p>As per the report, Sarita, now seeking divorce after a decade in marriage, expressed her shock and feeling of being blindsided by her husband&#8217;s cryptocurrency investment. She admitted that although she had heard of Bitcoin, she had little knowledge about it since they had never discussed it or made investments together.</p>



<p><em>“I know of bitcoin and things like that. I just didn’t know much about it,”</em> she said, adding, “<em>it was never even a thought in my mind, because it’s not like we were discussing it or making investments together…It was definitely a shock.”</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cryptocurrency-tracking-in-divorce-a-nightmare"><strong>Cryptocurrency Tracking in Divorce: A Nightmare</strong></h2>



<p>As more and more people get involved with cryptocurrencies, cases of financial infidelity related to digital assets are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Moreover, experts in divorce law concur that the legal system is struggling to keep pace with the complexities of cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>Notably, tracking down hidden cryptocurrency assets <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cryptocurrency-effect-marriage/">during divorces</a> has led to the emergence of forensic investigators specializing in studying and tracking cryptocurrencies owned by spouses.</p>



<p>In a note to CNBC, divorce attorney Kelly Burris explained that due to the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies, obtaining information through traditional means, such as subpoenas, is often impossible. Instead, forensic analysis of computers or phones is necessary to identify wallet addresses and conduct blockchain analysis.</p>



<p><em>“The thing with cryptocurrency is it’s not regulated by any kind of centralized bank, so usually you can’t subpoena somebody and get documents and information related to somebody’s cryptocurrency holdings,”</em> said Burris.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In divorce cases involving cryptocurrencies, investigators pay close attention to hardware wallets, cold storage methods, and the movement of tokens across various blockchains. However, the increasing practice of &#8220;chain hopping&#8221;, where individuals quickly switch between different blockchains, complicates asset tracking.</p>



<p>Further, the rapid expansion of the cryptocurrency market, and the introduction of privacy tokens, such as Zcash, Dash and Monero, have also made it challenging to conduct forensic investigations since they offer anonymity when conducting transactions. Additionally, some divorcees may also choose to use crypto mixers such as the now-defunct Tornado Cash, making it harder to trace their assets.</p>



<p>That said, as the popularity and complexity of cryptocurrencies continue to grow, it has become clear that the legal system will need to adapt to handle cases involving digital assets effectively. Still, first, clear crypto regulations are needed.</p>

<p>Arthur Hayes, the co-founder and former CEO of BitMEX, has predicted a period of significant volatility for Bitcoin in the coming months before eventually surging to new highs in 2024.</p>



<p>In a Friday, May 26 interview with WhatBitcoinDid host Peter McCormack, Hayes predicted that Bitcoin&#8217;s price will not exceed $70,000 until next year.</p>



<p><em>“We got this halving next year, 2024. I think that&#8217;s going to be a good year. I don&#8217;t think we get up to $70,000 this year. I think next year is when we cross that barrier, and then we get the blow-off top 2025, 2026, and then it&#8217;s Armageddon,” </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yV-zwcFnR3Q&amp;t=1781s&amp;ab_channel=WhatBitcoinDid">said</a> Hayes.</p>



<p>The crypto guru, who disclosed working on Maelstrom, his family office, noted that he considers Bitcoin a serious experiment that has demonstrated success thus far. He also revealed that he <a href="https://zycrypto.com/former-bitmex-ceo-arthur-hayes-on-why-bitcoin-price-has-likely-reached-bottom/">views Bitcoin</a> as a durable form of currency capable of maintaining its purchasing power in terms of energy. Drawing a parallel between the value of Bitcoin and that of oil over time, Hayes suggested that Bitcoin has performed well in preserving its value.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hayes-economic-outlook"><strong>Hayes&#8217; Economic Outlook</strong></h2>



<p>Hayes further recognized the inherent challenges and risks present within the current financial system. He drew attention to the widespread practice of governments printing money to tackle increasing debts, cautioning that this strategy is not sustainable and may potentially lead to a collapse, further exacerbating the challenges Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies face.</p>



<p>“<em>You know governments print a bunch of money, the fed being the most egregious of all of them,</em> and now they&#8217;ve exacerbated the problems…if we print all this money,<em> how do we take it out of the system without causing bad effects,” </em>added Hayes.</p>



<p><em>“They think they&#8217;re so smart that they can time the market,</em> and the market is not going to inflict pain on them,<em> and the market is going to only act in a very linear fashion it&#8217;s not going to,” </em>he went on.<em> </em></p>



<p>Given these concerns, Hayes advised individuals to explore alternative assets outside the traditional financial system. In Particular, he suggested considering investments in <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-bulls-set-eyes-above-30000-as-gold-taps-new-all-time-high/">Bitcoin,</a> gold, real estate, or businesses that generate cash flow, emphasizing the importance of taking action now rather than waiting until it becomes more difficult to access these assets.</p>



<p>Additionally, recognizing that purchasing Bitcoin may pose challenges in certain regions due to regulatory restrictions, he urged individuals to find ways to acquire Bitcoin and, if necessary, consider relocating to places where it is easier to do so.</p>

<p>Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has expressed confidence that the court will make a final determination on the ongoing XRP lawsuit sooner than projected.</p>



<p>During the Redefine Summit 2023 earlier this week, Garlinghouse shed light on <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-sec-may-have-just-bitten-off-more-than-it-can-chew-as-ripple-eyes-very-big-win-in-case/">Ripple&#8217;s determination</a> to fight for clarity and transparency in the cryptocurrency industry, noting that the nearly 3-year legal tussle with the SEC was nearing an end.</p>



<p>&#8220;<em>In terms of where things stand today, I feel very confident that we will see a decision from the courts this year…I would guess in weeks, not months,&#8221;</em> Garlinghouse stated.</p>



<p>Notably, at the recent Dubai Fintech Summit just a week ago, Garlinghouse stated that he anticipates the case will conclude within two to six months.</p>



<p>The CEO’s optimistic statements come following a recent <a href="https://zycrypto.com/groundbreaking-ripple-win-in-xrp-case-looking-likely-as-court-rejects-secs-request-to-keep-hinman-docs-hidden/">ruling</a> in which Judge Analisa Torres denied the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) request to seal internal documents related to William Hinman&#8217;s speech. The speech in question addressed why Ethereum (ETH) was not considered a security. The court ruled that the notes and emails associated with the speech should be made public on June 13, a move Garlinghouse hailed as a &#8220;huge win for transparency&#8221; during the interview.</p>



<p>Despite the ongoing legal battle and the lack of regulatory clarity, Ripple has chosen to stand firm and fight for its interests and the entire crypto industry. Garlinghouse acknowledged the financial toll the lawsuit has taken, stating, &#8220;<em>We&#8217;ve spent a lot of money defending it, and I think what we&#8217;ve called out is that the government of the United States and the SEC particularly is putting politics ahead of smart policy.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Garlinghouse further highlighted the frustration felt by many entrepreneurs in the crypto industry due to actions by the SEC and other government agencies, leading to some relocating their operations overseas. <em>&#8220;Because of that, you are seeing entrepreneurs go overseas. Most of our hiring is not in the US now. Most of our customers are non-US,” </em>he added.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, Pro-Ripple lawyer Jeremy Hogan also expressed his belief in the lawsuit ending soon in a Tuesday, May 23, tweet. According to the lawyer,&nbsp; Judge Analisa Torres is not obligated to wait for the release of redacted documents before making a decision. However, he suggested that she might choose to do so, adding, &#8220;<em>I would not hold my breath until after June 13.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Filed in December 2020 by the SEC, the XRP lawsuit alleges that Ripple executives, including Chris Larsen and Brad Garlinghouse, violated securities laws by selling XRP without proper registration. Conversely, Ripple has continued to contend that XRP is a digital currency and not a security.</p>



<p>With Ripple having <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-whales-amass-nearly-half-a-billion-coins-as-traders-shower-confidence-on-a-ripple-win-in-sec-case/">bagged several wins</a> in court over the past year or so, it remains to be seen whether the ultimate ruling will favour it, which, if so, would be a major win for the entire crypto industry.</p>

<ul>
<li>Web3 lawyer John Deaton discovered a footnote in documents that confirms the SEC discussed the possibilities of XRP not meeting the requirements of the Howey test.</li>



<li>Though the SEC did not comment on the record, Deaton believes the statement confirms what the crypto community has expressed for years.</li>



<li>XRP Army and other digital asset executives share their views on the lingering court case stating how it would shape regulation in the industry.</li>
</ul>



<p>The legal tussle between Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) takes a new turn as web3 lawyers and digital asset users scrutinize a new revelation concerning the case. </p>



<p>Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton has <a href="https://twitter.com/johnedeaton1/status/1660301659887616000?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">stated</a> that a small footnote that he discovered in Ripple’s brief could play a key role in determining the merits of the case. On May 22, Deaton explained on Twitter that the footnote confirmed a conversation between staff of the SEC concerning Ripple “<em>prior to the Hinman speech.”</em></p>



<p>“<em>There are reasonable grounds to conclude that XRP does not satisfy all elements of the Howey Analysis and is therefore not a ‘security’ for purposes of the federal securities laws,” </em>the footnote reads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is a potential game changer as internal debates within the Commission on XRP not being a security could switch the dynamics and narrative. The US regulator charged Ripple alongside two of its executives Brad Garlinghouse and Christian Larsen for issuing $1.3 billion in “unregistered securities.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ripple has consistently denied these claims insisting that it does not meet up the requirements for the Howey Test, the age-long test used by regulators to determine if assets fall under securities. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Deaton stated that this proves “<em>what we have said for years.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>“Everything that an XRP holder has been shouting for the past couple of years, it has absolutely confirmed that XRP has been discussed,” </em>he added.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-speculations-as-legal-tussle-nears-end"><strong>More speculations as legal tussle nears end</strong></h2>



<p>New developments in the case including the recent ruling on the Hinnan document have been debated in crypto circles. Deaton believes that there are parts that will hinder Ripple’s shot at victory, although it still looks promising.</p>



<p>“<em>I think the chances of Ripple getting a complete victory are much slimmer after reading this than I felt before. I still don’t think the SEC is getting a complete victory either,”  </em>he added. </p>



<p>Deaton explained that Judge Torres might decide to fine the company for its early sale of XRP and other transactions but not on subsequent sales as that does not amount to securities. Similarly, Marc Fagel, a former SEC security lawyer added that while secondary markets were helpful to prove the Commission’s case, “<em>Torres would be overstepping to make a ruling on secondary sales.” </em></p>

<ul>
<li>Spot gold rose 0.9% to a new record high of $2,080.72 an ounce on Wednesday following an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Market commentators criticize the continuous decision of the Feds to hike interest rates predicting a future stall in hikes.</li>
</ul>



<p>Bitcoin (BTC) now trades above $26,000 after the Feds vote to raise the interest rate to the highest point in 16 years but signals a pause for future hikes. </p>



<p>BTC trades hands at $26,737 at the time of writing after falling on May 2. The slight rally comes after the Federal Reserve hikes interest rates by another 25 points amid significant economic turmoil in the banking sector.</p>



<p>At the start of the week, BTC price crawled in anticipation of the rate hike but witnessed the market leader reclaiming $26k, a much-needed boost as bulls locked their eyes on the $30,000 resistance level. </p>



<p>Gold prices hit new highs following the hike by the Feds, benefiting from the bank&#8217;s decision to implement stringing measures for future hikes. An ounce of gold now trades at $2,080 as investors seek a safe haven in the precious metal.</p>



<p>The Federal Reserves leaning toward a pause in rate hikes after a streak of 10 previous hikes also fueled a surge in the digital asset market. The Feds will now adopt a more “<em>data-driven and meeting-by-meeting approach” </em>for future decisions.</p>



<p>Financial analysts at ING believe that a pause is here to stay, given worsening economic situations and <em>‘bank stresses.’</em></p>



<p>“<em>With lending conditions rapidly tightening in the wake of recent bank stresses, we think this will mark the peak for interest rates with recessionary forces set to prompt interest rate cuts later this year.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-experts-mount-pressure-on-feds">Experts mount pressure on Feds</h2>



<p>Financial executives have criticized the approach of the Federal Reserve in handling inflation, pointing to the collapse of regional banks as more continue to struggle amid higher interest rates for consumers. Michael van de Poppe, Eight’s CEO, lashed out at the Federal Reserve. </p>



<p>“<em>The biggest joke is the fact that Jerome Powell says that the banking system has improved and is healthy, sound, and resilient. It’s the weakest it has ever been, and another few banks have been falling apart after the market. This was the last hike,” </em>he added.</p>



<p>Former CEO of BitMEX Arthur Hayes says the decisions of the Feds are now based on politics rather than rational decisions.</p>



<p>“<em>You never know what is the trigger that causes Yellen or Powell to cave and bail everyone out. It’s all politics now, and politics is more about power than rational decisions,” </em>he tweeted.</p>

<p>Prominent blockchain-based payment solutions company, Ripple, is contemplating making strategic acquisitions in crypto-friendly countries in a bid to expand its business model.</p>



<p>Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse unveiled this information during a live interview at last week&#8217;s Dubai Fintech Summit. In his remarks, the Ripple boss noted that Ripple&#8217;s aspirations <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-expands-into-the-institutional-crypto-custody-market-following-250-million-acquisition-of-metaco/">go beyond</a> its existing emphasis on cross-border payments for businesses and encompass various other aspects of the blockchain technology sector.</p>



<p><em>“What I think will be next is certainly something Ripple thinks about. We started with enterprise-based cross-border payments. We talked about there being four primitive pieces to blockchain-based technologies; liquidity, compliance, custody and tokenization. Ripple aspires to be more than just that…I think you’d expect that we will expand into some of those other areas either organically or through acquisitions,”</em> said Garlinghouse.</p>



<p>The CEO then emphasized the significance of operating in countries that support blockchain technologies, citing the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-debuts-first-ever-in-market-on-demand-liquidity-odl-deployment-in-the-middle-east/">United Arab Emirates (UAE)</a> and Switzerland as prime examples of nations that offer an encouraging environment for entrepreneurs in the crypto space.</p>



<p><em>“I think we will look at making acquisitions in markets that are friendly to these technologies,” </em>he said, adding <em>“In the previous panel, you had representations from UAE, Switzerland. These are countries that are providing the clarity for entrepreneurs to invest and that allows a company like Ripple that is larger.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Furthermore, to back his statements, Garlinghouse disclosed that Ripple had over $1 billion in cash reserves positioned to be allocated towards the said strategic acquisitions.</p>



<p><em>“We have more than $1 billion of cash on our balance sheet. We want to deploy that to grow both organically and also inorganically through acquisition,” </em>he went on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Garlinghouse&#8217;s remarks came amid heightened concerns over the regulatory environment in the United States. During the interview, he expressed his frustration at the US, stating that the country is falling behind significantly due to the prioritization of politics over policy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to him, investment and growth potential in blockchain technologies risked being pursued outside the United States of America due to the country’s apparent anti-crypto ideologies.</p>



<p>He went on to state that Ripple expects to spend approximately $200 million defending itself against the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-sec-may-have-just-bitten-off-more-than-it-can-chew-as-ripple-eyes-very-big-win-in-case/">ongoing lawsuit</a> with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), asserting that the case lacks a solid foundation.</p>



<p>That said, despite the difficulties encountered in the United States, Ripple&#8217;s ambitions for expansion, which include the possibility of acquiring companies in crypto-friendly regions, have the potential to establish the company as a frontrunner in the global blockchain industry.</p>



<p>This strategic move would boost the utilization of Ripple&#8217;s ecosystem and ultimately drive the value of XRP towards the coveted $1 price level. At press time, the cryptocurrency was trading at $0.4672, up 3.39% in the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>In a May 18, 2023 press release, the New York Fed and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) published the results of a research study, known as Project Cedar Phase II x Ubin+.</p>



<p>Project Cedar is a Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s New York Innovation Center initiative that seeks to develop a technical framework for a theoretical wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC) and contribute to the CBDCs dialogue.</p>



<p>Phase I of Project Cedar revealed that using a wholesale CBDC to facilitate blockchain technology transactions could improve the speed and safety of wholesale cross-border payments.</p>



<p>Ubin+ is a MAS initiative to improve the efficiency of cross-border settlement using distributed ledger technology (DLT) and non-DLT financial networks.</p>



<p>The collaboration to investigate whether wholesale central bank digital currencies (wCBDCs) could improve the efficiency of cross-border, multi-currency payments was announced by the New York Fed and the MAS in November 2022.</p>



<p>Project Cedar Phase II x Ubin+ examined whether DLT could improve the efficiency of cross-border wholesale payments and settlements involving multiple currencies.</p>



<p>As stated by the released Project Cedar Phase II x Ubin+ report, the study was aimed at contributing to the ongoing innovation in the financial sector and not to advance any specific policy outcome. Neither was the study intended to signal any imminent decisions about the appropriateness of issuing a CBDC nor indicating how one would be designed.</p>



<p>The hypotheses tested in the study aimed to establish whether wholesale CBDC systems developed using DLT could be technically interoperable with other payment systems across different jurisdictions, could facilitate cross-border payments across illiquid currency corridors, or could shorten the processing time of cross-border, cross-currency payments initiated in different jurisdictions.</p>



<p>Project Cedar Phase II x Ubin+ has shown that payments can be safely made across multiple ledgers without a central clearing authority or the establishment of a shared central network. The results also showed that simulated payments could be settled atomically, in near real-time, addressing concerns of counterparty risks.</p>



<p>Project Cedar Phase II x Ubin+ also demonstrated that DLT could support enhancements to cross-border multi-currency payments and settlements relating to network interoperability and autonomy, settlement, and speed. The study noted that alternative technical designs other than DLT may also provide viable solutions.</p>



<p>“Cross-border payments are a major railway for facilitating the functioning of the global economy,” said Michelle Neal, New York Fed’s Head of the Markets Group.</p>



<p>Areas for future experimentation and analysis identified by the study include the viability of the network scalability, the involvement of additional currencies supported by their corresponding central bank ledgers, and privacy limitations and liquidity optimization.</p>

<p>According to a May 23, 2023 media release, the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) issued global recommendations to jurisdictions on the regulation of crypto and digital asset markets. IOSCO has requested comments on its recommendations through public consultation by July 31, 2023.</p>



<p>‘Retail access, suitability, and distribution’ of crypto assets is one of the key areas covered by IOSCO’s recommendations. IOSCO proposed that regulators should require crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) to operate in a manner consistent with its standards regarding interactions and dealings with retail clients.</p>



<p>This includes assessing the appropriateness and/or suitability of particular crypto-asset products and services offered to each retail client. In developing new frameworks for crypto and digital asset markets, regulators should consider imposing requirements related to suitability/ appropriateness assessments.</p>



<p>Client Suitability Assessment enables CASPs to profile potential clients to choose the best investments aligned to their objectives, risk tolerance, preferences, experiences, specific needs and circumstances, among other factors.</p>



<p>As per IOSCO recommendations, If CSAPs use suitability assessments, regulators should require that the assessments are robust enough not to give clients the impression that they fully understand the operations and the related risks of crypto asset markets.</p>



<p>IOSCO further proposes that where a prospective client does not demonstrate sufficient knowledge, the CASP should not permit that client to trade crypto assets.</p>



<p>On the retail distribution of crypto-assets, IOSCO has requested public feedback on what other safeguards should be adopted, whether regulators should take steps, and to what extent to restrict advertisements and endorsements promoting crypto-assets.</p>



<p>Following the crypto market bankruptcies in 2022 and events surrounding the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange, the technical committee of IOSCO published a consultation report in February 2023 on the suitability requirements for complex financial products.</p>



<p>The report set out proposed principles relating to customer protection, including suitability and disclosure obligations relating to the distribution of complex financial products to retail and non-retail customers by intermediaries.</p>



<p>Following the issuance of its recommendations, IOSCO has requested jurisdictions to review them against their current regulatory frameworks to ensure compliance with its standards and to fix any gaps as soon as possible. IOSCO aims to finalize its recommendations by the end of the year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an April 2023 media release, IOSCO published its work program for 2023-24. The work program called for IOSCO to maintain the momentum from its July 2022 crypto-asset roadmap and to assess and respond to the risks associated with crypto-asset market activities and decentralized finance.</p>

<p>Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has expressed confidence in Cardano making substantial strides in its mission to create a truly decentralized and inclusive blockchain ecosystem.</p>



<p>In a Thursday, May 25 video on his YouTube channel, Hoskinson provided an update on the project&#8217;s progress and outlined the significant developments that will contribute to the platform&#8217;s unrivalled decentralization in the cryptocurrency space.</p>



<p>First, Hoskinson highlighted CIP 1694, an important project which aims to bring a new way of governing <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-ada-staking-value-surpasses-400-million-ada-reaching-161-million-in-tvl/">Cardano</a>. Currently, most major decisions on how things are done on the network are decided by the Cardano Foundation and a small group of people. However, according to Hoskinson, with CIP 1694, more people from the community will be able to have a say and be involved in making decisions.</p>



<p><em>“You should have a say, not people you&#8217;ve never met not people that aren&#8217;t accountable to you and not people who don&#8217;t have your best interest at heart and I&#8217;d like to believe we can get there. That&#8217;s why we built Cardano,”</em> said Hoskinson.</p>



<p>He further mentioned that the team behind this project was working hard to build and test it on node 8.0, adding that they plan to release node 8.1 soon.</p>



<p>To further encourage community involvement, Charles Hoskinson announced the launch of a grant and Request for Proposal (RFP) program. According to him, these initiatives will provide interested individuals and organizations opportunities to contribute to the Cardano ecosystem by developing tools, infrastructure, and voting accountability mechanisms. He noted that these programs&#8217; details will be unveiled in June and July.</p>



<p>In addition, the crypto guru revealed that Cardano is collaborating with the University of Edinburgh&#8217;s decentralization index lab to measure the project&#8217;s level of decentralization compared to other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This collaboration aims to showcase Cardano&#8217;s significant progress in decentralization, aligning with the project&#8217;s primary goal of building decentralized protocols.</p>



<p>He also mentioned various other <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardanos-explosive-network-developments-fuel-speculation-for-1-ada-price-milestone/">ongoing projects</a> within the Cardano ecosystem. These include advancements in peer-to-peer mechanics, signature support, and the development of the Hydra open-source program. According to him, these developments further contribute to Cardano&#8217;s journey towards unrivalled decentralization.</p>



<p><em>&nbsp;“My belief is that we&#8217;ll actually be substantially more decentralized than all cryptocurrencies on Market which is one of the primary goals of these types of protocols,”</em> he added.</p>



<p>Notably, Charles Hoskinson once again stressed the significance of focusing on moving forward even when facing criticism from others in the industry. That said, as Cardano prepares to enter the age of Voltaire, the network can anticipate a surge of projects and people joining, which will positively impact its overall growth and that of ADA, its native token.</p>
