<p>On-chain data shows that Tamadoge (TAMA), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Cosmos (ATOM) holders are flocking to Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) by the masses. But why did this newcomer in the crypto space draw their attention? Moreso, why do analysts predict that ORBN, still in the second stage of its presale, will surge by over 6000% to $0.24 per coin before the end of the year?</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s9">Why Whales are Buying Up Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) Presale Tokens</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) piqued the interest of many crypto whales and smaller cryptocurrency investors over the last couple of weeks, resulting in a sizable 525% spike. The Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) project is set to totally revolutionize the crowdfunding and venture capital markets through the use of fractionalized NFTs. </p>
<p>Startups looking to raise capital on the platform can mint and issue these equity-backed, fractionalized NFTs, available for purchase from as low as $1. This not only allows everyday investors to break into the venture capital industry, but also means startups can raise funds quickly and more efficiently than is possible through traditional fundraising routes.</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) will also use a &lsquo;&rsquo;Fill-or-Kill&rsquo;&rsquo; mechanism. This mechanism ensures investors are always refunded if a start-up doesn&rsquo;t reach its funding goal within a pre-agreed timeframe. This ensures investors have peace of mind knowing that they will not be penalized for a startup failing to reach its funding goal, while still keeping their investment. The mechanism is coded into the smart contract of the project which is fully audited by Solid Proof.</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN)&rsquo;s tokenomics are looking solid as well. Already 70 million tokens have been sold and the project is in the second stage of its pre-sale. The team&rsquo;s tokens are locked for a year and can then only be released quarterly whilst the liquidity pool of the project is locked for 10 years, ensuring no rug pull can take place whatsoever. ORBN holders also receive benefits ranging from staking bonuses to project governance rights, and more.</p>
<p>Impressively, ORBN has seen immense predictions for its performance into 2023. Analysts forecast that ORBN will see a colossal 6000% increase from its initial starting price of $0.004. This would bring the price to $0.24, a prospect that has frenzied investors marketwide. ORBN is currently trading at $0.021 in its second stage of presale.</p>

<p class="s9">Tamadoge (TAMA) is Underperforming </p>
<p>Although Tamadoge (TAMA) was supposed to be our gateway token to the Tameverse, where we should be able to mint, breed, and battle with our Tamadoge pets, Tamadoge is down over 90% from its all-time high and experts don&rsquo;t see the token recovering any time soon. In search for better yields, many Tamadoge investors have bought in the Orbeon Protocol presale.</p>
<p>Tamadoge has therefore faced scrutiny from investors in face of its dropping value, with many suggesting that Tamadoge lacks any major utility outside of being a meme token.</p>
<p class="s9">Shiba Inu (SHIB) Holders are Looking for Better Gains</p>
<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB) is just a meme coin and has no utility compared to Tamadoge and it seems like the glory days are over for Shiba Inu. Shiba Inu is in the same state as (TAMA) currently, being down over 90% from its ATH. Analysts expect that Shiba Inu (SHIB) might go 50x in the next bull run though, but until that time, crypto investors are searching for less speculative tokens, as Shiba Inu has been criticized as being primarily driven by hype instead of real utility. </p>
<p>As such, Shiba Inu&rsquo;s current price rests at $0.000009, and more concerningly, Shiba Inu&rsquo;s 24 hour trading volume is down by over 25% at time of press.</p>
<p class="s9">Cosmos (ATOM) - No Blockchain 3.0 After All?</p>
<p>Dubbed Blockchain 3.0, Cosmos (ATOM) had the goal to connect multiple blockchains and allow for seamless interoperability. However, with many other cryptocurrency projects offering exactly the same function, such as Ethereum&rsquo;s ERC-20 and Binance&rsquo;s BEP20 for example, it doesn&rsquo;t really seem Cosmos (ATOM) is needed anyway. Investors are slowly getting hold of this, on-chain data shows Cosmos holders are slowly but steadily allocating their capital elsewhere. </p>
<p>To make matters worse for Cosmos, its recent tokenomics proposal for Cosmos (ATOM) 2.0 was rejected. For many investors the failure of Cosmos&rsquo; proposal has come as a final nail in the coffin, as the Cosmos (ATOM) community voted against the new tokenomics framework put forward by Cosmos&rsquo; development team.</p>
