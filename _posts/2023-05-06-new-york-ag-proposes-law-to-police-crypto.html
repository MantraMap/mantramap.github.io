<p>New York Attorney General Letitia James proposed legislation to grant her office greater authority to regulate the cryptocurrency industry. </p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal reports (WSJ) that New York Attorney General Letitia James proposed a new state law to tighten the rules governing crypto firms. James claims additional measures must be taken as the industry suffers from &ldquo;rampant fraud and dysfunction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The proposed legislation, dubbed Crypto Regulation, Protection, Transparency, and Oversight (CRPTO), introduces a rule in which New York requires independent audits of cryptocurrency exchanges and prohibits people from owning both brokerages and tokens in an effort to prevent conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>James explains that her proposal would be &ldquo;the strongest and most comprehensive set of regulations on cryptocurrency in the nation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The proposal further requires crypto platforms to reimburse customers who have fallen victim to fraud and would strengthen the New York State Department of Financial Services&rsquo; authority to regulate digital assets. To this end, Attorney General James said:</p>

<p>Millions of investors have lost hundreds of billions in the value of their cryptocurrency investments because of rampant fraud, including market manipulation, hacking, and opaque business practices.</p>

<p>Bloomberg reports, CRPTO, if adopted by state legislators, would also prevent crypto brokers and marketplaces from trading in their accounts and would ban brokers from borrowing and lending customer assets.</p>
<p>James said in a statement:</p>

<p>Rampant fraud and dysfunction have become the hallmarks of cryptocurrency, and it is time to bring law and order to the multi-billion-dollar industry. New York investors should have the peace of mind that there are safeguards in place to protect them and their money.</p>

<p>As an elected official, James seeks jurisdiction to enforce crypto firms&rsquo; violations of the law, issue subpoenas, and impose civil penalties of $10,000 per violation for every individual or $100,000 per violation for each crypto firm, according to the WSJ.</p>
<p>The AG also seeks authority to shutter businesses that engage in alleged fraud and illegality.</p>
