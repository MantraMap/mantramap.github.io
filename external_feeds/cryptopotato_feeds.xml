			            <description><![CDATA[Is a SHIB rally in the making? Voyager has sold out its entire SHIB stash, while lead developer is expected to come up with a major announcement today.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB) is an explosive cryptocurrency known for its sudden and unexpected rallies. Throughout the past seven days, it&#8217;s up 13.2%, making it one of the best-performing altcoins from the top 20 by means of total market capitalization.</p>
<p>However, there&#8217;s interesting data surfacing, indicating that SHIB&#8217;s price action has actually been compressed by tremendous selling coming from an institutional market participant.</p>
<h2>Is a SHIB Rally Incoming?</h2>
<p>Data from the popular on-chain analytics resource <em>Lookonchain </em><a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1691272802077429761" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">revealed</a> that Voyager has been selling a considerable number of SHIB tokens throughout the past 4 days.</p>
<p>The asset manager, which is currently going through a bankruptcy procedure, sold a whopping 1.4 <em>trillion </em>SHIB worth around $14.4 million.</p>
<p>This has likely suppressed the price from going higher. A couple of days ago, <em>CryptoPotato </em><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/voyager-reportedly-moved-5-5m-of-eth-and-shib-to-coinbase-amid-bankruptcy-procedures/" data-wpel-link="internal">reported</a> that Voyager moved $2.7 million worth of SHIB to Coinbase. It turns out that the reason was obvious.</p>
<p>The good news is that <em>Lookonchain </em>reported that Voyager has no more SHIB to sell. If the cryptocurrency continues its impressive performance from the past seven days, this might mean that more gains are in sight.</p>
<h2>Good News Coming?</h2>
<p>SHIB proponents are also expecting developments in its broader ecosystem. A few days ago, the lead developer Shytoshi Kusama <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/will-shiba-inus-leash-skyrocket-this-week-lead-developer-teases-big-updates-heres-when/" data-wpel-link="internal">teased</a> a new utility for its LEASH token.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Shiba Inu&#8217;s marketing strategist also pushed some updates, stating that later in the day, Kusama will be &#8220;giving a presentation that you won&#8217;t want to miss.&#8221;</p>
<figure id="attachment_266470" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-266470" style="width: 551px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shib_img_1.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-266470" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shib_img_1.jpg" alt="shib_img_1" width="551" height="344" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shib_img_1.jpg 551w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shib_img_1-300x187.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shib_img_1-50x31.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 551px) 100vw, 551px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-266470" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Twitter</figcaption></figure>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that the recent developments have also <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/this-new-shiba-inu-whale-adds-48-million-worth-of-shib-ahead-of-developments/" data-wpel-link="internal">attracted</a> a brand new whale to the ecosystem. Someone bought a whopping $48 million worth of SHIB just a couple of days ago. Could they be waiting for something?</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[According to newly published documents, SBF used other FTX C-Suite members to bypass donation limits.
]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the 14th of August, the prosecution in SBF’s ongoing court case produced the longest and most explicit list of charges so far.</p>
<p>The document is 70 pages long and names legal precedents for most of the charges brought against him. However, special attention is given to the accusation of illegal political campaign contributions.</p>
<p>It wasn’t too long ago that Bankman-Fried was requesting the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sbf-to-enter-not-guilty-plea-to-campaign-financing-and-china-bribery-charges-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">dismissal</a> of the contribution charge, among others. Unfortunately for the defense, the document shows that the prosecution plans to revive the charges based on new evidence garnered during the discovery period.</p>
<h2>Things Sam Is Freaking Out About</h2>
<p>A highly important part of the prosecution’s strategy is the use of Caroline Ellison’s personal notes and archives, which include a list named “Things Sam Is Freaking Out About,” as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/14/technology/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-prosecutors.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">reported</a> by the New York Times.</p>
<p>These archives were virulently attacked by the defense, who labeled them as hearsay. However, the prosecution argues that Ellison’s notes are admissible evidence. In their opinion, the notes were not organized systematically due to any personal quirk. Instead, they were used to help keep track of the FTX C-suite’s off-the-books dealings, making her notes more akin to a secret ledger than a personal diary.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Ellison’s personal notes and to-do lists include entries such as a list titled “Things Sam is Freaking Out About,” which delineates Ellison’s understanding, from conversations with the defendant, of what remained the defendant’s top business concerns, such as Alameda’s trading hedges, bad press about the relationship between Alameda and FTX, and fundraising. […]</p>
<p>Keeping track of Alameda’s finances and objectives clearly constitutes a statement “designed to promote or facilitate achievement of the goals of [the] conspiracy.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Breach of Campaign Donation Law</h2>
<p>The 70-page document also outlines the prosecution’s intent to use text messages to and from members of FTX’s C-Suite as evidence of a breach of political campaign donation law.</p>
<p>This accusation primarily centers on using Nishad Singh and Ryan Salame to <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/elections-overview/biggest-donors" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">donate</a> funds to both sides of Congress on behalf of SBF.</p>
<p>Among the text messages cited as evidence is one sent by Salame to a relative of his, stating that SBF was donating to “weed out anti-crypto dems for pro-crypto dems and anti-crypto repubs for pro-crypto repubs” and stating that SBF would route money through him to erase that republican side.</p>
<p>However, Ryan Salame – who is facing his own set of <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/former-ftx-exec-under-investigation-for-possible-violations-of-campaign-finance-law-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">accusations</a> regarding violations of campaign finance law – will not be available as a witness in the case against Sam Bankman-Fried, choosing to plead the 5th amendment instead in a bid to not incriminate himself.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">From the US government&#8217;s motion in limine in the Sam Bankman-Fried criminal trial: &#8220;[Ryan] Salame is unavailable as a witness&#8230; Salame’s attorney has represented that if subpoenaed, Salame would invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.&#8221; <a href="https://t.co/NrB5d6PJDH" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/NrB5d6PJDH</a></p>
<p>— Molly White (@molly0xFFF) <a href="https://twitter.com/molly0xFFF/status/1691240264923275265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">August 15, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Over $24 million were donated by Ryan Salame to representatives of the Republican Party – and the accusations seem to indicate that none of it was out of his own pocket.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Ripple's XRP has been subjected to multiple discussions and its potential price targets during the next bull market are undoubtedly amongst the more exciting.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>XRP has been in the news lately after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed an interlocutory brief signaling its intention to appeal a recent ruling by Judge Analisa Torres.</p>
<p>The ruling found that XRP may not be <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-xrp-cto-david-schwartz-breaks-down-howey-test-following-sec-appeal/" data-wpel-link="internal">considered</a> a security when sold on the secondary market.</p>
<p>The SEC’s notice of appeal has <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-price-sinks-4-as-uncertainty-ramps-up-but-xrp20-nears-2-million-presale-raise/" data-wpel-link="internal">created</a> uncertainty among XRP investors, triggering a selling pressure that has shaved more than 10% off the coin’s price in the last 14 days.</p>
<p>However, as the crypto market slowly reshapes in readiness for the next bull run, can XRP overcome its current lethargy? And if it can, how high can it go? Well, we took it to no other than ChatGPT to get the answer.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/xrp_bull_market_cover.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266455" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/xrp_bull_market_cover.jpg" alt="xrp_bull_market_cover" width="1201" height="720" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/xrp_bull_market_cover.jpg 1201w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/xrp_bull_market_cover-300x180.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/xrp_bull_market_cover-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/xrp_bull_market_cover-768x460.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/xrp_bull_market_cover-50x30.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1201px) 100vw, 1201px" /></a></p>
<h2>XRP During the Next Bull Market</h2>
<p>While no crystal ball can predict with absolute certainty how XRP will do in the next bull run, certain factors will be central to any potential price rise the coin may make.</p>
<p>Market sentiment is an important price driver for crypto assets. A positive outlook may lead to increased interest and greater adoption, which should translate into higher prices in the market for XRP.</p>
<p>If the SEC were to fail in its appeal, as the pro-crypto lawyer John Deaton has so bullishly <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/pro-xrp-lawyer-willing-to-bet-big-on-ripple-v-sec-case-appeal/" data-wpel-link="internal">predicted</a>, one could expect a ripple effect of positive sentiment around the coin, which could boost its price significantly.</p>
<p>The overall condition of the broader crypto market will also play a part in determining the price of XRP. Most cryptocurrencies will ride the wave if the bull run is marketwide. For instance, many coins hit all-time highs during the last crypto bull run between mid-2020 and late 2021.</p>
<h2>What Else Will Determine the XRP Price?</h2>
<p>Furthermore, if the bull run coincided with XRP unveiling new technological advances or use cases, there’s little doubt it will reflect handsomely in its market price.</p>
<p>Regulatory clarity around crypto, particularly XRP, would also significantly boost its price. Recently, former SEC official John Reed Stark insinuated that a Republican victory in the forthcoming US presidential elections could lead to more crypto-friendly policies and greater regulatory clarity.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Will the SEC Approve Any Of The Recent Bitcoin Spot ETF Applications?</p>
<p>People often ask for my opinion on whether the SEC will approve any of the recent spate of bitcoin spot ETF applications, which is an interesting and important question.</p>
<p>My take is that the current SEC will… <a href="https://t.co/lPXebl03Y4" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/lPXebl03Y4</a></p>
<p>— John Reed Stark (@JohnReedStark) <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnReedStark/status/1690707913789112320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">August 13, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In the last bull run, XRP gained as much as 710% in 6 months, and if history repeats itself, it is not farfetched to imagine it could make similar gains as long as most of the factors explained above are in its favor. Going by its current price of $0.62, a 700% rise would hypothetically place XRP’s value at nearly $5. Of course, none of this is certain, as there are usually too many unknown variables that can affect a cryptocurrency’s price, and past performance is not an indicator of future performance.</p>
<p>Also, none of the above is to be construed as any form of financial advice. Remember that the cryptocurrency market is subjected to high volatility, and there&#8217;s a high chance of losing your investment. Never risk more than you&#8217;re comfortable losing, and always do your research or consult a professional before making an investment.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Bitcoin and the altcoins are still in a state of deep slumber as investor activity on-chain plunges to a new all-time low.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Aug. 14, on-chain analytics provider Glassnode published its weekly market update, but there wasn’t much to report.</p>
<p>Markets have hardly moved over the past week, and volatility is at record lows. The Bitcoin market has reached a stage of “extreme apathy and exhaustion,” it said before adding that <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-derivatives-volumes-drop-to-new-lows-amid-volatility-crush/" data-wpel-link="internal">volatility</a> and several key on-chain indicators are reaching all-time-low readings.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Sluggish Bitcoin Market Inflows</h2>
<p>Investors are reaching an all-time low in “willingness to spend coins on-chain,” the report noted.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The conditions of the Bitcoin market continue to resemble the bear market hangover seen in prior cycles, with an outsized wealth held by long-term high conviction holders.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The Realized Cap metric represents the cumulative capital inflow since inception. More than $16 billion in value has flowed into Bitcoin so far this year, but the growth is very shallow compared to previous cycles.</p>
<p>Moreover, the sluggish inflows could be compounded by the fact a large majority of the Bitcoin market is still underwater on their holdings, it said. This could create further resistance throughout the recovery.</p>
<p>It added that the supply held by long-term holders continues to increase, hitting a peak of 14.6 million BTC. Conversely, short-term holder supply has fallen to a multi-year low of 2.56 million BTC, it added.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Overall, this suggests that conviction of Bitcoin investors does remain impressively high, and very few are willing to liquidate their holdings.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, the fear and greed index, currently showing 53, has remained neutral for months now with no movement in either direction.</p>
<p>There are still a few dark clouds on the horizon that could keep crypto markets suppressed for a while.</p>
<p>The United States is still at war with the industry, and <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/two-things-to-watch-for-in-ripple-xrp-price-this-week-volatility-ahead/" data-wpel-link="internal">Ripple</a> could still lose its case. The specter of recession is still looming in America, which means less money to invest in high-risk assets.</p>
<h2>Crypto Market Outlook</h2>
<p>As evidenced by the on-chain analysis, crypto markets still haven’t moved this week. Total capitalization remains where it was five months ago at $1.2 trillion.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is trading flat at $29,350, while Ethereum remains stuck at $1,840 at the time of writing.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/this-indicator-signals-huge-move-ahead-for-btc-price-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">bright side</a>, crypto markets are still up 46% since the beginning of the year and have moved off the bear cycle bottom, so it&#8217;s not all doom and gloom.</p>
<p>Moreover, some analysts have <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/when-will-bitcoins-bull-run-start-analyst-chips-in/" data-wpel-link="internal">predicted</a> a new BTC all-time high around the halving in eight months’ time though that appears very unlikely at the moment.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The company praised the successful collaboration with Canadian regulators which led to the roll out of the services in the country.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase announced it has officially launched operations in Canada. As part of the initiative, the company introduced Coinbase One to local users &#8211; a 30-day trial offering zero trading fees and priority support.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The firm has been coping with severe regulatory issues in its homeland, with most problems coming from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). That dispute could be one reason why Coinbase has recently shifted its focus toward other countries.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8216;Our Vision Transcends Borders&#8217;</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite turning into one of the leading US-based crypto exchanges and becoming the first publicly-traded company of its kind, Coinbase </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbase-officially-launches-in-canada" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">disclosed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that its mission involves spreading abroad:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;While our journey towards transparency and compliance led us to becoming a publicly traded company in the United States, our vision transcends borders. Today, we proudly announce a pivotal milestone in our international expansion strategy – our official launch in Canada.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The team behind the platform explained that the expansion into the North American nation resulted from the comprehensive regulatory framework there and the local interest in innovation. Coinbase also outlined that Canadians are among the most intrigued in the crypto industry, with 30% planning to hop on the bandwagon soon.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Canadian users can now deposit and withdraw funds in CAD to and from their Coinbase wallets through Interac e-transfers. They are also allowed to onboard Coinbase One, which features zero trading fees, priority support, and enhanced staking rewards. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In addition, the company intends to enable withdrawals, seamless deposits, and high-value daily transaction limits later in 2023. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Unlike its regulatory problems at home, Coinbase praised its collaboration with the Canadian watchdogs, banking partners, and investors. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Recall that the US SEC </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/us-sec-files-a-lawsuit-against-coinbase-day-after-suing-binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">filed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> a lawsuit against the exchange in June this year, alleging it of violating several rules and offering trading services with unregistered securities, such as SOL, ADA, MATIC, and others.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Previous Efforts</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One of Coinbase&#8217;s recent expansions </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-officially-launches-platform-for-non-us-institutional-investors-in-bermuda-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">includes</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the launch of a platform in Bermuda that serves non-US institutional clients. The marketplace, which saw the light of day in May &#8211; allows users to trade bitcoin and ether perpetual futures and settle transactions in USDC. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;We would like to see the US take a similar approach instead of regulation by enforcement which has led to a disappointing trend for crypto development in the US,&#8221; the firm stated upon introducing the option.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Coinbase also </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-sees-uae-as-a-strategic-hub-for-international-operations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">eyed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the United Arab Emirates (UAE), highlighting the welcoming regulatory environment in the area. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;In short, the region is standing-out as a leader in the development of a web3 ecosystem, making it an attractive location to consider investing in. The vacuum created by other notable jurisdictions means that international counterparts, such as the UAE, are racing to fill the regulatory gap,&#8221; Nana Murugesan &#8211; VP of International and Business Development at Coinbase &#8211; said.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Subsequently, the company </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-ramps-up-efforts-to-expand-in-europe-partners-with-bitpanda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">partnered</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> with the Austrian crypto exchange Bitpanda at the end of May to strengthen its presence in Europe.</span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The total value locked in Base surpassed $200 million in less than a week since mainnet launch. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chainlink has expanded its integrations to a total of 12 by tapping the Coinbase-incubated layer-2 network Base. According to a recent update, Base joins the likes of Ethereum, Arbitrum, Avalanche, BNB Chain, and Polygon, among other projects.</p>
<p>The decentralized oracle network had first announced implementing its price feeds into Base a day before the latter&#8217;s mainnet launch.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://twitter.com/chainlink/status/1690817321151893504" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">integration</a> essentially enabled developers building on the layer-2 blockchain to access Chainlink Data Feeds and other web3 services.</li>
<li>In a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chainlink-price-feeds-are-now-live-on-base-to-unlock-secure-defi-ecosystem-growth-301895382.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">statement</a>, Jesse Pollak, Creator of Base and Head of Protocols at Coinbase, previously said,</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Chainlink Price Feeds are one of the leading price data solutions for developers when it comes to security, reliability, and usability.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The exec further highlighted that the native integration of Chainlink Price Feeds into Base will allow developers with the tools they need to port existing applications over to the blockchain and enable them to experiment with novel use cases that can be built on Base&#8217;s &#8220;hyper-scalable layer-2 environment.&#8221;</li>
<li>While Base has been operational for developer testing for a few months, it wasn&#8217;t until August 9th that the network was launched for the public.</li>
<li>Since hitting mainnet, Base has <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbases-base-notches-4th-rank-in-daily-tps-among-layer-2-solutions-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">received</a> an overall positive reception so far in terms of user engagement. The total value bridged to Base also exceeded $212 million.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, the total value <a href="https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/base" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">locked</a> in the blockchain surged to $205 million. This feat was achieved in less than a week since the mainnet launch.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[Two specific funds were responsible for most inflows: Canada’s Purpose Bitcoin ETF, and Switzerland’s 21Shares AG.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Crypto fund inflows are running positive again after a three-week lull period, with the vast majority of capital rushing into Bitcoin (BTC).</p>
<p>The renewed interest follows the release of inflation figures for July, which came in slightly better than expectations.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Funds Back In Profit</h2>
<p>According to CoinShares’ weekly digital asset flows <a href="https://blog.coinshares.com/volume-144-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-report-7d29c8c04df5" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">report</a>, inflows to crypto funds totaled $28.5 million last week, with $27 million heading into Bitcoin. This follows a three-week period in which Bitcoin experienced $144 million in net outflows.</p>
<p>Other digital assets including Ether (ETH) and XRP also scored inflows last week of $2.5 million and $0.5 million respectively. The latter is now on its sixteenth week of consecutive inflows, with assets under management rising by 127% since the year began.</p>
<p>“We believe the improved sentiment is due to the recent US inflation data, which was slightly below expectations, signifying that a September rate hike is less likely,” CoinShares wrote.</p>
<p>Bitcoin and other digital assets fell consistently last year as the Federal Reserve embarked on the fastest rate hiking cycle in history, in order to quell record-high inflation.</p>
<p>With CPI <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-unfazed-as-cpi-for-july-increases-by-0-2-mom/" data-wpel-link="internal">back down</a> to 3.2% year over year, the Fed’s hiking cycle may finally have peaked, potentially marking a good time to invest. According to CME FedWatch Tool, the market i pricing in an 88% chance that the Fed will keep rates flat at 5.25% at its next September meeting.</p>
<h2>ETF Excitement</h2>
<p>The Bank of Canada – which closely tracks the decisions of the Federal Reserve – is also expected to keep its rate flat at 5% until the end of the year. CoinShares’ report noted that most crypto inflows last week ($24 million) went to Canada’s Purpose ETF, the world’s first Bitcoin spot ETF.</p>
<p>The only other country to see substantial inflows was Switzerland, at $7.9 million.</p>
<p>Excitement over a potential U.S. Bitcoin spot ETF began growing in June after BlackRock filed for the product, followed by Fidelity and others. The hype not only sent BTC above $30,000 but led to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-investment-products-attract-highest-inflows-since-2021/" data-wpel-link="internal">multiple weeks of inflows</a> to Bitcoin funds totaling $742 million.</p>
<p>ETF analysts at Bloomberg currently <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bloomberg-boosts-bitcoin-spot-etf-approval-odds-to-65-heres-why/" data-wpel-link="internal">assign</a> a 65% likelihood of a Bitcoin spot ETF being approved in 2023.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[According to the results, the bitcoin-loving far-right candidate has the best chance to become Argentina's next president.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Javier Milei &#8211; a 52-year-old Argentine politician, businessman, and economist &#8211; collected the most votes in the country&#8217;s primary presidential elections. The leader of the political coalition La Libertad Avanza (Freedom Advances) is a keen advocate of bitcoin and a fierce opponent of the central bank.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He has also gained popularity due to a crypto scandal involving the dubious digital asset platform called CoinX. Milei advertised the entity on his Instagram account in December 2021, whereas the Argentine authorities halted its activities a few months later, claiming it had no legal permission to operate inside the country&#8217;s borders.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">High Chances to Become President</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Arguably the most eccentric presidential candidate in Argentina &#8211; Javier Milei &#8211; </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2023-argentina-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">amassed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> over 7 million votes (over 31.5% of the overall support) in the open primaries, held approximately two months before the general election. The center-right political coalition Together for Change (which has still not outlined its nominees) ranked second.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It is worth mentioning that Milei has won a decisive victory in almost every Argentine region apart from the capital Buenos Aires, where Utility for the Homeland (the party behind the current President Alberto Fernandez) got the majority of the votes. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Serving as the next political leader of the South American nation sounds like a tough job considering the triple-digit inflation, the increasing poverty line, and the overall economic downfall that has spread throughout the region. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Milei has previously </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/alexstanczyk/status/1611010925401903104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1611010925401903104%7Ctwgr%5E7939f4de0f665cb171542fe3fd7e358d9cf07d63%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fbitcoiner-javier-milei-wins-argentina-presidential-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">opposed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the controversial policies conducted by the central bank, calling the financial institution a &#8220;scam.&#8221; He also displayed himself as a proponent of bitcoin, arguing that Argentina could solve some of its issues by opening its arms toward it:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;The point is that the first thing we have to understand is that the central bank is a scam. It is a mechanism by which politicians cheat to the good people with the inflationary tax. What bitcoin is representing is the return of money to its original creator: the private sector&#8230;</span></p>
<p>Bitcoin has an algorithm that one day it will reach a certain amount, and there is no more, and it can compete with other currencies.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Argentines seem to have had enough of their financial problems and are willing to give a chance to the peculiar Milei, whose nickname is &#8220;el Peluca&#8221; (the Wig) because of his bizarre hairstyle. In fact, many locals have already </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/argentines-embrace-crypto-following-resignation-of-economy-minister/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">hopped</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> on the cryptocurrency bandwagon, converting their depreciating pesos into BTC or USDT to preserve their net worths from the unrelenting inflation. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Scandal Involving Milei</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Besides his positive comments on bitcoin, the far-right presidential candidate made the headlines last summer when a group of harmed CoinX investors </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/argentina-presidential-candidate-sued-for-promoting-a-crypto-ponzi-scheme/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">sued</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> him for promoting a fraudulent cryptocurrency project.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The individuals maintained that they parted with around $300,000 after Milei advertised the platform on his Instagram account, thus prompting them to invest. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">CoinX promised significant returns for its users and claimed it had gathered a team of professionals to give customers the best advice. However, Argentina&#8217;s National Securities Commission (CNV) terminated its operations since it lacked the necessary authorization to provide services in the country.</span></p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Bitcoin network is designed to foster some level of anonymity, allowing users to perform transactions globally without revealing their true identity. Despite this, the blockchain network is not private, as transactions are publicly open to everyone. Anyone can also identify the total Bitcoin holdings of any wallet address.</p>
<p>Like the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-for-beginners/" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin protoco</a>l, most blockchains today are public. This means that transactions and other on-chain data that should otherwise be private easily become public knowledge.</p>
<p>Blockchain project Firo introduces a solution to fix this problem. Through its new privacy protocol dubbed Lelantus Spark, the company aims to solve the issue of private on-chain transactions.</p>
<h2>Introducing Lelantus Spark</h2>
<p>Lelantus Spark (also called Spark) is a privacy protocol developed by Firo developers. Firo (formerly known as Zcoin) is a blockchain project that uses cryptography to build a private ecosystem for its users.</p>
<p>The Lelantus Spark project has <a href="https://firo.org/2021/08/24/presenting-lelantus-spark.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">been in the works</a> since August 2021. It came as part of further development of the project’s Lelantus v1/v2 protocol. Combining existing key features in the former protocol and adding new features to the new protocol, Lelantus Spark is positioned at the forefront of privacy protocols deployed on the blockchain. These privacy-preserving features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spark addresses</li>
<li>Multisignature operations</li>
<li>View keys</li>
<li>Modular design</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Spark Addresses</strong></h3>
<p>The Spark address is a stealth address that masks a user’s public key by using cryptography to generate a one-time wallet address. Anyone can send crypto assets like Firo from transparent addresses to Spark addresses. With the Spark addresses, users can conceal their total holdings in the wallet and details about the transactions they make, such as the amount, time of the transaction, and history of the flow of the transferred asset.</p>
<p>Most public blockchains have an explorer that allows anyone to view the transferred amount and time of the transaction. In Lelantus v1, users need to manually anonymize any funds received.</p>
<p>However, Lelantus Spark uses Spark addresses to bolster anonymity with ease. This feature ensures that third parties cannot identify the sender or receiver of a cryptocurrency without using additional external information.</p>

<h3><strong>Multisignature Operations</strong></h3>
<p>Multisignature operations enable several trustless entities to cooperatively generate, receive, and sign transactions tied to a multisig address.</p>
<p>Lelantus Spark supports multi-signature operations through a modified Chaum-Pedersen discrete logarithm zero-knowledge proof. Decentralized exchanges and custodians are beneficiaries of the multi-signature operation. It can also be used in cases where more than one party is needed to approve a transaction.</p>
<h3><strong>View Keys</strong></h3>
<p>A view key is a valuable feature that allows wallet owners and creators of stealth addresses to willingly grant third parties access to see incoming and/or outgoing transactions to/from their wallet addresses without the ability to spend those funds</p>
<p>The feature is useful for accounting, auditing, and benefactor purposes. Offloaded scan services can also be used on online and mobile wallets.</p>
<h3><strong>Modular Design</strong></h3>
<p>Lelantus Spark’s dynamic design allows it to use several layers of privacy, relying on well-established cryptographic time-tested building blocks. These include Pedersen commitments, range proofs, zero-knowledge proofs, and discrete logarithm equality proofs that enable straightforward security analysis without needing trusted setup processes.</p>
<h2>Lelantus Spark Goes Live on Testnet</h2>
<p>In mid-July 2023, Firo announced its plan to launch the Lelantus Spark testnet after undergoing a series of cryptographic and implementation audits.</p>
<p>The testnet will allow public users to test the protocol in a safe and controlled ecosystem before it gets deployed on the mainnet. During this period, the developer team will gather data and feedback that will be used to make necessary adjustments to the protocol to make it as secure, private, and user-friendly as possible.</p>
<p>The Lelantus Spark testnet was <a href="https://firo.org/2023/07/31/lelantus-spark-testnet-launched.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">launched</a> on July 31st. Participants in the testnet will be offered incentives for engaging in the project’s bug bounty program and mainnet Firo token rewards incentives. There will also be other fun quizzes that will bring the Spark community members together.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Firo’s Lelantus Spark highlights the company’s commitment to bringing its privacy-loving users to more secure and private mediums of funds transfer. The project achieves this by building new tools and modifying existing ones to maintain a private blockchain experience.</p>
<p>As the protocol progresses from testnet to mainnet, Spark grounds itself as a haven from public blockchain networks that litter the crypto industry.</p>
