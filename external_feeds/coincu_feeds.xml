<p>The exchange announced the inclusion of the Korean won fiat currency market for Apecoin (APE), Render Token (RNDR), and Fantom (FTM). The trading for these tokens is scheduled to commence precisely at 4:00 pm on Tuesday, July 18, 2023.</p>



<p>The addition of Apecoin, Render Token, and Fantom to Bithumb&#8217;s roster reflects the exchange&#8217;s ongoing efforts to expand its offerings and cater to a broader range of investment preferences. By including these promising cryptocurrencies, Bithumb aims to provide its users with enhanced opportunities for diversification and potential growth.</p>



<p>While Bithumb&#8217;s trading volume is currently about one-tenth the size of Upbit, South Korea&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, this listing announcement signals the exchange&#8217;s intention to further solidify its position in the market. Bithumb has consistently demonstrated its commitment to adapt to evolving market trends and customer demands, and this latest move is a testament to its proactive approach.</p>



<p>Apecoin (APE), Render Token (RNDR), and Fantom (FTM) have all gained significant traction in the crypto space, attracting attention from investors and enthusiasts alike. Apecoin focuses on decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions, while Render Token powers the Render Network, which offers distributed GPU rendering services. Fantom, on the other hand, is a platform designed for high-performance smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps).</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Sui Network&#8217;s daily transactions skyrocketed by over 50 times in two weeks.</em></li>



<li><em>The surge is driven by the popularity of the blockchain game Sui 8192, where each move is recorded as a transaction.</em></li>



<li><em>Sui Network surpasses Solana in daily transactions and holds a market capitalization of around $500 million.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Sui Network, a blockchain platform, has witnessed an unprecedented surge in daily transactions, marking a significant milestone for the network.</strong></h5>

<p>Just four days ago, the daily transactions on the Sui Network <a href="https://coincu.com/202781-sui-network-reaches-explosive-growth-with-1-m/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassed</a> 22.2 million, representing an astounding increase of over 50 times compared to the previous two weeks. This surge in activity has been primarily attributed to the popularity of a blockchain-based game called Sui 8192.</p>

<p>Sui 8192, developed by the team behind the Sui-native Ethos Wallet, has emerged as a major driving force behind the surge in network activity.</p>



<p>The game draws inspiration from the well-known 2048 puzzle game but adds a unique twist by leveraging blockchain technology. Players are tasked with strategically shifting and combining tiles using arrow keys, with the ultimate goal of reaching the coveted 8192 tile.</p>



<p>What sets Sui 8192 apart is that each move made during gameplay is recorded as a transaction on the Sui blockchain, akin to the creation of a non-fungible token (NFT). As a result, players are required to pay gas fees for every transaction, leading to a substantial increase in daily activity on the <a href="https://coincu.com/193868-sui-network-releases-sip-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sui Network</a>.</p>

<p>This remarkable growth in users and transactions has <a href="https://twitter.com/DegenerateNews/status/1680148514838560769" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">propelled</a> the Sui Network ahead of Solana in terms of daily blockchain transactions. Solana, known for its scalability and support for gaming applications, has faced several network outages in recent months and years, allowing Sui to take the spotlight with its impressive surge in network activity. The Sui Network&#8217;s architecture and object-based programming language have been cited as crucial factors contributing to the success of Sui 8192 and the overall network&#8217;s performance.</p>



<p>Looking at the token metrics, the SUI token currently boasts a <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/sui/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">market capitalization</a> of nearly $500 million. Additionally, the daily active address count stands at approximately 30,000, underscoring the growing engagement and adoption of the Sui Network.</p>



<p>At the moment, the SUI token is trading at $0.755. Prior to that, SUI spiked to $0.78 with a gain of nearly 15% in the past 24 hours. Currently, the token&#8217;s momentary response has yet to see a clear bullish signal as the resistance area at $0.75 is still not fully conquered.</p>

<p>In terms of future token issuance, the Sui Foundation has provided a detailed plan. The <a href="https://coincu.com/182613-sui-network-launch-mainnet-on-may-3rd/">Sui mainnet</a> is scheduled to go live on May 3, 2023. The long-term circulating supply of SUI tokens is set at 10 billion, with approximately 5% of the tokens to be in circulation at the mainnet launch. The remaining tokens will be <a href="https://sui.io/token-schedule" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> according to a proposed schedule, with the full token supply expected to be released by April 2030.

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Cathie Wood remains bullish on Coinbase following the court ruling favoring Ripple Labs against the SEC.</em></li>



<li><em>ARK Invest continues to sell off Coinbase stock, attributing the activity to profit-taking and reallocating capital to other opportunities.</em></li>



<li><em>Industry experts see the Ripple ruling as a potential positive precedent for Coinbase and other exchanges facing regulatory challenges, although concerns about unresolved regulatory aspects remain.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cathie Wood, the founder, and CEO of ARK Investment Management, expressed her optimistic view on cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase following a court ruling in favor of Ripple Labs against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on July 13.</strong></h5>

<p>Despite ARK Invest&#8217;s <a href="https://coincu.com/201934-cathie-woods-ark-invest-cuts-coinbase-shares/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent sales </a>of Coinbase stock, Wood <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2023-07-17/cathie-wood-on-ark-fund-flows-coinbase-ai-investments-video" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remains positive</a> about the exchange, citing the court ruling as a positive development for the industry, she said on <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2023-07-17/cathie-wood-on-ark-fund-flows-coinbase-ai-investments-video" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg TV</a></em>.</p>



<p>ARK Invest recently <a href="https://coincu.com/203046-ark-invest-lose-weight-on-coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold</a> off an additional $50 million worth of Coinbase stock on July 15 as the stock rallied. Wood attributed the selling activity to profit-taking and reallocating capital to other investment opportunities.</p>

<p>Ripple Labs secured a huge victory in its court lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, sending cryptocurrency prices and associated equities up toward the close of the week.</p>



<p>In December 2020, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple, alleging the crypto and blockchain solutions provider of marketing its XRP coin as unregistered securities. A court in the Southern District of New York determined on Thursday that XRP is a security when sold to institutions but not when sold to the general public. After the judgment, XRP surged almost 90% to $0.82.</p>



<p>Wood&#8217;s sentiments align with other industry experts who believe that the Ripple ruling could set a positive precedent for Coinbase and other exchanges currently facing regulatory challenges. The ruling potentially influenced the ongoing legal battles of <a href="https://coincu.com/203016-coinbase-suspends-staking-services-sec-lawsuits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a> and <a href="https://coincu.com/203514-binance-terminates-sponsorship-with-argentina/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a> with the SEC.</p>



<p>Despite receiving a Wells Notice in March and facing a lawsuit from the SEC in June, Coinbase&#8217;s share price has shown resilience, remaining relatively stable. Wood emphasized the robustness of Coinbase&#8217;s stock value.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1172-1024x512.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1172-1024x512.png" alt="Cathie Wood Stays Positive On Coinbase After Ripple&#039;s Lawsuit" class="wp-image-203542" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1172-1024x512.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1172-300x150.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1172-768x384.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1172-360x180.png 360w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1172-750x375.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1172-1140x570.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1172.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Cathie Wood Stays Positive On Coinbase After Ripple&#039;s Lawsuit 12"></a></figure></div>


<p>While many are optimistic about Coinbase&#8217;s future, analysts from Berenberg Capital Markets cautioned that regulatory aspects for crypto exchanges are still unresolved. They specifically mentioned Coinbase Earn, a product offering crypto staking yield, as potentially vulnerable to being defined as a security.</p>



<p>Coinbase&#8217;s stock has performed well this year, rallying 189.3% so far. On Monday, it closed at $105.55, slightly below its one-year high of $107.</p>



<p>Overall, Wood&#8217;s positive outlook on Coinbase is driven by the recent court ruling and the resilience demonstrated by the exchange, despite regulatory challenges.</p>

<p>Traditionally, achieving cost-effectiveness for Ethereum Virtual Machine dApps involved using rollups or sidechains. The introduction of Neon EVM on Solana presents a layer 2 alternative, enabling significant savings in transaction costs.</p>



<p>While Ethereum&#8217;s average transaction fee is around $2, using layer 2 solutions can bring costs down to $0.5-$0.1. In contrast, Solana boasts an average transaction fee of just 0.00001 SOL (~$0.0002) per transaction, offering remarkable savings of 10,000x. The effectiveness of Neon EVM has been validated through early Devnet tests.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Binance, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, has unexpectedly terminated its sponsorship agreement with the Argentina national football team.</em></li>



<li><em>The deal, signed in early 2022, was controversial as the exchange competed with the Chiliz/Socios fan token project for sponsorship rights.</em></li>



<li><em>Binance&#8217;s decision comes amidst growing regulatory challenges, declining profits, and recent layoffs at the exchange.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Binance, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, has <a href="https://twitter.com/BinanceArg/status/1680971083904700416" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">terminated</a> its sponsorship agreement with the reigning World Cup champion, Argentina. The unexpected move was announced on Twitter, stating that the exchange had ended its sponsorship of the Argentina football team.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1161.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1161-1024x576.png" alt="Binance Terminates Sponsorship Deal With Argentina Amid Falling Profit" class="wp-image-203516" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1161-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1161-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1161-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1161-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1161-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1161.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Binance Terminates Sponsorship Deal With Argentina Amid Falling Profit 19"></a></figure></div>


<p>The sponsorship agreement between the exchange and Argentina was signed in early 2022 for a period of five years. The exact value of the agreement was not disclosed. As part of the deal, Binance&#8217;s logo was set to appear on the team&#8217;s training jerseys and stadiums during friendlies featuring Argentina.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Binance has decided to end its association with the AFA (Argentine Football Association). We regularly evaluate the results of our partnerships around the world and unfortunately, despite being offered time and opportunity, AFA has not fully met its contractual obligations, which goes against our business values ​​and our association principles. Binance remains committed to growing in Argentina and continues to engage with local partners, including prestigious universities, with the goal of continuing to expand educational efforts and strategic business alliances,&#8221; the exchange stated.<a href="https://twitter.com/BinanceArg/status/1680971083904700416" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The sponsorship deal itself was surrounded by controversy, as Binance competed with the Chiliz/Socios fan token issuance project to become the sponsor for the Argentina team, including star player Lionel Messi. Socios, feeling aggrieved, sued the Argentine Football Federation (AFA), seeking to be the sole fan token partner until 2026.</p>

<p>This termination of sponsorship comes at a challenging time for Binance. The exchange has faced regulatory and legal challenges globally, resulting in <a href="https://coincu.com/202996-binance-fired-1000-people-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent layoffs</a> of over 1,000 employees. The <a href="https://coincu.com/203495-binance-cuts-benefits-and-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">declining profits</a> of the company have also led to the cessation of certain employee benefits.</p>



<p>In addition to the Argentina football team, the exchange sponsors other teams and issues fan tokens for S.S Lazio (Italy), FC Porto (Portugal), and Santos FC (Brazil). The exchange has also partnered with the Confederation of African Football to sponsor the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (CAN) and collaborates with the F1 Alpine team. Binance&#8217;s NFT platform has partnered with Cristiano Ronaldo to release NFT collections for fans.</p>



<p>In recent years, Binance has faced various legal and business challenges. The exchange has been sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and is rumored to face potential criminal prosecution by the US Department of Justice. It has encountered regulatory troubles in several countries, including the UK, the Netherlands, Belgium, Cyprus, Brazil, Austria, France, Germany, and Australia.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1163.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1163.png" alt="Binance Terminates Sponsorship Deal With Argentina Amid Falling Profit" class="wp-image-203519" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1163.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1163-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1163-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1163-750x500.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Binance Terminates Sponsorship Deal With Argentina Amid Falling Profit 21"></a></figure></div>


<p>These developments have impacted the exchange&#8217;s market share, particularly in the US, where its <a href="https://coincu.com/197963-binanceus-lost-as-judge-rejects-its-accusations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance.US</a> platform has lost a banking partner, limiting its ability to handle USD transactions. The exchange has also reportedly laid off a significant number of employees, although Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has disputed the accuracy of the reported figures.</p>



<p>In late June, several key members of Binance&#8217;s senior management resigned, including the Chief Counsel, Chief Strategy Officer, and Vice President of Legal Compliance. These departures are believed to be linked to the ongoing investigation by the US Department of Justice into Binance&#8217;s activities.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Binance, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, is facing financial challenges as it grapples with falling profits and regulatory issues.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1158.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1158-1024x576.png" alt="Binance Cuts Benefits Of Employees Amid Regulatory Challenge" class="wp-image-203507" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1158-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1158-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1158-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1158-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1158-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1158.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Binance Cuts Benefits Of Employees Amid Regulatory Challenge 22"></a></figure></div>


<p>As Coincu <a href="https://coincu.com/202996-binance-fired-1000-people-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, the company recently made headlines for laying off over 1,000 employees, and now it has been revealed that Binance is also reducing employee benefits as part of its cost-cutting measures.</p>



<p>According to the<em> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/binance-cuts-back-employee-benefits-citing-decline-in-profit-51d51cf7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wall Street Journal</a></em>, Binance has decided to cut back on several employee benefits, including mobile-phone reimbursement, fitness reimbursement, and work-from-home expenses. These changes were communicated to employees through an internal message viewed by the publication. The message cited the current market environment and regulatory climate, which have led to a decline in profit, as the reasons for scaling back on benefits. The exchange hinted that further cost-cutting actions may be necessary in the future.</p>



<p>The decision to reduce benefits comes at a time when Binance is facing regulatory challenges in multiple jurisdictions. The exchange has been <a href="https://coincu.com/200786-binance-in-crisis-executives-flee-storms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">embroiled</a> in lawsuits from regulatory bodies such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). These legal battles have taken a toll on Binance&#8217;s financial performance and market share.</p>

<p>During a company meeting on its sixth anniversary, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, also known as CZ, <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1679951762906595330" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">assured</a> employees that the exchange remains profitable and has not been impacted by the SEC lawsuit. However, he cautioned that additional layoffs could occur every three to six months, and he expressed uncertainty about when the cut benefits would be reinstated.</p>



<p>The recent layoffs and benefit reductions have raised concerns among employees and industry observers. Some former employees have reported that several hundred customer-service employees were let go, adding to the already significant number of layoffs. CZ disputed the reported numbers and stated that layoffs are a regular occurrence in any company.</p>

<p>Binance&#8217;s regulatory struggles have not been limited to the United States. The exchange has faced challenges in Europe, leading to its exit from certain markets due to regulatory hurdles. These issues have contributed to a decline in Binance&#8217;s market dominance and raised questions about its ability to navigate the evolving regulatory landscape.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://coincu.com/200804-binance-abandons-dutch-market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a> adjusts its operations to address financial strain and regulatory pressures, the industry will closely monitor its future actions. Rebuilding market share and ensuring compliance with regulations will be key priorities for the exchange as it seeks to regain stability in the highly competitive cryptocurrency market.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>SEC Chair</em> Gary Gensler<em> comments on the recent court ruling in the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit against Ripple, expressing both satisfaction and disappointment with the outcome.</em></li>



<li><em>The court ruling determined that institutional sales of Ripple&#8217;s tokens violated federal securities laws, while sales on exchanges and programmatic sales were not considered securities.</em></li>



<li><em>The ruling&#8217;s implications for retail investors and the potential for an appeal raise uncertainty about the future regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler has publicly addressed the recent court ruling in the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit against Ripple, stated that while he was disappointed with a district court&#8217;s decision in the Ripple case regarding retail investors, he was pleased with the portion of the order that found institutional sales of the tokens did violate federal securities laws.</strong></h5>

<p>Last week, Ripple <a href="https://coincu.com/202599-ripple-wins-against-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">achieved</a> a partial victory as the court ruled that institutional sales of the XRP tokens violated federal securities laws, while sales on exchanges and programmatic sales did not qualify as the sale of securities. The ruling was based on the SEC&#8217;s inability to establish that speculative investors had a reasonable expectation of profits from the efforts of others.</p>



<p>During a talk on artificial intelligence at the National Press Club, Gensler was asked about the ruling&#8217;s impact on his stance on cryptocurrency and whether it necessitates federal legislation for regulatory oversight. He expressed satisfaction with the court&#8217;s decision to recognize the importance of investor protection for institutional investors. However, he voiced disappointment regarding the ruling&#8217;s implications for retail investors and stated that the SEC is still assessing the opinion.</p>



<p>Gensler reiterated similar sentiments in an interview with <em><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/video/sec-chair-warns-ais-potential-201110024.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yahoo Finance</a></em> later in the day. He acknowledged the court&#8217;s recognition of XRP as a security for institutional investors and its consideration of fair notice. He mentioned that the SEC is continuing to evaluate the ruling and its implications.</p>



<p>The SEC chair declined to provide further details on the SEC&#8217;s requirements for being confident about spot <a href="https://coincu.com/202973-sec-now-acknowledges-blackrock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin exchange-traded funds</a> (ETFs), citing ongoing litigation and the need to avoid prejudging the applications before the regulatory body.</p>

<p>When questioned about the SEC&#8217;s regulatory approach, Gensler highlighted that the SEC has engaged in rulemaking, including notice and comment rulemaking and special purpose broker-dealer licensing. He also acknowledged the existence of the European Union&#8217;s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework, which emphasizes rulemaking.</p>



<p>This public response from Gensler marks the first time he has addressed the Ripple case since the court ruling. His expressed disappointment with the verdict&#8217;s impact on retail investors coincided with a drop in the price of Ripple&#8217;s XRP, following a brief nearly 100% rally in response to the mixed verdict.</p>

<p>The ruling&#8217;s nuanced differentiation between private sales to accredited investors and programmatic sales to exchanges has raised concerns among experts, including former SEC official <a href="https://coincu.com/203157-xrp-security-or-not-former-sec-official-reveals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John Reed Stark</a>. Stark believes the ruling is on &#8220;shaky ground&#8221; and anticipates an appeal. He criticized the ruling&#8217;s potential creation of a new category of &#8220;quasi-securities&#8221; dependent on investor sophistication, deeming it counter-intuitive and inconsistent with SEC case law.</p>



<p>The possibility of an appeal introduces uncertainty regarding the final outcome of the case and the future regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Customers Bank emerges as a top banking partner for the US crypto industry after the closure of Silvergate Capital and Signature Bank.</em></li>



<li><em>The bank offers the Customers Bank Instant Token (CBIT) platform for 24/7 payments, attracting clients from both crypto and other industries.</em></li>



<li><em>Customers Bank also downplays its crypto connections but continues to serve major crypto players while focusing on risk management and expanding its payments business.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Customers Bank, a small Pennsylvania-based bank, has become a preferred banking partner for the US crypto industry, attracting a wave of new clients after the collapse of crypto-friendly banks Silvergate Capital and Signature Bank.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1153.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="978" height="733" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1153.png" alt="Customers Bank Now Emerges As Favorite Banking Partner For US Crypto Industry" class="wp-image-203489" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1153.png 978w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1153-300x225.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1153-768x576.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1153-750x562.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 978px) 100vw, 978px" title="Customers Bank Now Emerges As Favorite Banking Partner For US Crypto Industry 28"></a></figure></div>


<p>With its platform Customers Bank Instant Token (CBIT), the bank offers 24/7 payments for its crypto clients, similar to Silvergate Capital&#8217;s now-closed Silvergate Exchange Network. The closures of Silvergate and Signature Bank left little competition for Customers Bank, positioning it as a leading player in the market.</p>



<p>According to a <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-17/after-ftx-and-silvergate-customers-bank-cubi-becomes-crypto-s-favorite-bank#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a></em> report, Customers Bank has partnered with hundreds of digital asset firms, including major exchanges, market makers, and stablecoin issuers. It managed to attract new clients from the crypto sector as well as technology, venture capital, and fund finance sectors after the collapse of Silvergate and Signature Bank. The bank&#8217;s staff worked tirelessly to onboard these new clients, positioning the bank as a reliable and trusted banking partner.</p>



<p>However, the bank is now downplaying its connections to the crypto industry. The bank has decided to limit crypto-related deposits on its Customers Bank Instant Token platform to no more than 15% of its total balance sheet. Deposits on the platform accounted for around 13% of the bank&#8217;s total deposits at the end of Q1 2023. Customers Bank&#8217;s CEO, Sam Sidhu, has emphasized that the bank&#8217;s focus is on strengthening and deepening customer relationships across multiple industries, rather than relying solely on crypto-related deposits.</p>

<p>The US regulatory environment surrounding the crypto industry has become more stringent, with increased scrutiny from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and warnings from bank industry regulators about the risks of doing business with the crypto sector. As a result, Customers Bank is cautious about openly promoting its crypto business and is focused on managing risk and ensuring regulatory compliance.</p>



<p>Customers Bank continues to do business with major players in the crypto industry, including Circle Internet Financial, <a href="https://coincu.com/203024-us-sec-coinbase-listing-approval/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase Global</a>, <a href="https://coincu.com/180802-rumor-paxos-set-to-exit-canadian-market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paxos Trust</a>, GSR, <a href="https://coincu.com/200316-crypto-bank-anchorage-digital-sees-80-jump/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anchorage Digital</a>, and <a href="https://coincu.com/197226-bitgo-wont-buy-back-prime-trust/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BitGo</a>. However, the bank is exploring a broader plan to expand its payments business and build stronger customer relationships beyond the crypto sector.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1154.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1154-1024x683.png" alt="Customers Bank Now Emerges As Favorite Banking Partner For US Crypto Industry" class="wp-image-203491" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1154-1024x683.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1154-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1154-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1154-750x500.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1154-1140x760.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1154.png 1260w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Customers Bank Now Emerges As Favorite Banking Partner For US Crypto Industry 30"></a></figure></div>


<p>While the bank&#8217;s role as a banking partner for the crypto industry brings attention from regulators, the bank believes it has measures in place to manage risk effectively. It holds CBIT deposits in US currency and spreads large deposits among multiple banks to ensure FDIC coverage for its depositors.</p>



<p>The emergence of Customers Bank as a leading banking partner highlights the challenges faced by the crypto industry in accessing reliable banking services. The industry is still seeking more alternatives and broader support from traditional fiat banks to address its banking needs.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is introducing new social media guidance to combat illegal and non-compliant financial promotions.<p class="has-text-align-right"><a href="https://coincu.com/203479-financial-conduct-authority-crypto-promotions/" target="_blank">Read more...</a></p><p class="has-text-align-right"><a href="https://coincu.com"><strong>Coincu News</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>UK&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is introducing new social media guidance to combat illegal and non-compliant financial promotions.</em></li>



<li><em>The FCA aims to modernize regulations and address the use of social media in promoting financial products and services.</em></li>



<li><em>The FCA will also collaborate with the Advertising Standards Authority to increase scrutiny over illegal promotions, including those related to cryptocurrencies, and educate consumers about the risks involved.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/social-media-guidance-set-revamp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> its intention to enhance regulations surrounding financial promotions on social media platforms.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fca-scaled-1.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="587" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fca-scaled-1-1024x587.jpg" alt="UK Financial Conduct Authority Plans To Strengthen Regulations On Crypto Promotions" class="wp-image-203481" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fca-scaled-1-1024x587.jpg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fca-scaled-1-300x172.jpg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fca-scaled-1-768x440.jpg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fca-scaled-1-1536x881.jpg 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fca-scaled-1-2048x1174.jpg 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fca-scaled-1-750x430.jpg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fca-scaled-1-1140x654.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="UK Financial Conduct Authority Plans To Strengthen Regulations On Crypto Promotions 31"></a></figure></div>


<p>The proposed guidance aims to modernize the information provided by firms when advertising financial products or services online, taking into account the evolving landscape of social media advertising in the financial industry.</p>



<p>One of the key objectives of the new guidance is to support the FCA&#8217;s Consumer Investments Strategy, which aims to reduce the number of retail consumers investing in high-risk investments without appropriate risk tolerance or vulnerability characteristics by 2025.</p>



<p>In addition to addressing illegal and non-compliant financial promotions, the FCA will also focus on curbing promotions by financial influencers that may harm consumers. This includes a particular emphasis on influencers promoting cryptocurrency assets on social media platforms.</p>



<p>To tackle these issues, the <a href="https://coincu.com/196130-binance-unregister-in-uk-fca-before-war-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FCA</a> plans to collaborate with the Advertising Standards Authority to increase oversight and scrutiny of illegal financial promotions and advertising practices. The regulators also aim to educate both consumers and influencers about the risks associated with promoting financial products.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1151.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="900" height="500" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1151.png" alt="UK Financial Conduct Authority Plans To Strengthen Regulations On Crypto Promotions" class="wp-image-203483" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1151.png 900w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1151-300x167.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1151-768x427.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1151-750x417.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" title="UK Financial Conduct Authority Plans To Strengthen Regulations On Crypto Promotions 32"></a></figure></div>


<p>Starting from October 8, the FCA will implement several measures, including banning incentives for investing in cryptocurrencies such as &#8220;refer a friend&#8221; bonuses. Firms will be required to provide clear risk warnings and introduce a mandatory 24-hour cooling-off period to allow first-time investors sufficient time to make informed investment decisions.</p>



<p>The FCA&#8217;s efforts to regulate online financial promotions have gained momentum due to the rising influence of &#8220;finfluencers&#8221; and the potential risks associated with online consumer harm. The partnership with the Advertising Standards Authority has already resulted in changes to advertising policies of major technology companies, ensuring that only FCA-approved financial promotions are permitted.
