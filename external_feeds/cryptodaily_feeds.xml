			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Elects Stops Above 17265:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 9 December 2022</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) worked to sustain recent gains early in the Asian session as the pair elected Stops above the 17265.15 level, representing the 78.6% retracement of the recent depreciating range from 17424.59 to 16679.52.&nbsp; Recent upside progress has increased risk that Stops above the 17424.59 area could be tested and lead to a test of the 17759.18 area, representing the 38.2% retracement of the depreciating range from 21478.80 to 15460.&nbsp; Additional upside retracement levels in this depreciating range include the 18469 and 19179 areas.&nbsp; Traders are watching to see if BTC/USD can establish a constructive base around the 16880 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the depreciating range.&nbsp; If BTC/USD is able to extend its upward trajectory, upside areas of potential technical resistance and selling pressure include the 17791, 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, this 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas. &nbsp;Associated downside price objectives below current price activity include the 13369, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Technicians continue to eye the 14500.15 and 10432.73 areas as major downside targets, and additional downside price objectives include the 14613, 10727, and 9682 levels, areas that are related to selling pressure that intensified around the 20894.96 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 200-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;100-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and below the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;200-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 17352.03 and the&nbsp;100-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 17007.11.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;14500.15/ 13369.11/ 10727.75 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;18495.40/ 19199.48/ 20070.64 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bullishly above MACDAverage.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bearishly below SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bullishly above MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Binance crypto exchange has control over more than 87% of the entire exchange volume, according to the Block analytical platform that aggregates sheer information on trading volumes using CryptoCompare data.</p>
<p>Although an analysis of raw data provided by the same global cryptocurrency market data provider comes out to be around 28%, while CoinMarketCap, that is controlled by Binance, shows roughly the same figure at 24% for the first week of December 2022.</p>
<p>By the end of November, Binance controlled around 75% of the exchange volume in the crypto industry, according to data collected by The Block. One way or another, Binance is dominating the market and is expanding further. The exchange has recently taken over the Japanese market by acquiring Sakura Exchange BitCoin. Now the exchange has obtained the first license in Asia.</p>
<p>Binance has also started negotiations to take over the Indonesian Tokocrypto exchange that is currently suffering from bad market conditions. It has also acquired a stake in the Malaysian regulated MX Global trading platform. After claims by Japan&rsquo;s Financial Services Agency that Binance was operating without a license in Japan, it exited Japan in 2018 and also received another warning from the regulator in 2021 as some Japanese residents continued to still do business with Binance.</p>
<p>With these issues cleared up, Binance is now compliant to conduct operations not only in Japan and Malaysia, but also in France, Italy, Spain, Bahrain, Abu Dhabi, New Zealand, Kazakhstan, Poland, Lithuania, and Cyprus. The company plans to continue its expansion as it has accumulated over $1 billion to bail out troubled digital assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the company has no-office style culture of operations and may be easily targeted by local watchdogs in one of these countries. First on the list is the U.S. Congress which may approve more vigilant regulations to tract the activity of crypto exchanges followed by SEC. However, Binance U.S. is only a small portion of Binance&rsquo;s global business. So, it could be a matter of interest for some European Securities and exchange commissions to keep a close look on Binance operations in 2023.</p>
<p>Thus, the centralisation of the crypto market may become its weakness as other crypto exchanges are far behind the leader, as OKX exchange, the second largest exchange, controls about 6% of the daily trading volume in the crypto market, according to data from The Block.</p>
<p>Whether or not Binance will finally win this battle will largely depend on the actions of local authorities. Any witch hunt in the crypto market by monetary authorities may lead to the decentralisation of companies, like Binance, and lead to the immediate loss of confidence in regulators. So, any harsh actions could simply discourage crypto enthusiasts from the regulated market and push local exchanges to act without any regulation.</p>
<p>Binance itself may easily transform its business to operate in &ldquo;decentralised structures&rdquo; as it has no offices and no compliance department that would regularly communicate with officials, as is the norm with other regulated companies in other financial segments.</p>
<p>So far, Binance is a trend setter in the crypto market as it has been pioneering the industry with larger transparency than any other market players. Immediately after the crash of FTX, one of the largest crypto exchanges, on November 8, Binance&rsquo;s CEO, Changpeng Zhao, said that the company was ready to publish proof of reserves.</p>
<p>Moreover, the exchange has published a guide of &ldquo;What is Proof of Reserves and How it Works on Binance&rdquo;. On November 15 Changpeng Zhao continued with his &ldquo;Best practices for Exchanges&rdquo; and continued with a recovery fund to prop up legitimate projects in distress.</p>
<p>Other crypto exchanges majors like Bitfinex, Crypto.com, Huobi, OKX, and Kucoin, had to follow this example and release their &ldquo;proof of reserves&rdquo;. All of the majors have shown support to Binance&rsquo;s recovery fund and promised to invest more in crypto startups.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, transparency is not the only element that could challenge Binance&rsquo;s leadership. The company or event that will transform the crypto industry towards new standards while keeping it decentralised is the one that will become the new market leader.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Hideaways (HDWY), Stellar (XLM), and Bitcoin (BTC) are three promising cryptocurrencies that can help you diversify your cryptocurrency portfolio. Stellar and Bitcoin have recently dropped in value, whereas The Hideaways (HDWY) has remained stable.</p>
<p>Discover why Stellar (XLM) and Bitcoin (BTC) investors are making the switch to The Hideaways (HDWY), a newcomer in the crypto industry that has seen a rise of 800% in a short amount of time.</p>
Stellar (XLM) Price Falls 72% In One Year
<p>Stella (XLM) holders had a difficult year as the token's value has continued to decrease throughout the course of the year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Analysts question what will happen to Stellar (XLM) when over 25 billion tokens have been distributed. Stellar (XLM) is a novel coin that enables value transfer between assets, and it has several potential use cases.</p>
<p>Stellar (XLM) tokens enable smart contracts and facilitate the transfer of a wide variety of assets across the Stellar network. Unlike Bitcoin, XLM cannot be mined since it does not use the proof-of-work algorithm.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, one unit of Stellar (XLM) costs $0.09 and had a 24-hour trading volume of $53,669,096.</p>
Bitcoin (BTC) Price Struggling
<p>On Friday, cryptocurrency prices, including Bitcoin (BTC), fell. There are signs of widespread pessimism among market participants as the digital asset field continues to feel the effects of the repercussions of the bankruptcy of the crypto exchange FTX.</p>
<p>Bitcoin's value was decreasing, down to roughly $16,500, or less than 1% in the preceding 24 hours. Even while the entire repercussions of FTX's bankruptcy are likely still unknown, the largest crypto has maintained above its two-year lows near $15,550, which were recorded during peaks of selling over fears over instability at FTX and eventually its bankruptcy. However, Bitcoin has still lost over 20% of its value in the past few weeks and is currently selling for less than 25% of its record-high price of around $69,000 from a year ago.</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC) investors are looking elsewhere, and The Hideaways (HDWY) are the latest hot ticket.</p>
The Hideaways (HDWY) Price Is Expected To Grow By 15,000%
<p>The Hideaways (HDWY) could be an excellent option for anyone looking to invest in cryptocurrencies at the moment.&nbsp; When you join The Hideaways, you'll have access to a curated portfolio of luxury rental properties across the world, where you may invest and collect a passive income through rentals.</p>
<p>Here are some advantages of investing in HDWY tokens:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The platform's security has been validated by SolidProof, the industry-leading crypto security auditing organization.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">By doing this, the organization is assuring that there will be sufficient funds to operate into the next millennium.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">You can increase your return on investment (ROI) and avoid dealing with middlemen if you buy more high-end real estate anywhere in the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>The HDWY token is now selling for a miniscule price, with an expected price increase to $1 at the start of 2023.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Cardano (ADA) and Flow (FLOW) are among the top 50 biggest cryptocurrencies in market cap. However, many investors and traders are abandoning the coins in favor of new projects with better real-world utilities. The Hideaways (HDWY) is anticipated to climb to the top 50 cryptocurrencies in 2023.&nbsp;</p>
Is Cardano Under Selling Pressure?
<p>Active address usage on the Cardano (ADA) network has increased dramatically by 90% daily. It has been reported that there are now over 1.2 million allocated wallets on the blockchain.</p>
<p>The price of ADA has decreased by 5% during the past week. The current price of Cardano is $0.304558. However, a look at the token's 24-hour chart reveals that bulls are in command, leading the ADA/USD pair toward a bullish momentum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday, ADA bulls pushed the price to $0.318917, but they could not maintain momentum.</p>
<p>Since ADA has been doing poorly, there may be more on-chain action related to Cardano.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One possible explanation for the uptick in on-chain activity is traders cutting their losses and reducing their exposure to a faltering market by selling their holdings or taking profits.</p>
Flow Is Not Worth Your Money‒Here&rsquo;s Why
<p>The FLOW utility token helps the Flow economy function by functioning as both a means of trade and deposit. Despite its many utilities, FLOW had fallen this week after earlier in the week when it showed a more unexpected pattern of minor gains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After dropping 5.1% last week, the currency is trading at $1.11. During the past 30 days, FLOW has decreased by more than 34.5%. Do not make any new purchases of FLOW coins right now, advised veteran crypto traders.&nbsp;</p>
The Hideaways Is A Once-In-A-Lifetime Investment

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In light of the FTX incident, United States lawmakers are putting pressure on key federal financial regulators to investigate banks with ties to cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>
Senators Question Banks&nbsp;
<p>Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren and Tina Smith have written to multiple federal agencies and regulators, questioning the close ties between crypto markets and traditional banking. The aftermath of the FTX collapse has stirred up trouble, especially among lawmakers who have intensified their scrutiny of the industry even more since then. In this case, both the Senators, who are members of the Senate Banking House and Urban Affairs Committee, have addressed the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in their letter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>An excerpt from the letter reads,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;While the banking system has so far [been] relatively unscathed by the latest crypto crash, FTX&rsquo;s collapse shows that crypto may be more integrated into the banking system than regulators are aware.&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;Banks Had Close Ties To Crypto&rdquo;
<p>There have been other instances of associations between FTX and financial institutions. Several noteworthy banks, like Silvergate Capital, Provident Bancorp, Metropolitan Commercial, Signature, and Customers Bancorp, have all landed in hot water due to their significant exposure to the FTX ecosystem. The Senators&rsquo; letter referenced several banks and financial corporations struggling after prolonged exposure to FTX.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The letter wrote,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It appears crypto firms may have closer ties to the banking system than previously understood. Banks&rsquo; relationships with crypto firms raise questions about the safety and soundness of our banking system and highlight potential loopholes that crypto firms may try to exploit to gain further access.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

Banks In Trouble After FTX Crash
<p>Almost 90% of Silvergate&rsquo;s overall deposit base consisted of crypto deposits. In addition, more than 50% of the equity capital for Provident bank consisted of crypto loans. In the aftermath of the crash, Provident bank is experiencing losses as high as $27 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to a report in The New York Times, FTX&rsquo;s sister company Alameda Research had an $11.5 million investment in the Washington state-based Moonstone Bank. The latter&rsquo;s parent company FBH Corp was headed by Jean Chalopin, who is also the Chairman of the Bahamas-based Deltec Bank, which had a working relationship with stablecoin issuer Tether (an FTX trading partner).&nbsp;</p>
Regulators' Attention On SBF
<p>On the other hand, regulators have been focusing most of their attention on ex-FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. The Texas Securities Board has summoned him to investigate whether Texas securities laws were violated by offering unregistered securities products through FTX&rsquo;s yield-bearing service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other regulators, like the Financial Services Committee and the Senate Banking Committee, have also summoned Bankman-Fried to hearings discussing the collapse of the FTX ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Alameda Research-backed Ren Protocol has warned users of a potential risk of losses as it winds down its current Ren Version 1.0.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Ren team stated that once version 1.0 is retired, users may not be able to recover their assets.&nbsp;</p>
Potential Losses As Version 1.0 Shuts Down&nbsp;
<p>Alameda Research-backed Ren Protocol, which issues the wrapped bitcoin asset RenBTC, warned users that they risk losing their assets once it shuts down its existing Ren 1.0 version. The project team encouraged users to redeem their tokens before the current version shuts down and the tokens lose all their value. The primary reason behind the shuttering of version 1.0 is the lack of funding after the collapse of Alameda Research.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The developers added that users could unwrap their tokens and bridge them back to their native chains. The Ren team plans to disable mints on Ren shortly, meaning it would be impossible to deposit assets on the platform to bridge to other networks. Additionally, burns will also be disabled within 30 days.</p>
Compatibility Issues&nbsp;
<p>Once Ren&rsquo;s version 1.0 is shut down, it will be replaced by Ren 2.0, a new, community-run version. However, the Ren team warned that the two projects might not be compatible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As announced previously, the Ren 1.0 network is shutting down due to the events surrounding Alameda. As compatibility between Ren 1.0 and 2.0 cannot be guaranteed, holders of Ren assets should bridge back to native chains ASAP, or risk losing them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ren announced on the 18th of November that it was releasing a new protocol version. The announcement stated that the new protocol would be launched in parallel with the shutdown of the current version. This implied to users that current bridged assets may still be usable. However, the announcement has made it clear that current assets would not be usable on the new version of the platform and may be lost forever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>RenVM, the company behind the protocol, was acquired by Alameda Research in 2021. However, the collapse of Alameda necessitated the speeding up of the move to the new version of Ren.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marking this event as the end of Alameda&rsquo;s involvement in the project by sunsetting Ren 1.0 safeguards the reputation, integrity, and hence long-term prospects of the Ren ecosystem.</p>

<p>According to available data, there are currently 1130 renBTC currently on Ethereum.</p>
Users Are Confused And Angry&nbsp;
<p>The announcement from the Ren team has created considerable confusion and anger in the community as users woke up to the possibility of losing their assets in their entirety. Users also wondered if the Ren token itself was in any type of danger following recent events. One frustrated user vented,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we hold tokens on a CEX, do we need to do something?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Other users were confused, asking for clarification about their REN tokens and if the current update would impact those as well. Several users asked the Ren team to issue a clarification, adding that the announcement had led to panic selling. So far, the Ren team has not responded to these tweets. However, it did issue instructions on how users could check if they have bridged assets that need withdrawing.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Amber Group has terminated a sponsorship deal with Chelsea football club and has also cut its workforce again in order to survive the crypto winter.</p>
<p>Amber Group, one of the leading trading and lending platforms in Asia, has terminated a partnership with the London-based Chelsea football club. The partnership only began last May and had the Chelsea players wearing the Amber WhaleFin logo on their shirts.</p>
<p>As reported by an article on Bloomberg, the sponsorship deal was said to be worth $25 million a year. Amber is now following a legal process which will enable it to end the deal.</p>
<p>On top of the scrapping of the sponsorship deal Amber Group has also cut its workforce again. The latest cuts will see the workforce slashed from 700 to less than 400. At the peak of operations the trading and lending platform employed around 1,100.</p>
<p>In order to further cut costs Amber plans to move to cheaper offices in Hong Kong. Offices in other regions will likely close, with the employees there given the opportunity to work from home.</p>
<p>All of these moves are part of a major strategy to cut costs in what is a very difficult time for the crypto sector following the collapse and ensuing fall out from Sam Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s FTX platform.</p>
<p>Amber Group will now move its focus away from retail customers and will instead target larger institutions such as family offices and high-net-worth individuals.</p>
<p>The Asian digital asset platform has also suffered bereavement in recent times. Its co-founder Tiantian Kullander died in his sleep at the age of only 30.</p>

			  <guid isPermaLink="false">https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2022/12/defi-and-web3-are-broken-developers-can-fix-it-using-blockchain</guid>
			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Web2 and Web3 are similar technologies, but developers approach challenges differently. Web2 focuses on reading and writing content, whereas Web3 focuses on creating content. The latter utilizes blockchain technology to facilitate user information exchange and enhance security.</p>
<p>Around 20,000 smart contract developers work full-time in DeFi and Web3, but it's a small number of the 27 million developers globally. At the same time, the number of Unique Active Wallets interacting with blockchain applications reached an average of two million per day. Still, compared to Web2 app Instagram&rsquo;s 500 million daily active users and 4.2 billion likes per day - blockchain apps fight to onboard users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ethereum and its Solidity programming language have long been the go-to choice for DeFi developers building financial services on the blockchain. However, DeFi on Ethereum has seen over $285m in hacks; the rewards could be more fairly shared, and Ethereum continues to be congested and expensive.</p>
<p>These issues cause developers to hurry to alternatives like NEAR, Avalanche, and Solana to offer financial services. But unfortunately, they also spend countless hours ensuring their decentralized application is secure, only to wake up and realize bad actors drained millions of dollars of users' funds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the same time, business leaders search the earth for people with the skills needed to build smart contracts and do whatever it takes to find users prepared to put up with the inferior user experiences presented by DeFi apps. Only to be further capped by network congestion and fees.</p>
<p>As we rapidly enter the Web3 era, where value and data quickly move across decentralized platforms with distributed ownership and authority, entrepreneurs and developers need the tools to craft ideas and build quickly, easily, and safely. Moreover, if DeFi is to ever scale beyond crypto natives, developers in Web3 need standardized tools to build applications with user experience at the core.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The argument for better DeFi&nbsp;
<p>Consumer saving and spending arguably power the world. As a result, we, the little guys, control the most critical parts of the global economy and financial system. The internet was all about information, but DeFi is about money - and in a world where cash is power, DeFi flips the model on its head.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most people these days spend and save using a bank, limited by regulatory compliance and further legacy issues. Web3 gives rise to a new way of doing things. New financial products built using smart contracts allow consumers to move between providers in seconds, all from the comfort of a mobile device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DeFi also creates more competition for building financial products by lowering the barrier to entry, sharing a user base between applications, and letting money move instantly and seamlessly between opportunities.</p>
<p>The argument is that decentralized financial programs like Aave, Uniswap, and MakerDAO can directly control assets and allow financial products to operate 24/7, all year round, with 100% uptime and no staff, which will be appealing to end-users if presented in the right way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Sticky points&nbsp;
<p>Arguably the end-user experience of most decentralized apps leaves much to be desired. Blockchain wallets and asset custody, alongside a complex web of transactions and signatures, await beginners, while hardened veterans navigate the space with caution, often making mistakes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the same time, according to DeFi Lama&rsquo;s hack rankings, more than $700m was siphoned out of the crypto space in malicious attacks from the start of October 2022 to date. So if DeFi is to succeed, users must be able to trust and use the services offered in an intuitive, familiar, almost Web2 way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For that to happen, blockchain platforms must provide more incentives for Web2 developers and pioneers to leave a familiar world and embrace Web3. These incentives don't need to be financial but provide builders with the tools to deliver stunning products.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Executives at tech giants like Google, Facebook, and Amazon will likely lead the way, leaving high-profile jobs at market-leading brands to take positions in the promising blockchain space.</p>
<p>Polygon and Circle have hired top talent from tech firms, enticing them with the angle of working on the next big thing in Web3. Further Silicon Valley talent heading for crypto includes Sherice Torres, the former Chief Marketing Officer of Facebook&rsquo;s crypto and payments team, Novi. At the same time, Amazon Cloud executive Pravjit Tiwana joined Gemini as its Chief Technical Officer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Add to this a series of mass layoffs in the tech sector, including Twitter, Amazon, and Meta&rsquo;s dismissal of thousands of workers amidst the highest rates of global inflation seen for decades. This creates an incredible opportunity for businesses that previously wanted to expand their tech and payment capabilities but couldn&rsquo;t because of the shortage of talent available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, blockchain firms can now compete with recruiters from Silicon Valley for the brightest minds with a track record of taking products to market. Arguably, there has never been a better time to think about leaping into Web3 and DeFi development as more powerful tools, and no code solutions come online for those with a solid programming foundation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Playing around proves useful&nbsp;
<p>Gaming, and more importantly, the Unity game engine, led the way regarding the standardization of tools needed to build games. It gave game developers rendering and basic physics engines from which to build&mdash;altogether simplifying the process, lowering the barrier to entry, and making way for innovation and healthy competition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, games got more complex while libraries of reusable art and in-game items became available for other developers to use creatively. As a result, developers, entrepreneurs, and users rushed in. With this straightforward invention of an engine and powerful tools, gaming grew bigger than music, TV, and film combined to become a billion-dollar industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ethereum has by far the most developers in the space, and according to DappRadar, more than 3500 dapps currently run from its smart contracts. The network is also the layer for many cryptocurrencies and blue-chip NFTs. However, as discussed earlier, Ethereum is no longer the sole player in smart contracts and Web3 development.</p>
<p>Moreover, Ethereum doesn't offer developers plug-and-play solutions to build dapps. Instead, developers tend to fork existing applications, as was the case for Sushiswap, a fork of Uniswap. In this scenario, developers often take the bad UX from the forked application, choosing not to improve it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ethereum is simply an industry-standard choice. However, as MySpace fell from its once high perch, and as competition increases and developers focus on end-users, other networks deliver solutions that entice Web2 builders to leap.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
There are solutions&nbsp;
<p>One blockchain stack applying the plug-and-play model outlined by Unity to decentralized finance and Web3 is Radix. The company, with its roots in the United Kingdom, has been working to deliver seamless DeFi for a decade and showcased its Radix Engine, which promises to be the Unity engine of DeFi, at an event called RadFi, where CEO Piers Ridyard laid bare the inefficiencies of DeFi.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right now, crypto, DeFi, and Web3 are just one big glorified tech demo. For everyday people to use it, we've got to improve it radically.&rdquo; Piers Ridyard, CEO of Radix&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the virtual Keynote event, CEO Piers Ridyard also said what differentiates Radix is the fundamental shift in how the platform is built. The network features the world&rsquo;s first programmable DeFi engine that takes concepts such as tokens and vaults and makes them native and fully interoperable. In addition, there&rsquo;s a catalog of tools and pre-made solutions where Web2 developers can find helpful building blocks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Radix engine promises to remove all the complex, low-level work that Web3 and DeFi developers spend 80% of their time on other platforms. Creating a programming language specifically for Web3 and DeFi called Scrypto, Radix hopes to tempt millions of Web2 developers into Web3. But, more importantly, provide them with a soft landing and the ability to build scalable DeFi products.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Radix also claims they studied how bad actors were hacking applications built on public networks like Ethereum. For example, events such as reentrancy attacks, spend approval attacks, or signature manipulation attacks have cost the Ethereum ecosystem millions. The Radix Engine makes many of these attacks impossible, prioritizing asset security as a primary network operation, not an afterthought.</p>
<p>Another Layer-1 blockchain trying to simplify the developer building process is Fuse Network, with its Charge product and Fuse Cash wallet. Charge takes a drag-and-drop approach to DeFi and payment infrastructure, partnering with ecosystem allies and matching them to build on their no-code platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a close focus on everyday payments and DeFi, Fuse and Radix are just a few of many teams out there trying to entice Web2 developers to embrace crypto and DeFi by helping them provide an experience similar to that of Web2 without investing years of study.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Focus where it matters&nbsp;
<p>User experience in DeFi and decentralized apps has arguably suffered as brilliant people worked on the wrong problems. Successful Web3 developers may focus on pushing the boundaries of blockchain technology and the inner workings of finance and tokenomics. Still, it comes at the expense of genuinely usable applications that the mainstream user could adopt and feel safe using.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Solutions like the Radix Engine could profoundly affect the industry and attract Web2 developers to build mobile-first, user-friendly applications delivering DeFi and crypto solutions. In addition, Web2 developers bring a wealth of user onboarding and knowledge that could hold the key to the mass adoption of decentralized applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With tools becoming available Web2 developers can tap into battle-hardened code, spend less time on day-to-day app maintenance and security, and allocate resources to building beautiful applications that work, gain traction, and deliver a smooth user experience. In addition, web2 developers can join and complement the work already done by leading blockchain teams while not having to risk learning complex new programming languages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another thing that attracts Web2 developer talent from big tech companies to Web3 is money. According to data from Blind, a social network for professionals, Coinbase offers as much as $900,000 a year for software engineers. At the same time, the average salary for Web3 developers ranges between $75,000 and $200,000.&nbsp;</p>

Arguably, there has never been a better time to think about leaping into Web3 and DeFi development as more powerful tools, and no code solutions come online for those with a solid programming foundation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Playing around proves useful&nbsp;
<p>Gaming, and more importantly, the Unity game engine, led the way regarding the standardization of tools needed to build games. It gave game developers rendering and basic physics engines from which to build&mdash;altogether simplifying the process, lowering the barrier to entry, and making way for innovation and healthy competition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, games got more complex while libraries of reusable art and in-game items became available for other developers to use creatively. As a result, developers, entrepreneurs, and users rushed in. With this straightforward invention of an engine and powerful tools, gaming grew bigger than music, TV, and film combined to become a billion-dollar industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ethereum has by far the most developers in the space, and according to DappRadar, more than 3500 dapps currently run from its smart contracts. The network is also the layer for many cryptocurrencies and blue-chip NFTs. However, as discussed earlier, Ethereum is no longer the sole player in smart contracts and Web3 development.</p>
<p>Moreover, Ethereum doesn't offer developers plug-and-play solutions to build dapps. Instead, developers tend to fork existing applications, as was the case for Sushiswap, a fork of Uniswap. In this scenario, developers often take the bad UX from the forked application, choosing not to improve it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ethereum is simply an industry-standard choice. However, as MySpace fell from its once high perch, and as competition increases and developers focus on end-users, other networks deliver solutions that entice Web2 builders to leap.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
There are solutions&nbsp;
<p>One blockchain stack applying the plug-and-play model outlined by Unity to decentralized finance and Web3 is Radix. The company, with its roots in the United Kingdom, has been working to deliver seamless DeFi for a decade and showcased its Radix Engine, which promises to be the Unity engine of DeFi, at an event called RadFi, where CEO Piers Ridyard laid bare the inefficiencies of DeFi.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right now, crypto, DeFi, and Web3 are just one big glorified tech demo. For everyday people to use it, we've got to improve it radically.&rdquo; Piers Ridyard, CEO of Radix&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the virtual Keynote event, CEO Piers Ridyard also said what differentiates Radix is the fundamental shift in how the platform is built. The network features the world&rsquo;s first programmable DeFi engine that takes concepts such as tokens and vaults and makes them native and fully interoperable. In addition, there&rsquo;s a catalog of tools and pre-made solutions where Web2 developers can find helpful building blocks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Radix engine promises to remove all the complex, low-level work that Web3 and DeFi developers spend 80% of their time on other platforms. Creating a programming language specifically for Web3 and DeFi called Scrypto, Radix hopes to tempt millions of Web2 developers into Web3. But, more importantly, provide them with a soft landing and the ability to build scalable DeFi products.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Radix also claims they studied how bad actors were hacking applications built on public networks like Ethereum. For example, events such as reentrancy attacks, spend approval attacks, or signature manipulation attacks have cost the Ethereum ecosystem millions. The Radix Engine makes many of these attacks impossible, prioritizing asset security as a primary network operation, not an afterthought.</p>
<p>Another Layer-1 blockchain trying to simplify the developer building process is Fuse Network, with its Charge product and Fuse Cash wallet. Charge takes a drag-and-drop approach to DeFi and payment infrastructure, partnering with ecosystem allies and matching them to build on their no-code platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a close focus on everyday payments and DeFi, Fuse and Radix are just a few of many teams out there trying to entice Web2 developers to embrace crypto and DeFi by helping them provide an experience similar to that of Web2 without investing years of study.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Focus where it matters&nbsp;
<p>User experience in DeFi and decentralized apps has arguably suffered as brilliant people worked on the wrong problems. Successful Web3 developers may focus on pushing the boundaries of blockchain technology and the inner workings of finance and tokenomics. Still, it comes at the expense of genuinely usable applications that the mainstream user could adopt and feel safe using.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Solutions like the Radix Engine could profoundly affect the industry and attract Web2 developers to build mobile-first, user-friendly applications delivering DeFi and crypto solutions. In addition, Web2 developers bring a wealth of user onboarding and knowledge that could hold the key to the mass adoption of decentralized applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With tools becoming available Web2 developers can tap into battle-hardened code, spend less time on day-to-day app maintenance and security, and allocate resources to building beautiful applications that work, gain traction, and deliver a smooth user experience. In addition, web2 developers can join and complement the work already done by leading blockchain teams while not having to risk learning complex new programming languages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another thing that attracts Web2 developer talent from big tech companies to Web3 is money. According to data from Blind, a social network for professionals, Coinbase offers as much as $900,000 a year for software engineers. At the same time, the average salary for Web3 developers ranges between $75,000 and $200,000.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>INTERNET CITY, DUBAI, 9th December, 2022, Chainwire</p><p>LBank Exchange, a global digital asset trading platform, has listed SILK on December 9, 2022. For all users of LBank Exchange, the SILK/USDT trading pair is now officially available for trading.</p>
<p>As the first web3 esports with earnings, Spider Tanks enables players to earn for their play through its complex and brilliantly designed reward economy. Its native token SILK was listed on LBank Exchange at 13:00 UTC on December 9, 2022, to further expand its global reach and help it achieve its vision.</p>
<p>Introducing Spider Tanks</p>
<p>Spider Tanks is a blockchain-based PVP brawler created by award-winning Netherlands based GAMEDIA and brought to players by Gala Games. Players choose between a number of Tank Bodies and Weapons in the garage, then battle it out in one of the many Spider Tanks arena maps. And since all tank parts are owned as NFTs, they can be upgraded, then sold on the secondary market at any time the player chooses.</p>
<p>Different game modes of Spider Tanks present different strategic and team-based challenges to always keep gameplay fresh. TEAM DEATHMATCH is an all-out brawl style match where the team with the most kills gets the victory. Players need to create killer destructive combinations with their teams, and let the chaos ensure. CAPTURE THE CHICKEN is a mode where the player&rsquo;s team's goal is to capture as many moving chickens as possible and become a Spider Tanks chicken master. And in CAPTURE THE FLAG, the team who holds the only one flag in their possession the longest will be victorious in the match.</p>
<p>Spider Tanks is free to play, but also incorporates a variety of play-to-earn mechanics, centering around skill-based competition, resource collection, and a player-driven upgrade cycle. It builds an ecosystem where a web of participants including NFT holders, players, and game developers revolves around playing Spider Tanks matches and receiving Victory Points that can be submitted for game token reward distribution.</p>
<p>Whether the player wants to play with a small group of close friends, or tests their skills in high-stakes competition, Spider Tanks will be the worldwide play-to-earn esports for them. Players can enjoy the free to play game or compete with other players by purchasing fully tradable Weapons, Tanks and Bodies in the Spider Tanks store for advantages to the upgrade cycle, rarity head starts and more.</p>
<p>About SILK Token</p>
<p>Based on ERC-20, SILK is the game token of Spider Tanks ecosystem. It can be acquired by involving oneself in the Spider Tanks ecosystem through playing and winning games, as well as by operating nodes and other ecosystem products. SILK can also be spent in a number of ways, the chief of which is purchasing upgrades for a Tank Item NFT.</p>
<p>SILK will always be the only currency of the Spider Tanks ecosystem, and as that ecosystem grows in size, supply will not increase in-kind. With a soft cap of 100 million (i.e., 100,000,000) tokens, SILK's economy is tied to the amount of players, SILK being generated, and SILK being spent and adjusting emission rates automatically.</p>
<p>The SILK token was listed on LBank Exchange at 13:00 UTC on December 9, 2022, investors who are interested in the Spider Tanks investment can easily buy and sell SILK token on LBank Exchange now. The listing of SILK token on LBank Exchange will undoubtedly help it further expand its business and draw more attention in the market.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Cross-chain bridge Nomad has announced that it is preparing to relaunch its bridge and offer partial refunds to users impacted by the hack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nomad suffered a crippling hack in August when malicious actors discovered and exploited a loophole in Nomad&rsquo;s smart contracts.&nbsp;</p>
Relaunch And Reimburse&nbsp;
<p>The Nomad cross-chain bridge has announced that it is preparing to relaunch its bridge and reimburse users that lost funds during the $190 million exploit that took place earlier in the year. The Nomad team announced the launch of its relaunch guide after it fixed the smart contract vulnerability that hackers exploited to orchestrate the August hack. In a Medium post, the team stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since the Nomad Token Bridge hack, the team has been working hard on recovering funds and making the necessary updates to safely relaunch the Nomad Token Bridge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to Nomad, the protocol would allow users to bridge back their madAssets, and access a pro-rata share of the recovered funds. The company also implemented a redesign for the token bridge, without which, according to the company, the &ldquo;first people to bridge back their madAssets would receive canonical tokens on a one-to-one basis until there were no canonical tokens left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an attempt to avoid this first-come, first-serve approach, Nomad implemented several changes in the protocol and gave users the ability to bridge back, access a portion of the recovered funds, and ensure that the tokens accessed are in the original token, providing impacted users with a mechanism to access any funds recovered in future. Nomad added,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Given the scope of these changes, a full audit of the smart contracts was completed along with an additional re-review of any remediations with our auditors.&rdquo;</p>

Verification Process Open&nbsp;
<p>Nomad also asked its users to go through and comply with all Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations through CoinList, a centralized exchange and launchpad, to receive their reimbursed funds. The team stated that KYC was essential to ensure that all payments were in line with compliance norms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the verification process is completed, users will receive a special NFT that will grant them access to a proportional share of the recovered funds on the Ethereum blockchain. The NFTs will be non-transferable and allow holders to receive any other funds that are recovered in the future.&nbsp;</p>
The Nomad Bridge Hack&nbsp;
<p>Nomad&rsquo;s cross-chain bridge allows users to move assets across Ethereum, Avalanche, Moonbeam, and Evmos blockchains. In August, malicious actors discovered a security vulnerability in Nomad&rsquo;s smart contracts, which enabled them to steal funds through dubious transactions. An analysis of the hack revealed that the original hackers were joined by hundreds of copycat hackers, using the same vulnerability, but modifying the recipient address, token amount, and target tokens.</p>
<p>The hack resulted from a faulty software update initiated by the Nomad developers, which allowed anyone to drain funds from the protocol. The hack resulted in $190 million being stolen from Nomad, making it one of the biggest crypto hacks of 2022. As of August, Nomad had managed to recover almost $37 million from the stolen funds with help from ethical hackers, with the company still asking hackers to return the stolen tokens.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Tests 16960 Technical Resistance:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 9 December 2022</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) looked to add to marginal gains early in the Asian session as the pair appreciated to the 16959.63 level after buying pressure emerged around the 16738 area, with the intraday high representing a test of the 23.6% retracement of the recent appreciating range from 15460 to 17424.59.&nbsp; Stops were elected below the 16877 and 16708 levels during the recent pullback, representing the 38.2% and 50% retracements of the recent appreciating range from 15992.64 to 17424.59.&nbsp; Additional downside retracement levels in these recent appreciating ranges include the 16539, 16442, 16330, 16299, 16210, 15923, and 15880 levels.&nbsp; If recent downside momentum accelerates, traders may test recent two-year lows around the 15460 level established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area, a previous relative low that represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Associated downside price objectives below current price activity include the 13369, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Technicians continue to eye the 14500.15 and 10432.73 areas as major downside targets, and additional downside price objectives include the 14613, 10727, and 9682 levels, areas that are related to selling pressure that intensified around the 20894.96 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; If BTC/USD is able to resume its upward trajectory, upside areas of potential technical resistance and selling pressure include the 17791, 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 200-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;100-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and below the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 16991.83 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 16887.11.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;14500.15/ 13369.11/ 10727.75 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;18495.40/ 19199.48/ 20070.64 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bearishly below MACDAverage.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bullishly above MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>It's no secret that the cryptocurrency market is in a bear run. However, this doesn't mean that all cryptocurrencies are doomed. In fact, there are three specific cryptos that have the potential to trigger the next bull run: Orbeon Protocol (ORBN), Litecoin (LTC), and Ethereum (ETH).Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is already seeing a surge in prices during phase 2 of the public presale and prices are currently up 525% since its initial release.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s9">Orbeon Protocol (ORBN)</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is a blockchain-based crowdfunding launchpad that provides an opportunity for startups to raise funds from a global, distributed investor base quickly and securely. For investors, it means they can access high-quality projects with the potential for big returns.</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) offers equity-based NFTs to investors, with returns that come from the asset's appreciation. As these NFTs are fractionalized, investors can purchase small amounts of equity-based tokens without needing to commit a large amount of capital.</p>
<p>There's no need for brokers, bankers, or other middlemen, and Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) eliminates the need for complex paperwork. Smart contracts replace traditional paper contracts and reduce the amount of time it takes to issue financial instruments.</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) also has an innovative governance model that uses ORBN tokens to help prevent fraud and vote on decisions. These tokens are also used for staking, accessing startup funding rounds, trading fee discounts, and more.</p>
<p>The excitement grows with each phase of public presale, with phase 2 about to sell out at any moment now. If Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) can meet its goals and exceed expectations, it could revolutionize the crowdfunding industry and explode in 2023, with analysts already projecting current end of year prices for Orbeon Protocol to reach $0.24, an increase of 6000%.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s9">Litecoin (LTC)</p>
<p>Litecoin (LTC) is the silver to Bitcoin's gold. Litecoin (LTC) was created by Charlie Lee in 2011 as a faster and cheaper alternative to Bitcoin. Since then, Litecoin has remained one of the mainstays of the cryptocurrency market, with a current market capitalization of over $5 billion.</p>
<p>Litecoin (LTC) adheres to many of the same cryptocurrency principles as Bitcoin, such as proof-of-work consensus and open-source development. However, Litecoin has addressed some of Bitcoin's shortcomings, with shorter transaction times and lower transaction fees.</p>
<p>But the reason why Litecoin (LTC) may trigger the next bull run lies in the halving that is scheduled to take place in 2023. This event has a strong history of driving up the price of Litecoin (LTC) and could be instrumental in triggering a bull run.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s9">Ethereum (ETH)</p>
<p>Ethereum (ETH) is a cryptocurrency that completely changed the game. Ethereum (ETH) was not just a currency, but a platform for building decentralized applications and smart contracts. This enabled developers to create new protocols to transact their digital assets without the need for middlemen or third-party gateways.</p>
<p>Ethereum (ETH) has experienced strong growth since its inception in 2015, with its current market capitalization surpassing $150 billion. This growth can be attributed to the increasing number of decentralized applications being built on top of Ethereum (ETH).</p>
<p>But with such a larger market cap, how can Ethereum (ETH) possibly trigger a bull run? The answer lies in the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, which is expected to reduce transaction fees and speed up transaction times.</p>
<p>As companies shift their focus to blockchain technology, Ethereum (ETH) could see a surge in prices as the demand for its blockchain technology rises. This could be the spark that sets off a bull run across the entire crypto market.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>A United States court has ordered the bankrupt crypto company Celsius to refund its customers with crypto assets worth $44 million.&nbsp;</p>
Judge Orders Crypto Returns
<p>The crypto lender, which announced its bankruptcy in July 2022, has been ordered by the Chief Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn to return millions of dollars of crypto funds to its users. The firm has been directed to refund its users the crypto assets worth $44 dollars in September.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the ruling, Judge Glenn reportedly stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want this case to move forward. I want creditors to recover as much as they possibly can as soon as they possibly can.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In other news, the company has successfully appealed to the court to extend its exclusivity period till February 15, 2023, by which it has the monopoly to submit the company reorganization plans under the Chapter 11 guidelines. At the time of bankruptcy filing, the Celsius team had announced that its liabilities were between $1 billion and $10 billion, with over 100,000 creditors.</p>
Escrow Funds Belong To Customers
<p>A report claimed that Celsius held over $200 million in assets in escrow. However, the firm reportedly moved most of these funds (around $200,000) from interest-bearing to escrow accounts shortly before the bankruptcy filing. According to the preferential transfer rules, this could have given them the option to claim ownership of the funds in the custody accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, now according to the court order, the funds held in escrow accounts must also be returned to the customers, even if they did not enter the company&rsquo;s interest-bearing accounts. The court order came after Celsius advisors and stakeholders determined that the funds held in the custody accounts belonged to the customers, not Celsius.&nbsp;</p>
Executives More Eager To Fill Own Pockets
<p>There has been quite some uncertainty regarding the funds held by Celsius, even after its bankruptcy filing. Several high-level executives were accused of filling their pockets instead of thinking about the community. Ex-CEO Alex Mashinsky has been a chief target of these allegations. In early October, reports broke that Mashinsky had withdrawn $10 million from the platform. Immediately after, Celsius froze all user accounts and transactions while still claiming that user funds were safe. Two other top executives were accused of allegedly stealing user funds a couple of days after this news broke. Former CSO Daniel Leon and CTO Nuke Goldstein reportedly withdrew $56 million along with Mashinsky just before the company filed for bankruptcy. The fact that all three top executives had put their own interests before the community has been a point of contention for the community and has led to a general feeling of ill will, especially towards the disgraced former CEO himself.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Singapore, Singapore, 8th December, 2022, Chainwire</p><p>&nbsp;DeFiChain, the world&rsquo;s leading blockchain on the Bitcoin network dedicated to bringing decentralized financial applications to everyone, has officially activated the much-anticipated Grand Central hard fork on its network at 01 AM EST on Thursday, December 8th on Block Height 2,479,000.</p>
<p>The Grand Central hard fork is one of the biggest and most monumental updates for DeFiChain in 2022. It marks the rollout of four main features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>On-chain governance</li>
  <li>Token consortium framework</li>
  <li>Support for masternode parameter updates (owner, operator, reward address)</li>
  <li>Pool commission and reward fixes
</li>
</ul>
<p>This hard fork addresses some of the long-awaited product debt and prepares the DeFiChain community for an accelerated growth in 2023. </p>
<p>U-Zyn Chua, Co-Founder of DeFiChain, said, &ldquo;Grand Central marks a major step in DeFiChain&rsquo;s governance structure since it is implementing on-chain governance. This makes the voting processes perfectly transparent, easier and strengthens the governance structure of DeFiChain. A major step for the whole ecosystem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On-chain governance</p>
<p>To make changes in the DeFiChain ecosystem, community members can submit three types of proposals to be voted on by masternode owners:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Community development fund request proposal (also known as Community Fund Proposal; CFP)</li>
  <li>Vote of confidence (also known as DeFiChain Improvement Proposal; DFIP)</li>
  <li>Block reward reallocation proposal
</li>
</ol>
<p>Currently, the process of creating a proposal and voting is largely done off-chain. With On-Chain Governance (OCG), any proposal which requires voting by community can be conducted directly on the blockchain. It will strengthen DeFiChain&rsquo;s governance structure and ensure that there is complete transparency in the entire voting process for the DeFiChain community.</p>
<p>The voting results will now be available real-time on a dashboard on defiscan.live, which makes tracking the results much easier. For masternode owners, they will be able to generate a script to vote for each proposal via the dashboard, reducing the effort required for voting. Overall, this would result in higher levels of participation in the voting of proposals.</p>
<p>DeFiChain Consortium</p>
<p>In DeFiChain, tokenized digital assets are meant to be backed 1:1 by the actual asset in its respective ecosystem (e.g. one dBTC being backed by one BTC). However, this backing is currently not enforceable via the blockchain. The DeFiChain Consortium will give a proper structure to the backing of dAssets to ensure that all digital assets are backed.</p>
<p>Members of the Consortium (e.g Cake DeFi) will have their own dedicated key for the minting and burning of tokenized digital assets. Each member is required to back any digital assets they mint, regardless of whether they are minting for themselves or on behalf of users of their platform. </p>
<p>The Consortium members will also be required to pledge two days worth of collateral, in DFI or DUSD, that will be locked up in a smart contract. It is required on top of the backing of the tokenized digital assets. This collateral will determine how many digital assets a member can mint each day.</p>
<p>This additional collateral is meant to deter members from engaging in activities that are contrary to the interests of the community, and to pay for damages in the event where a member overmints digital assets or is unable to provide backing for tokenized digital assets.</p>
<p>The formation of the Consortium will enhance the governance structure and transparency in the DeFiChain community. It also provides a mechanism for the community to monitor the backing of tokenized digital assets, which deters overminting.</p>
About DeFiChain

It is dedicated to enabling fast, intelligent, and transparent decentralized financial services. DeFiChain offers liquidity mining, staking, decentralized assets, and decentralized loans. The DeFiChain Foundation's mission is to bring DeFi to the Bitcoin ecosystem.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>CasinosBlockchain.io has prepared a helpful assortment of the most recent Bitcoin casino statistics through which readers can learn how many crypto casinos are available, how much Bitcoin gamblers have already wagered, and plenty more relevant information regarding this popular industry.</p>
<p>Moreover, Casinos Blockchain analyzes the future of crypto gambling and answers a few FAQs to make sure readers know everything there is to know about Bitcoin casinos before getting involved, including both the risks and benefits.</p>
<p>What are some of the top Bitcoin casino statistics?</p>
<p>Gambling has been a popular way to pass the time for many centuries, and it is no different today. However, thanks to the advent and subsequent implementation of innovative technologies like cryptocurrencies, &lsquo;Bitcoin gambling&rsquo; has become exceedingly popular to the point that since 2014, players have actually wagered over $4.5 billion in Bitcoin to date. The global casino industry itself is worth more than $231 billion as of the time of this writing.</p>
<p>Moreover, approximately 60% of all Bitcoin transactions are related to gambling in some way, shape or form. What is even more mindblowing is that crypto gamblers place 337 bets every single second, and that these gamblers bet $3 million worth of crypto on a daily basis. The most popular cryptocurrencies for gambling purposes were observed to be Bitcoin and Ethereum, although these are not the only choices that gamblers have as using other altcoins like Litecoin may yield better results.</p>
<p>Why does this matter?</p>
<p>Despite the fact that land-based casinos and casino resorts suffered significant setbacks as a result of the pandemic and other factors such as inflation, the gambling sector as a whole nevertheless continued to thrive as a substantial portion of players made the shift to online gambling. Furthermore, the casino market is predicted to grow in the coming years. To that end, the revenue of brick-and-mortar casinos in the United States is expected to increase year on year from 2021 to 2024 and experts view this is a key indicator of the projected growth for the casino market.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned that although online casinos are becoming more popular on a global scale, it will surely take some time before they become as popular in the United States, given that many states in the country have yet to legalize online casinos and a sizable portion tend to operate without a license.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Straits Research predicts that the global online gambling market will reach $153 billion by the end of 2030, growing at a CAGR of 11.7% during the analysis period. Outside of the United States, Europe has the biggest market share, and it is expected to grow at a 12% CAGR between 2021 and 2030. In addition, the Asia-Pacific region is expected to grow faster than Europe, with a CAGR of 12.8%, and to reach $50 billion by 2030.</p>
<p>Where does crypto fit into all this?</p>
<p>Crypto gambling is leading the way in the online gambling industry. Of course, Bitcoin can be used for other purposes like buying NFTs, cars, real estate, and even insurance. Still, the majority of Bitcoin transactions take place in crypto casinos. The most recent Bitcoin gambling statistics therefore indicate that interest in crypto gambling is growing as players continue to prefer cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin over traditional fiat currencies.</p>
<p>Although exact figures are difficult to obtain, the global crypto gambling market is estimated to be worth a quarter of a billion dollars by Crypto Wisser. Moreover, as the amount of hybrid casinos grows, the global crypto gambling market is similarly expected to grow in value over time and as an increasing number of people and businesses adopt crypto which many big names like Microsoft, PayPal, Home Depot, and Starbucks already have.</p>
<p>Crypto gamblers placed just about three billion crypto-based bets in the first quarter of 2021, according to the most recent Bitcoin casino statistics for 2022. During the same time period, the quantity of these bets increased by 116% to reach over six billion. In fact, within the first quarter of 2022, cryptocurrencies accounted for approximately 36% % of all bets in general. Most crypto gamblers also prefer to play on their smartphones due to the portability aspect.</p>
<p>Is crypto gambling safe and where does it go from here?</p>
<p>Provably fair games are available at approximately 77.6% of crypto casinos. These games enhance the transparency of crypto casinos which is in stark contrast to traditional casino games, as a provably fair game enables users to verify the outcome of each hand or round played. As a result, provably fair games are frequently preferred among crypto gamblers who value safety and transparency.</p>
<p>Also, casino operators can use blockchain technology to access features that are not available in traditional casinos. For instance, crypto casinos could operate at lower costs, with improved security, and with faster withdrawal speeds, just to name a few advantages. The best part about crypto gambling, however, is that blockchain technology has a lot of untapped potential. With all the interest surrounding other emerging technologies nowadays such as NFTs, the metaverse, VR and AR, the sky could well and truly be the limit for this immensely popular industry.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Congressman Ritchie Torres has written a letter to the Government Accountability Office calling for an investigation into the SEC handling of FTX.</p>
<p>With the very public collapse and ensuing loss of investor funds, the FTX debacle is one of the biggest losses in crypto thus far. Could the Securities and Exchange Commission and its chairman Gary Gensler have done more to prevent such an occurrence?</p>
<p>Democratic representative Ritchie Torres certainly thinks so, and he has written a letter to the Government Accountability Office asking it to look into the conduct of Gensler&rsquo;s agency in relation to FTX, stating that the crash could have been avoided had the SEC intervened in a timely manner.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">NEW this morning &mdash; Rep. @RitchieTorres (D-NY) calls on the Government Accountability Office (@USGAO) to investigate the SEC&rsquo;s &ldquo;failure to protect the investing public from the egregious mismanagement and malfeasance of @FTX_Official&rdquo; pic.twitter.com/BdT7ZVCM7X</p>
&mdash; Alexander Grieve (@AlexanderGrieve) December 7, 2022
<p>

</p>
<p>In the letter, Congressman Torres highlights what he says was the failure of the SEC to protect the investing public from billions of dollars in losses from the &ldquo;egregious mismanagement and malfeasance of FTX.&rdquo; He wrote:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chair Gary Gensler, by the logic of his own public pronouncements, is singularly responsible for the regulatory failures surrounding the collapse of FTX, and its affiliate FTX US. Chair Gensler has said on countless occasions that there is no need for authorizing legislation from Congress: the SEC presently possesses the authority it needs to regulate cryptocurrency exchanges.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He added:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the SEC has the authority Mr Gensler claims, why did he fail to uncover the largest crypto Ponzi scheme in US history?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Congressman Torres went on to accuse the SEC of dedicating &ldquo;scarce time and resources&rdquo; in investigating Kim Kardashian rather than crypto exchanges. In this regard he charged the agency with seeking publicity at the expense of protecting the investing public.</p>
<p>The Congressman ended the letter by referring to the &ldquo;fundamentally demoralized&rdquo; career staff at the SEC who, according to the SEC Inspector General, had suffered the &ldquo;highest attrition rate in a decade.&rdquo; Torres asked to what extent Gensler&rsquo;s demoralization of his workforce had contributed to the agency&rsquo;s duty to protect investors.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>As the European Central Bank prepares to issue its digital currency, executive member Fabio Panetta gives a speech based on trying to dissuade the public from investing in cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>A keynote speech by Fabio Panetta, member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, concentrated solely on describing what in his view are the fundamental flaws to be found in cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Panetta lays out what he perceives as the risks in three fundamental flaws.</p>
Unbacked crypto-assets offer no benefits to society
<p>The first perceived flaw is that crypto assets do not perform any useful function for society. Panetta states that they aren&rsquo;t used for payments, they don&rsquo;t fund consumption, they don&rsquo;t help fuel production, and they don&rsquo;t help to combat climate change.</p>
<p>He complains that cryptocurrencies aren&rsquo;t backed, they are volatile, and they are unstable. He says that they are &ldquo;notional instruments&rdquo; and have no value for investors that buy them.</p>
<p>Panetta states that there is no compensation for investors and highlights the significant losses from various collapses. He says that there are no insurance schemes and there is little protection from cyber risks.</p>
Stablecoins are exposed to runs&nbsp;
<p>Panetta posits that stablecoins are stable in name only. He says that they are supposed to provide stability by having their value tied to a portfolio of assets.</p>
<p>There then follows a section on algorithmic stablecoins, and of course the TerraUSD algorithmic stablecoin is highlighted.</p>
Crypto markets are highly leveraged and interconnected
<p>Panetta makes the point that crypto markets can have extremely high leverage, creating &ldquo;strong procyclical effects&rdquo; where shocks aren&rsquo;t easily absorbed.</p>
<p>He points the finger at DeFi, where he says the procyclical effects are amplified by the overcollateralization common in DeFi. He says that the flaws are magnified by inadequate governance, and insufficient transparency and disclosure.</p>
Regulation and CBDCs
<p>Panetta then goes on to basically say that crypto will only endure as long as investors are looking for a place to gamble. In order to minimise this he recommends that they are regulated and that they do not receive &ldquo;preferential treatment&rdquo;.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the European Central Bank prepares to issue its digital currency, executive member Fabio Panetta gives a speech based on trying to dissuade the public from investing in cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>A keynote speech by Fabio Panetta, member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, concentrated solely on describing what in his view are the fundamental flaws to be found in cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Panetta lays out what he perceives as the risks in three fundamental flaws.</p>
Unbacked crypto-assets offer no benefits to society
<p>The first perceived flaw is that crypto assets do not perform any useful function for society. Panetta states that they aren&rsquo;t used for payments, they don&rsquo;t fund consumption, they don&rsquo;t help fuel production, and they don&rsquo;t help to combat climate change.</p>
<p>He complains that cryptocurrencies aren&rsquo;t backed, they are volatile, and they are unstable. He says that they are &ldquo;notional instruments&rdquo; and have no value for investors that buy them.</p>
<p>Panetta states that there is no compensation for investors and highlights the significant losses from various collapses. He says that there are no insurance schemes and there is little protection from cyber risks.</p>
Stablecoins are exposed to runs&nbsp;
<p>Panetta posits that stablecoins are stable in name only. He says that they are supposed to provide stability by having their value tied to a portfolio of assets.</p>
<p>There then follows a section on algorithmic stablecoins, and of course the TerraUSD algorithmic stablecoin is highlighted.</p>
Crypto markets are highly leveraged and interconnected
<p>Panetta makes the point that crypto markets can have extremely high leverage, creating &ldquo;strong procyclical effects&rdquo; where shocks aren&rsquo;t easily absorbed.</p>
<p>He points the finger at DeFi, where he says the procyclical effects are amplified by the overcollateralization common in DeFi. He says that the flaws are magnified by inadequate governance, and insufficient transparency and disclosure.</p>
Regulation and CBDCs
<p>Panetta then goes on to basically say that crypto will only endure as long as investors are looking for a place to gamble. In order to minimise this he recommends that they are regulated and that they do not receive &ldquo;preferential treatment&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He says that &ldquo;regulators must walk a tightrope&rdquo; and avoid allowing unsound cryptos from &ldquo;socialising the risks through bailouts&rdquo;. He welcomes the EU incoming MiCA regulations and states that it is crucial they enter into force rapidly.</p>
<p>The rest of the review lays out the case for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), which in his view will be the only &ldquo;anchor of stability&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He concludes with a call for urgent global regulation in order to protect consumers, and to reduce the contagion risk of stablecoins, and signs off with the following paragraph:</p>

<p>&ldquo;regulation will not turn risky instruments into safe money. Instead, a stable digital finance ecosystem requires well-supervised intermediaries and a risk-free and dependable digital settlement asset, which only digital central bank money can provide.&rdquo;</p>
