            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Francois Villeroy de Galhau &#8211; Governor of Banque de France &#8211; believes cryptocurrency firms should obtain tougher regulatory licenses to continue providing their services.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He also stated France should introduce stricter rules for domestic digital asset entities as soon as it is ready with its legislation instead of waiting for other European countries. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Villeroy&#8217;s Latest Recommendation</span></h2>
<p><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.banque-france.fr/en/intervention/new-year-wishes-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to the central banker, cryptocurrency entities should secure more stringent authorization from watchdogs than the existing ones due to the current &#8220;unstable environment.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Around 60 organizations, including Binance, have received registration from The Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) to offer their products and services in the European nation. However, none have the license Villeroy urges for. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Governor maintained that the recent chaos in the world of crypto, which saw numerous bankruptcies, investor interest outflow, and a market decline, is the main reason why France should speed up with such amendments:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;The disruption seen in 2022 is nourishing one basic conviction: France should switch as soon as possible to the compulsory authorization of DASPs (digital asset service providers) rather than simply requiring their registration. And this needs to happen well before MiCA enters into force to create the necessary framework of trust.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It will specifically focus on combating tax evasion and money laundering and could go into effect in 2024. </span></p>

<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Whether it is digital currencies or payments, we in Europe must be ready to act as quickly as necessary or take the risk of an erosion of our monetary sovereignty.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He also said the EU has one or two years to introduce such legislation, or the continent could &#8220;lose its momentum.&#8221; Villeroy aired his thoughts in the summer of 2021, meaning that the potential bill might occur in the following months (assuming European watchdogs consider his recommendation).</span></p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Michigan Senator Debbie Stabenow announced she will abandon her post in January 2025.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The politician was one of the creators of cryptocurrency legislation that could empower the CFTC with exclusive jurisdiction when overseeing the market. Interestingly, the former CEO of FTX &#8211; Sam Bankman-Fried &#8211; was a vocal supporter of the bill, which received the nickname: &#8220;the SBF crypto bill.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">She said her main focus throughout the next two years will be the well-being of the locals and creating job opportunities in the urban and rural communities.

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">She cooperated with Senators John Boozman, Cory Booker, and John Thune in August last year to submit the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act. The potential bill aims to give the CFTC greater authority when monitoring the cryptocurrency sector and thus protect consumers from fraud.

			            <description><![CDATA[The DCG Group, who are reportedly having trouble staying afloat, seem to be cutting off ballast wherever they can.
]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, the DCG Group – a conglomerate that manages Genesis, Grayscale, and wealth management service HQ – announced a 30% workforce reduction as the shadow of bankruptcy looms over the battered crypto broker.</p>
<p>DCG has been in trouble for a while now, with partnered services <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitvavo-claims-dcg-has-liquidity-issues-exchange-funds-unaffected/" data-wpel-link="internal">distancing</a> themselves from any possible fallout.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it seems that problems are piling up at DCG as one division after another begins to fold.</p>
<h2>Closed for Winter</h2>
<p>The concerning <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/dcg-shuts-down-wealth-management-031136907.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">announcement</a> regarding Genesis’s workforce reduction and possible bankruptcy was soon followed by another one regarding sister company “HQ.”</p>
<p>According to a spokesperson for the company, HQ will be halting all activity as of January 31, although it will consider re-opening the branch in the future.</p>
<p>The shutdown of HQ is blamed on the broader financial situation – and, naturally, on the ongoing crypto winter.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Due to the state of the broader economic environment and prolonged crypto winter presenting significant headwinds to the industry, we made the decision to wind down HQ, effective January 31, 2023. We’re proud of the work that the team has done and look forward to potentially revisiting the project in the future.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The first cracks started to show in November when DCG CEO Barry Silbert advised investors that 2022 revenues will be lower than expected. At the time, Genesis – who had already laid off 20% of their workforce in August – owed about $575 million to parent company DCG.</p>
<p>To further compound the terrible financial position Genesis and DCG were in, Bitvavo alone claimed to be owed about $300 million by DCG, who allegedly shunted the blame onto Genesis alone.</p>
<h2>Investors and Partners Left Perplexed</h2>
<p>As <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/genesis-parent-company-dcg-shutters-its-wealth-management-division" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">reported</a> by The Information, HQ was still managing about $3.5 billion worth of assets as recently as December, in spite of the crypto winter. As a result, partners and investors were allegedly stunned by the decision, claiming it came completely out of the left field.</p>
<p>Although the DCG group hints at the implosion of 3AC and FTX as culprits for its own woes – claiming that its assets were lost when withdrawals from the two defunct crypto platforms were stopped – the responsibility for liquidity issues should never be passed on to someone else. Had proper due diligence been carried out, the situation at DCG would probably be very different.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[BONK saw significant loss in its value after the burning event. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The development team behind the Solana-based memecoin project &#8211; Bonk Inu (BONK) &#8211; has revealed burning over 5 trillion tokens, or 5% of the total supply.</p>
<p>The blockchain <a href="https://solscan.io/tx/3QPerPyNBrkmfkEEPmcTg4f7G5KHpxskDL3zcNyLvpuLcMgCnEPfezL43gaWpFnNc8fX6zYqwx3mFmJ2pmGbnvxS" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">data</a> confirmed the process, which saw nearly $1 million worth of BONK removed from circulation.</p>
<ul>
<li>As a result, BONK’s circulating supply declined by 5% to 94.16 trillion. Updating the same, the devs <a href="https://twitter.com/bonk_inu/status/1611133296955498498?t=DBPAfQkeGg1e_E9mvS36cg&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">tweeted</a>,</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;BONK represents the best of Solana. Our community is working together across the ecosystem to make positive change for all of us. The 5 Trillion $BONK tokens allocated to “The Team” have been burned.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>BONK has managed to garner support from both centralized exchanges and decentralized applications over the past day, such as Gate.io and CremaFinance.</li>
<li>Other Solana-based NFT marketplaces and gaming sites have also introduced bonk-based trading events and mints, further boosting the meme coin&#8217;s utility for holders and investors.</li>
<li>In a span of less than two weeks, the Bonk ecosystem has raked in over 50 integrations.</li>
<li>Further data <a href="https://twitter.com/bonk_inu/status/1611242228961185798?t=K_hvZT55cNOiHJnFevr4uw&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">showed</a> that BONK saw three million transactions over the past three days, demonstrating active participation from holders, which surpassed that of Ethereum as well.</li>
<li>As of January 6th, the unique <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/what-is-bonk-inu-bonk-the-dogecoin-of-solana/" data-wpel-link="internal">BONK</a> holding wallets increased to more than 86,000 from below 25,000 at the beginning of this week.</li>
<li>Token burning is a process in which a major portion of coins is removed or &#8220;burned&#8221; from circulation indefinitely. This move essentially creates an imbalance in relation to demand that triggers an upward price action of the token because of the asset’s increased scarcity.</li>
<li>However, BONK has defied the norm and instead lost more than 56% of its value over the past day and was currently trading at $0.000001512, suggesting investors pocketed significant profits as crypto platforms launched bonk futures, enabling traders to bet against the token.</li>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission has reportedly asked some FTX investors whether they conducted proper research on the cryptocurrency exchange before becoming its clients.</p>
<p>Recall that the platform (considered among the giants in its field) crashed in November, causing multi-billion losses and shaking the entire market to its core.</p>

<li>The SEC&#8217;s inquiry aims to determine the investors&#8217; incentive to choose the crypto platform and whether they followed any strategies at all.</li>
<li>The examination does not mean those companies are targets of the investigation against FTX and its former CEO &#8211; Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF).</li>
<li>However, it could indicate that investment funds and venture capital firms exposed to the exchange could become a subject of regulatory scrutiny despite being viewed as victims of the alleged scam.</li>
<li>US authorities previously sought information from investors of FTX regarding their dialogue with the company&#8217;s bosses.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/the-fall-of-sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-empire-a-timeline-of-ftxs-collapse/" data-wpel-link="internal">demise</a> of the trading venue is among the darkest events ever in crypto&#8217;s history. The organization, once valued at $32 billion, experienced severe liquidity issues in November and failed to honor customer withdrawal requests.</li>
<li>It <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ftx-and-alameda-file-for-bankruptcy-sbf-resigns-as-ceo/" data-wpel-link="internal">filed</a> for bankruptcy protection, while its former CEO &#8211; SBF &#8211; was arrested and sent to the Fox Hill Prison in the Bahamas.</li>
<li>The authorities later deported him to the US, where he was <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sam-bankman-fried-released-on-a-250m-bail-can-stay-at-parents-house/" data-wpel-link="internal">released</a> on a record $250 million bond.

<li>He recently <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sam-bankman-fried-pleads-not-guilty-trial-date-set/" data-wpel-link="internal">pleaded</a> not guilty to the charges that he knowingly defrauded investors for billions of dollars. His trial date is set for October 2.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[SBF pleaded not guilty and had his trial date set for October this year. Gemini fired shots against Digital Currency Group. Bitcoin remains stable among all of it.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The total cryptocurrency market capitalization managed to increase by around $17 billion in the past seven days. Interestingly enough, the gains came mostly on the back of altcoins. This is highlighted in the declining Bitcoin dominance &#8211; a metric that&#8217;s commonly used to gauge BTC&#8217;s share relative to that of the rest of the market.</p>
<p>At the time of this writing, the BTC dominance sits at 38.1%, having peaked at over 38.4% last week.  Bitcoin&#8217;s price increased by a total of 0.9%, whereas altcoins such as BNB and ETH are up over 4%. Cardano surprised market participants and soared by around 11%, whereas Solana is undoubtedly the best performer from the leading coins, increasing by 37%.</p>
<p>While there are plenty of reasons for Solana&#8217;s increase, perhaps a leading one played the newly-created memecoin called Bonk Inu (BONK). It soared throughout the past seven days, driving massive volume and increasing overall activity on the Solana network. However, today, BONK has been charting devastating losses.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Sam Bankman-Fried appeared before a US court and pleaded not guilty to all criminal charges against him. This means that there will be a trial procedure, and the date for its beginning has been set to the start of October. In addition, SBF&#8217;s lawyers also filed a motion to retain control over some $450 million worth of Robinhood shares that the DOJ intended to seize.</p>
<p>Speaking of the DOJ, the New York Attorney General, Letitia James, filed a lawsuit against Celsius Network co-founder and former CEO &#8211; Alex Mashinsky. The top prosecutor alleged that Mashinsky defrauded investors of billions worth of digital assets.</p>
<p>The bad news didn&#8217;t stop there. Genesis &#8211; the DCG-owned cryptocurrency lender &#8211; is reported to be considering filing for bankruptcy, while DCG itself cut its wealth management arm.</p>
<p>On more positive news, Bitcoin turned 14 years old on January 3rd, but for that. It remains very interesting to see how the market will shape going forward, as well as the entire industry.</p>

<h2>About TRON DAO</h2>
<p>TRON DAO is a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps.</p>
<p>Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of January 2023, it has over 133 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4.5 billion total transactions, and over $9.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry &#8211; TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON&#8217;s official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government’s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (“DMC”), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica’s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens &#8211; TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US continued to beat expectations in terms of new jobs added for the month of December, according to the Labor Department.</p>
<p>The unemployment rate dropped to historic lows.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">report</a> for December 2022 indicated that the unemployment rate is down to 3.5% from 3.7% the previous month.</li>
<li>At the same time, the world&#8217;s most powerful economy added 223,000 jobs in December, which was higher than Bloomberg&#8217;s estimates of 200,000.</li>
<li>Overall, the US finished the year with 4.5 million new jobs filled, trailing only to 2021, when the country was recovering from the COVID-19-induced crash.</li>
<li>The best month in 2022 in terms of jobs added was February, with over 700,000, while December was last, even though it was better than expected.</li>
</ul>

<li>Shortly after the report went live, bitcoin started to move, heading north with a minor $150 move. As a result, the cryptocurrency jumped to just over $16,800 but retraced almost as quickly.</li>
<li>Certain US announcements, such as CPI numbers and interest rate hikes, have a more significant effect on BTC&#8217;s price movements. You can check all the dates for both in the upcoming year <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/here-are-the-dates-for-the-2023-cpi-releases-and-fomc-meetings/" data-wpel-link="internal">here</a>.</li>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, we take a closer look at Ethereum, Ripple, Cardano, Litecoin, and Solana</p>
<h2>Ethereum (ETH)</h2>
<p>This Wednesday, the bulls took over the price action and pushed ETH all the way to the key resistance at $1,260. Since then, the price seemed unable to break above. Nevertheless, Ethereum still managed to book a 3.8% increase in the past seven days.</p>
<p>The fact that in the past two days, the price has been rather timid in pulling back from this most recent rally suggests that sellers are exhausted or lack interest at this moment. This could turn into a key opportunity for the bulls.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, ETH is giving good signals that buyers are in control with higher lows and higher highs in the price action. Should they maintain the momentum, the next critical level to watch for is $1,365.</p>

<h2>Ripple (XRP)</h2>
<p>In complete contrast to Ethereum, XRP has been making lower lows after a significant decline on Monday, when the price briefly hit 30 cents. This led to a decrease of about 2.2% during the past seven days.</p>
<p>This week, the volume is in red, and sellers dominated the chart. This gives little hope of a reversal at this time, particularly when the key support at 33 cents is put again under pressure. Considering this price action, a break to the downside seems somewhat likely.</p>
<p>Since the spike on Monday could be indicative of things to come, it&#8217;s quite likely that XRP will have to revisit the 30 cents support before it can hope to reverse the current downtrend. Buyers don&#8217;t appear confident to stop this selling pressure.</p>

<h2>Cardano (ADA)</h2>
<p>Cardano surprised the market this week with a strong performance that saw the price increase by 11.4%. This momentum could continue, but the key resistance at 30 cents will be an important obstacle to overcome.</p>
<p>After finding good support at 24 cents, ADA managed to quickly recover some of the recent losses and continued to move higher every day. The volume and indicators support a continuation of this price action, but it&#8217;s important to see how buyers will manage the abovementioned resistance level.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, a test of $0.30 seems probable.</p>

<h2>Litecoin (LTC)</h2>
<p>LTC is one of the oldest altcoins on the market, having been launched in 2011. While it may not be flashy or new, its price action of late has been quite impressive. Litecoin managed to consistently move higher since June 2022. This is something few altcoins have achieved during this bear market.</p>
<p>Somehow, Litecoin has closed the past week with a price increase of almost 10% after breaking above $70 once again. Bulls appear keen to push this cryptocurrency higher, and they could even challenge the key resistance at $80.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, LTC is one of the few cryptocurrencies that are well-positioned to make higher highs. Right now, its biggest challenge is to break above $80. Perhaps this second attempt may be successful, which could put the cryptocurrency on the path toward $100.</p>
<figure id="attachment_231918" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-231918" style="width: 2852px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LTCUSDT_2023-01-06_16-52-56.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-231918" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LTCUSDT_2023-01-06_16-52-56.png" alt="LTCUSDT_2023-01-06_16-52-56" width="2852" height="1420" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LTCUSDT_2023-01-06_16-52-56.png 2852w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LTCUSDT_2023-01-06_16-52-56-300x149.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LTCUSDT_2023-01-06_16-52-56-1024x510.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LTCUSDT_2023-01-06_16-52-56-768x382.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LTCUSDT_2023-01-06_16-52-56-1536x765.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LTCUSDT_2023-01-06_16-52-56-2048x1020.png 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LTCUSDT_2023-01-06_16-52-56-50x25.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2852px) 100vw, 2852px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-231918" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Solana (SOL)</h2>
<p>Solana&#8217;s price action in the past 30 days can only be described as a crypto roller coaster. After falling under $10, it quickly rebounded and entered a significant rally on Monday when the price spiked higher, closing the past seven days with a 37% increase. This makes it the best-performing altcoin on our list this week.</p>
<p>After finding great support at $9.5, Solana entered a sustained rally that did not stop until $14. The key resistance is found at $15, and it would be even more surprising to see it break this level considering its performance this week.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, a test of the key resistance appears likely. But for this to happen, the overall market needs to turn bullish or at least stay neutral. Otherwise, Solana could be dragged down back to $10.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[HT declined to a monthly low of $4.38 as concerns mounted over Huobi's health. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a bid to weather the unprecedented turmoil in the market, Huobi is the latest company to introduce job cuts. The crypto exchange is planning to lay off about 20% of its staff, a move that was confirmed by Tron founder and a member of Huobi&#8217;s global advisory board &#8211; Justin Sun.</p>
<p>In a text message to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/crypto-exchange-huobi-lay-off-20-staff-justin-sun-2023-01-06/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Reuters</a>, Sun said the &#8220;structural adjustment&#8221; has not started and is expected to reach a conclusion by the end of the first quarter this year.</p>
<h2>&#8220;Ignore the FUD&#8221;</h2>
<p>The confirmation comes hours after Sun alleviated the investors&#8217; concerns and asked the community to ignore the FUD reiterating Binance CEO CZ&#8217;s words.</p>
<p>The FTX-induced contagion has dragged down several companies over the past several weeks. More recently, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/huobi-reportedly-plans-mass-layoffs-and-salary-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">speculation</a> about Huobi&#8217;s job cuts and strife in internal communications rang alarm bells triggering significant withdrawals by investors. According to <a href="https://defillama.com/cexs" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">data</a> compiled by DeFiLlama, Huobi recorded an outflow of more than $85 million over the past 24 hours alone, taking its weekly outflows to nearly $136 million.</p>
<p>While addressing rumors of potential insolvency, Sun said,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In conclusion, at Huobi, our strategy is to &#8220;Ignore FUD and Keep Building.&#8221; By staying true to our mission, investing in technology and security, and listening to our users, we&#8217;re able to provide a trusted and reliable platform for our users to buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrency.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Sun earlier brushed off rumors of mass lay-offs at Huobi after Chinese reporter Colin Wu <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1610615698254102529" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">claimed</a> that the exchange was looking to scrap all year-end bonuses amid an ongoing industry slump.</p>
<h2>Huobi&#8217;s Proof-of-Reserves</h2>
<p>Huobi&#8217;s recently released proof-of-reserves revealed that the crypto exchange relied most on its own token to denominate its reserves. Caue Oliveria, one of CryptoQuant’s author-analysts, <a href="https://twitter.com/caueconomy/status/1603362176164560898" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">revealed</a> that around 44.36% of its capital is allocated in HT and described its reserves as having a &#8220;highly risky setup at the moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>The low allocation of stablecoins was yet another red flag that, according to Oliveria, is unfavorable for the crypto exchange.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;According to data collected by CryptoQuant, around 44.36% of its capital is allocated in HT, self token issued by the platform. Would this exchange be the next to crash? This type of risk can put pressure on the platform&#8217;s sustainability if they have high withdrawals as they did on FTX.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
