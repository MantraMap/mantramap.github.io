					<description><![CDATA[In the legal battle between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the recent order granting in part and denying in part the motion for Summary Judgment by Judge Torres has left many XRP investors eagerly awaiting the next steps. To shed some light on the situation, prominent attorney Jeremy Hogan has shared his thoughts on the matter, offering valuable insights into the potential appeal process with deadlines and its implications for both parties involved. Ripple Vs. SEC: The Next Possible Deadline Hogan, a seasoned attorney with experience in appeals, cautions that appeals are typically pursued after a case is completely finished. “After the final judgment is entered, either party has 60 days to appeal,” says Hogan who emphasized that the Ripple case is not yet finalized, any potential appeal at this stage would be considered an &#8220;interlocutory appeal.&#8221; Related Reading: XRP Explodes With 1,300% Surge In Trading Volume As crypto Exchanges Jump On Board “As far as I can see in the Rules, you have 10 days to notice an interlocutory appeal”, states Hogan. Since the Summary Judgment was issued on July 13, an appeal by the SEC or Ripple Labs would have to be filed by July 23 at the latest (or by July 24 if the deadline does not start until the following day). This means that next Monday at the latest it will become public whether one of the parties files an appeal. But an interlocutory appeal is rarely granted and generally requires compelling reasons, such as the release of significant information that could impact the case. However, Hogan points out that Judge Torres did not certify her ruling for immediate review, indicating that an interlocutory appeal might not be granted in this scenario. This suggests that the SEC and Ripple would need to wait for a final judgment before pursuing an appeal. Hogan believes that both parties might ultimately choose not to appeal for various reasons. According to the lawyer, the SEC might hesitate to appeal because, even if successful, it could potentially jeopardize their overall case. Winning the appeal would retract some unfavorable aspects of the trial-level case. However, if the SEC were to lose at the appellate level, it could set a precedent that all courts in the 2nd DCA (Second District Court of Appeals) would have to follow, amplifying the impact of their loss. Related Reading: Large Exchanges Relist XRP Following Ripple Victory Over SEC On the other hand, Hogan believes that Ripple may opt not to appeal if it can afford to pay the fine and if the ruling&#8217;s effect on its business, particularly the aspect concerning the On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) feature, is manageable. These factors, combined with the fact that Ripple secured a favorable outcome in the ruling, might dissuade them from pursuing an appeal. When considering the potential difficulties in winning an appeal, Hogan emphasizes that Judge Torres is the one who has meticulously reviewed the entire case record. This makes the appellate process inherently challenging for either party, further reducing the likelihood of an appeal. Regarding the SEC&#8217;s challenge in appealing the secondary market sales aspect, which presents a problematic area for the regulatory body, Hogan admits that he hasn&#8217;t solidified his thoughts on the matter yet. XRP Price The XRP price has taken a breather after the stunning rally following the Ripple summary judgment. After being rejected at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.93, the XRP price is currently trading at $0.7481. After a possible retest of the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.68, the impulsive move may see a continuation. The final verdict in the Ripple v. SEC case and possible appeals will certainly continue to have a strong impact on the price. Featured image from Outlook India, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The value and popularity of TerraUSD Classic, or USTC, the algorithmic stablecoin of the Terra Classic (LUNC) ecosystem, have skyrocketed recently. Today, the stablecoin makes a surprise rally, sparking a great deal of interest among investors and cryptocurrency aficionados. The sharp growth in USTC could be an indication of a sharp rise in demand and emphasizes the market&#8217;s rising confidence in this stablecoin. Data from crypto market tracker Coingecko shows USTC trading at $0.0186, notching a 24-hour increase in value of 21.4%. In the last seven days, the stablecoin registered an impressive 58% rally, causing its trading volume to balloon to a solid 409%. Source: Coingecko USTC Organic Growth Pushes Stablecoin Up Despite the fact that the causes of this upswing are yet unknown, the recent spike in USTC&#8217;s value shows organic growth. &#8220;Organic growth&#8221; refers to the increase in value of USTC that occurs naturally, without the influence of external factors or artificial means. Related Reading: Dogecoin Engagement Fails To Impress, Raising Concerns About Broader Interest It suggests that the growth is the result of the company&#8217;s internal operations, strategies, and market dynamics, rather than being driven by external factors such as acquisitions, mergers, or financial manipulations. After it was de-pegged more than a year ago, USTC saw a huge price decline. Since USTC is a stablecoin with a 1:1 tie to the USD, its price should always be $1. The stablecoin has since traded at lower prices, reaching a 52-week high of $0.06 during that time. There are signs, nevertheless, that USTC could revisit the $1 level and recoup its worth. Total market cap of cryptocurrencies as of today stood at $1.17 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com The TerraUSD Classic de-pegging caused major difficulties for the larger digital currency ecosystem, and its effects are still being felt today. A few Web3.0 firms with exposure to its parent company Terraform Labs went out of business in addition to the more than 99% decline in price of its linked cryptocurrency, Terra Classic. Related Reading: BNB Chain Inks New Record With Soaring User Activity – A Boost For Price? The implosion of FTX Derivatives Exchange was finally driven by the bankruptcies of Celsius Network and Voyager Digital, which prolonged the crypto winter even further. Meanwhile, in order to expand supply and rekindle interest in the stablecoin, the Terra Classic community is launching projects like staking and burning LUNC tokens while also working to improve infrastructure. Source: Coingecko Will The Terra Classic Stablecoin Retest $1? There is growing consensus that the TerraUSD Classic token is steadily approaching a retesting of the significant $1 price level. Among investors and enthusiasts alike, this strong rising trend has spurred new optimism. As the TerraUSD Classic token gains momentum, it boosts community members&#8217; faith in its capability to uphold its pegged value and function as a dependable digital asset. The community may become excited and eager in anticipation of a probable retest of the $1 price level, which would improve the outlook for TerraUSD Classic&#8217;s long-term prospects.

					<description><![CDATA[SNX, the native token of the Synthetix Network, has been on the rise, gaining more than 35% in the past week. The cryptocurrency continues to exhibit strong bullish momentum, having registered a positive market performance over the past few weeks. SNX’s recent price surge has been linked to the positive sentiment surrounding the Synthetix network. A few days ago, the protocol announced its plan to release a new decentralized exchange (DEX). Related Reading: Dogecoin Engagement Fails To Impress, Raising Concerns About Broader Interest Synthetix Token Tallies 35% In One Week &#8211; Price Overview The cryptocurrency market experienced a jolt of positivity after the long-running battle between payments and technology firm Ripple &#8211; the company behind XRP &#8211; and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) came to a positive conclusion on Thursday. US District Judge Annalisa Torres delivered a landmark judgment declaring the XRP token as non-security, thereby granting a decisive triumph for Ripple. However, unlike other cryptocurrencies, the price of SNX barely reacted to this piece of news. The token’s value increased by a mere 5% following the announcement of the court’s decision. SNX did experience a surge of its own the following day. On Friday, July 14, the token’s price jumped by nearly 40%, touching the $3 level before retracing back to $2.5. As of this writing, the Synthetix token is valued at $2.82, with an 8% price increase in the last 24 hours. With a market cap of $903.4 million, SNX ranks as the 47th-biggest cryptocurrency, according to CoinGecko data. SNXUSD trading at $2.738 &#124; Source: SNXUSD chart from TradingView The recent increase in SNX&#8217;s price is believed to have been triggered by the announcement of a new Synthetix trading product. In a blogpost released on Friday, the protocol&#8217;s founder Kain Warwick unveiled plans to introduce a new derivatives front-end called Infinex. What Is Infinex? Infinex is a new derivatives front-end to the decentralized trading infrastructure of Synthetix. The exchange is expected to be an improvement on the already-existing Kwenta, Synthetix’s derivatives decentralized exchange on Optimism. According to Kain Warwick, Infinex will remove the impediments to the growth of Synthetix&#8217;s decentralized trading ecosystem. Firstly, it will address the inconvenience of acquiring sUSD, Synthetix’s stablecoin, to begin trading on Kwenta. Also, it will eliminate the need to sign every action on the current platform. Warwick claims that the purpose of Infinex is to provide competition for centralized exchanges (CEXs) while eliminating any uncertainty surrounding decentralized perpetuals (Perps). The blogpost also revealed that Infinex will cater to users familiar with CEX platforms, providing its trading services through a username and password. With this, users would be able to generate a public-private key pair, which will be locally stored in the browser. It is worth noting that this key pair is not designed for fund withdrawals. Instead, it would be used to sign trades on the upcoming decentralized exchange. While the blogpost didn&#8217;t reveal the exact launch date of Infinex, it disclosed that the project’s introduction should come alongside the release of Synthetix’s Perps V3.  Related Reading: Stablecoin TrueUSD To Be Fully Controlled By Asian Owner Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from TradingView]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Featured Image From Kraken, Chart From Tradingview. In today&#8217;s news, the prominent stablecoin TrueUSD &#8211; with the ticker TUSD &#8211; is now undergoing a management change.  According to a thread this morning by the project’s official Twitter handle, Archblock Inc., the current TUSD operator, has begun the transfer of total control of Token to its Asian-based owners, Techteryx Ltd.  Techteryx Finally Assumes Control Of TrueUSD Back in December 2020, Techteryx acquired ownership of TUSD but hired Archblock to keep maintaining the stablecoin’s operations. And for the last two years in which Archblock remained TUSD’s operator, Techteryx claims to have been focusing on expanding the token’s foreign use cases in the global markets.  Related Reading: BUSD Market Cap Plunge Of 80% Raises Concerns Of Impending Collapse However, Archblock has now commenced the transfer of control yesterday, July 13, marking the end phase of TUSD’s international transition. Upon completion, Techteryx will reportedly assume full management of all aspects of the stablecoin’s operation. These controls will include mining and redemptions, customer onboarding and compliance, conservation of fiat reserve, and maintenance of banking and fiduciary relationships. During the transition period, Archblock will continue to support the US-based TUSD users, with Techteryx stepping in with the necessary guidance and further updates.  Prior to today&#8217;s news, TUSD has attracted some interest especially following Binance&#8217;s recent moves with the stablecoin. On June 21, the cryptocurrency exchange announced the launch of a TUSD zero-maker fee promotion for spot and margin trading pairs beginning from June 30. Interestingly, Binance had minted $1 billion worth of TUSD on the Tron network a week before making that announcement becoming the largest holder of the token. Related Reading: Stablecoin Market Share Dwindles As USDC And BUSD Supply Deplete At the time of writing, Ethercscan data shows that Binance accounts for over 68% of TUSD&#8217;s circulating supply, estimated at $1.92 billion. With a market cap value of $2.8 billion, TrueUSD currently ranks as the 5th largest stablecoin and 27th largest cryptocurrency, according to data by Coingecko.  TUSD Valued At $0.99 On The 4-Hour Chart &#124; Source: TUSDUSD Chart On Tradingview.com The Stablecoin Market In 2023 Stablecoins are considered a vital part of the crypto space, especially due to their constant value, allowing traders and investors to avoid the volatility of the crypto market.  According to data from DeFi ilLama, the stablecoin market has been on the decline all year, with its total market cap shrinking from $137.79 billion on January 1 to its current value of $126.96 billion, accounting for 9.86% of the total crypto market.  Related Reading: Stablecoin Sharks &#38; Whales Show Strong Accumulation, Good Sign For Bitcoin?

<p>In today&#8217;s news, the prominent stablecoin TrueUSD &#8211; with the ticker TUSD &#8211; is now undergoing a management change.  According to a <a href="https://twitter.com/tusdio/status/1679712914050289665?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">thread this morning</a> by the project’s official Twitter handle, Archblock Inc., the current TUSD operator, has begun the transfer of total control of Token to its Asian-based owners, Techteryx Ltd. </p>
<h2>Techteryx Finally Assumes Control Of TrueUSD</h2>
<p>Back in December 2020, Techteryx <a href="https://trueusd.medium.com/scaling-trust-announcing-tusds-next-stage-of-growth-f1fb58d62b" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">acquired</a> ownership of TUSD but hired Archblock to keep maintaining the stablecoin’s operations. And for the last two years in which Archblock remained TUSD’s operator, Techteryx claims to have been focusing on expanding the token’s foreign use cases in the global markets. </p>

<p>However, Archblock has now commenced the transfer of control yesterday, July 13, marking the end phase of TUSD’s international transition. Upon completion, Techteryx will reportedly assume full management of all aspects of the stablecoin’s operation.</p>
<p>These controls will include mining and redemptions, customer onboarding and compliance, conservation of fiat reserve, and maintenance of banking and fiduciary relationships.</p>
<p>During the transition period, Archblock will continue to support the US-based TUSD users, with Techteryx stepping in with the necessary guidance and further updates. </p>
<p>Prior to today&#8217;s news, TUSD has attracted some interest especially following Binance&#8217;s recent moves with the stablecoin. On June 21, the cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-launches-tusd-zero-maker-fee-promotion-and-updates-fee-promotions-for-busd-usd-stablecoin-pairs-a376bf14673044e0a1fae8fe60cb0700" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> the launch of a TUSD zero-maker fee promotion for spot and margin trading pairs beginning from June 30.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Binance <a href="https://twitter.com/whale_alert/status/1669306467520851969?s=46&amp;t=JAUmthpFclo8jS4VJkm3DQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">had minted</a> $1 billion worth of TUSD on the Tron network a week before making that announcement becoming the largest holder of the token.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x0000000000085d4780B73119b644AE5ecd22b376#balances" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ethercscan data</a> shows that Binance accounts for over 68% of TUSD&#8217;s circulating supply, estimated at $1.92 billion. With a market cap value of $2.8 billion, TrueUSD currently ranks as the 5th largest stablecoin and 27th largest cryptocurrency, according to data by Coingecko. </p>

<h2>The Stablecoin Market In 2023</h2>
<p>Stablecoins are considered a vital part of the crypto space, especially due to their constant value, allowing traders and investors to avoid the volatility of the crypto market. </p>
<p>According to <a href="https://defillama.com/stablecoins" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">data from DeFi ilLama</a>, the stablecoin market has been on the decline all year, with its total market cap shrinking from $137.79 billion on January 1 to its current value of $126.96 billion, accounting for 9.86% of the total crypto market. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[The news of Ripple&#8217;s recent partial victory against the SEC after a legal battle spanning almost three years sent a ripple of joy around the entire crypto industry. However, according to a legal expert on Twitter, Lawyer Bryan Jacoutot, the victory might be short-lived as SEC has enough grounds to appeal the decision and drag this thing out for a lot longer. The SEC&#8217;s Lawsuit Against Ripple Labs The SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs in December 2020, alleging that Ripple had conducted an unregistered securities offering worth over $1.3 billion through the sale of XRP. According to the SEC, XRP is a security under federal securities laws. But the court determined on June 13 that the random &#8220;programmatic sale&#8221; of XRP to regular investors does not constitute the sale of an unregistered security under Howey.  Related Reading: Large Exchanges Relist XRP Following Ripple Victory Over SEC However, sales to institutional investors fall under Howey, which is used in the United States to determine whether a transaction qualifies as an investment contract. In this case, the Court found that the buyers couldn&#8217;t know who was selling them the XRP, unlike the institutional investors who would expect Ripple Labs to use the capital for the betterment of the Ripple ecosystem. According to Jacoutot, the Court&#8217;s reasoning is weak and Howey was misapplied in the case. The Court reasoned that regular investors bought XRP fully knowing that it is subject to the general cryptocurrency market trends, especially secondary sales of XRP tokens. However, Jacoutot believes those buying XRP would have also expected to make a profit from the efforts of Ripple Labs. XRP price at $0.7254 &#124; Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com The attorney also made a case of the Ethereum Foundation, as everyone who took part in the pre-sale of ETH knew they were buying from Ethereum Foundation. When looking at the XRP ruling in a similar manner, this would mean institutional investors of the ETH presale also bought unregistered securities. What Does The Ruling Mean? According to Jacoutot, the ruling opens up a few loopholes that can be exploited. In a tweet by attorney Joe Carlasare on Twitter, it explains that the logic of the ruling leaves an opening that can be used to lawfully launch a pyramid scheme. In this case, profits from the &#8220;programmatic sales&#8221; to retail investors can be distributed to institutional investors. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has said the ruling provided relief and that the company could now promote the various use cases for Ripple and its technology without worrying about legal repercussions.

					<description><![CDATA[Is Dogecoin (DOGE losing its charm? Despite the impressive price rally in May, recent trends suggest a decline in engagement and investor interest. As the crypto market continues to evolve, concerns are mounting about the broader implications of Dogecoin&#8217;s waning appeal.  Dogecoin&#8217;s engagement metrics have faltered, leaving some experts wondering if the crypto&#8217;s allure is wearing off. Market indicators show a decline in trading volume, with fewer transactions taking place compared to previous months.  Will this once-beloved digital currency be able to regain its momentum, or is its star beginning to fade? Dogecoin New Addresses Stagnant The growth of new addresses joining the Dogecoin community has hit a roadblock since May, according to a recent DOGE price report. However, on-chain data analysis reveals that this stagnation in new holders has not adversely affected the weighted sentiment associated with the cryptocurrency.

This metric provides insights into the average sentiment attached to a particular cryptocurrency, taking into account the unique social volume surrounding it. Interestingly, despite the somewhat negative value, the weighted sentiment has shown improvement from its low point of -1.99 on June 9. This shift suggests that the prevailing defeatist perception during that period has gradually shifted towards a more optimistic outlook. DOGE market cap slightly above the $10 billion level. Chart: TradingView.com Social Volume And Holder Count: A Diverging Trend However, while the weighted sentiment demonstrates a positive trajectory, the coin&#8217;s social volume tells a different story. Instead of aligning with the stagnant number of holders, the social volume of Dogecoin has remained remarkably low since June 9, as per Santiment&#8217;s data. Social volume measures the number of mentions and discussions specifically related to a cryptocurrency across various platforms. In the case of Dogecoin, this metric indicates a significant decrease in overall online activity and conversations surrounding the coin. Related Reading: Cardano Development Activity Dropping – What Does It Mean For ADA Price? As of now, there have been no significant changes in the aforementioned trends. This suggests that the hype surrounding DOGE has diminished considerably. From a market perspective, this could potentially indicate that the coin is undervalued and has yet to reach its peak valuation. The road ahead for Dogecoin appears challenging, as the cryptocurrency grapples with stagnant new addresses and a decline in social volume. However, it would be premature to discount the resilience of this meme-based digital asset. Source: Coingecko As of the latest data from Coingecko, the price of DOGE stands at $0.068, reflecting a decline of 4.7% over the past 24 hours.
