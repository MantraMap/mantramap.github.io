<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>One of the biggest publicly listed cryptocurrency mining businesses in the US, Core Scientific, has announced that it is declaring bankruptcy.</em></li>



<li><em>The firm continues to have a good cash flow and intends to mine while paying off its debts.</em></li>



<li><em>The move is a spread of Celsius, one of Core&#8217;s clients.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>According to a familiar person with the company&#8217;s finances, Core Scientific, one of the biggest publicly traded crypto mining businesses in the U.S., is filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Texas early on Wednesday morning. <em>CNBC</em> first <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/20/bitcoin-miner-core-scientific-filing-for-bankruptcy-will-keep-mining.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> about this case.</strong></h5>

<p>According to a personal acquaintance with the company&#8217;s financial condition, who asked to remain unnamed to discuss private company affairs, the company is still producing positive cash flow, but that money is insufficient to pay off the financial obligation associated with the equipment it was leasing. </p>



<p>This source states the company will not go into liquidation but will carry on as usual while negotiating a solution with senior security noteholders, who are responsible for the majority of the company&#8217;s debt.</p>



<p>As of the close of trade on Tuesday, Core Scientific&#8217;s market capitalization was at $78 million, down from a $4.3 billion valuation in July 2021 when the firm went public via a special purpose acquisition vehicle or SPAC. Over the past year, the stock has decreased by more than 98%.</p>



<p>Holders of Core&#8217;s common shares may not lose all of their investment, despite what Core had said in a filing in October if the industry as a whole rebounds. Additionally, the business payments that it would not make the debt payments that were due in late October and early November and that it stated that it was free to take the business to court for nonpayment. The action comes after a year of rising energy prices and falling Bitcoin prices.</p>



<p>The price of Bitcoin has fallen from an all-time high of around $69,000 in November 2021 to roughly $16,800. Core Scientific mostly mines Bitcoin. Its profit margins have been reduced as a result of that value decline, increasing rivalry among miners, and rising energy prices. At the time of writing, <a href="https://coincu.com/currencies/btc-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BTC</a> is trading at <strong>$16,633</strong>.</p>

<p>Celsius, a cryptocurrency lender, sought bankruptcy protection in July and was a Core Scientific client. Another illustration of the contagion effect affecting the whole crypto industry this year is when Celsius&#8217; debts were financial during its bankruptcy procedures, which put pressure on Core&#8217;s sheet.</p>



<p>Not only Core Scientific but miners in the crypto industry are also having problems.</p>



<p>Compute North, a company that offers infrastructure and hosting services for cryptocurrency mining, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in September, while another miner, Marathon Digital Holdings, disclosed an exposure to Compute North of $80 million. Argo Blockchain is also currently struggling during the harsh crypto winter period.</p>

<p>According to the statement, <strong>higher-quality cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH</strong> are projected to be driven by elements including sustainable tokenomics, ecosystem maturity, and relative market liquidity, which may lead to the creation of <strong>key value opportunities</strong>.</p>



<p>In terms of Silver linings, the firm said that many traditional risk assets still seem rich, and <strong>the investment theses for cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH have not fundamentally changed in their view</strong>. However, in the first quarter of 2023, digital currencies will need a differentiated catalyst in order to be decoupled from conventional risk assets.</p>

Such permissioned networks would be able to address issues like undercollateralized credit with price permissioned liquidity pools that comply with anti-money laundering regulations</p>

<p>When it comes to crypto lending practices, Coinbase wrote that borrowing in the cryptocurrency realm has grown to be quite difficult in 2022 due to all of the credit that has been removed from the system. However, the fact that <strong>lender impairment from the collapse of Celsius and 3AC is still there suggests that consolidation is still taking place rather than that there is renewed pressure on these entities as a result of the failure of FTX.</strong></p>



<p>Instead of coming from a retail basis, institutional investors will now be the source of future loan inventories. Even if it could take some time for institutional credit activity to return to previous levels.</p>

<p class="has-small-font-size">Borrowing will likely not be a challenge for credit-worthy, responsible borrowers.</p>

<p>As for bitcoin miners, <strong>precarious economic conditions show no improvement</strong>, with mining companies selling nearly 135% of coins mined per day, and this means that miners are liquidating the entirety of their newly mined coins as well as portions of their BTC reserves, according to the report.</p>

<p class="has-small-font-size">Challenging conditions (such as higher input costs and lower output value), combined with elevated energy prices, have resulted in a highly stressed economic environment for bitcoin miners for the past several quarters.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However, <strong>market conditions may drive businesses to shut down or &#8220;be acquired by more well-capitalized players&#8221;</strong> if other mining companies don&#8217;t buck the trend. For that reason, the firm expects the bitcoin mining industry to consolidate even further in 2023.</p>

<p class="has-small-font-size">It&#8217;s best to create regulatory clarity first around centralized actors in crypto (stablecoin issuers, exchanges, and custodians) because this is where we&#8217;ve seen the most risk of consumer harm, and pretty much everyone can agree it should be done.</p>

<p>Following the fall of FTX, a crypto exchange that filed for bankruptcy protection in November after allegedly abusing billions of dollars in client assets, lawmakers are focused on regulating the crypto business. Prosecutors in the United States charged co-founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried with fraud and money laundering last week.</p>

<p>According to Armstrong, <strong>stablecoins should be regulated first, then centralized exchanges and custodians</strong>, making room for DeFi to develop.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">Regulating stablecoin issuers is a good place to start, because there is broad interest in D.C., and we can get some momentum with a quick win, we don&#8217;t need to do anything fancy or crypto-specific here; stablecoins can be regulated under standard financial services laws by using, for instance, a state trust charter or an OCC national trust charter.</p>
<cite>Armstrong said</cite></blockquote>



<p><strong>Armstrong predicts a stablecoin law could be passed in the first half of next year by adopting regulatory frameworks </strong>from traditional financial services, freeing up regulators to concentrate on the more difficult tasks of developing a regulatory framework for centralized crypto players and determining which digital assets qualify as securities or commodities.</p>

<p>Bank transfers are being made available to customers in most<strong> U.S. states, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and the Single European Payments Arena, commonly known as SEPA.</strong></p>



<p>The firm said on December 20 that its <strong>users would now be able to convert money to cryptocurrency</strong> in minutes on the Ethereum mainnet, Polygon, Optimism, and Artibrum.</p>

<p>Decentralized exchanges (DEX) include built-in user security, self-custodial wallets, permissionless, immutable protocols, and transparent public ledgers, according to Uniswap, making them a considerably safer alternative to centralized exchanges (CEX).</p>



<p><strong>Depending on the user&#8217;s location</strong>, Uniswap will initially offer Dai, Ether, USD Coin, Tether, Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC), and Wrapped Ether (wETH).</p>

<p>The firm acknowledged that despite the dangers involved, <strong>customers still prefer CEXs and that the onboarding process for decentralized finance (DeFi) has been a significant barrier to adoption</strong>. With no spread costs on USDC, the lowest processing fees in the industry, and immediate access, Uniswap anticipates that its most recent deployment will enhance the onboarding experience.</p>



<p>On December 13, Coincus <a href="https://news.coincu.com/151420-uniswap-declines-in-fees-per-core-developer/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/151420-uniswap-declines-in-fees-per-core-developer/" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported </a>that Uniswap decreased the developer&#8217;s fee, which was affected by the devaluation of UNI. Additionally, <strong>the firm regulatory council will decide whether to test a “fee switch” on a selection of pools</strong> in the near future.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried-signs-extradition-papers/story?id=95621512" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ABC News</a>, the former <strong>CEO of FTX SBF has signed an extradition document in the Bahamas and will be handed over to New York </strong>to face prosecution following the collapse of a company once valued at $ 32 billion. He will appear in court again on Wednesday.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>The move was expected, as Bankman-Fried is said to have agreed in principle on December 19 to be extradited to the US, despite earlier reports suggesting that <strong>he wanted to see the indictment against him first.</strong></p>



<p>After the final paperwork is signed, Bankman-Fried is expected to be taken to a private airport by FBI agents and transited to the US on a private flight, where he faces eight charges in the indictment of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York.</p>

<p>As updated in an earlier Coincu News article on December 20, Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s legal team is currently in <strong><a href="https://news.coincu.com/152955-sbf-gives-up-opposing-extradition-to-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discussions</a></strong> with federal prosecutors to allow him to be released on bail when extradited to the US.</p>



<p>The agreement would require approval from the federal judge overseeing the SBF&#8217;s case and could include &#8220;<strong>highly restrictive conditions</strong>&#8221; such as home confinement and electronic surveillance, according to people with knowledge of the matter.</p>



<p>The charges carry a<strong> maximum sentence of 115 years in prison if convicted on all counts</strong>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="315" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1542.png" alt="SBF

<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-20/bankrupt-crypto-lender-celsius-receives-multiple-bids-for-retail-mining-assets#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a>, a report filed in court by bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network LLC on Tuesday shows that <strong>the company has received multiple offers to acquire its retail platform and mining business. </strong></p>

<p>Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. Celsius&#8217; attorneys told US Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn at Tuesday&#8217;s hearing to include proposals for a retail platform, mining operations and a combination of the two. <strong>Potential buyers include 30 parties</strong>.</p>



<p>Celsius advisers have yet to decide whether to sell the entire crypto lending company, or split it up for sale, or pursue another restructuring plan.</p>

<p>The company&#8217;s attorney, Chris Koenig, told the hearing that they plan to work with potential buyers in the coming weeks to improve existing offers and <strong>announce in mid-January 2023 whether they sell or not.</strong></p>



<p>The company&#8217;s interim CEO, Chris Ferraro, told the hearing that Celsius mining has generated positive operating cash flow each month this year. He said the company will continue to expand its mining operations.</p>



<p>As was updated in an earlier Coincu News article, US Bankruptcy Court Judge Martin Glenn <strong>issued an order that crypto lending platform Celsius Network must <a href="https://news.coincu.com/150018-celsius-return-44m-crypto-assets-to-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">return approximately $44 million</a> worth of cryptocurrency for users.</strong></p>

<p>As a result, the bankrupt cryptocurrency company <strong><a href="https://news.coincu.com/150314-celsius-solve-customer-issues-the-hearing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discussed</a></strong> <strong>reopening withdrawals for some customers</strong>. They are approaching customer recovery in phases. Even so, the amount of money that customers are returned is only a very small part of the damage they suffer from this bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Metamask supports <strong>any network that is compatible with the Ethereum network,</strong> such as the <strong>Binance Smart Chain, Cronos,</strong> and <strong>Avalanche</strong> networks. Users will need to manually add these networks to their wallets based on the documentation given by each network.</p>



<p>The default network for all wallets is the <strong>Ethereum</strong> mainnet. However, users are also able to connect <strong>Metamask</strong> to other blockchain networks, such as <strong>Polygon, Fantom, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Cronos, Harmony ONE, Velas, HECO, xDAI.</strong></p>



<p>Last month, <strong>ConsenSys</strong> updated its privacy policy, stating that it collects IP addresses and wallet addresses of the wallet users when they use the infrastructure service Infura, which is also owned by <strong>ConsenSys</strong>. <strong>Infura</strong> is the default way for <strong>MetaMask</strong> users to connect to the <strong>Ethereum</strong> blockchain. The company updated its privacy policy following the <strong>Uniswap DEX</strong>.</p>

<p>Coincu previously <a href="https://news.coincu.com/149533-consensys-wont-collect-user-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that ConsenSys was met with a lot of criticism from the community after updating the privacy policy. The company has voiced its commitment to protecting the privacy of its users in its latest announcement with more specific updates. </p>



<p>Accordingly, <strong>ConsenSys</strong> says it does not store wallet account address information when the waller users make a <strong>&#8220;read&#8221; </strong>request through Infura, such as to check their account balance in <strong>MetaMask</strong>. So there is never a problem with linking a wallet account address with an <strong>internet protocol (IP)</strong> address.</p>

<p>Users may borrow stablecoin (MAI) at <strong>0% interest</strong> through <strong>Mai</strong> <strong>Finance</strong>, a zero-interest lending system. Anyone may establish <strong>QiDao</strong> vaults and put down assets to be used as security for loans.</p>



<p>With the overcollateralized stablecoin system known as Mai, loans are always secured by having more value locked than the debt.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">On Oct 18th 2022, the blockchain security team at Amber Group discovered a critical reentrancy vulnerability in two Mai Finance’s vaults (SCSEMVT and YCSEMVT), and reported it to Mai Finance.<br><br>We elaborate on the details of our findings<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f447.png" alt="👇" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><a href="https://t.co/yssroFYujx" target="_blank">https://t.co/yssroFYujx</a></p>&mdash; Amber Group (@ambergroup_io) <a href="https://twitter.com/ambergroup_io/status/1605178657919893505?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December 20, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p><strong>ChainSecurity</strong> revealed a new type of reentrancy flaw in <strong>Curve</strong> in the middle of <strong>October 2022</strong>. The so-called read-only reentrancy vulnerability enables an attacker to revisit the <strong>get virtual price()</strong> oracle function through a carefully written smart contract and obtain an inflated LP token price in return, opening the door for criminals to benefit. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1526.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="941" height="420" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1526.png" alt="Amber Group: Vulnerability In Mai Finance&#039;s Vault Has Been Fixed" class="wp-image-153960" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1526.png 941w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1526-300x134.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1526-768x343.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1526-750x335.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 941px) 100vw, 941px" title="Amber Group: Vulnerability In Mai Finance&#039;s Vault Has Been Fixed 38"></a></figure></div>


<p>To get the price of an LP token produced from the pegged assets of a stable swap pool, a lending protocol linked with Curve LPs often employs the oracle function offered by <strong>Curve</strong> and named <strong>get virtual price()</strong>.</p>



<p>For the time being, the attacker is free to alter the execution flow any way they choose. What happens if the attacker calls <strong>get virtual price()</strong> once more in the fallback function&#8217;s initial line? The virtual price increases when the quantity of Curve LP tokens is reduced, and the balances are not updated. Then, another batch of underlying assets might be removed, or even some pools could be drained using the manipulated pricing.</p>



<p>The QiDao&#8217;s <strong>YCSEMVT</strong> vault modified <strong>get virtual price() </strong>as one of the sources to estimate the collateral price as a result of becoming one of the targets of the new read-only reentrancy attack.</p>

<p>Ethereum founder <a href="https://news.coincu.com/149564-vitalik-buterin-dissatisfied-coindesks-rank/"><strong>Vitalik Buterin</strong></a> revealed his prognosis for <strong>the crypto sector in 2023</strong> in an interview with Bankless&#8217; David Hoffman, addressing Hoffman&#8217;s rising concerns that the adoption wave of Decentralized applications is now finished and there are less chances for developers in the future.</p>



<p>As a result, Vitalik Buterin outlined three significant unfulfilled potential in crypto that he intends to achieve: <strong>large-scale crypto wallet usage; development of inflation-resistant stablecoins; and increased popularity of Ethereum-based applications.</strong></p>



<p>Vitalik Buterin views<strong> the establishment of a stablecoin</strong> as the process of establishing more crypto wallet infrastructure to make it easy for everyone to use and ensure that the product is capable of taking on billions of users. It will be a revolution for the industry if it is <strong>inflation-resistant, internationally accessible, and robust</strong> to all kinds of conditions that occur, both <strong>on-chain and in the broader macro-economy</strong>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;If we can establish a stablecoin that can actually live in a number of settings, including the growing inflation in the US dollar, it opens up a lifeline for everyone to overcome.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Finally, the Ethereum founder stated that any <strong>technical breakthroughs</strong> that contribute to Ethereum removing login privileges from Facebook, Google, Twitter, and other centralized monopolies will allow Ethereum to finally take over. More market dominance in Internet-based apps.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Imagine being able to log in with Ethereum to work and replace Facebook, Google, and Twitter as the *rulers* of the Internet; isn&#8217;t that a great opportunity?&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However, it appears that, in the context of &#8220;freezing,&#8221; Vitalik Buterin has more to say about <strong>his aspirations</strong> for the industry in the near future, in an effort to bolster those who are presently working and continue to follow the market.</p>



<p>Not only did the Ethereum founder do an in-depth interview with Bankless, but he also published an article on his own page <strong>in early December 2022</strong> to share his knowledge and advice with the blockchain community regarding the approaching years.</p>
