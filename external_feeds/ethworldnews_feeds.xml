<ul><li>Genesis Global Capital is reportedly preparing to file for bankruptcy.</li><li>The DCG subsidiary has been in negotiations with several creditor groups.&nbsp;</li><li>Genesis has been struggling to raise funds for its lending unit following a liquidity crunch.&nbsp;</li><li>Parent firm Digital Currency Group suspended dividends today due to liquidity issues with subsidiaries.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Genesis Global Capital, one of the most popular subsidiaries of the Digital Currency Group (<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/dcg-asset-sales-genesis-owes-3-billion/">DCG</a>), is reportedly preparing to file for bankruptcy as soon as this week. This crypto lending subsidiary of the Digital Currency Group has been attempting to raise funds to maintain liquidity ever since FTX’s collapse caused it to halt withdrawals in November 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Genesis in confidential negotiations with creditors</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-18/crypto-firm-genesis-said-to-prepare-bankruptcy-filing-as-soon-as-this-week" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, Genesis Global Capital has engaged multiple creditor groups in negotiations amid liquidity issues that have spilled over to parent firm Digital Currency Group. The crypto broker had indicated in November 2022 that a bankruptcy filing may be imminent unless fresh capital was raised to sustain operations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>People close to the matter have stated that a bankruptcy filing may not be necessary and that plans could change. As per a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.theblock.co/post/203310/genesis-creditors-negotiating-prepackaged-bankruptcy-sources" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a>&nbsp;by The Block, creditors of Genesis are actively involved in negotiating the terms of a possible chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. Sources revealed that creditors may agree to a forbearance period between 1-2 years under a prepackaged bankruptcy plan in exchange for cash payments and equity in the Digital Currency Group.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DCG&#8217;s founder and CEO Barry Silbert has been involved in a public feud with Gemini’s co-founder and President Cameron Winklevoss. The latter’s customers are allegedly owed more than $900 million as part of Gemini&#8217;s Earn Program. The non-payment has dragged Silbert into the limelight following a series of open letters published by Cameron Winklevoss.</p>



<p>People familiar with the matter have stated that the communication regarding the bankruptcy filing is ongoing and may change. Genesis’ parent firm Digital Currency Group revealed earlier today that it would be suspending its quarterly&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-18/digital-currency-group-halts-dividend-payment-to-conserve-cash" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">dividends</a>&nbsp;to preserve cash following liquidity issues with its subsidiaries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>A second Substack post from the FTX Founder contested data and financial records filed by legal firm Sullivan &amp; Cromwell.</li><li>Bankman-Fried argued against the notion that FTX US has a shortfall and is unable to pay back customers.</li><li>The platform has over $350 million in excess cash, said SBF once again.  </li></ul>



<p>Disgraced crypto tycoon Sam Bankman-Fried reiterated that FTX US, the American division of his bankrupt international crypto exchange, remains solvent with enough cash and assets to make customers whole.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bankman-Fried argued against court records filed by legal firm Sullivan &amp; Cromwell which claimed that the U.S. exchange had a shortfall and was insolvent. The documents filed by Sullivan &amp; Cromwell directly contrast SBF’s rhetoric of healthy financial holdings at FTX US.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>S&amp;C claims that FTX US has a shortfall. That claim is false. Based on S&amp;C’s own data provided in the same court presentation, FTX US had roughly $609m of assets ($428m USD in bank accounts, plus $181m of tokens) backing roughly $199m of customer balances. FTX US was solvent when it was turned over to S&amp;C, and almost certainly remains solvent today.</p></blockquote>



<p>In his second Substack post after a “<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-premortem/">pre-mortem</a>” analysis on January 12, Sam Bankman-Fried once again opined that FTX US was solvent when he handed over to the bankruptcy team on November 12. SBF also noted that the U.S. platform holds at least $111 million of excess cash and over $350 million to cover customer deposits. </p>



<p>“Customers should be given access to their funds,” said Sam Bankman-Fried in his latest Substack post, expressing annoyance that users have not received their crypto and assets. Notably, Bankman-Fried also <a href="https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1615555252962627584?s=20&amp;t=uBmpEg5coaQJ7oy6rPIZRg" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> there isn’t enough information to actually prove that. </p>



<h2>FTX Discovers Another $90 Millon Missing</h2>



<p>The bankrupt crypto exchange reported that about $181 million in liquid assets from the American exchange have been identified so far. Of the total sum, $88 million was moved to cold storage wallet controlled by debtors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Around $3 million was also earmarked for cold storage, said the bankruptcy team. About $90 million remains unaccounted for at press time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Previous reports <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-5-billion-recovered-in-crypto-assets/">stated</a> that around $5 billion in cash, crypto, and securities were recovered. However, it remains unclear if this figure includes nearly $400 million <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/u-s-doj-launches-probe-into-372-million-ftx-hack-following-bankruptcy-filing/">stolen</a> from the exchange, $3.5 billion in the <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/3-5-billion-ftx-customer-crypto-bahamas/">hands</a> of Bahamian authorities, and roughly $450 million worth of Robinhood shares <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicholasreimann/2023/01/04/feds-move-to-seize-ftxs-robinhood-shares-as-sam-bankman-fried-faces-fraud-charges/" rel="noopener">seized</a> by the U.S. Department of Justice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Users have until February 16 to withdraw their assets from the exchange or risk legal headaches.</li><li>Coinbase will close fiat deposits by January 20 as the company winds down operations in Japan.</li><li>The news follows three separate staff cuts with over 2,000 employees fired from the company due to market conditions. </li></ul>



<p>Major crypto exchange Coinbase announced a “difficult decision” to shut down its operations in Japan due to harsh market conditions hitting the crypto ecosystem and the broader financial industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company initially disclosed plans to tap the Japanese market in 2016, before later teaming up with the global giant Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group to realize its plans in 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now the exchange advised users to <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/halting-operations-in-japan" rel="nofollow noopener">withdraw</a> their crypto from the exchange roughly two years after launching services for the crypto market in Japan. According to Wednesday’s announcement, local account holders have until February 16 to withdraw their digital assets in either crypto or fiat currency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assets on the exchange after February 17 will be converted to Japanese Yen (JPY) and users with active balances will have to engage the Legal Affairs Bureau for a resolution, Coinbase said. Also, the option to deposit fiat on the exchange will be disabled by January 20.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Any remaining crypto holdings held on Coinbase on or after February 17th will be converted to JPY. In the month following February 17th, Coinbase will send any remaining JPY to a Guaranty Account at the Legal Affairs Bureau in accordance with legal requirements. If customers do not take any action before February 16th, they will have to coordinate with the Legal Affairs Bureau to retrieve their JPY balance.</p></blockquote>



<h2>Coinbase Rocked By Layoffs&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Indeed, Coinbase <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-investors-cheer-6-stock-surge-following-950-job-cut-announcement/">announced</a> another round of staff cuts in early January 2023 as the crypto exchange doubled down to survive the crypto blizzard. The company effectively fired over 2,000 workers since 2022 and rescinded job offers in some cases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The broader crypto ecosystem was shaken by several industry failures like Terra and FTX which drove down asset prices across the board. Other crypto entities like Kraken and Gemini also reduced their workforce to manage resources.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, beaten crypto prices and industry shakedowns did little to deter Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest from backing Coinbase. The investment giant deployed $5.8 million to <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/cathie-woods-ark-invest-demonstrates-confidence-in-coinbase-with-another-5-8-million-share-purchase/">purchase</a> more COIN stock, bringing the company’s portfolio to a staggering 8.7 million shares.</p>

<ul><li>HashKey Capital has concluded a $500 million funding round for its third crypto fund. </li><li>The Hong Kong-based firm plans to invest in crypto and blockchain ventures around the world. </li><li>The asset manager has invested in popular projects like Polkadot, 1inch, etc. </li><li>The new crypto fund comes amid a brutal crypto winter that has discouraged other institutions from investing. </li></ul>



<p>HashKey Capital, the Hong Kong-based investing subsidiary of the HashKey Group, unveiled a new crypto fund earlier today. The asset investment firm revealed that it had secured a whopping $500 million in committed capital for what will be its third such investment fund.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>HashKey Fintech Investment Fund III</strong></h2>



<p>The HashKey Fintech Investment Fund III is set to invest in crypto and blockchain projects around the world with a war chest worth $500 million. According to a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.hashkey.com/en/newsroom/hashkey-capital-announces-close-fund-III-500-million-to-build-web-3" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release</a>&nbsp;from the HashKey Group, the latest fund will be deployed to increase crypto adoption around the globe, particularly in emerging economies.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Fund III will provide investors with institutional-grade exposure to all facets of blockchain and crypto technologies. This new fund aims to invest primarily in infrastructures, toolings, and applications that have potential for mass adoption.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Since its founding in 2018, HashKey Capital has managed over $1 billion in client assets. The firm has invested in popular crypto projects including Polkadot, DeFi exchange 1inch, and layer 2 network Aztec. It was one of the earliest institutional investors in Ethereum, whose latest Shanghai upgrade was reportedly named after the investment firm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The investment fund’s launch comes at a time when institutions around the world are discouraged by the prolonged <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/nft-marketplace-superrare-downsizes-30-of-staff-due-to-extended-crypto-winter/">crypto winter</a>. However, the turmoil in the crypto market seems to have no effect on the Hong Kong-based asset manager. According to CEO Deng Chao, the firm has weathered at least three cycles in the crypto industry and each one has left the firm with experiences and insights that are coming in handy. </p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>Validators on the network increased from 428,000 around September 15 when Ethereum upgrade from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake.</li><li>The news comes ahead of staked Ether withdrawals expected to roll out with the Shanghai update in March 2023.</li><li>Validators have staked over 16 million ETH worth roughly $25 billion with Ether trading around $1500 on Tuesday.</li></ul>



<p>According to BeaconScan data, the number of validators on Ethereum surpassed 500,000 on Tuesday. The news marked a landmark moment for the leading altcoin blockchain as anticipation for staked Ether (ETH) withdrawals grows. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="945" height="1024" src="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/validators-945x1024.png" alt="Ethereum Validators Cross 500,000 Post-Merge 6" class="wp-image-580561" srcset="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/validators-945x1024.png 945w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/validators-277x300.png 277w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/validators-770x834.png 770w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/validators-269x291.png 269w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/validators-746x808.png 746w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/validators.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 945px) 100vw, 945px" title="Ethereum Validators Cross 500,000 Post-Merge 11"></figure>



<p>Validators are a key component of Ethereum’s network after the Merge which switched ETH’s chain from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus to a proof-of-stake (PoS). Similar to miners on a PoW blockchain, validators are responsible for confirming transactions and maintaining network security among other crucial PoS blockchain needs. </p>



<p>Ethereum core developers said the withdrawal function for staked ETH should roll out with a post-merge update dubbed Shanghai slated for March 2023. ETH engineers released a testing area called “devnet 2” to allow client and validator teams to test the withdrawal process before the feature goes live in a few weeks. </p>



<p>Interested clients were required to deposit a minimum of 32 ETH before becoming Ethereum Validators. The deposit worth approximately $50,000 at today&#8217;s prices was then locked up in a <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000219ab540356cbb839cbe05303d7705fa" data-type="URL" data-id="https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000219ab540356cbb839cbe05303d7705fa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">staking contract</a>, allowing clients to earn rewards and other perks when withdrawals become possible.</p>

<h2>16 Million ETH Staked Ahead of Ethereum’s Shanghai Upgrade</h2>



<p>The staked ETH contract which launched in 2020 held over 16 million Ether on Tuesday, per data from EtherScan. ETH traded around $1500, pegging the massive locked ETH at a valuation north of $25 billion. The 16 million staked ETH also accounts for about 13.28% of the leading altcoin’s total supply.</p>



<p>Nansen data highlighted over 92,000 unique staking depositors as of January 12. Furthermore, liquid staking protocol <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ethereums-shanghai-upgrade-brings-heat-to-liquid-staking-derivatives-lsd-with-ldo-seeing-71-increase-in-value/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ethereums-shanghai-upgrade-brings-heat-to-liquid-staking-derivatives-lsd-with-ldo-seeing-71-increase-in-value/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lido Finance</a> was the top depositor with around 4.6 million ETH staked via the platform. </p>



<p>Major crypto exchanges Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance also featured on the top five staked ETH depositors, per Nansen. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Founding team members also include Co-Founders of troubled exchange CoinFLEX, Mark Lamb, and Sudgu Arumugam.</li><li>The GTX exchange will allow users to trade claims for defunct crypto companies like BlockFi, Celsius, FTX, and Mt.

<p>Three Arrows Capital (3AC) Co-Founders Su Zhu and Kyle Davies are pitching to investors in a bid to raise $25 million in seed funding for a new cryptocurrency exchange dubbed GTX.</p>



<p>According to the pitch proposal, GTX will allow crypto users to tap into a $20 billion crypto claims market featuring beleaguered entities like BlockFi, Celsius, FTX, and Mt.Gox among others. This means that GTX hopes to offer crypto bankruptcy claims trading. The platform also plans to enter the $2 trillion stock securities lending market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>WuBlockchain’s team confirmed the news with Su Zhu, Co-Founder of the defunct crypto hedge fund 3AC, who said “yes, no comment, just busy building it&#8221;. The team also includes CoinFLEX Co-Founders Mark Lamb and Sudhu Arumugam. </p>



<p>Notably, CoinFLEX buckled under contagion from Terra’s crash in 2022. The platform also <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinflex-resumes-crypto-trading-with-limited-withdrawals-of-up-to-10-of-user-funds/">limited</a> withdrawals in July and <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinflex-lays-off-a-significant-portion-of-its-team-to-reduce-costs-by-50-60/">fired</a> a chunk of its team. </p>



<p>Former Head of Institutional Sales at Amber Group Leslie Lamb will serve as GTX’s Chief Marketing Officer, and Kent Dog who previously worked at Alibaba features as Chief Technology Officer for the new venture. </p>

<h2>3AC Founders Back In The Game</h2>



<p>The news about GTX’s pitch to investors comes months after crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital blew up in mid-2022. Co-Founder Su Zhu and Kyle Davies <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/three-arrows-capital-liquidators-jailtime/">disappeared</a> in the aftermath, with reports claiming the pair flew to Dubai.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both Zhu and Davies alleged that their long positions were hunted by Alameda Research. The pair also <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/alameda-collapse-three-arrows-capital/">claimed</a> that Sam Bankman-Fried’s companies played a role in 3AC’s collapse, although the disgraced FTX Founder denied the allegations</p>



<p>Several watchdogs including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) started investigating 3AC and its founders for financial malpractice and defrauding investors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On January 5, 2023, Zhu and Davies were <a href="https://twitter.com/3ACLiq/status/1610999697983815686?s=20&amp;t=njpXmcU2yBkal_sEfuct6w" rel="nofollow noopener">subpoenaed</a> on social network Twitter as their whereabouts remain unknown to the court and liquidators.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Lazarus Group, the notorious hacking outfit based in North Korea, transferred millions of dollars to multiple crypto exchanges over the past weekend. According to an update from popular blockchain investigator&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1614771861266792449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1614771861266792449%7Ctwgr%5Ec94232ec8379cfb68390e5ef897ac15264c670c2%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coindesk.com%2Ftech%2F2023%2F01%2F16%2Fnorth-korean-hacking-group-tied-to-100m-harmony-hack-moves-41000-ether-over-weekend%2F" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ZachXBT</a>, the hacker group moved 41,000 ETH worth more than $63 million from the Harmony bridge hack to three crypto exchanges, namely Binance, Huobi, and OKX.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Lazarus Group’s funds frozen by Binance</strong></h2>



<p>The North Korean hacker group used Railgun before depositing the exploited funds on the crypto exchanges. Railgun is a privacy platform built on Ethereum which is used for anonymity while making crypto transactions. The crypto sleuth revealed a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.chainabuse.com/report/0a2e8e00-00e2-4749-9b00-ceb1c6202d33" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">list</a>&nbsp;of 350 wallet addresses associated with the hackers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Coinbase Director Conor Grogan spotted Ether transfers to the &#8220;FTX Accounts Drainer&#8221; with private notes on how to move the assets undetected.</li><li>The hacker was advised to leverage less popular and more privacy-based crypto mixer protocols.</li><li>The U.S. Justice Department launched an investigation into the matter after nearly $400 million was stolen from Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s bankrupt crypto exchange. </li></ul>



<p>In a bizarre turn of events, the FTX hacker who drained roughly $400 million in digital assets from Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto exchange received tips on how to launder the stolen funds using mixing protocols. </p>



<p>Coinbase Director Conor Grogan noticed Ether (ETH) transfers to the wallet labeled “FTX Account Drainer” on the block explorer Etherscan. The transaction carried a message directing the hacker on how to launder their massive lot. </p>



<p>In the text, the sender suggested using more privacy-focused crypto mixing services rather than popular protocols like ChipMixer. Crypto mixers allow users to obfuscate their transactions when moving assets around and are a common tool used by crypto criminals attempting to launder their illicit wealth. </p>



<p>The sender also offered to share more information with the hacker on suitable crypto mixers, providing their telegram username should the hacker wish to contact them. Director Grogan likened the attempt to a sales cold call. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">People are sending the FTX exploiter trace amounts of ETH along with a message on how to better launder the funds.

</div></figure>



<p>Notably, the sender also registered a peculiar Ethereum Name Service (ENS) address with more instructions for the hacker to consider &#8211; *swap-gray-crypto-for-white-stablecoins-check-input-data-utf8.eth”</p>



<h2>FTX Hack Investigated By Justice Department</h2>



<p>The U.S. Department of Justice <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/u-s-doj-launches-probe-into-372-million-ftx-hack-following-bankruptcy-filing/">launched</a> investigations into a $400 million hack on FTX, as previously reported in later December 2022. Led by the DoJ’s National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team, authorities said the criminal investigation would probe the identity of the hacker or hackers who drained Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and other digital assets from SBF’s crypto exchange shortly after the company declared bankruptcy on November 12.</p>



<p>Disgraced Founder Sam Bankman-Fried denied ties to the hack on several occasions, claiming he did not “stash away millions and billions in crypto” in his latest “Pre-mortem” analysis on <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-premortem/">Substack</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apart from eight criminal charges slammed against Bankman-Fried by U.S. authorities, federal prosecutors are also investigating SBF’s ‘inner circle’ including ex-CTO Gary Wang and former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison. Both Ellison and Wang already <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2022/12/23/caroline-ellison-admits-she-and-bankman-fried-conspired-to-steal-from-ftx-customers-and-mislead-investors-reports-say/" rel="noopener">flipped</a> on Bankman-Fried, pleading guilty to fraud in exchange for plea deals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prosecutors also met with FTX’s former chief engineer Nishad Singh to <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-nishad-singh-deal-sdny-prosecutors/">weigh</a> his information regarding the crypto exchange’s multi-billion crash in 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A new blockchain platform, <a href="https://blog.shibaswap.com/introduction-to-shibarium/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://blog.shibaswap.com/introduction-to-shibarium/" rel="nofollow noopener">Shibarium</a>, is set to launch as a solution for high gas fees on the Ethereum network from the Shiba Inu team. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">🍖 Introduction to Shibarium: Shiba Inu&#39;s Layer 2 Network — Rejoice <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ShibArmy?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">#ShibArmy</a>! Shibarium Beta is about to be launched, and through this article we want to introduce some basic concepts in order to provide clarity to the community.<br><br>Read more: <a href="https://t.co/xWyPaVlQQ4" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/xWyPaVlQQ4</a></p>&mdash; Shib (@Shibtoken) <a href="https://twitter.com/Shibtoken/status/1614754575604400132?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">January 15, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The launch of Shibarium is to solve a common barrier for users looking to make small transactions in their day-to-day lives, with added fees of $50-$100 on top of a fractional $15 purchase, making it impractical and unrealistic for many to use these digital assets in their daily transactions.</p>



<p>Shibarium is a Layer 2 blockchain, meaning that transactions occur &#8220;off-chain&#8221; and are communicated back to the Ethereum blockchain. This allows the Shibarium blockchain to handle the majority of the processing work, which in turn reduces bandwidth and lowers costs and processing time for users.</p>



<p>Beyond the cost and speed benefits, Shibarium&#8217;s development framework provides robust functionality to allow the community to build their vision into the blockchain. Decentralized Applications (dApps) are a critical component of the expansion of Web 3, and their uses are nearly endless. Gaming, social media, education, and supply chains are just a few of the many potential uses for dApps on Shibarium.</p>



<p>The platform also supports Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) with the ability to create chain-specific NFTs. These tokens can be used for a variety of applications such as event tickets, in-game items, art and music, and digital real estate.</p>



<h2>Shibarium and $Bone</h2>



<p>Shibarium, the highly anticipated Layer 2 blockchain platform, has also announced that its native token, $BONE, will be used to pay for gas transactions and reward validators and delegators within the protocol. </p>



<p>Since its launch in July 2021, the main function of $BONE has been linked to governance, but, according to the team, it will now also play a crucial role in the upcoming Shibarium launch.</p>



<p>Validators and Delegators are assigned a percentage of a token called $BONE that are distributed each time a specific time is reached. They will also be given a portion of another token called TREAT. A commission is a fee taken by the validator for the operation and maintenance of the node. Rewards are distributed based on the amount of tokens staked by each of them, after validator commissions. </p>



<p>The total supply of $BONE is 250 million, with 20 million of those tokens reserved to reward validators and delegators in the coming years. The allocation of these tokens was determined through a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) process, which was voted on by the Shiba community.</p>



<p>$BONE can currently be obtained through ShibaSwap and other decentralized and centralized platforms, and its contract address is: </p>



<p>0x9813037ee2218799597d83d4a5b6f3b6778218d9.</p>



<p>As the launch of Shibarium approaches, $BONE is expected to gain more attention and adoption as it will be at the forefront of gas transactions and rewards within the protocol. </p>

<ul><li>Société Générale has minted a loan of $7 million worth of DAI from MakerDAO.&nbsp;</li><li>The investment firm used home loan bonds as collateral to withdraw the stablecoins.&nbsp;</li><li>Société Générale started a vault in the DAO last year after approval from its community.</li></ul>



<p>French investment banking giant Société Générale took a significant step towards blockchain adoption earlier today when it withdrew millions worth of stablecoins from MakerDAO. The investment bank, which boasts over 130,000 employees spread across 62 countries, tapped its MakerDAO wallet to&nbsp;<a href="https://makerburn.com/?continueFlag=22783de146e77a59faa4664ef13ba7a0#/collateral/RWA008-A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">withdraw</a>&nbsp;$7 million worth of DAI. The move is being seen as a significant step to bridge traditional finance (TradFi) with decentralized finance (DeFi).&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>I’m not actually sure why it took them so long to use the vault, except that my experience with these real-world asset things is that everything always takes a long time,”</p><cite>MakerDAO delegate and crypto researcher Mika Honkasalo.&nbsp;</cite></blockquote>



<h2><strong>Home loan bonds used as collateral for the loan from MakerDAO</strong></h2>



<p>This is arguably the biggest direct transaction between a firm from TradFi and a DeFi project. Société Générale reportedly used home loan bonds worth $40 million as collateral to service the $7 million debt from MakerDAO. The loan was drawn from the investment firm’s vault in the decentralized autonomous organization, which was approved by its community late last year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the time the&nbsp;<a href="https://forum.makerdao.com/t/security-tokens-refinancing-mip6-application-for-ofh-tokens/10605" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">proposal</a>&nbsp;was described as the “first experiment at the crossroads between regulated and open source initiatives”. The proposal was passed with an overwhelming majority, with over 83% of the&nbsp;<a href="https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmajCtnG#vote-breakdown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">votes</a>&nbsp;in favor of Société Générale starting a vault in the <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/makerdao-voting-on-500m-investment-plan/">DAO</a>. The vault reportedly has a debt ceiling of $30 million.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interestingly, this is not MakerDAO’s first TradFi venture. In July 2022, it approved a $100 million stablecoin loan vault for&nbsp;<a href="https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmQMDasC#vote-breakdown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Huntingdon Valley Bank</a>. This proposal was also passed with a unanimous vote from the community. Huntingdon Valley Bank’s debt ceiling was set at $100 million, with the provision to extend it to a billion dollars over 12 months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Société Générale’s loan from MakerDAO only goes on to demonstrate the use cases that DeFi has to offer to the firms operating in traditional finance.</p>
