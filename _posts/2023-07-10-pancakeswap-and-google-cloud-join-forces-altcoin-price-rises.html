Dysnix&#8217;s PreditKube solution helped PancakeSwap accurately predict traffic spikes and automate the up-and-down scaling of blockchain nodes ahead of time to manage the anticipated traffic surge. This approach ensured that PancakeSwap&#8217;s infrastructure could handle a fluctuating number of requests with high scalability, maintaining an uptime of 99.99%.

By automating the up-and-down scaling of nodes, PancakeSwap managed the anticipated traffic surge and reduced its infrastructure costs by more than 30%.  One of the critical challenges for any trading platform is ensuring the security of smart contracts. PancakeSwap works with various audit firms to identify potential loopholes and leverages Cloud Armor to filter sensitive data.  With its smart contracts secured, PancakeSwap aims to expand its services by adding more chains and exploring non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Moreover, to improve users&#8217; trading experience, PancakeSwap plans to leverage BigQuery to manage and analyze historical blockchain data. By simplifying complex data, PancakeSwap aims to make blockchain trading accessible to everyone.  With Google Cloud&#8217;s fully managed services, PancakeSwap&#8217;s engineers can focus on developing new features and improving the user experience rather than dealing with infrastructure issues. Chef Jojo, Technical Lead at PancakeSwap, stated: At one point, we had more than one billion requests on the BNB Chain, but this is changing all the time due to the BNB network changes, among other variables. With Google Kubernetes Engine, we can quickly scale up when there are many requests.
