										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Crypto is likely to be a big topic in next year’s presidential election, and republican candidate Vivek Ramaswamy is <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/gop-presidential-candidate-vivek-ramaswamy-bets-big-on-bitcoin-in-2024/ar-AA1bqgQ1" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">proof of this</a>.</p>
<h2>Vivek Ramaswamy is Making Crypto Part of His Presidential Policy</h2>
<p>In a recent interview, Ramaswamy commented that he’s not only accepting bitcoin donations to his campaign, but he’s also looking to unveil new regulations that will lessen the taxation of crypto mining companies. He commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>The thriving bitcoin universe should actually better empower me to do what I want to do as the U.S. president, which is to stabilize the U.S. dollar as a unit of measurement and put the Federal Reserve back in its place with that as its single mandate.</p></blockquote>
<p>His comments come after Joe Biden <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/biden-wants-to-tax-crypto-mining-companies-at-30/" data-wpel-link="internal">commented that he was looking</a> to implement a 30 percent tax rate on all crypto mining companies as a means of limiting their energy usage and promoting positive climate change tactics.</p>
<p>Not long ago, President Donald Trump unveiled a string of new <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63995563" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">non-fungible tokens</a> (NFTs) and made more than $1 million in profit through the sale of said digital assets. Ramaswamy has commented that he’s not looking to unveil new NFTs of his own anytime soon. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Right now, I&#8217;m more focused on policy. It also just gives people the choice to donate to the campaign in bitcoin and signal that we&#8217;re not threatened by it.</p></blockquote>
<p>More than anything, he wants crypto miners to be able to perform their duties freely in America. He doesn’t want the United States to become <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-crypto-mining-clampdown-in-china-is-not-over/" data-wpel-link="internal">the next China</a>, which ultimately made all crypto activity illegal about two years back. Regarding Biden’s mining taxation plans, Ramaswamy said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think that it&#8217;s wrong and unfair and is not an appropriate use of federal power.</p></blockquote>
<p>He stated that he feels the taxation will ultimately limit innovation and prevent entrepreneurship from thriving in the digital currency arena. He mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;ll put that into the rules and preserve freedom to mine by rescinding and committing against any special taxes for the utilization of energy for purposes of mining.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Will Bitcoin Be a Payment Tool in the U.S.?</h2>
<p>He was also quick to mention that the U.S. dollar has been severely crippled under Biden and that assets like bitcoin could eventually become valid alternative payment methods in the U.S. should the dollar continue to thin and weaken. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The insecurities that the defenders of fiat money have with respect to the rise of bitcoin is similar to the insecurities that I see amongst public schools and the teachers’ unions and the administrators of public schools with respect to school choice. I will be the opposite of what public schools are to school choice.</p></blockquote>
<p>Right now, the U.S. has taken a very anti-crypto attitude given regulators like Gary Gensler – head of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) – are <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-sec-wants-more-funds-to-go-after-crypto-companies/" data-wpel-link="internal">working to persecute</a> every crypto company they come across.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman named Sarita divorced her husband a few years back. Nothing seemed odd at first; people get divorced all the time. However, <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/a-husband-hid-500000-in-bitcoin-during-a-divorce-and-got-busted-by-a-crypto-hunter/ar-AA1btUrt" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">when her husband</a> (who makes $3 million per year) declared no assets, she became suspicious.</p>
<h2>Sarita Discovers Her Ex-Spouse&#8217;s Hidden Crypto Stash</h2>
<p>Following a year of discovery, Sarita found out that her husband had at least half a million in assorted <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/crypto/" data-wpel-link="internal">crypto</a> funds to his name and didn’t declare them in the divorce proceedings. By not reporting them, he figured he could get away with smaller alimony payments or something along those lines, but it appears this deception has now worked against him.</p>
<p>Sarita – which is an alias for the woman – says she was married to her husband for over a decade. She said she was quite shocked when she found out about her ex’s digital holdings, mentioning in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>I know of bitcoin and things like that. I just didn’t know much about it. It was never even a thought in my mind because it’s not like we were discussing it or making investments together&#8230; It was a shock.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many divorce attorneys say crypto holdings are often difficult to locate or realize during separation proceedings in that many of the laws have not kept up with the digital assets arena. Thus, one can easily hide said assets during a divorce and get away with it, granted their former spouse or their lawyer aren’t privy to the way things work.</p>
<p>Kim Nutter says she was one of the first lawyers in her native state of Florida to begin exploring crypto practices in 2015. She commented that she’s worked hard to ensure all sides of the divorce table are required to relay their digital holdings during separation proceedings. She said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I still think the law is trying to catch up with this novel form of currency, even though it’s been around for quite a while. What I find in litigation is because this is so new to all of us, even the most seasoned attorneys, unless you’re really going out of your way to study this, educating the court, knowing what to ask for, and finding the right experts, it’s much more of a scramble to me than other areas of law which had been around much longer.</p></blockquote>
<h2>A Lot of Crypto in Divorce Proceedings, Now</h2>
<p>Divorce attorney Kelly Burris also threw her two cents in, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you have a spouse that’s very tech savvy and one that isn’t, it can be somewhat easy to hide those assets. The thing with cryptocurrency is it’s not regulated by any kind of centralized bank, so usually you can’t subpoena somebody and get documents and information related to somebody’s cryptocurrency holdings.</p></blockquote>
<p>She says that 40 to 50 percent of her divorce cases now involve crypto.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin payments company Strike has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/05/21/whos-laughing-now-bitcoin-price-braced-for-3-billion-user-shock-as-strike-ceo-slams-coinbase-ethereum-bnb-xrp-cardano-dogecoin-polygon-and-solana/?sh=3e5f3bcbe501" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">anticipated that it will grow</a> across 65 countries in the coming years and expand its list of clients to roughly three billion souls.</p>
<h2>Strike Wants a Change of Scenery</h2>
<p>Jack Mallers – CEO of the Chicago-based company – explained in a recent interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>We think there are billions of people that want a money app with those characteristics and capabilities contrasted to a clouded world of crypto exchanges and hidden, unregistered licensing regimes and 1,000 different coins.</p></blockquote>
<p>Strike says it’s also going to be moving its headquarters to El Salvador, the Central American nation that has proven very bitcoin friendly over the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-fully-legal-in-el-salvador-beginning-september-7/" data-wpel-link="internal">past two years given</a> it was the first to label the world’s largest digital currency as legal tender. This means that many companies are now required to accept it as a method of payment alongside USD, which the country has long depended on.</p>
<p>Mallers continued with:</p>
<blockquote><p>Two years ago, people would have made fun of me [for our] headquarters in El Salvador to launch a product for three billion people, but now Coinbase is fighting with [Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair] Gary Gensler. Who’s laughing now?</p></blockquote>
<p>He is, of course, referring to a situation in which a Wells notice <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-receives-wells-notice-from-the-sec/" data-wpel-link="internal">was sent to Coinbase</a>, America’s leading digital currency exchange, citing potential securities violations that the company would be tried for. The company took serious issue with the notice given, according to executive statements, it had met with representatives of the SEC several times over a nine-year period to ensure compliance. Mallers said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think bitcoin stands alone [in] just how obvious it is that it is owned by nobody. Every other instrument in this industry has a founding team, a foundation, and they issued some [tokens] privately and handed them out in auctions before they went live, and that sounds a lot more like a security.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mallers also mentioned that his company chose USDT (Tether) over Circle and Coinbase’s USDC stable currency given that he feels people outside of the United States don’t really “trust” the former company. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>If I’m being totally honest, Circle is built for American institutions.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Circle may not be appreciated outside of American institutions, Tether has raised quite a bit of controversy over the years and is <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/stable-coin-tether-buys-over-200-million-worth-of-btc/" data-wpel-link="internal">continuing to do so with</a> its recent announcement that it’s purchased loads of BTC.</p>
<h2>Trying to Make the App Better</h2>
<p>Maneula Rios – the vice president of product with Strike – said the company is also focusing on making its app more user friendly. Rios said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our end goal is to address the seven to eight billion people in every single country. If you are in the United States, the apps are gorgeous. There&#8217;s a high bar for design. Unfortunately, that&#8217;s not the case when you download apps abroad.</p></blockquote>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The nation of Pakistan has issued a <a href="https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2023/05/207337-crypto-ban-pakistan-is-reportedly-drafting-legislation-to-prohibit-cryptocurrency-transactions/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">warning that it’s going</a> to look into potentially banning crypto.</p>
<h2>Will Pakistan End All Crypto Activity?</h2>
<p>The news came by way of Pakistan Minister of State for Finance and Revenue Aisha Ghaus Pasha, who said in a recent Senate session that his country has no interest in legalizing crypto trading at any point. Right now, this is all widely speculative, and nothing is set in stone. In addition, the statements are coming from political officials, who change their minds as often as you might eat breakfast.</p>
<p>At the same time, if Pakistan were to move forward and ban all crypto trading and related activity, it would likely have atrocious effects on the country. One of the most devastating outcomes would be that Pakistan would easily fall behind when it comes to technological advancements.</p>
<p>Right now, blockchain is exploding like it never has before. There are also many countries and continents doing all they can to ensure crypto regulation is in place so that people can at least remain protected if they’re going to engage in crypto investing.</p>
<p>For example, the European Union (EU) has just passed a string of regulations <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/european-union-passes-heavy-string-of-new-crypto-regulations/" data-wpel-link="internal">known as MiCA designed</a> to ensure all crypto trading is clear, safe, and straightforward in European nations. While the framework isn’t necessarily perfect and leaves a lot of stones unturned, it is at least a step in the right direction, and there will probably be changes and additions made to these regulations in the coming future.</p>
<p>In Pakistan, it’s likely that people are going to engage in crypto trading anyway, whether the government allows them to or not. The fact is that Pakistan is still considered a developing nation, and thus the introduction of crypto could arguably aid the nation from a financial perspective like it could all Middle Eastern regions.</p>
<p>If regulators are to get in the way of innovation like this, the country will suffer because people who are looking to trade either way will not be protected as they do so. Furthermore, the nation is likely to fall behind regions such as the EU, which have accepted that crypto is a staple of the future and are moving forward with rules that will allow easier integration and practices.</p>
<h2>Who Supports This?</h2>
<p>Pasha’s comments are currently receiving support from other regulatory bodies in the country including the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and its director Sohail Jawad. Pasha also stated that banning crypto was one of the requirements established by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Currently, the FATF has not officially acted upon this, suggesting – at least in Pasha’s eyes – that the agency hasn’t done its job.</p>
<p>Some countries – like China – have already <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-crypto-mining-clampdown-in-china-is-not-over/" data-wpel-link="internal">taken measures</a> to ensure all crypto activity is banned.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jerome Powell – the man at the head of the table in the Federal Reserve chambers – is getting ready to offer what many <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/bitcoin-in-stasis-below-27k-ahead-of-powell-speech/ar-AA1bpvB8" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">analysts call another hawkish</a> speech, and they’re concerned about what his words could do to bitcoin and the rest of the crypto industry.</p>
<h2>The Federal Reserve is at It Again</h2>
<p>Over the past year or so, every time the Federal Reserve does anything, bitcoin seems to get affected. In 2022, for example, the Federal Reserve regularly <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/is-the-fed-bitcoins-worst-enemy-right-now/" data-wpel-link="internal">hiked interest rates</a> as a means of fighting ongoing, record-high inflation in America.</p>
<p>These rate hikes didn’t really do much in terms of lowering the surging prices the nation was seeing. However, they <em>did</em> cause crypto prices to tank like they never had before. Also, with so many working-class people unable to afford the interest, they were instantly cut out of the American dream and could no longer get their hands on cars, homes, or items that would require loans as part of the purchasing process.</p>
<p>Right now, Powell hasn’t even given the speech yet, and already we’re seeing bitcoin take a few dips here and there. Shortly after the event was announced, bitcoin fell into the high $26,000 range. Prior to that, it had been trading for about $27,000 per unit. Marc Chandler – chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex – commented in a recent market update:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hawkish comments from Fed officials and the first decline in continuing unemployment claims below 1.8 million in two months boosted U.S. rates, and the odds of a… rate hike rose to about 37 percent. This represents a near tripling of the probability in the past week.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is also wide speculation that the Federal Reserve will hike rates again if Congress cannot come to an agreement on the present issue surrounding the debt ceiling. Janet Yellen – the current Treasury Secretary – has <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/how-janet-yellen-and-the-debt-ceiling-are-making-btc-look-good/" data-wpel-link="internal">warned that if the debt</a> ceiling isn’t raised, the U.S. is going to run out of money and become a bankrupt nation.</p>
<p>Right now, the nation is facing $31 trillion in debt, and House republicans – led by Speaker Kevin McCarthy – have stated that pushing things higher will result in far too much debt falling onto the shoulders of American taxpayers, and they’re reluctant to do as Yellen asks.</p>
<h2>More Rate Hikes Coming?</h2>
<p>Granted no agreement is made, some – such as Craig Shapiro of La Duc Trading – believe the Fed may step in. Shapiro said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Seems like Powell needs to take the rate hike odds up again today in order to be prepared to go again… if the debt ceiling debacle is tabled for a short-term resolution. Data remains too good right now with the SEP likely to show a lower YE23 U rate and higher PCE, both of which suggest the dots for 24 are way too low.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man in Aurora, Colorado has been accused of <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/aurora-man-accused-of-9-million-cryptocurrency-theft/ar-AA1ble3a" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">stealing roughly $9 million</a> in crypto funds. 31-year-old Mark Shin has been charged with <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/theft/" data-wpel-link="internal">theft</a>, cybercrime, and money laundering at the time of writing for allegedly taking part in a scheme back in April of 2020 through his home computer.</p>
<h2>Mark Shin: Stealer or Advantage Taker?</h2>
<p>Shin is believed to have noticed an “unintended vulnerability in the revision 9 update” of the ICON Nation cryptocurrency. Instead of reporting this to ICON Foundation/Nation, court documents allege that Shin took part in a scheme that ultimately drained the network and made him an instant digital millionaire. The documents state:</p>
<blockquote><p>Shin changed the vote/select delegate function 558 times over an 11-hour period to mint unauthorized ICX. From his personal computer, Shin minted and stole from the ICON Nation approximately 13,924,045 unauthorized ICX, which was roughly the equivalent of approximately $8,988,406.00 U.S. dollars at the time of the attack.</p></blockquote>
<p>Chris Decker, a defense attorney, issued the following statement regarding his feelings on the case:</p>
<blockquote><p>I love this case. I think it’s fascinating.</p></blockquote>
<p>Shin is arguing that he did not engage in thievery, but rather saw a “golden opportunity” and chose to take advantage. Decker said of the matter:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Shin utilized the code that was written by this cryptocurrency to create his own mint or mint his own currency. So, he wasn’t taking property of another. He was creating new currency.</p></blockquote>
<p>George Brachler – legal analyst and former 18th Judicial District attorney – said this case is baffling and nothing like what he’s ever seen in nearly 30 years of serving the law. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ve only been doing this (legal work) [for] 28 years. I’ve never seen a case quite like this.</p></blockquote>
<p>He was also quick to say that he doesn’t think Shin’s argument of just trying to mint a new currency is going to be successful. He commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don’t think it will because he acts guilty. I mean, this guy doesn’t act like what he’s doing is above board. He creates a bunch of different accounts. He tries to take the cryptocurrency that he has ‘minted’ and sends it around to other crypto wallets to try to disguise who’s the owner and how much he has.</p></blockquote>
<p>Prosecutors are claiming that Shin used a spinning service called Tornado Cash to move all the money into other wallets to disguise where they originated from. Tornado Cash, at the time of writing, has been used to launder at least $7 billion. Shin said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The fact that I moved the money immediately after that is of no consequence to the fact that I minted it, and I didn’t steal it.</p></blockquote>
<h2>This Argument May Not Work</h2>
<p>Decker finished with:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think that this act undermines a general concern that people don’t quite understand how these programs work.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Something strange happened towards the latter half of May this year. While <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin</a> and Ethereum – two of the largest and most mainstream digital currencies – were taking price dips, altcoins – like XRP (Ripple) and Litecoin – <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/litecoin-xrp-and-other-altcoins-rise-wednesday-as-blue-chip-bitcoin-hits-a-lull/ar-AA1bk5EH" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">were exploding</a>.</p>
<h2>Altcoins Rose Last May While BTC Suffered</h2>
<p>During that time, Litecoin and Ripple endured price hikes of about five percent each, while others – like Sandbox – rose by as much as four percent. Axie also saw its price shoot up by a whopping eight percent. These numbers may not seem like much, but it’s unusual and interesting that this would happen, as these currencies often need to see bitcoin go up before they can follow suit.</p>
<p>The fact that they were able to travel in an entirely different price direction suggests that maybe the correlation between these assets and something larger like their daddy bitcoin are starting to thin out.</p>
<p>Some analysts believe this may have been the start of what they’re calling an “altcoin season.” This is typically when people (traders, investors, etc.) start to shift some of their attention away from larger, mainstream tokens like BTC and focus on smaller assets. As a result, these coins endure certain price hikes on a temporary basis, while some of the larger ones sink deeper into oblivion.</p>
<p>Still, the idea remains amongst many retail traders that bitcoin and Ethereum are “flight-to-safety” tokens, meaning that should things go wrong with the smaller tokens they invest in, they can always sell and allocate more of their wealth and portfolios to the latter two, thus bringing their statuses higher and giving themselves more stability.</p>
<p>One might assume that so long as bitcoin is there for them to enjoy, these investors feel safe enough to try other smaller coins out. Noelle Acheson – author of the “Crypto is Macro Now” newsletter – said that despite all this, volatility remains a problem in the industry at press time. She commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>Like macro markets, juggling resilient stock prices with increasingly bleak economic data points, the crypto market is also dealing with duality. There are some signs of frothiness.</p></blockquote>
<p>She also mentioned that despite the traction surrounding the mentioned altcoins, activity remains relatively low for these and other less-known digital currencies, and that in the long term, prices are still down and haven’t quite recovered from the 2022 bear market. She commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>In spite of these hints of froth, activity is low. Prices are down more than ten percent on the month, and volumes are trending lower.</p></blockquote>
<h2>BTC Is Not in the Best Place</h2>
<p>Bitcoin and Ethereum are also largely down despite small price jumps over the past five months.</p>
<p>BTC, for example, was trading in the mid-$16K range at the end of 2022. At the time of writing, the asset has moved into the $27K region, though this doesn’t compare to the $68,000 all-time high it achieved two Novembers ago.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kevin O’Leary of “Shark Tank” fame is worried about how the U.S. <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/cryptocurrency/stablecoins/bitcoin-miami-kevin-oleary-are-stablecoins-the-future-of-investment-funds" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">government is dealing with</a> crypto regulation. He says the federal government is less concerned about policy and more concerned with taking fast action, and this is coming back to hurt innovation.</p>
<h2>Kevin O&#8217;Leary: All the U.S. Needs is Policy</h2>
<p>Right now, he says policy is all the U.S. needs when it comes to crypto. He commented that the government doesn’t need to do anything fancy or special. It just needs to implement the right rules to ensure the industry is safe and sound for all. O’Leary stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m not looking for the federal government to provide innovation. I&#8217;m looking for them to provide policy. We don&#8217;t need them to develop anything. What we&#8217;ll do is license multiple stable coins, all backed by the U.S. dollar, and let them compete in the market.</p></blockquote>
<p>He also said he thinks it’s very important that more action be taken to ensure all crypto companies are running on clean energy. This is an attitude he’s held for quite some time, going so far as to say a few years back that he would cease <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/report-bitcoin-mining-may-require-more-energy-than-180-countries/" data-wpel-link="internal">buying any crypto mined</a> in China given the country’s poor history with renewable energy (this was long before the country <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-crypto-mining-clampdown-in-china-is-not-over/" data-wpel-link="internal">outlawed crypto and</a> mining activity).</p>
<p>O’Leary was adamant that if crypto companies continued to walk the path that they’ve been walking over the past several years, the planet is going to suffer heavily. He mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have to listen to these people and realize we can&#8217;t mine coins using carbon offsets. We&#8217;ve got to go hydro; we&#8217;ve got to go nuclear. I am so glad I had to sell every share I had in a company that uses carbon offsets, because I see the writing on the wall and it&#8217;s not pretty.</p></blockquote>
<p>O’Leary isn’t the only person that has this attitude. Over the years, several reports have been written and published suggesting that crypto mining now utilizes more energy than most third-world or developing countries. In addition, big names like Elon Musk – the billionaire and South African entrepreneur behind companies like SpaceX and Tesla – have chimed in about crypto’s energy usage.</p>
<h2>Musk&#8217;s Attitude Towards Mining</h2>
<p>Not long ago, Musk made it clear he <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/elon-musk-permits-bitcoin-payments-for-tesla-vehicles/" data-wpel-link="internal">wanted Tesla customers to be able</a> to buy vehicles with bitcoin. This caused the price of the asset to shoot up, and everyone thought BTC was going to reach a new level of mainstream legitimacy.</p>
<p>However, it was not to be, as just a few weeks after that, Musk <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-has-taken-a-nasty-stumble-many-are-blaming-elon-musk/" data-wpel-link="internal">rescinded the decision</a>, claiming he was concerned about how much energy was being used to extract BTC from the blockchain and that he would only allow bitcoin-based purchases if miners were more transparent about their sources and used cleaner energy.</p>
