<p class="s7">Looking for the best crypto coins in 2023? Below, we&rsquo;ll introduce you to Ethereum (ETH), Cosmos (ATOM) and Collateral Network (COLT) and the reasons why experts believe that these three cryptocurrencies are set to explode in 2023. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s10">Collateral Network (COLT)</p>
<p class="s11">Collateral Network (COLT) has a rather different approach, as this blockchain-based platform appeals directly to everyday investors and individuals. </p>
<p class="s7">When in need of cash, many people sell their expensive belongings, such as luxury watches or fine art, to raise money. Collateral Network (COLT) is the first platform on the blockchain where borrowers can use these assets as collateral for loans instead of selling them. The Collateral Network (COLT) platform appraises the asset and mints an asset-backed NFT representing the physical asset. The holder of the asset, the borrower, unlocks cash, while numerous lenders can earn passive income by investing their capital in portions of these fractionalised NFTs.</p>
<p class="s7">Indeed, Collateral Network (COLT) is a nurturing environment for lenders, who provide liquidity to the ecosystem and are rewarded with fixed interest rate payments and the ability to trade their loan portfolios for additional income.</p>
<p class="s7">Collateral Network (COLT) is a new project with a huge potential to increase 35 times before it hits the exchanges. Priced at only $0.014, the Collateral Network (COLT) token has already increased by 40% and is estimated to reach as high as $0.35 in the near future, providing early investors with 3500% returns. </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s10">Ethereum (ETH)</p>
<p class="s11">The case for Ethereum (ETH) is quite simple &ndash; it has had an excellent price performance so far in 2023. Despite many new projects competing with it, Ethereum (ETH) remains the champion when it comes to the DeFi space. </p>
<p class="s7">Ethereum (ETH) has increased by nearly 60% year-to-date, which could make some people reluctant to buy, thinking it may be overpriced. However, it&rsquo;s worth noticing that Ethereum (ETH) still trades about 50% below its all-time high, so it has a high chance of exploding this year. </p>
<p class="s7">Ethereum (ETH) is a market leader and its continuous developments keep it at the forefront. The main challenges of the network are cost and speed. But one of its co-founders, Vitalik Buterin, stated that Ethereum (ETH) currently operates at only half of its potential, indicating that more upgrades down the road are to address these main issues. </p>
<p></p>
<p class="s10">Cosmos (ATOM)</p>
<p class="s11">Dubbed the &ldquo;internet of blockchains&rdquo;, Cosmos (ATOM) aims to solve a major issue that has always been plaguing the crypto world. Interoperability means that blockchains can communicate with each other, such as sending one asset to another &ndash; and this is the thesis put forth by Cosmos (ATOM). </p>
<p class="s7">If Cosmos (ATOM) manages to solve the interoperability issue, the year 2023 could prove crucial for the company. Although competition is fierce in the crypto industry, Cosmos (ATOM) is specially built on the idea of scalability &ndash; such as allowing developers to create new blockchains and plug them into the &ldquo;Cosmoverse&rdquo; to communicate with other blockchains. </p>
<p class="s7">Still relatively a small project, many investors probably have not heard of Cosmos (ATOM) just yet. However, if it manages to expand, Cosmos (ATOM) could explode in 2023. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s10">Summary</p>
<p class="s11">If you are looking for new crypto projects to add to your portfolio, Ethereum (ETH), Cosmos (ATOM) and Collateral Network (COLT) are well worth your attention. With high potential and sturdy underpinning concepts, these three projects have the potential to be market leaders this year. </p>
