					<description><![CDATA[Ethereum price extended its decline below $1,880 against the US Dollar. ETH is showing bearish signs and might decline further toward $1,800. Ethereum is currently attempting a recovery wave from the $1,825 zone. The price is trading below $1,880 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,905 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could attempt a fresh increase but upsides might be capped near $1,900. Ethereum Price Faces Resistance Ethereum’s price failed to continue higher above the $1,925 resistance and started a fresh decline. ETH declined below the $1,900 and $1,880 levels to move into a short-term bearish zone, similar to Bitcoin. The price even tested the $1,825 support. A low is formed near $1,825 and the price is now attempting a recovery wave. There was a break above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,956 swing high to the $1,825 low. Ether price is still trading below $1,880 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,905 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Immediate resistance is near the $1,880 level or the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The first major resistance is near the $1,890 zone. The next major resistance is near the $1,900 level and the trend line. It is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,956 swing high to the $1,825 low. Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com A clear move above the $1,905 resistance could start a decent increase toward $1,955. The next major resistance is near the $1,975 level. Any more gains could send Ether toward the $2,050 resistance. More Losses in ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,890 resistance or $1,900, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,840 level. The first major support is near the $1,825 level, below which there is a risk of a larger decline.

					<description><![CDATA[Solana (SOL) has witnessed a remarkable recovery in the past week, showcasing a string of steady gains. Presently, SOL has increased by 10% and is actively traded at $21.80, reflecting a slight uptick in the crypto&#8217;s price. While it&#8217;s important to note that SOL remains significantly distant from its all-time high of $260, the recent upward motion has lifted its value beyond the $20 mark, indicating promising signs of an extended bullish sentiment What&#8217;s Behind SOL Rise?  There are several factors right now that could have influenced the rise in SOL’s price. These include macroeconomic factors such as inflation and crypto regulation in different areas. In addition, Solana has experienced some success in adoption with some ecosystems adopting the token and launching cross-chain bridges.  Related Reading: XRP Next Step: Here’s Why An Upward Move Could Be Likely However, the most likely factor is the increase in DEX volume recorded this week. Blockchain analysis platform DefiLlama revealed in a report earlier in the week that Solana had experienced a spike in DEX volume. According to the report, SOL’s DEX volume surged by over 80% and is ranked fifth within the crypto market. This development is likely to have boosted its price action in the past week.  Nonetheless, the Total Value Locked (TVL) has not reacted to this uptrend and has been stagnant since its decline last November following the FTX collapse. Currently, the TVL sits at around $275 million with no noticeable increase in value despite the gains of SOL in recent days.  Solana (SOL) Price Outlook And Prediction  SOL is currently trending upward and has continued its positive price action towards the weekend. However, the intermittent red candles on its weekly chart show that the bears are active this week.  Looking at the technical indicators, its relative strength index is at 50 in the neutral zone between the oversold region of 35 and the overbought region of 75. The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is currently in the buy zone which is a bullish signal. In addition, the histogram bars are green and signal that a bullish trend is ahead and if the bulls persist, SOL is likely to have a sustained uptrend in the coming days.  SOL is trading at $21.83 after it found critical support at the $15.43 price level weeks ago. This puts the altcoin close to the $22.50 resistance level. Related Reading: PEPE Bulls Losing Steam? Fatigue Appears To Undermine Price Rally A break above the $22.50 resistance level will help to boost its price to reclaim the $25 psychological resistance level. If this happens, SOL will likely rally to the $23.00 resistance level after breaking above $22. However, a price decline below $20 in the short term remains possible due to external market conditions that are bearish.  (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice.

					<description><![CDATA[BONE, the governance token of Shiba Inu, has experienced a significant uptick in the past week with its price surging by double digits during this period.

					<description><![CDATA[In the past week, Stellar (XLM) experienced a decline in price, moving from $0.1 to $0.096. This represents a decrease of -13.42% in value. Furthermore, in the past 24 hours, XLM recorded a minor drop of -0.61%. These price movements indicate a slight bearish sentiment prevailing in the crypto market, with XLM being influenced by the broader market conditions. The recent downtrend in XLM&#8217;s price suggests that bears currently have the upper hand, while the scope for bullish activity appears limited. What Could Be Responsible For The Recent Price Dip? The Stellar ecosystem has been rife with developments in recent months, with the biggest being the launch of the Spacewalk bridge that connects the blockchain to Polkadot. The bridge was meant to enable smooth transfer of the USDC stablecoin between the two blockchains fostering increased utility and potential demand within Stellar&#8217;s ecosystem.  However, this has not gone to plan, as Stellar&#8217;s price has failed to match the positive advancements in its ecosystem. Instead, bearish sentiment has engulfed XLM, which has contributed to the recent downward price movement. Related Reading: XRP Next Step: Here’s Why An Upward Move Could Be Likely The bearish sentiment indicates that market participants are cautious about XLM, leading to selling pressure and a lack of significant buying interest. It is important to consider the impact of market sentiment on short-term price fluctuations, as it can create challenges for price recovery and limit the potential for bullish momentum in the near term. What&#8217;s Next For Stellar (XLM)? Although XLM is currently experiencing a bearish sentiment, the long-term prospects for the cryptocurrency remain positive. Stellar&#8217;s roadmap for 2023 focuses on enhancing network utility through strategic initiatives. This includes making innovation easy and scalable through Soroban development, scaling and decentralization endeavors, and improving developer wallet tools. Stellar aims to win over builders by accelerating the growth of widely-used assets, promoting accessibility and user-friendly apps, and leveraging smart contracts for sustainable use cases in the DeFi ecosystem.

These initiatives are designed to strengthen Stellar&#8217;s position in the market and drive future growth. While short-term price movements may be influenced by market sentiment, the long-term success of Stellar relies on the execution of its strategic initiatives and the adoption of its network utility. As a result, XLM&#8217;s value could potentially increase in the future, with projections indicating the possibility of reaching $0.11 by 2024. Investors and traders should closely monitor the progress of Stellar&#8217;s roadmap and evaluate market conditions when considering the future prospects of XLM. At press time, XLM was trading at $0.09691 per coin with a 1-hour price increase of 1.1%. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice. Investing involves risk.

Regulatory uncertainties surrounding Ripple Labs, the company behind XRP, have played a significant role in dampening investor sentiment.  The ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the classification of XRP as a security has raised concerns about the asset&#8217;s long-term viability.

					<description><![CDATA[Circle, the official issuer of USDC, the second largest stablecoin by circulating supply, has frozen $63 million from the Multichain hack. Compiled Etherscan data on July 7 shows that the stablecoin issuer froze $27.65 million, $30.1 million, and $5.5 million in three transactions, hampering the hacker&#8217;s cash-out efforts. Multichain Hacked, Circle Intervenes Multichain, a cross-chain protocol router, was hacked on July 7, resulting in the loss of over $126 million worth of various tokens. The exploit came after the attacker illegally accessed Multichain&#8217;s Multi-Party Computation (MPC) address, which stores funds locked between blockchains. Subsequently, the hacker withdrew funds from the address and moved them to an externally controlled wallet. The Fantom Bridge was adversely affected by this outflow as the hacker withdrew various tokens, including wBTC, USDC, and USDT. There were a handful of other altcoins that the hacker stole.  Related Reading: Arbitrum DAO Locks $770 Million In ARB Tokens Into Vesting Contract: Implications For ARB Funds were also stripped from the Moonriver Bridge, with observers noting that at least $6.8 million worth of various coins, including USDC, were moved to an external address. It is also reported that an address associated with Multichain connecting with Dogecoin also lost over $600,000. The stolen USDC has now been frozen and cannot be moved, a relief for the community. However, it is not clear whether Circle will reverse funds to Multichain. In the past, Tether Holdings and Circle, the centralized issuers of the world&#8217;s most liquid stablecoins, have intervened to prevent bad actors from cashing out. Hack Compounding Multichain&#8217;s Woes, Bitcoin Firm Peckshield, a blockchain security firm, was the first to pick out the unusual transfers of over $118 million worth of assets from Multichain&#8217;s Fantom and Moonriver bridges. The firm went on to tag the team behind the cross-chain protocol, who immediately acted. In response to the hack, Multichain said the outflow was &#8220;abnormal&#8221; and halted all activity while recommending users pause their protocol and revoke all contracts approval.  Related Reading: Hackers Have Stolen $30 Billion In Crypto Since 2012, SlowMist Report Finds Although the Multichain team had assured the community that the private keys controlling asset movements through the bridge are secure and stored on-chain, their technology appears to have flaws, resulting in the hack.

					<description><![CDATA[Polygon Labs, the company behind the Polygon blockchain, has announced management changes as it undergoes a rebrand to the next chapter of its corporate development, known as &#8220;Polygon 2.0.&#8221;  The company has promoted its chief legal officer, Marc Boiron, to the position of CEO, while President Ryan Wyatt will step down at the end of July and serve in an advisory role. Major Leadership Shake-Up According to a press release shared with CoinDesk, Boiron&#8217;s appointment signals the company&#8217;s commitment to nurture and expand the global Polygon community of developers, builders, and users. Boiron, who has been with the firm since 2020, has extensive experience in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space, having worked in various legal and regulatory roles. Related Reading: Hackers Have Stolen $30 Billion In Crypto Since 2012, SlowMist Report Finds Furthermore, Rebecca Rettig, who joined the company in February as chief policy officer, will assume Boiron&#8217;s former role as chief legal officer. Co-founder Sandeep Nailwal will serve as executive chairman, overseeing the company&#8217;s strategic direction and partnerships. In a tweet announcing his departure, CEO Ryan Wyatt stated:  It&#8217;s bittersweet to share that I am leaving Polygon Labs at the end of the month! Marc Boiron, our Chief Legal Officer, will be stepping up &#38; leading working closely with Sandeep Nailwal! For me, I&#8217;ll be advising Polygon, investing, &#38; staying in the industry! More to come later. Polygon runs two of the most closely watched networks for scaling Ethereum transactions, and its rebrand to &#8220;Polygon 2.0&#8221; signals a new phase of growth and development for the company.  The management changes are part of a broader restructuring effort at the blockchain firm, aimed at positioning the company for long-term success in the rapidly evolving blockchain and cryptocurrency space. The expected focus of the rebrand to &#8220;Polygon 2.0&#8221; is to expand the company&#8217;s user base and developer community and enhance the platform&#8217;s features and capabilities. This will involve a renewed focus on community-building and innovation as the company seeks to position itself for long-term success. The rebrand is expected to signal a new phase of growth and development for Polygon as it continues to run two of the most closely watched networks for scaling Ethereum transactions.  Polygon 2.0 Architecture Revealed On the 29th of June, the firm already gave a hint of what to expect from Polygon 2.0. According to Polygon&#8217;s blog post, this new chapter aims to provide “unlimited” scalability and unified liquidity.  The proposed architecture consists of four protocol layers, each designed to operate together and enable an important process within the network. These layers include the Staking Layer, the Interop Layer, the Execution Layer, and the Proving Layer.  The Staking Layer is a Proof of Stake (PoS)-based protocol that leverages Polygon&#8217;s native token (MATIC) to provide decentralization to participating Polygon chains.  Related Reading: Arbitrum DAO Locks $770 Million In ARB Tokens Into Vesting Contract: Implications For ARB On the other hand, the Interop Layer facilitates secure and seamless cross-chain messaging within the Polygon ecosystem. At the same time, the Execution Layer enables any Polygon chain to produce sequenced batches of transactions.  With these developments, Polygon 2.0 is expected to offer a more robust and versatile platform that can support a wider range of use cases and applications while providing a more seamless and user-friendly experience for developers and users alike.  Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Matrixport, a crypto financial services platform, has always been bullish on Bitcoin, especially in 2023. So its latest prediction for the digital asset comes as no surprise to investors. This time around, Matrixport analysts have predicted that the price of BTC will push forward to as high as $125,000 by the end of 2024. A 310% Increase For Bitcoin? The current forecast by Matrixport analysts for Bitcoin will see the cryptocurrency rally as high as 310% if it does come to pass. This prediction, however, was not just thrown around without expected catalysts that would trigger such a rally, which is outlined in the report. Related Reading: Rapid Rise In Cardano’s TVL Points Toward Bullish Sentiment Around ADA For BTC to reach as high as $125,000 by the end of 2024, Matrixport expects that the potential approval of the Bitcoin Spot ETFs filed by investing giants such as BlackRock and Fidelity Investments, among others, could be the push it needs. 2024 is important for these Bitcoin Spot ETF filings because the final date for a decision from the United States Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) is in 2024. This is because the SEC gets three opportunities to postpone its decision, which it likely will. So a decision on whether or not investors will be able to trade a Spot BTC ETF is expected in February 2024 at the latest, as outlined in this Bitcoinist report. “With the potential approval of the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF and other institutional providers, the demand for Bitcoin could continue to support prices into our $45,000 year-end target,” Matrixport says in the report. “There is no obvious indication of what will drive the next bull market, but the data indicates that Bitcoin could continue to rally into the 2024 halving.” BTC Multiple Bullish Catalysts For BTC In 2024 As Matrixport mentions in its report, the Bitcoin Spot ETF filings are not the only bullish events that could drive a bull market in 2024. Another important event is the BTC halving event which is less than a year away now. This event will see the block rewards for the blockchain cut down in half from 6.25 BTC per mined block to 3.125 BTC per mined block. Next BTC halving is less than a year away &#124; Source: Binance This decrease in the rate at which new BTC is being brought into circulation, coupled with the fact that the digital asset possesses a very limited supply, has always triggered each bull market. So even if expectations for the Spot ETFs do not play out and the SEC does reject the filings, it will likely only be a short-lived bearish momentum as the halving will take place only a few months after. Related Reading: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Says Bitcoin Is Digital Gold, So What’s The Digital Silver? Going by historical performance, the BTC price has been known to rise more than 100% as expectations around the halving event grow. Given this, it is possible that BTC does reach a price of $125,000 by the end of 2024, according to the Matrixport report.

<h2 class="p2">Multiple Bullish Catalysts For BTC In 2024</h2>
<p class="p2">As Matrixport mentions in its report, the Bitcoin Spot ETF filings are not the only bullish events that could drive a bull market in 2024. Another important event is the BTC halving event which is less than a year away now. This event will see the block rewards for the blockchain cut down in half from 6.25 BTC per mined block to 3.125 BTC per mined block.</p>

<p class="p2">This decrease in the rate at which new BTC is being brought into circulation, coupled with the fact that the digital asset possesses a very limited supply, has always triggered each bull market. So even if expectations for the Spot ETFs do not play out and the SEC does reject the filings, it will likely only be a short-lived bearish momentum as the halving will take place only a few months after.</p>

<p class="p2">Going by historical performance, the BTC price has been known to rise more than 100% as expectations around the halving event grow. Given this, it is possible that BTC does reach a price of $125,000 by the end of 2024, according to the Matrixport report.</p>
