<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) moderated early in the Asian session as the pair continues to orbit the 26587.57 area, an upside price objective above which Stops were recently executed and that is associated with buying pressure that emerged around the 24750 and 25143.24 areas.&nbsp; &nbsp;Traders recently pushed BTC/USD up to the 26783.20 area after Stops were elected above the 26611.97 area, representing the 50% retracement of the recent depreciating range from 28473.93 to 24750.&nbsp; Additional upside retracement levels in this depreciating range include the 27051, 27595, and 27677 areas.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The technical significance of these levels was confirmed when buying pressure emerged around the 26165 area during a pullback, just above another upside price objective around the 26153 area.&nbsp; Below the market, downside price objectives include the 25323.24 and 24680.87 levels.&nbsp; Stops are also cited below major retracement levels linked to the 19568.52 and 15460 levels, including the 25094, 23954, 23255, 22278, and 22025 areas.</p>
