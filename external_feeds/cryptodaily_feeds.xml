			  <description><![CDATA[<p>A hack that exploited and drained GMX tokens from a whale enabled the perpetrator to exchange the assets for 2,627 Ether.</p>
<p>The hacks go on and on. It seems that exploits are being found in the code of DeFi protocols left, right and centre, and it must be wondered just when will the space reach the maturity and breadth of security whereby the hacks stop happening.</p>
GMX whale hack
<p>Hackers have stolen $3.4 million worth of GMX tokens from a whale, according to security firms CertiK and PeckShield.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hack saw the perpetrators take control of 82,519 GMX tokens and exchange them for 2,627 Ether. The assets were then transferred to the Ethereum network via the Hop Protocol and Across Protocol.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hack led to a sudden drop in the value of the GMX token to $38, but it has since recovered to $41.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An administrator in the GMX Telegram group confirmed that a phishing attack had taken place, clarifying that there were no security vulnerabilities on the GMX platform itself. A moderator in the group stated that they were in communication with the victim of the attack.</p>
Holiday period hacks
<p>On January 1, Luke Dashjr, a Bitcoin core developer, announced that he had fallen victim to hackers and lost BTC as a result. This news sparked discussions within the cryptocurrency community about the dangers of self-custodying digital assets. Some community members argued that if even a top developer like Dashjr couldn't secure his BTC, it would be difficult for the average person to do so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DeFi hackers have been active over the holiday season, with $12m worth of digital assets taken in a flash loan attack on Dec. 25 and $8m drained from Bitkeep wallets in another hack on Dec. 26.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Uniswap's newly implemented bug bounty program has been a roaring success, as it helped uncover and subsequently resolve an existing vulnerability in its Universal Router smart contract.</p>
<p>The two new smart contracts, Permit2 and Universal Router, were released back in November 2022. Through token approval sharing and management, the Permit2 smart contract grants applications with access to an array of secure authorization capabilities. On the other hand, Universal Router compile ERC-20 and NFT transactions into a single swap router, giving Uniswap a more efficient method for exchanging between various types of cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>With the introduction of these new smart contracts, Uniswap also announced a bug bounty program which would help the platform detect any potential vulnerabilities. As the digital currency and blockchain market continues to evolve, bug bounties have become a way for firms to ensure their software, systems, and critical infrastructure are secure.</p>
<p>DeFi security auditing firm Dedaub was among the first to receive a hefty award for their work on identifying a vulnerability on the Universal Router smart contract. The vulnerability was flagged as having the ability to permit reentrancy during a transaction's confirmation time, which could be exploited by threat actors to then drain a wallet's funds.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The Dedaub team has disclosed a Critical vulnerability to the Uniswap team!Funds are safe - Uniswap addressed the issue and redeployed the Universal Router smart contracts on all its chains 👏The vulnerability allows re-entertrancy to drain the user's funds, mid-tx.🧵 pic.twitter.com/wFSFsohPvy</p>
&mdash; Dedaub (@dedaub) January 2, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p>Dedaub explains that the Universal Router provides users with the opportunity to make numerous transactions at once, such as exchanging multiple tokens and NFTs in a single go. The router's integrated scripting language is capable of a vast array of token activities including transfers to external payees. When done correctly step by step, these funds would be delivered right away should the transaction meet the criteria set by the smart contract's parameters.</p>
<p>By design, this means that a third-part code, when invoked during the transfer, could allow the code to re-enter the Universal Router and manage or pull tokens that are on the smart contract for a temporary period. This prompted the Dedaub whitehats to advise Uniswap of a resolution, which involved patching the smart contract with a reentrancy lock for the core execution module of Universal Router.</p>
<p>Uniswap then swiftly awarded $40,000 to the Dedaub team for their prompt disclosure. According to Uniswap, the issue was of medium-level severity, while further assessment of the vulnerability pointed to a low-chance, high-impact scenario. Dedaub confirms that the attack vector can be considered as user-end error, because the scenario would only happen if a user directly sends NFTs to an untrusted recipient.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>With the crypto winter showing no signs of abating, crypto payment companies Wyre and EmpireDAO have become its latest casualties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wyre informed employees about its plans during the holiday season, while EmpireDAO will look to make a &ldquo;clean exodus&rdquo; from its Manhattan location.&nbsp;</p>
Wyre To Shut Operations?
<p>As the ongoing crypto winter continues, crypto and Web3 businesses are feeling the pinch. The latest to be impacted are crypto payments firm Wyre, and EmpireDAO, a crypto co-working space that was dubbed as the WeWork of Web3. Founded nearly a decade ago, Wyre recently let go of several employees, with two former employees confirming plans that the company intended to shutter its operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to one former employee who cited an email from the CEO of Wyre, Ioannis Giannaros, the company was planning on liquidating and would terminate services as early as the ongoing month. Employees also revealed that no severance package had been offered to them by the company. However, Giannaros stated that the company was still operating but would be scaling back to plan the way forward.&nbsp;</p>
EmpireDAO Planning A Clean Exodus&nbsp;
<p>More evidence of the market&rsquo;s downturn was presented in the form of EmpireDAO announcing the end of its tenancy at 190 Bowery in New York. The crypto co-working space was founded by Mike Fraietta, with its office building tapped to become the WeWork of Web3. However, the company is already looking to move, under a year after its opening. The space at 190 Bowery has amassed 1500 members, with 300 daily visitors. The firm is now looking to move elsewhere, with Fraietta stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We tried every which way to get new sponsors, partnerships, and even crowdfunding. But we needed more help to sustain at 190 Bowery.&rdquo;</p>

Last Ditch Effort&nbsp;
<p>To save its tenancy, Fraietta even attempted a last-minute crowdfunding campaign, aiming to raise around 215 ETH ($260,000.) However, this effort fell short, as the campaign received a lukewarm response. In the end, the effort was able to galvanize a total of 6.27 ETH, which is around $8100. The donations will be returned to the donors with the campaign failing to achieve its target.&nbsp;</p>
The Future For EmpireDAO&nbsp;
<p>With EmpireDAO closing its current location, Fraietta stated that there are plans to reopen at another location for &ldquo;Season 2.&rdquo; He also highlighted plans for potential EmpireDAO pop-ups at various crypto conferences and at this year&rsquo;s SXSW in Austin, Texas. The announcement of EmpireDAO&rsquo;s closure received several supportive messages from users on the group&rsquo;s Telegram chat. One user wrote,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you for opening the doors both literally and figuratively to so many people, projects, minds, and movements.&rdquo;</p>

Other Companies Feeling The Pinch&nbsp;
<p>The news about Wyre and EmpireDAO comes against the backdrop of an unrelenting crypto winter that has impacted several other startups and seen capital dry up. The underlying blockchain for many projects that worked on EmpireDAO, Solana, has also taken a significant hit, with its native SOL cryptocurrency down nearly 90%. Another recent casualty of the ongoing bear market is crypto investment firm Midas, which announced that it is shutting down its DeFi platform after suffering cataclysmic losses during the Terra, Celsius, and FTX crashes.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Web3 research tool and NFT community platform NFT Inspect has announced that it will be shutting down on January 17, a move that coincides with the global decline in NFT trades.</p>
<p>According to a tweet from the project's team, the shutdown includes both their website and the web browser extension. NFT Inspect's toolset allowed NFT traders and enthusiasts to properly gauge and assess NFT values, in terms of how it is performing within the NFT market in general, as well as, specifically, in terms of their popularity on Crypto Twitter. This was done by tracking changes in NFT Twitter profile photos and extracting analytics based on these changes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After months of working and reworking, we&rsquo;ve come to the difficult conclusion that we cannot maintain Inspect going forward [...] we want to sincerely thank each and every one of you for your support over the rollercoaster of this last year," the NFT Inspect team stated.</p>

<p>Following a drastic market downturn in Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), the decision to end this project has been finalized. According to a recent report, NFT trading globally experienced an alarming 77% dip between Q2 and Q3 of 2022, resulting in total global volume of only $1.7 billion during that quarter.</p>
<p>What's more concerning is that there was also an 84% decrease in profits from reselling these tokens during the same period &mdash; clearly demonstrating how quickly investor sentiment can change within this sector.</p>
<p>Data aggregated from CryptoSlam.io reveals how roughly $650 million worth of NFTs were sold in December 2022, a considerable decrease as compared to the whopping $2.6 billion figure observed in December 2021.</p>
<p>It is still unclear as to how this crypto space will evolve in the near future, however certain experts are exploring new avenues and possibilities for NFTs. As of now, however, it looks like crypto investors may have to look elsewhere for hopes of a more lucrative sector to carve on.</p>
<p>The crypto industry is taking notice of the declining trade dynamics in NFTs, and projects like NFT Inspect have been forced to make tough decisions that best suit their particular business model. Nevertheless, the crypto industry has a lot more to offer beyond NFTs with emerging use cases in other areas such as DeFi continuing to show promise for investors.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Tests 16880 Resistance:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 5 January 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) gave back some recent gains early in the Asian session as the pair retreated to the 16799.44 area after trading as high as the 16916.87 level, representing a test of the 61.8% retracement of the appreciating range from 15992.64 to 18385.36.&nbsp; &nbsp;The ongoing move higher also represented a test of the 23.6% retracement of the broad depreciating range from 21478.80 to 15460.&nbsp; Traders recently drove BTC/USD as low as the 16326.16 area after Stops were elected below the 16375.18 area, a downside retracement level related to selling pressure around the 18385.36 and 17525 levels.&nbsp; Additional related downside price objectives related to these areas of selling pressure include the 15900, 15313, and 14364 levels.&nbsp; If BTC/USD reclaims some upside momentum, additional technically significant upside retracement levels include the 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTC/USD depreciated approximately 64% in 2022, and it was off more than 3% in December.&nbsp; Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, the 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Below these areas, technically significant levels include the 14613, 14500.15, 13369, 10432.73, 10727, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;below the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;100-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 16715.49 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 16726.21.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;14500.15/ 13369.11/ 10727.75 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Core Scientific has come to an agreement with Celsius Network to shut down the 37,000 mining rigs that it was hosting for the latter.&nbsp;</p>
Power Cut To Celsius&rsquo;s Rigs
<p>The Celsius Network has agreed to let the Bitcoin miner Core Scientific cut power to the 37,000 mining rigs it was hosting for the defunct crypto platform due to Celsius&rsquo;s ongoing bankruptcy proceedings. The mining company initiated this move by filing a revised proposed order on January 3, claiming that all Celsius mining rigs would be powered down immediately. The filing also stated that the powered-down rigs would not be restarted during the transition period.&nbsp;</p>
Celsius Defaulted On Electricity Fees
<p>This move comes after several months of Celsius defaulting on power bills, for which Core Scientific even accused Celsius on October 21. In fact, the lack of payment had even created liquidity issues for the Bitcoin miner, for which it had to declare bankruptcy on December 21.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, Core Scientific filed a motion on December 28 to reject the contract since Celsius had been in breach of contract due to non-payment of bills. The court filings have revealed that Core Scientific has covered around $7.8 million of power fees for Celsius till December 28 and claimed that it could not afford to continue shouldering the burden of Celsius&rsquo;s unpaid power costs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By terminating the Celsius contract, Core Scientific would be able to generate a revenue of $2 million per month by renting out the space currently occupied by the Celsius mining rigs.&nbsp;</p>
BTC Mining Not Profitable Anymore
<p>Bitcoin mining is not a profitable expedition anymore. Costs of production have increased while Bitcoin prices have dropped. The Russia-Ukraine war has been a major factor leading to the rising costs of electricity, something that Bitcoin mining rigs need lots of. On top of that, the plummeting value of Bitcoin has also eaten into miners&rsquo; profits. In fact, Bitcoin&rsquo;s hash price, which is the revenue miners can earn per unit of hash rate, has dropped by 75% in 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, share prices have also dropped, with Core Scientific itself losing almost 99.15% in its share prices throughout 2022. On the other hand, bankrupt crypto firm Celsius has already been ordered by a judge to refund customers' crypto assets worth $44 million. It is to be seen if Celsius returns any of the fees that it owes to the mining company.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s7">With the crypto winter giving way to the few but sure signs of spring, Bitcoin is expected to lead the coming bull run. Optimistic analysts predict a price jump of 341% for the premier cryptocurrency by the end of 2023. While most analysts predict a 47% rise for the same period. However, Bitcoins pump will fall below those of Popsicle Finance (ICE) and ORBN, with analysts predicting a 6000% pump for ORBN during its presale. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s10">Bitcoin (BTC)</p>
<p class="s7">Bitcoin(BTC) is the first decentralized cryptocurrency. It is also the cryptocurrency with the largest market capitalization at $319.37B. During the bull run that spanned late 2020 and the first quarter of 2022, the price of Bitcoin rose to an all-time high of $68,990.90. </p>
<p class="s7">However, the second quarter of 2022 was the beginning of a crypto winter that has lasted until the year's end. Currently, Bitcoin's price is around $16,600, and Bitcoin has continued to trade around this level. </p>
<p class="s7">Nevertheless, it is not all doom and gloom for bitcoin investors. According to analysts, the only way for Bitcoin in the coming year is up. These forecasts signal the end of the winter and herald the coming of a much-anticipated bull run.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s10">Popsicle Finance (ICE)</p>
<p class="s7">Popsicle Finance(ICE) is a project that provides a platform for users to manage liquidity across various chains while ensuring they get the highest yields possible. Popsicle Finance believes that all chains should be interconnected.</p>
<p class="s7">The native token of Popsicle Finance is ICE, minted on the ERC-20 chain but connected to other chains like the BNB Chain. Governance rights are conferred through the possession of Popsicle Finance&rsquo;s ICE.</p>
<p class="s7">In the past 30 days, Popsicle Finance has experienced a 185% bull run. The predominant sentiment for this coin is bullish. Popsicle Finance is expected to hit around $0.50 by the end of 2022 and increase by an additional 228.02% to $1.54 by the end of 2024. As a result, analysts expect Popsicle Finance to be a top pick for 2023.</p>

<p class="s10">Orbeon Protocol</p>
<p class="s7">Orbeon Protocol is a decentralized investment platform that will allow promising businesses and startups to access funding and investment seamlessly. </p>
<p class="s7">Orbeon Protocol aims to revolutionize the venture capital and crowdfunding industry. Orbeon Protocol will issue fractionalized NFTs as a form of fundraising, and investors can purchase these equity-backed f-NFTs for as low as $1.</p>
<p class="s7">The native token of the Protocol is ORBN. It has a total supply of 888 million. Purchasing ORBN confers investors with governance rights, as well as being entitled to discounts on trading fees and cashback rewards. Holders can also lock their tokens to earn passive income. </p>
<p class="s7">The initial presale price of ORBN is $0.004 and is predicted by analysts to rise to $0.24 (around 6,000%) during the presale period. With the crypto space in slow recovery, there aren&rsquo;t many projects that can offer investors this sort of return.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Indian government is launching a cryptocurrency awareness campaign aimed at educating investors about the legalities of crypto in India while highlighting the risks associated with investing in digital assets. While the government entertains itself with awareness campaigns, a report was recently released that explained the enormous impact that India&rsquo;s 30% crypto tax has had on local exchanges. </p>
India&rsquo;s Crypto Awareness Campaign
<p>The government of India is reportedly launching an initiative aimed at raising awareness of cryptocurrencies whilst educating investors about the legal status of crypto in India. The awareness campaign will also highlight the risks of investing in crypto assets. The first-of-its-kind campaign will be overseen by the Investor Protection and Education Fund Authority &ndash; a government body controlled by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. According to a government official quoted by Bitcoin.com:</p>

<p>The campaign will highlight that cryptocurrencies are not legal in India and there are also deep risks involved in such assets. Any investment where the people are being promised lucrative and assured returns, there is an element of high risk.</p>

India&rsquo;s Stance on Cryptocurrencies
<p>India has been firm on its stance against cryptocurrencies and the Indian central Bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been advocating a complete ban on all crypto, warning of their potential to destabilise India's monetary and fiscal stability. Most recently, the Indian central bank governor Shaktikanta Das, said that cryptocurrencies should be banned, and if allowed to grow, might be the cause of the next financial crisis.</p>
<p>The government is preparing to regulate cryptocurrencies, but Das followed suit with the opinion of other central bankers and leaders of global financial bodies by saying that crypto had no underlying value and posed a risk for macroeconomic and financial stability. Das sternly commented:</p>

<p>Mark my words, next financial crisis will come from private cryptocurrencies&hellip;After FTX episode, don&rsquo;t think we need to say anything more on crypto.</p>

<p>The governor has urged that cryptocurrencies be banned:</p>

<p>It should be prohibited because if it is allowed to grow &hellip; say it&rsquo;s regulated and allowed to grow &hellip; please mark my words that the next financial crisis will come from private cryptocurrencies.</p>

India&rsquo;s Harsh Crypto Tax is Forcing Traders to Foreign Exchanges
<p>When the new Indian tax law came into effect on March 31, 2022, it obligated citizens trading in crypto to pay a capital gains tax of 30% on their crypto. As if that is not harsh enough, traders have also been required to pay a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) on every single transaction. According to TechCrunch, which cites a new report by Esya, these almost draconian tax rates have finally caught up to local cryptocurrency exchanges and have resulted in local exchanges &ldquo;ceding the lion&rsquo;s share of the market to those operated by foreign players.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Data from Delhi-based think tank Esya, report that Binance, Coinbase, and other foreign exchanges command 67.6% of the cryptocurrency market share in India as of October 2022 - up from 50% in November 2021. Esya&rsquo;s report says that during the period between February 2022, when the country&rsquo;s new tax policy was unveiled, and October 2022, a whopping $3.8 billion of trading volume shifted from domestic centralised exchanges to foreign-operated exchanges. Locally operated exchanges including WazirX, CoinSwitch, and CoinDCX lost 81% of their trading volume in the time between July and October 2022. The major loss by locally operated exchanges is attributed to the fact that traders argue that by moving their assets to foreign exchanges will mask their activities from local authorities. Many foreign exchanges such as KuCoin allow trading, within certain capital limits, without requiring KYC details.</p>
<p>Esya concludes its report by urging the Indian government to re-evaluate its crypto tax policy.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Federal Reserve, together with the FDIC, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, issued a joint statement warning banks of the risks of dealing with crypto.</p>
<p>The joint statement, published on Tuesday, gives a perceived litany of issues which could be associated with the crypto-asset sector according to the three US government organisations.</p>
<p>The first major risk in the statement is the possibility of fraud and scams. With the sector still largely unregulated, it can be difficult for individuals to protect themselves from unscrupulous actors looking to take advantage of unsuspecting investors.</p>
<p>Legal uncertainties are also a significant concern. Issues related to custody practices, redemptions, and ownership rights can all be murky and confusing, and some of these issues are currently the subject of legal proceedings.</p>
<p>In addition, some crypto-asset companies have been accused of making inaccurate or misleading representations and disclosures. This includes misrepresentations about federal deposit insurance and other practices that may be deceptive or abusive. These types of practices can cause significant harm to retail and institutional investors, customers, and counterparties.</p>
<p>The volatility of crypto-asset markets is another major risk. This volatility can have a range of impacts, including the potential for deposit flows associated with crypto-asset companies to be affected.</p>
<p>Stablecoins, which are designed to maintain a stable value, can also be a "run risk," which could lead to deposit outflows for banking organisations that hold stablecoin reserves.</p>
<p>The interconnected nature of the crypto-asset sector also presents risks, as contagion within the sector is possible through opaque lending, investing, funding, service, and operational arrangements. These interconnections could also create concentration risks for banking organisations with exposures to the crypto-asset sector.</p>
<p>The risk management and governance practices in the crypto-asset sector have been criticised for being immature and lacking robustness.</p>
<p>The use of open, public, and decentralised networks also carries its own set of risks, including the lack of governance mechanisms, unclear roles and responsibilities, and vulnerabilities to cyber attacks and outages.</p>
<p>In outlining all of these perceived risks, the 3 governmental bodies have sought to make all banks publicly aware of them. However, it does make it clear that banks are not prohibited from providing banking services &ldquo;of any specific class or type&rdquo;, as long as they fall within the law.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The setting up of a national cryptocurrency exchange in Indonesia could herald a breakthrough for adoption in this highly populated country.</p>
National exchange coming in 2023
<p>Indonesia is set to launch a cryptocurrency exchange in 2023 as part of a financial reform plan, according to a report on Bloomberg. The platform will be established prior to a shift in regulatory oversight from the Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency of Indonesia (Bappebti) to the Financial Services Authority (FSA).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The move follows the ratification of the Financial Sector Development and Reinforcement bill (P2SK) by the House of Representatives of Indonesia on December 15th, which aims to become the primary legal reference in the financial service sector.</p>
<p>Bappebti head, Didid Noordiatmoko, announced on January 4th that the exchange should be set up this year, following a blanket ban on crypto payments in 2017. Despite the ban, trading in digital assets has retained a legal footing in Indonesia.&nbsp;</p>
A fall in crypto transactions
<p>Data from Noordiatmoko shows that the value of cryptocurrency transactions in Indonesia fell by half in 2022, from IDR 859.4tn ($55m) to IDR 296.66tn ($19m).</p>
<p>The establishment of a cryptocurrency exchange and the shift in regulatory oversight to the FSA is expected to provide greater clarity and regulation in the sector. It remains to be seen how the exchange will impact the use and adoption of cryptocurrencies in Indonesia.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Former CEO of the bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, has pleaded not guilty to charges brought against him by U.S. authorities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bankman-Fried was appearing before a judge in the U.S. District Court in New York City with lawyers Mark Cohen and Christian Everdell.&nbsp;</p>
Bankman-Fried Pleads Not Guilty&nbsp;
<p>Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and former CEO of bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX, has pleaded not guilty to all eight counts of criminal charges brought against him by U.S. authorities. The embattled former CEO appeared before a judge at the U.S. District Court in New York City, in tow with his lawyers. Bankman-Fried had founded Alameda Research in 2017 and went on to establish FTX in 2019.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bankman-Fried was expected to plead not guilty and could now be part of a lengthy legal battle, facing up to 115 years in prison if convicted.&nbsp;</p>
Trial To Commence In October 2023&nbsp;
<p>The court set the tentative trial date as 2nd October 2022, with prosecutors expected to present evidence related to the case to the court over the next four weeks. Additionally, Bankman-Fried is also not allowed to access any FTX or Alameda Research assets. The judge also agreed to a request to withhold the identities of two individuals, other than Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s parents, who helped secure bail for the former CEO. The request was approved following reports that his parents have been subject to threats and harassment. According to lawyers,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His parents have, in recent weeks, become the target of intense media scrutiny, harassment, and threats. Among other things, Mr. Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s parents have received a steady stream of threatening correspondence, including communications expressing a desire that they suffer physical harm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>SBF was released on a bond of $250 million, which is the largest-ever pretrial bond. Under the bail conditions, Bankman-Fried will also have to wear an &ldquo;electronic monitoring bracelet,&rdquo; attend mental health counseling, and remain under house arrest at his parents&rsquo; house in California.&nbsp;</p>
Gary Wang, Caroline Ellison Plead Guilty&nbsp;
<p>Back in December, FTX co-founder and former CTO Gary Wang and Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison pleaded guilty to criminal charges connected with the collapse of FTX. Both are also facing penalties from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the CTFC, along with criminal charges brought by prosecutors. Both executives have stated they intend to cooperate with the authorities and will play a critical role as witnesses, given their close equation with Bankman-Fried, FTX, and Alameda Research.&nbsp;</p>
A Risky Move&nbsp;
<p>To many observers, Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s plea is a risky move in stark contrast to that of his colleagues, Wang and Ellison, who both plead guilty. Many view his actions as cocky, given that he went on a full media tour before his arrest, appearing on several shows and Twitter spaces talks. Bankman-Fried was finally arrested in the Bahamas and then extradited to the United States in December.&nbsp;</p>
The FTX Fiasco&nbsp;
<p>The chaos at FTX saw Bankman-Fried step down as CEO, replaced by Enron veteran John Ray III. During the U.S. House Financial Services Committee, Ray was the only witness, with Bankman-Fried unable to join after his arrest. The hearing saw Ray reveal the extent to which customer funds were misused and the lack of internal controls and risk management systems. He also disclosed that there was no board overseeing operations at FTX, and neither did the exchange have an accounting or Human Resources department.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>333 limited edition art NFTs, each paired with a high quality, GIA-certified Cape diamond, will go on private sale January 11, followed by a public sale on January 18.</p>
<p>A first of its kind, Diamond Dawn is an NFT project created by Mike Moldawsky, with the collaboration of Moldawsky Diamonds, renowned artist David Ariew, and Tony Herrera, an experienced entrepreneur and innovator in the web 3.0 space.</p>
<p>The project uses blockchain and NFT technology to promote the transparent and ethical sourcing of diamonds.</p>
<p>It is the brain-child of entrepreneur Mike Moldawsky, of the well-known Moldawsky family, steeped in the history of the diamond industry.</p>
<p>David Ariew is one of the most prominent NFT artists in the world, recently selling an NFT artwork at Sotheby's for $224,000. He designed 2 of the 3 Beeple X Madonna NFTs, and has collaborated with top artists who include Katy Perry, Zedd, and Deadmau5.</p>
<p>Tony Herrera is a visionary with a long track record of building and innovating in the fields of cryptocurrency, blockchain, and NFTs. He is a founding member of Galaxis, and of several DAOs dedicated to the metaverse, including MeebitsDAO, NeonDAO, and ReadyPlayerDAO.</p>
The Diamond Dawn NFT project
<p>Diamond Dawn is a project that matures over a 6-month period. The four phases of the project are similar to those of the natural diamond processing that takes place in the real world.</p>
<p>All of these steps are performed through an interactive interface designed by Asaf Snir, an expert with 15 years in website design specialising in unique visual experiences and parallax technologies.</p>
<p>In the first phase, the collector will mine a digital Rough Stone in Diamond Dawn&rsquo;s virtual mine. Two further phases enable the collector to evolve their diamond until it reaches the perfection of the digital diamond designed by David Ariew.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Box opening - a luxury design by Moldawsky that weighs 8kg and measures 25*25*25 cm</p>
<p>The fourth and final phase is when the collector has to make the choice of whether to keep the virtual digital diamond, or whether to have it transformed into its physical diamond form.</p>
<p>If they choose the physical diamond, they will receive a limited-edition art piece in the form of a GIA-certified diamond created by Moldawsky. The physical diamond will have exactly the same attributes of colour, shape, and carat weight of the NFT diamond.</p>
<p>One very important aspect of the project is that the NFT that backs the physical diamond is then destroyed by being burned. This will then give greater scarcity value to the remaining NFTs, potentially having the effect that they become more valuable than the physical diamonds themselves.</p>
<p>The diamonds are stored at the Moldawsky Diamonds vault, inside of the Israel Diamond Exchange, which is the largest diamond exchange in the world.</p>
Aims of the project
<p>Primarily, the Diamond Dawn project looks to demonstrate the power and ability of decentralised NFT technology to solve the very real problem of certification fraud and manipulation in the $100 billion diamond industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, the fact that blockchain and NFT technology is able to certify and verify a diamond&rsquo;s provenance, will enable the tracking of diamonds mined in conflict areas, known as blood diamonds. This in turn should lead to the transparency and ethical sourcing of diamonds that the industry sorely needs.</p>
<p>Secondly, the project seeks to find the value balance between the physical real-world asset, and the virtual-world twin in the form of its paired NFT.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The market, in the form of the Diamond Dawn collectors, will decide whether to own the physical diamond, or its digital representation. How many of the 333 NFTs will need to be burned before the value of the NFT becomes akin to that of the physical diamond? Which one will end up being worth more?</p>
Further information
<p>The Diamond Dawn project is only available through a submission process on the official website. If accepted as a collector, an individual is then given two invitations which they can share with other potential collectors. This keeps the process fair, and allows the public to form the&nbsp; collector community rather than the project team itself. There is a limit of two NFTs per collector.</p>
<p>Those wishing to find out more about Diamond Dawn can also watch a short introductory video of the project on the Diamond Dawn Twitter account.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Russian Federation has submitted a draft bill regarding the digital ruble to the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament. </p>
<p>&nbsp;Russian lawmakers, led by the Chairman of the Financial Market Committee Anatoly Aksakov, have presented draft legislation on the central bank digital currency (CBDC) minted by Russia&rsquo;s monetary authority &ndash; the digital ruble. The main purpose of the bill is to develop a necessary payment infrastructure for the CBDC and will allow Russian citizens, businesses, and the state access to fast, convenient, and low-cost money transfers according to reports.</p>
<p>Under the proposal, the Bank of Russia will be the sole entity responsible for managing the CBDC system and it will also lay out the steps necessary to create a digital ruble wallet and gain access to the network. The document submitted to Parliament codifies the digital ruble as the official currency of the Russian Federation and deems CBDCs issued by the central banks of foreign countries as non-domestic.</p>
<p>The digital ruble will be introduced as a third legal tender option for payments and purchases in Russia, along with traditional cash and other forms of money. Deputy Minister of Finance, Alexei Moiseev, said that the digital currency will be ready to implement in April 2023. The CBDC will enable the nation to increase the government&rsquo;s control over the targeted expenditure of money from its budget, make targeted payments and optimize the process of recovering monies not spent. Reports also indicate that blockchain technology is being used to build the digital ruble which will make it possible to identify certain types of money and track their movements according to distinct digital codes, which are analogous to serial numbers that are also found on paper money.</p>
Bank of Russia Testing Crypto for International Payments
<p>The Bank of Russia is reportedly planning to test the use of crypto for international payments within the regulatory framework. The Deputy Chairperson of the Central Bank said:</p>

<p>We currently plan to test using cryptocurrency for international payments, meaning for international economic activities, within the framework of the regulatory sandbox.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>If you are interested to know more about Miner US Limited you can check out the : Miner US Limited Introduction Video</p>
<p>Introducing Miner US Limited </p>
<p>Graves David Gavin, the man behind the cryptocurrency investment firm Miner US Limited, spent four years studying the market before launching the company in New York in April 2019. Our parent company, Miner US Limited, put on a great party for us to celebrate the launch. Miner US plans to provide an alternative to the usual risks and limitations associated with investing in cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance projects, crypto securities, and blockchain technology. Ethical cryptocurrency and blockchain investment is a top priority for this team of analysts, engineers, data scientists, operators, and risk managers. Managing resources wisely is a top priority for the organization.</p>
<p>Models for Cloud Mining</p>
<p>The responses to the question "How does cloud mining work?" highlight cloud crypto mining models. Cloud-based cryptocurrency miners can choose between two distinct models. Two models of cloud-based crypto mining are described here.</p>
<p>HashPowerLeasing</p>
<p>In this model, cloud miners lease a portion of a mining farm's hashing power. To participate in the mining farm's profits, miners must subscribe to a cloud mining company plan. Miners leasing hash power from the farm pay neither setup nor maintenance fees. The mining rewards of each miner are also determined by the hashing power of each miner.</p>
<p>Cloud mining benefits</p>
<p>Cloud mining's benefits must also be mentioned. Cloud-based cryptocurrency mining is efficient and maintenance-free. Cloud mining Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies offers numerous benefits.</p>
<p>Cost-effectiveness</p>
<p>Mining in the cloud is cost-effective because miners do not require equipment. Also, miners are not required to upgrade or maintain equipment. Miners need not be concerned with electricity costs, heat and noise from mining equipment.</p>
<p>Trouble-free</p>
<p>The biggest benefit of cloud mining is that it is maintenance-free. Mining service companies maintain miners' equipment. Typically, mining service providers avoid maintenance problems by situating mining farms in cooler climates and utilizing chilling towers.</p>
<p>Support</p>
<p>Consider the technological support provided by the mining service provider. Cloud-based cryptocurrency mining requires no cryptocurrency, mining hardware, or protocol expertise. Create an account with a mining service provider and pay the hashing power fees. All account rewards can be viewed on a tablet or smartphone.</p>
<p>Miner US Launch and Services</p>
<p>Miner US offers lifetime cloud mining for cryptocurrencies based on USDT. They provide multi-algorithm, multi-coin cloud mining by utilizing cutting-edge technology. Since its inception, the company's open hash power market has been a tremendous success. Mobile apps enable users to access our services from any location.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are interested to know more about Miner US Limited you can check out the : Miner US Limited Introduction Video</p>
<p>Introducing Miner US Limited </p>
<p>Graves David Gavin, the man behind the cryptocurrency investment firm Miner US Limited, spent four years studying the market before launching the company in New York in April 2019. Our parent company, Miner US Limited, put on a great party for us to celebrate the launch. Miner US plans to provide an alternative to the usual risks and limitations associated with investing in cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance projects, crypto securities, and blockchain technology. Ethical cryptocurrency and blockchain investment is a top priority for this team of analysts, engineers, data scientists, operators, and risk managers. Managing resources wisely is a top priority for the organization.</p>
<p>Models for Cloud Mining</p>
<p>The responses to the question "How does cloud mining work?" highlight cloud crypto mining models. Cloud-based cryptocurrency miners can choose between two distinct models. Two models of cloud-based crypto mining are described here.</p>
<p>HashPowerLeasing</p>
<p>In this model, cloud miners lease a portion of a mining farm's hashing power. To participate in the mining farm's profits, miners must subscribe to a cloud mining company plan. Miners leasing hash power from the farm pay neither setup nor maintenance fees. The mining rewards of each miner are also determined by the hashing power of each miner.</p>
<p>Cloud mining benefits</p>
<p>Cloud mining's benefits must also be mentioned. Cloud-based cryptocurrency mining is efficient and maintenance-free. Cloud mining Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies offers numerous benefits.</p>
<p>Cost-effectiveness</p>
<p>Mining in the cloud is cost-effective because miners do not require equipment. Also, miners are not required to upgrade or maintain equipment. Miners need not be concerned with electricity costs, heat and noise from mining equipment.</p>
<p>Trouble-free</p>
<p>The biggest benefit of cloud mining is that it is maintenance-free. Mining service companies maintain miners' equipment. Typically, mining service providers avoid maintenance problems by situating mining farms in cooler climates and utilizing chilling towers.</p>
<p>Support</p>
<p>Consider the technological support provided by the mining service provider. Cloud-based cryptocurrency mining requires no cryptocurrency, mining hardware, or protocol expertise. Create an account with a mining service provider and pay the hashing power fees. All account rewards can be viewed on a tablet or smartphone.</p>
<p>Miner US Launch and Services</p>
<p>Miner US offers lifetime cloud mining for cryptocurrencies based on USDT. They provide multi-algorithm, multi-coin cloud mining by utilizing cutting-edge technology. Since its inception, the company's open hash power market has been a tremendous success. Mobile apps enable users to access our services from any location.</p>
<p>Upon enrollment, new users earn 10 USDT in hashing power. As indicated in the table below, Miner US provides 150 days and exclusive lifetime mining power plans with a wide range of hash rate power.</p>
<p>VIP 1 Hashrates(GH/s) (0.00~999.99USDT) Daily earning (2.50%)</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>This year has been extremely unpredictable for crypto enthusiasts. While the overall crypto market crashed in the first half of 2022, the second half witnessed a mix of both positive and negative events. On one hand, the long-standing crypto project, FTX, became bankrupt, making tens of thousands of investors lose millions. While on the other hand, a new entrant, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN), has registered historical growth during its presale round, which is in its third phase. Due to its market viability and unique business roadmap, the value of the Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) has recorded a growth of 805% in the first two phases of its presale.</p>

<p>Binance (BNB) Takes A Dip Amid Security Questions</p>
<p>After the US Securities and Exchange Commission labeled FTT, the token of the FTX exchange, as a security in a recent filing in a New York court, several concerns have emerged about Binance&rsquo;s BNB. In its filing, the SEC noted that FTT has a buy-and-burn program similar to a stock buyback, and they both result in increasing the asset&rsquo;s value. Interestingly, Binance also has a similar program called BNB Burn, and investors wonder what will happen to their investments if the SEC initiates legal actions against Binance (BNB) as well.</p>
<p>Although Binance CEO, Changpeng Zhao, has asserted that BNB is more than just a security, he has not been able to convince investors who are considering leaving the project. Consequently, Binance (BNB) has witnessed a sharp decline of 17% in its value in the last few weeks. Currently, Binance (BNB) is being traded at $244.79, which is 65% below its all-time high of $690.93. However, Binance (BNB) continues to assure its users that the platform is healthy.</p>
<p>Binance (BNB), the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, is used for trading and paying fees on the Binance exchange. Binance (BNB), launched in 2017, can also be exchanged or traded for other cryptocurrencies, like Ethereum, Bitcoin, and more.</p>

<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) Raises Millions In Just A Few Weeks</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is the leading blockchain-based investment platform that mints equity-backed fractional NFTs to help startups raise capital quickly and cheaply. The platform also helps retail investors make investments in high-potential start-ups. With the Orbeon Protocol (ORBN), people can invest in promising start-ups for as low as $1.</p>
<p>Usually, if companies fail to raise the minimum required capital after starting the investment process, investors lose their money. But Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) has introduced a tool to tackle these issues. Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) has a &ldquo;Fill or Kill&rdquo; mechanism ensuring that all users get their money back if the investment process fails. Besides, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) promises to list only real-world growing companies on the platform to help investors choose profitable investment options.</p>
<p>The value of ORBN, the project&rsquo;s native token, has increased by more than 805% in the first three phases. ORBN tokens were launched at a price of $0.004, which now has reached $0.0362. Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is projected to post a growth rate of 6000% during the presale round. According to market analysts, the price of ORBN tokens will reach $0.24 before the presale ends.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Lee Jung-Hoon, the former chairman of South Korea's Bithumb exchange, was declared not guilty of fraud over the failed acquisition of the exchange according to a report by the Korea Economic Daily.&nbsp;</p>
Accusation
<p>In October 2018, Lee was accused of violating the Act on the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Economic Crimes while negotiating with the founder of the cosmetic surgery company BK Group, Kim Byung-gun, for the acquisition of Bithumb.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lee accepted a $70 million "contract fee" on the condition that Bithumb would list the Bithumb Coin (BXA) and use the token sale to pay for the acquisition. However, the BXA token was never listed and the acquisition fell through.&nbsp;</p>
Acquisition failure not due to investors
<p>South Korean investigators determined that the failure of the acquisition was not due to Kim or other investors, but rather due to fraudulent activity.</p>
<p>Bithumb stated that the company is run under a "professional management system," and that Lee Jung-Hoon "has no involvement in Bithumb's management." The news of Lee's acquittal follows the suicide of Park Mo, the Vice President of Vidente, who is Bithumb's largest shareholder.</p>
No show in Terra investigation
<p>In October of last year, Lee Jung-Hoon failed to appear as a witness at a hearing of the Korean National Assembly's Political Affairs Committee after being summoned. He was one of six witnesses called to testify in the ongoing investigation into the collapse of Terra, which had a $40 billion valuation. Lee cited panic disorder and claimed he was no longer involved in the management of Bithumb as a reason for not appearing.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Seeking More Upside:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 4 January 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) extended recent upside progress early in the Asian session as the pair traded above the 16700 area after trading as high as the 16789.99 area, a level that represents the 61.8% retracement of the depreciating range from 17070.86 to 16326.16.&nbsp; Additional retracement levels in this depreciating range include the 16887.47 and 16903.63 areas.&nbsp; Stops were elected above the 16693.51 area during the recent move higher, a level that represents the 50% retracement of the same depreciating range.&nbsp; Traders recently drove BTC/USD as low as the 16326.16 area after Stops were elected below the 16375.18 area, a downside retracement level related to selling pressure around the 18385.36 and 17525 levels.&nbsp; Additional related downside price objectives related to these areas of selling pressure include the 15900, 15313, and 14364 levels.&nbsp; If BTC/USD reclaims some upside momentum, additional technically significant upside retracement levels include the 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTC/USD depreciated approximately 64% in 2022, and it was off more than 3% in December.&nbsp; Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, the 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Below these areas, technically significant levels include the 14613, 14500.15, 13369, 10432.73, 10727, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;below the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;100-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 16738.04 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 16664.93.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Michael Burry, an investor who was featured in the book and movie "The Big Short," has said that the US will have a recession and more inflation in 2023. He thinks that inflation is currently very high, but it will not remain so.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Inflation peaked. But it is not the last peak of this cycle. We are likely to see CPI lower, possibly negative in 2H 2023, and the US in recession by any definition. Fed will cut and government will stimulate. And we will have another inflation spike. It's not hard.</p>

</p>
<p>He believes that the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures how much prices have gone up, could be expected to go down a lot in the new year and might even go negative in the second half of 2023, causing a recession.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In June, inflation in the US was 9.1%, which is the highest it has been in 40 years. In November, it was still above 7%. These numbers are much higher than the 2% goal set by the Federal Reserve. Because of this, the Federal Reserve increased the base interest rate, which is the rate at which banks can borrow money, from almost 0% to over 4%, with a plan to make it go even higher in 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Higher interest rates can help lower inflation by decreasing how much people buy, invest, and work, but they can also make it harder for businesses to make money and slow down the economy, which can lead to a recession and make investment prices go down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Burry says that in 2023, inflation will go down and the economy will get weaker. He then expects the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates and the government to spend more money to try to make the economy grow, causing inflation to spike yet again.</p>
Opinion
<p>This seesaw process has always happened since central banks were given control over monetary policy. As the Federal Reserve continues to ramp up interest rates it would appear that it is doing so blindly, given that the increases will take many months before they are properly felt in the market.</p>
<p>The problem will be that once inflation starts coming down significantly, it is likely that the economy will already be in a serious recession, and then the Fed will have to start trying to tip the scales in the other direction by unleashing yet another round of quantitative easing.</p>
<p>The up and down seesaw in the economy is worsening as debt increases and fiat purchasing power decreases. This is why Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies were born. Over a long period Bitcoin might just become that inflation hedge, and out of the crypto sector might arrive a decentralised way of transacting that saves us all from the hell of central banks and their fiat currencies.</p>
