<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/charles-hoskinson-says-indias-anti-crypto-regulatory-environment-is-preventing-cardanos-entry/">Charles Hoskinson</a>, the co-founder of Cardano, has hit back at XRP supporters over claims that he was trying to damage Ripple’s reputation and create FUD against the embattled network.</p>



<p>In a six-minute video Friday, Hoskinson expressed frustrations over how some <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-whales-are-moving-millions-from-binance-as-looming-litigation-causes-record-outflows/">XRP community</a> members had responded to comments he made concerning the projected time the SEC vs Ripple case would likely end.</p>



<p>“<em>I talked a bit about a rumour that I had heard from a pretty reliable source who was close to the case about a potential resolution of the case by December 15<sup>th</sup>. So, I just threw it out there and said, well, that’s something I’ve heard,</em>” he said referring to comments he made in a surprise Ask Me Anything (AMA) session on Monday, Dec 12.</p>



<p>According to Hoskinson, it was perfectly normal to reference the XRP case when asked whether Cardano was a security because the Ripple case is one of the corollaries to any cryptocurrencies being securities.</p>



<p>However, despite clarifying that he had made the comments out of a “rumour”, many people in both the XRP community and the media started spreading the word that Charles Hoskinson believed the case was going to get settled on December 15<sup>th</sup>.</p>



<p><em>“After it didn’t get resolved, I was accused of lying and I was accused of yet again creating a FUD and trolling,”</em> he said.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-xrp-adherents"><strong>XRP Adherents</strong></h2>



<p>Hoskinson, who claimed to have been supportive of Ripple’s initiatives and efforts to popularize cryptocurrency, blamed a section of Ripple supporters for allegedly being close-minded.</p>



<p>Apart from not believing that XRP <a href="https://zycrypto.com/microstrategys-saylor-says-xrp-is-a-security-touts-bitcoin-as-the-only-crypto-commodity/">is a security</a>, he noted that he did not think that the SEC was bribed to go after Ripple, saying that those claims were “a conspiracy”. Further, he noted that although Ethereum did get gentler treatment for some reason than others, that did not necessarily mean that there was bribery and corruption.</p>



<p><em>“For saying that,</em> I was mocked, harassed and brutalized by the XRP community, and yet again,<em> now I’m being brutalized.”</em></p>



<p><em>“So, it has left me asking, ‘is there any value at all in mentioning, engaging with or discussing anything about XRP?’ and at this juncture, given what’s happened,</em> I don’t think there is…If asked in the future about XRP,<em> I’m just going to say “NO COMMENT”,</em> he concluded, noting that never in his career in the crypto space had he encountered a community so willing to attack a person who frankly has not attacked them viciously.</p>

<p>Following the collapse of FTX, questions about what could have happened have been raging. In the past week, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao” CZ” and Canadian investor Kevin O’Leary have also been engaging in a fiery battle of words for their alleged involvement with FTX.</p>



<p>Despite the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ftxs-founder-sam-bankman-fried-arrested-in-the-bahamas/">arrest of Sam Bankman-fried</a> “SBF”, the ex-CEO of FTX in the Bahamas on Dec 12, Congressional hearings on the FTX debacle kicked off as planned mid-week. Kevin O’Leary, accused of receiving $15 million to promote FTX despite allegedly knowing the exchange’s fraudulent activities testified on Dec 14. When asked by Senator Pat Toomey why he thought FTX failed, he noted that FTX and Binance were at war with each other, putting the other out of business intentionally. “<em>Binance is a massive unregulated global monopoly now. They put FTX out of business,” </em>he said.</p>



<p>In an interview with CNBC’s Squawk Box afterwards, O’Leary stated that he had contacted SBF before his arrest, seeking answers on the circumstances leading to the collapse. According to him, SBF allegedly stated that they had spent $2 to $3 billion in “off-balance sheet funds” buying back FTX stock from Binance to try and prevent FTX’s collapse.</p>



<p>As it may be recalled, before the collapse of FTX in early November, CZ tweeted that they would <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-to-liquidate-ftxs-ftt-holdings-due-to-recent-revelations/">liquidate the entirety</a> of its position in FTX Token (totalling $2.1 billion) after a leaked balance sheet disclosed most FTX holdings were tied up in FTT. Less than three days after the tweet, FTT plunged roughly 94%, rendering the exchange bankrupt.</p>



<p>According to O’Leary, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-ceo-cz-blasts-kevin-oleary-for-supposedly-defending-ftx/">CZ orchestrated FTX’s collapse</a> due to irresponsible communication. “<em>Why in the world would a block trade, like the one by CZ, be tweeted out saying- I have $550 million worth of FTT tokens. I&#8217;m going to put to the market?- You don’t trade like that. You go find buyers, you form a syndicate and you clear market with a trade,”</em> O’Leary charged.</p>



<p>On Thursday, CZ fired back, calling O’Leary a liar and accusing him of making a “bunch of nonsense claims.” According to the Binance CEO, it was suspicious that O’Leary had chosen only to take up what SBF had told him as the truth without digging deeper. He further accused the 68-year-old investor of ignoring all the “small spendings” by FTX and instead focusing on Binance’s sale of FTT.</p>



<p><em>“He (O’Leary) says he did not know that Binance was a shareholder of FTX, so he invested in FTX without looking at the cap table, but he was very specific in the way he accounts for a transaction two years ago, so that’s kind of contradictory,” </em>said CZ<em>. “So, I think Kevin is a liar, I think he is lying about a bunch of stuff”</em>. On Friday, O’Leary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2feTmaguqhU&amp;ab_channel=CNBCTelevision">responded,</a> arguing that CZ’s accusations against him were a lie.</p>



<p>That said, as the war between the two businessmen rages on, the possibility of arrests or a Madoff Clawback for funds received from FTX being imposed on the two businessmen has become a concern for the crypto community.</p>

<p>Just a year ago, the cryptocurrency market recorded one of the best yearly runs <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-whales-double-down-on-gigantic-btc-buys-despite-macro-headwinds/">Bitcoin</a> has ever had. While bearish calls were made early into 2021, Bitcoin bulls pushed prices to a staggering $68,000 in November of the same year.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-is-bitcoin-headed-in-2023-the-bearish"><strong>Where is Bitcoin headed in 2023?; The bearish</strong></h2>



<p>Positive sentiments began to flood the Bitcoin community, and major price predictions were made ahead of 2022. But Bitcoin would underperform, starting the new year with a massive price decline. </p>



<p>January saw Bitcoin at $35,000; Prices fluctuated between $30,000 &#8211; $45,000 between January and June.</p>



<p>The months leading up to December would see Bitcoin slowly lose momentum and go downhill. Although key players were still bullish, the recent events plaguing the market have swayed prominent voices.</p>



<p>From VanEck, a leading global investment manager offering U.S. investors exposure to gold and ETF investment, Bitcoin is expected to decline by 29.4% from its press time price of $16,789. This, however, is only going to persist from January till March.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="647" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-4-1024x647.png" alt="" class="wp-image-76530" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-4-1024x647.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-4-300x190.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-4-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-4-1536x971.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-4-2048x1294.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTCUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>“<em>Bitcoin will test $10-12K in Q1 amid a wave of miner bankruptcies, which will mark the low point of the crypto winter.” </em>&#8211; VanEck.</p>



<p>From April till June, Bitcoin is expected to take a leap upward, as inflation and other surrounding activities are cited as factors that could spur the next bull run for the leading cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>VanEck explains in a recent tweet below, saying; </p>



<p><em>“In the second half of 2023, Bitcoin will rise to $30K. Lower inflation, easing energy concerns, a possible truce in Ukraine, and a turnaround in M2 supply will power the start of a new bull market.”  </em></p>



<h2><strong>Bitcoin 2023; The bullish </strong></h2>



<p>Taking a more bullish approach is Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of BitMEX.</p>



<p>He recently expressed certainty that Bitcoin miners and centralized exchanges that swayed market movement by selling Bitcoin in large quantities will no longer drive lower prices.</p>



<p>Maintaining that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/former-bitmex-ceo-arthur-hayes-on-why-bitcoin-price-has-likely-reached-bottom/">Bitcoin has bottomed</a>, he reckons that liquidations will be halted as sellers are already done selling. More importantly, he looks to the federal reserve to revive risk assets like Bitcoin by implementing new monetary policies. An even more bullish Tim Draper forecasted $250,000 for Bitcoin by late 2022 or early 2023.</p>



<p>While Bitcoin is attempting to clutch $20,000 before the year&#8217;s close, it isn&#8217;t very likely, considering existing market conditions, that $250,000 will be attained this year.</p>



<p>Most analysts and investors remain fixed on the possible outcome for Bitcoin next year. Key figures have also expressed bullish sentiments for altcoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA).</p>

<p>Blockchain analytics provider CryptoQuant sees an Ethereum (ETH) price blackout on the horizon. According to CryptoQuant, potential negative fundamental factors could precipitate a mass sell-off event for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.</p>



<h2><strong>Why A Vicious ETH Sell-Off Is Likely</strong></h2>



<p>CryptoQuant has pinpointed issues that could trigger a full-blown ETH correction.</p>



<p>The first potential catalyst is the dramatic increase of inflows into the ETH 2.0 deposit contract, where staked ether is trapped until the implementation of the next big upgrade, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/gargantuan-feat-staked-ether-withdrawals-are-coming-in-march-2023-core-developers-concur/">Shanghai</a>. The amount locked in the contract now represents 12% of the total ETH supply. A chart shared by CryptoQuant shows that the amount of new depositors has been dropping.</p>



<p>With a target release time frame of March 2023, the Shanghai hard fork will make it possible to withdraw staked ETH, tying up loose ends from the monumental September Merge update.</p>



<p>The second factor is that ether balances on centralized exchanges continue declining. Analysts at the on-chain analytics platform harbour the opinion that the forthcoming Shanghai upgrade will likely initiate a major ether sell-off due to the staked ETH withdrawals. There&#8217;s some $18.9 billion worth of ether currently staked with the network at press time, according to data aggregated on Dune Analytics.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-future-outlook-for-the-eth-ecosystem"><strong>The Future Outlook For The ETH Ecosystem</strong></h2>



<p>It’s now over one year since the crypto market peaked in November 2021, and there are no signs of a new bull rally commencing in the near term. Cryptocurrencies were <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-and-ethereum-take-a-nosedive-as-fed-signal-more-interest-rates-hike/">shaken </a>yesterday following a hawkish speech from the U.S. Central bank. The Fed on Wednesday raised interest rates by 50 basis points as it continues to slow the economy.</p>



<p>While it&#8217;s difficult to predict which way the market will move, some believe the positive change in ether&#8217;s tokenomics brought about by the Merge technological upgrade could ultimately help the cryptocurrency outperform bitcoin and the broader market once the FTX contagion ebbs and the macroeconomic conditions improve.</p>



<p>Ether is changing hands at $1,177 as of press time, a 4.55% drop over the last 24 hours. Perhaps time will tell whether the No. 2 crypto is due for an epic dump or a bullish trend reversal.</p>

<p>Following the downfall of FTX, different countries are looking to tighten their policies, specifically for digital currencies, in an attempt to safeguard investor funds.</p>



<h2 id="h-key-investors-at-risk-following-the-new-development"><strong>Key investors at risk following the new development</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>It appears that Canada is taking this path, as it recently took steps towards restructuring its regulations by placing a ban on Margin and Leverage trading for digital currencies.</p>



<p>Companies affiliated with cryptocurrency trading were informed about the recent development in an update made by the official organization of Canada&#8217;s provincial and territorial securities regulators, also known as the Canadian securities Administration (CSA).</p>



<p>In the update, it is made known that a revaluation of existing requirements has taken place, leading to the conclusion that said requirements need to be “expanded across all cryptocurrency platforms within the country&#8221;.</p>



<p>Excerpts from the update, as seen on the official securities regulator site, reads as follows; </p>



<p><em>“Custodians will generally be considered qualified if they are regulated by a financial regulator in Canada, the U.S., or a similar jurisdiction with a supervisory regime for conduct and financial regulation.”</em></p>



<p>The implementation process will be carried out by both the CSA and other crypto trading platforms.</p>



<p>“<em>CSA members will contact registered crypto trading platforms individually to discuss the application of the expanded terms and conditions to those firms. The CSA will publish further details about this updated approach in the future.”</em></p>



<p>The move&#8217;s effects on cryptocurrency trading platforms in Canada might include a decline in Cryptocurrency trading activities over time. Cryptocurrency trading platforms operating in the country might need to halt the banned options in order to maintain the law. Larger investors are significantly at risk, as margin trading requires using borrowed capital in larger sums from a brokerage.</p>



<p>Exchanges offering cryptocurrency trading might also record a loss in revenue, as it shuts its doors to two of the most commonly used cryptocurrency trading methods. Canadian investors are also likely to record losses, as it is uncertain whether or not they would look elsewhere to continue their trading activities.</p>

<p>Gary Harmon, a 31-year-old man from Ohio, is set to plead guilty after being charged with stealing 713 bitcoins stored in a Trezor hardware wallet seized by the US government. Garry was arrested in July 2021 and arraigned on money laundering charges, among other crimes, after the bitcoins (worth around $5 million) were stolen remotely “as authorities looked on helplessly.”</p>



<h2 id="h-a-story-of-two-brothers"><strong>A Story of Two Brothers</strong></h2>



<p>The said device had first been confiscated from Larry Harmon, then CEO of early bitcoin mixing services Coin Ninja and DropBit and elder brother to Gary. Larry had been arrested in 2020 in connection to laundering $311 million in crypto through Darknet websites linked to illegal drugs, becoming the first person in the US to be charged with crimes related to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardanos-hoskinson-slams-the-us-treasury-for-banning-tornado-cash/">crypto mixing.</a></p>



<p>According to court documents, Gary Harmon attended two of his brother’s bail hearings and noted that the prosecutors lacked the seed recovery phrase required to access more than 4,800 bitcoins seized from his brother. Prosecutors suspected that Gary generated a seed phrase to retrieve the private keys, which enabled him to go online, key in a pin and drain the wallet.</p>



<h2><strong>Gary’s Downfall</strong></h2>



<p>Gary’s downfall came after his lifestyle drastically changed shortly after the theft, raising suspicion. Indeed, although prosecutors at first suspected Larry was behind the theft after being released on bail, Larry told them that the culprit was his brother, which helped strengthen their case against Gary.</p>



<p>Although court records showed that Gary lived on stimulus funds and unemployment checks, prosecutors were baffled by photos showing Gary “smiling smugly in a hot tub full of cash and surrounded by scantily clad women.”</p>



<p>Further investigations showed that Garry used two crypto mixers to hide traces of 519 of the stolen Bitcoins. Prosecutors also claimed that Gary had posted 68 bitcoins as collateral for a $1.2 million loan. In contrast, another portion of it has been spent on the purchase of a luxury condo in Cleveland.</p>



<p>That said, Gary, 31, is expected to appear on Dec 22 in a Washington-based federal court for a plea deal hearing to which he is set to plead guilty based on the latest court records.</p>



<p>While it is easy to trace the movement of cryptocurrencies via the blockchain, crypto-mixing platforms enable money launderers and other nefarious actors to obfuscate transactions making it harder to track stolen funds. This year, the US <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-treasury-sanctions-notorious-crypto-mixer-tornado-cash/">banned Tornado Cash</a>, a notorious crypto mixer alleged to have helped launder billions of dollars in crypto, attracting praise and condemnation.</p>

<p>SOL token lost 9.5% Friday to trade at $12.82 &#8211; according to CoinMarketCap &#8211; after <a href="https://zycrypto.com/hopes-high-as-charles-hoskinson-speaks-on-solana-becoming-a-sidechain-to-cardano/">Solana</a>-based decentralized exchange Raydium was compromised for $2.2 million. In an afternoon <a href="https://twitter.com/RaydiumProtocol/status/1603762271028748289?s=20&amp;t=BRoVaUUWRSckHGIvoCAweg">tweet</a> on December 16, Raydium protocol wrote that the hacker overrode owners&#8217; authority in the liquidity pools.</p>



<p>&#8220;<em>An exploit on Raydium is being investigated that affected liquidity pools</em>,&#8221; the tweet read. The post, which included the hacker&#8217;s account details, added that the &#8220;<em>initial understanding is the attacker overtook owner authority, but the authority has been halted on AMM &amp; farm programs for now</em>.&#8221;</p>



<p>The exploit was discovered at around 2 PM UTC on Dec. 16, when Raydium admin posted 1,000 transactions to the Solana network – where each transaction moved liquidity without depositing an equivalent LP token. The vulnerability allowed the bad actor to access the LPs&#8217; funds – draining USDC, Wrapped SOL, and native Raydium token RAY.</p>



<p>Per data from analytics firm Nansen, &#8220;<em>The wallet draining LP Pools from Raydium liquidity pools has received over $2.2 million now, including $1.6 million SOL</em>,&#8221; the company shared the information on its official Twitter account.</p>



<h2 id="h-major-platforms-on-raydium-including-prism-and-compendium-withdraw-funds"><strong>Major platforms on Raydium, including Prism and Compendium, withdraw funds</strong></h2>



<p>Responding to the security breach, notable platforms based on Raydium have withdrawn their assets &#8211; even as the online crypto community faults the DEX for not having a multisig cold storage.</p>



<p>Compendium Foundation announced that it had temporarily withdrawn $CMFI, $USDC, and $SOL liquidity from Raydium following the incident. According to the firm,&#8221; <em>the attacker gained access to keys used (for collecting) fees from LP pools, and authority has since been halted</em>.&#8221;</p>



<p>PRISM – a DEX aggregator aggregating liquidity sources across Raydium and Solana – has also pulled its fund from the exchange. The platform withdrew PRISM/USDC liquidity from Raydium, urging users to do the same. Per Prism&#8217;s account of the events, the malicious wallet was &#8220;<em>draining LP pools from Raydium liquidity pools using admin wallet as a signer without burning LP tokens</em>.&#8221;</p>



<p>Raydium is a decentralized exchange on Solana that allows users to trade varying cryptocurrencies without intermediaries. According to data from DeFi aggregator DefiLlama, Raydium&#8217;s total value locked (TVL) is $36 million &#8211; down 98% from a high of $2.21 billion in November before the fall of FTX.</p>

<p>Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, plunged further Friday as <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-and-ethereum-take-a-nosedive-as-fed-signal-more-interest-rates-hike/">hawkish comments</a> by Fed’s Chair Jeremy Powell on Wednesday continued to weigh down on investors.</p>



<p>Since tapping an all-time high in November last year, Bitcoin has lost over 75% of its value thanks to a myriad of factors. Attempts by price to recover were thwarted earlier last month by the unexpected debacle of crypto exchange FTX, sending prices below the $18,300 psychological support, which has increasingly become harder for bulls to breach.</p>



<p>According to data from IntoTheBlock, only 36% of BTC holders are making a profit at current prices, 14% are at breakeven, and 51% are in the red. Notably, a majority of those in profit are investors who have held coins for more than one year. Further, a majority of investors continue to hold a bearish outlook on Bitcoin, which is one of the most prevalent signals of an impending trend change.</p>



<h2 id="h-investors-scoop-more-btc"><strong>Investors Scoop More BTC</strong></h2>



<p>However, despite the continued drop in crypto prices, the number of Bitcoin investors stacking BTC recently has been rising, based on data by Glassnode.</p>



<p><em>“Bitcoin&#8217;s addresses holding between 100 to 10,000 BTC have bought $726m in BTC the past 9 days,”</em> Glassnode wrote on Thursday, adding that 40,747 more Bitcoin (worth $726 million) had collectively entered those key whale wallets within that period. It is important to note that this category represents only 0.0364% of all BTC addresses. However, despite being small, this group typically makes decisions leading to future price movements.</p>



<p>Stablecoins have also been painting an encouraging picture. <em>“Stablecoin assets like USDT, BUSD, &amp; DAI are also being bought quickly. This is a recipe for good things,”</em> the firm added.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/hWazW20CMd3lmIU_5lzPxqeUbOBwFfgkIoEykxXU4Q4_lDXJQ279dQIyil1hLkhjauaoAyuodsaZAjiTXWG9ZrYv7D-Wx32LGtVUnzri_XKLTDl8XxdVroj2PGzy0TJz4Zg8o-uopdmSxMcttYGEgfmwm0uPVgf-6Ra2blaRtyVdWNXt5oQb_h6rP9lVGhNrWFiIXaqP_w" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The chart above illustrates the percentage of supply held by key price-moving addresses for BTC, USDT, USDC, BUSD, and DAI and can be used to reveal the future of crypto prices.</p>



<p>According to the firm, “<em>when these lines are mainly going down, it&#8217;s not a great sign”</em> because it suggests wealthy players and institutional investors are exiting the markets. The chart thus depicts increased interest by more prominent players to purchase the said assets after reducing their holdings for about 14 months straight. Although we are yet to see a turnaround in price, with whales finally accumulating rather than dumping, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/former-bitmex-ceo-arthur-hayes-on-why-bitcoin-price-has-likely-reached-bottom/">Bitcoin&#8217;s ebbing tide</a> may be in the offing.</p>



<p>At press time, the largest cryptocurrency by market value was trading at $16,829 after a 3.84% decrease in the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Earlier yesterday, the price attempted to recover, surging as much as $17,486 after bouncing off weekly support at $17,250 before deteriorating.</p>

<ul>
<li>The New York State Department of Financial Services has issued a new guideline to protect customers against the dangers of another cryptocurrency crash.</li>



<li>The new policy will make banks submit a detailed business plan to the body 90 days before they delve into cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</li>



<li>As New York takes the bull by the horn, other jurisdictions are expected to follow suit in the coming months.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>A cross-section of players in the digital asset industry believes it needs strategic regulations across all sectors to bring up dwindling confidence among investors.</p>



<p>The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has released a new cryptocurrency regulation for banks and other financial institutions in its jurisdiction. The new guideline gives banks a 90-day window to submit a business plan to the authorities before dealing with digital asset firms.</p>



<p>As more banks and institutions delve into digital assets, the guideline will act as checks to monitor their investments and levels of exposure. The business plan submitted must be detailed, capturing key areas to enable the DFS to carry out consumer protection analysis, corporate governance, and oversight, as well as risk analysis.</p>



<p>The hallmark of this new move, according to the NYDFS, is to protect consumers&#8217; “hard-earned money” in the wake of the FTX collapse. </p>



<p>“<em>It is critical that regulators communicate in a timely, transparent manner about the evolution of our regulatory approach</em>,” NYDFS Superintendent Adrienne A. Harris highlighted in a statement issued by the department.</p>



<p>The NYDFS, in a statement, said that the regulation is final as it deals with essential issues in protecting users but promised to continue engaging with stakeholders in the industry to make better laws.</p>



<h2 id="h-more-regulations-to-follow"><strong>More regulations to follow</strong></h2>



<p>As New York releases a new guideline for banks, several jurisdictions within and outside the United States are pushing for broader and more robust cryptocurrency regulations to prevent a repeat of FTX. At the FTX hearing yesterday, Kevin O’Leary, executive producer of Shark Tank, and Sen. Cynthia Lummis stressed the need for more <a href="https://zycrypto.com/a-deliberate-move-shark-tank-star-kevin-oleary-blames-binance-for-ftx-collapse/">regulation</a> to “<em>save the industry.”</em></p>



<p>The Deputy Secretary US Treasury, Wally Adeyemo, has called for more international cooperation to regulate the industry, which will promote stability and prevent the illegal use of digital assets.</p>



<p>Across industry spaces, users&#8217; and investors’ confidence went a step back following the FTX issue, leading to widespread fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). As new and tighter regulations begin to take effect, it creates a ripple effect of increasing investor confidence and pushing back FUDs in users in the long run.</p>

<p>The NFT community, alongside the broader cryptocurrency market, has expressed shock over the recent announcement from former U.S. President <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cryptocurrency-explosion-is-coming-former-u-s-president-donald-trump-warns/">Donald Trump</a>. In what most have termed one of the most unexpected “announcements”  in the NFT ecosystem this year, Trump has put up some Superman-based NFT trading cards for sale.</p>



<h2 id="h-doland-trump-receives-feedback-from-concerned-supporters"><strong>Doland Trump receives feedback from concerned supporters</strong></h2>



<p>The announcement was made on his own social media platform called “Truth Social.” It has since been received positively on the platform, with over 1,000 post shares and over 3,000 comments. The card shows Trump dressed in the famous Superman full-body suit, while a rage with the letter “T” is labelled on the suit.</p>



<p><strong>“</strong>MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT! My official Donald Trump Digital Trading Card collection is here,” he said on the platform. </p>



<p>He then revealed some details about the cards, noting that they were limited while adding that they are significant for their connection to his personal life and career.</p>



<p>As excerpts of the statement read;</p>



<p><em>“These limited edition cards feature amazing ART of my Life &amp; Career! Collect all your favorite Trump Digital Trading Cards, very much like a baseball card, but hopefully much more exciting.”</em></p>



<p>NFT collectors and onlookers alike have voiced concerns about the price, which they consider extremely low, especially coming from the former President. However, Trump assured that they would be acquired and sold out in no time.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;GET YOUR CARDS NOW! Only $99 each! Would make a great Christmas gift. Don&#8217;t Wait. They will be gone, I believe, very quickly!” He urged.</em></p>



<p>While the NFT community awaits the sale turnout, Twitter users in the NFT community have expressed dissatisfaction with the move. Their collective sentiments highlight shock, mirroring their disapproval of the cards,  which they believe isn’t worth it.</p>



<p>One critique is quoted saying; “Trump is releasing NFT trading cards of himself… it really is the end of the road,&#8221;</p>



<h2><strong>NFT market hurdles persist</strong></h2>



<p>Meanwhile, the NFT market is still bearish, as the decline in NFT sales persists.</p>



<p>The NFT market has gone from $1.02 trillion to $970.03 billion from January to September 2022. In November alone, NFT sales volume declined by 20%. </p>



<p>Popular entrepreneur Gary Vee attempted to grace the root cause of the problem by citing greed, oversupply and mediocre project launch as some of the factors propelling the industry’s downfall.</p>

<p>Crypto exchange KuCoin is operating in the Netherlands without the appropriate license, according to the De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) — the Dutch central bank.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-kucoin-is-illegally-operating-in-the-netherlands-authorities">&#8216;<strong>KuCoin Is Illegally Operating In the Netherlands&#8217;: Authorities</strong></h2>



<p>De Nederlandsche Bank has issued a warning to the KuCoin exchange for offering crypto services to local residents.</p>



<p>In a December 15 statement, the central bank said that MEK Global Limited (MGL), registered in Seychelles and does business in the Netherlands as KuCoin, was not compliant with the country’s Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act. According to De Nederlandsche Bank, KuCoin is illegally offering crypto services as well as custodian wallets without the required legal registration.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">DNB warns against MEK Global Limited, doing business as KuCoin<a href="https://t.co/kgh6XVkYbI">https://t.co/kgh6XVkYbI</a></p>&mdash; De Nederlandsche Bank (@DNB_NL) <a href="https://twitter.com/DNB_NL/status/1603360786755325952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 15, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>MGL Customers are not in breach of the legislation, the bank noted. “However, this may increase the risk of customers becoming involved in money laundering or terrorist financing.”</p>



<p>As one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world by trading volume, KuCoin has often been the centre of several regulatory duals around the world amid the crypto market turmoil and the implosion of the FTX exchange.</p>



<p>KuCoin chief executive officer, Johnny Lyu, <a href="https://twitter.com/lyu_johnny/status/1543062668051120128">dismissed </a>rumours of the exchange being insolvent in July. He added that the exchange had no plans to halt withdrawals and that KuCoin was operating well.</p>



<p>Cryptocurrency exchange Binance was slapped with similar allegations in 2021, as Dutch regulators stated that the firm was operating illegally. Binance ultimately <a href="https://zycrypto.com/dutch-central-bank-nukes-crypto-exchange-binance-with-3-4-million-fine/">paid an administrative fine of $3.4 million</a> for offering services to Dutch citizens without being registered in the Netherlands.</p>



<p>Like KuCoin and Binance, Coinbase grabbed headlines in the Netherlands in 2022. But unlike the other two exchanges, the American publicly-traded firm was in the limelight for becoming the first-ever major crypto exchange to win regulatory approval from the Dutch Central bank.</p>

<p>Leading Ethereum software company Consensys has partnered with PayPal to enable US customers to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ethereum-whales-ignore-market-tsunami-splashing-nearly-a-billion-dollars-on-fresh-eth-buys/">purchase Ethereum</a>. According to a Wednesday announcement, <em>“PayPal will seamlessly integrate within the MetaMask wallet, providing customers with a simple and convenient way to buy Ethereum with PayPal.”</em></p>



<p>However, the functionality will only be available to eligible PayPal application users in the U.S. Following the integration, Metamask becomes the first Web3 wallet to leverage PayPal to drive on-ramp transactions. Commenting on the newly achieved milestone, Lorenzo Santos, Product Manager for MetaMask, said, “<em>This integration with PayPal will allow our U.S. users to not just buy crypto seamlessly through MetaMask, but also to easily explore the Web3 ecosystem.”</em> </p>



<p>The MetaMask and PayPal integration comes even as the two firms <a href="https://zycrypto.com/russian-banking-giant-sber-adds-ethereum-and-metamask-support/">double down</a> on their push for more diversified crypto payment options. Launched in 2016, MetaMask is the world’s leading non-custodial crypto wallet and boasts more than 30 million monthly active users, according to a recent report. Apart from being a mobile app, the wallet has a browser extension that acts as a cryptocurrency wallet for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and any Ethereum-compatible networks.</p>



<p>Metamask offers a bushel of functionalities, including enabling users to interact with NFT marketplaces, play and earn games, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and metaverse worlds.</p>



<p>Notably, due to the spike in demand for digital assets by institutions, MetaMask has increasingly focused on meeting the needs of that particular group through its MetaMask Institutional (MMI) service. In the past year or so, MetaMask has onboarded more than five institutional custodians to enhance choice, security, and operational efficiency for crypto funds, market-makers, trading desks, DAOs and other organizations seeking exposure to the digital asset class.</p>



<p>PayPal officially <a href="https://zycrypto.com/paypal-finally-enables-bitcoin-transfers-to-third-party-crypto-wallets-and-exchanges/">unveiled crypto services</a> in the US on June 7 2022, allowing customers the flexibility to move Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin between Paypal and other wallets or exchanges. According to the most recent report by the company, there are about 429 million active PayPal users worldwide, with 75% of Americans using the service. Recently, the payments company expanded its crypto services to Luxembourg, signalling its intention to expand to the entire European union while complying with existing and pending regulations.</p>

<li>BTC, ETH, and SOL shed value on Wednesday following the central bank’s decision to increase interest rates again.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Digital assets were not alone as the stock market also dipped following the news, further signifying trading correlation. </li>



<li>A cross-section of digital asset enthusiasts expressed worry that their favourite assets may have blown their last opportunity for an uptick before the end of the year.</li>
</ul>



<p>Market leader Bitcoin (BTC) traded above $18,000 for the first time since the FTX crash, to the delight of users, but the joy was short-lived in the early hours of Wednesday.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="647" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-3-1024x647.png" alt="" class="wp-image-76473" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-3-1024x647.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-3-300x190.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-3-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-3-1536x971.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-3-2048x1294.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTCUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/news/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Major digital currencies tumbled following the news of an increased interest rate approved by the Federal Reserve, wiping off little gains made in the past few days. BTC was already flying above $18k, trading at $18,310, lost 4.77% a few hours after the announcement and is currently exchanging hands at $17,404.</p>



<p>Ethereum (ETH) and Dogecoin (DOGE) followed the trend losing about 5.5% and 6.38%, respectively. This year has not been great for ETH as it keeps struggling despite all the prospects it held at the start of the year. The altcoin giant is valued at $1,270 just a few weeks before the year&#8217;s end, which has seen it lose over 50% of its value.</p>



<p>For the greater part of the year, the stock market and the cryptocurrency market have <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-cuts-link-with-the-stock-market-thanks-to-a-spike-in-the-number-of-long-term-hodlers/">traded</a> similarly under the influence of wider macroeconomic trends. Yesterday was no different, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 103 points following the news while the S&amp;P 500 fell by 0.5%.</p>



<p>With these frequent rises in interest rates, investors keep moving away from high-risk assets making the market take a bearish trend.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-users-cannot-see-the-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel"><strong>Users cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel</strong></h2>



<p>The Federal Reserve has used hikes in interest rates to counter inflationary trends in the market in recent months across various regions. Though the recent increase was by 0.5 points, the bank has signalled more increases in the coming months to push back inflation.</p>



<p>Most digital asset enthusiasts have described this year as unfortunate for the market due to major <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ftx-token-crashes-85-in-minutes-ftt-becoming-the-next-luna/">incidents</a> that have hit the industry, wiping billions from the market cap. The larger crypto market cap is now a shadow of its former self as it struggles below $1 trillion. Even with the present negative trends, some users have expressed hopes for a better 2023.</p>

<li>Kevin O’Leary has roped Binance into the infamous FTX scandal, claiming that the exchange deliberately caused the collapse. </li>



<li>He also called for increased regulation in the industry, hinting that, at the end of the day, only proper laws will save the market. </li>



<li>Fear and doubts from investors still loom over the market as the FTX hearing proceeds.</li>
</ul>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried, Alameda Capital, and now Binance, the blame game, continue for FTX&#8217;s woes which put the market multiple steps backwards.</p>



<p>Canadian businessman and co-executive producer of the reality show Shark Tank, Kevin O’Leary, has blamed Binance for the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ftx-token-crashes-85-in-minutes-ftt-becoming-the-next-luna/">collapse</a> of fellow exchange FTX despite its effort to save FTX at the early stages of the saga.</p>



<p>Speaking at the US Senate in the FTX hearing titled “Why the FTX Bubble Burst and the Harm to Consumers,” O’Leary used strong words to describe Binance&#8217;s involvement in the FTX debacle. He claimed that Binance caused it on purpose and is now a “<em>massive, unregulated monopoly now.</em>”</p>



<p>Explaining his views, he stated that the CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-to-liquidate-ftxs-ftt-holdings-due-to-recent-revelations/">disclosed</a> that he would begin to sell FTX native tokens on Binance, a move that led to the bankruptcy filing a few days later.</p>



<p>O’Leary called for more regulations around the industry to avoid a repeat of the ugly incident and to gain investor confidence. According to him, LedgerX, an FTX-owned derivatives trading platform, was the only “<em>entity that didn’t go to zero” </em>due to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s regulation.</p>



<p>Senator Cynthia Lummis toed the path of O’Leary during the session pushing for more regulations in the market.</p>



<p><em>“It is time to separate digital assets from corrupt organizations. FTX is good old-fashioned fraud. Mismanagement, failure of people, and inadequate controls are what’s on trial. We need to regulate this business and lay digital assets on top of our existing financial framework.”</em></p>



<h2 id="h-binance-new-monopoly"><strong>Binance new monopoly </strong></h2>



<p>Following the collapse of FTX, a major competition of Binance, it is now perceived as having an unhealthy monopoly in the market. However, Binance has been the leading crypto exchange for many years. O’Leary is not alone in this, as many users feel Binance is now heading to a point where it cannot be matched by its competition and can dictate what happens in the industry.</p>



<p>A Binance monopoly is considered by analysts as unhealthy for the industry, just as O’Leary pointed out, as it could lead to centralization. Last week, users withdrew over $8 billion from Binance though the CEO described it as “business as usual.” Binance currently dominates the market with a 24-hour trading volume of over $12 billion.</p>
