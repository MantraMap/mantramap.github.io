<h2>Fed Governor on Crypto, US Economy, and Inflation</h2>
<p>Michelle Bowman, a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, talked about cryptocurrency, the U.S. economy, and the Fed&#8217;s effort to lower inflation Tuesday at a Florida Bankers Association Leadership event in Miami.</p>
<p>Commenting on the collapse of crypto exchange FTX and other recent events in the crypto space, the Fed governor said: &#8220;These events have made it clear that cryptocurrency activities can pose significant risks to consumers, businesses, and potentially the larger financial system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Noting that she expects some banks to continue exploring &#8220;how to engage in crypto-related activities,&#8221; Bowman emphasized:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Fed and other banking agencies will continue to focus in this area, in light of the significant risks these activities may pose. But the bottom line is that we do not want to hinder innovation.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;As regulators, we should support innovation and recognize that the banking industry must evolve to meet consumer demand,&#8221; the Fed governor continued.</p>
<p>&#8220;By inhibiting innovation, we could be pushing growth in this space into the non-bank sector, leading to much less transparency and potential financial stability risk. We are thinking through some of these issues and what a regulatory approach could look like,&#8221; she opined.</p>

<p>Regarding the Federal Reserve&#8217;s fight against inflation, Governor Bowman stated that she has supported the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)&#8217;s policy actions to address high inflation over the past year. &#8220;I am committed to taking further actions to bring inflation back down to our goal,&#8221; she stressed.</p>
<p>The Fed governor explained that the FOMC has been tightening monetary policy since last March &#8220;through a combination of increasing the federal funds rate by 4-1/4 percentage points and reducing our balance sheet holdings.&#8221;</p>
<p>While noting, &#8220;we&#8217;ve seen a decline in some measures of inflation&#8221; in recent months, Bowman emphasized:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have a lot more work to do, so I expect the FOMC will continue raising interest rates to tighten monetary policy.</p></blockquote>

However, he insisted that there are &#8220;storm clouds&#8221; that &#8220;could be a hurricane.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon on US Economy</h2>
<p>The chief executive of global investment bank JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, discussed the U.S. economy in an interview with Fox Business Tuesday.</p>
<p>Regarding his previous warning about an incoming <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-warns-of-incoming-economic-hurricane-says-you-better-brace-yourself/">economic hurricane</a> that everybody should brace for, Dimon said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I shouldn&#8217;t ever use the word hurricane.</p></blockquote>
<p>He clarified: &#8220;What I said was there were storm clouds which may mitigate, and people said, &#8216;Oh, he doesn’t think it’s a big deal.&#8217; So I said, &#8216;No, those storm clouds could be a hurricane.'&#8221;</p>
<p>The JPMorgan boss emphasized that he is not predicting a specific scenario, adding that what he is warning about could &#8220;be nothing&#8221; or &#8220;could be bad.&#8221; He stated: &#8220;I think we should understand that I’m not predicting one or the other, I’m just saying, be a little prepared for both of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite the current uncertain economic environment, Dimon is still optimistic about the American consumer. &#8220;The consumer is still strong,&#8221; he described. &#8220;Their balance sheets are in good shape. They&#8217;re spending 10% more than pre-Covid. They have more in their checking account companies that are in good shape, and that&#8217;s driving a strong economy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Regarding the oil crisis, the JPMorgan boss said: &#8220;It&#8217;s heightened because of Russia, Ukraine, oil, energy, food, quantitative tightening.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commenting on the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, the executive opined:</p>
<blockquote><p>Is it going to be enough to raise rates to 5%? And this is having a huge effect on smaller countries, poor nations, those who are reliant on importing oil and gas.</p></blockquote>
<p>Those uncertainties &#8220;may very well mitigate,&#8221; resulting in a &#8220;kind of Goldilocks mild recession,&#8221; he added. &#8220;But they may not,&#8221; he also cautioned. &#8220;So, I&#8217;m still on the cautious side of this one.&#8221; In October last year, Dimon said a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-warns-recession-could-hit-in-6-months-stock-market-could-drop-20-more-this-is-serious-stuff/">recession</a> could hit in six months. In August, he said something <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-boss-jamie-dimon-warns-something-worse-than-a-recession-could-be-coming/">worse</a> than a recession could be coming.</p>

According to statements made by the former rapporteur of the law, Expedito Netto, the new government will likely review the law to include some issues that were left behind for its approval.</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Brazilian Crypto Law Still Not Final, Former Rapporteur States</h2>
<p>The recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/president-of-brazil-sanctions-cryptocurrency-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sanctioned</a> Brazilian cryptocurrency law will likely be reviewed by the newly appointed congress of the country, according to <a href="https://livecoins.com.br/governo-lula-rever-lei-criptomoedas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statements</a> made by its former rapporteur, deputy Expeditto Netto. Netto explained that the changes proposed in the law are not definitive yet, as the project might go into discussion once again to review some of the issues left behind for the sake of its approval.</p>
<p>For Netto, who was not chosen as a deputy again in the general ballot that was held last year, there are still key issues that need to be discussed and included in the law. One of these was whether to force virtual assets service providers to segregate user funds from their own funds or not. The issue was finally left out, as analysts explained that forcing this on companies in the sector could affect the products they could offer due to capital constraints.</p>
<p>However, there is international pressure for constraints of this kind to be exerted on cryptocurrency exchanges after what happened with FTX, one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, when it filed for bankruptcy in November.</p>
<p>Other less controversial topics were also left out, like tax discounts for green mining operations.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Benefits of the Law</h2>
<p>The law does <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cryptocurrency-law-approved-in-brazil-green-mining-tax-exemptions-and-asset-segregation-issues-left-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bring</a> changes that, according to analysts, will be able to help customers feel more secure while investing in cryptocurrency assets. The Central Bank of Brazil became the organization in charge of monitoring and registering exchanges and custody institutions in the country. Also, the legislation gives room for the Brazilian Securities Commission (CVM) to intervene in portfolio offerings coming from these exchanges, restricting the ones considered illegal.</p>
<p>Another touted benefit of the law is that it aims to directly criminalize cryptocurrency scams, establishing penalties for the people behind them.</p>
<p>However, experts have expressed their dissatisfaction with the state in which the law was approved, saying that while this is indeed a good start, there needs to be additional regulation to extend what has already been established in the law.</p>

Founder and CEO of Ava Labs, Emin Gün Sirer, said the collaboration was a &#8220;big deal&#8221; and, in comparison with other blockchain announcements that involved AWS, he insisted that this partnership is &#8220;meaningful.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Founder and CEO of Ava Labs, Emin Gün Sirer, Comments on Collaboration with Amazon Web Services</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.avalabs.org/">Ava Labs</a>, the company behind the blockchain network Avalanche (AVAX), the firm has partnered with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/?nc2=h_lg">Amazon Web Services</a> (AWS) to &#8220;accelerate enterprise, institutional, and government adoption of blockchain.&#8221; The team <a href="https://medium.com/avalancheavax/ava-labs-and-aws-bring-scalable-blockchain-solutions-to-enterprises-and-governments-295040a34263">published</a> the announcement on Jan. 11, 2023, and said that AWS will support the Avalanche network and decentralized application (dapp) ecosystem. &#8220;Critically, Avalanche node operators can run in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/?whats-new-ess.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&amp;whats-new-ess.sort-order=desc">AWS Govcloud</a> for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/fedramp/">Fedramp</a> compliance use cases &#8211; a vital capability and a pre-requisite for enterprises and governments,&#8221; the Wednesday announcement detailed.</p>
<p>“At AWS, we are all about bringing the most cutting-edge technologies to builders, no matter if they sit in a multi-million-dollar enterprise, a government office, or a dorm,” Howard Wright, the VP and global head of AWS startups said in a statement. “The new capabilities brought by Avalanche enable us to do just that. We’re thrilled to add an innovator like Ava Labs to our partner network and to support new tooling for Avalanche’s infrastructure and ecosystem, helping to expand its adoption to new geographies and customer segments.”</p>
<p>The founder and CEO of Ava Labs, <a href="https://twitter.com/el33th4xor">Emin Gün Sirer</a>, commented on the announcement Wednesday afternoon Eastern Time. “This is a big deal,” Gün Sirer <a href="https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1613240492392603665?s=20&amp;t=Sdj044UbRJZWzNLQUm4grg">tweeted</a>. “It&#8217;s not your grandfather&#8217;s ‘AWS partnership announcement.’ Let me explain in plain English. In the past, other chains have paid AWS to host some nodes, and [have] pitched this as ‘AWS partners with Some Chain.’ In reality, ‘Some Chain’ was paying AWS — they were a client of AWS. There was no meaningful partnership.”</p>
<p>The Ava Labs executive <a href="https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1613240495878070279?s=20&amp;t=Sdj044UbRJZWzNLQUm4grg">continued</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This announcement is the exact opposite. AWS recognizes how blockchains are evolving, with subnets serving as appchains, and wants to be one of the hosting providers for the many subnets that people are about to launch.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/AVAX/">Avalanche&#8217;s native token AVAX</a> jumped following the news, rising 16.2% higher against the U.S. dollar. Seven-day statistics show that AVAX is up 29.1%, and the crypto asset&#8217;s market capitalization today is the 19th largest. AVAX is trading for prices between $12.31 to $14.83 per unit during the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>AVAX&#8217;s crypto market capitalization is at $4.51 billion at 4 p.m. Eastern Time on Jan. 11, 2023. Despite the swift rise on Wednesday afternoon following the AWS announcement, AVAX is still down 89% from the $144.96 all-time high on Nov. 21, 2021. Like <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/SOL/">solana (SOL)</a>, avalanche (<a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/AVAX/">AVAX</a>) has taken a big hit during the crypto winter, and as AVAX was once a top-ten cryptocurrency contender, it&#8217;s been struggling to hold a position below the 20th-place threshold.</p>

<h2>Game of Thrones Fans Embrace New NFT Experience, Despite Criticism Over Character Design</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Game of Thrones (GoT) is a popular fantasy television series adapted from George R. R. Martin&#x2019;s series of novels &#x201C;A Song of Ice and Fire,&#x201D; and on Jan. 10, 2023, the show&#x2019;s first NFTs were released. The &#x201C;Game of Thrones: Build Your Realm Hero Box&#x201D; NFT collection sold out on the <a href="https://niftys.com/">Nifty&#x2019;s market</a> in roughly seven hours on Tuesday afternoon Eastern Time. The collection saw a pre-sale of approximately 3,450 Hero Boxes and 1,500 Hero Boxes were sold to the public after the pre-sale finished.&#13;<br />

&#13;<br />
The boxes contained story card non-fungible tokens (NFTs), resource card collectibles, and a single &#x201C;Game of Thrones&#x201D; (GoT) Hero Avatar NFT. GoT NFTs are seeing secondary market action on OpenSea, as Hero Boxes and Hero Avatars are being sold for Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>). &#x201C;The Game of Thrones experience has been a long time coming,&#x201D; the CEO and co-founder of Nifty&#x2019;s, Jeff Marsilio, <a href="https://chainwire.org/2022/12/21/warner-bros-and-niftys-partner-to-launch-game-of-thrones-build-your-realm-digital-collectible-experience/amp/">said</a> in a statement about the project. Marsilio continued:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>Our teams have diligently worked together to create an interactive collecting experience for Game of Thrones fans to continue their journey and live within the beloved series. We are thrilled to introduce more fanatics into the digital collectibles and Web3 industry.</p></blockquote>

Some people <a href="https://twitter.com/bryanbrinkman/status/1612959131123740672?s=20&t=tGbEkxP3seMLMZexCqmOrg">referred</a> to the GoT characters&#x2019; hands as &#x201C;salad fingers&#x201D; on Twitter.&#13;<br />

<h2>Ethereum&#x2019;s Market Share Grows Amid Frenzied Surge in the Cryptocurrency Markets</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
<a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH/">Ethereum (ETH)</a>, the second-leading crypto market asset by market capitalization, has seen an increase in its market dominance over the past 11 days. <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> has managed to gain against the U.S. dollar, climbing approximately 0.48% during the last day. Seven-day metrics show ethereum has risen 6.55% against the greenback.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-568195 size-full" title="Ethereum's Dominance on the Rise: Market Share Increases by 3% Among Global Crypto Assets" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ff-1.jpg" alt="Ethereum's Dominance on the Rise: Market Share Increases by 3% Among Global Crypto Assets" width="1280" height="150" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ff-1-300x35.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ff-1-1024x120.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ff-1-768x90.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ff-1.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px">&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
For ethereum and all other crypto assets, market dominance is calculated by dividing the market capitalization of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> by the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. As of Dec. 31, 2022, coinmarketcap.com (CMC) metrics <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221231191607/https://coinmarketcap.com/">archived</a> on archive.org indicate that <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH/">ethereum (ETH)</a> had a market dominance rating of around 18.4% and the overall crypto economy was valued at $796.91 billion.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com">Data</a> from Jan. 11, 2023, indicates <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>&#x2019;s dominance is now at 19% among the 22,261 crypto assets listed on CMC, which are valued at roughly $856 billion. According to coingecko.com (CG), on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221231101755/https://www.coingecko.com/">Dec. 31, 2022</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>&#x2019;s dominance was around 17.4% and the overall crypto economy was worth $828 billion. It is important to note that CG&#x2019;s metrics are different than CMC&#x2019;s, currently, CG shows <a href="https://www.coingecko.com">ethereum&#x2019;s dominance is at 18%</a>. CMC shows ethereum&#x2019;s (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) dominance rating has increased by 3.26%, and according to CG, the increase was by 3.44%.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Both coin market cap aggregation websites show that <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> dominance has decreased. CMC metrics indicate <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s dominance dipped from 40% to 39.2% over the past 11 days. While CG statistics show <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s dominance rating on that website was 38.5% and it is now at 37.6% on Jan. 11, 2023. Ethereum&#x2019;s market dominance has seen a steady increase in recent days as both crypto market aggregation websites show this is the case. The trend of decreasing dominance of <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin</a> is also consistent in the data provided by both websites.&#13;<br />

Since Jan. 9, 2023, FTT has risen 28.42% and currently sits above the $1 range, following a dip below that threshold.</strong></p>
<h2>FTT Token Jumps 28% Rising Above the $1 Threshold</h2>
<p>The value of FTX&#8217;s exchange token, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ftx-token">FTT</a>, has seen a marked increase over the past two days. On Jan. 9, 2023, the coin reached $1.36 per unit. While some of those gains have been lost, FTT is currently holding above the $1 range at $1.22 per coin as of 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time on Jan. 11, 2023. The reason for this surge in value is uncertain, as FTT&#8217;s tokenomics are tied to the now-defunct FTX exchange and its potential future growth.</p>
<p>FTT&#8217;s <a href="https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/ftx-token/richlist/">levels of ownership concentration</a> are extremely high, with a single address controlling 59.55% of the entire FTT supply. Additionally, an unknown hacker holds 45.85 million FTT tokens, comprising 13.94% of the circulating supply. Another unknown address holds 10 million FTT, or 3.04% of the total supply. FTT&#8217;s value fell below the $1 range on Dec. 19, 2022, and remained below that threshold until a spike on Jan. 9, 2023.</p>
<p>The most active crypto exchanges trading FTT currently include Binance, Mexc Global, Kucoin, Gate.io, and Sushiswap. On Sushiswap alone, there is roughly $104,496 in FTT trades paired against wrapped ethereum (WETH). The overall global trading volume for FTT is approximately $23.81 million among all exchanges worldwide. Since the FTT token&#8217;s all-time low 12 days ago on Dec. 30, 2022, when it reached $0.827 per unit, it has risen 45.8%. However, it remains 98.6% down from its all-time high of $84.18 per unit reached on Sept. 09, 2021.</p>
<p>With Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftx-co-founder-indicted-by-federal-grand-jury-in-manhattan-bahamian-magistrate-denies-sbfs-bail/">facing charges</a> of financial fraud and FTX filing for bankruptcy, the future of FTT is uncertain. Despite this, the token has not experienced the same sharp decline as Terra&#8217;s LUNA did last May. FTT&#8217;s tokenomics were closely tied to those of FTX, including providing traders with reduced fees on the now-defunct crypto exchange, and now the coin&#8217;s tokenomics are in disarray.</p>
<p>FTT is among many crypto assets that have managed to survive despite a lack of development or clear tokenomics. It has now become something for traders to speculate on as a hobby, and in light of the ongoing scandal involving SBF and FTX, it is difficult to view it seriously.</p>

Xrp was also mostly in the green in today&#x2019;s session, extending recent gains in the process. The global crypto market cap is trading 0.17% higher as of writing.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Cosmos (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ATOM" target="_blank">ATOM</a>)</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Cosmos (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ATOM" target="_blank">ATOM</a>) raced to a two-month high on Wednesday, as the token climbed to its strongest point since November.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Following a low of $11.10, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ATOM" target="_blank">ATOM</a>/USD raced to a peak of $11.44 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As a result of this latest surge in price, cosmos moved to its highest point since Nov. 12.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Looking at the chart, today&#x2019;s rally occurred as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) ventured deeper into overbought territory.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In addition to this, the 10-day (red) moving average (MA), continued its upward ascent versus the 25-day (blue) MA.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
However, sentiment could soon be shifting, with bears looking to re-enter the market as the RSI is now tracking at a level not seen since last January.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a></h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> (formerly ripple) was another big mover in today&#x2019;s session, extending recent gains to a fourth consecutive day.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
So far on Thursday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>/USD has risen to an intraday high of $0.3691, which comes less than a day after hitting a bottom of $0.348.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Following this rally, xrp neared a four-week high, as prices moved to their highest point since December 16.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
This latest price surge comes as the RSI moved beyond a resistance point at 57.00, and it is currently tracking at 59.41.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As a result of this move, the 10-day (red) moving average is now close to a crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Should this upwards cross occur, it is likely that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> will continue to move towards its long-term target of $0.40.&#13;<br />

The letter, issued Tuesday by Winklevoss, calls for the DCG board to force Silbert to step down as CEO. Silbert shared his letter on Twitter and said he had been reflecting deeply over the past year on the state of the cryptocurrency industry and its direction.</strong></p>
<h2>Digital Currency Group CEO Barry Silbert Releases Shareholders Letter</h2>
<p>On Tuesday, Digital Currency Group CEO Barry Silbert <a href="https://dcgupdate.com/">wrote a letter</a> to shareholders in response to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/gemini-co-founder-accuses-digital-currency-group-of-misrepresentation-demands-ceo-resignation/">accusations</a> made by Gemini CEO Cameron Winklevoss. Winklevoss had previously accused DCG of misrepresentation and called for Silbert&#8217;s resignation as CEO. Silbert&#8217;s letter, which does not directly address some of Winklevoss&#8217; specific allegations, does include a Q&amp;A session that addresses certain matters.</p>
<p>&#8220;I’ve been reflecting quite a bit about the past year, the state of the industry, and where things go from here,” Silbert <a href="https://twitter.com/BarrySilbert/status/1612890612507807753?s=20&amp;t=6C9K_CA_ma3fCYRoiLG1Xw">wrote</a> on Twitter sharing his letter.</p>
<p>The shareholder letter starts off by expressing pride in the role that the company and Silbert have played in the past ten years as builders in the blockchain industry. Silbert said that DCG has invested in more than 200 firms and in the early days of the industry, the company faced many difficulties and hurdles. The letter then shifts to discuss the challenges faced by the company in the past year. Silbert said bad actors and repeated blow-ups have wreaked havoc on the industry, and the company has faced difficulties as a result.</p>
<p>“Although DCG, our subsidiaries, and many of our portfolio companies are not immune to the effects of the present turmoil, it has been challenging to have my integrity and good intentions questioned after spending a decade pouring everything into this company and the space with an unrelenting focus on doing things the right way,” Silbert wrote.</p>
<p>The Q&amp;A part of Silbert’s letter goes on to explain how DCG interacts with its wholly-owned subsidiaries and portfolio companies. The letter stresses that DCG subsidiaries are independent companies with their own management teams. The company details that this includes financial and risk management protocols, and legal and compliance oversight. One of the questions asks whether or not DCG and its subsidiaries commingle cash.</p>
<p>“No,” the Q&amp;A part of the letter insists. “Each of DCG’s wholly-owned subsidiaries has its own bank accounts, securities accounts, and crypto accounts, and maintains separate books and records.”</p>
<p>The Q&amp;A part further notes that DCG’s relationship with FTX was a $250K Series B investment in 2021 and an FTX trading account “with less than 1% of all our trading volume transacted on that platform.” “Barry has no personal or professional relationship with Sam Bankman-Fried,” the letter stresses. “Aside from a conversation in the Summer of 2022 and a few emails at the time, Barry does not recall ever meeting, speaking with, or otherwise privately communicating with him.”</p>
<h2>DCG&#8217;s Alleged Relationship with Three Arrows Capital and Genesis Capital Explained in Q&amp;A Session, Gemini Terminates Earn Program</h2>
<p>The Q&amp;A section of the letter also addresses alleged ties between Digital Currency Group (DCG) and Three Arrows Capital (3AC), the now-defunct cryptocurrency hedge fund. The letter asserts that &#8220;DCG has never had a relationship with Three Arrows Capital&#8221; and that Barry Silbert, CEO, has never met the 3AC executives. However, Silbert acknowledged that there had been an &#8220;introductory call with one of the co-founders in 2020.&#8221; Additionally, while Genesis Capital, a subsidiary of DCG, had a trading and lending relationship with 3AC, and 3AC defaulted on its loans from Genesis, DCG stated that it &#8220;never coordinated purchases or sales of GBTC or any other investments&#8221; with the bankrupt crypto hedge fund.</p>
<p>The letter also addresses the reasons behind DCG’s decision to take on the bankruptcy claim against 3AC and what DCG received in exchange for the $1.1 billion promissory note from Genesis Capital. According to DCG, the recovery is &#8220;highly uncertain&#8221; and the company &#8220;did not receive any cash, cryptocurrency, or other forms of payment for the promissory note &#8211; DCG effectively assumed Genesis&#8217; risk of loss on the Three Arrows Capital loan with no obligation to do so,&#8221; the company explained in a Q&amp;A section of the letter. Even though it is uncertain what may happen in the near future between DCG and Gemini, Silbert remains optimistic.</p>
<p>Following Silbert&#8217;s shareholder letter, Gemini sent out emails to Earn customers, notifying them that the service was officially terminated. &#8220;We are writing to let you know that Gemini, acting as agent on your behalf, has terminated the Master Loan Agreement (MLA) between you and Genesis Global Capital, LLC (Genesis), effective as of January 8, 2023,&#8221; the email from Gemini said. &#8220;This officially terminates the Earn Program and requires Genesis to return all assets outstanding in the program,&#8221; according to the email. &#8220;Existing redemption requests are not impacted and continue to await fulfillment by Genesis,&#8221; Gemini added.</p>
