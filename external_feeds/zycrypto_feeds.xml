<p>The crypto community is closely monitoring the likelihood of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving a spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) in 2023, even as more institutions continue to apply for the product.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with prominent crypto media journalist Andrew Throuvalass, pro-Bitcoin lawyer Joe Carlasare shared his expert insights on the matter, projecting the likelihood of approval to be in the range of 30% to 40%. Carlasare highlighted two of the most prominent institutions to apply for a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/secs-refusal-to-approve-a-spot-bitcoin-etf-makes-it-a-failed-regulator-says-geminis-cameron-winklevoss/">Bitcoin spot ETF</a> in his analysis, including BlackRock and Grayscale. </p>



<p>BlackRock, a leading investment management corporation, recently confirmed its collaboration with Coinbase, the largest spot Bitcoin exchange in the United States, in its renewed application for a Bitcoin spot ETF. However, despite Coinbase&#8217;s prominence, Carlasare raised concerns that the SEC may question whether it represents a &#8220;sufficient size&#8221; market for establishing an ETF.</p>



<p>Given that a significant portion of spot trading volume occurs outside the U.S., the collaboration with Coinbase may not meet the SEC&#8217;s requirements.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Sufficient size is somewhat ambiguous, but they have said it has to be a market large enough so that a person or firm attempting to manipulate the Bitcoin spot market would need to necessarily trade on that platform,&#8221;</em> said the Illinois-based lawyer.</p>



<p>Carlasare then highlighted the lawsuit filed in 2022 by Grayscale against the SEC over the denial of an application to convert Grayscale&#8217;s Bitcoin Trust to an ETF. He emphasized that even if Grayscale wins its ongoing lawsuit, it does not guarantee the conversion into a spot ETF.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>&#8220;A &#8216;win&#8217; may just mean the court of appeals directs the SEC to revisit their decision,&#8221;</em> he said, adding, however, that while a favourable outcome in the lawsuit could prompt the SEC to reconsider, the ultimate approval of a spot ETF remains uncertain.</p>



<p>Carlasare&#8217;s predictions come just days after Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg&#8217;s senior ETF strategist, estimated a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/theres-a-50-chance-blackrocks-spot-bitcoin-etf-gets-greenlight-from-sec-top-bloomberg-analyst-predicts/">50% probability</a> of BlackRock&#8217;s spot Bitcoin ETF receiving approval from the SEC primarily due to the increased likelihood of Grayscale prevailing in their ongoing lawsuit against the SEC.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, Brokerage firm Bernstein released a report on Monday indicating a &#8220;relatively high&#8221; probability of approval for a Bitcoin spot ETF. According to the report, the SEC could approve the product based on its prior approval of futures-based Bitcoin ETFs and leverage-based futures ETFs. However, it emphasized that the SEC may demand regulatory oversight of spot ETFs from exchanges within its purview, such as the CME, rather than Coinbase.</p>



<p>SEC&#8217;s cautious approach to cryptocurrencies stems from concerns about market manipulation, investor protection, and the overall stability of the cryptocurrency market. As a result, it has denied several Bitcoin ETF applications in the past due to what it perceives as insufficient information and inadequate safeguards. Nevertheless, industry players have been fighting back, with firms like BlackRock, Invesco and Wisdom Tree reapplying for the product.</p>

<p>Bitcoin kicked off the week with a stable trading range on Monday, maintaining its position within a key resistance area of $30,870 and finding support at $29,700.</p>



<p>This comes after the cryptocurrency reached a yearly high of $31,384 approximately two weeks ago. Since June 23, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/analyst-reveals-what-market-conditions-could-supercharge-bitcoin-price-to-310000/">Bitcoin</a> has been trading sideways, displaying a consolidated pattern as it navigates the abovementioned resistance and support levels.</p>



<p>Notably, Bitcoin has witnessed a significant trend amid its sideways movement. According to Cryptoquant, there has been an 80% decline in addresses sending their coins to crypto exchanges over 612 days. Additionally, since March 2020, Bitcoin reserves on exchanges have dropped by over 30%, marking the first consistent period of decreasing supply in Bitcoin&#8217;s history.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;This suggests an enduring and positive evolution in the general perception of Bitcoin, especially when coupled with BlackRock and other ETFs recently filed/re-filed and some of the upcoming regulatory frameworks being introduced among leading markets, particularly the G20. Retail traders and institutions are holding more Bitcoin than ever,&#8221;</em> wrote Cryptoquant.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/I4ZiUADDRVRE5uqabB89vxA4PG2jkA2HTX2Vex_CHYnuu0WQmqnagiw6_QaEejdk7r9mtOAMAWNM0DitoaR2Gnqxmk3Q_sgsToPc2Emwhzci6gOHOkS7ph9ZjHlxKifUpsk8Q1RWvYhm1wLLx-TQ1Q" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Institutional investors have also continued accumulating Bitcoin, as noted by &#8220;Tarek Onchain,&#8221; an analyst for Cryptoquant. In a note on Monday, Tarek observed a significant upward trend in the accumulation of BTC by institutional entities, demonstrating a strong interest in acquiring the cryptocurrency at its current price level.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;By closely observing fund holdings, we can identify a significant upward trend in the accumulation of bitcoins by these institutional entities. This exponential increase in holdings indicates a strong interest to acquire Bitcoin, even at its current price level,&#8221;</em> said Tarek.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Historically, institutional investors are known to demonstrate a patient approach, seeking long-term investment opportunities in Bitcoin, which is good for price.</p>



<p>That said, from a technical point of view, Diana, a CFA financial analyst, wrote on Monday that bulls appear hesitant to take profits at current prices, which indicates their optimistic outlook for further price gains. In her <a href="https://twitter.com/Forex__XAUUSD/status/1675753053780324354">analysis</a>, Diana argued that if Bitcoin manages to break and sustain its position above $31,000, it could potentially initiate the next phase of its upward trend, with a target of $40,000.</p>



<p><em>“Buyers must push and sustain the price above the $31,431 mark to signal a resumption of upward momentum,”</em> she added.</p>



<p>Conversely, the pundit mentioned that for the Bears to make a comeback, they would need to drive the price down and maintain it below $27,622.</p>



<p>That said, amid a cautious market sentiment prevailing during the current consolidation period, traders and investors eagerly await a breakthrough above resistance or below support levels, setting the stage for the next substantial price movement. Notably, resilient demand amidst declining exchange inflows and continued institutional accumulation paint a promising future for Bitcoin, hinting at potential upward momentum shortly.</p>



<p>At press time, Bitcoin traded at $30,425 after a 1.99% decline in the past 24 hours. </p>

<p>Arrington Capital, a prominent Washington-based digital asset management firm, has recently taken a significant step towards launching an XRP-based hedge fund.</p>



<p>The news of this development was initially disclosed on Twitter by U.S. presidential candidate and CEO of Reaper Financial Patrick Riley on July 2. In his tweet, Riley mentioned that Arrington Capital had recently submitted a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an XRP-focused hedge fund, indicating a positive outlook for the endeavour. </p>



<p><em>&#8220;Arrington recently filed with the SEC for an XRP-based hedge fund. Seems there is an expectation for all to go well&#8230;&#8221;</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/PLR_2024/status/1675296576368001025">tweeted</a> Riley sharing a photo of Michael Arrington, the founder of Arrington Capital, alongside Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple. According to documents perused by ZyCrypto, the filing was made on June 30, 2023.</p>



<p>The said filing elicited excitement among the crypto community, with Pro-Ripple lawyer John Deaton jokingly tweeting, <em>&#8220;What do you do when the SEC has spent well over a $100M in manpower and resources the last three years arguing XRP is an illegal security? You apply for an XRP Hedge Fund.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Hedge funds are investment vehicles or firms that pool capital from accredited individuals or institutional investors to invest in a variety of assets to generate returns. They are known for their flexibility in investing across different markets and asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, commodities, and cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>While specifics regarding the hedge fund are scarce at the moment, Riley&#8217;s announcement suggests that Arrington Capital holds an optimistic view of the potential outcome of the Ripple-SEC case, prompting them to create a hedge fund centered around XRP. Arrington Capital has established two additional funds focused on the Algorand and Moonbeam ecosystems, along with a diverse portfolio of over eighty investments spanning various protocols.</p>



<p>Arrington Capital&#8217;s recent action holds substantial significance for Ripple and XRP, particularly in light of the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-continues-to-see-new-twists-and-turns-as-alderoty-reveals-ripples-benefits-in-sec-case/">SEC&#8217;s ongoing lawsuit</a> brought against Ripple. The lawsuit, initiated in December 2020, alleges that XRP, currently the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is unregistered security. With all necessary motions filed, the case has been awaiting a summary judgment from Judge Analisa Torres, who presides over the matter.</p>



<p>While the conclusion of the Ripple-SEC case remains uncertain, attorneys, including prominent figures like John Deaton, have been actively offering their predictions on the possible outcomes of this legal battle. Notably, the possibility of an <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-lawsuit-crypto-lawyer-sheds-light-on-imminent-judgment-in-sec-case-as-xrp-army-awaits-verdict/">imminent judgment</a> in the Ripple-SEC case has sparked extensive speculation, particularly after recent remarks from the Ripple CEO suggesting it could arrive within weeks. </p>

<p>Cardano (ADA) has experienced a relatively flat trading pattern since last October, lacking significant <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ada-eyes-explosive-adoption-as-49-billion-telecom-giant-vodafone-chooses-cardano-for-first-nft-drop/">upward momentum</a>. The seventh-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is currently down approximately 92% from its all-time high of $3.</p>



<p>However, ADA&#8217;s recent price behaviour has shown some signs of recovery. After hitting a low of $0.22 earlier last month, it has since rebounded by around 33%, with experts now predicting a potential surge in its price in the coming months.</p>



<p>According to popular crypto analyst Alan Santana, the focus should be on the long-term perspective when evaluating ADA&#8217;s potential. In a recent analysis on Tradingview, Santana highlighted a pattern sequence consisting of three stages that could drive ADA&#8217;s price during the upcoming bull market. The pundit opined that the first two stages have already been completed, with the third stage expected to follow.</p>



<p>Santana&#8217;s analysis pointed to potential price targets once the bull market resumes. He predicted that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/charles-hoskinson-highlights-cardanos-growing-adoption-amidst-lots-of-noise-in-crypto/">Cardano</a> could reach $0.665 this year and potentially even surge as high as $1.34. In the long term, Santana anticipated targets of $2 and $2.5. Moreover, he mentioned the possibility of ADA reaching new all-time highs, indicating potential levels of $4.9 and $7.77, with the potential for even higher prices in the future.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/hPVunKXh0nDc_tZAkvUDWj9XDqDiWnJa2nQMDS33LpkYlrPaXlT4z2FiX4EFN8plX6t0zuje6cQbAFBQs4k1ZoXCPBJ65NPtQw_74JG6DlcvpBBgwNKCjcMPqn1cOVhmF1-8DfasxF_RU4V27GETlQ" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Another analyst, Dan Gambardello, also shared his insights on Cardano&#8217;s price movement, observing various indicators that suggest ADA may continue its upward momentum. In a July 4 video, the analyst emphasized the importance of ADA breaking through the $0.32 key resistance level, which coincides with the 0.618 Fibonacci resistance and the 50-day moving average.</p>



<p>He noted that ADA had exhibited higher highs and lows, indicative of upward momentum. Examining ADA&#8217;s weekly chart, he pointed out a higher low on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) from a previous swing low, which coincided with the bear market low in December 2022. He says this bullish divergence on the weekly chart suggests a positive outlook for ADA.</p>



<p>The analyst further attributed ADA&#8217;s oversold condition to the recent news surrounding the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and acknowledged that other cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, have different chart patterns than ADA. However, he emphasized that ADA has significant ground to cover to catch up with its counterparts.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, Cardano&#8217;s ecosystem has continued to thrive, further supporting predictions for price growth. Notably, the DeFi sector has experienced exponential growth, witnessing a remarkable surge of over 148% in Total Value Locked (TVL) during the first half of 2023. Moreover, the number of projects being developed on the network reached a new high last month, with a total of 1261 projects now building and an impressive 131 projects already being launched.</p>



<p>ADA was trading at $0.2936 at press time, up 1.18% in the past day and just over 5% in the past week.</p>

<ul>
<li>Bitcoin could surpass its one-year high after finishing June on a positive note.</li>



<li>Experts say the decline in liquidity has the potential to result in an upward trend, as on-chain metrics indicate bullishness.</li>



<li>The chatter about a spot Bitcoin ETF has contributed its fair share to a surge in the asset’s price over the last 24 hours.</li>
</ul>



<p>As the U.S. celebrates Independence Day, Bitcoin (BTC) bulls are rubbing their hands in glee at the prospects of the asset surpassing its 52-week high.</p>



<p>Onchain analytics indicate a cooling of the virtual currency markets ahead of the holidays marked by dwindling levels of liquidity. Despite the falling liquidity metrics, pundits aver that Bitcoin is poised for a rally, building upon an already impressive streak.</p>



<p><em>“Historically liquidity is definitely lower around holidays and combined with a relatively large increase in leverage recently, prices will be more susceptible to sharp movements,”</em> remarked Kyle Doane, an executive at Arca. <em>“The market is still leaning bullish and overall sentiments continue to improve.”</em></p>



<p>At the start of the week, BTC climbed to $31,375 after a strong show of resilience in the face of macroeconomic uncertainties. Pundits are predicting that the asset class will surge past its one-year high of $31,389 over the holidays, but it all hangs in the balance.</p>



<p>Since the start of the year, BTC has climbed by a staggering 80% from lows of around $16,000. Although the current price is still a far cry from the all-time high of $68,789, the steady upward momentum of BTC in 2023 offers a glimmer of hope to investors of the asset class.</p>



<p>Bitcoin’s rise in recent weeks has rubbed off positively on the shares of several digital asset companies in the space, with the stock of U.S,-based exchange, Coinbase climbing by 12% to trade at $79.93. Other firms notching impressive wins in the build-up to the holidays include Marathon Digital, MicroStrategy, and Riot Platforms as they recorded double-digit wins.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bitcoin-etfs-stoking-the-flames"><strong>Bitcoin ETFs stoking the flames</strong></h2>



<p>There has been significant activity around a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), with a clutch of firms amending their <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-etfs-in-motion-an-analysis-of-open-spot-btc-etf-applications-in-the-market/">applications</a> to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>



<p>Under the new amendments, applicants are naming markets to be monitored in a new surveillance-sharing agreement. Fidelity and BlackRock are jostling for the SEC’s approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF with the potential to send the asset class to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-gains-fidelity-re-files-for-spot-bitcoin-etf-amongst-many-is-demand-driving-btc-price/">new highs</a>.</p>



<p>In the weeks following the SEC’s approval for a future-based Bitcoin ETF, the asset class <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-briefly-touches-60000-thanks-to-reports-sec-wont-block-btc-futures-etf-in-the-us/">surged</a> to its peak of $68,789 back in November 2021.</p>

<p>After hitting highs well above $0.55 in Mid-June, the highest for XRP since Late 2022, the price of XRP has been somewhat on the decline. Currently, XRP sits just above 48 cents and is the only top ten coin in the red. A reason for the lacklustre performance may be the ongoing legal battle with the SEC, where a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-lawsuit-crypto-lawyer-sheds-light-on-imminent-judgment-in-sec-case-as-xrp-army-awaits-verdict/">decision by Judge Torres is expected</a> any day now.</p>



<p>However, a <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/citigroup-reviews-partnership-with-crypto-custodian-metaco-1.1939963">report</a> by Bloomberg suggests there could be other reasons for the below-par performance of XRP. According to the report and citing unnamed sources, Citigroup Inc. is presently reevaluating its collaboration with the Swiss fintech firm Metaco to custody digital assets. The collaboration between Citigroup and Metaco was first revealed roughly a year ago.</p>



<p>Ripple Labs, combating the US Securities and Exchange Commission in court for years, had <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-acquires-crypto-custody-provider-metaco-for-250m-as-xrp-lawsuit-nears-end-game/">paid $250 million to acquire Metaco</a>. It&#8217;s unclear whether Ripple&#8217;s purchase of Metaco has anything to do with Citigroup&#8217;s reconsideration of the collaboration. According to Ripple, Metaco will continue to run independently under its current CEO, Adrien Treccani.</p>



<p>Last year, Metaco also established partnerships with BNP Paribas SA and Forge, Societe Generale SA&#8217;s division for digital assets. According to Bloomberg, while BNP Paribas did not comment on the collaboration, Societe Generale confirmed their relationship with Metaco was still active and operational.</p>



<p>Ripple purchased Metaco as part of a strategic drive to diversify the company&#8217;s offerings beyond payments. With the acquisition, Ripple could allow its customers to tokenize, settle, and offer custody services for various assets.</p>



<p>When Ripple took over Metaco in May, CEO Brad Garlinghouse outlined the high hopes the company seemed to have in the acquisition. Garlinghouse said: <em>“Through the strength of our balance sheet and financial position, Ripple will continue pressing our advantage in the areas critical to crypto infrastructure. Bringing on Metaco is monumental for our growing product suite and expanding global footprint</em>.”</p>



<p>Regarding XRP price, whether the news about Citigroup and Metaco will deter investors in the long run, remains to be seen. A decision in the lawsuit may likely serve much more as a catalyst of any price movement, with some pundits expecting solid performance in case of a Ripple win.</p>



<p>However, given the magnitude of the case, many legal commentators seem to have already factored in that no matter how the judge decides, the case will likely come in front of appellate courts and perhaps even as high as the Supreme Court of the United States. In this case, the price of XRP could remain suppressed for an indefinite amount of time.</p>

<p>Shiba Inu, the renowned meme-based cryptocurrency, experienced an astounding 1900% burn rate surge within 24 hours. This remarkable spike came on the heels of the Shibarium testnet, Puppynet, reaching a significant milestone of 25 million total transactions, generating immense excitement and anticipation for the imminent mainnet release.</p>



<p>PuppyScan, the dedicated blockchain explorer for <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-gathers-pace-with-big-metaverse-updates-amid-rocket-pond-reveal-as-0-001-shib-price-beckons/">Shiba Inu</a>, reported that the Shibarium beta testnet had surpassed the impressive mark of 25 million transactions at a staggering 25,507,335. Moreover, 17,001,839 wallet addresses have actively participated in Shiba Inu transactions, highlighting the widespread engagement and interest in this captivating cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>The testnet has processed over 1,483,165 blocks, boasting an impressive average block time of 7.5 seconds. These impressive statistics showcase the efficiency and scalability of the testnet and contribute to the growing optimism surrounding Shiba Inu and the expanding possibilities within its ecosystem.</p>



<p>The excitement further intensified when Shytoshi Kusama, the esteemed lead developer of SHIB, took to Twitter to share a compelling 19-second video clip accompanied by an image featuring the iconic dog-headed SHIB logo. While the video contained minimal captions, it offered a tantalizing glimpse into the project&#8217;s plans. The dynamic motion lettering within the video alluded to an imminent revelation, with the cryptic message, &#8220;Something is coming. Actually, we are going somewhere.&#8221;</p>



<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-unlocks-remarkable-price-trajectory-amid-exciting-ecosystem-updates-for-shibarium/">Shibarium</a>, a cutting-edge Layer 2 blockchain platform, is poised to empower the development of Decentralized Applications (DApps). As the launch of the mainnet approaches, Shiba Inu enthusiasts eagerly anticipate the boundless opportunities and prospects that this innovative platform will unlock.</p>



<p>Regarding price action, Shiba Inu was observed trading at $0.000007722, registering a notable 3% increase in the past 24 hours. While volatility is inherent in the cryptocurrency market, the recent surge in burn rate and the significant milestone achieved by the Shibarium testnet undoubtedly contribute to the prevailing positive sentiment surrounding Shiba Inu amid calls for a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/0-001-shib-price-beckons-as-shiba-inus-shibarium-public-beta-finally-set-to-go-live-this-week/">$0.001 SHIB price</a>.</p>



<p>As the cryptocurrency community eagerly awaits further updates and announcements from the dedicated team behind Shiba Inu, the resounding success of the Shibarium testnet and the growing engagement with Shiba Inu transactions establish a solid foundation for the project&#8217;s future growth and widespread adoption.</p>

<p>Jack Dorsey, the founder and former CEO of Twitter, has urged the current leadership to integrate censorship-resistant protocols to help alleviate the burden of restrictions. This comes just months after billionaire Elon Musk acquired the social media giant and embarked on a journey to transform the platform.</p>



<p>Dorsey <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1675280187704086528">tweeted</a> early Sunday, acknowledging the challenges of running Twitter and expressing hope for the platform&#8217;s success. He further emphasized the importance of building on open protocols like <a href="https://zycrypto.com/secs-refusal-to-approve-a-spot-bitcoin-etf-makes-it-a-failed-regulator-says-geminis-cameron-winklevoss/">Bitcoin</a> and NOSTR to preserve the open internet.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_XwRZf2kieCN-aye4y5GTJFiZpQCkvgl6-5jMWXQx1ypNgutXGbtzBWeXASWDaDAGEKj_rWCpr5rQ6-jZz2kjmOxF_3qQpyKeaavCHe_LXlSSShsrDIF4Tj5gesJU3Hn7ijLpd7WcjtQ8437p_yxLg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>NOSTR is a protocol designed to create a censorship-resistant global social network using simple and flexible event objects and standard elliptic-curve cryptography for keys and signing.</p>



<p>The timing of Dorsey&#8217;s tweet was notable, as it came just minutes before Elon Musk, the new owner of Twitter, announced temporary limits on account activities to address issues of data scraping and system manipulation.</p>



<p>Musk&#8217;s tweet sparked speculation about the platform&#8217;s future direction under his leadership, with various users reporting temporary restrictions to views. In a later tweet, the Tesla boss stated that implementing the rate limit on Twitter was a last resort to prevent competitors from accessing Twitter&#8217;s data. While acknowledging that it is a temporary measure, he assured users that normal Twitter functionality would be restored.</p>



<p>Elon Musk&#8217;s acquisition of Twitter last year was met with anticipation and concern. The $44 billion deal marked a significant moment for the social media service but also raised questions about the platform&#8217;s direction under Musk&#8217;s ownership.</p>



<p>Musk, known for his strong views on free speech, expressed his intention to create a more freewheeling platform, reverse the permanent ban on former President Donald J. Trump and integrate cryptocurrencies such as <a href="https://zycrypto.com/elon-musk-hints-at-integrating-dogecoin-for-millions-of-users-if-he-buys-twitter-or-creates-own-platform/">Dogecoin</a> for payments. Musk&#8217;s ownership of Twitter also promised sweeping changes for the platform, including pledging new leadership, job cuts, and innovative strategies to monetize the service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Critics, however, have been voicing concerns about the potential for increased toxic content and misinformation on Twitter, with the public Square being sued for various alleged violations, including a $250 million copyright case last week by 17 music publishers.</p>



<p>That said, as Elon Musk addresses the challenges faced by Twitter, Dorsey&#8217;s proposition on the integration of Bitcoin and NOSTR holds the potential to revolutionize the platform into a more decentralized and censorship-resistant space, according to some. At press time, however, Musk was yet to respond to the proposition.</p>

<p>In a scathing critique of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, has condemned the regulatory body for its decade-long <a href="https://zycrypto.com/a-non-futures-etf-structure-is-the-superior-approach-says-vaneck-ceo-as-sec-refuses-to-approve-a-bitcoin-spot-fund/">refusal to approve</a> a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).</p>



<p>In a Sunday tweet, the crypto guru claimed that the SEC&#8217;s actions have been detrimental to U.S. investors and demonstrated its failure as a regulator. Winklevoss&#8217;s statement came on the 10th anniversary of his initial filing for the first <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-gains-fidelity-re-files-for-spot-bitcoin-etf-amongst-many-is-demand-driving-btc-price/">spot Bitcoin ETF</a>.</p>



<p>Over the years, the SEC has repeatedly rejected proposals for spot Bitcoin ETFs, denying investors the opportunity to access one of the best-performing assets of the last decade. Winklevoss argued that this refusal had had significant negative consequences, forcing investors into alternative avenues that offer suboptimal options. Specifically, he highlighted the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) as a prime example.</p>



<p>According to him, the SEC is a failed regulator because it <em>“‘protected’ investors from the best-performing asset of the last decade -pushed investors into toxic products like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which trades at a massive discount to NAV and charges astronomical fees.”</em></p>



<p>Moreover, Winklevoss pointed out that the SEC&#8217;s refusal to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs had pushed spot Bitcoin activity offshore, diverting it to unlicensed and unregulated venues. This trend poses potential risks for investors who seek exposure to cryptocurrency but are forced to operate in a less secure environment.</p>



<p>Winklevoss accused the SEC of indirectly leading investors into the arms of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/house-committee-requests-information-on-gary-genslers-interaction-with-sam-bankman-fried-and-ftx/">FTX</a>. This cryptocurrency exchange was embroiled in one of the largest financial frauds in modern history. In his view, by failing to provide a regulated avenue for investors to access Bitcoin through spot ETFs, the SEC inadvertently directed them to less trustworthy platforms, exposing them to more significant risks.</p>



<p>Calling for a reassessment of the SEC&#8217;s approach, Winklevoss suggested that the regulatory body should focus on its core responsibilities of investor protection, fostering fair and orderly markets, and facilitating capital formation. By doing so, the SEC could have achieved far better outcomes for U.S. investors.</p>



<p>This critique from Winklevoss comes in the wake of recent statements by the SEC that ETF filings by BlackRock and others were &#8220;inadequate&#8221;. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has expressed concerns over investor protection, market manipulation, and the need for robust regulatory oversight before greenlighting such products, stating last month that &#8220;<em>There’s nothing about the crypto securities markets that suggests that investors and issuers are less deserving of the protections of our securities laws.”</em></p>



<p>However, Gensler’s assertions have been heavily criticized, with industry players accusing him of overreaching his mandate under U.S. securities laws. Notably, in the past few weeks, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/pro-crypto-lawmakers-officially-introduce-legislation-to-oust-sec-chair-gary-gensler/">calls for his sacking have increased</a>, with pro-crypto congressman Warren Davidson filing a bill last month to reform the SEC and remove the “tyrannical Chairman” Gary Gensler.</p>

<p>In a recent Video for CryptoLawUS, John Deaton, the well-known lawyer and representative of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-could-soar-10x-to-hit-300000-reckons-xrp-holders-lawyer-heres-how/">XRP holders</a> in the SEC vs Ripple lawsuit, discusses the unease of waiting for a final ruling. Deaton recognises that people are making assumptions and expressing annoyance at how long the case has strung.</p>



<p>Drawing on his own experience, Deaton states, “Well, today I was working on a case that was filed in 2018 by me; there&#8217;s like three of these cases. That&#8217;s 2018. It was five years ago. And so, this delay is normal to me <em>because it&#8217;s the civil justice system.”</em></p>



<p>Deaton emphasized the situation&#8217;s complexity by highlighting that Ripple and the SEC made multiple moves for summary judgment in the case&#8217;s reply briefs and objections to one another&#8217;s motions. Additionally, the case is complex and involves hundreds of pages of arguments for the judge to go through.</p>



<p>Six months ago, the response briefs were due; on March 6th, a Daubert motion was also submitted, dealing with expert witnesses&#8217; admissibility. It was highlighted that the judge&#8217;s summary judgment rulings had occurred anywhere from the same day as the Daubert decision to six months subsequently, based on earlier rulings she issued in related instances.</p>



<p>To dispel the myth that this case is taking much longer than her prior ones, it was anticipated that the decision, in this case, could be made by September 6th. The judge is probably taking the time to thoroughly consider her ruling, given the significance of this case and the scrutiny it will receive from numerous parties, including appellate courts.</p>



<p>Regarding the length of the case, the famous lawyer argues that this case, which fills a regulatory gap, is a first impression case because no other cases have addressed secondary sales in this way. Fifteen amicus briefs have also been submitted, underlining the case&#8217;s importance for international trade, finance, and U.S. economic policy.</p>



<p>It should be noted, according to Deaton, that Judge Torres has a wide range of duties and objectives while managing over 500 outstanding cases, including 44 criminal cases. Despite some claims to the contrary, it is critical to acknowledge the importance of each case on the docket, even those involving defendants who face harsh penalties.</p>



<p>Deaton dismisses the idea of anything nefarious occurring in this case as absolute nonsense. While some have argued Judge Torres is on the SEC payroll and that she is doing an inside job, Deaton strongly questions why the Judge would have ruled against the SEC at all then, for example, by ordering them to release the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-references-hinman-emails-in-xrp-case-as-exchange-seeks-dismissal-of-secs-lawsuit/">Hinman emails</a>.</p>



<p><em>“OK, so if she was corrupt and on the SEC&#8217;s payroll, she would have never released the Hinman emails that they fought so desperately to keep private.” </em>He said on the matter.</p>



<p>While Deaton pointed out that he was happy with the appointment of Judge Netburn and Torres, he said that he did not have to agree with every decision they made but that they were fair overall. He cited the exclusion of an SEC witness who claimed to speak for XRP holders yet had never even spoken to one.</p>



<p>He said: <em>“Are you really going to sit there and say oh she just did that to give an appearance that she&#8217;s fair. Come on like let&#8217;s join reality. Get out of the metaverse and let&#8217;s get back into reality. Please. It&#8217;s not.”</em></p>



<p>Finally, Deaton concluded that if the decision is in Ripple&#8217;s favour, the SEC may submit a notice of appeal; if it is in the SEC&#8217;s favour, the SEC may still decide to appeal or negotiate with Ripple.</p>



<p>Given the importance of the case and the likelihood that it will go to the US Supreme Court, the judge would take the much-needed time before making a final ruling, aware that the Second Circuit and other high-ranking judges will be closely examining it.</p>

<p>In a successful operation against cryptocurrency crime, Australian authorities have apprehended two individuals and recovered high-end cars and valuable timepieces following a thorough investigation by the Financial Crimes Squad detectives. </p>



<p>According to a June 22 statement by the New Wales Police, the investigation, conducted by the State Crime Command&#8217;s Financial Crimes Squad, focused on a cryptocurrency hoax that defrauded two companies of over $5.5 million.</p>



<p>Notably, the cryptocurrency scam is reported to have occurred in 2021, prompting the creation of Strike Force Scotland in March 2023. The diligent efforts of the strike force culminated on Friday, June 16, 2023, when detectives intercepted a vehicle on Orlando Road in Cromer, successfully apprehending the 39-year-old driver who was the sole occupant.</p>



<p>Following the arrest, three search warrants were executed at a residence and warehouse in Cromer linked to the suspect, yielding significant findings. These included the seizure of six luxury and classic cars, 11 motorcycles, seven luxury watches, cryptocurrency wallets, and relevant documents associated with the ongoing investigation. The total estimated value of the confiscated vehicles is approximately $2.7 million.</p>



<p>The apprehended individual was charged with dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage through deception and knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime to conceal. On Saturday, June 21, 2023, police discovered and seized a red Ferrari valued at $600,000 from a car dealership in Marrickville, strengthening the case against the accused. They also apprehended a 67-year-old man on the same day and charged him with dealing with the proceeds of crime exceeding $100,000.</p>



<p>As per the statement, the police plan to &#8220;<em>allege in court the younger man allegedly defrauded the companies using a cryptocurrency scam, whilst the older man authorized the funds and arranged the disposal of the Ferrari on behalf of the younger man to avoid police detection.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Confirming the arrests, Detective Superintendent Gordon Arbinja, Commander of the State Crime Command&#8217;s Financial Crimes Squad, issued a timely reminder to exercise caution and due diligence when engaging in cryptocurrency transactions.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Cryptocurrency isn&#8217;t illegal, but it is imperative that it&#8217;s handled responsibly to avoid being scammed</em>,&#8221; said Arbinja&nbsp;</p>



<p>Arbinja further recommended using AUSTRAC-approved digital currency exchanges and thoroughly scrutinizing transaction details during cryptocurrency buying or selling. He also urged individuals who suspect a scam has targeted them to contact ScamWatch and local law enforcement for assistance promptly.</p>



<p>This is not the first time Australian authorities have conducted successful arrests and recovery of assets in prominent cryptocurrency fraud cases. Last December, police apprehended four individuals following a $100 million scam involving fraudulent cryptocurrency and forex investment investments.</p>



<p>That said, the prevalence of investment scams is a global concern, and Australia has not been spared. Recent data compiled by Scamwatch reveals that Australians lost over AU$ 113 million within the initial five months of 2022.</p>

<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing director has recognized the role that Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) could play in increasing financial inclusion and making cross-border payments and remittances cheaper and quicker.</p>



<p>These remarks were made by Kristalina Georgieva, IMF Managing Director, on June 19, 2023, at the High-level Policy Roundtable on Central Bank Digital Currencies while discussing ‘The Role of the Public Sector in Money and Payments – A New Vision’ in Rabat, Morocco.</p>



<p>Georgieva said that though CBDCs could increase efficiencies in cross-border payments, foster competition, and enhance transparency, they could lead to financial stability risks, data privacy, and legal challenges, if poorly designed.</p>



<p>Georgieva further cautioned that easy access to foreign CBDCs could lead to risks of currency substitution and capital flow volatility.</p>



<p>According to Tobias Adrian, Financial Counsellor and Director of the Monetary and Capital Markets Department at the IMF, new technologies, and new legal and regulatory environments will be a hurdle to some but a springboard to others. Adrian said that CBDC platforms would need to be backed by strong legal and regulatory frameworks.</p>



<p>Adrian made the above remarks at the joint IMF—Bank Al-Maghrib High-Level Policy Roundtable on Central Bank Digital Currencies that was discussing Exploring Cross-Border and Domestic Payment and Contracting Platforms, in Rabat, Morocco on June 19, 2023.</p>



<p>Adrian said that CBDC platforms are worth investigating and that individual countries will base on preferences, needs, and policy objectives to decide which CBDC direction to take. Adrian said that several central banks have begun experiments on CBDCs and they are following their work with great interest.</p>



<p>According to the Deputy Managing Director, Bo Li, by the end of February 2023, over 40 countries had approached the IMF to request technical assistance on CBDCs and the IMF had already engaged with almost 30 of the countries.</p>



<p>Li made these remarks at the panel on the IMF Approach to Central Bank Digital Currency Capacity Development on April 12, 2023. Li said CBDCs are likely to have profound implications for monetary policy and financial stability.</p>



<p>Li further said that the IMF will monitor and advise on digital money developments, including CBDCs, for its members. Li said that the IMF’s approach to capacity development on CBDCs aims to help member countries make well-informed decisions when considering designing and issuing CBDCs.</p>



<p>According to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) CBDC survey of 2021, nine out of 10 central banks were exploring CBDCs. Half of the central banks in the BIS survey were developing or running concrete experiments on CBDCs.</p>

<p>Polygon has responded to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) claim that its token is a security governed by the Securities laws. According to a June 11, 2023 tweet, Polygon has advised that its token was developed and deployed outside the United States (U.S.) and never targeted the U.S. market at any time.</p>



<p>In its recent cases against Binance and Coinbase, the SEC named the following cryptocurrencies as securities: BNB, Binance USD, Solana, Cardano, Polygon, ATOM, SAND, MANA, AXS, COTI, Chiliz (CHZ), FLOW, Internet Computer (ICP), NEAR, Voyager Token (VGX), and NEXO.</p>



<p>The SEC Chair, Gary Gensler, has reiterated his earlier position on crypto tokens. According to Gensler, many problems in the crypto markets arise from wide-ranging non-compliance, as witnessed before the federal securities laws were put in place in the 1920s.</p>



<p>Gensler made the remarks before the Piper Sandler Global Exchange &amp; Fintech Conference in Washington, D.C., on June 8, 2023. He further said that most crypto tokens meet the investment contract test, and crypto security issuers must register the offer and sale of their investment contracts with the SEC or seek an exemption.</p>



<p>Gensler further referenced the guidance the SEC has provided market participants on what does or does not constitute a crypto asset security. Gensler pointed out that intermediaries and promoters offer lending or staking-as-a-service programs that promise returns in exchange for investors’ crypto tokens.</p>



<p>However, Gensler says that additional utility does not remove crypto asset security from an investment contract, even when promoters say tokens have functions beyond an investment vehicle.</p>



<p>Gensler said that most crypto tokens are subject to securities laws and that it is immaterial whether the enterprise is speculative or non-speculative or whether there is a sale of property with or without intrinsic value.</p>



<p>In its complaint last week, the SEC alleged that Binance attempted to evade U.S. securities laws to keep high-value U.S. customers on their platforms. Gensler advised crypto intermediaries to separate business lines and properly segregate customer funds to protect investors.</p>



<p>It remains to be seen what next steps the SEC will take against those crypto tokens it has deemed as securities.</p>



<p>However, some of the crypto tokens in question are experiencing high volatility.</p>

<ul>
<li>A newly resurfaced video from 2018 shows Gary Gensler saying&nbsp; BTC, ETH, and LTC are not securities.</li>



<li>Crypto users sharply contrast Gensler’s pro and anti-crypto stance, highlighting significant swings over the years.</li>



<li>In a related development, some United States lawmakers are preparing a bill to reform the SEC and fire Gensler.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has received criticisms over his sudden ideological shift since becoming the Commission’s boss in 2020.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://twitter.com/twobitidiot/status/1668328519334780928?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">video</a> from 2018 featuring Gary Gensler has resurfaced on social media showing him stating clearly that Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Bitcoin Cash are not securities. Several pro-crypto accounts have shared the video describing Gensler as “<em>unstable” </em>in his views as he waged war against digital assets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gensler was addressing institutional investors at an event hosted by Bloomberg and went on to say “<em>Over 70% of the crypto market is Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash. Why did I name those four? They’re not securities.” </em>At the time, Gensler was notably pro-crypto and was a Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he held lectures on blockchain technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two years down the line, he was appointed as the SEC boss with several industry executives and enthusiasts lauding the appointment as the turning point for the industry as inflows began trickling in from institutional investors in 2020. Over the years, the once-sweet experience has turned sour.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The video resurfaced on social media after Gensler launched a new offensive against Binance US and Coinbase with lawsuits making several allegations including fraud and offering its services to unregistered securities. This is not the first of Gensler’s pro-crypto speeches to be circulated accusing him of bias as he now works with the SEC.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-this-is-not-our-gensler">This is not our Gensler&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The new Gary Gensler is not lenient towards digital assets as he was about four years ago. In his defence, many have said as a regulator, he needs to protect investors with everything although they also concede to the fact that his approach is wrong since there’s no clarity of regulation in the market. </p>



<p>Before his appointment to the top job at the SEC, Gensler noted that ETH was not a security but post his appointment, he <a href="https://zycrypto.com/post-merge-concerns-heres-why-eth-could-be-viewed-as-a-security/">suggested</a> that all cryptocurrencies other than BTC could be securities. As SEC chair, he failed to directly answer whether ETH constitutes securities while grilled by Congress leading to more uncertainty.</p>



<p>In a similar video in 2018, Gensler claimed that two-thirds of digital assets are “<em>non-securities</em>&#8216;, but the Commission under his leadership has labelled about 68 digital assets as securities with lawsuits slapped on Binance and Coinbase. In 2019, Gensler referred to Algorand (<em>A</em>LGO) as a “<em>great technology” </em>Forward to 2023, the SEC claims ALGO is a security, a move that has significantly impacted the price of the assets. </p>



<p>The digital asset community remains in shock at the transformation of Gensler, with some calling him a “<em>hypocrite” </em>while pushing for his exit from the SEC.</p>
