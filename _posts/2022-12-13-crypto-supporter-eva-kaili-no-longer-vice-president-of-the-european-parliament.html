Only one person voted against Kaili&#8217;s firing, while two abstained. After the Conference of Presidents started the procedure, the move was unanimously accepted today. &#8220;The Conference of Presidents is shocked and deeply concerned about the recent revelations on corruption and criminal influence [&#8230;]
