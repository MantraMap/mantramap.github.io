<p>In a recent report by Bank of America, the role of Ripple in the payments industry, especially in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, has been hailed by the second-largest bank in the United States. A team of analysts from the bank is unabashedly bullish on the company’s tech.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bank-of-america-endorses-ripple-as-a-possible-exception"><strong>Bank Of America Endorses Ripple As A “Possible Exception”</strong></h2>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://business.bofa.com/content/dam/flagship/global-transaction-services/treasury-innovations-outlook/payments-innovation-in-apac.pdf">report </a>by Bank of America entitled “Breaking New Ground: Harnessing Payments Innovation in APAC”, the bank highlighted the role of blockchain in digitizing trade documents and the potential of Ripple’s frictionless remittance solutions to transform cross-border payments.</p>



<p>Bank of America acknowledges the evolutionary power of technology in enabling real-time payments. According to the bank’s report, APIs are the primary catalysts for the adoption of real-time payments, and they have revolutionized both customer connectivity and transaction processing. </p>



<p>“Banks can save money by utilizing Ripple’s technology, which is one of the reasons cross-border payments through Ripple have become so well-known. By eliminating middlemen and utilizing blockchain technology, Ripple lowers the transaction costs associated with international payments,” said Bank of America.</p>



<p>The bank dubbed Ripple’s work in the cross-border payments space as a “possible exception”, adding that banking institutions can boost the value and competitiveness of their products by passing down the cost-saving benefits to their customers. Moreover, in a highly competitive market, the decrease in operational costs also improves banks&#8217; overall financial health and profitability.</p>



<p>The Head of Treasury Products APAC at Bank of America, Es Venkat, posited: “We’re already seeing Open Banking become a reality in EMEA, with the API mechanism being used to develop many new use cases.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Did XRP’s Future Just Get A Lot Brighter?</strong></h2>



<p>Ripple Labs has, in the past <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-sees-ultra-bullish-use-cases-after-colombias-central-bank-taps-ripple-to-pilot-cbdc/">inked deals </a>with a myriad of financial services providers across the globe. While the recognition by the Bank of America is a big deal, it’s important to note that the majority of financial giants are still not using Ripple’s tech as they are deterred by the company’s legal troubles in the United States. </p>



<p>The San Francisco-based blockchain payments firm has been <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">locked in a courtroom war </a>with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission since 2020 over the allegation it broke federal securities laws by selling the XRP cryptocurrency to retail consumers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If Ripple’s tech achieves widespread adoption after it&#8217;s incorporated into the existing traditional financial infrastructure, it will result in tremendous changes to the global payments ecosystem.  </p>



<p>As for the XRP price, the bears have held off any attempts by the bulls to drive the price of crypto higher despite <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-lawsuit-sec-has-a-3-chance-of-winning-says-lawyer-predicts-xrp-victory-surge-to-10-price/">increasing hopes of a favorable outcome for Ripple</a> in its ongoing SEC lawsuit. The sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap was trading around $0.4674 at publication time, plummeting 0.9% over the last day, per CoinGecko. Whether XRP will embark on a new journey north soon remains anyone&#8217;s guess.</p>

<p>Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes thinks that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/blackrocks-renewed-bitcoin-etf-application-featuring-coinbase-raises-questions-on-secs-scrutiny/">Bitcoin</a> will become the native currency of AI-powered economies and hit over $750,000 in the process. Hayes’s rationale is hinged on the benchmark cryptocurrency’s inherent attributes that could make it interoperable with the fast-growing realm of artificial intelligence.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hayes-calls-btc-the-logical-currency-choice-for-ai"><strong>Hayes Calls BTC The “Logical Currency Choice For AI”</strong></h2>



<p>In his latest intriguing piece titled “Massa”, Arthur Hayes has delved into the potential integration of Bitcoin and artificial intelligence (AI).</p>



<p>According to the Thursday <a href="https://cryptohayes.substack.com/p/massa">blog post</a>, the well-known crypto trader suggested that Bitcoin will ascend as the dominant currency for AI. He argued that the premier crypto’s attributes as a purely digital, censorship-resistant, and digitally scarce currency make it the most fitting choice for AIs.</p>



<p>“Bitcoin is thus the logical currency choice for any AI. It is purely digital, censorship-resistant, provably scarce, and its intrinsic value is completely electricity-cost-dependent. There is nothing in existence today that comes close to challenging Bitcoin on these aspects.”</p>



<p>Hayes added that compared to fiat currencies and gold, which don’t have irrefutable value or quantifiability, Bitcoin&#8217;s immutable supply is programmatically capped at 21 million coins, making it a logical choice for any AI looking for a currency that’s reliable and enshrined with “clear and transparent” rules from the outset.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitcoin’s Road To A $760,000 Price Tag</strong></h2>



<p>Where would a possible convergence between Bitcoin and AI leave the top cryptocurrency?</p>



<p>Hayes predicted that Bitcoin could reach a staggering $760,000 per coin on the back of an AI boost.</p>



<p>“If Bitcoin is seen as likely to be — or even starts to be — used by AIs, then we could see two separate manias combine into one mega mania: the mania of wanting to escape inflation within the fiat financial system and the mania of wanting to own a piece of the next phase of human and computer evolution,” Hayes stated. “The overlap of these two manias would likely drive investors to grossly overpay for growth, causing the value of the Bitcoin network to rise to silly levels.”</p>



<p>Arthur Hayes is no stranger to sky-high price forecasts. In April 2022, the industry stalwart explained how Western financial policy&#8217;s “doom loop” would spark <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cathie-wood-sticks-with-1-million-bitcoin-prediction-amid-maelstrom-of-regulatory-crackdowns-heres-why/">Bitcoin’s run to $1 million</a> by 2030.</p>

<p>The correlation between Bitcoin (BTC) and gold, as well as the traditional market continues to be a burning issue.</p>



<p>According to IntoTheBlock, a shift is being witnessed because the connection between BTC and the traditional market continues to decline.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The market insight provider <a href="https://twitter.com/intotheblock/status/1673595342695301122">stated</a>, <em>“Bitcoin Correlation Shift: A month ago, BTC demonstrated an inverse correlation with the stock market and a minor positive link with Gold. Fast forward to today, it’s intriguing to see BTC showing no connection with traditional markets &amp; a negative correlation with gold.”</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/hsmF61qZWMMStBjhqfAj-8AKb0-4FQMM9OOGlZqZcOAmw7wSeH_HGXdZBmNSVbLatVaipt70hhrNkGo2sT4bt5hxw0q6dvku7o12BdOvkKsSWJNz83m0YWn5x_gOTE9SMC6kMRmmyZw4qaE5uoJfyQ8" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Source:IntoTheBlock</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Glassnode, a leading on-chain metrics provider, shared similar sentiments and acknowledged that Bitcoin’s price action was decoupling from both gold and silver. This was because its 30-day correlation with gold stood at lows of -0.78, whereas that of silver hit -0.9.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/373Q-adF5AiT9sqeTaF2CTgTIBK1PbrDC1c26yUbd12e6GwxMcx6L6HlpncLefw6GbtZieYgtI5IiV6H8KLFVeen12TckCGJxndcdLJ9uPfaNxWMabAuOfKT3TCaPnJfoSFR2KstVeJ2LBzr38Z6vi8" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Source: Glassnode</em></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-does-the-declining-correlation-mean"><strong>What Does the Declining Correlation Mean?</strong></h2>



<p>The decoupling of BTC from the stock and traditional market, as well as its negative connection with gold is a welcome move because the leading cryptocurrency is showcasing itself as a different asset class. This might be the case as more big players continue penetrating the Bitcoin market.</p>



<p>Notably, correlation illustrates the tendency of two items to move in a similar or opposite direction after a given period of time.</p>



<p>The comparison between gold and BTC has gained steam over the years, especially when it comes to the issue of being a hedge against inflation or store of value. Bitcoin’s status as an alternative to gold continues to be tested based on its decentralized nature and finite supply.</p>



<p>Previously, Bitcoin showed a strong correlation with the stock market. This was because whenever the stock market experienced a sharp sell-off, BTC followed suit, especially during periods of economic uncertainty, as showcased during the peak of the pandemic in 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, a research report by Bernstein <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-pierces-30000-for-first-time-since-june-as-bernstein-calls-btc-faster-horse-compared-to-gold/">acknowledged</a> that BTC was a ‘faster horse’ than gold. This was after the top cryptocurrency breached the psychological price of $30K for the first time in April since June 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to a recent survey conducted by Binance, a staggering 88% of institutional investors have expressed a bullish outlook for the next decade in the world of cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>The &#8220;Institutional Crypto Outlook Survey&#8221; survey collected responses from 208 Binance institutional clients and VIP users from March 31 to May 15, 2023, providing valuable insights into their attitudes, preferences, adoption, and motivations regarding cryptocurrency investments.</p>



<p>One of the most notable findings is that 63.5% of the respondents expressed a positive outlook for crypto in the next 12 months. However, when looking ahead to the next decade, an overwhelming majority of 88% indicated their positive sentiment, indicating a strong belief in the long-term potential of cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>The survey highlights that 47.1% of institutional investors maintained their crypto allocation over the past year, while 35.6% increased their allocation during the same period. The report noted that 50% of respondents expect to increase their allocation to crypto further, demonstrating a growing confidence in the asset class. Interestingly, only 4.3% of respondents anticipate reducing their crypto allocation in the next 12 months.</p>



<p>Regarding areas of interest, the survey also revealed that institutional investors are particularly focused on infrastructure, with 53.9% of respondents considering it the most important sector for them or their funds.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Infrastructure, L1 and L2 are areas of focus among institutional investors. 53.9% of investors found infrastructure to be the sector of most importance to them or their funds. This was closely followed by L1 and L2 sectors at 48.1% and 43.8%, respectively. In terms of usage, DeFi dApps were the most widely used in recent months,&#8221;</em> the survey <a href="https://research.binance.com/static/pdf/institutional-crypto-outlook-survey-2023.pdf">report</a> noted.</p>



<p>Notably, regulatory risk emerged as the primary concern for institutional investors, followed by counterparty and custody risks for institutional investors. Interestingly, price volatility did not deter the group, with most expressing high comfort levels with cryptocurrency volatility.</p>



<p>However, the survey highlighted that institutional investors believe increased real-world use cases and regulatory clarity will drive cryptocurrency adoption. As the industry matures, these investors foresee a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies in mainstream applications and a more supportive regulatory environment.</p>



<p>The survey comes on the heels of heightened scrutiny over the crypto market, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently filing <a href="https://zycrypto.com/this-is-an-opportunity-to-get-rule-clarity-in-court-coinbase-stresses-on-the-positive-amid-sec-lawsuit/">lawsuits</a> against Binance and Coinbase in its crypto enforcement barrage. However, institutions have remained undeterred, as demonstrated by the numerous Spot Bitcoin ETF filings by prominent firms such as WisdomTree, BlackRock, VanEck, and Fidelity.</p>

<p>Yann Allemann, co-founder of popular crypto on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has expressed optimism about Ethereum&#8217;s future even as the cryptocurrency continues to display resilience in the face of regulatory challenges within the crypto market.</p>



<p>In a tweet on July 5, the pundit highlighted <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ethereums-buterin-voices-sympathy-for-solana-and-other-tokens-targeted-by-sec/">Ethereum&#8217;s</a> recent price action, noting by price reclaiming the key support level of $1,900 and surging to $1,950, the popular cryptocurrency is showing solid signs of bullish momentum.</p>



<p>Despite its impressive rebound in the first quarter, surging to over $2,150 in April, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has encountered a period of consolidation, facing resistance as it strives to surpass previous price levels. Recently, the price briefly breached the $1,900 mark before retracing after a brief surge to $1,950.</p>



<p>Allemann also emphasized the notable revival of Ether&#8217;s Relative Strength Index (RSI) during its recent upward momentum, stating, <em>&#8220;Backed by an ascending trendline, ETH is positioned for continued expansion. Any potential pullbacks may encounter robust support at $1.8k and $1.65k. Exciting times lie ahead!&#8221;</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/AAAxvPk5KeBeyUmIhpEwu_lhTWKp0HQviv4fAtdOVZdGH_G9jI2H_YFflh7mqBBjQDGPqVjI3QrCmX_Zm8oFCGuIJjUL1uiUcDKgP4Tcm8rwqMM2flBkEn-sGc7DT5yig7SJEl-FIKicvp4X3A8aAQ" alt=""/></figure>



<p>While market volatility is always possible, Yann Allemann&#8217;s noted that potential retracements in Ethereum&#8217;s price could find more substantial support at $1.8k and $1.65k. However, he described this as an opportunity that provides investors with a potential buying opportunity.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/NothinButGains/status/1676714555639218176">tweet</a>, cryptocurrency analyst and trader &#8220;Trader Karl&#8221; highlighted Ethereum&#8217;s price movement, highlighting the $1,910 level. According to the pundit, this resistance level holds significant importance for Ethereum in the short term. If the price manages to break through this level convincingly, it could pave the way for further upward movement, with the following notable resistance point being the April high of $2,100.</p>



<p>Twenty-five-year market veteran Jordan Lindsey shared his analysis on Ether on Wednesday, calling on investors to be cautious even as price trades inside a &#8220;massive contraction&#8221;.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;We are getting close to where we are going to have a resolution of that,</em>&#8221; he <a href="https://twitter.com/TradersMastery/status/1676643227540291584">said</a>, warning that price could break out of either side. He, however, shared his targets, stating that a break above $2,100 could push ETH to around $3,300. Conversely, a breach of the red trendline could trigger a downward move towards $1,140.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/9nn-v2v5jPv5sG-1Z9Ri9rQvIYZJTGLZxl8kbMx5kIBPOq_tJt3FXJqRAhSJxvG6DSZOryUMXYeAsOhzIwo8fWsR2N65jqQT-1QnZS7CtoPZPrvacQXm0jWNwU-V1zl6yHvgoLapBDeYpkXX6tebcw" alt=""/></figure>



<p>That said, Ethereum&#8217;s performance is significant for its ecosystem and the broader cryptocurrency market. As one of the leading cryptocurrencies, Ethereum often sets the tone for other digital assets. Thus, a strong rally in Ethereum could potentially boost the overall market sentiment and encourage further investment in the cryptocurrency space.</p>



<p>At press time, ETH was trading at $1,858, down 0.17% in the past 24 hours, as per data from CoinMarketCap.</p>

<p>Outspoken pro-Ripple lawyer <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-john-deaton-highlights-4-likely-outcomes-in-ripple-vs-sec-suit-as-case-takes-surprising-turn/">John Deaton</a> has expressed optimism regarding the SEC vs Ripple lawsuit, predicting that Judge Torres will thoroughly address the core question of whether XRP is a security in her upcoming summary judgment.</p>



<p>In a Twitter thread on Monday, Deaton firmly asserted that &#8220;XRP IS NOT A SECURITY.&#8221; He then established parallels between XRP and diverse assets like orange groves, whiskey, condos, and even Bitcoin (BTC). Deaton&#8217;s argument centred on the notion that despite these assets being marketed and sold as investment contracts, their inherent characteristics remained unaltered.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;BTC was once sold as an investment contract (SEC v. Shavers), but that particular sale didn&#8217;t transform BTC into anything other than what it is: a digital commodity,&#8221; </em>he stated.</p>



<p>Further, contrary to the belief of many experienced lawyers, Deaton asserted that Judge Torres would not shy away from addressing the issue of secondary sales concerning <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-lawsuit-crypto-lawyer-sheds-light-on-imminent-judgment-in-sec-case-as-xrp-army-awaits-verdict/">XRP</a>.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;I believe Judge Torres has to address the underlying asset and secondary market sales. Could she avoid the issues and issue a ruling? Of course she could. But it would be a greater act of judicial activism to ignore the SEC&#8217;s theory and NOT address these issues,&#8221; </em>he said.</p>



<p>To support his argument, Deaton referred to a similar case handled by Judge Castel in 2020 involving the Telegram messaging app. This legal dispute began when the SEC intervened and halted Telegram&#8217;s intended distribution of GRAM tokens. However, Judge Castel ruled in favour of the SEC, stating that Telegram had to repay investors $1.2 billion from their unsuccessful initial coin offering (ICO) for the Telegram Open Network.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is important to remember that the theory posited by the SEC was that Ripple engaged in continuous activity resembling an ICO, considering each sale of XRP as part of a broader plan involving securities. However, Deaton clarified that the situation with XRP differed from the Telegram case because the latter involved an ICO with written contracts.</p>



<p>Deaton further contended that XRP, powered by the XRP Ledger (XRPL) technology, had been operating effectively and openly traded for over seven years. Notably, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/john-deaton-debates-ripple-security-claims-as-holders-admit-lack-of-research-before-buying-xrp/">even SEC staff</a> members were permitted to own XRP until 2019, which was not the case with the Gram token.</p>



<p>The issue of secondary market transactions of XRP has been a crucial aspect in the SEC and Ripple legal battle. While the SEC accused Ripple of offering XRP as an unregistered security, it did not clearly distinguish between Ripple&#8217;s direct sales and the subsequent trading on the secondary market, leading to confusion. Recently, Deaton opined that Judge Torres might address this issue based on a previous examination in the SEC vs LBRY lawsuit, as it sheds more light on the issue.</p>



<p>That said, while there&#8217;s no guarantee, Judge Torres&#8217; summary judgment decision could shed light on XRP&#8217;s security classification, potentially impacting the crypto industry significantly.</p>

<p>BlackRock, the World&#8217;s largest asset manager, has submitted a revised application for a Bitcoin-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF) to U.S. regulators through Nasdaq.</p>



<p>The filing, which was done on June 29, named Coinbase Global Inc. as a partner, tasked with providing the so-called surveillance support for the proposed ETF due to its huge dollar-to-bitcoin trading volume in the U.S. Notably, according to the document reviewed by ZyCrypto, BlackRock&#8217;s resubmission depict a valid agreement with Coinbase that took effect on June 16.</p>



<p>The decision to amend the application follows recent feedback from the SEC, which deemed initial filings by various issuers such as BlackRock and Fidelity insufficient and lacking the necessary information on the spot bitcoin exchange and surveillance-sharing agreement.</p>



<p>BlackRock&#8217;s initial filing on June 15 mentioned the need for a surveillance-sharing agreement without specifying the exchange that would partner with them. However, other companies, including Fidelity Investments, Invesco, VanEck, 21Shares, and WisdomTree, updated their applications and named Coinbase their surveillance partner.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, as BlackRock&#8217;s latest filing comes to light, concerns arise regarding potential conflicts of interest involving the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These concerns stem from the fact that the SEC has recently taken <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-suffers-double-whammy-as-sec-and-state-regulators-act-against-exchange-for-unregistered-securities/">legal action against Coinbase</a>, accusing the exchange of engaging in the sale of unregistered securities.</p>



<p>In a Monday tweet, pro-ripple lawyer John Deaton hit out at the SEC, claiming that BlackRock&#8217;s filing exposed the agency’s shortcomings.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;The SEC/Gary Gensler are essentially claiming Coinbase is running an illegal business, yet the largest Asset Manager in the World and others are disclosing their intent to do business with this illegal business. It tells you all you need to know about what&#8217;s really going on,&#8221; </em>said Deaton<em>&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Ryan Selkins, the founder and CEO of the crypto data research firm Messari, also expressed his views on the matter. In a July 4 tweet, the pundit stated that the recent news of BlackRock, WisdomTree, and Fidelity choosing Coinbase as their exchange partners simply confirmed what was already known; <em>&#8220;Coinbase is a legitimate U.S. financial institution, and Gary Gensler is a corrupt crony capitalist.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>In a critical tone, Selkins further remarked that Gary Gensler, the current SEC chairman, is a &#8220;corrupt crony capitalist&#8221;, adding that he expects significant developments once Gensler steps down from his position, a resignation he believes will be requested by the White House before the year concludes.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, as the debate surrounding the implementation of a U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF unfolds, the World&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency has continued to hold strong after an 88% increase year-to-date and a 14% surge in the last month alone. As the SEC continues its scrutiny of Bitcoin spot ETF applications, the industry eagerly awaits further developments, with the expectation that an early approval could propel the price of BTC towards its all-time highs.</p>



<p>At the time of reporting, BTC was trading at $30,209, up just over 1% in the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>For investors and holders of MATIC, tensions remain high. According to data, whale buying activity has increased significantly, demonstrating high support and confidence in the project. Large-scale investors appear to know Polygon&#8217;s technology&#8217;s potential and advancements.</p>



<p>Polygon also unveiled &#8220;The Value Prop,&#8221; an open library of blockchain use cases along with the price recovery. This is a significant development as this extensive catalogue features more than 300 applications and several use examples from a range of industry verticals, blockchain networks, and geographic regions. The effort attempts to emphasize blockchain technology&#8217;s beneficial uses outside of asset trading by portraying it as a flexible tool with practical utility.</p>



<p>The crypto community has noticed and backed Polygon&#8217;s dedication to pushing blockchain application cases. The action is a key step toward boosting blockchain technology usage and recognition. The industry has expressed curiosity and excitement in Polygon&#8217;s presentation of upgradeable smart contracts. With the help of these upgradeable smart contracts, developers can modify and update their contracts to increase flexibility and adaptability.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Polygon is also working on “System Smart Contracts Governance”, as Mateusz Rzeszowski, governance facilitator of Polygon Labs, said: <em>“Following the first pillar, we present an approach to upgradeable contracts in Polygon protocols, including a potential governance model which allows for both security and decentralization.”</em></p>



<p>The suggested Ecosystem Council model proposes a decentralized, community-controlled council of credible and tech-savvy persons who can change system smart contracts in a timelock-restricted manner. The community would vote for the council using the $MATIC token, which would be up for election and removal. Polygon Labs notes that any Polygon protocol would require a unique check on the council&#8217;s operations. The governance approach seeks to reconcile effective council governance with community control, requiring less active governance and mitigating potential attack vectors.</p>



<p>Rzeszowski added, “This type of governance can minimize requirements for active governance, voter fatigue, and apathy, as well as potential attack vectors connected to, for example, regularly held elections.<em>”</em></p>



<p>Despite recent turbulence, these promising developments within the Polygon ecosystem have helped rebuild trust in the project. The price recovery and the introduction of &#8220;The Value Prop&#8221; have shown how committed Polygon is to promoting blockchain technology and giving its consumers real value.</p>



<p>As the cryptocurrency industry expands, initiatives like Polygon seek to show blockchain technology&#8217;s potential beyond cryptocurrencies. The range of use cases in &#8220;The Value Prop&#8221; database may inspire entrepreneurs, companies, and developers to research the possibilities presented by blockchain in solving modern issues.</p>



<p>The resilience of Polygon in the face of turbulence and its proactive strategy to push blockchain use cases strengthen its status as a top Web3 network. Investors and business leaders continue to show interest in and support for the initiative.</p>

<p>Binance has managed to defy fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) over the past 24 hours amidst growing regulatory scrutiny and the recent departure of several top executives.</p>



<p>This follows a Thursday <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/07/06/binance-crisis-executives-quit-changpeng-zhao-justice-department/">report</a> by Fortune that the exchange&#8217;s General Counsel Han Ng, Chief Strategy Officer Patrick Hillmann, and Senior Vice President for Compliance Steven Christie had all tendered their resignations in the past week.</p>



<p>As per Fortune&#8217;s report, the resignations were allegedly influenced by investigations initiated by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) against the exchange. The investigations focused on allegations of money laundering, violations of sanctions, and purported efforts to mislead regulators in the United States. Reportedly some insiders also claimed that the recent departures of executives were significantly influenced by <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-boss-zhao-tips-when-the-next-unstoppable-bitcoin-bull-run-will-begin/">Binance CEO</a> Changpeng Zhao&#8217;s &#8220;CZ&#8221; response to the Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation.</p>



<p>However, Hillmann took to Twitter to clarify that his departure was due to personal reasons and not due to any conflict with CZ or the exchange.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>&#8220;It&#8217;s true that I am leaving Binance, but I&#8217;m doing so on good terms. I continue to respect and support CZ and am grateful for having had the incredible opportunity to work under his leadership,&#8221;</em> said Hillman.</p>



<p>On the other hand, while confirming that he is indeed leaving the company, Christie emphasized on Friday that the reasons for his departure are different from what was reported. Having been involved in crypto compliance since 2015, he expressed feeling tired and acknowledged the need to lose some weight, as well as spend more time with his family.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, responding to media inquiries regarding his departure from Binance, Noah Perlman, the Chief Compliance Officer, clarified that he was not leaving the organization, tweeting, &#8220;<em>I&#8217;m proud to be part of this incredible organization as we navigate the growing pains of the crypto industry.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>CZ himself addressed the departures on Twitter, attributing them to regular turnover rather than the speculative reasons suggested by the media.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;More FUD about some departures. Yes, there is turnover (at every company). But the reasons dreamed up by the &#8220;news&#8221; are completely wrong,&#8221;</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1677092535871602691">said</a> CZ.</p>



<p>He emphasized that as the crypto market and global landscape evolve, personnel changes are common in any organization. CZ further thanked the former team members for their contributions to Binance&#8217;s growth and wished them the best in their future endeavours.</p>



<p>That said, despite the ongoing controversies and legal challenges, Binance has exhibited remarkable resilience, attracting a significant influx of deposits that reflect the continued confidence traders have in the exchange. According to data from DefiLama, within the past 24 hours, approximately $1.99 billion in deposits have been made to the platform, underscoring the enduring trust and support Binance enjoys within the crypto community.</p>



<p>The crypto market has also been displaying a notable level of stability, as Bitcoin reclaimed its position above $30,000 shortly after experiencing a minor dip following the Fortune report.</p>

<p>BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager and currently the de-facto leader of the ETF movement, applied with the SEC last month, driving optimism and higher bitcoin prices.</p>



<p>While most crypto fans believe the hoped-for successful approval of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the U.S. would be a seminal moment in the history of crypto, JPMorgan analysts claim such a move by the SEC would not have a significant impact on the market for a couple of reasons.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-spot-bitcoin-etfs-have-rather-marginal-benefits"><strong>Spot Bitcoin ETFs Have “Rather Marginal” Benefits</strong></h2>



<p>The news surrounding a flurry of applications from the likes of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-primed-for-trillion-dollar-boost-as-blackrock-expects-landmark-bitcoin-etf-approval/">BlackRock</a>, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/11-1-trillion-giant-fidelity-renews-push-for-spot-bitcoin-etf/">Fidelity</a>, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/spot-bitcoin-etf-craze-valkyrie-becomes-the-latest-firm-to-apply-for-sec-approval/">Valkyrie</a>, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-etfs-in-motion-an-analysis-of-open-spot-btc-etf-applications-in-the-market/">WisdomTree</a>,<a href="https://zycrypto.com/ark-invest-gains-edge-in-spot-bitcoin-etf-race-with-epic-surveillance-sharing-maneuver/"> ARK Invest</a>, and others, for a spot bitcoin ETF sent the price of the bellwether crypto to multi-month highs. For most enthusiasts, this was a sign that institutional investment into the cryptoverse was once again upon us.</p>



<p>However, JPMorgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou point out in a Thursday report that spot BTC ETFs have long existed in Canada and Europe without garnering much investor interest, hence “the potential approval of physically backed bitcoin ETFs by the SEC [Securities and Exchange Commission] is unlikely to be a game changer for crypto markets.&#8221;</p>



<p>The analysts also acknowledged that spot BTC ETFs provide certain advantages over futures bitcoin ETFs, but these benefits are “rather marginal”. Physically-backed Bitcoin ETFs would allow a large swath of retail American investors to have skin in the game without having to store the cryptocurrency themselves. Unlike the futures-based ETFs, these spot ETFs also have the potential to reflect real-time supply and demand more accurately, causing improved liquidity and enhanced price transparency, as per JPMorgan analysts.</p>



<p>Yet, the launch of spot bitcoin ETFs could transfer trading activity from bitcoin futures markets in the U.S. &#8220;to the extent spot bitcoin ETFs replace futures-based bitcoin ETFs,&#8221; they added.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Will 2023 Be The Year Of The Spot Bitcoin ETF?</strong></h2>



<p>While several high-profile funds and companies have filed paperwork for spot Bitcoin ETFs with the SEC in the past, all have either backed out or faced outright denials from the U.S. regulator since 2017. In Canada, however, key funds, including Purpose Bitcoin, 3iQ CoinShares, and CI Galaxy Bitcoin — all directly invested in spot BTC — are already available for customers.</p>



<p>JPMorgan strategists believe the SEC might actually OK one of the recent new applications for the long-awaited spot product because some of the regulator’s previous concerns are assumed to be addressed as the would-be ETF issuers have indicated their intention to enter into surveillance-sharing agreements with Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the US. Under a surveillance-sharing agreement, information about market trading and clearing activities is shared between entities to deter any potential market manipulation.</p>



<p>Last month, the SEC approved the first leveraged bitcoin futures ETF, Volatility Shares 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITX). The open question now is whether the commission will also approve the first-ever spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. this year. </p>

<p>Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has shrugged off news of top executives leaving the exchange, reportedly over his handling of regulatory investigations. Zhao said it was “FUD,” claiming the reasons for the execs&#8217; departures are “dreamed up” and “completely wrong.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-top-binance-executives-bow-out"><strong>Top Binance Executives Bow Out</strong></h2>



<p>A surprising number of key executive personnel at Binance have resigned from their posts.</p>



<p>According to a June 6 <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/07/06/binance-crisis-executives-quit-changpeng-zhao-justice-department/">report </a>from <em>Fortune </em>citing an internal source, executives in senior leadership positions, including chief strategy officer Patrick Hillmann, general counsel Han Ng, senior director of investigations Matthew Price, and senior vice president for compliance Steven Christie exited the exchange over CEO Changpeng Zhao’s response to the U.S. Justice Department’s investigation. The DoJ is purportedly <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-05/binance-faces-us-probe-of-possible-russian-sanctions-violations">probing </a>Binance for allowing Russians to use the crypto exchange in violation of U.S. sanctions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The news publication also labelled the top personnel’s decision to resign from the exchange “a management and strategic crisis for Binance”. </p>



<p>Hillmann, however, said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/PRHillmann/status/1677070523740884992">tweet </a>that he was leaving Binance on good terms after a two-year tenure and it’s “simply time for me to move on to the next challenge”, adding that his wife was about to give birth to their second child, “so the time is right for me to step aside.”</p>



<p>“More FUD about some departures. Yes, there is turnover (at every company). But the reasons dreamed up by the “news” are completely wrong,” CZ tweeted in response to the high-profile departures. “As markets and the global environment for crypto changes, as our organization evolves, and as personal situations change, there is turnover at every company.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">4. More FUD about some departures. Yes, there is turnover (at every company). But the reasons dreamed up by the “news” are completely wrong.<br><br>As an organization that has grown from 30 to 8000 people in 6 years, from 0 to the world’s largest crypto exchange in less than 5 months…</p>&mdash; CZ <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f536.png" alt="🔶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Binance (@cz_binance) <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1677092535871602691?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 6, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Notably, there have also been replacements following these resignations. A different <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-06/binance-executive-patrick-hillmann-us-employees-leave-as-crisis-deepens#xj4y7vzkg">report </a>from <em>Bloomberg</em>, also citing a source, noted that Eleanor Hughes, previously Binance’s Head of Legal for APAC and MENA regions, is set to become the new general counsel, stepping into Ng’s shoes. Noah Perlamn, who joined Binance as the chief compliance officer in February, will stay at the company.</p>



<p>The management reshuffles at Binance come as the exchange is the subject of enforcement action from multiple regulators. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">sued </a>Binance on allegations of violating federal securities laws and misusing customer funds. The world’s largest exchange was also <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-ether-slump-as-cftc-sues-binance-and-cz-over-willful-violation-of-u-s-laws/">accused </a>by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) of failing to register properly before offering commodities trading services.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is changing hands for over $30,000 per coin as institutional capital floods into the market following a number of high-profile exchange-traded fund filings.</p>



<p>But when will the bellwether cryptocurrency enter a new super-bullish cycle?</p>



<p>Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao recently shared his prediction for the next parabolic Bitcoin bull run while giving his thoughts on BlackRock’s giant entry into the crypto market.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-relentless-btc-bull-run-likely-after-halving-zhao"><strong>Relentless </strong><strong>BTC Bull Run Likely After Halving: Zhao</strong></h2>



<p>Binance chief executive officer Changpeng Zhao has revealed when he expects the onset of the next major bull run.</p>



<p>Speaking during a Twitter AMA session on July 5, Zhao noted that the price of bitcoin has typically moved in four-year-long cycles, and he believed this trend would likely continue. Although the Binance chief acknowledged that he could not predict the future accurately, Zhao maintained that 2025 would be the most likely year for the next majestic bull market as it will be the year after the next Bitcoin halving event. “The year after Bitcoin halving is usually the bull year,” CZ said.</p>



<p>True to form, BTC tends to chalk out massive gains in the months after halving the mining rewards. The fourth halving is due in early 2024.</p>



<p>During the “ask me anything” session, Zhao also said that BlackRock’s recent foray into the spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund territory is “hugely beneficial” for the nascent cryptocurrency industry.</p>



<p>BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with $9.5 trillion under management, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-primed-for-trillion-dollar-boost-as-blackrock-expects-landmark-bitcoin-etf-approval/">applied </a>to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) a few weeks ago.</p>



<p>Pundits think the odds are in favour of the financial giant, which is almost unbeaten when going up against the SEC, at 575-1, as nearly every single one of its ETF filings has received a green light.</p>



<p>Bitcoin may be far below the all-time high of $69,044 it registered in November 2021, but this much is undeniable: It had transcended expectations in 2023 by jumping over 85% since the beginning of the year when it was trading at around $17,000. BTC has spiked by circa 20% since BlackRock’s spot ETF filing, wildly as more companies <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-etfs-in-motion-an-analysis-of-open-spot-btc-etf-applications-in-the-market/">rushed to submit their applications</a>.</p>



<p>Zhao further dismissed some worries that BlackRock could take up Binance’s market share in the course of time, noting that the overlap between their respective customer bases was “minimal.”</p>



<p>“Anyone who’s coming into crypto that’s not in crypto today will bring additional people into crypto. Will they compete for any of the existing users with us? Yes, probably a little bit. But to be honest, look at our user base. The overlap is minimal.”</p>



<p>For Zhao, the heightened institutional demand and Bitcoin’s forthcoming halving are the two key factors why Binance aims to be “prepared for higher [trading] volumes” in the coming eighteen months.</p>

<p>Gemini has escalated its conflict with Digital Currency Group (DCG) after approximately seven months since Genesis Global Trading, DCG&#8217;s lending arm, suspended withdrawals.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss presented Barry Silbert, the founder of DCG, with a &#8220;best and final offer&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/cameron/status/1676024844641550337">letter</a> to settle the $1.465 billion debt owed to Gemini. Winklevoss&#8217;s letter carried a clear request, threatening legal action against Silbert and DCG if an agreement is not reached by July 6.</p>



<p>The proposed settlement further outlined payments in intervals and specified that they would be denominated in BTC, ETH, and U.S. dollars. Notably, the settlement also included a significant forbearance payment of $275 million, which Winklevoss expects to be fulfilled on July 21.</p>



<p>In the latest letter, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/secs-refusal-to-approve-a-spot-bitcoin-etf-makes-it-a-failed-regulator-says-geminis-cameron-winklevoss/">Winklevoss</a> accused Silbert of fraud, alleging that he knowingly lied to creditors, including Gemini, in 2022 regarding DCG&#8217;s absorption of the $1.2 billion losses incurred from Three Arrows Capital&#8217;s collapse. Winklevoss further claimed that DCG employed a &#8220;bogus long-dated promissory note&#8221; to address the financial shortfall while deliberately prolonging the mediation process to raise funds for repaying a $630 million loan.</p>



<p>Winklevoss also expressed frustration with Silbert&#8217;s actions, accusing him of playing the victim during the whole process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;<em>It takes a special kind of person to owe $3.3 billion dollars to hundreds of thousands of people and believe, or at least pretend to believe, that they are some kind of victim. Not even Sam Bankman-Friend was capable of such delusion,&#8221; </em>said<em> </em>Winklevoss.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Notably, the long-drawn conflict arose from a partnership gone soar between the two sides regarding Gemini&#8217;s Earn product. Launched in early 2021, Gemini Earn was a high-yield program that allowed customers to lend their crypto assets to Genesis. Genesis then invested the funds in institutions and paid investors an 8% interest. However, following FTX&#8217;s collapse last November, Genesis halted customer withdrawals, leaving Gemini unable to repay its Earn customers.</p>



<p>In January, Winklevoss made a public statement <a href="https://zycrypto.com/gemini-vows-legal-action-against-genesis-parent-company-amidst-bankruptcy-filing/">alleging</a> that approximately 340,000 participants in the yield-bearing product were owed around $900 million by Genesis. The exchange further shut down the Earn program and dissolved the master loan agreement between its customers and Genesis.</p>



<p>In response, Barry Silbert defended his integrity and good intentions in a letter to DCG shareholders, blaming the failures on the 2022 crypto winter. The two entities then turned to mediation without success, with Winkelvoss blaming Silbert for completely undermining the process.</p>



<p>That said, as the deadline looms, it will be interesting to see the outcome of the settlement negotiations, with a positive outcome potentially benefiting thousands of Earn users.</p>

<p>Coinbase stocks soared over 11% earlier this week following the mention of the exchange as a surveillance partner in Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) refiled Bitcoin spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) application. The CBOE refiled a spot Bitcoin ETF application on Friday last week on behalf of  Fidelity, WisdomTree, VanEck and Invesco products.</p>



<p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had last week dismissed the latest Bitcoin ETF applications, saying they were inadequate because they lacked surveillance partners. Shortly after, CBOE refiled the applications, naming Coinbase as a surveillance partner.</p>



<p>Following the refiling, Coinbase stocks shot up on Monday’s session as investors seem optimistic about the outcome of the ETF application. According to the filing, the CBOE said that Coinbase will “supplement its ability to obtain information that would be helpful in detecting, investigating, and deterring fraud and market manipulation.”</p>



<p>There have been several applications for a Bitcoin ETF in the past, but only futures Bitcoin ETFs have been approved so far. However, investment managers are seeking a spot ETF, which is expected to boost investor confidence in the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin.</p>



<p>The SEC has refused to approve any of the ETF applications, citing fears of market manipulation. After meeting the condition of adding a surveillance partner, there may be hope for approval this time around.</p>



<p>Similarly, NASDAQ on Monday, 3 July refiled Bitcoin ETF applications on behalf of iShares Bitcoin Trust and BlackRock since BlackRock is seeking to launch its ETF through NASDAQ.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;The Spot BTC SSA is expected to be a bilateral surveillance-sharing agreement between Nasdaq and Coinbase that is intended to supplement the Exchange’s market surveillance program,&#8221; the filing reads.</em></p>



<p>This is coming at a time when Coinbase is in court, facing allegations of securities laws violation levelled against it by the SEC. It remains to be seen if the court case will disqualify Coinbase as a surveillance partner for the two refiled ETF applications.</p>



<p>However, with the two filings listing Coinbase as a surveillance partner, investors’ confidence may continue to soar with a resultant rise in the prices of Coinbase stocks in the coming days. The effect may also spill to Bitcoin, further fueling the ongoing rally.</p>
