Transactions on Shibarium occur &#8220;off-chain&#8221; and are communicated back to the Ethereum blockchain, which allows for lower costs and faster processing times. Shibarium also provides a robust development framework for the community to build their vision into the blockchain, and has potential uses in gaming, social media, education, and supply chains. The platform also supports Non-Fungible Tokens [&#8230;]
