Marathon will match donations made to Brink on a two-for-one basis for the duration of the conference, which ends on May 20, and then match donations one for one through the end of the year, up to $1 million total.</p><p>“We’re going to match dollar for dollar $500,000-worth of donations that Brink receives for Core developers. More importantly, we will donate two-for-one if you donate money during this conference,” said Fred Thiel, Marathon’s CEO. “So, if you believe in the importance of supporting Core development efforts … then I strongly urge you (to) donate 50 cents, $1, whatever you can during the conference.”</p><p>By committing to match all third-party donations up to an aggregate of $500,000 until December 31, 2023, Marathon hopes to advance Brink’s support for the developers who maintain and upgrade Bitcoin’s code. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/john-newberys-new-nonprofit-brink-will-train-and-support-bitcoin-developers">Since 2020</a>, Brink has supported numerous developers in their work to make Bitcon more accessible and advanced through grants, mentorship and education, including <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-non-profit-brink-funds-11-bitcoin-lightning-developers">former lead maintainer Marco Falke, Lightning Network white paper author Tadge Dryja</a> and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-non-profit-brink-funds-11-bitcoin-lightning-developers">Bitcoin Core PR Review Club’s Gloria Zhao</a>.</p><p>“We have nine developers in five different countries that are all independent developers funded by Brink,” explained Mike Schmidt, the executive director of Brink. “I think we would all agree that we would want this Bitcoin software that’s powering all of this innovation on top to be better reviewed, better tested, better maintained, easier to run and more performant. So that’s why at Brink we fund grantees that are spending upwards of 50% of their time on testing and reviewing the Bitcoin Core code, proposing changes to the Core codebase and basically making that software more secure.”</p><p>Donations made to Brink through <a href="https://brink.dev/donate">its website</a> are now eligible for the match. Thiel framed the campaign as part of Marathon’s larger commitment to securing the Bitcoin network as a significant contributor of hash rate, the computing power that ensures Bitcoin’s immutability.</p><p>“We believe that it’s the most secure protocol out there and we think we and the rest of the industry should do everything they can to support the developers and really foment as much activity in the space as possible,” Thiel said.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk4MDQxMjk5NTc0NTk2Njgw/bitcoin-2023-brink-marathon-digital-donation-campaign.jpg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[IBEX Mercado Announces Partnership With Grupo Salinas Bringing Lightning Access To Millions Of Mexican Citizens]]></title><description><![CDATA[The partnership kicked off with one of Mexico’s largest internet providers, Total Play, partnering with IBEX to integrate bitcoin Lightning payments.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-lightning-service-ibex-mercado-announces-partnership-with-grupo-salinas</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-lightning-service-ibex-mercado-announces-partnership-with-grupo-salinas</guid><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Ricardo Salinas]]></category><category><![CDATA[Lightning]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mexico]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[IBEX]]></category><category><![CDATA[IBEX Mercado]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 18 May 2023 21:42:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyODY4MzAyMTgyMjI5NzEy/markets-price-chart.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><a href="https://www.poweredbyibex.io/">IBEX Mercado</a>, a bitcoin Lightning payment service provider, has announced a new partnership with Grupo Salinas, one of the largest corporate conglomerates in Mexico.</p><p>“Over four million Mexicans can now pay with bitcoin for their cable, internet, and phone service,” IBEX’s CEO Jose Lemus said on stage as he announced the partnership. “With this partnership, we’re opening the doors to every bitcoin and Lightning company and financial tech company that wants to leverage Lightning technology … [we will be] rolling out new technology with Grupo Salinas that will enable mexicans to pay their groceries with bitcoin, electronics and to receive remittances.” Lemus explained his excitement about the announcement, saying that this is the “tip of the iceberg of what will go on in Mexico.” </p><p>The collaboration signifies a major step in Mexico's adoption of bitcoin and Lightning.

Dr. Zuoxing Yang, the founder and CEO of MicroBT, highlighted the importance of "High density, low noise, low failure rate and low maintenance” ASIC machines bringing bitcoin mining to a new era.</p><p>The talk started with a roll of film focusing on the energy crisis, green energy and the role that bitcoin can play as a solution. It then posed the question: “What matters more, mining or surviving?” </p><p>“I never stop thinking of better power solutions for bitcoin mining,” Dr. Yang said. </p><p>MicroBT introduced three new models of the WhatsMiner M50 series: the air-cooled M50S++, the hydro-cooled M53S++, and the immersion cooled M56S++. These models offer impressive computing power ranging from 150 to 320 terahash/second (TH/s) respectively, with power efficiencies of 22 joules per terahash (J/TH).</p><p>Dr. Yang highlighted the heat collection capabilities of the mining rigs, which can be utilized for various purposes, such as space heating and industrial processes. He mentioned that the hydro-cooling mining rigs can reach outlet water temperatures of over 70℃ (158℉), enabling 2.4MW of power for a 40-foot container. Additionally, the immersion-cooling solution requires only 10L of oil per miner, demonstrating its efficiency.</p><p>He emphasized that “every M56 miner only requires as low as 10L oil with our specified tank.” </p><p>MicroBT's focus since its inception in 2016 has been the development of high-efficiency Bitcoin mining rigs. The company aims to support miners in adhering to Bitcoin's decentralization principles while prioritizing network stability. Dr. Yang emphasized MicroBT's commitment to working with partners to promote sustainable mining practices, zero-carbon emissions and social responsibility.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwOTE3NzExNjQ2MTcyNzU3/aa-btc-4.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[BitMEX To Send Physical Bitcoin To The Moon In Partnership With Astrobiotic Technology And Bitcoin Magazine]]></title><description><![CDATA[A physical coin loaded with 1 BTC, along with the Genesis Block text, will venture beyond the atmosphere on a space launch this summer.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitmex-to-send-physical-bitcoin-to-the-moon</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitmex-to-send-physical-bitcoin-to-the-moon</guid><category><![CDATA[Bitmex]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Moon]]></category><category><![CDATA[Moon Landing]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 18 May 2023 19:55:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzMjU1NjA1NDIxNDgzNTg3/bitcoin-to-the-moon.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>BitMEX, a leading bitcoin derivatives exchange, has announced that it will be sending the first physical bitcoin to the Moon in partnership with Astrobotic Technology Inc. and Bitcoin Magazine.

Utilizing Lava's loan protocol, users can borrow stablecoins against native bitcoin, eliminating the risks associated with bridge hacks and custodian rehypothecation.</p><p>CEO Shehzan Maredia highlighted the advantages of Lava's borrowing mechanism, stating, "With Lava, people can borrow transparently without rehypothecation risk and without relying on bridges or custodians. Users won't have to trust their counterparty and can borrow using a system that gives users cryptographic assurance that the rules of their contracts will be honored." Lava achieves this through invisible smart contracts called <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/dlcs-on-lightning-and-bitcoin-smart-contracts">discreet log contracts</a> (DLCs), which ensure collateral integrity and enable programmable loan initiation and repayment without the need for intermediaries.</p><p>According to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, Lava wallet aims to empower individuals who face challenges with traditional banking, offering innovative security solutions and safety checks to prevent transaction errors. Maredia said that he envisions bitcoin and dollars as the two most crucial assets of the coming decade. Lava's goal, the press release stated, is to create a bitcoin and dollar-centric financial experience that grants users true financial freedom, enabling them to take control of their finances and simplify money management.</p><p>In an interview, Maredia expressed gratitude to his cofounder, team, investors, and supporters, emphasizing that this is only the beginning for Lava. The company said it intends to continue advancing its mission of making finance sovereign and simple.</p><p>Lava's self-custody wallet is currently available on mobile platforms, including iOS and Android, with plans for additional interfaces in the future. </p><p>The company said it intends to differentiate itself from other self-custody wallets through its user-centered financial utility experience including offering borrowing against bitcoin, direct purchases of bitcoin and stablecoins, seamless bank account transfers and simplified transactions. Security is a top priority — Lava stated that there will be future enhancements like collaborative custody and cold wallet integration.</p><p><em>Disclosure: Lava is a portfolio company of BTC Inc., the parent company of Bitcoin Magazine.</em></p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkxNzU0OTcxNDk3MTEzMjUx/20220819_best-sidechain-recap---shinobi.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cash App, Lighting Labs, Lightspark Executives Discuss Bringing Bitcoin Payments To The World]]></title><description><![CDATA[In a panel discussion at Bitcoin 2023, leaders from some of the largest Bitcoin-focused companies discussed building on the Lightning Network.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/building-lightning-network-companies</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/building-lightning-network-companies</guid><category><![CDATA[Lightning Labs]]></category><category><![CDATA[Lightspark]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Lightning network]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin 2023]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cash App]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Peter Chawaga]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 18 May 2023 16:13:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk4MDM2MTQxNTg3MzEwMDE5/fwbgj1mwaaqn5h9.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>In a panel discussion at the Bitcoin 2023 conference moderated by CNBC technology reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/KenzieSigalos">MacKenzie Sigalos</a>, leaders from some of the biggest businesses building services based on the Lightning Network discussed the opportunities and challenges for Bitcoin’s payments-focused second layer protocol.</p><p>The discussion, titled “Building Lightning-Native Companies,” featured <a href="https://twitter.com/starkness">Elizabeth Stark</a>, the CEO of software development firm Lightning Labs; <a href="https://twitter.com/davidmarcus">David Marcus</a>, the CEO of <a href="https://www.lightspark.com/">Lightspark</a>, a firm focused on making Lightning adoption easier and more accessible; and <a href="https://twitter.com/milessuter">Miles Suter</a>, the Bitcoin product lead at <a href="https://cash.app/">Cash App</a>, a mobile payment platform that <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/cash-app-enables-bitcoin-lightning-payments-for-40-million-users">introduced Lighting payments to its more than 40 million users in 2022</a>.</p><p>"We've really reached the point right now where Lightning is maturing and we're seeing more and more adoption,” Stark said, summarizing the momentum she has seen since she co-founded Lightning Labs in 2016. “People are adopting the network because it is solving real problems for them."</p><p>By allowing peers to create closed payment channels between themselves, which are only settled on the underlying Bitcoin blockchain when closed, the Lightning Network <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/lightning-network">enables bitcoin payments that can take place in seconds while still benefiting from the security of Bitcoin’s base ledger</a>. But as this second layer is <a href="https://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper.pdf">relatively young</a>, adoption represents <a href="https://bitcoinvisuals.com/lightning">just a fraction</a> of the larger digital payments volume across the world.</p><p>The panelists highlighted the importance of developing products and services that make Lightning easier to use and solve some of its outstanding issues, like the network’s relatively-low liquidity and limited number of nodes.</p><p>“A channel-based payment network is still very complicated,” Sigalos pointed out. “There’s not a ton of liquidity sitting on the nodes right now” for instance.</p><p>In response, Suter noted that many of the challenges in making Lightning more accessible derive from Bitcoin’s most important qualities.</p><p>"It's hard to develop on Bitcoin,” he explained. “We see that everyday... but it's an intentional decision because we believe that's what allows it to maintain a very minimal attack surface.”</p><p>But the panelists all agreed that when there are significant problems for Lightning to solve, like in countries where it can help people access the dollar or enable more efficient cross-border transactions, adoption is evident. As more of those problems emerge and companies like these continue to build products and services on top of Lightning, they expect adoption to accelerate.</p><p>“Making it easy will drive more adoption,” Marcus said. “Between now and next year when we gather again, we’ll be in a much better place when it comes to Lightning adoption.”</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk4MDM2MTQxNTg3MzEwMDE5/fwbgj1mwaaqn5h9.jpg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bitcoin Lightning Company Lightspark Introduces Lightspark Wallet SDK]]></title><description><![CDATA[The SDK is designed to offer businesses and platforms an easily accessible Lightning wallet experience.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/lightspark-introduces-lightspark-wallet-sdk</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/lightspark-introduces-lightspark-wallet-sdk</guid><category><![CDATA[Lightspark]]></category><category><![CDATA[Lightning]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 18 May 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyNjA3MTM2MjI2NzQ4MTUz/20220926_good-gdog-proof-collaborative-custody-multisig-by-will-schoellkopf_.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Lightspark has announced the launch of the Lightspark Wallet SDK, a tool designed to enable businesses of all sizes the ability to offer their customers a Lightning wallet.

It is called a “moratorium on bitcoin mining.” Its origins <a href="https://www.clayconc.com/_files/ugd/fe4bcd_163aefda66f243cfb4f8c41bd27ebce5.pdf">date back to August 2022 in Clay County</a>, and Buncombe County has mutated it into this newest strain based on broadly construing a North Carolina zoning statute to authorize a development moratorium. </p><p>When properly used, North Carolina’s <a href="https://www.ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/BySection/Chapter_160D/GS_160D-107.pdf">development moratorium statute</a> <a href="https://www.sog.unc.edu/resources/legal-summaries/land-use-and-development-moratoria">seeks to ensure that a new type of development does not proceed until changes to regulations or environmental issues are appropriately addressed</a>. This allows for more effective planning and management of growth and development while minimizing potential negative impacts on the community.</p><p>Because a moratorium is a drastic restriction on property rights, the statute imposes conditions that an administrative authority must satisfy to get one. Even then, such a moratorium can only span <a href="https://www.ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/BySection/Chapter_160D/GS_160D-107.pdf">a minimum of 61 days</a> and a maximum of one year, as noted by the planning commissioner <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3e09Xulteg">during a recent public briefing</a>. </p><p>In this case, Buncombe County commissioners, <a href="https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2023/05/04/buncombe-county-approves-a-1-year-moratorium-on-cryptocurrency-mining/70179529007/">under the direction of Planning Director Nathaniel Pennington</a>, argued that they needed a one-year moratorium on cryptocurrency mining in the unincorporated areas of Buncombe County <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3e09Xulteg">so they could study the industry</a> and “<a href="https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2023/05/04/buncombe-county-approves-a-1-year-moratorium-on-cryptocurrency-mining/70179529007/">craft standards for the newly-defined use.</a>” </p><p>But we already have a workable definition for a bitcoin mine, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/drive-bitcoin-right-through-south-carolina">as confirmed in my last opinion editorial</a>,<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/drive-bitcoin-right-through-south-carolina"> </a>where I referred to a bitcoin mine as a “digital asset data center.” So, let’s just simply define a “bitcoin mining center” as a data center that produces an intangible product. </p><p>That’s now where the rubber meets the road. At the February 2023 commission meeting, armed with the American Planning Association’s “<a href="https://www.planning.org/publications/document/9249180/">Zoning for Data Centers and Cryptocurrency Mining</a>,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3e09Xulteg">Pennington argued</a> that cryptocurrency mining centers don’t meet the definition of a data center under existing North Carolina law. </p><p>The North Carolina statute that enables data mining center tax breaks <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2015/10/01/north-carolina-makes-data-center-tax-breaks-easier-to-get">was enacted in 2015</a>, just six years after the birth of bitcoin. Consequently, most states, including North Carolina, are living with statutes tailored for centralized data center operations and incentives that were carved out to attract corporate data centers built by companies like Google, which include large campuses, consume vast amounts of water and require huge amounts of power. Qualified data centers receive sales tax exemption on electricity. </p><p>As a result, North Carolina’s data mining center laws <em>in practice</em> offer big money for the benefit of a select few tech corporations, but the overarching <em>intent</em> of this legal framework was to promote economic development in North Carolina. Rather than follow the original intent of the data center definition to create opportunities, it’s now the club that is being used to discourage siting digital asset data centers in some western North Carolina counties. </p><p>However, in his rush to pass an ordinance where there were no permit applications pending, the planning director failed to include a “statement of the problems or conditions necessitating the moratorium <em> </em>and [that’s the operative word] what courses of action, alternative to a moratorium, were considered … and why those alternative courses of action were not adequate,” as is required by the <a href="https://www.ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/BySection/Chapter_160D/GS_160D-107.pdf">North Carolina General Assembly’s moratoria guidelines</a>.</p><p>So, in my eyes, the planning commission has failed to complete the due diligence legally required to impose a moratorium and appears to be acting with a bias intended to discourage Bitcoin miners from locating in Buncombe County. </p><p>Now that Buncombe County’s overreach has been caught and called out, do we catch and release or seize the opportunity to counter <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3e09Xulteg">unfounded claims</a> of e-waste, noise, water consumption and public safety concerns to get this moratorium overturned by the county’s commissioners or the court system?</p><p>This improperly-enacted moratorium is low-hanging fruit and Bitcoiners need to press public officials like those in Buncombe County who don’t do their job properly or exert a bias without doing their homework. Someone should be held accountable and, in this case, all fingers point in the direction of the Buncombe County Planning Commission and the American Planning Association. </p><p>The way in which Bitcoin mining is treated presents a pivotal moment for Buncombe County’s innovation economy. With their hastily and improperly enacted moratorium, Buncombe County’s commissioners failed to rise to the occasion. </p><p>Rather than ban a perfectly-legal activity that they do not fully understand, the commissioners could have created a countywide task force, but that was never presented as an option. A task force could study the pros and cons of digital assets, while planning could have a seat at the table and serve all of their constituents, not just a vocal minority. That should have been the objective. Instead, the adopted policy stifles innovation and advances a false narrative. </p><p>I know this has not gone unnoticed at the state level and the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/north-carolina-house-passes-bill-banning-cbdc-payments">recent <em>unanimous</em> vote to advance an anti-central-bank-digital-currency (CBDC) bill</a> after <a href="https://twitter.com/NC_Blockchain/status/1649571425726898176?s=20">public uproar</a> resulted in revising a prior anti-Bitcoin bill tells me that progress can be made. Education on all levels is still the key. Hopefully, the Buncombe County commissioners will learn to join the cause or miss out on one of the most important emerging tech industries driving adoption of the soundest money ever invented.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Dennis Fassuliotis.

    </figure><h2>Nigeria’s History With Bitcoin Regulation</h2><p>Taking a deep dive into understanding the disposition of the Nigerian government toward blockchain-dependent innovations over the years will paint a clear picture of how crucial and important this recent policy and federal approval is for the Bitcoin space in Nigeria and Africa at large. </p><p>On January 12, 2017, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) <a href="https://www.cbn.gov.ng/Out/2021/CCD/Letter%20on%20Crypto.pdf">issued a circular</a> which cautioned financial institutions and the general public about the risks associated with blockchain-dependent technologies, such as Bitcoin. Building on that previous warning and directive, on February 5, 2021, the Central Bank of Nigeria <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-will-persist-in-nigeria-but-the-ban-changes-things">officially prohibited banks from facilitating any Bitcoin- and crypto-related transactions</a> by reissuing the circular — a ban that remains unreversed as at the time of writing. </p><p>This restrictive policy come at a time when adoption of Bitcoin and shitcoin-related activities was on the rise in Nigeria, and it was a restriction that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/oluwaseunadeyanju/2021/09/14/bitcoin-opportunity-africa-adoption-rate-is-highest-globally/?sh=55d196fb6d57">further fueled the use of Bitcoin and stablecoins</a> as users who are wallowing in the pains of financial restriction increasingly discovered the power of decentralized Bitcoin innovations, like peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplaces.</p><p>Amid all of these impromptu regulatory measures, CBN was apparently busy creating what it considered an alternative to shitcoins: a government-controlled digital currency called the e-naira, which was <a href="https://www.cbn.gov.ng/out/2021/ccd/enaira%20launch%20press%20release%20%20231021.pdf">officially launched</a> on the October 25, 2021, unequivocally built on a centralized system, not a decentralized blockchain like Bitcoin’s. Meanwhile, Nigeria’s Security And Exchange Commission (SEC) was occupied with <a href="http://forbes.com/sites/oluwaseunadeyanju/2022/05/14/nigeria-issues-crypto-asset-rules-in-a-move-that-could-boost-adoption/?sh=e8c23a212e6d">creating policy frameworks for token-issuance platforms and exchanges</a>.</p><p>All these regulatory changes were not unconnected to the government's awareness of just how thriving the blockchain industry is in Africa’s most populous country.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>What Does This Mean For Bitcoin In Nigeria?</h2><p>At this point, one will naturally ask what another regulatory update in the national blockchain policy means for Bitcoin.</p><p>A quick but detailed response would be: This is definitely a welcomed development for Bitcoin advocates in the country and one of the possibly many steps that we might witness in the right direction.</p><p>From my interpretation, this policy is focused more on giving a direct government overview to relevant regulatory bodies such as the <a href="https://nitda.gov.ng/">National Information Technology Development Agency</a> (NITDA), CBN, SEC, the <a href="https://ncc.gov.ng/">Nigerian Communications Commission</a> (NCC) and the <a href="https://www.nuc.edu.ng/">National Universities Commission</a> (NUC), among many others who are now expected to develop more detailed regulatory frameworks from using blockchain-based innovations like Bitcoin. The government is moving from being totally repelled by or antagonistic about Bitcoin-, blockchain- and crypto-related activities to now accepting them by default and creating a regulatory environment for them to move forward.</p><p>And while altcoins and other development and products dependent on blockchains excluding Bitcoin still stand a chance to remain regulated and subjected to the directives of these incoming regulations, Bitcoin uniquely repels such regulations. </p><p>As a stakeholder in the African Bitcoin space, I must confess that consistent clarity from governments will not only help in driving adoption but will also create an enabling environment for Nigerians to incorporate decentralized blockchain technology, like Bitcoin, into scaling their businesses and ways of life, while opening numerous legal opportunities for everyone.</p><p>As the industry keeps shaping up, keep tabs on the space, as Nigeria President-Elect Bola Tinubu has promised <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/feed/post/292724">to enable the prudent use of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies in the nation's banking and financial sector</a>. My fingers remain crossed until we experience full implementation of Bitcoin-friendly regulations in Nigeria.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Heritage Falodun.

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Nozomi Hayase, Ph.D., who has a background in psychology and human development. </em><em>Disclaimer: Bitcoin 2023 and Bitcoin Magazine are both operated by BTC Inc.</em></p><p>With <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/april-inflation-breakdown-where-are-prices-rising-fastest">rising inflation</a> and a <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-regional-bank-crisis-did-not-appear-over-on-thursday-86a51703">growing number of bank failures</a>, the dysfunctional nature of the fiat system becomes more apparent day by day. In the midst of this chaos, Bitcoin enthusiasts are staying calm, even generally hopeful about their futures.</p><p>As public trust in institutions weakens, governments around the world are gearing up for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) as a means of reasserting their authority over peoples’ money. </p><p>“Thank God, we have Bitcoin!” </p><p>Those of us who are fortunate to have found it are relieved that Bitcoin exists. As Christine Lagarde, the head of the European Central Bank once <a href="https://twitter.com/Reuters/status/1349402076372209664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1349402076372209664%7Ctwgr%5E2ede5541109a2e3ad065ba3608b9dee15335fbe0%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinmagazine.com%2Fculture%2Fbitcoiner-optimism-saves-the-world">acknowledged</a>, Bitcoin is an escape hatch from the financial surveillance state.</p><p>Bitcoin, the hardest money ever created, presents a real alternative to both current fiat currencies and CBDCs. Now, those who so choose don’t have to go down the path leading toward a dystopian society. This might make us feel at ease. Some of you might think we can just HODL and maybe orange pill newcomers here and there, and simply wait for hyperbitcoinization. But I say, “Not quite yet. We can’t just sit back and relax.”</p><p>We Bitcoiners have important tasks ahead: Bitcoin's battle against the fraudulent banking system is far from over. It is really only just beginning.</p><h2>The Battle Is Beginning</h2><p>Bitcoin, over the 14 years <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_bitcoin">since its creation</a>, has been slowly unveiling its revolutionary potential. Bitcoin is a form of “digital gold” that cannot be confiscated. As a saving technology, it provides inflation proofing, allowing us to store value securely. Its core feature of censorship resistance has also helped it to gain popularity, since the importance of having “freedom money” has become clearer to political dissidents and the oppressed the world over.</p><p>Now that the COVID-19 pandemic has wound down, and the emergency has been declared over, global leaders aim to re-engineer the economy. <a href="https://www.weforum.org/great-reset">The initiatives</a> of the Great Reset <a href="https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_CBDC_Technology_Considerations_2021.pdf">plan to use CBDCs</a> as instruments of control, in the process creating a post-human society where human beings, as we have known them, cease to exist.</p><p>Things are moving fast. Commenting on the development of AI and its potential ramifications for humanity, Jordan Peterson, a prominent Canadian psychologist, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh0WQWACCDg">said</a>, “We better get our acts together before the giants show up. They are like knocking at the door right now.”</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qh0WQWACCDg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>Peterson has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh0WQWACCDg">talked about</a> how ChatGPT, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model">large language model (LLM)</a> and advanced conversational chatbot, is already building an increasingly-intelligent system. He described the process whereby, in the next few years, this AI model could extract a model of the world from the entire corpus of language, and use that to create a fully-rendered, photo-realistic animation indistinguishable from the image of a genuine person. By giving an example of turning a virtual girlfriend into a sex partner, he explained how easily it could falsify the representation of reality so completely that we all become confused about what is real and what is not.</p><p>And this technology is rapidly advancing. In March 2023, ChatGPT4, the most powerful artificial intelligence, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2023/03/28/gpt-4-released-what-it-means-for-the-future-of-your-business/?sh=147d3b612dc6">was released</a>. And Bitcoiners are in a unique position to take Peterson’s warning seriously and start doing something about the issues he has raised. </p><p>Bitcoin is pro-human technology. It provides a tool for us to detect counterfeit reality and which helps us to authenticate and secure truth, backed by our real human experiences.</p><p>Now, digitization of all aspects of society is taking place. From finance to healthcare and education, people are brought to the web to live their lives in a way that disconnects them from their bodies and from the natural environment. This trend leads to “hyper-mechanization,” a term I use to describe the turning point at which machines and robots become dominant in our world, dictating our very experiences. </p><p>This force of digitization, now becoming extreme, is also penetrating into the Bitcoin space. From Twitter to Nostr, and more than we are willing to admit, many of us are hooked to the iPhones and computers that keep us plugged into the matrix, becoming cut off from genuine, heart-to-heart interactions with other human beings.</p><p>As a machine-takeover of the world increasingly threatens the essence of what it means to be human, it is important for us to learn to unplug ourselves and maintain our relationships to ourselves and to nature. We need to collectively practice being offline from time to time, connecting with one another in real life. It is crucial for us to create a resilient human network of proof of work, built on top of the technology that can authenticate reality, based on our truly-felt feelings. </p><h2>Experiencing The Power Of Bitcoin, Firsthand</h2><p>This week, from May 18 to May 20, <a href="https://b.tc/conference/">the biggest Bitcoin conference</a> will take place in Miami Beach, Florida, bringing together Bitcoiners from all over the world. Along with presentations and panels from experts, professionals and leaders in the industry (check the speaker’s list <a href="https://b.tc/conference/speakers">here</a>), this three-day educational event will provide a space for Bitcoiners to gather outside of cyberspace and get to know one another.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/BTCBrunchMiami/status/1617234263501590532"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>From <a href="https://twitter.com/bitcoininmiami/status/1647786228459110400?s=43&amp;t=4-Zdlcfd6SKLkdflZIarcg">brunches</a> to <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/anders-pubby-toxic-happy-hour-pleb-party-miami-brought-to-you-by-swancom-tickets-478687135107?utm_campaign=bitcoin-2023&amp;utm_medium=dot-com&amp;utm_content=bitcoin_week_page">happy-hour pleb parties</a>, there will be plenty of opportunities for Bitcoiners to hang out. Through our exchanges of smiles and hugs, we can have firsthand experiences that demonstrate the power of bitcoin as the currency of love.</p><p>Crucially, the conference will also give us a chance to share our appreciation for artists who have been enriching the Bitcoin space. It will host <a href="https://b.tc/conference/art-gallery">an art gallery</a> displaying the work of more than 60 talented Bitcoin artists.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/Jethroe111/status/1651939821948903427"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/hitomi_matsui/status/1654655957597667329"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/13flr_escalator/status/1648688201668673544"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>There, attendees can meet and interact with these artists in person. Now that AI can whip out sophisticated images in a matter of seconds and mimic our creativity, it becomes vital for us to recognize the value of art created by real human beings who are inspired by their own visions, and engaged in a hard and honest labor of love. </p><p>During the first and second general attendance days of Bitcoin 2023 (on May 19 and 20, 2023), the exuberance of Bitcoin competition will be brought to the main exposition hall to ignite a spirit of collaboration and teamwork. Initiated as a community project, <a href="https://b.tc/conference/bitcoin-games">the Bitcoin Games</a> will provide a fun and joyful contest where local meetups can match their skills and talents to compete. The winning team will bring home the trophy and one full BTC, which can be used to help develop their community (check <a href="https://b.tc/conference/bitcoin-games">here</a> for the details).</p><p>From the <a href="https://b.tc/conference/bazaar">Bitcoin Bazaar</a>, a massive peer-to-peer marketplace, to <a href="https://b.tc/conference/after-party">the official after party</a>, lots of fun things will be happening throughout the week (check the full agenda <a href="https://b.tc/conference/agenda">here</a>). </p><p>Bitcoin is electronic cash backed by human ingenuity. But what powers Bitcoin is our passion and the values that are shared in our hearts. What good is free speech money, if there is no human being who can speak? What is the worth of life, if there is nobody who can feel and experience its fullness?</p><p>At Bitcoin 2023, Bitcoiners around the world can come together to work toward hyperbitcoinization, in order to preserve what defines us uniquely as human beings. It presents a festival of humanity. </p><p>“Tick tock, next block.” </p><p>The countdown has just begun. It’s time to amplify relentless optimism and celebrate the beauty and magnificence that we all are. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Nozomi Hayase.

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Robert Hall, a content creator and small business owner.</em></p><p>If you follow U.S. politics, you understand that the country is <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12061031/Where-Biden-Republicans-stand-debt-limit-ahead-Big-Four-meeting.html">on the brink of defaulting on its massive $31 trillion debt</a>. </p><p>At the crux of the issue is that there are<a href="https://pressgallery.house.gov/member-data/party-breakdown"> </a>Republicans in one corner, who control the House of Representatives <a href="https://pressgallery.house.gov/member-data/party-breakdown">with a slim 222 to 213 majority.</a> In the other corner, the <a href="https://about.bgov.com/brief/balance-of-power-a-partisan-convergence-in-the-senate/">U.S. Senate</a> and the White House, under Joe Biden, are controlled by Democrats.</p><p>Both parties are diametrically opposed to what the other wants. Republicans want to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/gops-debt-ceiling-proposal-where-do-republicans-want-to-cut-spending-366a29b6">significantly cut spending</a> in order to raise the debt limit for a year. Democrats want <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/172376/debt-ceiling-deadline-default-negotiations">a “clean” debt ceiling bill passed without strings attached</a>. As you can see, both parties’ starting positions are nowhere near each other. Ultimately, this has turned into a game of chicken based on who will blink first. It’s all very tiring.</p><p>Is this the way a government should be run? It is absolutely crazy that these leaders would risk defaulting on money that has already been spent. This is like if you or I whipped out a credit card, went crazy buying all kinds of stuff, and did not make the monthly payment at the end of the month.</p><p>The government has been able to run up the debt for a long time because it has had willing participants, such as pension funds, hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds and regular joes who lent them money by buying treasury bills because they believed they would be paid back with interest.</p><p>This has been the case for a long time, but now this arrangement is being called into question with the will they, won’t they bull going on in Congress right now. </p><h2>Seriously Broke</h2><p>Are these politicians so detached from reality to think that, once the debt limit is breached and people stop getting paid what is owed to them, people will go right back to loaning them money?</p><p>If they do, they will demand even higher interest rates. The government can’t even afford the rates we have now! What happens if the borrowing cost for the government goes to 10% or 15%? Ain’t nothing getting funded; I can tell you that much.</p><p><a href="https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2023/02/interest-costs-on-the-national-debt-are-on-track-to-reach-a-record-high">Check out this</a>:<a href="https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2023/02/interest-costs-on-the-national-debt-are-on-track-to-reach-a-record-high"> </a>The federal government spent a record $475 billion on interest payments in fiscal year 2022. Interest costs grew 30% last year and are poised to jump another 35% this year, according to the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO’s) own estimate!</p><p>The CBO believes the federal government will spend $640 billion in interest payments this year alone. Is this the<a href="https://jameslavish.substack.com/p/-whats-a-debt-spiral-and-is-the-us"> debt spiral that James Lavish</a> has been talking about lately? It sure as hell seems like it to me.</p><p>We are on a slow-motion collision course with the economic reality that you can’t print and borrow money without consequences. Inflation rears its ugly head first, and then people realize the money they are being paid back with has diminished purchasing power. Once people know they are losing money when they lend it to the federal government, it’s game over.</p><p>This debt-ceiling debate will highlight the dysfunction of the federal government and its inability to keep its promises. This is what surprises me about the politicians on both sides of the aisle.</p><p>Do they really want to show this level of incompetence to the world? It’s like watching your family fight in the front yard. It’s embarrassing as hell and will change the perception that your neighbors have about your family.</p><p>A debt default will change the perception of the U.S. from a trusted payer to a debt junkie unable to pay its debts.</p><h2>How Is Default Good For Bitcoin?</h2><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3ODUyMTkyMTY0NTUzOTAw/bitcoin-dollar.jpg" height="411" width="620">

    </figure><p>The silver lining to this whole debt-ceiling debacle is that it’s going to throw rocket fuel on the price of bitcoin. As people see that their money is no longer “safe” with the federal government, they will seek an alternative to U.S. treasuries. Undoubtedly, some of the dollars that would have been earmarked for treasuries will flow into bitcoin.</p><p>New entrants to bitcoin will see that it is the safe haven asset they were looking for the whole time. There is no counterparty risk, and the supply can’t be diluted.</p><p>During the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_United_States_debt-ceiling_crisis#:~:text=It%20began%20in%20January%202013,following%20the%20crisis%20in%202011.">last contentious debate over the debt ceiling</a>, under the Obama administration, the price of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/bitcoin-price-history">bitcoin went from $13 and ended the year at $755.</a> It also reached an all-time high of $1,163 that year. Coincidence? Maybe, but it does make sense for people to protect their wealth during times of potential calamity such as a default. </p><p>So, I say to the politicians running the government right now: Go ahead and keep playing these games. Default or don’t default because, in the end, it doesn’t matter; you still lose. You have led the world to ruin, and it will be up to Bitcoin to save humanity from itself. The debt-ceiling debacle only accelerates the inevitable.</p><p>And to the Bitcoiners: Keep stacking them sats like your lives depend on it, because one day they might. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Robert Hall.

I would estimate that 80% to 90% of the people I’ve met in the Bitcoin space are men. </p><p>This is a problem.</p><p>Women have the power to shape the future leaders of this world through their intimate bonds with their children. A baby who is born this year may enter adulthood in a world where fiat currency is a thing of the past, and bitcoin is the global, digital currency. </p><p>This timeline, however, will not be possible without having the buy-in of more women.</p><p>In this article, I will discuss what I’ve observed and make some recommendations on how to effectively introduce Bitcoin to more women.</p><h2>Facts Vs. Stories</h2><p>If you asked my husband what he thought about the state of the economy, he would immediately spout out facts about how our market is not free and how the government picks winners and losers. He would go on about zombie companies, malinvestment, how much the Federal Reserve inflates the money supply and how the chairman manipulates the interest rate, etc. </p><p>If you asked me the same question, on the other hand, I would talk about some of our elderly neighbors, and go into great detail about a recent conversation I had with a retired grandmother: Standing in the hot sun next to squawking hens as they pecked loudly and aggressively at their food, we discussed the challenges of protecting our chickens from predators and growing a garden, even though neither of us was passionate about farming. </p><p>(I can feel some of you getting impatient with me as you’re reading this. <em>Get to the point, why don’t you? What does this have to do with the question?</em> Well, hold on, I’m getting there!) </p><p>We chatted at length about prices going up and how raising chickens and growing gardens were our ways of hedging against crazy price increases at the grocery store. I would then tell you that she and her husband are on a fixed income and about her worry that, with the way things are going, one day soon she won’t be able to buy enough groceries to keep from going hungry.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>In my mind, this is what the “state of our economy” means — the peoples’ stories. And in the presence of men, despite them being friendly, welcoming and very encouraging, I still feel pressure to cut out details and “get to the point.” On the other hand, in the presence of women, telling peoples’ stories often feels natural and easy because that’s the way many women hash out important topics.</p><p>This is a major difference between men and women: men typically get to the facts, and women tell stories. </p><h2>Cigars And Whisky Vs. Tea And Biscuits</h2><p>My husband and I have <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/parallels-between-homeschool-and-bitcoin">been on a mission to bring Bitcoin education to homeschoolers</a>. In all of the conversations we’ve had, our experience has been that 90% of the women say the same thing: “I don’t understand Bitcoin, I don’t think I can figure it out. My husband handles the finances and investment decisions.”</p><p>Why would women, who are equally as educated and intelligent as their spouses, leave this vitally important knowledge solely to the care of men? Dare I say that this is because Bitcoin educational materials and learning environments tend to lean heavily toward the way men communicate? </p><p>Perhaps we need a women-to-women approach. Please don't misunderstand me; I am not saying that women are incapable of understanding technical and factual information in the same way that men are. Both genders are equally capable. However, in our pursuit of equality, we must not lose sight of the fact that men and women differ not only biologically but also in the way they perceive and interact with the world.</p><p>When men gather, they can often exchange quick pleasantries and get right down to business. At the end of such a meeting, everyone feels satisfied. Most women in the same scenarios, however, would not feel satisfied. We need to visit first, ask about one another's weeks, how the kids are doing and any challenges that we have faced during the week. We exchange stories and empathize to show that we care. To quote the famed sales guru <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/863418-people-don-t-care-how-much-you-know-until-they-know">Zig Ziglar</a>, “People don't care how much you know until they know how much you care.” </p><p>Are we not all salespeople trying to sell the idea of Bitcoin? Maybe we can take a page out of Ziglar's book.</p><h2>Why Vs. What</h2><p>When I first tried to read up on Bitcoin because of my husband’s insistent nudging, I found it exceptionally frustrating. There are many books on the market, numerous podcasts and a plethora of YouTube videos explaining Bitcoin. However, until I understood why Bitcoin is important to me personally, I would rather have done something else with my precious free time. </p><p>Charts and graphs and angry rants about the political landscape or the corrupt system wouldn’t convince me. Although these issues annoy me, I mostly chalk them up to things I can’t do anything about. My schedule is already full of more things to do than the time to do them. However, if you tell me a human story about someone facing hardship and difficult consequences due to the fallacies of our monetary system, then my anger at the injustice would propel me to do the necessary research and learn about how bitcoin is an alternative currency, not just a risky speculation or possibly a wild gamble.</p><p>To reach women en masse, we’ve got to focus on telling good stories about the “why” of Bitcoin.</p><p>It is not my intention to suggest that men and women Bitcoiners cannot benefit from the same meetups or education materials. Our society is currently obsessed with labeling everyone with some obscure name that separates them from each other. I don’t want to play that game. I am suggesting that if we are mindful of the audience we are trying to reach, perhaps we could craft our message differently to get our point across more successfully.</p><p>Here's an example of how women perceive men talking about the why of Bitcoin — my niece drew the following comic strip to highlight what she had learned after listening to a Bitcoin podcast:</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NzEzMjQxOTE5NDY1MjY2/bitcoin-podcasts.png" height="520" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>I wonder how different the comic strip would have looked if two women had done the podcast, even if they had discussed exactly the same topics and come to the same conclusions as the hosts of the podcast that my niece listened to.</p><p>Here are some suggestions based on my personal experiences in reaching precoiner women:</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NzEzMjQxOTE5NTMwODAy/mama-bear.png" height="520" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><h2>One: Anger Mama Bear! </h2><p>Tell personal stories to share the <em>why</em> of Bitcoin. Following the story I shared earlier in this article about elderly retirees, most people would feel sympathetic toward them having to work in the hot sun day after day to grow their own food. But if you explained to a young mother who is lovingly and protectively cradling her newborn baby against her chest that the impending hyperinflation means her child would grow up to be in the same situation, having to literally labor in the field for food, you will have incited the most powerful force on earth: a mother’s instinct to protect her young. Now you’ll have a motivated individual who is ready to do whatever it takes to learn about this crazy thing called Bitcoin.</p><h2>Two: Host Women’s Events </h2><p>Remember that book “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Men-Mars-Women-Venus-Understanding/dp/0060574216">Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus</a>”? </p><p>We need to embrace who we are. Being different is good, just as specialization is a positive force in truly free<em> </em>markets. Marketing a new and mysterious idea like Bitcoin can only be effective with customized messaging and delivery methods to reach different target audiences. </p><p>Recognize that women and men socialize differently and feel comfortable in different environments. When women talk to women, we have more freedom to express ourselves with an ease that is not as readily available in a co-ed gathering. This is not to say that men and women cannot speak to one another, but simply that certain conversations can feel more comfortable woman to woman. </p><h2>Three: Less Is More </h2><p>Don’t vomit facts and charts and numbers at a woman precoiner. You can’t “logic” women into Bitcoin. You have to emotionally persuade women into Bitcoin. Ask questions about their lives and concerns and let them have enough time to fully share. </p><p>Talking less is actually more persuasive than talking more. Allow the conversation to naturally develop to the point where they ask the first questions. That’s when you know the floor is yours. Share in small bits. Keep a low-time-preference mentality.</p><p>I hope this article helps men Bitcoiners to communicate more effectively with women and finds its way to women Bitcoiners who are willing to work together to reach other women in a way that only we can: woman to woman. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Tali Lindberg.

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Robert Hall, </em><em>a content creator and small business owner.</em></p><p>The race for the 2024 U.S. presidential election is starting to kick into gear, featuring some of the same cast of characters from the last few elections. On the Democratic side, you have <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/04/25/1145679856/biden-president-announcement-2024-running-reelection">Joe Biden</a>,<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/robert-f-kennedy-jr-2024-presidential-election-campaign-announcement/"> Robert F. Kennedy</a> and<a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/democrat-marianne-williamson-announces-2024-presidential-run"> Marianne Williamson</a> suggesting they will run. Then, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2024_presidential_campaign">Former President Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley_2024_presidential_campaign">Nikki Haley</a>, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/ron-desantis-set-jump-2024-presidential-fray-may-rcna81666">Ron DeSantis</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivek_Ramaswamy_2024_presidential_campaign">Vivek Ramaswamy</a> are on the other side of the aisle.</p><p>If you have been following the race so far, you might know that Trump <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/2024-presidential-primary-trump-v-trump-fatigue-poll-2023-05-01/">seems to be walking away with the nomination</a> before the process even starts next year. If he ends up being the nominee, we will likely get a re-run of 2020, where we have two men over 70 years old who both think that they know what is right for the country. Who else is tired of having baby boomers running the show? I am, to be honest.</p><h2>Boomer Presidents Don’t Understand Bitcoin</h2><p>Baby boomers, you’ve had their time in the sun. It’s time to leave the stage and let the younger generations of leaders have a chance to lead the country. We need leaders who understand the emerging challenges facing America as we speak.</p><p>We need leaders who thoroughly understand economic policy and the value of innovation in the financial space. For instance, the baby boomers at the top of the ticket don’t have the depth or the capacity to understand the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that Bitcoin presents to America and the American people.</p><p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2022/01/28/president-joe-biden-is-going-after-bitcoin-cryptocurrencies-and-nfts/?sh=15a93c757b9a">Biden</a> and <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3408900/trumps-hostile-view-of-bitcoin-and-crypto-could-chill-industry.html">Trump</a> have been openly hostile towards Bitcoin because they believe in the supremacy of the fiat dollar system. The time is now to elect someone with a bold vision for the future, who understands that the way that the entitlement systems are set up and the dollar's role in the world isn’t sustainable over the long term.</p><p>If America stays on its current path, it will only lead to chaos, lawlessness, and a lower standard of living for everyone. Is this the future that you want for your children and grandchildren? 2024 is our chance to start a new journey toward freedom, the rule of law and the opportunity to make something of yourself, regardless of your station in life.</p><h2>Why We Need A Bitcoiner As President</h2><p>It has been reported recently that the mayor of Miami, Francis Suarez,<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/3960935-miami-mayor-close-to-decision-on-2024-gop-presidential-bid/"> is close to a decision on whether to run for president next year</a>. For those who don’t know him, he is <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/francis-suarez">one of the most pro-Bitcoin politicians in the country</a>. He has actively courted Bitcoiners to come to Miami and help make it the Bitcoin capital of the world. So far, he has largely succeeded in doing that.</p><p>But in addition to making the U.S. an epicenter for Bitcoin innovation, having a Bitcoiner like Suarez as president will, critically, stop the emergence of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in America dead in its tracks. If Biden or Trump is elected, it is almost certain that some form of CBDC will be activated in America. With the deployment of a CBDC, you can kiss your financial freedom goodbye. You can kiss your privacy goodbye.</p><p>You will no longer have autonomy over what you can eat or how far you can travel. You will have a social credit score, <a href="https://velocityglobal.com/blog/chinese-social-credit-system/#:~:text=China's%20social%20credit%20system%20gives,credit%20and%20fewer%20business%20opportunities.">as has been implemented in China</a>. Is this the type of life that you want? We have to strive for a better life. </p><p>Just recently, the rails for a CBDC were introduced to the public.<a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3693256/fed-s-zelle-like-instant-payment-system-to-go-live-in-july-hundreds-now-testing.html"> </a>FedNow, as it is called, <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3693256/fed-s-zelle-like-instant-payment-system-to-go-live-in-july-hundreds-now-testing.html">will be operational by July 2023.</a> It is said that it will be used to speed up payments between customers and businesses, which may be accurate at the moment. However, as with any system, it will likely evolve into something vastly different than what it was intended to be.</p><p>Can we really trust a government that has given us the<a href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/national-security/privacy-and-surveillance/surveillance-under-patriot-act"> Patriot Act</a>,<a href="https://www.cloudwards.net/prism-snowden-and-government-surveillance/"> PRISM</a> and now the proposed<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/04/broad-vague-restrict-act-dangerous-substitute-comprehensive-data-privacy"> RESTRICT Act</a> to resist total control over what you spend your money on?</p><p>The RESTRICT Act, for instance, put forth by none other than <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/02/14/elizabeth-warren-anti-crypto-ftx-00082624">Bitcoin-hating Senator Elizabeth Warren</a>, has the potential to harm Bitcoiners in the United States with its overly-broad language about digital communication tools being a threat to national security. While the overt target may be TikTok, nothing is stopping regulators from using this law against Bitcoin in the future.</p><p>Looking past this smokescreen, you can see that they are building their case to the public: <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/hillary-clinton-says-cryptocurrency-destabilize-nations-2021-11">Hilary Clinton</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/after-ftx-collapse-pressure-builds-tougher-crypto-rules-2022-12-02/">international regulators</a> and the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-treasury-warns-defi-being-200515406.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHro6hwDAeWGZk2LcXCSxoM5mIJu8Gk8X1q9_NyN451C1t-QqL_KRE7pkrk2NnlqmckDN-rhenF6ePW3yXcFWoAAuDnRaJaXESwHKYsieMc0ue0s1_6dc3_0Srjc6fweVc9diJcm0lrZS5azqW4bgjER2tvbykCfUYvGvKyWFFCJ">U.S. Treasury</a> have all warned about the dangers of cryptocurrency.</p><p>Now, put this in the context of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/interactive/2023/national-debt-31-trillion/">$31 trillion in U.S. national debt</a>, unsustainable entitlement spending, a world slowly moving away from the dollar, high gas prices and uncontrollable inflation. Then it becomes clear that they will close off the exits to Bitcoin before most people learn about how to use them. They want to herd the masses into a CBDC for a “great reset” of the monetary system. This is coming if we don’t start electing people who understand that Bitcoin is our last chance to escape a sinking ship.</p><p>Mayor Saurez gets it, and if any other politicians in America understand Bitcoin, it is time that we support them and get more Bitcoiners in office. The dollar is the Titanic, and Bitcoin is the lifeboat. Will enough people get on to be saved? Time will tell and the upcoming presidential election could be a final chance.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Robert Hall.

    </figure><p>U.S. Congressman Brad Sherman has sent a letter to Gary Gensler, Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), regarding the situation of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/BradSherman/status/1656783945155899396"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p><a href="https://twitter.com/BradSherman/status/1656783945155899396?s=20">According to Sherman</a>, as many as 850,000 retail investors, including some who used individual retirement account funds, are currently trapped in their GBTC investments due to the actions of GBTC and its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG). Sherman estimates that these investors' retirement security and in some cases, their life savings, may be at risk and that if the situation is not remedied, they could lose tens of billions of dollars of their savings.</p><p>Sherman's concerns regarding GBTC stem from the fact that GBTC shares currently trade at a <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/potential-paths-forward-for-gbtc">~42% discount</a> to the bitcoins in the trust, and Grayscale has refused to redeem GBTC shares, citing Regulation M's prohibition on simultaneous sales and redemptions of the same security. Grayscale's Head of Investor Relations, Rayhanch Sharif-Askary, admitted that the company's flooding of the market with GBTC by continuously issuing new shares between 2018 and 2021 drove the discount to its net asset value.</p><p>Sherman alleges that Grayscale's actions are motivated by a desire to increase assets under management, regardless of the impact on GBTC's retail investors. Grayscale charges users an annual 2% fee based on the actual value of bitcoin, not the value of the GBTC that investors own. By charging more than four times what their competitors charge, Grayscale was able to bring in $615 million in fees alone in 2021, according to the letter.</p><p>Sherman has posed several questions to the SEC related to this matter, including whether Regulation M is a barrier to allowing shareholder redemptions today, whether the SEC is aware of other specific rules and regulations that are a barrier to allowing shareholder redemptions today, and whether it is a matter of concern that Grayscale does not have a single independent director on either its board of directors or audit committee.</p><p>In conclusion, Congressman Brad Sherman's letter to the SEC Chair, Gary Gensler, is raising concerns over the situation of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). Sherman is worried that as many as 850,000 retail investors could lose their retirement security and savings, as they are currently trapped in their GBTC investment due to the actions of GBTC and its parent company, Digital Currency Group. At Bitcoin 2023 in Miami, there will be a <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/industry-events/reedemgbtc-com-to-host-shareholders-meetup-at-miami-bitcoin-conference">shareholders meetup</a> to discuss the next steps that concerned shareholders can take. This aims to be the largest gathering of shareholders since the beginning of the Trust, with more than 30% of shareholders expected to attend.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MjMxNzYxODMwNTUzMDkz/bitcoin-stack.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[This Mother’s Day, Try Explaining Bitcoin To Your Mom]]></title><description><![CDATA[If your mom has a hard time getting off zero, like this author’s does, you should give it another shot on Mother’s Day.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/give-bitcoin-for-mothers-day</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/give-bitcoin-for-mothers-day</guid><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Orange Pill]]></category><category><![CDATA[Holiday]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Family]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Hector Alvero]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 12 May 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwNDI4MzgyNTMyNTQ0NDEw/114-btc.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

    </figure><p>As Bitcoiners, we love the exhilarating feeling of bringing a new person into the Bitcoin lifeboat. Many of us constantly work to orange pill our friends, our coworkers and our neighbors, trying to save as many as we can before the fiat ship sinks. We'll even try to orange pill the waiter at our favorite local restaurant, helping them download a Lightning wallet and offering to give them a bigger tip to help them "get off zero."</p><p>But what about your mom? Have you given her the same gift that you’ve given to the Uber driver who took you home from your last conference or meetup? Have you taken the time to help her understand the impact that inflation is having on her economic security, and how Bitcoin can protect her from the financial earthquake that is coming? Have you helped her understand what money is and why Bitcoin is the greatest savings technology ever discovered? </p><p>If you have, I applaud you. If you haven't gotten there yet, this Mother's Day is the perfect time to show her that you love her enough to spend the time it takes for her to understand Bitcoin.</p><p>You might be thinking, "I already tried, and she didn't get it." I can sympathize with that. My mom didn't get it right away, either. She said it sounded like a Ponzi scheme and that it couldn't be money because it wasn't real or backed by anything. </p><p>Maybe you have heard some of these same objections. Maybe you are frustrated and figure you should just let it go. If so, ask yourself this question: How many times has your mom explained something to you that you didn't understand at first? She likely did not just give up on helping you learn and grow. Are you going to quit on her now when her entire future is at stake? Of course not… you're a Bitcoiner.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Think back to when you first heard about Bitcoin. Did you get it right away? I didn't. A friend told me about Bitcoin at a Halloween party in 2015, and while I didn't dismiss it, I certainly did not understand its importance at first. Life was busy, and so I forgot about it for about a year until he tried again in late 2016 and helped me learn enough to buy a small amount and begin my journey. Maybe you have a similar story of someone who kept trying until you understood this revolutionary technology enough to take your first step on the path to economic freedom and sovereignty. Imagine how different your outlook on the future would be if they had not kept trying.</p><p>Remember, Bitcoin is hard to grok. It was for me, and maybe it was for you, too. It is also generally harder to understand the older someone is because they have lived in their economic circumstances for longer than a younger person has, and are often more reluctant to accept a new paradigm. Change can be scary, especially for someone that might be feeling confused about why the world seems to be spinning out of control. It might take more patience. It might take a few more conversations or the breaking up of big topics into smaller ones before the light bulb goes on for your mom. Try to find something she can relate to that Bitcoin fixes and focus on that aspect alone. Relevance is a powerful tool for persuasion.</p><h2>Break Up Bitcoin Topics For Your Mom</h2><figure>

    </figure><p>For my mom, what made the light bulb go on in her head was when I related one piece of Bitcoin’s value proposition to something she understood from her own life. In her case, it was Bitcoin’s resistance to censorship and confiscation. </p><p>My mom grew up in Cuba and was a teenager when Fidel Castro <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidel_Castro_in_the_Cuban_Revolution">rose to power in the late 1950s</a>. She remembers how her family’s meager cash savings, which my grandfather kept in a glass jar hidden in the house, was demonetized when the new regime took power. My grandfather refused to turn in the money and buried the jar in the backyard. He trusted that eventually, everything would go back to how it was before and the old currency would be accepted again. </p><p>This never happened, and my grandparents had to flee the island with my mom soon after. They also had to leave behind the valueless pieces of paper buried in the backyard of the house, which they also no longer owned thanks to the new government’s abolition of private property rights.</p><p>They lost the money, the house and they barely escaped with their lives. When I talked with her about Bitcoin in terms of it being property that no one can take from her, she got it.</p><h2>Give The Gift Of Bitcoin This Mother’s Day</h2><p>This Mother's Day, I encourage you to consider trying again. Try again like your mom encouraged you to do when she taught you to ride a bike, trying again even when you kept falling. Try again like my mom did when teaching me to parallel park, even after I ran over the garbage can… twice. </p><p>She never gave up on you, and now it is your turn to believe in her and return the favor. Now is the moment when you can show her that those lessons of persistence, patience and love took hold. This Mother’s Day is your chance to save her life and future, and to repay her for giving both of those things to you.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is facing criticism from the United States Chamber of Commerce over its lack of clarity regarding which digital assets are securities under federal law. This issue has “immense implications for every person involved in the $1 trillion digital-asset economy,” a <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/assets/documents/U.S.-Chamber-Amicus-Brief-In-re-Coinbase-Third-Circuit.pdf">court filing</a> by the Chamber states.</p><p>According to the filing, the SEC has refused to engage in any systematic process or rulemaking to explain what its claimed authority means, instead offering one-off enforcement actions and public speeches. This has created regulatory uncertainty and destabilized the regulatory environment for digital assets.</p><p>In July 2022, Coinbase <a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2022/petn4-789.pdf">petitioned</a> the SEC to initiate a rulemaking regarding digital-asset securities. It urged the Commission to answer basic questions such as "which digital assets are securities?" More than 1,700 commenters echoed Coinbase's call, but the SEC expressed no interest in addressing Coinbase's request, according to the Chamber. Coinbase then <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/coinbase-files-lawsuit-against-sec-seeking-regulatory-clarity">pursued a lawsuit</a> against the SEC in order to compel the regulator into action, which is where the filing by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce comes from. </p><p>The SEC's Chairman has asserted that the securities laws are unambiguous as applied to blockchain-based digital assets. Despite constructively denying Coinbase's petition, the SEC has refused to memorialize its decision in a formal response.</p><p>According to the Chamber, the SEC's lack of clarity has caused economic harm to both Coinbase and the broader business community. The uncertainty deters productive conduct and stifles innovation and undermines broader American economic and strategic interests. Continued uncertainty also has implications for the nation's geopolitical interests and the continued primacy of the dollar, given the increasing relevance of digital assets to international monetary policy.</p><p>The SEC's refusal to engage in rulemaking or respond to Coinbase's rulemaking petition has destabilized the regulatory environment for digital assets, the Chamber states. </p><p>“Agencies ordinarily provide regulatory clarity by promulgating rules of general applicability,” the filing says. “This preference for rulemaking has important benefits: It forces agencies to put to paper their regulatory plans, and it provides for fixed, prospective effective dates that ensure parties can bring their conduct into conformance with the law rather than be held liable later for violating duties they did not know existed.”</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwMjY2NTkxMzgyODczMjQx/bitcoin-lightning-network.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Marathon Digital Holdings Faces Second Subpoena By SEC In Relation To Montana Mining Operation]]></title><description><![CDATA[According to a quarterly filing by the miner, the SEC is still inquiring about a Montana mining operation previously investigated in 2021.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/marathon-digital-holdings-faces-second-subpoena-by-sec</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/marathon-digital-holdings-faces-second-subpoena-by-sec</guid><category><![CDATA[SEC]]></category><category><![CDATA[Marathon Digital Holdings]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Public Miners]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[Regulation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 11 May 2023 18:35:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MzI5NzY4OTU4MTc0ODk3/bitcoin-legal-regulation.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Marathon Digital Holdings, a public Bitcoin miner, has received another subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding whether there were possible violations of federal securities law in agreements related to a Hardin, Montana data center facility that Marathon built.&nbsp;</p><p>“The Company and certain of its executives received a subpoena to produce documents and communications,” related to the facility in the third quarter of 2021, a <a href="https://ir.marathondh.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001493152-23-016184/0001493152-23-016184.pdf">quarterly filing</a> by the company stated. </p><p>In that agreement, Marathon issued 6,000,000 shares of restricted Common Stock, “in transactions exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933.” However, the company filing revealed that it recently received another subpoena from the SEC on April 10, 2023, “relating to, among other things, transactions with related parties." <br><br>The company says it is cooperating with the investigation.

    </figure><p>“One of the many ways that Bitcoin is an experiment is in its decentralized development model,” explained Amiti Uttarwar. “Whether a non-profit or a private company, the vast majority of software projects have a centralized structure for directing funding, prioritizing projects and coordinating efforts. But the community consensus model of Bitcoin is essential for ongoing censorship resistance. While it’s not easy to get tens of thousands of individual computers to agree, getting thousands of humans to agree is arguably the greater challenge.”</p><p>As a Bitcoin Core developer, Uttarwar is understandably fascinated with Bitcoin’s unique consensus model. She opted to focus on this community-led, open-source project full time in 2019, taking a significant pay cut from an engineering role with Coinbase, and has since earned grants to continue her work from <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/okcoin-bitmex-operator-grant-150000-to-core-developer-amiti-uttarwar">OKCoin, BitMEX operator HDR Global</a> and <a href="https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-to-sponsor-bitcoin-core-developer-amiti-uttarwar">Gemini</a>. </p><p>Her past codebase contributions have <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22950">changed the logic of Bitcoin’s address management</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21528">fundamentally shifted address communication</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18038">reduced privacy leaks caused by transaction broadcasting</a>. Today, her development focus is on improving support for privacy-enhancing communication layers like Tor, I2P and CJDNS through a collaboration with Chaincode Labs’ <a href="https://twitter.com/lightlike1?lang=en">Martin Zumsande</a>.</p><p>“While Bitcoin users can run nodes on multiple networks right now, the benefits are limited and often require a deep level of understanding from the node operator,” Uttarwar said. “Our current project is to enable automatic connections to nodes on every network that a user has enabled. With our work, if a user has enabled clearnet (with interfaces IPv4 or IPv6) and Tor on their Bitcoin node, the node will strive to ensure at least one of their 10 outbound connections is to an onion peer on the Tor network.” </p><p>For Uttarwar, who has seen her work merged into a Bitcoin Core update and who depends upon the larger community of Bitcoin developers for feedback and critical review of her work, the decentralization that underpins this software project is more than just a development model, it is a responsibility.</p><p>“Honoring decentralization in the world of Bitcoin development requires participation from Bitcoin users at varying levels of expertise,” she said. “For example, a protocol upgrade can only happen if users all over the world decide to adopt the code and activate the new logic... The question of what makes Bitcoin better evokes strong opinions in the community, but whether advocating for ossification or soft-fork methodology, funding developers or selecting maintainers, the question that underpins all of these conversations is: How do we agree on what Bitcoin needs in a decentralized way?”</p><p>Exploring this existential question will be Uttarwar’s focus at the upcoming Bitcoin 2023 conference, where she is <a href="https://b.tc/conference/agenda">set to deliver a keynote</a> titled “Decentralization In Action.” Rather than advocating for a particular Bitcoin project, use case or implication, Uttarwar will be using this spotlight to grapple with the very nature of organizational systems and the unique value of Bitcoin development in their context.</p><p>“My talk begins with an epistemological lens, identifying meaningful mental models by taking a look at the world around us,” she described. “By starting with these examples, I encourage the audience to broaden their understanding of how decentralization works in practice. The rest of the talk relates these questions back to daily challenges in the ecosystem of Bitcoin builders. Bitcoin relies on nodes running code around the world to ensure censorship resistance on the network. Upholding this goal also requires a decentralized model of development — the community needs to ensure that making changes to the code is not vulnerable to a single point of failure.”</p><p>She will also participate in a panel discussion alongside Bitcoin Magazine’s <a href="https://twitter.com/AaronvanW">Aaron van Wirdum</a>, Judica Founder <a href="https://twitter.com/JeremyRubin">Jeremy Rubin</a> and Lightning Network Developer <a href="https://twitter.com/tdryja">Tadge Dryja</a> called “Evolving Bitcoin’s Code” to further explore when and how changes can be successfully made to Bitcoin’s underlying software.</p><p>Uttarwar sees Bitcoin 2023 as a chance to advocate for the work that she and the rest of the Bitcoin development community are doing every day, reinforcing what decentralization really means for all of us who enjoy the tools built on top of this technology.</p><p>“At Bitcoin 2023, I aim to encourage people to develop a richer understanding of the complexity of what it means to build a truly decentralized technology, and how the success of Bitcoin relies on the individuals within the community contributing their unique attention,” she concluded. “I look forward to getting a pulse of the greater community, learning more about what excites people as well as current pain points. I’m also excited to connect with different people and discover corners of conversation that reinforce my excitement for this space.”</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTc5Mjk3Nzg1MjcwNzA3OTA3/okcoin-bitmex-grant-150000-to-bitcoin-core-developer.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[With The E-Krona, Sweden Is Attacking The Virtues Bitcoin Is Built To Protect]]></title><description><![CDATA[As they increase financial surveillance and control, Swiss authorities are inadvertently making the case for Bitcoin as an alternative.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/sweden-cbdc-for-financial-surveillance</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/sweden-cbdc-for-financial-surveillance</guid><category><![CDATA[cbdc]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Surveillance]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sweden]]></category><category><![CDATA[central bank]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Peter Bistoletti]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 11 May 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwODQ5NjE5NzcxNTMyODgx/blockchain-surveillance.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

Sweden has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-03-01/the-cashless-economy-sweden-s-switch-to-digital-tells-a-cautionary-tale#xj4y7vzkg">almost completely abolished anonymous cash transactions</a> and, as a result, its regulators have control of all financial assets. Since at least 1971, when I moved to Sweden, bank assets have to be reported annually to the tax authorities, which can also demand documentation for all bank transactions. Since 2020, <a href="https://edri.org/our-work/swedish-law-enforcement-given-the-permission-to-hack/">the Swedish police have the right by law to acquire access to locked iphones and computers by use of force</a>. </p><p>In such a privacy-averse environment, one should consider Bitcoin as a better alternative. </p><h2>Introducing The E-Krona</h2><p>In the early days of Bitcoin, one could buy BTC anonymously through platforms such as LocalBitcoins, which is impossible today. To buy BTC through the majority of accessible platforms now, one has to follow strict KYC and AML regulations. Sweden <a href="https://coinatmradar.com/country/205/bitcoin-atm-sweden/#:~:text=Total%20number%20of%20Bitcoin%20ATMs%20%2F%20Tellers%20in%20Sweden%3A%200">also has no Bitcoin ATMs</a>. Swedish banks, politicians and the media have an overwhelmingly hostile attitude towards BTC.</p><p>Sweden is now moving toward a central-bank-issued, digital, national currency. <a href="https://www.riksbank.se/globalassets/media/rapporter/e-krona/2017/rapport_ekrona_uppdaterad_170920_eng.pdf">Since 2017</a>, the Swedish central bank, Sveriges Riksbank, <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/">the issuer</a> of the prize in economic science in memory of Alfred Nobel, has been promoting the e-krona as a complement to, or replacement of, physical cash. Proponents of e-krona argue that it prevents money laundering and criminal activities, speeds up the financial system and finetunes financial and monetary activities. Critics argue that it is the ultimate tool for financial censorship, control and surveillance. The development of e-krona is happening in <a href="https://www.riksbank.se/globalassets/media/rapporter/e-krona/2023/e-krona-pilot-phase-3.pdf">cooperation with other central banks</a> and the Bank For International Settlements (BIS).</p><p>E-krona is, at present, a pilot project, testing the technical platform and the cooperation of banks, companies and end users. The e-krona will preserve several functions of cash but <em>not</em> anonymity. The volume of e-krona created will <em>not</em> be determined by mining (like it is for Bitcoin), but by the central bank. Positive or negative interest rates will also be determined by the central bank. In a deeper sense, the e-krona without a function like Bitcoin mining is merely a central database controlled by the central bank. </p><h2>Designed To Limit Freedom</h2><p>The technical underpinnings for the e-krona are based on a form of blockchain technology through <a href="https://www.riksbank.se/globalassets/media/rapporter/e-krona/2022/e-krona-pilot-phase-2.pdf">the Corda platform, developed by the software company R3, and ran a February 2020 technical pilot project in cooperation with Accenture</a>, a large, global tech company. The e-krona is programmable and only the central bank can create and destroy e-krona, which is distributed via banks to the general public. The end user can exchange e-krona with bank money in an account and can execute and accept transactions. </p><p><a href="https://www.riksbank.se/en-gb/payments--cash/e-krona/technical-solution-for-the-e-krona-pilot/">There will be</a>:</p><ol><li>A “riksbank node” to create and destroy e-krona.</li><li>A “notary node” at the Riksbank to prevent double use of e-krona.</li><li>“Participants nodes” at banks, and payment service providers for checking the authenticity of e-krona.</li><li>“Nodes for end users” for deposits/withdrawals with the aid of digital wallets. </li><li>Mobile bank identifications, which <a href="https://www.bankid.com/en">have been in use in Sweden for many years</a>, will be necessary for personal identification.</li></ol><p>With the e-krona, the Swedish government will be able to see, in real time, every money transfer that anyone makes. It will also be possible to decrease access to the e-krona, for example, via a social credit score or if one is not compliant with climate change propositions. With the e-krona, the government can freeze someone's financial resources and the Swedish state can directly tax customers' accounts. As a guise pretending to spur spending, a negative interest rate would result in people losing money on their e-krona accounts and the programmable capacities of e-krona could mean that people are prohibited from buying certain goods. There will be numerous ways to program the e-krona, which opens the way to a dystopian, Orwellian surveillance and control state. </p><p>The e-krona is centralization and central planning as it existed in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gosbank#:~:text=The%20Soviet%20state%20used%20Gosbank,five%2Dyear%20plans%20and%20directives.">Soviet Union's banking system</a>.</p><p>Nevertheless, central planning has never worked, and large, centralized bureaucracies are often not very efficient. Central storage of financial information might also pose a problem for authorities. In a cyber attack, the entire network might be disabled. </p><p>Bitcoin, on the other hand, provides decentralization. It is much more difficult, maybe impossible, to attack the Bitcoin network. The Bitcoin network has also become more and more resilient over time. </p><h2>We Must Remain Vigilant </h2><p>However, the e-krona could become a competitor to Bitcoin because ordinary people might rather trust and use e-krona instead of bitcoin. One main purpose of the e-krona is price stability. Bitcoin has, at present, high price volatility. The bitcoin price’s stability is influenced by supply and demand, investor sentiments, trading activities, regulations and media hype. As of this writing, <a href="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/volatility-index/">the latest 60-day estimate for bitcoin volatility was 2.48%; while for gold, the historical average volatility has been around 1.2%; and for major currencies, it is between 0.5% and 1%</a>.<br></p><p>Financial privacy should be a human right, but central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and the e-krona are leading to the destruction of financial privacy and to the centralization of authoritarian state power. Therefore, we have to fight and prevent the creation and use of CBDCs and the e-krona. The vision of Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin, was built on three core values: security, privacy and decentralization. Bitcoin can provide all of these benefits, which CBDCs and the e-krona never can to the same extent. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Peter Bistoletti.

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Dan Weintraub, an author and high school teacher who first became interested in Bitcoin while teaching economics.</em></p><p>Recently, I’ve been thinking a good deal about Balaji Srinivasan’s $1 million dollar bet that bitcoin would reach $1 million in June (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brandonkochkodin/2023/05/02/balaji-srinivasan-concedes-bet-that-bitcoin-will-reach-1-million-in-90-days/?sh=698f93cb76c6">which he recently conceded</a>), his <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/balaji-srinivasan-says-hyperinflation-happening-now-makes-million-dollar-bets-on-bitcoin-price-exceeding-1m-in-90-days/">apparent hyperbole with regard to imminent U.S. dollar hyperinflation</a> and his <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/former-coinbase-cto-urges-get-to-bitcoin-before-cbdc-digital-lockdown/">musings about digital lockdowns</a>. It all sounds a bit far-fetched to me. </p><p>On this score, he reminds me of Peter Schiff, a man who <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/crypto-extinction-peter-schiff-predicted-140000434.html">for decades</a> has told us the sky is falling and that the world will end as fiat currencies all collapse; a man who claims intellectual superiority over <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/video/fed-might-look-like-fools-if-they-raise-rates-says-peter-schiff-13275500">the “fools” at the Federal Reserve</a> (meanwhile and generally speaking, the global economy hums along and collapse appears, at least for the time being, to be the stuff of dystopian clickbait on YouTube). </p><p>I, for one, try to eschew conspiracy thinking because it feels neurologically indulgent to me. In simpler words, those who peddle in conspiracy theories do so because it gets them, and their followers, off. “Meltdown masturbation,” if you will. (By way of example, the <a href="https://www.logically.ai/factchecks/library/bcfb22c4">wild-eyed belief that the U.S. government used the COVID-19 lockdowns as a trial run for further repression</a> reeks of paranoia and a desperate quest for making some kind of dopamine-producing meaning out of a rather bleak moment in time. Crazy town, really; but good fodder for the production of adrenaline-inducing catastrophe porn.)</p><p>Yes, I am skeptical of prognostications of impending doom. But that said, there is an underbelly to such thinking that reveals a far more troubling dynamic; a dynamic that, driven by the exponential age in which it exists, is fast on the rise. And this dynamic will be far more destructive, far more catastrophic, than the supposed collapse of fiat or that the coming of a global banking crisis could ever be. </p><p>We are entering an age in which all trust is dying, and with the end of trust comes the end of… <em>everything</em>. Sure, I may think that Srinivasan and all of the other gloom-and-doom, the-end-is-nigh purveyors have, in some manner and to some degree, lost their grips, but there is something quite revealing not simply in the power of their musings, but in the reality that it reveals, in the attention and excitement it attracts. </p><p>You see, no one trusts anything or anyone anymore. And that utterly terrifies me.</p><h2>The Death Of Trust</h2><p>The list of institutions that we increasingly mistrust is, well, endless. And the depth and breadth of such distrust grows daily. </p><p>I’m not so sure that I need to provide the reader with an in-depth analysis of our collective loss of trust in everything. And so, in the interest of brevity, here is the abridged version:</p><p>Track the numbers and you will see that <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/06/06/public-trust-in-government-1958-2022">trust in government is at all-time lows</a> and continues to crash. Whether it’s because our leaders actually are dishonest, self-serving, greedy, power-hungry, incipient lobbyist-ghouls, or whether it’s because that’s how they are portrayed in the media, government officials and institutions are roundly and profoundly distrusted. </p><p>An <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilywashburn/2023/02/03/america-less-confident-in-police-than-ever-before-a-look-at-the-numbers/?sh=2e27e4296afb">ever-diminishing minority trusts law enforcement</a>, perhaps because such a minority either has relatives who serve on the police force or because their own power is buoyed by the machinations of the policing and legal systems. For the most part, Americans seem to view police officers as former high-school misfits who magically discovered expressions of sweet revenge in being able to bully the rest of us. Add to this the widespread corruption that permeates every nook and cranny of law enforcement and of our justice system (<em>cough, the </em><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/politics-law-drive-supreme-court-decisions-poll/story?id=99168846"><em>Supreme Court</em></a><em>, cough</em>), and it’s no wonder that “f*** the police” is a popular cultural refrain. </p><p>Interestingly, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/403166/americans-trust-media-remains-near-record-low.aspx">fewer and fewer people trust the so-called mainstream media</a>; so few, in fact, that there actually isn’t a mainstream media anymore. Pretty much all media has become an expression of ideological vitriol, a theatrical dance aimed at capturing a larger market share of the neurologically dispossessed; a cynical beast birthed and nurtured to line the coffers of the men and women who captain these galactic founts of misinformation. </p><p><a href="https://www.k12dive.com/news/pandemic-declined-trust-public-education/637383/">Few trust our public school systems anymore</a>. What was once viewed as a virtuous institution, an endeavor of the highest good, public education has been summarily devoured by every possible ideologically-propelled interest group; the vomit that has followed has painted a picture of public education as rife with lazy teachers teaching knucklehead kids.</p><p>I could go on. From corrupt corporations and their corrupt CEOs to the self-serving, self-righteous and self-aggrandizing leaders of organized labor; from duplicitous, woke and censorship-informed activists touting the need for correct pronoun adherence to the reactionary and manipulative religious leaders looking to return the nation to the wonderful patriarchies of the 1950s, trust is vanishing into the very ether in which these individuals stoke their fires and solidify their self-concentered narratives.</p><p>But wait! It gets better. For now, superimposed over this already bleak landscape, say hello to ChatGPT, to deep fake technology, to central bank digital currencies; bid an open-hearted welcome to trust’s final frontier, a world in which discerning truth from falsehood becomes virtually impossible.</p><p>What a dumpster of a world. What is to be done?</p><p>Enter, Bitcoin.</p><h2>Bitcoin And Verification Of Truth</h2><p>I have written several papers (I like to call them books because it makes me feel smart, and I have even published them on Amazon) about Bitcoin, extolling the virtues of this quite-extraordinary technology. In all of those pieces I have asked, nay begged, that we have some imagination when considering our Bitcoin future. I will go even further here: Bitcoin is our <em>only</em> hope in an increasingly trustless world, for within the Bitcoin protocol lies the answer to all of the conundrums <em>posed</em> by a trustless world: </p><p>The ultimate answer is verification of truth. Hear me out.</p><p>To begin with, when I suggest that we have some imagination, I am actually not asking for all that much. The boxes in which we live, the lenses through which we view reality, have evolved time and time again. It wasn’t all that long ago that we believed that the Earth was the center of the universe, that humans would never fly, that computers were the providence of NASA. Things have changed, and they have changed quickly. The <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/world-wide-web-launches-in-public-domain">public internet was born</a> around 30 years ago, give or take. Now look at us. It is almost too hard to imagine what the next 10 years will bring.</p><p>So, why Bitcoin? Why is this relatively-straightforward technology (ingenious and elegant, complex and nuanced… but straightforward nonetheless) the answer to the impending doom we all face if we are unable to prime and restart our national and international trust engine? </p><p>It’s simple. Because Bitcoin <em>is</em> the truth. On a most basic level, the Bitcoin protocol — and the tens of thousands of nodes that run the software — verifies each and every transaction that takes place on chain. No one is in control. No one’s word needs to be taken as fact. The truth is manifest and auditable on the blockchain itself. Countless, entirely-objective nodes make falsification of the record an impossibility. Bitcoin is thus an inviolable, immutable, incontrovertible truth.</p><p>Have some imagination!</p><p>What if, just what if, the Bitcoin network, in time, becomes the base layer of this thing we call the internet? What if all data that passes through this network is verified and scoured for falsehood by the soon-to-be billions of verifying nodes; nodes that become native to the devices that we employ for all of our communication and social/virtual interactions? And what if more and more people, in an effort to <em>believe</em>, abandon the cynical and exploitative and fetid digital world that has evolved to date, and instead join a network of unassailable truth?</p><p>You see, the promise of Bitcoin is not that it serves as sound money in an unsound monetary universe; the promise is not that it births a banking system that is devoid of scammy, fraudulent middlemen; no, the promise is far, far more profound. </p><p>The promise of Bitcoin is that it slowly devours the very beast that gave birth to its need. </p><p>Trust is a human imperative, a social imperative. Without trust, chaos ensues. In a world in which belief in things must always be questioned, mental health suffers, governments fail and anarchy rises; lawlessness and violence become the norm rather than the exception. In a trustless world, isolation and hoarding are seen as virtues rather than maladaptations. In a trustless world, everything falls apart, institutions crumble, warlords and demagogues emerge on an ever-rising tide of uncertainty and fear. </p><p>We are moving toward such a future, toward such a world. Bitcoin is our only hope. In Bitcoin there exists the possibility that trust can slowly be reestablished, not based upon the words and deeds of men, but instead on a universal digital protocol that sifts through the mire and always, without prejudice, arrives at the truth.</p><p>We must have the imagination to believe in this possibility. This is what makes Bitcoin a beacon of hope, a ray of light permeating the haze of a creeping fog of surrender. </p><p>I HODL bitcoin, thus. I preach the gospel of Bitcoin because I dare to hope, for my great grandkids, in a world community governed by truth, verified by benevolent objectivity; a world in which trust forms the very core of our existence.</p><p>So to Srinivasan and Schiff and all of the other catastrophians I say: Perhaps you are right. But the truth remains: The only way out of this existential death spiral is through a rebirth of trust, and only Bitcoin, realized to its highest and most majestic potential, can provide this. </p><p>Just imagine.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Dan Weintraub.

    </figure><p><em>Disclaimer: Bitcoin 2023 and Bitcoin Magazine are both operated by BTC Inc.</em></p><p>The Declaration of Monetary Independence (DoMI), which made an <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-2022-separation-of-money">impressive debut at Bitcoin 2022</a> in Miami Beach, will once again be on display at Bitcoin 2023. The 9-foot by 12-foot document made a massive impact on attendees at the previous conference, with thousands of Bitcoin enthusiasts adding their signatures to the piece of art. <a href="https://declarationofmonetaryindependence.org/">DoMI</a> is essentially a 21st-century version of the Declaration of Independence, with 27 reasons listed on why fiat currency is an unfair and broken monetary system controlled by governments that favors the wealthiest and most privileged. The second half of the document lists 29 reasons why Bitcoin is the fairest and most egalitarian monetary system ever conceived and implemented.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>At Bitcoin 2022, DoMI was displayed at the entrance of the Nakamoto Stage, where it attracted the attention of everyone who entered. The signing got off to a slow start, but after one of the original authors of the document signed it, hundreds of attendees started to add their own signatures to the piece of art. Over the course of the three-day conference, thousands of people signed the document, making it resemble activist street art upon a replica of the original Declaration of Independence.</p><p>As Bitcoin 2023 approaches, Bitcoin enthusiasts are eagerly looking forward to the re-emergence of DoMI. The document will once again be displayed prominently at the conference, this time on a 10-foot by 8-foot document with a “Tick toc next block” background in the Lightning Food Court, reminding everyone of the need to separate money from the state and to promote Bitcoin as the fairest and most egalitarian monetary system. Attendees can expect the same enthusiasm and excitement that characterized the signing of DoMI at the previous conference, with many people eager to add their signatures to this historic document.</p><p>DoMI is a reminder that Bitcoin is more than just a digital currency; it represents a fundamental shift in the way we think about money and the role of government in its creation and regulation. As Bitcoin continues to gain wider acceptance and adoption, DoMI will serve as a testament to the power of decentralization and the need for a fairer and more just monetary system.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyNTM3MTYyODg3OTk2OTY0/individual-challenge-climb-peak-flag-mountain-top-photo.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTg4ODc1MDA5NjMwOTM4NzA0/domi-saturday.jpg" height="827" width="620" medium="image" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bull Bitcoin Launches No-KYC Purchasing Through Canadian Post Office]]></title><description><![CDATA[Users can now purchase up to $999 CAD at any post office without providing personal identifying information.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bull-bitcoin-launches-no-kyc-purchasing</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bull-bitcoin-launches-no-kyc-purchasing</guid><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[KYC]]></category><category><![CDATA[bull bitcoin]]></category><category><![CDATA[Exchanges]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 09 May 2023 14:59:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgyODY5MDM0MjAxNTIzNjE5/img_4905.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Brad Mills, host of the Magic Internet Money Podcast and an investor in several Bitcoin-focused projects.</em></p><p>Big banks are failing. Credit Suisse, one of the largest globally-systemic important banks (G-SIBs) in the world <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2023-credit-suisse-bank-decline-explainer-timeline/">at $1.2 trillion in total assets</a>, has recently failed, requiring a bailout from the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/switzerland-puts-up-260-billion-francs-credit-suisse-rescue-documents-2023-03-20/">Swiss central bank</a>. </p><p>Before the era of quantitative easing (QE), Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TARF) and Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) bailouts, bank failures were common. Allowing excess risk to flush from the system is a healthy part of free markets. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bank_failures_in_the_United_States_(2008%E2%80%93present)">Almost 500 banks</a> failed during the Great Financial Crisis (GFC). </p><p>During the last decade of QE, barely any banks failed while economists, central bankers and politicians have been continually and confidently assuring us that their stress tests are keeping the banking system sound.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3ODAyODQ4ODk1OTAzMDIx/fkcq8six0aahwdu.jpg" height="478" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>Is it a coincidence that during the last decade, as governments, central banks and commercial banks worked together to expand the money supply faster and higher than ever before in history, that banks stopped failing? </p><p>Have banks stopped failing over the last seven to eight years because banks are safer and more conservative, or is it because record amounts of money printing and government bailouts have moved the risk from bank balance sheets to somewhere else, simply delaying the inevitable? </p><p>Did moving this risk from bank balance sheets to the central bank’s balance sheets via deficit spending, stimulus, QE and bailouts actually help keep your deposits safer, or has it actually caused wealth inequality to rise, debased the value of your savings account and contributed to high inflation rates which makes the dollars in your bank worth less? </p><p>Finally, after all of this, are we about to see a reversion to the mean of bank failures anyway? Is there a way to protect yourself from the extremely-unlikely event of hyperinflation, or the more-likely event of a deflationary bust or continued high inflation due to governments printing money to prevent the collapse of the global banking system and the loss of confidence in the currency itself? </p><h2>Deposit Insurance Turned Into A Confidence Game</h2><p>Economists and policymakers cite Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) insurance and post-GFC regulations like <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LawRegulation/DoddFrankAct/index.htm">the Dodd-Frank Act</a> and <a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/basel3.htm">Basel III</a> stress tests to assuage our concerns, telling us that the banks are healthy and that the banking system is sound. </p><p>The reality is that the insurance fund is woefully undercapitalized to cover large bank failures. </p><p>In the U.S.,<a href="https://twitter.com/zerohedge/status/1637974397347676160?lang=en"> there is more than $18 trillion in deposits and only about $125 billion in the FDIC fund</a>. <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/berkshire-hathaway-sitting-record-pile-153952186.html">Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway has more money than the FDIC</a>.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3ODAyNzc1ODgyMDQ4ODEz/pasted-graphic-1.png" height="382" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>FDIC insurance was <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/bank/historical/firstfifty/chapter1.pdf">put into place in 1933</a> during the Great Depression as a way to provide confidence in the banking system. A lot has changed since 1933. The money supply used to be constrained by the amount of gold that was backing dollars. There was still fractional-reserve lending, but it was a lot more conservative back then. </p><p>While we were on a sound money standard, it was plausible that the FDIC and CDIC could act as a legitimate insurance policy for depositors, when coupled with strong bank regulations and balanced budgets. </p><p>However, the FDIC’s reserves have failed to keep up with the growth in the money supply, and it has had to be bailed out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Deposit_Insurance_Corporation">in some form or another</a> during the 1990s, in 2008 and 2009 and, most recently, with the latest round of bank failures. </p><p>Deposit insurance is just another strategy in the confidence game designed to distract you from discovering the reality of how money and banking work. </p><h2>Addressing Fractional Reserve Banking And The ‘Money Multiplier’</h2><p>Many think that we operate on a fractional-reserve bank system that enables the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_multiplier">money multiplier</a>,” but this is a common misconception as banks do not operate on that system anymore. Banks literally have the license to print money from nothing and the “money multiplier” is a myth.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>You may have seen fractional-reserve banking and the money multiplier described as the bank keeping 10% of your deposit as reserves and lending the rest out, then repeating that process until the original deposit is multiplied upwards of ten times.</p><p>When you deposit $1,000 into the bank, there is no formula that says the bank keeps 10% of that as reserves and then it can loan $900 to someone else, repeating this ad nauseum until $1,000 becomes $10,000. </p><p>In reality, it’s “<em>fictional</em> <em>reserve</em>” banking, because the money lent out by banks is not backed by anything tangible and the debt that the government issues continually expands. The national debt will never be paid off and the banks have no reserve requirements anymore. </p><p>Many smart people reject this framing. They can’t accept that this is how the monetary system works. </p><p>Don’t feel bad if you’re confused about this stuff. It’s an opaque process <em>designed</em> to obfuscate the reality of how the purchasing power of money will always be debased.</p><p>The modern banking system is like a computer operating system where a small group of people have root-level administrator access, and they give a group of their friends a god mode cheat code. </p><p>The reality is that “BankOS” has been architected as a system of control and a wealth transfer mechanism from the bottom to the top… and you’re probably not at the top. </p><p>Many smart people who believe they understand the banking system are confused about how banks issue loans, they believe that banks conservatively issue new loans based on the amount of deposits they have. They believe that as customer deposits grow, banks lend that money out, and since the money had to exist in order for the bank to lend it out, the banks didn’t print the money. </p><p>This is a naive understanding, and it does not serve your interests to believe in this fairytale. </p><p>Let’s take Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_bank_failures_in_the_United_States">the third-largest bank to collapse in U.S. history</a>.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>My smart friends will look at the above graphs and say, “See, Silicon Valley Bank didn’t just make money from nothing; they received lots of new deposits over the years and loaned out those deposits!” </p><p>They will see that the bank ended with about $200 billion in deposits and about $70 billion in loans and mistakenly think that the bank was conservatively lending existing money, not creating new money. </p><p>But the hard-to-accept reality is that the incoming deposits were actually created when a bank made a loan. </p><p>Maybe it was Silicon Valley Bank that created the deposits from nothing, maybe it was another bank — but the majority of the “deposits” in the banking system are created from nothing by banks. </p><p>My smart friends will say, “This makes no sense, if banks can create money from nothing, why wouldn’t they just continually print money to make unlimited profits?” </p><p>The truth is, when you look at the growth of the money supply, that’s what they do. </p><p>As long as there’s demand for borrowing, banks will lend. They have a license to print the money and a license to charge usurious levels of interest on the money. </p><p>It’s a wonder why banks fail at all under a system where they have a license to expand the money supply through issuing loans, constrained primarily by our demand for borrowing and what they deem your “creditworthiness” to be. </p><p>Most of the “money” in the system is actually just created from nothing this way by banks — and as icing on the cake, when you deposit this created-from-nothing-by a bank “money” into a bank, they also take your deposits and invest them in the treasury market or deposit them to the central bank as bank reserves to make even more profits. </p><p>The moment that you deposit money into a bank account, it becomes a liability on the bank’s balance sheet and is no longer “your money.” </p><p>Bank regulations are part of the confidence game, designed to prevent bank runs by depositors. In March 2020, <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reservereq.htm">the reserve requirements for U.S. banks were lifted</a>, and many British Commonwealth countries have been on a zero-reserve requirement regulatory scheme for 20 to 30 years.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Instead of 8% to 12% reserve requirements, there are various liquidity and collateral rules that banks are urged to follow. One of these rules is the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity-coverage-ratio.asp">liquidity coverage ratio, or LCR</a>. </p><p>LCR is important when it comes to bank runs, which is what we are seeing happen now across the global banking system. </p><p>In order to pass regulatory stress tests, banks must keep a portion of their reserves in <a href="https://www.bis.org/basel_framework/chapter/LCR/30.htm?tldate=20191231&amp;inforce=20191215">high-quality liquid assets (HQLA)</a> which include cash and cash-like instruments such as government bonds that can be quickly sold to meet customer withdrawals. </p><p>Banks must always have enough high-quality liquid assets in order to meet 30 days of expected net outflows and customer withdrawals. </p><p>The Bank of Canada assumes that customer deposits in the country’s <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bigsixbanks.asp">”Big Six” banks</a> are very sticky, so it <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2022/05/staff-analytical-note-2022-5/">only assigns a run-off rate of 3% to 5%</a> and these banks are not required to keep significant HQLAs to cover deposits.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>The problem arises when there is a systemic crisis in either the banking system or the money itself that causes fear and panic, driving people to withdraw their money physically or wire it out digitally. </p><p>In 2022, when Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergencies_Act">invoked the Emergencies Act</a> and threatened to freeze the bank accounts of anyone involved in or supporting the Freedom Convoy, this caused a run on the Canadian banks, as shown by the LCR chart below. </p><p>This sudden shock and erosion of trust in the Canadian banking system from a large enough percentage of the population caused the LCR of Canada’s biggest banks to drop significantly. </p><p>When a bank run happens, 30 days’ worth of expected net outflows might be taken out in one day, leaving the bank potentially insolvent if there are liquidity issues with the high-quality liquid assets the bank uses for its HQLA reserves.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>‘Too Big To Fail’: How The Current Bank Failures Are Not Like 2008 </h2><p>So, now that we know that the money multiplier is a myth and banks are actually allowed to create credit (money) from nothing via fictional-reserve banking, authorized by the central bank, let’s continue! </p><p>Why did we not see any signs of bank failures during the last 10 years until now? </p><p>It turns out that the central bankers kept interest rates near zero while they recapitalized banks and monetized record government debt issuance (deficit spending) to the tune of trillions of dollars. In that environment, banks appear to be healthy. </p><p><em>If the government gave you a money printer, I’m sure your finances would be a lot more sound as well! </em></p><p>There is a “financial soundness” indicator that the central banks use known as a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/common-equity-tier-1-cet1.asp">Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio</a>, which is also known as a capital buffer. </p><p>In the chart below, thanks to QE and other bailout programs, you can see that the soundness of the banks increased until recently, when we saw the largest percentage drop of CET1 since they started measuring it.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>U.S. banks went from having nearly zero excess reserves pre-2008, to being continually injected with hundreds of billions per year via bailouts and QE until the total reserves parked at the Federal Reserve peaked at an astronomical $4 trillion recently.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>The last banking crisis was caused by too much real estate speculation by the public and too much toxic, derivative-risk taking by big banks. </p><p>The big banks were deemed “too big to fail.” In order to save the flawed system, they threw out the idea of being fiscally conservative and started normalizing bailouts as the first resort. </p><p>We are 50 years into the backed-by-nothing U.S. dollar experiment and nearly 15 years into this infinite, reserve-banking, central-planning experiment, and it looks like everything is broken, especially the purchasing power of dollar savers. </p><p>Too much centralization and interference in financial markets to save the “too big to fail” banks has shown up as an acceleration of the perversion of incentives in the economy. </p><p>The role of the dollar went from being a savings vehicle — work hard and save your money — to a system of control and wealth redistribution from the bottom to the top — work hard and spend your money. </p><p>Due to this new ‘too big to fail’ experiment, we’ve seen the rise of the “everything bubble,” which makes this crisis much different than the last one. The current crisis is a crisis of confidence in the money itself and the entire banking system, not necessarily anything that the banks did.</p><figure>

With the central bankers signaling that rates would be held lower for longer, this encouraged over borrowing and excessive risk taking by banks, corporations and citizens. </p><p>Combine this poor central banking policy with gluttonous government deficit spending and we see the total supply of money rise exponentially. </p><p>When you add in the supply chain disruptions from the “<a href="https://www.cato.org/commentary/abundance-doesnt-end#:~:text=Speaking%20to%20his%20ministers%20at,and%20the%20ongoing%20supply%20problems.">end of the age of abundance</a>” as French president Davos aficionado Emmanuel Macron recently warned about — all of this has caused inflation to rise faster than my generation has seen in our lifetimes. </p><p>The <a href="https://www.thebalancemoney.com/national-debt-by-year-compared-to-gdp-and-major-events-3306287">U.S.’s national debt increased</a> from a staggering $10 trillion to a mind-numbing $30 trillion since the 2008 to 2009 GFC.</p><p>The money supply has inflated massively.

In the post-war era, we inherited monstrous debts fighting the fascists. We basically operated on an American-led standard whereby you could exchange a U.S. greenback at a rate of $35 per ounce in gold.” </p><p>Poilievre continued talking about the prosperity we had in the post-war era under the gold standard: </p><p>“Here in Canada, with solid currency, we wrestled the inflationary beast to the ground. We paid off our record war debts, we increased the size of the Canadian economy by 300%, and by 1973 we had basically become a debt-free country.”</p><figure>

    </figure><p>“Then what happened in the 1970s?” he continued. “President Nixon wanted to spend on warfare and welfare. Of course, the Americans were bogged down in Vietnam, which was costly an enterprise. President Nixon wanted to keep his popularity at home, so he decided to spend, spend, spend… In the decade that followed 1971, not only did they unleash the American dollar from a sound money standard, but they increased the number of U.S. dollars in circulation by 150% while output only grew by 39%. In other words, the amount of money grew about four-times faster than the amount of underlying output that that money represented.” </p><p>This next part gets a bit partisan, but it’s very relevant to what we’re experiencing now.</p><p>Poilievre continued, “Here in Canada, we had Pierre Elliot Trudeau as prime minister. He looked down at all the inflation that the U.S. government was creating — they had reached double-digit inflation, a total inflationary crisis. </p><p>“The American dollar was devalued on an international basis, incapable of buying affordable petroleum on the world market … poverty was overtaking inner-city streets and the wealth gap was expanding in the United States of America. </p><p>“What did Pierre Elliot Trudeau do? He started printing money here in Canada, massively increasing the money supply. Between 1971 and 1981, the money supply in Canada grew by over 200% while GDP only grew in real terms by about 47%. </p><p>“So you can imagine when money is growing in supply at more than four times the rate as the economy is growing, you have more dollars chasing fewer goods, and what do you get?” </p><p>Inflation. </p><h2>Why Deflation Is Good And Prices Should Come Down, If It Weren’t For Central Banks And Politicians</h2><p>Not only are we dealing with government-induced inflation, but we’re also now suffering from their proposed solution to inflation: jacking up the interest rates and crushing everyone financially. </p><p>The banking crisis was never fully dealt with in 2008 and 2009. </p><p>Instead of taking a decade of pain, allowing rates to naturally rise while over-leveraged, large banks failed and poorly run businesses went under, they decided to socialize the losses and privatize the gains. </p><p>Not only was the can kicked down the road, but central bankers and economists tried to sell us on being scared of deflation! </p><p>They were trying to rationalize their monetary machinations as a way to stop prices from dropping, trying to fear monger and convince all of us that lower prices is a bad thing.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>In Jeff Booth’s book “The Price of Tomorrow,” he describes how technology is deflationary. If we had a sound money like Poilievre described, it would make sense that technological advancements and productivity gains would cause prices to drop. </p><p>With a more sound money that does not continually inflate like our current debt-based, broken money system, your purchasing power would not decline over time and we would enjoy the deflationary benefits of technology. </p><p>With deflation and a more sound monetary system, you could live a dignified life and afford a home on a smaller wage as prices naturally come down. </p><p>Critics of sound money will say that under the gold standard we saw booms and busts, and you can’t get out of an economic depression without inflating the money supply. </p><p>There is no easy answer here, and the solution is probably something in the middle, at least during a transitory phase. We need to slowly transition to a sound money system while also increasing financial literacy. </p><p>Critics of sound money systems like a gold-backed standard too often rely on a false dichotomy argument, where it has to be either continuous stimulus <em>or</em> global depression with nothing in the middle. </p><p>Something has to change — it’s clear that the debt-based, money-printing, stimulus-by-default system we’ve been operating on has seen continual expansion of the wealth gap. In fact, it is plausible to have a period of transition where you could help the bottom 50% out with a form of universal basic income, while you increase financial literacy and encourage saving in a hard money. </p><p>You could do this while eliminating a lot of excessive federal spending, and transitioning to a more sound monetary system over a period of five to 15 years, all while we enjoy the benefits of technology making our lives better! </p><p>Politicians, mainstream economists and central bankers are fighting the deflationary benefits of technology by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/20/the-federal-reserves-2percent-inflation-targeting-policy-explained.html">arbitrarily targeting 2% inflation</a> and continually increasing the supply of money via various methods like government deficit spending, commercial bank credit creation and central bank money printing. </p><p>Since these economists and bankers were claiming that QE and stimulus didn’t cause inflation, they were fear mongering about a “deflationary spiral,” trying to create the political will for the next round of money printing to keep their inflation experiment going… and, predictably, they overreacted and gave us an inflationary crisis instead of a deflationary one.</p><figure>

They didn't ‘print cash’ per se, they just used a ‘kind of central bank reserve’ thing. No physical notes means it's not literally ‘printed cash.’ So it's a figurative lie, not a technical one.”</p><figure>

    </figure><p>He continued, “Those deposits can be turned into hard paper cash. That is why the money supply went from $1.8 trillion to $2.3 trillion — half a trillion dollars, which is almost exactly what the deficit was — not a coincidence. </p><p>“The paper money — the stuff that’s printed — went from $90 billion to $124 billion. Both increased by approximately 27% in a few years. </p><p>“The money that’s still on deposit with the central bank has created a new problem. The central bank bought bonds with yields of 0.25% and paid for it with deposits on which it now has to pay 4.5% — in other words, they’re now losing money on the spread. </p><p>“For the first time in history, the Central Bank of Canada needs a bailout of $4 billion a year. That doesn’t take into consideration any additional losses that will happen if they eventually sell those bonds which are worth less now than when they bought them.”</p><figure>

    </figure><p>“This has been very good for the very wealthy because in addition to arbitraging those transactions, this inflationary policy drove up asset prices,” Poilievre continued. “If you have a $10 million mansion and house prices go up by 50%, you’ve just made $5 million tax free. If you’re the new immigrant who doesn’t own any property, the purchasing power of your dollar in terms of real estate has just gone dramatically down.”</p><p>Poilievre punctuated his lesson on how QE creates wealth inequality by saying it is “a massive wealth transfer from the have-nots to the have-yachts.” </p><h2>Quick Review So Far </h2><p>At this point, l’d like to recap and add some more factors to the discussion so we can continue understanding why many banks are technically insolvent and starting to fail:</p><ol><li>Central bankers held interest rates too low and signaled to everyone, including the banks, that they will continue to keep rates low to avoid deflation, promoting the flawed logic of “inflation is transitory” and “deflation is bad.” </li><li>Banks do not operate on a reserve system anymore — instead they continually create debt money through credit issuance and are encouraged to hold high-quality liquid assets, such as government bonds and mortgage-backed securities, to protect against bank runs in case everyone discovers there are not adequate reserves for everyone to get their money out.</li><li>Governments inflated the money supply with massive stimulus and deficit spending. Central Banks enabled the massive deficit spending with QE. </li><li>QE by itself did not directly add new money to the system, even though the central bank created the reserves from nothing — because banks used existing money (our deposits!) to buy the bonds which they sold to the central banks.</li><li>The G7 made a difficult decision to drop a nuclear bomb on the financial system by <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/4/18/g7-ministers-pledge-to-intensify-russia-sanctions-slam-china#:~:text=The%20foreign%20ministers%20of%20G7,member%20of%20the%20international%20community%E2%80%9D.">sanctioning Russia</a>, putting contagion pressure on European and other Western banks. </li><li>Central banks started raising rates faster than they ever have before in history to combat inflation, deflating the bond bubble and causing banks to become insolvent.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>As Poilievre mentioned in his rebuke of QE, central banks could realize losses if they are forced to sell bonds. </p><p>However, a fair rebuttal to this argument is that central banks don’t have to sell their bonds — they will likely hold them for years or decades to maturity and not realize any losses in dollar terms because they can create the dollars. </p><p>(This is why they claim that the bonds are “risk free.” While it’s true that they are risk free when denominated in the currency, they are not risk free when measured in purchasing power.) </p><p>Unlike central banks, regular banks are in a precarious position where they have to sell underwater bonds as depositors withdraw record amounts of money. </p><p>Due to this exodus from the banking system, they are no longer able to hide the problem with accounting tricks. The depositor runs are forcing banks to realize the massive losses that were hidden with <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/held-to-maturity-security.asp">held-to-maturity (HTM) accounting</a> rather than fair-value accounting of their underwater bond portfolios. </p><p>This accounting trick only worked as long as depositors didn’t withdraw their funds. Now that there are record withdrawals happening, as demonstrated in the chart below, it is exposing the insolvency and causing banks to fail. </p><h2>Why Are People Withdrawing Their Money At Historic Rates? </h2><p>There are two main reasons why depositors are withdrawing their money. </p><p>Firstly, as depositors lose confidence in their banks, it causes them to move their money to a bank that they trust more. Secondly, high interest rates are causing depositors to wire their money out of their accounts to seek higher yield in money market funds, bonds, guaranteed investment contracts (GICs) and certificates of deposit (CDs) and other investment vehicles. </p><p>Maybe you haven’t thought about how unfair this is, but many people are realizing that the banks and central banks are taking advantage of them. </p><p>Let’s say you’ve been depositing and saving money at a big bank, and the big bank gives you a savings rate of roughly 0%. The big bank took your money and bought government debt during QE and received central bank reserves which it parks at the central bank and now gets paid about 5%! </p><p>People are waking up to how unfair this is, and they are wiring their savings out of their banks and putting it into investments and alternative stores of value, like gold, real estate and bitcoin. </p><p>In an age of digital money, bank runs in the 2020s don’t look like they did in the 1920s. Instead of lineups around the corner, now we have digital bank runs. </p><p>In 2022, a record $600 billion in deposits were withdrawn from U.S. banks:</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Either way you choose to look at the data, there is a historically-significant amount of withdrawals happening from bank accounts.</p><h2>Blaming COVID Is Inaccurate: Government Bonds Are Losing Value</h2><p>The banks are backing only a fraction of deposits by holding some of their reserves in HQLAs like U.S. treasuries, which are supposed to be easily converted to dollars. (Colloquially, this is known as “money good.”) </p><p>U.S. treasuries are thought of as the safest collateral in the world. The U.S. bond market has historically been deeply liquid and U.S. bonds are considered to be the “world reserve asset” alongside the U.S. dollar as the “world reserve currency.” </p><p>However, the cracks started to appear in the foundation of the financial system in 2019, before the pandemic was used as an impetus to restart QE. </p><p>In 2019, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/03/20/federal-reserve-cuts-growth-forecast-predicts-no-more-rate-hikes/">Federal Reserve tried to slowly raise interest rates and stopped doing QE</a>. </p><p>Since we operate on a debt-based money system where our economies are addicted to stimulus, when the central bankers “took away the punch bowl” by stopping QE, and started to slowly raise rates, the interbank lending markets froze up. Overnight, bank-to-bank borrow rates <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-repo-tools-explainer-idUSKBN1YR0F2">massively shot up to more than 10%</a>! </p><p>This liquidity freeze up is similar to what started the 2008 financial crisis, so the Federal Reserve immediately intervened in the interbank lending markets and started doing a stealth form of bank bailouts the year before anyone had even heard of COVID-19.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>How Bad Is This Compared To Previous Bank Failures? </h2><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_bank_failures_in_the_United_States">Three of the largest bank failures in U.S. history have just happened</a>, Silicon Valley Bank at $209 billion, Signature Bank at $118 billion and First Republic Bank at $229 billion.</p><p>(For reference, the largest bank failure in U.S. history was Washington Mutual at $307 billion in 2008.) </p><p>Hundreds of U.S. banks would technically be insolvent if it weren’t for HTM accounting, in a similar position as the banks that have failed already. Time will tell if banks like Silicon Valley Bank and Silvergate were the riskiest banks or just the first banks to fail. </p><p>The failure of these large banks led to <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230312a.htm">emergency action by the Federal Reserve</a>, starting up a new round of bailouts and lending programs designed to prevent the banks from having to realize the losses on their U.S. treasuries. </p><p>Instead of having to sell their HQLA government bond portfolios and realizing losses to meet withdrawals, they can now borrow money from the Federal Reserve against their bond portfolios at the held-to-maturity value rather than the actual market value.</p><p>Essentially, central planners intervened with the free market pricing mechanism, rescuing banks once again by allowing them to mark up the value of their bond portfolios to their held-to-maturity values rather than just borrow freshly printed Fed money — allowing them to borrow even more money than what the bonds are worth. </p><p>Typically, banks avoid borrowing from the Fed via the <a href="https://www.frbdiscountwindow.org/">discount window</a> as there’s a stigma attached to the institutions who do so. Remember, the colloquial term is that the Fed is the “lender of last resort.” </p><p>Since it’s public who is borrowing from the Fed as a last resort, that’s interpreted as a sign of weakness by the market. But when there’s systemic risk in the system, the stigma of borrowing from the Fed seems to be removed. </p><p>Strangely, the Federal Reserve is actually charging banks a pretty high interest rate. </p><p>In this scenario, the Federal Reserve has gone from the lender of last resort to the loan shark of last resort for small- and medium-sized banks, <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/13-3-report-btfp-20230316.pdf">paying about 5%</a> for <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230312a.htm">Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP)</a> funding or borrowing at the Fed’s discount window. </p><p>They call this program BTFP, and I look at it like a living will for the U.S. banking system. </p><h2>What The BTFP Does To Slow The Banking Crisis </h2><p>The Fed’s BTFP does two things. </p><p>Firstly, it hopes to stop the banking crisis by giving banks more time to process withdrawals, stopping panic from spreading as customers return to a state of complacency with their deposits. </p><p>It is buying time. The longer this draws out, the more they can control the narrative. </p><p>Secondly, if that fails and this really is the resolution of the 2008 crisis where we see sustained bank runs and systemic bank insolvencies, the BTFP helps reduce the pressure on the FDIC if it has to resolve hundreds of small and medium bank failures. </p><p>As we’ve learned so far, there is not enough demand in the free market to buy the bonds that the government is trying to sell, so the central bank has to buy the bonds to fund government deficit spending and QE.</p><p>There is <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/fed-emergency-loans-btfp-banking-liquidity-svb-collapse-contagion-deposits-2023-3">upwards of $2 trillion in bonds</a> held by hundreds of small- and medium-sized banks. </p><p>If these banks have to sell these bonds into the market, that will freeze up the bond market, which might cause a loss of confidence in the money itself, which is much worse than a loss of confidence in banks. </p><p>The Fed’s BTFP allows them to create <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-16/jpmorgan-says-fed-s-loans-will-provide-2-trillion-of-liquidity#xj4y7vzkg">up to $2 trillion and lend it to these banks</a>, taking their underwater bonds off the market and putting some 500 small- and medium-sized U.S. banks into debt to the Fed. </p><p>If these banks fail, the Federal Reserve can absorb the bond collateral onto its balance sheet without it looking like another round of QE and bailouts as the banks have become debtors to the Fed. </p><p>These money-printing, bank-lending schemes are all about buying time and stopping fear from spreading in both the banking system and the bond market themselves. </p><h2>Is This A Widespread Banking Crisis? </h2><p>If enough customers try to withdraw their money from banks, the banks will go insolvent… because not only are the dollars printed from nothing, but the banks do not even have the “dollars” anymore. </p><p>In fact, the money in your bank account is not even “your money.” It’s actually a liability on the bank’s balance sheet. This is why bank bail-in provisions were written into law post-GFC. </p><p>If they can not prevent the fear from spreading and we see a systemic failure, banks can legally do bail-ins and haircuts above the CDIC/FDIC limits, like we saw in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_government-debt_crisis">Greece</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012%E2%80%932013_Cypriot_financial_crisis">Cyprus</a> a decade ago. </p><p>The FDIC and the Fed knew the banks were in trouble last year. They started holding meetings and trying to come up with rule changes to figure out how to resolve large bank failures. </p><p>They know FDIC insurance is a fairy tale designed to keep depositors placated and that if large banks start to fail, the FDIC fund is laughably undercapitalized to resolve that situation. </p><p>They discussed doing haircuts and bank bail-ins, as well as disclosing information on the true risks in the banking system to the public in advance of a systemic event.</p><p>Some <a href="http://fdic.windrosemedia.com/index.php?category=Systemic+Resolution+Advisory+Committee">recent comments from FDIC regulators on bank bail-ins from November 2022</a>: </p><p>“It’s important that people understand they can be bailed-in. You don’t want a huge run on the institutions, but there are going to be (runs) and it could be an early warning signal to the FDIC and the primary regulators.</p><p>“…and if there’s significant long-term debt, you can contemplate a bail-in-type exit for these institutions where you’re turning the institution over to its creditors.” </p><p>There does not seem to be the political will to allow bail-ins to happen yet. </p><p>As we saw just a couple of months after this FDIC meeting, when banks actually started to fail, the Silicon Valley billionaires were bailed out instantly and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/silicon-valley-bank-deposits-guaranteed-signature-bank-federal-reserve-fdic/#:~:text=All%20deposit%20accounts%20at%20both,Deposit%20Insurance%20Corporation%20(FDIC).">all deposits were guaranteed</a>. </p><p>The $250,000 FDIC limit was essentially <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fdic-proposes-congress-increase-deposit-insurance-limits-for-payroll-accounts-181123469.html">thrown out the window</a> immediately. </p><p>While the legal framework is in place, bail-ins seem to be a last resort tool at the bottom of the toolbox. You can think of bail-ins like lockdowns. They will only go with that option when they are about to completely lose control. In February 2020, the idea of schools and public buildings being shut down and everyone being forced to stay at home was thought to be hyperbolic and ridiculous. </p><h2>FDIC/CDIC Unable To Handle The Failures Of Large Banks </h2><p>In fact, when you look at the CET1 ratios of Canadian banks, it does not look great. </p><p>Silicon Valley Bank failed <a href="https://www.almfirst.com/what-to-know-about-svb-signature-bank-and-the-feds-emergency-measures/">with a CET1 ratio of 14%</a>, and Credit Suisse failed with a <a href="https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us-news/en/articles/media-releases/csg-announcement-202303.html#:~:text=As%20of%20the%20end%20of,of%20March%2014%2C%202023">CET1 ratio of 15%</a>, which is better than the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CBIC) or Scotiabank, which are all under 13%:</p><figure>

    </figure><p>There’s not enough capital buffer in the banking system to absorb the massive losses in these bond markets. </p><p>Preston Pysh, host of “The Investors Podcast,” <a href="https://twitter.com/PrestonPysh/status/1638272343804989440">recently tweeted</a>: </p><p>“The total capital buffer in the US banking system is $2.2 trillion, while unrealized losses are between $1.7 and $2 trillion. If banks had to liquidate their bond and loan portfolios, they'd lose 77-91% of their capital cushion, highlighting the fragility of most banks. 186 US banks are in distress.” </p><p>The idea that CDIC/FDIC insurance can cover the losses from a systemic failure is a fantasy. </p><p>The FDIC couldn’t handle even the first bank failure in 2023 and had to tag in the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve to backstop depositors, as 97% of the deposits of that bank were those millionaires and billionaires, evidenced by the fact <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/svbs-collapse-exposes-the-feds-massive-failure-to-see-the-banks-warning-signs/">that they were above the $250,000 deposit insurance limit</a>. </p><p>They decided to rescue all depositors instead of applying haircuts/bail-ins because, understandably, they felt like it would lead to systemwide panic and full-on </p><p>bank run, cascading to an unstoppable banking crisis like we saw in the 1920s, rather than the one in 2008. </p><p>There was also a real, legitimate issue of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/10/silicon-valley-bank-customers-scramble-to-meet-payroll-pay-bills.html">many Silicon Valley companies being unable to meet payrolls on the following Monday</a>, and what that would do to the economy, which is overly dependent on tech companies. </p><p>Tech companies drive stock market performance: If you look at the stock performance of the top five or 10 tech companies, and then look at the other 490 companies in the S&amp;P 500, the economic outlook would look a lot worse:</p><figure>

There are decades of policy mistakes and bipartisan political blundering that brought us here. </p><p>So, is the $250,000 FDIC limit just a fantasy if <em>all</em> deposits of the Silicon Valley elite were backstopped? Did the government just tell us that it will socialize <em>all</em> money in the banking </p><p>system with this action, or is it just going to pick winners and losers as more banks start to fail, and eventually the bail-ins start? </p><p>Foss has <a href="https://twitter.com/FossGregfoss/status/1637979478172246017?s=20">pointed out</a> that, even with all of the bailouts, emergency lending programs and confidence games that the Fed, U.S. Treasury and FDIC are playing, soon the interest rate risk might spillover to credit risk, which will be even worse for banks. </p><p>The FDIC was formed in the 1930s when the United States was still on a somewhat-sound monetary standard; it was a way to provide confidence to depositors in the U.S. banking system who had lost trust in the banks. </p><p>Today, the <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/deposit/insurance/assuringconfidence.pdf">FDIC fund only has around $100 billion</a>, which is lower than the mandated amount. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/warren-e-buffett/">Buffet has more money than the FDIC fund does</a>. </p><p>As the monetary system transitioned from sound money to credit money, and the supply of money expanded rapidly, the idea of FDIC insurance is more of an illusion — another confidence game. </p><p>We are supposed to believe that this FDIC insurance is financed by fees that banks pay on deposits, however, as we’ve seen with the recent bank failures and in previous periods of financial crisis — such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_and_loan_crisis">savings and loan crisis in the ’80s and ’90s</a> and during the GFC in 2008 and 2009 — the FDIC is too big to fail and it will also get bailed out. </p><p>They will do whatever they have to in order to prevent people from peeking behind the money curtain to see how things really operate. </p><p>So, what does all of this mean? </p><p>One thing is for certain, all of this central planning and interference in the free market to prevent the risk from flushing out of the system has a cost: </p><p>Wealth inequality is going to keep rising and your money is going to continue to lose purchasing power over time, probably at an accelerated rate. </p><p>I believe there are really only three ways that this can be resolved. </p><h2>One: No Can Kick, Leading To Deflation And Falling Prices </h2><p>Why would we see this? Well, the G8 central bankers are all trying to fight inflation at the same time as they are trying to prevent a banking sector meltdown, which requires them to keep raising rates and not doing any more blatant QE (although, in Canada, we raised first and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-11/interest-rates-bank-of-canada-to-stay-on-pause-despite-strong-economic-growth">have since put a pause on raising rates</a>.)</p><p>Another reason why this scenario is plausible is the looming debt ceiling. There’s a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/02/business/economy/us-debt-ceiling.html#:~:text=The%20national%20debt%20crossed%20%2431,is%20set%20at%20%2431.381%20trillion.">statutory cap on the amount of debt the U.S. government can have</a>, and it will need to be legally raised again before another massive round of stimulus can happen.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>In 1939, U.S. Congress passed the initial "<a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/public-debt-acts">Public Debt Act</a>" which established limits on aggregate U.S. debt levels. </p><p>The debt ceiling has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States_debt_ceiling">been raised 98 times since</a>, although sometimes this becomes a partisan battle if an opposing party controls the presidency, house or senate. </p><p>In the long arc of history, it really doesn't matter who's in power; they eventually raise the debt ceiling and print. </p><p>However, this debt-ceiling deadlock can cause problems in the short term, and we’re potentially facing that scenario now where the <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/3919994-senate-republicans-introducing-resolution-to-overturn-bidens-debt-relief-program/">Republican-controlled House does not want to allow the Democratic president to issue more debt</a> coming up to an election year. </p><p>This is deflationary because it effectively shrinks the money supply and would lead to a continuing decline in bonds and stocks. </p><p>In the “no can kick” scenario, we would see more banks fail and we could potentially even see the extreme conditions required to force bail-ins where depositors start to take haircuts. </p><p>Real estate would crash in this deflationary spiral, erasing the “phantom wealth” that most people feel when they borrow against their retirement accounts and real estate portfolios that have grown rapidly in value during the bubble. </p><p>This could lead to governments being unable to run massive deficits, as there would be no net-new buyers for bonds and confidence would be lost in government treasuries as the safest place to protect wealth. </p><h2>Two: Can Kicked Too Hard, Leading To Hyperinflation</h2><p>This scenario is the least likely to happen in the U.S. or Canada. It’s extremely unlikely yet worth discussing as it would require massive policy errors. </p><p>In this scenario, we see some exogenous event such as a once-in-a-generation pandemic, or a coronal mass ejection (CME) similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrington_Event">Carrington Event</a>, perhaps a nuclear war or an unstoppable rogue AI internet virus, which causes an acceleration of existing risks in the system. </p><p>Some people call these hard-to-predict financial shocks “black swan” events. </p><p>If we get a significant black swan event that accelerates the current banking crisis, we could see a sudden collapse of hundreds of banks as global stock markets rapidly crash and bond markets lock up, similarly to what we saw in 2008 or in March 2020. </p><p>A real estate market correction could also accelerate to a crash, causing public outcry for policymakers and central bankers to once again lower interest rates and rescue the economy. </p><p>Emergency measures would be taken, similar to what we saw in the aftermath of COVID-19, however, this time we would likely see 1930s-style price fixing, capital controls and much more massive bailouts by the government and central banks. </p><p>Only if they print obscene amounts of money in response to the crisis do we start to enter hyperinflation territory. </p><p>Hyperinflation <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hyperinflation.asp">is defined as</a> rapid monetary inflation causing prices to increase at 50% month over month. Oftentimes when people use the term hyperinflation, they don’t actually realize what they are saying, and they can sound hyperbolic to someone who understands the dictionary definition of the word. </p><p>Policymakers would have to make all the wrong choices and not have learned anything from history to cause a hyperinflationary collapse. </p><p>It’s a very unlikely scenario. </p><h2>Three: Can Kicked, Status Quo With Inflation </h2><p>This is the most likely scenario. There’s no political will to see deposits start taking haircuts, and nobody seems to want to pull the lever to be responsible for a recession. </p><p>With a status-quo can kick after the debt ceiling is raised, we get continued waves of higher inflation with interest rates held lower. </p><p>The bond markets continue getting propped up by the central banks as QE restarts and the Fed’s balance sheet expands by upwards of $10 trillion to $20 trillion. </p><p>This is where we see Ponzi finance starting to become more obvious to most people as the share of the U.S.’s debt owned by the Fed crosses 50%. </p><p>I’m not sure whether it will be able to fight the free market forces of higher interest rates, but it will try to artificially drop rates as close to zero as it can get it in order to finance the massive and growing debt of the public and private sectors as inflation rises and we continue in a higher inflation environment. </p><p>This creates another crisis in about 10 years. </p><p>Since banks are insolvent in any of these scenarios, we may still see hundreds of bank failures which will lead to further centralization of the banking system. </p><p>We will likely see the continued trend of banking Canadianization in the U.S., where 500 to 1,000 small and medium banks fail and get absorbed by larger banks. </p><p>The FDIC cannot resolve this many banks, which is why the Fed is acting as the loan shark of last resort. </p><p>The Fed absorbs up to $2 trillion of treasuries from the insolvent banks as they default on their loans from the Fed.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>How Do You Protect Yourself? </h2><p>Diversification out of dollar savings and into more scarce assets is wise. Global index funds, gold, farm land, bitcoin, etc. are all attractive options to protect and grow your purchasing power. </p><p>The response to the crisis is likely going to be more of the same: printing money and bailouts. </p><p>The purchasing power of the dollar will continue to decline against scarce assets like gold and bitcoin. </p><p>Most people reading this will not have enough money to invest into something like farmland, and while dollar-cost averaging into index funds has historically been a great bet, it has the same counterparty risks to a banking system collapse and capital controls as keeping money in the bank does. </p><p>Compared to gold, bitcoin is the fastest horse in the race and it is likely to increase in purchasing power faster than gold until it gets to gold parity, likely within 10 years. </p><p>For reference, the price of 1 bitcoin would have to increase by about 24 times to $678,125 per bitcoin in order for it to have the same market cap as gold.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>As Bitcoin gains relevance as a post-trust, world-reserve asset and digital currency for the internet, it could rise in value significantly.</p><h2>On Bitcoin’s Volatility</h2><p>If you’re a wealthy investor who is nervous about bitcoin’s historical volatility, even having a conservative allocation, like 5% of your net worth, to bitcoin as an insurance plan is still a wise strategy.<br><br>If your bitcoin drops significantly in value, or if you lose conviction and sell it in a drawdown, it won’t materially affect your life. However, if bitcoin does what many of us expect it will do over the next five to eight years, a 5% allocation to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/16/small-weightings-of-bitcoin-can-have-a-positive-impact-on-portfolios.html">bitcoin could provide outsized returns</a>. </p><p>If you’re the average Canadian who doesn’t have a significant net worth and lives paycheck to paycheck, saving a larger portion of every check in bitcoin with a five-to-10-year timeframe could change your life significantly. It did mine.<br><br>As a bootstrapped internet entrepreneur with no investing experience, I learned about money, the banking system and diversified investment strategies over the last 15 years managing my own wealth. <br><br>I started with a small allocation to bitcoin in 2011, and even though I’ve made many mistakes along the way during my school-of-hard-knocks education, the small bitcoin allocation has become the majority of my net worth. <br><br>I still hold other assets like gold, index funds, real estate and cash. I’ve held bitcoin through many volatile drops of 50% to 80% and I’m still buying bitcoin today with free cashflow. </p><p>Always expect the price of bitcoin to drop by at least 50% from where you bought it — volatility is part of bitcoin’s story as it bootstraps its way to become a global store of value. It’s imperative that you think about bitcoin as a long-term savings play, not a trade.</p><p>There is a <a href="https://genbiz.com/the-looming-millennial-wealth-transfer-60-trillion-up-for-grabs#:~:text=Globally%2C%20it%20is%20estimated%20that,future%20of%20the%20global%20economy.">$60 trillion wealth transfer</a> coming from the silent generation and boomers to the younger generations.

    </figure><p>Bitcoin has a credibly-scarce, disinflationary supply cap of 21 million, enforced by math, auditable by anyone and resistant to change by central planners, insiders or governments. </p><p>With an ever-increasing demand for BTC by younger, digital-native generations in their high-earning years, who will soon see a massive wealth transfer, the growth outlook for bitcoin is likely to only keep rising. </p><p>Also, it’s worth noting that bitcoin buyers typically have very high conviction. You can see in the data that the majority of bitcoin holders understand what they are buying, and they are willing to hold and even buy more through large drawdowns. </p><p>When the price of bitcoin peaked in 2021 and went through a bear market in 2022, dropping more than 70% from the high — the long-term holders actually increased their positions:</p><figure>

    </figure><p>This is because bitcoin savers use a strategy known as dollar-cost averaging (DCAing). Bitcoin educators and influencers typically advocate a DCA strategy to avoid the follies of trying to time the market and become a trader. </p><p>Saving trumps trading in 90% of cases. </p><h2>‘Should I Buy Bitcoin Or One Of The Other Cryptos?’</h2><p>A common misconception about Bitcoin is that it is the same as “crypto.” </p><p>If I were to stress anything that you could take away from this, it’s that Bitcoin is not the same as crypto. </p><p>Most people would do well if they just ignored crypto and learned as much as they could about Bitcoin. </p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto principle</a>, also known as “the 80/20 rule,” applies to Bitcoin. My advice to most of my friends and family member who ask me about other coins to buy is this: <br><br>You will achieve 80% of the results of active crypto traders with 20% of the effort if you simply save in and learn about BTC, ignore crypto and hold your BTC for 10 years.<br></p><figure>

    </figure><p>At this point, most of the over 1 million crypto tokens are actually some variation of a Ponzi scheme, and <a href="https://www.hedgewithcrypto.com/how-many-cryptos-have-failed/">many of them have been exploding over the last two years</a> because they have no value aside from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_fool_theory">greater fool theory</a>. </p><p>Not all of them are Ponzis. Some of them are just pump-and-dump meme investments, risky bets or even would-be “next bitcoin” competitors. A small percentage of them might have some legitimate value into the future.</p><p>Perhaps you’ve seen the top-25 or -50 crypto tokens and thought you should buy ETH, BNB or XRP to diversify into “crypto” as a whole rather than just simply save in bitcoin. </p><p>In this case, I strongly advise you to remember the Pareto principle and learn more about Bitcoin. You should do the work to understand why Bitcoin is valuable before you try to understand any of the cryptocurrency tickers. </p><p>In the significant majority of cases, whether it’s Ethereum, Solana, Dogecoin or an NFT from your favorite influencer, buying a crypto token is more like VC investing, buying penny stocks, forex trading, gambling or other forms of speculation. </p><p>Bitcoin is saving. Crypto is speculation. <br><br>Speculators can make money, but unless you want to be glued to charts, consuming crypto content for 80 hours a week while also learning how to be a professional portfolio and risk manager, you probably won’t come out ahead.</p><p>If you wouldn’t find yourself on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/">r/wallstreetbets</a> looking for the next YOLO bet on a meme stock, then don’t bother learning about Ethereum, DeFi, Web3, NFTs or “degen” crypto trading schemes. </p><p>If you <em>would</em> find yourself on r/wallstreetbets looking for the next get-rich-quick bet… do yourself a favor and do not drink the crypto kool aid. </p><p>There is no such thing as “the next Bitcoin.” Bitcoin is the next Bitcoin.</p><figure>

    </figure><p><a href="https://bittrex.com">Bittrex</a>, a bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange platform founded in 2014, has filed for bankruptcy in the state of Delaware. The decision comes after the company previously announced that it would be ceasing all operations in the U.S. effective April 30th as a result of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-78">charges</a> against the firm and its former CEO for operating an unregistered exchange, broker, and clearing agency. However, this announcement does not impact Bittrex Global, according to a <a href="https://bittrex.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/10840250329245">statement</a> released by the company, which will continue its operations as usual for customers outside of the U.S.</p><p>For customers who did not withdraw their funds from the platform prior to the end of April, the company has stated that their funds remain “safe and secure.” While the Bankruptcy Court will ultimately decide the method by which those funds can be claimed by and distributed to customers, the company stated its intentions to activate those accounts as soon as possible so that customers who meet the necessary regulatory requirements can withdraw their funds.</p><p>Bittrex has also retained Omni Agent Solutions to provide email and website updates to customers. The company has encouraged affected customers to visit their website during this process, as they will provide additional information as it becomes available, and customers will also receive information directly from the bankruptcy court.</p><p>In the released statement, the company said, "Our main priority is to ensure that our customers are made whole. We are committed to working through the bankruptcy process in a way that is transparent and compliant with all applicable laws and regulations. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your patience during this time."</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkxNjYwMTg3NDc0NDcwNTYz/bitcoin-magazine-euclosed.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[High Bitcoin Fees From BRC-20 And Ordinals Lead To Controversy And Challenges]]></title><description><![CDATA[New developments on Bitcoin have created a bull market for mining fees, causing great controversy within the Bitcoin Twitter community.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoins-high-fees-create-controversy-and-challenges</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoins-high-fees-create-controversy-and-challenges</guid><category><![CDATA[BRC-20]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[Inscriptions]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technical]]></category><category><![CDATA[Ordinals]]></category><category><![CDATA[transaction fees]]></category><category><![CDATA[Fees]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 08 May 2023 18:23:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwNDMwNTgzOTcxNjUzNTMw/bitcoin-inflation-price-rising-bullish-chart.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

    </figure><p>The fees collected in a single block of Bitcoin transactions have surpassed the block reward, a testament to the growing demand for block space as a result of Ordinals and BRC-20. Given that this is the first time this has happened without the price of bitcoin being in a significant bull market, it is a milestone in the evolution of Bitcoin, as it reinforces the growing potential for transaction fees to sustain the network's operations.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/druidian/status/1655573159188283392?s=20">According to Dustin Trammell</a>, CEO of Trammell Venture Partners, the first time that the fees in a block surpassed the block reward was in block 500,521 in 2017. <br><br>The rise in transaction fees can be attributed to the introduction of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/ordinals-1">Ordinals</a> and BRC-20. Inscriptions, sets of data inscribed utilizing the Ordinals protocol, already pumped up the fee market and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/how-inscriptions-impact-bitcoin-block-space">began impacting</a> mempools within the last couple of months. But <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-brc-20-token-standard-becomes-a-new-destination-for-meme-tokens">BRC-20</a>, a recently-introduced token standard which allows tokens to be tied to the Bitcoin blockchain, has created an economic incentive with minting, most often done on the smallest UTXO size possible, leading to the recent competition for block space.<br><br>This has led users to pay higher and higher fees to ensure that their transactions are processed faster, as miners naturally prioritize bitcoin transactions with higher fees to maximize their profits.</p><p>On top of that, the recent rise in Bitcoin's price has also contributed to an increase (although small) in transaction fees, as users are willing to pay more to move their bitcoin holdings around. The combination of these factors has resulted in a significant increase in the revenue earned by miners from transaction fees, which is now exceeding the fixed block reward in certain blocks.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>The increase in fees has had a measurable impact on businesses that utilize both on-chain bitcoin and Lightning. Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, has had to <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1655419622764720128?s=20">halt and restart bitcoin withdrawals</a> twice, claiming network congestion was the reason. As a result, the firm has stated that it is looking into <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1655419624962527233?s=20">integrating Lightning</a> in order to better facilitate small withdrawals during high fee environments. Francis Pouliot, CEO of Bull Bitcoin, a Canadian, bitcoin-only non-custodial exchange, took to Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/francispouliot_/status/1654595297199247361?s=20">saying</a> “I think it's important for bitcoiners to know how increased fees w/o increased tx volume and price pumps affect business like ours.”&nbsp;</p><p>It’s not just businesses, either — citizens in countries that rely on bitcoin are <a href="https://twitter.com/MarceMR19/status/1655378068083470336?s=20">seeing difficulties</a>, as the fees for on-chain transactions are significant sums of money for many — and Lightning is <a href="https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/1655508866233253891?s=20">not always available</a> yet.</p><p>Bitcoin’s security market <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-security-without-mining-subsidy">has long</a> been a <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanberckmans/status/1597320944846254080?s=20">center of debate</a>, as, save for price bull runs, block space has largely remained cheap since Bitcoin’s inception. </p><p>While the fixed block reward is set to decrease over time, the rise in transaction fees can offset this reduction and ensure that miners continue to be incentivized to process Bitcoin transactions. But many individuals on Bitcoin Twitter seemingly disagree with Ordinals and BRC-20 fulfilling Bitcoin’s fee market security role, <a href="https://twitter.com/CobraBitcoin/status/1655235807458873349?s=20">calling</a> the flood of transactions a “DoS attack.” </p><p>Anita Posch, a Bitcoiner focused on global adoption, also <a href="https://twitter.com/AnitaPosch/status/1655459803957739520?s=20">highlighted challenges with adoption on Twitter, asking</a>, “Can anyone explain how I'm going to onboard people with these fees? Can't use on-chain, can't open channels. Makes custodial Lightning the only option.”</p><p>Others are <a href="https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/1655507730436698112?s=20">quick to remind</a> their fellow Bitcoiners that this phenomenon is not something that can be easily reversed, and was <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinIsaiah/status/1655467258804576262?s=20">eventually inevitable</a> — the increase in fees is a major incentive for miners to continue facilitating the transactions that cause it. </p><p>“BRC-20's purpose so far has been the highlighting of certain friction points within the Bitcoin community and sparking a very necessary debate about immutability, censorship and what Bitcoin is and is supposed to be.” AngelBlock CEO Alex Strzesniewski said in regards to the controversy. “A debate that is long overdue.” </p><p>While the debate continues, the free market and built-in incentives of Bitcoin will resolve the situation in whichever way the network finds most valuable.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwNDMwNTgzOTcxNjUzNTMw/bitcoin-inflation-price-rising-bullish-chart.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3ODA2MTI2NDkyODIxMjk4/image1.png" height="281" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bitcoin Is The Lifeline Argentina Desperately Needs]]></title><description><![CDATA[Facing inflation, rising interest rates and reliance on the U.S. dollar, Argentina could solve many of its problems with Bitcoin adoption.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/as-peso-inflates-argentina-needs-bitcoin</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/as-peso-inflates-argentina-needs-bitcoin</guid><category><![CDATA[inflation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Argentina]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Markets]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Jonathan Buck]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 08 May 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkxNjYwMTg3MjA2MzYyNjEw/bitcoin-magazine-argentina.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Jonathan Buck, founder of JB &amp; GS Mining GmbH, a German bitcoin mining hosting company.</em></p><p>Argentina is currently in the midst of a crippling inflation crisis, with the national currency, the Argentine peso (ARS), losing value at an alarming rate. Just one year ago, <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/USD-ARS?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjBkoWyrtf-AhXskIkEHTepD0EQmY0JegQIBxAd&amp;window=1Y">the exchange rate from the U.S. dollar to the ARS</a> was 115.75, and at the time of this writing, it stands at 224.52. Reports indicate that on the black market, people are <a href="https://en.mercopress.com/2023/04/21/argentine-peso-keeps-sinking-against-us-dollar">paying more than double this rate</a>. The country's annual <a href="https://www.inventiva.co.in/trends/argentinas-annual-inflation-jumps-to-104-worst-since-1991/">inflation rate has skyrocketed to a staggering 104%</a>, presenting significant challenges to both its economy and citizens. In response, the country’s central bank has <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-argentina-central-bank-debate-155309902.html">raised interest rates to an astounding 81%</a>.</p><p>As the peso's value continues to nosedive, Argentinians urgently need a reliable store of value to safeguard their wealth. Enter Bitcoin, often referred to as “digital gold,” a trustless decentralized system with a capped supply of 21 million coins. This scarcity <a href="https://www.jbgsmining.com/en/post/deflation-a-misunderstood-economic-phenomenon">ensures that bitcoin's value remains less susceptible to inflationary erosion</a>. As such, by adopting Bitcoin, Argentinians can shield their assets from the rapidly-depreciating peso and maintain their purchasing power.</p><h2>Financial Inclusion And Empowerment For All</h2><p>A significant portion of Argentina's population is unbanked<a href="https://www.equifax.com/newsroom/all-news/-/story/supporting-expanded-credit-access-in-argentina/"> (estimated at 51% in 2021)</a> or underbanked, often due to strict requirements from financial institutions, high fees or insufficient access to traditional banking services. But the decentralized nature of Bitcoin allows for easier access to financial services, regardless of one's socio-economic background. Embracing Bitcoin could enable financial inclusion for Argentina's citizens, empowering them to participate in the global economy. This, in turn, could potentially drive economic growth and reduce wealth inequality.</p><p>Argentina's reliance on foreign currencies, <a href="https://www.batimes.com.ar/news/economy/argentina-remains-hooked-on-dollar-dependence.phtml">such as the U.S. dollar</a>, has contributed to its precarious economic situation. Bitcoin can provide a more stable alternative to the peso and decrease the country's dependency on foreign currencies. As a global currency, bitcoin is less vulnerable to local economic fluctuations and can help insulate Argentina from external shocks. Additionally, Bitcoin's decentralized nature prevents manipulation by central banks or governments, ensuring a more transparent and stable financial system.</p><p>In conclusion, bitcoin offers a much-needed lifeline to Argentina as it battles its inflation crisis. By embracing this digital currency, the country can secure a more stable financial future for its citizens, promote financial inclusion and reduce its reliance on foreign currencies.

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Mickey Koss, a West Point graduate with a degree in economics. He spent four years in the infantry before transitioning to the Finance Corps.</em></p><p>Whether it’s the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act">Patriot Act</a>, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/freedom-and-privacy-in-the-time-of-coronavirus/">COVID-19 measures</a> or the proposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RESTRICT_Act">RESTRICT Act</a>, it seems that the only thing U.S. politicians can agree on is that taking away freedoms is essential. <em>It’s for your own safety, you see. And we can’t forget about security, too. Who wouldn’t want to be safe and secure?</em></p><p>The unilateral agreement around these measures has made the phrase “bipartisan” a warning sign in my eyes and I am increasingly concerned about the direction we’re moving. </p><h2>Bread, Circuses And Conflict</h2><p>I was criticized on NOSTR recently for covering environmentalist Bitcoiners, the justification being that the environmentalist movement is a net negative for society. While I understand where this individual who criticized me is coming from, I think there are some deeper concerns at hand hidden behind their comments. </p><p>After some reflection, I came to a realization: People are not really concerned with the environmentalist movement. In fact, people are not really concerned about politics at all. Most political disagreements are surface-level proxy wars for a much deeper argument: the argument over control. </p><p>Who is going to have control? What are they going to use it for? How is this going to affect my life?</p><p>As governments expand at increasing rates, the fear over who has control grows along with it. I think this is the root of the polarization we’re seeing today. The real concern is about central planners and central planning. Everything else is a distraction. I think that’s the real psyop. </p><h2>Bitcoin Defunds Central Planners</h2><p>As more and more people adopt bitcoin as their savings vehicle, we can begin to grow the parallel economy and take the exorbitant privilege of money printing out of the hands of those who would seek to abuse it. </p><p>In doing so, we can slowly but surely defund the central planners that so many are fearful of. In doing so, we can reduce the level of control that keeps us up at night. In doing so, we can reduce the amount of political polarization that is seemingly tearing the country apart. </p><p>I think that too many are fighting the wrong fight and missing the forest for the trees. If Bitcoin is truly incorruptible, then why do you care who chooses to support it? Why not give everyone a chance to have their egos and preconceptions about the world absolutely shattered by this permissionless monetary protocol. </p><p>Bitcoin is for everyone. We can’t allow the culture wars to manipulate us into friendly fire. We can’t allow political narratives to co-opt Bitcoin into a weapon for politicians to wield against us. It doesn’t matter if you win your little skirmish if the war engulfs you shortly thereafter. </p><p>The faster we can gain adoption, the faster we can make all these petty arguments irrelevant. Once central planners lose their ability to control, your neighbors' vote becomes less of a concern. Without the ability to print money, governments suddenly have to think about trade offs again. The reintroduction of a sound money standard fixes political polarization. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Mickey Koss.

This reduction event is called the bitcoin halving (or “halvening” in some circles). </p><p>When Bitcoin miners successfully find a block of transactions that links a set of new transactions to the previous block of already confirmed transactions, they are rewarded in newly created bitcoin. The bitcoin that is freshly created and awarded to the winning miner with each block is called the block subsidy. This subsidy combined with transaction fees sent by users who pay to get their transaction confirmed is called the block reward. The block subsidy and reward incentivizes the use of computing power to keep the Bitcoin code running.</p><p>When bitcoin was first released to the public, the block subsidy was 50 bitcoin. After the first halving in 2012, this number was reduced to 25 bitcoin, then 12.5 bitcoin in 2016. Most recently, the bitcoin halving occurred on May 11, 2020, with miners currently receiving 6.25 bitcoin per new block.</p><figure>

        <figcaption>Bitcoin issuance gets reduced in half roughly every four years.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>The next halving is coming up in about one year. The exact date will depend on the amount of hash power that joins or leaves the network, as this impacts the speed at which blocks are found. Estimates for the next halving range from late April to early May 2024. After the next halving, the block subsidy will be reduced to 3.125 bitcoin.</p><p>In the past, the bitcoin price rose considerably after the halving, albeit many months after the subsidy was reduced. Every halving cycle, there is a debate about whether or not the halving is priced in. This question considers the fact that the halving is a well-known event and attempts to address if the market would factor this into bitcoin’s exchange rate.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3Njg3OTYzNjIxMDA4Njg1/bitcoin-halving-cycles.png" height="399" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption>The bitcoin price has typically gone through an exponential appreciation after the halving.</figcaption>
    </figure><h3>Long-Term Holder Dynamics</h3><p>Our primary thesis is that the halving leads to a demand-driven event in bitcoin, as market participants become acutely aware of bitcoin’s absolute digital scarcity. This leads to a rapid phase of exchange rate appreciation. This hypothesis is somewhat divergent from the main narrative, which is that a supply-driven event instigates the exponential increase in price because miners earn fewer bitcoin for the same amount of energy expended and put less selling pressure on the market.</p><p>When we look closely at the data, we can see that the supply shock is often already in place — the HODL army has already staked their ground, if you will. On the margin, the reduction of supply hitting the market does make a material difference in the daily market clearing rate, but the increase in price is due to a demand-driven phenomenon that hits an entirely illiquid supply on the sell side with holders who are forged in the depths of the bear market unwilling to part with their bitcoin until price appreciates by approximately an order of magnitude.&nbsp;</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3Njg3OTYzODg5NTEwMTk0/long-term-bitcoin-holders-percentage-of-supply.png" height="349" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption>Trends in long-term holder supply sets the floor and tops of market cycles.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>Statistically speaking, long-term holders are the least likely to sell their bitcoin and the current supply is held tightly by this cohort. The people who were buying and holding bitcoin while the exchange rate was down approximately 80% are now the dominant majority share of the free float supply. </p><p>The halving reinforces the reality of Bitcoin’s supply inelasticity to changing demand. As education and understanding about bitcoin’s superior monetary properties further perpetuate across the world, there will be an influx of demand while its inelastic supply makes the price rise exponentially. It isn’t until a large share of the convicted holders part with a proportion of their previously dormant stash that the exchange rate crashes from a feverish high.</p><p>These holding and spending patterns are very well quantifiable, with an entirely transparent and immutable ledger to document it all.</p><p>We know that the long-term holders are the ones setting the floor in the bear market, but they are also the ones setting tops in bull markets. Many people look to the halving’s supply shock as what drives the increase in price, with miners earning fewer coins while still needing to sell some in order to pay their bills that have remained the same cost in dollar terms (or the local currency terms). We can observe miners’ net position change overlaid with the bitcoin price and see the impact of their accumulation and selling.</p><figure>

        <figcaption>Miner net position overlaid with the bitcoin price.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>There is clearly a relationship between the bitcoin price and whether miners are accumulating or selling, but correlation does not equal causation and when we include the behavior of long-term holders, we can see how much larger the tide of holder accumulation and distribution is compared to miner sell pressure. The chart below shows the same miner net position change as above, but overlays it with long-term holder net position change, both measuring the net accumulation and distribution of the two cohorts over a 30-day period, displayed on the same y-axis. When we compare the two, it is difficult to see the miner net position change (red) in relation to the much more prominent position change of long-term holders (blue). While miner sell pressure receives all of the press, the real driver of the bitcoin cycle is the convicted holders, who set the floor with accumulation, compressing the proverbial spring for the next wave of incoming demand.&nbsp;</p><figure>

        <figcaption>Miner net position compared to long-term holder net position demonstrates the difference in scale and affect on the price.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>Long-term holders tend to distribute their coins as bitcoin makes its parabolic rise and then begin reaccumulating after the price corrects. We can look at long-term holder spending habits to see how the change in long-term holder supply is what ultimately helps the price cool off after a parabolic rise.</p><p>On-chain data shows that coins that haven’t moved for over six months currently have an average spend price that stays relatively flat during the entirety of the bear market — compared to the volatility of the market-to-market exchange rate. What occurs during the bear market is simply a reshuffling of the deck: UTXOs are exchanging hands from the speculator to the convicted, from the overleveraged to the ones who have free cash flow.&nbsp;</p><figure>

        <figcaption>Long-term and short-term holder spending price.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>During periods of market frenzy to the upside, the outflow of coins from long-term holders is much larger than the sum of daily issuance, while the opposite can be true in the depths of the bear — holders are absorbing far greater amounts of coins than the sum of new issuance. </p><p>We have been in a net accumulation regime for two years, while wiping out nearly the entire derivative complex in the process. Today’s long-term holders have coins that did not budge during the Three Arrows Capital blowup or the FTX fiasco.&nbsp;</p><figure>

        <figcaption>The red area of the chart shows a pattern of long-term accumulation.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>To demonstrate just how much conviction long-term holders have in this asset, we can observe coins that haven’t moved for one, two and three years. The chart below shows the percentage of UTXOs that have remained dormant over these timeframes. We can see that 67.02% of bitcoin hasn’t changed hands in one year, 53.39% in two years, and 39.75% in three years. While these aren’t perfect metrics for analyzing HODLer behavior, they show that at the very least there is a significant amount of the total supply that is held by people who have little intention of selling these coins anytime soon.</p><figure>

        <figcaption>The amount of bitcoin supply that hasn't been active for more than one, two and three years is increasing.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>Aside from bitcoin becoming harder to produce at the margin, the halving event’s most likely contribution to bitcoin is the marketing around it. At this point, the predominant majority of the world is familiar with bitcoin, but few understand the radical concept of absolute scarcity. With each halving, the media coverage is larger and more significant. </p><p>Bitcoin stands alone with its algorithmic and fixed monetary policy in a world of arbitrary, bureaucratic fiscal policy gone astray and a never ending stream of debt monetization policies.</p><p>The 2024 halving, less than 52,000 bitcoin blocks away, will again reinforce the narrative of supply inelasticity, while an overwhelming majority of the circulating supply is held by holders who are entirely disinterested in parting with their share.&nbsp;</p><h3>Final Note:</h3><p>Despite the halving’s lessening effect in relative terms after each cycle, the upcoming event will serve as a reality check for the market, particularly for those who begin to feel that they have insufficient exposure to the asset. As the programmatic monetary policy of Bitcoin continues to work exactly as designed, approximately 92% of the terminal supply is already in circulation, and the commencement of yet another supply issuance halving event will only reinforce the narrative of apolitical money and bitcoin’s unique digital scarcity will come into focus more sharply.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>That concludes the excerpt from a recent edition of Bitcoin Magazine PRO. </em><a href="https://bmpro.substack.com/subscribe"><em>Subscribe now</em></a><em> to receive PRO articles directly in your inbox.</em></p><figure>

    </figure><p>As all sales people know, logic and arguments are there to retrospectively rationalize decisions (or reinforce ingrained positions). A true change of mind is always a paradigm shift (small or big), and leaving the comfort zone of the old, ingrained paradigm is always a “leap of faith.” </p><p>Logic alone is seldom a strong enough catalyst and motivator for that to happen. This is why the purely-educational approach seldom is enough to break a newbie's self-reinforcing, fiat-paradigm-blindness, FUD loop.</p><p>In addition, the educational approach takes too long, and it’s too boring/technical for the “instant gratification” fiat mindset. </p><p>What is needed is another semi-conscious force that's equally powerful to FUD; namely fear of missing out (FOMO). If the level of FOMO eclipses and exceeds the level of FUD, people will convert. Simple as that.</p><h2>Making Bitcoin Irresistible To The Fiat-Minded Nocoiner</h2><p>This was always the first question I would ask myself when starting a new sales page copywriting gig:</p><p>“How do I present this offer in a way that’s absolutely, mouthwateringly irresistible to the target audience?”</p><p>The example below clearly illustrates the difference between feature-oriented “education” and “sexy,” benefit-oriented persuasion:</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Do you see the massive difference in perceived value? </p><p>Boring, educational, feature focus is a classic “rookie mistake” in the world of ad copywriting, and it’s an epidemic in the world of orange pilling. </p><p>It’s easy to believe that people need to “understand” Bitcoin before they would “invest” their hard-earned fiat into it. </p><p>The truth is, however, that Mr. Normie Nocoiner is <em>less</em> likely to “invest” the more you try to make him understand Bitcoin.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>It’s hard to “sell” people on Bitcoin when you focus on the features. </p><p>Paradoxically, Bitcoin sells itself to anyone who <em>does</em> understand it, and the reason why is simple: Bitcoin is the best deal in town. It’s an absolutely, 100% irresistible offer.</p><p>This is why every Bitcoiner is doing everything they can to get their hands on as much bitcoin as humanly possible. The key takeaway here is the “irresistible offer” part.</p><p>There is a massive difference between trying to “educate” normies about Bitcoin, and in presenting Bitcoin as the irresistible offer that it is. </p><p>With that in mind, let’s forget about “peer-to-peer,” “permissionless” and “decentralized” for a moment. Let’s instead dive into:</p><h2>Bitcoin: The Irresistible Offer</h2><p>Normies do not need to be confused by the technical monster that is Bitcoin (repeat that sentence a few times for yourself, and sense the sigh of relief it gives you).</p><p>Nor do they need to understand the history of money, what “sound money” is, or why proof of work is such a big deal.</p><p>Mr. Normie Nocoiner only needs one single thing to “click” in his mind to be orange pilled on the spot, and that is to see a deal that’s irresistible.</p><p>In essence: What will push Mr. Normie Nocoiner to take the “leap of faith” into Bitcoin boils down to three things:</p><ol><li>A clear vision of the deal that a bitcoin “investment” represents (not what Bitcoin “is” or even what it “does”).</li><li>A justified sense of urgency and FOMO.</li><li>A clear understanding of why the deal is so irresistibly good (and why holding zero bitcoin is a far bigger risk than getting off zero).</li></ol><p>Without further ado, here is my ultra-simple orange-pilling formula. It opens with the following question:</p><p>“So, what do you think will happen to the price of bitcoin once a critical mass realizes that Bitcoin mining not only solves global warming, but also the global energy crisis?”</p><p>This flies right in the face of what they’ve most likely been programmed by the media to believe, so it will definitely get their attention and make them curious.</p><p>I then follow up by reminding them that bitcoin has absolute scarcity, and that most of the supply is already in the hands of long-term holders who already understand where this is going.</p><p>You will most likely get tons of resistance when making the above claim about Bitcoin mining, which is good. It clears the space for you to present irrefutable proof elements to back it up.</p><p>You must have these proof elements ready up front, of course, and it’s a good idea to store them on your phone. You will find plenty of ammo in the orange-pilling rabbit hole that I have created over at <a href="https://bitcoinmaxinews.com/">Bitcoin Maxi News</a>.</p><p>Once they see the proof elements of how Bitcoin mining is already being used to mitigate methane emissions (which is far worse than CO2 when it comes to the “greenhouse effect”), and how it balances the grid and incentivizes the buildout of renewable energy, well, at the very least, you’ve given them something to think about.</p><p>You can then repeat the initial question, and remind them that this early-bird opportunity will not last forever. This starts a “ticking FOMO clock” in their mind, as nobody wants to miss out on a great deal.</p><p>Explain that they don’t have to go “all in,” and that owning as little as 0.2 to 0.5 BTC can turn into generational wealth for their family when all this goes mainstream.</p><p>Close by saying that owning zero BTC is the biggest financial risk they can take, and that knowing these things is akin to having fully-legal “insider knowledge” that 98% of the population doesn’t know about — yet.</p><p>With this approach, you avoid all of the technical, confusing and boring stuff, and you present Bitcoin as the sexy and irresistible offer that it is, all within a few minutes’ time.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by SV.

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Matt Maraia, </em><em>a CPA focused on how changes to accounting regulations impact the Bitcoin community.</em></p><p>Today, companies spend egregious amounts of money on credit card fees when processing customer payments, ultimately cutting into margins that are widely scrutinized by investors and management alike. </p><p>But the Lightning Network presents a new payment solution with the ability to process instantaneous payments (using Bitcoin) for virtually no fees. It boasts equivalent decentralized safeguards to the Bitcoin network, ultimately using Bitcoin’s blockchain, which has not been hacked since its inception in 2009. While doubt among the general public about bitcoin manifests itself in the asset’s price volatility, this innovative technology built on top of “Bitcoin rails” poses a unique opportunity for CEOs and CFOs to improve profitability. </p><p>In fact, you can be anti-Bitcoin and still be able to extract the advantages of the Lightning Network into your company’s payment processes, avoiding the issues of bitcoin price variability. </p><p>Here are some of the biggest advantages of adopting the Lightning Network for businesses:</p><h2>Improving Margins, Reducing Fees </h2><p>With<a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/jenny-craig-planning-mass-layoffs-shutting-down-weight-loss-centers"> mass layoffs</a> circulating the market, investors and managers understandably continue to scrutinize margins — every dollar matters and can spell disaster without proper planning and foresight. </p><p>The Lightning Network helps to alleviate these pressures by way of minimal transaction fees. On average, payments made via credit card amount to <a href="https://thepaymentsassociation.org/article/bitcoin-lightning-as-a-payment-rail/">about 3% in fees</a> owed to intermediary financial institutions. The Lightning Network opens up the possibility to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-lightning-network-is-1-000x-cheaper-than-visa-and-mastercard-data">process payments at a fraction of the cost</a> by using micropayment channels. While it is unlikely that an entire customer base will immediately transact through the Lightning Network, even transitioning 25% of credit card payments could significantly improve margins. </p><h2>Benefitting From Consistent Innovation </h2><p>Without delving into the superfluous details of how Lightning operates behind the scenes, the innovations materializing in the space remain frequent. </p><p>For example, <a href="https://www.ibexpay.io/">IBEX Pay</a> operates as a web application service that allows merchants to create an invoice on demand, generate a QR code to be scanned by the buyer with any Lightning wallet and process payment via Lightning instantaneously. Merchants can opt to receive payment based on the user-designated ratio of BTC to USD. </p><p>For companies with point-of-sale (PoS) terminals, S<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/industry-events/jack-mallers-adding-bitcoin-to-major-pos-networks">trike is developing Lightning Network compatibility for many of those</a> while offering similar benefits to the IBEX Pay platform in both efficiency and cost effectiveness. And most of these services do not require monthly subscription fees. </p><h2>Instant Settlement </h2><p>Another benefit of using the Lightning Network is a near-immediate settlement of funds. No longer are companies required to wait two to three business days for ACH/wire payments to settle to access capital via “fiat rails.” Intermediaries are removed with the use of the Lightning Network, permitting fast access to capital while limiting counterparty risk. </p><h2>A Built-In Customer Base </h2><p>Although customer bases are highly dependent on the goods or services offered by a company, there is a large contingent of Bitcoin supporters who prefer and often seek out vendors that operate directly or indirectly within the Bitcoin environment. </p><p>Many Bitcoin advocates use websites such as <a href="https://btcmap.org/">btcmap.org</a> and <a href="https://satmap.app/">satmap.app</a> to find businesses that accept bitcoin. Given that the Lightning Network is a layer built on top of the Bitcoin network, adopting it can provide you with an ever-growing, built-in customer base that is hungry to contribute to and share the successes of businesses operating under the Bitcoin umbrella. </p><h2>Limitations And Risks</h2><p>Still, the relative infancy of the Lightning Network means there are potential limitations and risks. </p><p>For instance, IBEX Pay <a href="https://www.ibexpay.io/support">currently offers a maximum $2,500 transaction size</a>. Additionally, and as with any new technology, while the network is gaining traction, there are still potential risks with bugs and other vulnerabilities. Recent traction in popularity has helped to lessen concerns over this proof of concept, but without decades of data points to lean on, there is no guarantee issues will not emerge. Lastly, a current lack of regulatory clarity in the digital asset realm could potentially lead to more questions later. </p><p>With all that said, the Lightning Network provides companies with a competitive advantage from a financial, operational and technological standpoint, though there are some concerns due to the relative infancy of the product in addition to existing limitations in current solutions. However, rather than standing by and suffering through the oncoming margin pressures that continue to infiltrate the economy, it is worthwhile to take action and adapt. </p><p>My recommendation for business owners out there is to trial run implementing this solution for at least a small segment of your business and to build out enough of a sample size to compare to current payment processes. What’s the worst-case scenario here? You are not reaping the benefits outlined herein, but you are without collateral damage to your business. The best? You are a first mover in a technology that aims to interrupt the payment processing space, coupled with increasing margins and gaining quicker access to customer payments. </p><p>The decision is yours. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Matt Maraia.

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Jason Maier, a teacher and author of “A Progressive’s Case For Bitcoin.” Disclaimer: This book was published by Bitcoin Magazine.</em></p><p>Does Bitcoin need progressives?</p><p>The simple answer to this question is no, Bitcoin doesn’t need progressives. We can all quote the memes by heart: Bitcoin doesn’t care. Tick tock, next block. Bitcoin is inevitable. Bitcoin can’t be regulated. I believe each of these mottos are true, in their own ways, in the long term. But recently, I have devoted a lot of energy to answering the converse of this question, namely: Do progressives need Bitcoin? </p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Progressives-Case-Bitcoin-Equitable-Peaceful/dp/B0C1J3DC2X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=BHMKM398V21S&amp;keywords=a+progressive%27s+case+for+bitcoin&amp;qid=1683039479&amp;sprefix=a+progressi%2Caps%2C92&amp;sr=8-1">My book</a> answers this more intricate question thoroughly in the affirmative. And while it’s easy to conclude, with confidence, that Bitcoin doesn’t <em>need</em> progressives, it might be interesting to consider why you should care at all that I’m on a mission to orange pill as many progressive liberals as I can. It’s true that Bitcoin doesn’t care. But I think you should.</p><h2>Shortening The Long Run</h2><p>As clear as it is to me that Bitcoin will ultimately succeed, it is also clear that the support of liberals and those on the left of the political spectrum, while not an absolute necessity, is important nonetheless. Even if Bitcoin is inevitable in the long run, there is an awful lot of time between now and the end of that long run. That time can be filled with growing adoption, innovation and promoting freedom money across the planet. Or that time can be filled with political fighting at every level of every government across the globe. Plenty of people reading this may not care, or they may even welcome the fighting. But in the long run, I’ll be dead and the world would be a better place if more people understood and used Satoshi Nakamoto’s innovation before my stack of corn gets passed along to my children. </p><p>There are Bitcoiners who do not align with me politically, but nonetheless support my work. These folks like to remind me that Bitcoin is money for enemies. This is not only true, but actually an important property of all “good” money. Furthermore, it is also critical to remember that, in this narrow sense, no Bitcoiner is your enemy, regardless of how they align themselves within the legacy political system. While left and right may fight about everything else, it is imperative that we unite when it comes to Bitcoin, because doing so provides our best opportunity to replace our current system <em>before</em> the end of the long term. </p><h2>Overhaul The System</h2><p>Like many people, my vision of bitcoin is that it is money for everyone. I also see it as the best tool we have to replace the corrupt, opaque and regressive global financial system which we have all inherited. At some point, the people who control the current system will actually start to fight Bitcoin and when they do, they will fight hard. The<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/02/28/1069190/ethereum-moved-to-proof-of-stake-why-cant-bitcoin/"> current environmental fear,uncertainty and doubt (FUD)</a> and the recent closing of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/banks-are-breaking-up-with-crypto-during-regulatory-crackdown-22de1832">fiat onramps to crypto exchanges</a> will look quaint in comparison. Powerful interests from Washington, D.C., to High Street will be able to pull their levers to make it difficult for any non-expert to learn about bitcoin, gain access to it or store it securely. Each of the players in the current game are incentivized to keep it running as long as possible and they have access to tremendous resources to help make that happen. Perhaps, for the first time, the issue isn’t powerful interests trying to make more money, it is the very definition of money itself. It will be a war and they will pull out all the stops.</p><p>Some Bitcoiners confidently claim that Bitcoin bans don’t matter because people are able to move to places where Bitcoin isn’t banned. If Bitcoin becomes illegal in some countries, or even some states within the U.S., we might have a chance to see how difficult jurisdictional arbitrage is in practice. Those with wealth and connections may be able to move to a different country that embraces Bitcoin. Those struggling to get by will be left behind. Even <a href="https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/wbd588-ted-cruz">Ted Cruz was dismissive</a> of the idea when he quipped to a Bitcoin audience recently, “How many folks here have your El Salvadoran passports?” </p><p>I don’t often agree with Cruz, but he is right. It’s hard to see how the emergency plan of everyone moving to El Salvador can fulfill the promise that “Bitcoin is for everybody” within my lifetime. </p><p>But perhaps the goal of those currently in power won’t be to make Bitcoin illegal, but instead to just keep us fighting about it from our entrenched and polarized political viewpoints. Since their goal is to protect the current system, they likely won’t start by outlawing their competition, but instead they would just keep people arguing about it. </p><p>The best outcome for those seeking to maintain the status quo is for the public to see Bitcoin as a right versus left issue, something else to divide people while those in charge continue to benefit from the current systems. And there is every reason to think that this will happen. Currently, there are a small number of <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/02/14/elizabeth-warren-anti-crypto-ftx-00082624">liberal politicians who regularly attempt to win political points by bashing Bitcoin</a>. If the tactic proves successful over time, others will add their voices to the chorus. On the flip side, some conservative legislators have rushed not only to support Bitcoin, but also highlight that the politicians on the left don’t. Eventually, all of the FUD, roadblocks and political fighting could reach a crescendo, at which point Bitcoin would start feeling a lot less inevitable.</p><h2>Make The War Impossible</h2><p>The window to get in front of this narrative is small and rapidly closing. My strong belief is that the secret to our collective success isn’t in convincing the politicians in power that Bitcoin is a force for good, but instead it’s in educating the citizens that vote for those politicians. We still have a chance to do so. Most pre-coiners just haven’t thought about Bitcoin a lot. I have seen that once people are given an opportunity to learn and ask questions, they are often convinced of Bitcoin’s value proposition. However the converse can also be true. If we get to the point where the government tries to ban Bitcoin, there will likely be a large swath of the population that will conclude that it must be bad. If public sentiment turns from “bitcoin is pretend money” to “Bitcoin is a bad thing for bad people,” it will be hard to unring that bell. Such an outcome doesn’t make Bitcoin’s success any less likely in the long run, but it can push back adoption, innovation, the building of infrastructure and education by decades. This would not only lock us in an outdated system, but also delay the real-life benefits that Bitcoin offers to the people who need this technology now. </p><p>Because of Bitcoin’s superior monetary properties, it will eventually win and become a preferred method of storing and transferring value among the world’s citizens. We know those currently in power are incentivized to fight Bitcoin. If given the chance, they will. But, even though we could win their war, we still have an opportunity to make such a war politically impossible in the first place. Doing so should be considered an imperative. <a href="https://www.swanbitcoin.com/ten-million-bitcoiners-the-intransigent-minority/">Cory Klippsten makes a similar argument</a>, employing <a href="https://medium.com/incerto/the-most-intolerant-wins-the-dictatorship-of-the-small-minority-3f1f83ce4e15">Nassim Taleb’s framework</a> of “The Intransigent Minority.” Klippsten’s claim is that if Bitcoin reaches 10 million supporters in the United States, that small but unmoving minority will make it practically impossible to fight the technology.</p><p>Even if imperfect, the schematic holds some intuitive value. Let’s say for the sake of argument that Klippsten’s 10 million number is correct. It would be foolish to think that we will reach that goal (in “<a href="https://www.swanbitcoin.com/the-race-to-avoid-the-war/">The Race To Avoid The War</a>”) without intentionally expanding the scope of our target audience. So far, progressives remain a fairly-untapped option for such an expansion. Further, our coalition of 10 million will be stronger and more antifragile if it is heterogeneous across the political spectrum. A robust coalition of Bitcoiners that spans the political spectrum will be impossible to ignore and harder to fight. This is why I, and many others like me, are bringing the case for Bitcoin to progressive people however we can. I think that should matter to you.</p><h2>Bitcoin Doesn’t Care, But You Should</h2><p>The world needs us to orange pill progressives. I very much want to reach Klippsten’s 10 million target and see the intransigent minority of Bitcoiners shape the future of money. The good news is that there is a growing catalog of Bitcoin educational resources offered through a progressive lens. There is also a growing and vocal progressive community within the Bitcoin space. Thanks to these tools, we have an opportunity, however fleeting, to reach more people and convince them of Bitcoin’s promise. And we need your help. </p><p>This is a call to action. Don’t shy away from conversations about Bitcoin with a liberal colleague, in-law or neighbor. Try to reach those people where they are and explain how Bitcoin addresses the unfairness they care about in the current system. Many progressives will respond well to an informed discussion about how and why Bitcoin addresses wealth inequality or gives property rights to marginalized groups of people. You may have more success than you think. If you’re unable to convince them yourself, direct them to appropriate books, podcasts and articles so they can continue their learning. </p><p>There is no doubt that we will eventually reach the tipping point when Bitcoin becomes inevitable. When that happens, it will be critical to have a variety of political ideologies represented in our coalition if we are to find the greatest success. The only unknown that remains is if we will act quickly enough to reach that tipping point before the war. I am optimistic that we will, and to that end I will continue to orange pill as many progressives as I can. I hope you will join me in that work.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Jason Maier.

    </figure><p>Bitdeer Technologies Group and Druk Holding &amp; Investments have partnered to develop a 100% carbon-free digital asset mining operation in the Kingdom of Bhutan. According to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, the partnership aims to help accelerate Bhutan's digital transformation and economic diversification, while expanding Bitdeer's global footprint. The two firms will establish a closed-end fund worth up to $500 million, which will launch in May 2023. Bitdeer will serve as the general partner, while DHI will act as a strategic limited partner.</p><p>“The Partnership is expected to create local jobs in areas ranging from engineering to project management, supervisory and supportive functions,” the press release said. “At the same time, the Partnership is expected to generate economic activity and foreign-currency-denominated revenue for local communities and the country.”</p><p>Bitdeer's Chairman, Jihan Wu, said, "We are excited to be working alongside DHI in accessing Bhutan's zero-emissions power to sustainably enable the blockchain technologies that will eventually form an immutable bedrock for a global store of value." <br><br>“We are thrilled to partner with Bitdeer on this important development for DHI.” Ujjwal Deep Dahal, CEO of Druk Holding and Investments, commented. "DHI exists for the betterment of the lives of Bhutanese people today and for generations to follow."</p><p>Bitdeer currently operates data centers in Northern Europe and North America. As the press release notes, the upcoming carbon-free bitcoin mining operation in Bhutan will mark a crucial expansion into Asia for Bitdeer, which “will enable Bitdeer to tap into Asia's abundant resources, contributing to the flourishing regional ecosystem.”</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgyMDU1MzM1MTk5MDU3MDI3/bitcoin-numbers.jpg"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[North Carolina County Enacts One-Year Ban On Commercial Bitcoin Mining, But Not Without Pushback]]></title><description><![CDATA[After a public hearing, Buncombe County voted to approve a moratorium on bitcoin mining in order to craft zoning standards and regulations for special land use.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/north-carolina-county-enacts-one-year-ban-on-bitcoin-mining</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/north-carolina-county-enacts-one-year-ban-on-bitcoin-mining</guid><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[Ban]]></category><category><![CDATA[Regulation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[Legal]]></category><category><![CDATA[Legislation]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Craig Deutsch]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 03 May 2023 17:35:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgzMjM5NTgzMDQyMTE4Njk0/img_6164.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

    </figure><p>As <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/north-carolina-county-pushes-forward-with-plan-to-halt-bitcoin-mining">first covered</a>&nbsp;in Bitcoin Magazine on April 6, Buncombe County, North Carolina proposed a one-year moratorium on bitcoin mining and held a public hearing on May 2.</p><p>The text of the proposal stated that the <a href="https://www.buncombecounty.org/common/Commissioners/20230404/Crypto%20Mining%20Temp%20Moratorium%20more%20info.pdf">moratorium</a>, if approved, would go into effect the same day as the hearing, so it was readily apparent that the County Commission was simply following procedure when taking comments from the public.</p><p>Unlike other moratoriums in the state where <a href="https://www.claycountyprogress.com/local/no-commercial-crypto-mining-allowed">no objections were voiced</a>, people throughout the region spoke out in opposition.&nbsp;State associations and local Bitcoiners came together in a collaborative effort to speak&nbsp;to various concerns about the one-year ban on commercial bitcoin mines.&nbsp;</p><p>Comments in support of Bitcoin ranged from safeguarding financial freedom, strengthening the grid through demand response programs, investment and use of sustainable energy, protecting first amendment rights, encouraging innovation and more.</p><p>There were three people in attendance that expressed their approval of the ban, citing concerns about noise and a desire to conserve energy usage in order to meet Governor Roy Cooper’s climate goals.</p><p>The moratorium passed unanimously.</p><p>From the Buncombe County website:</p><blockquote><p>“The Buncombe County Board of Commissioners is moving forward with a moratorium on cryptocurrency mining. Commissioners approved the one-year ban after holding a public hearing during their meeting on May 2. The County’s current ordinances do not define cryptocurrency mining as a specific use. Cryptocurrency mining operations can negatively affect surrounding neighborhoods due to excessive energy use, e-waste, pollution, and noise.

Fedi seeks to empower individuals to collaborate through "federations" made up of friends, families, neighbors, nonprofit organizations, social clubs, businesses, conferences and other forms of community to take control of their money, data and digital lives while protecting user privacy and autonomy. <br><br>The open-source Fedimint protocol, on which Fedi is built, makes it easy for developers to build additional apps and modules to complement Fedi's offerings and give more options to users. “It provides a resilient, privacy-protecting, and simple way for people who don’t have access to or don’t trust centralized alternatives to secure and use their data and money,” a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine explained.</p><p>The financing round was led by Ego Death Capital, with participation from Block, Kingsway, Trammell Venture Partners and Timechain, among others. This funding brings Fedi's total funding to $21.21 million. Fedi CEO Obi Nwosu said that the interest in the round allowed them to select investors that are fully aligned with the future they are trying to create with Fedi.</p><p>Fedi's community or "second-party" custody model offers a secure alternative to third-party cryptocurrency exchanges, cloud backup services and encrypted messaging apps. The system's underlying technology is readymade for rapid expansion and can be adapted to do virtually all the things people currently use their smartphone or computer to do. The system aims to answer the security, privacy and trust deficiencies of current alternatives, bringing users benefits similar to self-custody without technical or financial barriers to entry. </p><p>“Fedi is offering a truly decentralized and federated way not only to custody bitcoin but to take back control of everything that matters in your digital life,” said Jeff Booth, co-founder of Ego Death Capital and lead investor for this series. “It’s hard to overstate what this combination of technologies makes possible, and while I expect Fedi to be at the forefront, I’m just as excited by what people are going to build around it. It is truly something that can bring value and a brighter future for billions of people,” he added.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzODM5Njc4ODI5MzcyOTEy/network-nodes.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Biden Administration Proposes 30% Tax On Energy Used By Bitcoin Miners]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Digital Asset Mining Energy excise tax would harm businesses and push innovation out of the United States.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/biden-administration-proposes-30-tax-on-energy-used-by-bitcoin-miners</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/biden-administration-proposes-30-tax-on-energy-used-by-bitcoin-miners</guid><category><![CDATA[White House]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[Biden Administration]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[United States]]></category><category><![CDATA[Taxes]]></category><category><![CDATA[Legal]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 03 May 2023 16:06:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgyMzg4OTgzNTU5NDk3MDMy/usa.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

    </figure><p>The President's new budget proposal for Fiscal Year 2024 includes the Digital Asset Mining Energy (DAME) excise tax, which would require bitcoin mining firms to pay 30% of the cost of electricity used for mining crypto assets. This tax aims to address what the White House claims are the economic and environmental costs of mining, citing local pollution, increased greenhouse gas emissions and higher energy prices.</p><p>Unfortunately, the proposal does not take into account the large mix of renewable energy sources being used to power bitcoin mining, which <a href="https://bitcoinminingcouncil.com/bitcoin-mining-electricity-mix-increased-to-59-5-sustainable-in-q2-2022/">Bitcoin Mining Council research</a> shows continues to grow, making up more than half of the energy utilized by miners. In addition, it does not consider the grid-strengthening benefits that Bitcoin mining can offer, which has been <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/12/06/texas-bitcoin-miners-are-offered-to-cut-electricity-usage-to-help-the-grid/">seen</a> in states like <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-mining-fits-texas-energy-grid">Texas</a>. </p><p>The recent announcement of the DAME tax is yet another example of government overreach and intervention in the private sector. The proposal is just another tax grab by the government, disguised as an effort to address environmental concerns.</p><p>While it is true that mining consumes energy, it is not the responsibility of the government to dictate how businesses operate or what is a good and bad use of energy. The government should not be punishing businesses for pursuing innovation and technological advancement. The DAME tax is nothing more than a blatant attempt to stifle innovation in the Bitcoin industry and limit the potential for economic growth.</p><p>Furthermore, the government's claim that Bitcoin mining imposes costs on others is unfounded. Bitcoin mining firms already pay for the electricity they use, and any negative externalities are mitigated by the fact that they often locate in areas with excess or <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/renewable-energy">renewable</a> energy. The argument that mining firms impose costs on low-income neighborhoods and communities of color is simply fearmongering and lacks any empirical evidence.</p><p>In fact, the DAME tax could have negative consequences for these same communities. The tax could cause firms to move their operations overseas, resulting in job losses and decreased economic activity in the United States. Moreover, the tax could create risks for local electrical grids who now benefit from the increased production and instant shut-off ability of miners. </p><p>It is clear that the government is targeting the mining industry because it is a new and innovative technology that is disrupting traditional financial systems.</p><p>The DAME tax is a misguided attempt by the government to stifle innovation in the Bitcoin industry and generate revenue under the guise of environmental protection. The tax is hypocritical, lacks any empirical evidence and could have negative unintended consequences for communities and consumers. The government should focus on creating a regulatory environment that supports innovation and economic growth, rather than imposing arbitrary taxes on businesses.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgyMzg4OTgzNTU5NDk3MDMy/usa.jpg"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[MoonPay Launches App In More Than 130 Countries]]></title><description><![CDATA[MoonPay is now offering its multi-wallet management solution via the app store in countries across the globe.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/moonpay-launches-app-in-more-than-130-countries</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/moonpay-launches-app-in-more-than-130-countries</guid><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[app]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Wallets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Moonpay]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 03 May 2023 15:37:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg5ODc3NDQ5NjI5MTE2MTU4/20220531_btcfinal_best-make-your-ln-node-mobile---anthony-feliciano.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Carlos Cárdenas, an institutional account manager who has worked at legacy banks and cryptocurrency exchanges.</em></p><p>Argentina is on the verge of financial collapse as record inflation and Argentine peso (ARS) devaluation hits the market. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/steve_hanke/status/1650492285539471360?s=20">research</a> from Steve Hanke, a professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University, the peso has depreciated 47% against the U.S. dollar (UD) and inflation is running higher than <a href="https://twitter.com/steve_hanke/status/1647792706725490688">118%</a> per year. His solution: dollarize the Argentine economy. </p><p>While dollarization is already in play in Argentina to some extent (many Argentinians save in dollars and accept dollars at their businesses) the peso is still the de facto currency of the country. The <a href="https://bluedollar.net/informal-rate/">Dólar Blue</a> rate, an informal measure of the cost of buying and selling a physical dollar bill in Argentina, has risen 23 times since 2018. At the time of this writing, it sits at 465 ARS to 1 USD. Factors such as the rising costs of living, bad economic practices and the COVID-19 pandemic have led to this outcome for Argentina. </p><p>Pundits, politicians and local citizens are advocating for full-fledged dollarization as the solution, but is this the best method, or can we find something better? Given the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/as-banks-collapse-bitcoin-is-stronger">inherent problems with the USD</a>, perhaps a hybrid approach that implements the superior qualities of Bitcoin, could serve Argentina better.</p><h2>A Case Study In Ecuador</h2><p>To analyze this, let's take a look at Ecuador, which was one of the first Latin American countries to leave its national currency, the sucre, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998%E2%80%931999_Ecuador_economic_crisis">adopt U.S. dollars in 1999</a>. </p><p>By the end of 1999, <a href="https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/The-Case-of-Ecuador.pdf">inflation in Ecuador had reached 60%</a> and the sucre had <a href="https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_emp/documents/publication/wcms_364613.pdf">devalued by about 300%</a>. To prevent bank failures, the government <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998%E2%80%931999_Ecuador_economic_crisis">shut down banks and started to “rescue” the financial system</a>. As expected, this did not work and not only did poverty explode in the country, but the monetary base expanded by <a href="https://fee.org/articles/celebrating-ecuador-s-dollarization/#:~:text=Ecuador%20entered%20dollarization%20under%20a,of%20devaluation%20exceeded%20300%20percent.">552%</a>. Consequently, Ecuadorian citizens abandoned the sucre and, by 2000, the government officially adopted the U.S. dollar as legal tender. The short-term consequences for dollarization were dire: people lost their entire lives’ savings, some committed suicide and many left the country to work in the United States and in Europe. That immediate cost caused the government to collapse and the country to suffer a depression that, eventually, it recovered from.</p><p>Fast forward and, as a result of dollarization, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2536238">the real GDP of Ecuador grew by 75% in total from 2000 to 2013, while the inflation and interest rates dropped</a>. This might have seemed like a happy ending, but due to corruption and mismanagement of resources, the full economic potential of Ecuador was never realized and <a href="https://www.heritage.org/index/country/ecuador#:~:text=Ecuador's%20economic%20freedom%20score%20is,the%20world%20and%20regional%20averages.">today it has a below-average economy</a>. </p><p>Dollarization was very successful in Ecuador, such that it continuously posed a threat to politicians and central bankers. They no longer had the power to manipulate a currency so, with the inspiration of blockchain technology, came up with a program to develop a central bank digital currency (CBDC) through a fintech program called “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666143821000107">Dinero Electrónico</a>” between 2014 and 2018. Because there were no effective data controls, this program allowed the government to print more dollars and allow users to transact via their phones, thus creating a currency that operated in parallel to the dollar. This added to privacy concerns and a lack of trust that drove the program to crash and burn.</p><h2>Lessons Learned For Argentina</h2><p>Seeing the initial success of the U.S. dollar in Ecuador, I do believe dollarization is the most prudent way that Argentina can go about fixing its monetary policy. However, Argentina can also officialize bitcoin as legal tender in order to reduce the immediate shock to the economy, modernize its financial system and offer its citizens alternatives. </p><p>Mere years ago, Bitcoin was non-existent. Today, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">Bitcoin has a market cap of well over $500 billion dollars</a> and it is leveraged by sovereign wealth funds, hedge funds, insurance firms, tech firms and retail users all across the globe. And while institutional adoption grows, so do business opportunities across borders. Bitcoin’s Lightning Network is now <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-lightning-network-is-1-000x-cheaper-than-visa-and-mastercard-data">1,000 times cheaper</a> to use than major credit card providers like Visa or Mastercard. The potential for businesses relying on international capital and remittances would be huge and bring trust to the country. </p><p>Argentina also already has one of the higher indices of crypto adoption in Latin America, with <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/latin-america-cryptocurrency-geography-report-2022-preview/">over 31%</a> of the retail-sized crypto transactions being conducted with stablecoins, a way for citizens to protect themselves from the ARS inflation. In addition, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/20/world/americas/argentina-cryptocurrency-value.html">over 60% of Argentinians</a> believe that BTC has capabilities as a store of value with the power to outperform the peso. </p><p>Most recently, Argentina’s Comisión Nacional de Valores, its national securities commission, authorized the launch of a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/04/12/argentinas-national-securities-commission-approves-bitcoin-futures/">bitcoin futures contract</a> that settles in ARS. In addition, bitcoin is up <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/BTC-ARS?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiE2t_-2cz-AhVohIkEHdKCCv8Q-fUHegQIFxAf&amp;window=YTD">105% year to date, as quoted in Argentine pesos</a>, reflecting the conviction that both citizens and the government have in the orange coin. </p><p>There are many challenges that could slow down Bitcoin adoption in Argentina, such as the lack of infrastructure or regulatory clarity. Nonetheless, with a population that is already highly educated in crypto assets and in need of a lifeboat, Bitcoin-hybrid dollarization might prove to be a better experience than Ecuador’s. In addition, incorporation of Bitcoin adoption would deliver a better social contract between the government and its citizens. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Carlos Cárdenas.
