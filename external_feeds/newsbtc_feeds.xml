					<description><![CDATA[Solana has been on a freefall since the collapse of FTX and has not been able to move upwards because of the FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) surrounding the ecosystem and its connections with the former crypto exchange. According to recent news, Solana’s native token SOL has dropped 51.14% since the day FTX fell from grace.  Solana: Dead Or Not Dead?  The current situation might be confusing to investors. Based on data by CoinGeko, the token shot up by 5.4% in the past 24 hours which might be a signal that investor sentiment is reversing. However, the FUD still remains strong around the ecosystem itself.  Messari released an overview of the ecosystem back on December 15. The basic gist of the overview was that Solana is still a solid ecosystem even after the collapse of the Sam Bankman-Fried-led exchange. However, recent Santiment insight on the ecosystem shows that it might be already dead.  The most notable on-chain development for the token was the significant drop in developer activity despite a lot of projects being developed on the ecosystem. Although it is difficult to say whether Solana as a whole is dead or near it, it is easier to say that the ecosystem is struggling to keep itself afloat because of its close ties with FTX.  Image: Coincu News What This Means For Holders Of SOL The crypto community seems to be very bearish at the moment considering what transpired in the past weeks courtesy of some major macroeconomics news, including the spate of job cuts and bankruptcies by big crypto firms. Those who are bullish for the ecosystem point to ETH’s crash back in 2018 and how SOL’s movement mimics this.  For everyone that sold #ETH in 2018 for 88 USD and for everyone who is selling $SOL sub 10 USD!

					<description><![CDATA[2022 is coming to an end, and our staff at NewsBTC decided to launch this Crypto Holiday Special to provide some perspective on the crypto industry. We will talk with multiple guests to understand this year’s highs and lows for crypto. Related Reading: A Crypto Holiday Special: Past, Present, And Future With Ex BNY Mellon David Schwed In the spirit of Charles Dicken’s classic, “A Christmas Carol,” we’ll look into crypto from different angles, look at its possible trajectory for 2023 and find common ground amongst these different views of an industry that might support the future of finances. Over the last week, we spoke with institutions about their perception of 2022 and their outlook for the coming months. We’ll begin our experts round with Material Indicators, a market data, and analytics firm dedicated to building trading tools for the nascent sector. Material Indicators: “While we have yet to see tradfi (Traditional Finances) price in earnings contraction (~Q1&#8217;23) for the last leg down, we are already close to bottoming sentiment-wise.” Material Indicators and their team of analyst gauge market sentiment and liquidity and try to read between the lines of what big players are doing to provide a clear view, absent of noise, about its conditions and possible direction. This is what they told us: Q: What’s the most significant difference for the crypto market today compared to Christmas 2021? Beyond the price of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others, what changed from that moment of euphoria to today’s perpetual fear? Has there been a decline in adoption and liquidity? Are fundamentals still valid? A: The difference is striking! Since the FTX blowup, the influx of new people to Crypto Twitter has been reduced to a trickle. Salty Youtubers will now advise you to sell your remaining coins to avoid a total loss. Telegram communities have been shrinking. Big accounts who&#8217;ve been telling their followers to buy have either quit or rebranded. While we have yet to see tradfi (Traditional Finances) price in earnings contraction (~Q1&#8217;23) for the last leg down, we are already close to bottoming sentiment-wise. Q: What are the dominant narratives driving this change in market conditions? And what should be the narrative today? What are most people overlooking? We saw a major crypto exchange blowing up, a hedge fund thought to be untouchable, and an ecosystem that promised a financial utopia. Is Crypto still the future of finance, or should the community pursue a new vision? A: It&#8217;s the other way around. Conditions create narratives. Loose monetary policy and abundant cheap credit create bubbles and nurture fraud. It&#8217;s only after the tide recedes that we see who has been swimming naked. With an imminent rise in unemployment, people will try to hide in bonds, which actually improves credit-availability for risk assets. So, while earnings-driven assets will feel pain on higher unemployment, credit-driven assets (risk assets) will feel relatively less pain. Q: If you must choose one, what do you think was a significant moment for crypto in 2022? And will the industry feel its consequences across 2023? Where do you see the industry next Christmas? Will it survive this winter? Mainstream is once again declaring the death of the industry. Will they finally get it right? A: Terra/Luna was probably the catalyst for all the subsequent blowups and we have yet to see the full effects of contagion (DCG/Grayscale/Genesis are not fully resolved yet). As with any blowup, this will just invite more regulation that will neither protect investors, nor improve the potential for growth. We wanted institutional adoption and now we see that they had zero risk-management and gambled away their user funds. Related Reading: A Crypto Holiday Special: Past, Present, And Future With Blofin Q: Finally, across social media, you guys at Material Indicators made your bearish bias public. Are you more or less pessimistic than you were at the beginning of 2022? And what will you like to see to shift your bias and lean towards the long side of the market? We know a lot depends on the Federal Reserve, are the chances of a pivot and lower interest rates hikes higher? A: While we&#8217;re probably not quite out of the woods yet, we can already almost see the light. On poor earnings &#38; poor forecasts bonds will likely catch a bid in Q1&#8217;23, and therefore make credit available to risk assets to dampen their fall or even help them recover (especially if the Treasury manages to relieve the RRP of its ~$2T idle liquidity). Bitcoin could also benefit from this as it&#8217;s only subject to credit-availability and not earnings. However, while inflation has been and will likely continue to fall for some time, it is unlikely that we&#8217;ve seen the last of it. So, keep an eye out for potentially re-surging inflation sometime in late-&#8217;23/early-&#8217;24.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The year 2023 is said to be huge for Polkadot (DOT) as it is one of the cryptocurrencies to watch out for. Many crypto experts are very optimistic about Polkadot, and they’re saying that traders should keep an eye on the coin because its developments will be big for that year. DOT is looking bearish but can pivot to a bull run in the coming days Polkadot is said to be an attractive addition to the investment portfolio for 2023 DOT price is down by 1.43% While DOT isn’t performing well as of press time, crypto experts believe that this is the best time to buy. The coin is regarded as one of the safety nets and best bets to include in your portfolio for next year. According to CoinMarketCap, DOT price is down by 1.43% or trading at $4.28 as of this writing. And many crypto experts think that the discounted price should entice more traders to buy while the prices are still low because it’s bound to spike by next year. Polkadot: One Of The Most Liquid Assets Even though Polkadot has depreciated in value, it’s still the top-rated crypto in terms of capturing investor interest. It stands out when pitted with other cryptos as it’s also one of the popular liquid assets included in hedge fund portfolios. Indeed, there is an increasing demand for Polkadot, and it is seen to have the most potential to rise in 2023. In fact, as early as now, many top investment companies and even hedge funds are putting most of their eggs on the Polkadot basket. Related Reading: Hedera: Is 2023 The Comeback Year For HBAR NFTs?

This retreat has attracted investors in the past, and it may also draw them in now. On the other hand, DOT’s technical indicators hint at some bullish movement, with its volume reached a new low as registered on December 25. Still, it is now slowly recovering from the slump.

Meanwhile, Polkadot, along with Cardano and Algorand, is among the most eco-friendly cryptocurrencies, according to a new analysis by the Traders of Crypto. Polkadot ranks as the fourth most eco-friendly digital money, with annual carbon emissions of 50 tons. &#8211; Featured image: VOI]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin investor sentiment has reached a standstill amid struggling prices in the market. While the digital asset continues to hold the $16,000 level, investors have backed off from the market, ensuring no significant movements either up or down, and as a result, investor sentiment hasn’t moved. Bitcoin Investors Still In Fear The crypto Fear &#38; Greed Index shows that bitcoin investor sentiment hasn’t really moved much in the last month. It closed out the month of November at a score of 29 which put it right in the fear territory but since then has been unable to break out of this trend.  Related Reading: Solana Suffers Double-Digit Losses, Is There An End In Sight? The score on this index over the month of December has staggered between 26-30 for the most part, maintaining a nearly straight-line trend during this period. Even now, the Fear &#38; Greed Index sits at a score of 28 and is up one point from last week’s close of 27. Fear &#38; Greed Index trends in an almost straight line &#124; Source: alternative.me What this trend in the Fear &#38; Greed Index shows is that bitcoin investors are not willing to take any risk. This is why the index has been unable to move into the greed territory. On the flip side, sell sentiment has not been as strong as expected during a time like this. If investors were selling more of their bitcoin, then it would have been obvious given that the index would slide further down. Instead, it continues to maintain a near-consistent score level, meaning hold sentiment now dominates the market. Will BTC See A Recovery Soon? Bitcoin is still finding a hard time regaining the momentum it has lost over the past month. This hesitancy from investors to do anything with their tokens has seen the price of the digital asset follow the same path as sentiment. BTC has now refused to move out of the $16,000 price level.

So it is likely that the last two days of the year 2022 will follow this same trend. Recovery should not be expected in any way because momentum will continue to decline as people take a break from the markets to celebrate with family.

Anything below this level would be very bearish and could trigger more declines in the market as bears take control. But a finish above $16,000 strengthens investors’ resolve to hold their coins. BTC is changing hands at a price of $16,519 at the time of this writing. Its price is down 0.43% in the last 24 hours and 2.01% in the last 7 days.

					<description><![CDATA[It has been a rough year for Bitcoin and most major altcoins. Over the last 24 hours, Bitcoin lost 1% of its value, which points towards consolidated price action. BTC has not made much progress over the past week either, as the coin only lost 1.6% of its market value. For multiple weeks, the coin has been oscillating between $16,400 and $18,000. The closest support line for the coin stood at $16,000. The technical outlook for Bitcoin depicted mundane price action due to a decline in the buying strength on the one-day chart. Since the price of Bitcoin has remained undecided for quite some time now, sellers have flooded the market, indicating that the coin is headed toward another round of depreciation. The trading volume of Bitcoin has declined considerably, reinforcing that bears were in charge of the asset&#8217;s price. If the selling pressure keeps mounting, BTC will soon lose its crucial price level of $16,000. Currently, BTC is down 76% from its all-time high, secured in 2021. Related Reading: Ethereum Finishes 2022 With ATH Correlation To Bitcoin, Despite The Merge Bitcoin Price Analysis: One-Day Chart BTC was trading at $16,550 at the time of writing. Bitcoin was trading close to its immediate support level of $16,000. Going by the technical outlook, the coin might undergo further depreciation before it starts to reverse its price action. Overhead resistance for Bitcoin was $16,900; clearing this could help the crypto reach $17,400 and eventually attempt to breach $18,000. On the flip side, if Bitcoin moves below the current price mark, it will fall through $16,000 and exceed $15,800. The amount of Bitcoin traded in the last session declined, indicating a fall in buying strength for the asset. Technical Analysis BTC traders might again witness a fall in asset prices over the upcoming trading sessions. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) was below the half-line, near the 40-mark, which indicates that sellers outnumbered buyers heavily. RSI had also noted a downtick, signifying further loss of value. Similarly, the BTC price was below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, which signals that sellers were driving the price momentum in the market. The SMA also formed a death cross; it is formed when a longer moving average line crosses over a shorter moving average line; in this case, the 50-SMA line was above the 20-SMA line. This sign on the chart is accompanied by the bears strengthening in the market. Other technical indicators have also pointed out that sellers are here to stay a little longer. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicates price momentum and reversals. MACD depicted a sell signal as the indicator noted red signal bars after undergoing a bearish crossover. The sell signal could mean that the price would depreciate further. The Directional Movement Index, which portrays the price direction, was negative. The -DI (orange) line was above the +DI (blue) line. The Average Directional Index (red) was near the 20-mark with an uptick, emphasizing that bearish action could gain momentum over the immediate trading sessions.

					<description><![CDATA[The Polygon (MATIC) price has been on a downward spiral for the last couple of weeks. Over the last 24 hours, MATIC lost 4% of its value. The altcoin has also lost about 6% in the last week. Earlier in November, MATIC touched the $1.20 price mark and plunged significantly. Since the coin plummeted in November, the Polygon price has noted a freefall in its value. Going by the technical outlook on the daily chart, buyers are nowhere to be found. It will be difficult for MATIC to sustain itself above its immediate support level. The buying strength of Polygon has to increase considerably for it to remain above the local support line. Over the past month, the coin has breached several important price floors. After trading sideways for a while, MATIC lost buyers further, which made the coin fall on its chart again. For Polygon, the most important price floor currently stands at $0.74. If MATIC loses that support line, the coin can register a significant decline of 14%. The market capitalization of MATIC also declined over the past few weeks, which depicts bearishness for the coin. Currently, the coin is trading 74% below its all-time high secured one year ago. Related Reading: Most Public Crypto Firms Underperformed Bitcoin In 2022, Miners Hit Worst MATIC Price Analysis: One-Day Chart Polygon was trading at $0.76 at the time of writing. The coin was trading extremely close to the immediate support line of $0.74; one push from the sellers and the price could take another significant bearish turn. Overhead resistance for MATIC was $0.81; crossing this price level will help the altcoin reach $0.84. The $0.84 level has previously acted as a propelling point for the asset&#8217;s price, so this could mean that moving above the $0.84 level would help the coin reverse its price action. On the other hand, a fall from the present price mark will bring the altcoin to $0.67 and then to $0.63. The amount of Polygon traded in the last session was red, indicating selling dominance. Technical Analysis The coin was in the seller&#8217;s dominant zone for most of this month. The coin barely recovered after it lost the $0.84 support line. The Relative Strength Index was below the 40-mark, which depicted that the coin received more sellers than buyers. In correspondence with the same, the coin moved below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line. This meant that the sellers were driving the price momentum in the market. Usually, when the coin hovers too close to the oversold zone, the price reverses. If demand returns, the coin will move above the 200-SMA line (green), which points towards a potential rally. Regarding selling strength, the indicators pointed out that the selling spree is not over yet. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator depicts price momentum and reversals. MACD showed red signal bars, which are tied to a sell signal. This was an indication that the coin could dip further on the chart. The Chaikin Money Flow reads capital inflows and outflows; the indicator was below the half-line, signifying lower capital inflows than outflows.

<p>The coin was in the seller&#8217;s dominant zone for most of this month. The coin barely recovered after it lost the $0.84 support line. The Relative Strength Index was below the 40-mark, which depicted that the coin received more sellers than buyers.</p>
<p>In correspondence with the same, the coin moved below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line. This meant that the sellers were driving the price momentum in the market.</p>
<p>Usually, when the coin hovers too close to the oversold zone, the price reverses. If demand returns, the coin will move above the 200-SMA line (green), which points towards a potential rally.</p>

<p>Regarding selling strength, the indicators pointed out that the selling spree is not over yet. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator depicts price momentum and reversals. MACD showed red signal bars, which are tied to a sell signal.</p>
<p>This was an indication that the coin could dip further on the chart. The Chaikin Money Flow reads capital inflows and outflows; the indicator was below the half-line, signifying lower capital inflows than outflows.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Data shows Ethereum&#8217;s year of high correlation with Bitcoin is coming to an end with the metric hitting ATH values. Ethereum Ends 2022 With All-Time High Correlation To Bitcoin According to the year-end report from Arcane Research, the global markets have all fallen strongly correlated this year. The &#8220;30-day correlations&#8221; is an indicator that measures how in-tune Bitcoin has been with another asset in terms of price movement over a 30-day period. When the value of this metric is greater than zero, it means there has been a positive correlation between BTC and the other asset in the past month. On the other hand, negative values imply that the price of the crypto has been reacting to changes in the value of the other asset by moving in the opposite direction. Also, the higher the metric value (in either direction), the more the degree of the correlation. Naturally, the metric has a value equal to zero suggesting the two prices aren&#8217;t tied to each other at the moment.

BTC&#8217;s correlation has been around or above 0.5 for most of the year for the US equities, suggesting it has been decently tied with them. The correlation with Ethereum, however, has been at values of around 0.9 or more, implying Bitcoin has been extremely correlated with it. Even now, as the year&#8217;s end, the correlation between these cryptos stands at 0.97, around ATH levels. Back in September of this year, ETH successfully finished its much-anticipated transition to a Proof-of-Stake consensus system, an event known as the Merge. Since the Merge brought some developments unique to Ethereum, the correlation with BTC dropped, as is apparent in the chart. However, it wasn&#8217;t long before the two started moving on the same wavelength again, so even the Merge wasn&#8217;t enough to cause sufficient impact to separate the coins.

<h2>Ethereum Ends 2022 With All-Time High Correlation To Bitcoin</h2>
<p>According to the year-end report from <a href="https://arcane.no/research/2022-year-in-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arcane Research</a>, the global markets have all fallen strongly correlated this year. The &#8220;<a href="https://newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-moves-us-stock-market-correlation-weakening/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30-day correlations</a>&#8221; is an indicator that measures how in-tune Bitcoin has been with another asset in terms of price movement over a 30-day period.</p>
<p>When the value of this metric is greater than zero, it means there has been a positive correlation between BTC and the other asset in the past month. On the other hand, negative values imply that the price of the crypto has been reacting to changes in the value of the other asset by moving in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Also, the higher the metric value (in either direction), the more the degree of the correlation. Naturally, the metric has a value equal to zero suggesting the two prices aren&#8217;t tied to each other at the moment.</p>

<p>Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in Bitcoin&#8217;s 30-day correlations with Ethereum, S&amp;P 500, and Nasdaq over the past year:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-514298 size-full aligncenter" src="https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/chart-41.png" alt="Bitcoin And Ethereum Correlation" width="771" height="518" srcset="https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/chart-41.png 771w, https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/chart-41-460x309.png 460w, https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/chart-41-768x516.png 768w, https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/chart-41-750x504.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 771px) 100vw, 771px" /></p>

<p>As the above graph displays, Bitcoin positively correlated with these three assets during 2022. BTC&#8217;s correlation has been around or above 0.5 for most of the year for the US equities, suggesting it has been decently tied with them.</p>
<p>The correlation with Ethereum, however, has been at values of around 0.9 or more, implying Bitcoin has been extremely correlated with it. Even now, as the year&#8217;s end, the correlation between these cryptos stands at 0.97, around ATH levels.</p>
<p>Back in September of this year, ETH successfully finished its much-anticipated transition to a Proof-of-Stake consensus system, an event known as the <a href="https://newsbtc.com/news/company/the-ethereum-merge-what-is-trading-headed-towards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Merge</a>.

					<description><![CDATA[2022 is coming to an end, and our staff at NewsBTC decided to launch this Crypto Holiday Special to provide some perspective on the crypto industry. We will talk with multiple guests to understand this year’s highs and lows for crypto. Related Reading: A Crypto Holiday Special: Past, Present, And Future With Ex BNY Mellon David Schwed In the spirit of Charles Dicken’s classic, “A Christmas Carol,” we’ll look into crypto from different angles, look at its possible trajectory for 2023 and find common ground amongst these different views of an industry that might support the future of finances. Zhou: “It won’t be business as usual for centralized exchanges. For one, the days of commingling users and the exchanges’ assets are long gone.” We are ending our institutional round with Wei Zhou; he worked as Chief Financial Officer for three years at the largest crypto exchange worldwide, Binance. Above the rest, this company and its current CEO, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, heavily impacted the nascent industry and will continue to exercise influence in the coming years. Zhou: “Bitcoin, just like the Internet, will survive any storm that comes its way; this I have no inkling of doubt about.” Zhou reviews the biggest moment in 2022 from his unique perspective. In addition, he talks about the fundamentals that will keep crypto alive and on track to fulfill its destiny. This is what he told us: Q: What’s the most significant difference for the crypto market today compared to Christmas 2021? Beyond the price of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others, what changed from that moment of euphoria to today’s perpetual fear? Has there been a decline in adoption and liquidity? Are fundamentals still valid? A: The crypto market has certainly changed a lot in the past year. Collapse of key industry players I think the biggest change this year has been due to the collapse of some key industry players, from Celsius, 3AC to BlockFi and most recently FTX. With billions of dollars affected, investors have become cautious. The collapse of these giants has served to remind us to be prudent and diligent with our crypto investment decisions. Users should conduct thorough research and abstain from entities whose licensing and regulatory status is unclear. I believe that the situation will change in 2023 and that investor confidence will resume, but we can’t afford to forget the lessons learned this year. Liquidity affected but adoption will continue to grow With the collapse of a big market maker like FTX, liquidity in the market was affected as several exchanges relied on it. Investors have also pulled quite a bit of their money from exchanges which further escalated the liquidity crunch.  Speculative trading may have pulled back, but for those to whom crypto was more focused on use cases like value transfer, web3 gaming and financial inclusion, crypto adoption will continue to surge especially in the Philippines. Q: What are the dominant narratives driving this change in market conditions? And what should be the narrative today? What are most people overlooking? We saw a major crypto exchange blowing up, a hedge fund thought to be untouchable, and an ecosystem that promised a financial utopia. Is Crypto still the future of finance, or should the community pursue a new vision? A: This year’s market downturn has fueled crypto skeptics and several mainstream media houses who have become re-energized in their fight against crypto. This narrative has put doubts in the minds of investors. However, most people are overlooking that Bitcoin is designed to be a decentralized electronic currency. Crypto is still the future of finance. If you recall, when the dot-com bubble burst, there were all manner of questions about the viability of the Internet as a technology and the companies building on it. But look at Amazon, Facebook, Google and others today &#8211; they are defining the world we live in. This is because, despite the shake-ups with the market players, the underlying technology was fundamentally transformative. Bitcoin, just like the Internet, will survive this winter. Q: If you must choose one, what do you think was a significant moment for crypto in 2022? And will the industry feel its consequences across 2023? Where do you see the industry next Christmas? Will it survive this winter? Mainstream is once again declaring the death of the industry. Will they finally get it right? A: I would point to the FTX collapse as a landmark moment. Its impact has been and will continue to be felt in the industry. Investors are keener about who they trust with their assets and how custodians and exchanges store the assets. Investors are now exploring self-custody solutions, which contrary to opinion I think is a great direction to take. When they require to trade their assets, they are now keen to work with exchanges that are fully regulated like Coins.ph which is licensed by the Philippines central bank and is regularly audited. Regulators are more concerned about the industry. We will also see a trend where regulators around the world will begin to create a more comprehensive regulatory framework around cryptocurrency. The crypto industry has gone through worse. In 2017, the crypto markets peaked and crashed to $3,000, and the industry endured a three-year-long crypto winter. In 2022, we now have institutional investors who are advancing the sector, unlike during prior winters. I believe the industry will survive because there are now much more use cases than there were in the past. Q: What&#8217;s next for exchanges such as Binance in 2023 and beyond? Do you think the recent events with FTX will jeopardize the future of these platforms? Many are already speculating about the shift in liquidity from Centralize to Decentralize Exchanges (DEX) due to the users&#8217; lack of confidence in the former A: The days of commingling users and the exchanges’ assets are long gone. FTX has woken up the entire industry to the dangers this practice can have. Proof of reserves is already becoming a big trend as more investors ask questions about how and where their assets are stored. Related Reading: A Crypto Holiday Special: Past, Present, And Future With Blofin Regulators are also cracking down much harder on exchanges. In the Philippines, for instance, the BSP was quick to audit exchanges in order to probe if they had been exposed to the FTX contagion. Thankfully, neither Coins.ph nor our peers were exposed to FTX. The crypto industry will be shifting to focus on Web3, decentralized exchanges and self-custody. More users are now exploring wallets that give them full ownership of their crypto. I am a big supporter of self-custody for those with the technical ability to do it successfully. When they require trade, I would advise them to always use an exchange that’s licensed and supervised by a recognized national or regional watchdog.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The impact of bitcoin whales and their activities has always been felt in the general market. This goes from buying to selling, and just the way they move their coins. Once again, these whales still hold sway in the market and their activity could spell a bottom signal. Santiment Says Bitcoin Whales Are Selling In a recent community post on the Santiment website, the activity of whales is analyzed in depth. This time around, a look at the balances of large holders shows that they are still selling. These whales who hold between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC have reduced their holdings from almost 8 million BTC back in December 2021 to less than 7 million BTC in December 2022.

Given this sell trend among these large holders, the report predicts that the market will see “sideways or even lower prices for BTC in the next 6-12 months.” BTC whales are still selling &#124; Source: Santiment If this selling from large investors flows into 2023, then it is likely that the digital asset would start out the year seeing prices below $16,000. It is also important to note that the analysis in the report of whale addresses shows that the bottom of the market may not be reached yet. BTC Bottom Is Still Not In Now, the activity of whales is important to watch as accumulation by them could lead to a rally, and vice versa. One of the ways to try to pinpoint the bitcoin bottoms is with whale activity. At the very bottom of a bear market or at least close to it, whale address activities have historically declined. However, the Santiment report notes that the average 7-day transaction count was still hovering around 10,000 presently. Compared to the previous bear markets when the market had marked its bottom, whale transaction counts had declined to 1,200 and 2,500.  “This may mean that we need to wait for the average to drop further before we can conclude that even the big players are giving up,” the report reads.

These usually show where the whales are accumulating and unfortunately, both volume gaps identified in the report lie well below the current trading price of bitcoin. The two key gaps identified were the $14,600 and $12,200 price levels, which could be a possible accumulation level for whales.

Essentially, the advice was to put off buying until whale transactions fall lower, as well as wait for the current selling pressure to subside. “To sum up, the activity of BTC whales and the presence of volume gaps at 14,600 USD and 12,200 USD may be worth watching,” Santiment said.

					<description><![CDATA[Data shows almost all the big public crypto companies have underperformed Bitcoin this year, with the mining firms taking an especially hard hit. Most Public Mining Companies Saw Drawdowns Of 90% Or More In 2022 As per the year-end report from Arcane Research, 2022 was a very challenging year for public firms in the crypto sector. The below chart displays the drawdowns in the valuations of some of the big players in the market, as well as that of Bitcoin, during the last twelve months: The deep red performance of the public companies in the digital asset sector &#124; Source: Arcane Research's 2022 - Year in Review As the graph shows, Bitcoin performed terribly this year, seeing negative returns of around 65%, but the large public crypto firms have done worse still. Even Microstrategy, the company whose stocks&#8217; main attraction is exposure to BTC through its large reserves, couldn&#8217;t perform comparably to the asset and observed a deeper year-to-date drawdown of about 74%. The market cap of the popular crypto exchange Coinbase has gone down by 87% this year, which has led to the firm being valued lower than meme coin Dogecoin. The worst performer in the list seems to have been Core Scientific, recording a drawdown of 99%. Core Scientific is one of the biggest Bitcoin mining companies, but due to these large losses, the firm had to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy earlier in the month. Similarly to Core, other BTC miners have also sustained major drawdowns this year, with most of them being 90% or more underwater for the period. But why did the mining firms perform especially poorly? The explanation behind that is multifold.

But three factors meant that this bet from these companies couldn&#8217;t pan out. First, the interest rates kept rising this year. Second, the bear market meant that the price of Bitcoin kept plunging, leading to the value of miners&#8217; rewards also becoming lower. And finally, the third nail in the coffin was the rising energy prices, which resulted in very low or no profits for miners as they have to constantly pay electricity bills to keep their facilities running. All these factors lead to the public miners collapsing under the weight of their short-sighted decisions. Related Reading: Bitcoin Interexchange Flow Pulse About To Reverse, What Does It Mean?
