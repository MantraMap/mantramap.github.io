<ul><li>A New York judge has rejected the ruling regarding XRP by Judge Analisa Torres in SEC v Ripple.&nbsp;</li><li>The decision to reject the Ripple precedent will allow the SEC to pursue the fraud lawsuit against Do Kwon and Terraform Labs.&nbsp;</li><li>Kwon and Terraform Labs previously cited Judge Torres’ ruling in a bid to get the lawsuit filed by the SEC dismissed.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>A federal judge in New York has allowed the Securities and Exchange Commission to pursue its fraud lawsuit against Terraform Labs and its disgraced founder, Do Kwon. However, in allowing the securities regulator to proceed, the judge rejected a previous ruling from fellow Manhattan Judge Analisa Torres, who stated that sales of XRP on secondary markets did not constitute an investment contract.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Rejection Of XRP Ruling Foils Do Kwon’s Attempt To Evade Charges</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-31/ripple-ruling-on-crypto-rejected-by-federal-judge-in-terra-case#xj4y7vzkg" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff rejected the summary judgment from Judge Analisa Torres and paved the way for the SEC to proceed with its legal case against Do Kwon and Terraform Labs.</p>



<p>Do Kwon’s defense team previously cited Judge Torres’ ruling in an attempt to get the SEC’s lawsuit dismissed. The SEC’s charges included the offering of unregistered securities, including UST, LUNA, and MIR. The lawyers urged the court to refer to the summary judgment, which stated that XRP sold in secondary markets did not qualify as a security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kwon’s lawyers argued that Ripple’s partial victory in the legal battle with the SEC demonstrated the regulator’s lack of legal grounds to categorize the majority of cryptocurrencies as securities. The lawyers highlighted the distinction that Judge Torres made between institutional sales and programmatic sales. However, Judge Rakoff refused to acknowledge the said distinction.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The court declines to draw a distinction between these coins based on their manner of sale, such that coins sold directly to institutional investors are considered securities and those sold through secondary market transactions to retail investors are not.”</p><cite>US District Judge Jed Rakoff </cite></blockquote>



<p>The SEC previously informed the court that it intended to <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-appeal-ripple-ruling-xrp-do-kwon/">appeal</a> Judge Torres’ ruling in its lawsuit against Ripple and urged Judge Rakoff to not consider the summary judgment while hearing arguments in the case against Terraform and Do Kwon. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although Base remained in testnet and only opened up to developers in mid-July, traders who sought to book quick profits by apeing in on the meme coin found a way around it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While not having any website or a proper doxxing of the developers behind it, BALD amassed a market capitalization of $50 million a few hours after traders caught a whiff of the first tweet where the token was “mentioned.”</span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h3><b>The market went on a prowl</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As BALD&#8217;s trading volume climbed, its market capitalization surged significantly. It went as high as $50 million on Sunday afternoon, causing a number of traders to log huge gains. For example, Crypto Twitter user @cheatcoiner, who made the first tweet about the token, recorded over $1 million from a $500 investment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Likewise, on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain found that in just four minutes after BALD began trading, four addresses purchased 50 million worth of BALD tokens for 0.534 $ETH . </span><span style="font-weight: 400">This represented 50% of the total supply of the meme coin’s supply. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shortly after, they sold 337 million BALD tokens for $1.04 million, resulting in a remarkable profit of $1 million within a single day with a $1,000 initial investment.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the token’s popularity grew, its market capitalization touched $85 million late Sunday evening, and its value grew by 4,000,000%. </span></p>
<h4><b>All&#8217;s well that ends well</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As BALD trading intensified on Sunday, the project’s developers consistently added Ether tokens to the BALD/WETH liquidity pool. This enabled smooth trading between BALD and the leading alt ETH, and by Monday, the trading pair accumulated more than $32 million in liquidity and recorded a trading volume exceeding $100 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, by mid-day on Monday, data from <a href="https://basescan.org/tx/0xd4fce790ac42a5a801bebb220adc2a6f9d9bf99985de6a824638a269c3e52ade" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Basescan</a> revealed that BALD&#8217;s developers removed $12 million worth of wrapped Ether [WETH] from BALD’s liquidity pool</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> causing BALD’s price to plummet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At press time, the token exchanged hands at $0.002492 dropping by over 90%. Also, the available liquidity on the BALD/WETH liquidity pool stood at $38,000, data from </span><a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0xe96df8f5ef1a8790415068c798765b07d57643bd" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><span style="font-weight: 400">DexScreener</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> revealed. Likewise, the market capitalization that almost touched $100 million was below $3 million at the time of writing. </span></p>

<h4><b>Do you want to bridge to the Base network?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While Base’s mainnet release date remains unknown, learning how to move funds to the network to trade on the decentralized exchanges currently housed within it might be imperative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To do this, you must first set up a <a href="https://metamask.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MetaMask</a> wallet and have some ETH. If you don&#8217;t have MetaMask, you can install it as a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">browser extension</a> or mobile app and then add your ETH to the wallet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once you have your MetaMask wallet set up and funded with ETH, you need to add Base Mainnet to your list of networks in MetaMask. To do this, go to the network selection dropdown in MetaMask and choose &#8220;Custom RPC.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fill in the fields provided with the network details </span><a href="https://docs.base.org/using-base/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><span style="font-weight: 400">provided</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by Base. When this is done correctly, Base Mainnet will appear as one of the networks in your MetaMask. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After successfully adding Base Mainnet to your MetaMask wallet, you can proceed with the bridging process. Decide on the amount of ETH you want to bridge to the Base Mainnet network and ensure you have that amount available in your MetaMask wallet. Once confirmed, initiate the transaction to send the chosen amount of ETH to the designated wallet address provided by Base Mainnet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Remember that you can only bridge funds to the Base Mainnet network now, and bridging back remains officially impossible.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/hong-kong-accountant-duped-tether/">Tether</a> Holdings published its attestation for the second quarter of 2023 earlier today. The report showed that the USDT issuer recorded a profit of more than $1 billion between April 2023 and June 2023, marking a quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) increase of 30%. The attestation was carried out by public accounting firm BDO Italia, which also compiled the stablecoin giant’s Consolidated Reserves Report. </p>



<h2><strong>Tether’s Excess Reserves Topped $3.3 Billion In Q2 ‘2023</strong></h2>



<p>Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino took to <a href="https://twitter.com/paoloardoino/status/1685993811774738432" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a> earlier today to share the latest attestation report. As per the report, the majority of the stablecoin firm’s operational profit came from interest on the T-bills it held in the reserves that backed its USDT stablecoin. The USDT issuer’s overall exposure to U.S. T-bills was $72.5 billion as of June 30, 2023. </p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If Tether was a country, with $72.5 Billion overall t-bill exposure it would be the 22nd largest holder of US treasuries, larger than the UAE, Australia and Mexico and just below Germany, Bermuda and Netherlands.<br><br>Excess reserves also reach $3.3 Billion.

</div></figure>



<p>The stablecoin giant also revealed an excess in its reserve amounting to $850 million, which brought its total excess reserves to roughly $3.3 billion at the end of the second quarter. According to the USDT issuer, the excess acted as a counterbalance and ensured more protection for users. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>While these excess reserves are part of Tether&#8217;s own shareholder equity and normally a company would distribute them as dividends, Tether prefers to keep a big portion of these profits on top of the reserves to make its stablecoins products even more resilient.”</p><cite>Paolo Ardoino, Chief Technology Officer at Tether Holdings Limited</cite></blockquote>



<p>As per the <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/vyse88cgwfbl/63oJePOHqIvrcnXWMPZ1M0/4cfaf2e7cdf80c30b17fdc70faaf741f/ESO.03.01_Std_ISAE_3000R_Opinion_30-06-2023_BDO_Tether_CRR.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">Consolidated Reserves Report</a>, Tether’s total assets amounted to $86.4 billion as of June 30, 2023. In addition to the revenue, the USDT issuer also disclosed a share buyback of $115 million that was made to consolidate the shareholder group. The profits earned in the second quarter were also used to finance other energy related-ventures. </p>

<p>What goes up must come down &#8211; the laws of gravity and memecoins. </p>



<p>BALD, a memecoin on Coinbase&#8217;s L2 network Base, fell sharply in price on Monday after developers pulled 6,800 ETH from the coin&#8217;s liquidity pool. </p>



<p>Data from <a href="https://basescan.org/tx/0xd4fce790ac42a5a801bebb220adc2a6f9d9bf99985de6a824638a269c3e52ade" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://basescan.org/tx/0xd4fce790ac42a5a801bebb220adc2a6f9d9bf99985de6a824638a269c3e52ade" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Basescan</a> showed that developers withdrew $12 million worth of wrapped Ether from BALD&#8217;s liquidity pool on decentralized exchange LeetSwap. The action resulted in a liquidity crunch that tanked BALD&#8217;s price from 9 cents to 1 cent before rebounding back around 2 cents at press time. </p>



<p>The sudden price fall means an over 60% decline in token price during Monday trading hours, per <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bald" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bald" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Coingecko</a>. </p>

<h2>BALD Traders Touch The Moon</h2>



<p>Degen traders made staggering gains on BALD over the weekend after the token leaped from a $50,000 market cap to over $85 million on Sunday evening. The coin boasts above $121 million in trading volume for the past 24 hours.</p>



<p>One trader @cheatcoiner&nbsp;saw their $500 investment rise to nearly $2 million in days as degen traders made speculative plays on the Base ecosystem.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the product’ release, Chainlink noted that the web3 ecosystem has expanded to include multiple blockchains at the layer-1 and layer-2 scaling levels.&nbsp;However, these networks currently function independently and encounter challenges when interacting with conventional systems and other blockchains. The CCIP was introduced to address this issue by serving as a bridge, enabling seamless asset transfers and information sharing between different blockchains.</span></p>
<h3><b>Traders filling up their LINK bags</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While LINK traded under $8 at $7.87 at press time, accumulation continued amongst day traders. On a daily chart, momentum indicators remained in uptrends above their respective neutral lines.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For example, LINK’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) rested at 61.15. Likewise, its Money Flow Index (MFI) was spotted at 68.65. These indicators are commonly used to analyze price trends and identify an asset&#8217;s potential overbought or oversold conditions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Further, above the zero center line at press time, LINK’s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicated the consistent inflow of liquidity into the market. Typically, A CMF value above the zero line is a sign of strength in the market, as buying pressure exceeds selling pressure.</span></p>

<p>DeFi platform Curve Finance <a href="https://twitter.com/CurveFinance/status/1685925429041917952?s=20" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/CurveFinance/status/1685925429041917952?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">warned</a> of a potential exploit on Arbitrum’s tricrypto liquidity pool following last weekend&#8217;s multi-billion hack due to issues with the Vyper smart contract language. </p>



<p>While developers could not identify a profitable exploit on this Arbitrum LP, Curve&#8217;s team advised users to withdraw to avoid possible losses. </p>



<p>The decentralized exchange also confirmed successful attacks on four LP denominated in Ether pairs &#8211; CRV/ETH, alETH/ETH, msETH/ETH, and pETH/ETH. </p>



<h2>$52 Million Hack On Curve Finance Pools</h2>



<p>Curve <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/curve-finance-exploits-46-million-crv-18/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/curve-finance-exploits-46-million-crv-18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suffered</a> exploits on factory pools provided by decentralized finance protocols Alchemix, Metronome, and JPEGd due to a malfunctioning reentrancy vulnerability in Vyper, a compiler programming language. </p>



<p>According to one Vyper contributor, the hacker exploited an obscure attack vector. &#8220;they dug *deep* in our release history to find an exploitable issue for a large protocol with many millions at stake&#8221; said <a href="https://twitter.com/fubuloubu/status/1685856283448979457?s=20" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/fubuloubu/status/1685856283448979457?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@fubuloubu</a> on Twitter. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>I think it&#8217;s on the order of weeks to months to find. The execution was fairly coordinated, perhaps by a small group or team. We might find more information soon, but I think it&#8217;s reasonable to suspect that state-sponsored hackers could be involved, due to the resources invested</p></blockquote>



<p>Over the weekend, exploiters and ethical hackers battled for Ethereum block space as Curve Finance experience outflows in the millions. One attacker lost their loot to an MEV bot operator seeking to safeguard Curve funds amid the incident. </p>



<p>The MEV bot operator identified by their ENS tag &#8220;c0ffeebabe.eth&#8221; returned 2,879 ETH worth $5.4 million to Curve&#8217;s deployer contract, per security outpost PeckShield. </p>

<ul><li>Dubai’s virtual assets regulator has granted an operational MVP license to Binance.&nbsp;</li><li>The crypto exchange can now offer crypto exchange and broker-dealer services to institutional and qualified retail investors.&nbsp;</li><li>The crypto giant expects the UAE to emerge as a standard setter for the global crypto industry.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Binance FZE, the Dubai-based subsidiary of the world’s largest crypto exchange, has received an operational MVP license from Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA). The operational minimum viable product (MVP) license will allow the crypto exchange to offer crypto services, including exchange and broker-dealer services in Dubai.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Binance: UAE To Emerge As Global Standard Setter In Crypto</strong></h2>



<p>Binance FZE has become the world’s first crypto exchange to receive an operational MVP license from Dubai’s virtual assets regulator. The license from VARA will enable the crypto giant to operate two licensed activities in Dubai, crypto exchange services and crypto broker-dealer services, the crypto exchange said in a <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/binance-is-the-first-virtual-asset-exchange-to-receive-an-operational-mvp-license-in-dubai-7342057061995039467" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a>. </p>



<p>The crypto giant’s Dubai-based subsidiary can now offer exchange and broker-dealer services to institutional and qualified retail investors in the region. The authorized services for qualified investors also include the conversion of virtual assets to fiat as per standards laid out by VARA.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>With this operational MVP license, all users onboarded through this platform can expect access to a trusted and regulated service that prioritizes security alongside compliance with highly specialized, tier-one virtual asset regulations under VARA.” </p><cite>Alexander Chehade, Binance Dubai’s General Manager</cite></blockquote>



<p>Binance described the latest development as indicative of its commitment to regulatory compliance in collaboration with local regulators. Richard Teng, the exchange’s Head of Regional Markets, indicated that the exchange’s operations in Dubai would set the stage for global expansion.

<ul><li>The SEC reportedly asked Coinbase to halt trading in all cryptocurrencies except for Bitcoin.&nbsp;</li><li>The regulator’s recommendation came before it sued the crypto exchange last month.&nbsp;</li><li>CEO Brian Armstrong revealed that he declined the SEC’s directive in the interest of the country’s crypto industry.</li><li>The SEC stated that its enforcement team never made any formal requests to companies to delist crypto tokens.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reportedly asked the country’s largest crypto exchange to delist every cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin from its trading platform. The securities regulator’s recommendation for <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/base-trading-volume-200-million-degens/">Coinbase</a> came before it decided to sue the crypto exchange last month. </p>



<h2><strong>SEC: Never Asked Coinbase To Delist Tokens</strong></h2>



<p>According to Coinbase founder and CEO Brian Armstrong, the SEC recommended the crypto exchange to delist more than 200 crypto tokens from its trading platform. Armstrong told the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1f873dd5-df8f-4cfc-bb21-ef83ed11fb4d" rel="nofollow noopener">Financial Times</a> that the securities regulator’s directive came before it decided to sue the publicly traded exchange for operating as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency. </p>



<p>As per Armstrong, the SEC was of the opinion that every crypto asset other than Bitcoin was a security. The regulator reportedly refused to provide legal clarification for its stance on the crypto tokens offered on the trading platform and asked the exchange to delist every token other than the flagship cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>If Coinbase had agreed, that could have set a precedent that would have left the vast majority of the American crypto businesses operating outside the law unless they registered with the commission.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Brian Armstrong stated that complying with the SEC’s recommendation to delist every cryptocurrency from the exchange was not an option for his company. In the interest of the crypto industry in the United States, he chose the path of litigation to find legal recourse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Responding to the claims made by Coinbase’s CEO, the SEC clarified that its enforcement division did not make any formal requests for crypto companies to delist crypto assets from their platforms. “In the course of an investigation, the staff may share its own view as to what conduct may raise questions for the commission under the securities laws,” the regulator added.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Coinbase’s Layer 2 blockchain Base’s trading volume has exceeded $200 million.&nbsp;</li><li>The layer 2 blockchain has recorded more than half a million transactions over the past 24 hours.&nbsp;</li><li>The sudden surge in network activity can be attributed to new tokens like OPTISM, BASED, and meme tokens like BALD.</li><li>Crypto degens have made more than 1000x returns by bridging to Base and blindly buying new tokens.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Base, the layer-2 blockchain developed by <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-vip-access-gets-283-applicants/">Coinbase</a>, reached a major milestone earlier today following a significant rise in activity and trading volume. The sudden uptick in network activity was attributed to the emergence of several new tokens and crypto degens aping them, meaning investing in a new token without proper knowledge and research.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Base Records Over Half A Million Transactions In 24 Hours</strong></h2>



<p>Base has become one of the most talked about topics on crypto Twitter after whale watchers and on-chain analysts highlighted several degen traders who make over a thousandfold profit by bridging to the layer 2 blockchain over the past 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although the bridge launch is scheduled for August 9, 2023, opportunistic crypto traders bridged to the network and started buying newly launched tokens like BALD, OPTISM, COIN, and BASED through a decentralized exchange called LeetSwap. LeetSwap witnessed a trading volume of $233 million over the past 24 hours. RocketSwap, another DEX used by the degen traders to ape meme tokens on Base, saw a trading volume of $4.5 million.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Data from <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base" rel="nofollow noopener">DEX Screener</a> showed that Base recorded more than 536,000 transactions over the past 24 hours, thanks to the degen traders trading meme tokens. The traders were able to bridge using a portal poxy contract released by the layer 2 blockchain. As per <a href="https://dune.com/tk-research/base" rel="nofollow noopener">Dune Analytics</a>, users have sent more than 33,000 ETH ($61.9 million) to Base.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The sudden uptick in network activity led to some users facing issues with swapping leading tokens like BALD, leading to rumors of foul play. However, LeetSwap <a href="https://twitter.com/LeetSwap/status/1685711024962289664" rel="nofollow noopener">assured</a> its users that no project was being rugged and that the issues stemmed from a lot of users using the same congested RPC node.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A user who goes by cheatcoiner on Twitter emerged as one of the most profitable traders amid the sudden popularity of memecoins on Base. The trader invested $500 into the BALD token, when it had a market capitalization of under $50,000, and watched his investment grow to a whopping $500,000 in less than 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Multiple stable pools on Curve Finance have been exploited for over $26 million in wETH and CRV.</li><li>The affected stable pools were using Vyper which had a malfunctioning reentrancy lock.&nbsp;</li><li>The exploit was followed by a second attack on the crv/eth pool, which led to an outflow of another $14 million.&nbsp;</li><li>Native token CRV lost more than 19% of its value, reaching a four-week low of $0.61.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Leading DeFi protocol Curve Finance became the target of multiple exploits earlier today where attackers hit three stable pools resulting in an outflow of more than $40 million. The initial attack targeted the factory pools of Alchemix, Metronome, and JPEGd, all of which suffered from a security flaw called a reentrancy vulnerability.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Whitehat Operation Cut Short By Second Curve Finance Exploit </strong></h2>



<p>According to data compiled by blockchain security firm <a href="https://twitter.com/AnciliaInc/status/1685720461693325312" rel="nofollow noopener">Ancilia</a>, the affected stable pools, namely alETH, msETH, and pETH, all utilized a Pythonic Smart Contract Language called Vyper. Versions 0.2.15, 0.2.16, and 0.3.0 of Vyper were reportedly vulnerable to malfunctioning reentrancy locks, which allowed the hacker to repeatedly withdraw funds from the smart contract.</p>



<p>The attacker managed to exploit Alchemix to the tune of $13.6 million, while NFT lending protocol JPEGd lost $11.4 million. $1.6 million were drained from Metronome DAO’s sETH-ETH-f pool. The tokens associated with all three projects witnessed a significant downtrend following the exploits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A white rescue operation was announced soon after reports of the exploits started taking over the crypto community on Twitter. Curve Finance <a href="https://twitter.com/CurveFinance/status/1685696639325933568" rel="nofollow noopener">assured</a> the community that crvUSD contracts and associated pools were not affected by the attacks. The DeFi protocol further directed all affected parties to coordinate with the white hat efforts. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">crv/eth pool drained minutes before a whitehack operation :(<a href="https://t.co/rhALBzkTEi" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/rhALBzkTEi</a></p>&mdash; banteg (@bantg) <a href="https://twitter.com/bantg/status/1685734521981857792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">July 30, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>However before the white hat operation could ensure the safety of the funds, another attack was mounted on the crv/eth pool. Data from <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xb1c33b391c2569b737ec387e731e88589e8ec148#tokentxns" rel="nofollow noopener">Etherscan</a> showed that the attacker drained 7 million Curve DAO Tokens (CRV) and $14 million worth of wrapped Ether (wETH) in the exploit. The wallet used in this exploit was reportedly funded from <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/germany-binance-license-withdraw-czhao/">Binance</a>. The latest exploit brought the total loss to over $46 million. </p>



<p>The barrage of exploits had a significant impact on the tokens of the affected projects. CRV lost more than 19% of its value, reaching a four-week low of $0.61. At the time of writing, the token was trading at $0.63.</p>
