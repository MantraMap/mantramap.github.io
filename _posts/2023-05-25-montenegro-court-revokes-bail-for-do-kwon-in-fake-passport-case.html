<p>A high court in Montenegro overturned a decision to grant bail to disgraced Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon as he faces charges of attempting to travel with falsified passports. </p>
<p>Bloomberg reports a higher court on Wednesday revoked bail previously granted to Do Kwon and a fellow defendant pending trial.</p>
<p>The Basic Court of Montenegro&rsquo;s capital Podgorica accepted a previous application by Kwon&rsquo;s lawyers to give him and fellow accused, Terra executive Han Chang-Joon, supervised bail as they face trial for attempting to travel with falsified documents.</p>
<p>Kwon and Chang-Joon were set to be released on supervised bail with a payment of 400,000 euros each.</p>
Kwon Arrested in Montenegro
<p>The duo were detained at the airport of Montenegro&rsquo;s capital Podgorica March 23 as they tried to board a flight to Dubai with falsified travel documents. Reuters reported Kwon and Joon had doctored Costa Rican passports, a second set of Belgian passports, laptops, and other devices.</p>
<p>According to Reuters, Kwon and Chang-Joon were charged with forging official documents and were ordered to a 30-day pre-trial detention.</p>
<p>Following their arrest, a court deemed both a flight risk and scheduled them for trial on May 11.</p>
US and South Korea Seek Extradition of Do Kwon
<p>Shortly after his arrest, the United States and South Korean authorities announced that they were seeking the extradition of Kwon. Kwon is a South Korean national charged in September with violating the country&rsquo;s Capital Market Act, and a warrant of arrest was issued for him. &nbsp;</p>
<p>US federal prosecutors indicted Kwon with two counts of securities fraud, wire fraud, commodities fraud, and conspiracy.</p>
<p>Following investigations by numerous law enforcement agencies, the International Criminal Police Organisation, or Interpol,&nbsp;issued a red notice&nbsp;for Kwon.</p>
