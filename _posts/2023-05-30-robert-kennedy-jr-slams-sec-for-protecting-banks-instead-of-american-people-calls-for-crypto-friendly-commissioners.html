Kennedy Jr. says he does not want anti-crypto people on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). He also slammed the securities regulator for protecting banks rather than the American people. &#x201C;What they&#x2019;re doing is obscure, it&#x2019;s not transparent, and it&#x2019;s not bringing transparency to our system,&#x201D; said the presidential hopeful.
