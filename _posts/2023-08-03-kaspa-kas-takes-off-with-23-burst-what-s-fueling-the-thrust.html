Kaspa continues to captivate the blockchain sphere with its interesting nature as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based proof-of-work (PoW) platform. Emerging onto the scene precisely when the blockchain realm was searching for an Ethereum (ETH) alternative, Kaspa&#8217;s protocol arrived as a timely solution. This came after Ethereum&#8217;s transition from proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake (PoS) framework the previous year. A DAG-based PoW is a variation of the traditional proof-of-work consensus mechanism used in blockchain systems. In a typical blockchain PoW system, miners compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles in order to add new blocks to the blockchain. This process requires significant computational power and energy consumption. Related Reading: Curve DAO (CRV) Price Recovery Post-Exploit: What Would Be A Realistic Scenario?
