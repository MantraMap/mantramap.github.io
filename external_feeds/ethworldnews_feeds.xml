<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Founding team members also include Co-Founders of troubled exchange CoinFLEX, Mark Lamb, and Sudgu Arumugam.</li><li>The GTX exchange will allow users to trade claims for defunct crypto companies like BlockFi, Celsius, FTX, and Mt.

<p>Three Arrows Capital (3AC) Co-Founders Su Zhu and Kyle Davies are pitching to investors in a bid to raise $25 million in seed funding for a new cryptocurrency exchange dubbed GTX.</p>



<p>According to the pitch proposal, GTX will allow crypto users to tap into a $20 billion crypto claims market featuring beleaguered entities like BlockFi, Celsius, FTX, and Mt.Gox among others. This means that GTX hopes to offer crypto bankruptcy claims trading. The platform also plans to enter the $2 trillion stock securities lending market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>WuBlockchain’s team confirmed the news with Su Zhu, Co-Founder of the defunct crypto hedge fund 3AC, who said “yes, no comment, just busy building it&#8221;. The team also includes CoinFLEX Co-Founders Mark Lamb and Sudhu Arumugam. </p>



<p>Notably, CoinFLEX buckled under contagion from Terra’s crash in 2022. The platform also <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinflex-resumes-crypto-trading-with-limited-withdrawals-of-up-to-10-of-user-funds/">limited</a> withdrawals in July and <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinflex-lays-off-a-significant-portion-of-its-team-to-reduce-costs-by-50-60/">fired</a> a chunk of its team. </p>



<p>Former Head of Institutional Sales at Amber Group Leslie Lamb will serve as GTX’s Chief Marketing Officer, and Kent Dog who previously worked at Alibaba features as Chief Technology Officer for the new venture. </p>

<h2>3AC Founders Back In The Game</h2>



<p>The news about GTX’s pitch to investors comes months after crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital blew up in mid-2022. Co-Founder Su Zhu and Kyle Davies <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/three-arrows-capital-liquidators-jailtime/">disappeared</a> in the aftermath, with reports claiming the pair flew to Dubai.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both Zhu and Davies alleged that their long positions were hunted by Alameda Research. The pair also <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/alameda-collapse-three-arrows-capital/">claimed</a> that Sam Bankman-Fried’s companies played a role in 3AC’s collapse, although the disgraced FTX Founder denied the allegations</p>



<p>Several watchdogs including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) started investigating 3AC and its founders for financial malpractice and defrauding investors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On January 5, 2023, Zhu and Davies were <a href="https://twitter.com/3ACLiq/status/1610999697983815686?s=20&amp;t=njpXmcU2yBkal_sEfuct6w" rel="nofollow noopener">subpoenaed</a> on social network Twitter as their whereabouts remain unknown to the court and liquidators.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Lazarus Group, the notorious hacking outfit based in North Korea, transferred millions of dollars to multiple crypto exchanges over the past weekend. According to an update from popular blockchain investigator&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1614771861266792449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1614771861266792449%7Ctwgr%5Ec94232ec8379cfb68390e5ef897ac15264c670c2%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coindesk.com%2Ftech%2F2023%2F01%2F16%2Fnorth-korean-hacking-group-tied-to-100m-harmony-hack-moves-41000-ether-over-weekend%2F" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ZachXBT</a>, the hacker group moved 41,000 ETH worth more than $63 million from the Harmony bridge hack to three crypto exchanges, namely Binance, Huobi, and OKX.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Lazarus Group’s funds frozen by Binance</strong></h2>



<p>The North Korean hacker group used Railgun before depositing the exploited funds on the crypto exchanges. Railgun is a privacy platform built on Ethereum which is used for anonymity while making crypto transactions. The crypto sleuth revealed a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.chainabuse.com/report/0a2e8e00-00e2-4749-9b00-ceb1c6202d33" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">list</a>&nbsp;of 350 wallet addresses associated with the hackers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Coinbase Director Conor Grogan spotted Ether transfers to the &#8220;FTX Accounts Drainer&#8221; with private notes on how to move the assets undetected.</li><li>The hacker was advised to leverage less popular and more privacy-based crypto mixer protocols.</li><li>The U.S. Justice Department launched an investigation into the matter after nearly $400 million was stolen from Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s bankrupt crypto exchange. </li></ul>



<p>In a bizarre turn of events, the FTX hacker who drained roughly $400 million in digital assets from Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto exchange received tips on how to launder the stolen funds using mixing protocols. </p>



<p>Coinbase Director Conor Grogan noticed Ether (ETH) transfers to the wallet labeled “FTX Account Drainer” on the block explorer Etherscan. The transaction carried a message directing the hacker on how to launder their massive lot. </p>



<p>In the text, the sender suggested using more privacy-focused crypto mixing services rather than popular protocols like ChipMixer. Crypto mixers allow users to obfuscate their transactions when moving assets around and are a common tool used by crypto criminals attempting to launder their illicit wealth. </p>



<p>The sender also offered to share more information with the hacker on suitable crypto mixers, providing their telegram username should the hacker wish to contact them. Director Grogan likened the attempt to a sales cold call. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">People are sending the FTX exploiter trace amounts of ETH along with a message on how to better launder the funds. Presumably they intend to get in touch with the exploiter and negotiate a consulting fee.

</div></figure>



<p>Notably, the sender also registered a peculiar Ethereum Name Service (ENS) address with more instructions for the hacker to consider &#8211; *swap-gray-crypto-for-white-stablecoins-check-input-data-utf8.eth”</p>



<h2>FTX Hack Investigated By Justice Department</h2>



<p>The U.S. Department of Justice <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/u-s-doj-launches-probe-into-372-million-ftx-hack-following-bankruptcy-filing/">launched</a> investigations into a $400 million hack on FTX, as previously reported in later December 2022. Led by the DoJ’s National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team, authorities said the criminal investigation would probe the identity of the hacker or hackers who drained Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and other digital assets from SBF’s crypto exchange shortly after the company declared bankruptcy on November 12.</p>



<p>Disgraced Founder Sam Bankman-Fried denied ties to the hack on several occasions, claiming he did not “stash away millions and billions in crypto” in his latest “Pre-mortem” analysis on <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-premortem/">Substack</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apart from eight criminal charges slammed against Bankman-Fried by U.S. authorities, federal prosecutors are also investigating SBF’s ‘inner circle’ including ex-CTO Gary Wang and former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison. Both Ellison and Wang already <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2022/12/23/caroline-ellison-admits-she-and-bankman-fried-conspired-to-steal-from-ftx-customers-and-mislead-investors-reports-say/" rel="noopener">flipped</a> on Bankman-Fried, pleading guilty to fraud in exchange for plea deals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prosecutors also met with FTX’s former chief engineer Nishad Singh to <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-nishad-singh-deal-sdny-prosecutors/">weigh</a> his information regarding the crypto exchange’s multi-billion crash in 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A new blockchain platform, <a href="https://blog.shibaswap.com/introduction-to-shibarium/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://blog.shibaswap.com/introduction-to-shibarium/" rel="nofollow noopener">Shibarium</a>, is set to launch as a solution for high gas fees on the Ethereum network from the Shiba Inu team. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">🍖 Introduction to Shibarium: Shiba Inu&#39;s Layer 2 Network — Rejoice <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ShibArmy?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">#ShibArmy</a>! Shibarium Beta is about to be launched, and through this article we want to introduce some basic concepts in order to provide clarity to the community.<br><br>Read more: <a href="https://t.co/xWyPaVlQQ4" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/xWyPaVlQQ4</a></p>&mdash; Shib (@Shibtoken) <a href="https://twitter.com/Shibtoken/status/1614754575604400132?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">January 15, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The launch of Shibarium is to solve a common barrier for users looking to make small transactions in their day-to-day lives, with added fees of $50-$100 on top of a fractional $15 purchase, making it impractical and unrealistic for many to use these digital assets in their daily transactions.</p>



<p>Shibarium is a Layer 2 blockchain, meaning that transactions occur &#8220;off-chain&#8221; and are communicated back to the Ethereum blockchain. This allows the Shibarium blockchain to handle the majority of the processing work, which in turn reduces bandwidth and lowers costs and processing time for users.</p>



<p>Beyond the cost and speed benefits, Shibarium&#8217;s development framework provides robust functionality to allow the community to build their vision into the blockchain. Decentralized Applications (dApps) are a critical component of the expansion of Web 3, and their uses are nearly endless. Gaming, social media, education, and supply chains are just a few of the many potential uses for dApps on Shibarium.</p>



<p>The platform also supports Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) with the ability to create chain-specific NFTs. These tokens can be used for a variety of applications such as event tickets, in-game items, art and music, and digital real estate.</p>



<h2>Shibarium and $Bone</h2>



<p>Shibarium, the highly anticipated Layer 2 blockchain platform, has also announced that its native token, $BONE, will be used to pay for gas transactions and reward validators and delegators within the protocol. </p>



<p>Since its launch in July 2021, the main function of $BONE has been linked to governance, but, according to the team, it will now also play a crucial role in the upcoming Shibarium launch.</p>



<p>Validators and Delegators are assigned a percentage of a token called $BONE that are distributed each time a specific time is reached. They will also be given a portion of another token called TREAT. A commission is a fee taken by the validator for the operation and maintenance of the node. Rewards are distributed based on the amount of tokens staked by each of them, after validator commissions. </p>



<p>The total supply of $BONE is 250 million, with 20 million of those tokens reserved to reward validators and delegators in the coming years. The allocation of these tokens was determined through a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) process, which was voted on by the Shiba community.</p>



<p>$BONE can currently be obtained through ShibaSwap and other decentralized and centralized platforms, and its contract address is: </p>



<p>0x9813037ee2218799597d83d4a5b6f3b6778218d9.</p>



<p>As the launch of Shibarium approaches, $BONE is expected to gain more attention and adoption as it will be at the forefront of gas transactions and rewards within the protocol. </p>

<ul><li>Société Générale has minted a loan of $7 million worth of DAI from MakerDAO.&nbsp;</li><li>The investment firm used home loan bonds as collateral to withdraw the stablecoins.&nbsp;</li><li>Société Générale started a vault in the DAO last year after approval from its community.</li></ul>



<p>French investment banking giant Société Générale took a significant step towards blockchain adoption earlier today when it withdrew millions worth of stablecoins from MakerDAO. The investment bank, which boasts over 130,000 employees spread across 62 countries, tapped its MakerDAO wallet to&nbsp;<a href="https://makerburn.com/?continueFlag=22783de146e77a59faa4664ef13ba7a0#/collateral/RWA008-A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">withdraw</a>&nbsp;$7 million worth of DAI. The move is being seen as a significant step to bridge traditional finance (TradFi) with decentralized finance (DeFi).&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>I’m not actually sure why it took them so long to use the vault, except that my experience with these real-world asset things is that everything always takes a long time,”</p><cite>MakerDAO delegate and crypto researcher Mika Honkasalo.&nbsp;</cite></blockquote>



<h2><strong>Home loan bonds used as collateral for the loan from MakerDAO</strong></h2>



<p>This is arguably the biggest direct transaction between a firm from TradFi and a DeFi project. Société Générale reportedly used home loan bonds worth $40 million as collateral to service the $7 million debt from MakerDAO. The loan was drawn from the investment firm’s vault in the decentralized autonomous organization, which was approved by its community late last year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the time the&nbsp;<a href="https://forum.makerdao.com/t/security-tokens-refinancing-mip6-application-for-ofh-tokens/10605" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">proposal</a>&nbsp;was described as the “first experiment at the crossroads between regulated and open source initiatives”. The proposal was passed with an overwhelming majority, with over 83% of the&nbsp;<a href="https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmajCtnG#vote-breakdown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">votes</a>&nbsp;in favor of Société Générale starting a vault in the <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/makerdao-voting-on-500m-investment-plan/">DAO</a>. The vault reportedly has a debt ceiling of $30 million.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interestingly, this is not MakerDAO’s first TradFi venture. In July 2022, it approved a $100 million stablecoin loan vault for&nbsp;<a href="https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmQMDasC#vote-breakdown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Huntingdon Valley Bank</a>. This proposal was also passed with a unanimous vote from the community. Huntingdon Valley Bank’s debt ceiling was set at $100 million, with the provision to extend it to a billion dollars over 12 months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Société Générale’s loan from MakerDAO only goes on to demonstrate the use cases that DeFi has to offer to the firms operating in traditional finance.</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The FTX founder published a pre-mortem report claiming Alameda Research was the victim of a coordinated attack.</li><li>Sam Bankman-Fried said he believes FTX US is solvent and holds over $350 million in net cash to repay customers if the platform was rebooted today.</li><li>U.S. prosecutors charged SBF with fraud and money laundering in the billion-dollar crash of his Bahamas-based crypto exchange. </li></ul>



<p>Disgraced FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried published his personal thoughts on the factors that drove his cryptocurrency exchange and $32 billion empire to ruin in November 2022. In a “pre-mortem” report released on Substack, Bankman-Fried pointed to three reasons why Alameda’s contagion pulled down FTX.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>$100 Billion Balance Sheet, $8 Billion In Leverage, $7 Billion On-Hand Liquidity&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Firstly, SBF said his trading giant Alameda Research boasted a balance sheet with a new value of around $100 billion in 2021. The company formerly led by Caroline Ellison also supposedly had $7 billion in liquid assets and $8 billion in debt from leverage trading. </p>



<p>A CoinDesk article from November 2022 revealed that Alameda’s books were propped up mostly by illiquid assets like FTT, the exchange token created by FTX out of thin air. </p>



<h2>Market Exposure And Coordinated Attack</h2>



<p>SBF added that Alameda’s assets tanked around 80% in value following “board market crashes” involving defunct entities like Celsius and Three Arrows Capital to name a few. Bankman-Fried also blamed Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao for precipitating an attack that made his trading giant insolvent in November.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The fallen crypto tycoon claimed that contagion from Alameda after CZ’s purported attack pushed FTX international to insolvency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Notably, complaints filed by the&nbsp; Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/cftc-alameda-ftx-client-funds-insolvency/">alleged</a> that Alameda was already insolvent by May 2022 and heavily relied on FTX customer deposits to stay afloat.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>SBF Insists FTX US Is Solvent</h2>



<p>Thursday’s report said that it’s “ridiculous that FTX US users haven’t been made whole”, echoing previous claims from Sam Bankman-Fried that FTX US remained solvent despite ties to the Bahamas-based international crypto exchange, </p>



<p>According to SBF, FTX US had more than $350 million in net cash before bankruptcy CEO John Ray III took over on November 13. Bankman-Fried opined that the U.S.-based exchange could repay customers if the platform was rebooted today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried also pledged all of his personal assets to customers, though he did not specify the value of these assets or where they’re held. </p>



<h2>FTX Could Have Raised Liquidity Says Sam Bankman-Fried </h2>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried maintains that FTX was in a position to raise liquidity despite $5 billion in withdrawals and a massive hole in the company’s balance sheet. SBF added that $4 billion in LOIs was raised post-chapter 11 filing on November 12.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>If FTX had been given a few weeks to raise the necessary liquidity, I believe it would have been able to make customers substantially whole. I didn’t realize at the time that Sullivan &amp; Cromwell—via pressure to instate Mr. Ray and file Chapter 11, including for solvent companies like FTX US–would potentially quash those efforts. I still think that, if FTX International were to reboot today, there would be a real possibility of making customers substantially whole. And even without that, there are significant assets available for customers.</p></blockquote>



<p>Between subtle jabs at CEO John Ray III and claims that FTX still holds billions of dollars in assets enough to repay customers, Sam Bankman-Fried also <a href="https://sambf.substack.com/p/ftx-pre-mortem-overview" rel="nofollow noopener">admitted</a> his estimates are largely based on general data prior to his resignation as FTX chief.</p>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried is set to stand trial on eight counts of criminal charges starting October 2023. So far, top FTX lieutenants like Caroline Ellison, Gary Wang, and <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-nishad-singh-deal-sdny-prosecutors/">Nishad Singh</a> met with U.S. prosecutors to discuss plea deals. Ellison and Wang already <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2022/12/23/caroline-ellison-admits-she-and-bankman-fried-conspired-to-steal-from-ftx-customers-and-mislead-investors-reports-say/" rel="noopener">admitted</a> to fraud at FTX and Alameda.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Crypto broker Genesis reportedly owes more than $3 billion to its creditors.&nbsp;</li><li>These liabilities have prompted parent firm DCG to explore selling assets to raise money.&nbsp;</li><li>DCG’s venture portfolio boasts 200 crypto projects including banks and exchanges in 35 countries.&nbsp;</li><li>Genesis’ $900 million debt to Gemini has led to an online spat between the founders of both firms.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The uncovering of $3 billion worth of liabilities has become the latest development in Genesis’ financial woes. The crypto broker reportedly owes more than $3 billion to its creditors, which include crypto exchange Gemini. The broker’s financial predicament has forced parent firm Digital Currency Group (DCG) to look for ways to raise money.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>DCG reportedly exploring asset sales</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.ft.com/content/eb22bfab-ef05-48ce-83de-ebb904a35dca" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Financial Times</a>, the Digital Currency Group is trying to raise funds for its wholly-owned subsidiary Genesis. People familiar with the matter have revealed that the crypto conglomerate is exploring selling assets from its massive venture portfolio in order to raise fresh cash. The portfolio boasts a vast collection of crypto exchanges, banks, media firms, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DCG owns Grayscale Investments, which issues the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). The crypto empire also includes popular media house Coindesk, as well as investments in popular projects including Circle, Dune Analytics, etc. The <a href="https://dcg.co/portfolio/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://dcg.co/portfolio/" rel="nofollow noopener">portfolio</a> is spread over 35 countries and is reportedly worth $500 million. </p>



<p>The Digital Currency Group is now tasked with raising funds for Genesis, whose debts exceed all the estimates that have been reported until now. The parent firm itself owes more than $450 million to Genesis Capital, in addition to a $1.1 billion promissory note that was issued to bail out the latter when crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital collapsed last year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Genesis’ financial woes have brought DCG founder and CEO Barry Silbert into the limelight. Silbert has been criticized for his subsidiary’s non-repayments, most notably by Cameron Winklevoss, the co-founder and President of the crypto exchange Gemini. Both executives have been involved in a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/gemini-barry-silberts-resignation-dcg/" rel="noreferrer noopener">public spat</a>&nbsp;over the $900 million that Genesis owes to Gemini’s customers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The crypto lender&#8217;s office in Bulgaria was raided on suspicions of fraud, money laundering, and tax evasion.</li><li>Local authorities also claimed to have evidence proving that a Nexo user financed terrorism.</li><li>The company said they&#8217;re cooperating with law enforcement and assured users that the uncertain period &#8220;too shall pass&#8221;.</li></ul>



<p>Nexo’s Bulgarian division was raided by local law enforcement on Thursday due to suspicions that the crypto lender facilitated fraud, money laundering, and tax evasion. According to the official report, Bulgarian police are investigating the company’s domestic entity that boasts operational functions including payroll and customer support.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to fraud and tax evasion allegations, local authorities also believe a Nexo user financed terrorism by leveraging the cryptocurrency platform. The statement from Bulgaria’s prosecutor&#8217;s office said over 300 law enforcement agents are part of the investigation to “neutralize the criminal activity” at the giant crypto lender.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Evidence has been collected that a person who used the platform and transferred cryptocurrencies has been officially declared a terrorist financing person. </p></blockquote>



<p>On Thursday, Nexo <a href="https://twitter.com/Nexo/status/1613477472586338305" rel="nofollow noopener">published</a> a Twitter thread to inform users of the company’s cooperation with local authorities. The crypto lender noted that regulators have adopted a “kick first, ask questions later approach” toward digital asset companies in light of recent crashes and crackdowns in the crypto industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding claims of terrorism financing, the lender highlighted that crypto is not suited for illicit purposes and can be tracked across immutable blockchain records.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Crypto is actually terrible for illicit purposes &#8211; using Chainalysis, for example, we know the history of the asset while it is being deposited and have a good understanding of the address to which it is withdrawn. This is more difficult with fiat and requires other techniques.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Nexo Solvency Draws Doubt After Vauld Rejects Buy-Out Deal</h2>



<p>The crypto lender moved to acquire troubled crypto lender and rival entity Vauld. Vauld shut down withdrawal amid contagion from Terra’s crash after users pulled roughly $200 million from the platform. The crypto lender also staff count by 30% to redirect resources towards restructuring. </p>



<p>On December 26, 2022, Nexo <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/05/crypto-lender-nexo-offers-to-buy-embattled-rival-vauld.html" rel="noopener">submitted</a> a final proposal to take over Vauld. However, Vauld’s creditors rejected the offer, claiming a lack of comprehensive due diligence and solvency assessment report. Concerns about Nexo’s financial health supposedly erupted following Vauld’s rejection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The crypto lender currently under investigation by Bulgarian police also <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/breaking-nexo-is-shutting-down-its-u-s-business/">shuttered</a> its U.S. business in December last year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Layer 1 blockchain Avalanche has&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/avalancheavax/status/1613235554711400448?s=20&amp;t=E0UYS2T7yutSfJEYd8oq5w" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced</a>&nbsp;that it has partnered up with cloud computing giant Amazon Web Services to bring scalable blockchain solutions to enterprises and governments around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>AWS now supports Avalanche’s dApp ecosystem and infrastructure</strong></h2>



<p>According to an&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/avalancheavax/ava-labs-and-aws-bring-scalable-blockchain-solutions-to-enterprises-and-governments-295040a34263" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">update</a>&nbsp;from Avalanche, Amazon Web Services now fully supports the blockchain’s infrastructure and decentralized applications ecosystem. This includes one-click node deployment through the AWS Marketplace, and AWS GovCloud for FedRAMP compliance use cases which is a prerequisite for enterprises and governments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thanks to the partnership, developers will be able to use AWS to deploy scalable, fault-tolerant, and compliant offerings, all while efficiently reducing compliance expenses.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>It has been a huge boon for both individual and enterprise developers to be able to spin up nodes and test networks on the fly with AWS in whatever legal jurisdiction makes the most sense for them” </p><cite>Emin Gün Sirer, Founder and CEO of Ava Labs.</cite></blockquote>

<p>The partnership also makes Ava Labs a member of the AWS Partner Network (APN), which paves the way for customers to deploy custom offerings on AWS. Ava Labs has indicated that it may add&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/avalanche-290m-incentive-program-to-boost-subnets/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Subnet</a>&nbsp;deployment as a managed service to the AWS Marketplace to help both firms launch custom Subnets. This will include a feature to distribute validators securing the Subnet across different regions and availability zones to improve robustness.</p>



<p>As for the developers, the partnership will bring more flexibility, in addition to the added strength of the network. AWS and Ava Labs are also collaborating on events for developers and entrepreneurs to make building on Avalanche easier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Avalanche&#8217;s native token&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/avalanche/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">$AVAX</a>&nbsp;has gained more than 15% since the news came out. The token is currently trading at $14.22. Traders have scrambled to buy the token, resulting in a 16% increase in its trading volume over the past three hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Landis Rath &amp; Cobb lawyers stated the recovery claim during a bankruptcy hearing on Wednesday</li><li>The $5 billion in question was reclaimed in &#8220;cash, liquid crypto, and liquid investment securities&#8221;, per the court hearing.</li><li>FTX bankruptcy CEO John Ray previously tagged the company&#8217;s recovery efforts at around $1.2 billion in December 2022. </li></ul>



<p>Attorneys from Landis Rath and Cobb told a judge that FTX recovered some $5 billion as bankruptcy hearings for the defunct crypto exchange continued on Wednesday. According to Landis Rath and Cobb lawyer Adam Landis, the company reclaimed the stated value in cash, liquid cryptocurrencies, and liquid investment securities. </p>



<p>FTX’s legal representatives noted that the latest recovery did not include approximately $425 million in customer crypto <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/3-5-billion-ftx-customer-crypto-bahamas/">seized</a> by Bahamian authorities in late December 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indeed, Wednesday’s court claim boosted the company’s recovered assets value by a considerable margin. On December 20, 2022, bankruptcy CEO John Ray III said the sunken crypto exchange had secured roughly $1.2 billion in value. Ray noted that loose accounting structures in Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire made it tricky to track down assets.</p>



<p>The latest clawback by the bankruptcy management under Ray could propel the estate’s holdings to over $7 billion, making more funds available for customers, creditors, and investors.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Crypto Twitter Puzzled By Mystery $5 Billion Recovery&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Observers on Crypto Twitter were skeptical regarding claims of a massive $5 billion <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/11/ftx-has-recovered-5-billion-worth-of-liquid-assets-lawyers-say-bankman-fried-crypto.html" rel="noopener">recovery</a> by FTX’s bankruptcy team. Coinbase director Conor Grogan pointed out that on-chain wallets controlled by the defunct exchange held less than $4 billion in value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Users also enquired whether or not the $5 billion in question included over $400 million in Robinhood shares seized by the Department of Justice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Crypto proponent Adam Cochran also speculated that Sam Bankman-Fried himself could be involved in the mystery recovery. The user noted that SBF supposedly offered Elon Musk $5 billion in equity to support his Twitter takeover.&nbsp;</p>

</div></figure>



<h2>FTX Asks Judge To Ignore Celsius Precedent</h2>



<p>FTX attorneys filed a motion to redact all creditor information and protect customer privacy.. The request was opposed by media organizations including Bloomberg, the Financial Times, and the New York Times who argued in favor of the precedent set by Celsius.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Notably, Celsius’s bankruptcy proceedings <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/celsius-users-doxxed-bankruptcy-filing/">revealed</a> 14,000 pages of user information including account names and transaction histories.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lawyers representing the fallen crypto exchange suggested sealing customer data for a period of six months. FTX attorneys argued that this time will be sufficient for the court to assess the value of the data and whether it should be made public.&nbsp;</p>
