<p class="s5">The presale round of Tradecurve (TCRV) has taken the crypto world by storm with its eye-popping growth projection. Meanwhile, Stellar (XLM) and TRON (TRX) have struggled to stop their investors from agitating. Tradecurve has become an instant hit after entering the market. It has raised around $180k during its presale so far.</p>

Stellar (XLM) Settles With Mediocre Gains
<p class="s5">Stellar (XLM) has been one of the best performers in 2023. But the recent weeks have been mediocre for Stellar. The market value of Stellar (XLM) tokens has dropped by 12% in the past week. However, Stellar has risen by 2% on the monthly chart. However, the current trading price of Stellar is 90% down from its peak of $0.94.</p>
<p class="s5">Experts have cited Stellar&rsquo;s recent partnerships as the main reason behind the increase in the network&rsquo;s price. Stellar recently hit the headlines after Brazil&rsquo;s central bank selected it for the development of its digital currency,</p>
<p class="s5">Digital Real. Besides, Stellar is now connected to Polkadot through the Pendulum parachain, which has added to the bullish momentum of XLM. Currently, Stellar is trading at $0.0943.</p>

TRON&rsquo;s (TRX) Development Activity Plunges
<p class="s5">Analysts have been closely observing the price trajectory of TRX since the US SEC filed a lawsuit against TRON founder, Justin Sun. Notably, TRON (TRX) lost 6% of its market value in March. Hence, any event having ramifications on TRON is of significance for investors, who will then decide to stay with the network.</p>
<p class="s5">Besides a lawsuit against its founder, TRON has also suffered from a 36% plunge in the development activity on the network. These bearish events forced TRON to unveil its new staking mechanism called Stake 2.0.</p>
<p class="s5">However, TRON has faced criticism after unveiling the new staking mechanism, as some of its community members have raised questions about the preparedness of the network for this update. A TRON token is currently available to purchase at $0.0653.</p>
