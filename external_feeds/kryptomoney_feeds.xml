<li>Stellar (XLM) is down 1.46% at $0.076 at the time of publication</li>
<li>Stellar-based aid disbursement solution launches for war-affected individuals in Ukraine</li>
<li>The pilot phase is designed specifically for Ukraine but can be adapted worldwide</li>
</ul>
<p>Just like the rest of the crypto markets, <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/stellar-xlm-bulls-didnt-hear-the-okex-news-this-prediction-surfaced-when-uniswap-jumped-as-btc-xrp-fell/">Stellar (XLM)</a> is down 1.46% at $0.076 at the time of publication. UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, and the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF), the non-profit that supports the growth and development of the Stellar blockchain network, have announced the launch of a pilot first-of-its-kind blockchain payment solution for digital cash distribution to internally displaced persons (IDPs) and other war-affected people in Ukraine. UNHCR, in collaboration with United Nations International Computing Centre (UNICC), the UN’s technology solutions provider, is among the first to pilot the new Stellar-based aid disbursement solution, which ensures the delivery of cash assistance directly into the hands of those being assisted quickly, efficiently, and securely with full value transfer traceability and accountability. The pilot phase of the project is designed specifically for Ukraine but can be adapted worldwide.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $0.1150, $0.0990, $0.0800<br />Support levels: $0.0769, $0.0500 $0.0350</p>
<h4>XLM/USD Daily Chart: Bearish</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1436" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63563 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XLMUSD-Daily-Dec-16-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XLMUSD-Daily-Dec-16-1.png 1436w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XLMUSD-Daily-Dec-16-1-300x144.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XLMUSD-Daily-Dec-16-1-1024x491.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XLMUSD-Daily-Dec-16-1-768x368.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XLMUSD-Daily-Dec-16-1-750x359.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XLMUSD-Daily-Dec-16-1-1140x546.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1436px) 100vw, 1436px" /><br /><span style="color: #999999"><em>XLM/USD Daily Chart</em></span></h6>
<p>The price of<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/xlm-price-analysis-whats-next-for-xlm-price-wirex-expands-usdc-support-to-the-stellar-network/"> XLM/USD</a> made an attempt to climb back up on the prior day but failed, drifting lower to oscillate under the $0.0800 mark. Since the declines, XLM has had a difficult time fending off bearish pressures. The pair has been trading sideways within a predetermined range even though the decline appears to continue under the moving average (MA 50 and 200).<br /><br />It is noteworthy that the daily relative strength index (RSI) has now touched the oversold line without a sign of stalling. It resembles a continuous bearish pressure, which signals that the bulls are out of steam. However, if the pair can return above support near the $0.0800 mark, the bulls may attempt to push higher.</p>
<h4>XLM/USD 4-Hour Chart: Bearish</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1436" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63564 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XLMUSD-4-Hour-Dec-16.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XLMUSD-4-Hour-Dec-16.png 1436w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XLMUSD-4-Hour-Dec-16-300x144.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XLMUSD-4-Hour-Dec-16-1024x491.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XLMUSD-4-Hour-Dec-16-768x368.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XLMUSD-4-Hour-Dec-16-750x359.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XLMUSD-4-Hour-Dec-16-1140x546.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1436px) 100vw, 1436px" /><br /><em><span style="color: #999999">XLM/USD 4-Hour Chart</span></em></h6>
<p>The intraday sentiment is uncharted, and the XLM/USD is still trading in a range below $0.0800. On the other hand, the breakout of the $0.0800 low level might support the idea that the decline from the November high at the $0.1162 level will continue toward the $0.0700 level.<br /><br />Possibly a retest of the $0.0800 level and a break into the $0.0990 confluence region would follow a fresh rebound from the current price in the $0.076 area. On the other hand, a break of the $0.0800 support turned resistance level could initially reverse the downtrend and trigger another round of drops as traders sell during rallies.</p>

<p>Longtime CNBC host Jim Cramer, in his usual criticism of cryptocurrencies, says he is negative on XRP, LTC, and DOGE. &#8220;I think you should be negative on crypto.&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;m negative on XRP, LTC, and DOGE because I haven&#8217;t been able to find anyone that takes them,&#8221; Jim Cramer stated in a recent CNBC Squawk Box edition. He further added, &#8220;It&#8217;s like $80 billion worth of non-Bitcoin that&#8217;s destined to be wiped out.&#8221;<br /><br />The XRP community won&#8217;t let Cramer’s criticism slide. Crypto Law founder John Deaton responded, &#8220;Jim Cramer continues to talk about XRP, and he is totally clueless about the asset itself or the network—the XRPLedger—in which XRP operates.&#8221;<br /><br />Similarly, the CNBC host claims in a Friday tweet that Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, has &#8220;no real legitimacy&#8221; following the collapse of its primary rival FTX. <br /><br />The host of CNBC&#8217;s &#8220;Mad Money&#8221; seemed perplexed by market experts&#8217; refusal to recognize that most cryptocurrencies have no value at all.<br /><br />&#8220;Why aren&#8217;t there strategists saying that most crypto is worthless and should be sold?&#8221; he wonders. Cramer goes on to say that he would rather put his money in DraftKings, a sports betting firm, than Binance. This is not the first time the financial expert has targeted the world&#8217;s largest bitcoin exchange.<br /><br />Jim Cramer is critical of cryptocurrencies, calling them a &#8220;gigantic&#8221; scam. &#8220;The whole thing seems so bottomless that I don&#8217;t know how to fathom it,&#8221; he said. According to Cramer, XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE), and Solana (SOL) are all &#8220;cons.&#8221;<br /><br />Cramer appears to have adopted an often-hard position on cryptocurrency assets, claiming that only blockchain technology is valuable, not cryptocurrency itself. &#8220;No one thinks blockchain is bad,&#8221; the CNBC host said.<br /><br />The CNBC host also reiterated JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon&#8217;s admiration for blockchain while comparing cryptocurrency to &#8220;pet rocks.&#8221; <br /><br />Since 2014, the &#8220;Blockchain, not Bitcoin&#8221; narrative has gained support, with crypto detractors suggesting that the technology has more viable applications beyond speculative trading.</p>
<h2>Binance Announces Give Away of 1 BTC for New Users</h2>
<p>Top crypto exchange Binance Card is launching an exclusive giveaway for its new users. It announces that eligible new Binance Card users&#8217; actions will qualify them to receive a BUSD or BTC coin reward, which is 1 BTC in their Spot wallet.<br /><br />This is if they order their Binance Card during the promotion period and complete a successful transaction or make an ATM withdrawal with their Binance Card during the promotion period from December 1 to December 31, 2022.</p>

<p>Solana-based DEX, <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/raydium-serum-iost-shiba-inu-hedera-lead-altcoin-pack-rebound-is-the-btc-market-setting-up-a-bear-trap/">Raydium</a> has been exploited for over $4.4 million, according to the post-mortem analysis carried out by the team. <br /><br />Arkham Crypto Intelligence gave indications about the exploit, <em>’’It appears that an account on Solana is draining multiple liquidity pools on Raydium. The account has received thousands of Solana in the last few minutes. We would advise withdrawing any liquidity on Raydium until further notice’’,</em> it stated.<br /><br />The exploit was officially confirmed by the Raydium Twitter account,’’ An exploit on Raydium is being investigated that affected liquidity pools. Details to follow as more is known. Its initial knowledge is that the attacker overtook owner authority, but the authority has been halted on AMM and farm programs for now.<br /><br />It gives an Initial Post-Mortem, stating it was working with 3rd-party auditors and teams across Solana to gather additional information. It says that a patch has been deployed to prevent further exploits from the attacker.</p>
<p>Raydium’s upgrade authority is held by a SquadsProtocol multisig so the attack was not related to upgrade authority on the program, it stated. The exploit appears to stem from a trojan attack and compromised private key for the pool owner account, it stated giving the root cause of the incident.</p>
<p>The attacker then accessed the pool owner account and was then able to call the withdrawalPNL function, a function used to collect trading/protocol fees earned by swaps in pools. The hacker was also able to set the parameters to change the settings for both quote and base tokens in the affected pools in order to modify expected fees and then withdraw those amounts.</p>
<p>According to it, the pools affected are SOL-USDC, SOL-USDT, RAY-USDC, RAY-USDT, RAY-SOL, stSOL-USDC, ZBC-USDC, UXP-USDC, whETH-USDC.</p>
<p>The approximate total funds exploited by the attacker are RAY, $1,879,638, stSOL $3,214, whETH $39.3, USDC $1,094,613, SOL $120,512, UXP $21,068,507, ZBC $9,758,647, USDT $110,427. In total, this represents nearly $4,395,237.</p>
<h2>Here Are Bitcoin Predictions for 2023</h2>
<p>While <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/btc-price-analysis-bitcoin-sustains-above-yearly-lows-179250-btc-withdrawn-from-exchanges-since-novembers-start/">Bitcoin</a> may still test a potential low of $10,000-$12,000, it could recover to $30,000 in the second half of 2023, Matthew Sigel, VanEck&#8217;s head of digital assets research predicts. Bitcoin is currently trading down 3.40% at $16,968.</p>
<p>Marion Laboure, a research analyst at Deutsche Bank predicts <em>&#8220;Although investors have suffered significant losses, we believe this second &#8216;crypto winter&#8217; will be a net positive because the FTX collapse will edge the crypto ecosystem closer to the established financial sector.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Tom Norwood, Co-founder and CEO of LOOP markets predicts, <em>&#8220;Demand for bitcoin should continue to grow regardless of market conditions as it is still better than most currencies in that it at least has a good chance of going up eventually, whereas most currencies are just going to depreciate over time.&#8221;</em> Norwood expects the crypto market to pick up in about six months.</p>
<p>In their<em> &#8220;surprise&#8221;</em> scenario for 2023, Standard Chartered on the other hand forecasts Bitcoin dropping to $5,000 if the present decline continues.</p>

<p>Blockchain analytics company <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/dashboard/639937bbfbe454308ff04670">CryptoQuant</a> has confirmed that all of Binance&#8217;s reserves are present and accounted for after receiving a lot of bad press for its most recent proof-of-reserves audit.<br /><br />Over the past few days, FUD reports claiming that this or that cryptocurrency platform is about to shut down have roiled the market for cryptocurrencies. Being the largest trading platform in the industry, Binance has emerged as the primary target of the majority of FUD.<br /><br />Binance&#8217;s overcollateralized Bitcoin reserves were confirmed by the proof-of-reserves report created by Mazars. However, Mazars began to distance itself from the report after it was criticized by some business experts, and as a result, the <a href="https://veritas.mazars.com/binance/">link</a> to it is no longer active.</p>

<h6><em>Source: <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/dashboard/639937bbfbe454308ff04670">CryptoQuant</a></em></h6>
<p>Given that the report used an<em> &#8220;agreed-upon procedure&#8221;</em> rather than a complete audit that followed a process imposed by the auditor, the issue seems to have been that the report was not a proper audit.<br /><br />With 30% of its reserves in BTC, Binance is now the largest exchange in the market, according to CryptoQuant&#8217;s analysis of the exchange. With 26% of its reserves held in Bitcoin, Coinbase came in second.<br /><br />The fact that the liabilities reported by <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/asset/btc/chart/exchange-flows/exchange-reserve?exchange=binance&amp;window=BLOCK&amp;sma=0&amp;ema=0&amp;priceScale=log&amp;metricScale=linear&amp;chartStyle=line">Binance</a> and CryptoQuant&#8217;s estimation were so similar was one of the report&#8217;s main messages.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;In order to assess the data in Binance’s Proof-of-Reserves report, we compared Binance liabilities expressed in the report to CryptoQuant’s on-chain metric Binance BTC Reserve data (our estimate of Binance’s customers’ deposits). We found out that the liabilities reported by Binance are very close to our estimation (99%).&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the report&#8217;s findings, Binance&#8217;s ETH and stablecoin reserves are <em>&#8220;not showing FTX-like behavior,&#8221;</em> and the BNB exchange coin did not make up a significant portion of reserves.<br /><br /><em>&#8220;Binance has an acceptable &#8220;Clean Reserve,” which means its token, BNB, is still a low proportion of its total assets.&#8221;</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The defunct cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-charged-with-eight-criminal-offenses/">FTX</a> yesterday submitted a<a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.deb.188450/gov.uscourts.deb.188450.233.0.pdf"> fresh motion</a> to the Delaware Bankruptcy Court requesting approval of the bidding processes for four of the company&#8217;s independent, solvent subsidiaries.<br /><br />The company is trying to raise money through the sale of its subsidiary businesses to pay its billion-dollar debt to creditors.<br /><br />If the sale of assets is outside the normal course of business, bankrupt businesses need to get the court&#8217;s approval. In the upcoming two months, FTX intends to sell Embed Technologies, LedgerX LLC, FTX Japan, and FTX Europe, according to the filing. The motion has a hearing date of January 11, 2023, and the deadline for objections is December 29, 2022.<br /><br />The company has already received <em>&#8220;dozens of unsolicited bids,&#8221;</em> according to the filing. Nevertheless, the court must give its approval before the bidding can start.<br /><br />The motion directs the company to sell such solvent businesses as soon as practicable. Protracted delays can have a significant impact on their value.<br /><br /><em>&#8220;The licenses held by FTX Europe have been suspended, and FTX Japan is subjected to suspension,&#8221;</em> read the motion. <em>&#8220;The longer operations are suspended, the greater the risk to the value of assets and the risk of permanent revocation of licenses.&#8221;</em><br /><br />Broker-dealers and financial institutions can use the clearing and custody platform run by Embed Technologies. Additionally, it is an SEC-regulated broker-dealer that is registered with FINRA. The deadline for submissions for Embed Technologies is January 18, 2023.<br /><br />The deadline for submission of bids is January 25, 2023, and FTX also intends to sell all of its shares in LedgerX, the CFTC-approved derivatives exchange. Two additional subsidiaries, FTX Japan and FTX Singapore are owned by FTX Japan Holdings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are willing to spend money in the bitcoin crypto, you can pick several ways and start the investing process, but there is one best option and all that is the exchange platform. It is the best platform for all beginners because it is readily available on the internet but finding the right one takes time and effort. One has to check different things in a top exchange platform, and one can use <a href="https://quantum-code.app/">QUANTUM-CODE.APP</a>. One has to check the things like standing, safety, consumer interface, charges and customer support. If you have these things in your exchange platform, there is no need for other options. Then, you are good to go. There are different things in the bitcoin exchange, and all have different natures. You should always find the suitable one and ensure satisfaction from that platform.</p>
<p>If you have the proper exchange, then your research is complete. You must search for the top qualities in that platform and ensure you have all the main things in your forum. There is one more thing when you have the best exchange, and then you will not need to go through several difficulties. If you do better research, you will get a better deal, providing you with a great experience of using in the journey. An excellent exchange platform will always help you to buy or sell <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ftx-plunges-80-as-bitcoin-marks-lowest-point-in-2022-altcoins-post-losses-of-over-30-here-are-recent-happenings/">digital coins</a> safely. `If you want to figure out the best qualities of the exchange platform, then this article is the right guide for you.</p>
<h3>Find a reputed exchange</h3>
<p>Reputation is the primary quality of the exchange, and if your platform is reputed, it means you have solved half of your research. It is a fantastic way to figure out the capability and market standing of the exchange, which is the primary quality, and everyone should watch it. You can check the reputation with simple steps. First, you have to check the old users&#8217; descriptions and reviews.</p>
<p>You can go with that platform if you find it genuine and have a better stand in the market. If you find it better, you should go with it, and you can make a list. After that, you should shorten the list and find the reputed exchange. This way, you will get the best and most reputed exchange platform for starting the journey.</p>
<h3>Go for better security</h3>
<p>In this quality list, another one that you should check is security, and it must be top-notch without any loose ends. You should always check out the safety and, if you find it better, go for that particular exchange platform to start the journey. The main feature you have to check is two-factor authentication; if it is available, you should go for that option only.</p>
<p>If you find another security option with this security, it will be great for you, and you should go with it. It is an excellent option for the beginner because it acts like an alarm and provides information if someone misbehaves with the user account. It helps defend the bill from hackers, which is why it is essential to have this option in the exchange. This function is another quality of the best exchange platform, and one should always keep it in mind.</p>
<h3>Go with customer support</h3>
<p>If you are a user of the exchange platform and your account on that platform is not working correctly, customer support is the key to solving it.

In customer support, the experienced team will help you figure out the solution to your problem. And if you want to contact them about issues, you can use several modes. You can take help by email, message, or call. You will get help from one expert on other lines.</p>
<p>The expert will hear your problem and provide you solution quickly, which is the finest thing.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>According to Coinswitch analysts, Shiba Inu (SHIB) might have three secret moves up its sleeve. This might suggest the presence of catalysts that might propel it higher come 2023.<br /><br />First is its growing address list. Analysts at Coinswitch note that addresses holding SHIB tokens have peaked over the past 30 days, indicating constant accumulation.<br /><br />Second, SHIB has a low MVRV. The term MVRV refers to the ratio of market capitalization to realized capitalization. Simply put, if the realized capitalization is higher than the market capitalization, the price action of an asset can see a surge.<br /><br />The third is increasing whale movements. Large SHIB-specific transactions have started looking up over the past week or so. The surge in whale activity might be a positive thing, as in the case of SHIB, whales hold almost 70% of the token supply.<br /><br />Shiba Inu adoption, which has experienced noticeable growth since 2022, might sustain this in the forthcoming year. Through Binance Pay&#8217;s partnership with leading Bahraini payment provider EazyPay, STC customers can now pay their phone bills with Shiba Inu.<br /><br />STC Bahrain has become the first telecom operator in Bahrain to expand its payment options amid the partnership to meet the growing demand for easy-to-use crypto payments. Also, the collaboration indicates Bahrain’s commitment to advancing the country’s fintech landscape.<br /><br />Likewise, the growing trend of listings might continue. Crypto exchange, Huobi Global sparked speculations about the potential listing of Shiba Inu’s ecosystem token, Bone ShibaSwap (BONE), as it recently posted a tweet containing a picture of a cute Shiba Inu dog wearing a Santa dress with a blurry Christmas tree in the background. The caption reads “Huobi (handshake) Christmas.”</p>
<h2>Helium Migrating to Solana in Q1 Next Year</h2>
<p>Helium is migrating onto the Solana blockchain by Q1 2023, the team revealed in a recent tweet. Helium hotspots will each be represented by an NFT on Solana, creating almost 1 million new Solana NFTs.<br /><br />In September, the Helium core developer team released a proposal (HIP 70) to greatly increase the operating efficiency of the Helium blockchain.<br /><br />To do this, the core developer team suggested shifting data transfer accounting and proof-of-coverage (“PoC”) to Oracles, which streamlines the system architecture and enables the use of a more scalable Layer 1 (“L1”), notably Solana. By utilizing the extensive selection of composable Solana developer tools, features, and applications, such a shift would result in significant economies of scale, as stated by the team.<br /><br />With almost a million hotspots installed worldwide and increased data throughput thanks to an ever-growing number of use cases, the Helium Network has experienced phenomenal growth.<br /><br />During the cryptocurrency run-up of last year, investors who had been mostly focused on Ethereum started diversifying into Solana and other alternative blockchains.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/coinbase-reveals-over-33000000000-worth-of-bitcoin-in-its-reserves/">Coinbase</a>, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States, has launched an asset recovery tool that will allow users to recover over 4000 unsupported ERC-20 tokens that were accidentally sent to the exchange. Non-supported assets will be returned to user addresses in exchange for a small fee.<br /><br />The tool only needs the Ethereum transaction ID of the lost funds and the incorrect Coinbase address where the tokens were sent, according to a <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbase-announces-new-asset-recovery-tool-for-erc-20-tokens">blog post</a> from Coinbase on Thursday. At no point does it reveal any user&#8217;s private keys.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“We did this by using patent-pending technology to send the funds directly from your inbound address without processing the funds through our centralized exchange infrastructure,”</em> said the company.</p>

<p>Only a few ERC-20 tokens, such as wETH, TUSD, and STETH, are eligible for recovery. Each eligible asset must pass the listing review process at Coinbase.<br /><br />The first significant exchange to permit <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/erc-20-tokens-protocol-explained/">ERC-20 token</a> recoveries at scale while upholding the security of its users&#8217; deposit addresses is Coinbase, which claims to be true. According to its website, <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/frequently-asked-questions-on-incorrect-deposits-115003798632">Binance</a> does not provide the same service, but it may offer customized assistance to users who have lost &#8220;significant funds&#8221; as a result of unintentional transfers.</p>

<p>The service is still not available in Japan, nor for Coinbase Prime.</p>

<p>To maintain its cloud services,<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/product/changes/MCA"> Microsoft&#8217;s updated terms</a> restrict access to Bitcoin and crypto mining. Any users who intend to do so now must receive pre-written approval from the company.<br /><br />In an attempt to maintain its cloud services, Microsoft&#8217;s updated terms are restricting access to Bitcoin and crypto mining. Any users who intend to do so now must receive pre-written approval from the company.<br /><br /><em>“We suggest seeking written pre-approval from Microsoft before using Microsoft Online Services for mining cryptocurrencies, regardless of the term of a subscription,”</em> it added. <br /><br />Microsoft has claimed that crypto mining can <em>&#8220;cause disruption or even impairment to online services,&#8221;</em> according to the British tech site <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/12/15/microsoft_online_services_cryptomining_ban/#:~:text=Updated%20Microsoft%20has%20quietly%20banned,into%20effect%20on%20December%201.">The Register</a>. Furthermore, its users are frequently associated with<em> &#8220;cyber fraud&#8221;</em> and <em>&#8220;abuse attacks,&#8221;</em> which involve the unauthorized use of customer resources.<br /><br /><em>&#8220;We made this change to further protect our customers and reduce the risk of disrupting or impairing Microsoft Cloud,&#8221;</em> the company said. One scenario in which it may allow a customer to mine is for testing and research purposes. <br /><br />Google Cloud also prohibited the use of its servers for crypto mining without written permission, whereas Oracle and OVH outright prohibited it. Amazon Web Services (AWS), on the other hand, only allows crypto mining within its paid tiers.<br /><br /><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/binance-announces-500-million-fund-to-lend-to-bitcoin-miners/">Miners</a> have been struggling to stay afloat in recent months due to Bitcoin&#8217;s increasing difficulty adjustment and collapsing price. North Computer has already declared bankruptcy, and companies such as Iris Energy and Argo Blockchain have stated that they will be unable to make their interest payments.<br /><br />Core Scientific was in a similar situation in October, but has since agreed to restructure its debt with B.Riley, receiving a $72 million loan from the company.<br /><br />Many private companies have taken issue with crypto mining over its energy footprint, prompting them to disassociate from the industry. Mozilla, for example, stopped accepting donations from Proof of Work-based cryptos in January.</p>

<p>Market observers expect the cryptocurrency market to pick up in 2023 after a brutal year that saw bitcoin sink around 75% from its all-time high in November last year. Bitcoin appears to be preparing for this major move, as Santiment, an Onchain analytics firm, has noticed an interesting trend in Bitcoin whale accumulation.<br /><br />Santiment observed that Bitcoin&#8217;s whales have been reducing their supply held and dumping in profit-taking after the 2020 to 2021 bull run for approximately 14 months. Prices have been falling in tandem with these dump-offs.<br /><br />However, there has been a recent improvement. Not necessarily in terms of prices, but at least in terms of whales finally accumulating rather than dumping. Santiment observes that the largest streak of new BTC whale addresses has been created in 10 months.<br /><br />159 new addresses holding between 100 and 10,000 bitcoins have been created in just three weeks. This is the fastest growth of these addresses in 10 months, Santiment observes. The number of BTC whale addresses holding 100 to 10,000 BTC is now 15,848.<br /><br />But additionally, 40,747 more bitcoins worth $726 million have collectively entered key whale wallets in just the past 9 days.<br /><br />Also, Tether&#8217;s key addresses have collectively accumulated $817.5 million more in buying power in just the past three days, a 7% increase from what they were holding before the start of the week. Binance USD&#8217;s key addresses have also collectively accumulated $104.9 million more in buying power in the same timeframe. This represents a 9% increase.</p>
<h2>J.P.Morgan predicts big catalyst for ETH price</h2>
<p>The Ethereum merge occurred in mid-September and ushered in a transition to a proof-of-stake mechanism for the second-largest cryptocurrency. JP Morgan&#8217;s analysts believe this and an upcoming upgrade might be a catalyst for Ethereum&#8217;s price.<br /><br />&#8220;We believe that the Ethereum Merge and really the Ethereum Surge could be a big factor in terms of increasing the use-cases for blockchain into new areas, including financial services,&#8221; JP Morgan analysts wrote in an early December note.<br /><br />The Surge, an upcoming upgrade, might reduce costs, make the ETH network safer, and process transactions faster.<br /><br />&#8220;We continue to see the Ethereum Surge as a catalyst for development in the cryptocurrency markets, which appears at least 6-12 months away.&#8221;</p>
