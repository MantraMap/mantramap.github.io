<p>Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) are two of the biggest losers in crypto markets right now. Both are dropping by double digits in a matter of days. However, Tradecurve (TCRV) is one of the few coins bucking the trend. They are also setting new highs during a presale event. Let's jump into why these three coins are behaving so differently in the market.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>
Tradecurve (TCRV): Surging to New Highs Amidst Market Turmoil
<p>Tradecurve (TCRV) is a groundbreaking trading platform that successfully combines the best features of both centralized and decentralized exchanges. Here, users can conveniently trade an array of assets &mdash; such as cryptocurrencies, stocks, forex, and commodities &mdash; all within a single account.</p>

<p>TCRV is the proprietary token of the Tradecurve platform. Owners of this cryptocurrency gain access to multiple benefits, including reduced fees, earning passive income through liquidity provision, and discounted fees on AI tools.</p>
<p>Presently, TCRV can be bought at a discounted price of $0.025 during the fourth stage of the platform's presale. Analysts recognize that Tradecurve brings an innovative product to a trillion-dollar industry, and it's no surprise that investors are rushing to get their hands on TCRV before the presale ends.</p>
Litecoin (LTC): Analyzing the Factors Behind its Recent Dumping
<p>Litecoin (LTC), launched in 2011, is one of the earliest and most recognized cryptocurrencies, often referred to as the "light" version of Bitcoin. It has a proven track record, with its value exceeding $400 twice, in 2017 and 2021.</p>
<p>Litecoin has had a strong Q2 2023, with prices recently pumping from $69 to over $114 in just two weeks. This Litecoin price surge was triggered by the upcoming halving event that traditionally causes a surge in demand and higher prices.</p>
<p>However, despite its excellent performance over Q2 2023, Litecoin has recently experienced some selling pressure and fallen back below the $100 support/resistance zone. Litecoin traders were perplexed by this as it was not in line with previous trends.</p>
<p>It seems that the market impact of Litecoin has not been as strongly felt around the world. It was not felt as it had been in previous years. Analysts are commentating that the bullish narrative around this event is now over. Also, Litecoin holders may be looking to move their funds into alternatives. This is with the Litecoin halving less than one month away,</p>
Bitcoin Cash (BCH): Understanding the Reasons for its Price Decline
<p>Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is another popular cryptocurrency and was created as a hard fork of Bitcoin in 2017. It has had some impressive performance over Q2 2023, recently pumping by over 200% from $104 to $328 in just 10 days.</p>
<p>This Bitcoin Cash pump seemed to come from nowhere. This is as Bitcoin Cash has been moving within a tight range since early 2022. Analysts note that Bitcoin Cash broke out of Descending Triangle pattern. This happened on the daily chart and this created a strong buying signal.</p>
<p>But the real bullish trigger for Bitcoin Cash was the listing of Bitcoin Cash EDX Markets &mdash; a new crypto exchange backed by Wall Street. However, Bitcoin Cash has recently fallen back below its $300 support/resistance zone and is currently trading at just $273.</p>
<p>Traders are still cautious about holding Bitcoin Cash in the long term given its volatile history. So it is likely that some holders are taking their profits and shifting to more reliable options, like Tradecurve.</p>
