<p class="s3">Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Axie Infinity were among the top cryptocurrencies making headlines in 2020/21. Quite logical, given that Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Axie Infinity (AXS) were among the best performers at the time, doing thousands of percentages in gains.</p>
<p class="s3">But will Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Axie Infinity (AXS) repeat the magic of 2021? Analysts believe that the best days of these two high-profile cryptocurrencies are over. </p>
<p class="s3">Instead, analysts believe new cryptocurrencies that still have a tiny market cap will explode next. One cryptocurrency that analysts are particularly bullish on is Sparklo (SPRK), which is still in the presale stage. </p>
<p class="s3">With the attention that Sparklo (SPRK) is getting from investors, it could easily make it to the top 100 cryptos by market cap. </p>
<p class="s7">Shiba Inu (SHIB) Best Days Behind It</p>
<p class="s3">Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a perfect example that timing matters when investing. Those who got into Shiba Inu (SHIB) in 2020 or early 2021 made good money. Some early Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors became millionaires from investments as low as $500. </p>
<p class="s3">However, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) of today is far from that of 2020. Today, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a large-cap cryptocurrency. Expecting Shiba Inu (SHIB) to give another 1 million percent in gains would be expecting a bigger market cap than Bitcoin. That&rsquo;s simply unrealistic for Shiba Inu(SHIB).</p>
<p class="s3">Analysts also believe that even a few thousand percent gains for Shiba Inu (SHIB) may be unrealistic. That&rsquo;s because, unlike in 2020, hundreds of Shiba Inu (SHIB) competitors are coming to the market today. Since many have lower market caps, they stand to gain more than Shiba Inu (SHIB) in another crypto bull rally.</p>
<p class="s3">While Shiba Inu (SHIB) is now in the past, analysts believe Sparklo (SPRK) has the potential to repeat what Shiba Inu (SHIB). Sparklo (SPRK) has the hype, and it's still a low-cap crypto, just like SHIB in 2020.</p>
<p class="s7">Axie Infinity (AXS) Best Days Are Behind It</p>
<p class="s3">Analysts increasingly agree that Axie Infinity (AXS) has seen better days. Firstly, all the hype around P2E gaming that propelled Axie Infinity (AXS) to the limelight is long gone.</p>
<p class="s3">Most gamers have realized that the quality of games and rewards on Axie Infinity (AXS) and most P2E platforms does not match what you get in conventional gaming environments.</p>
<p class="s3">At the same time, even within the P2E gaming world, Axie Infinity (AXS) has lost its edge to newer cryptocurrencies with more games. </p>
<p class="s3">This is compounded by the fact that Axie Infinity (AXS) today has a large market cap. This means that even if the broader market rises again, Axie Infinity (AXS) will likely do something 3X.</p>
<p class="s3">That&rsquo;s pretty small compared to Sparklo (SPRK), which analysts predict could do 100X or more.</p>
<p class="s7">Sparklo All Set To Rally As Investors Seek 100X-Plus Gains</p>
<p class="s3">Sparklo (SPRK) is getting much attention from investors seeking 100X or more gains. Can Sparklo (SPRK) deliver that? Analysts believe it can do so because it is still low-cap crypto, so there is room for growth. </p>
<p class="s3">Sparklo (SPRK) is still in the presale stage and currently going for only $0.015. This is a pretty affordable price for all levels of investors and could drive FOMO around Sparklo (SPRK).</p>
<p class="s3">At the same time, investors are attracted to Sparklo (SPRK) for its high transparency. With Sparklo (SPRK), investors buy crypto whose smart contract is fully audited by InterFi Network. Sparklo (SPRK) also has a KYC audit to ensure everything is above board. </p>
