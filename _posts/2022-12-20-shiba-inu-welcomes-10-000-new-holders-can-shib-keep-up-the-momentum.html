Despite the market downturn, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is still seeing growth in terms of its holder base. The meme coin maintains its position as one of the most popular cryptocurrencies as its total holder count has now crossed 1.26 million. 10,000 New Shiba Inu Holders Added In a time when cryptocurrencies across the space are marking a decline in support, Shiba Inu has added over 10,000 new holders in the span of two weeks. This saw the total SHIB holders cross into the 1.26 million territory, marking more growth for the meme coin. In the last 24 hours alone, the number is up by 0.033%, according to data from Etherscan.

The growth comes even as the price of the digital asset suffers multiple setbacks, drastically dragging down the profit margins for investors. Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world by trading volume, recently released the data for the most-watched cryptocurrencies on the platform, and Shiba Inu emerged in the top three; alongside market leaders Bitcoin and Ethereum. SHIB price struggles at $0.000008 &#124; Source: SHIBUSD on TradingView.com Will SHIB Price Remain Stagnant? SHIB’s price has been quite unresponsive to all of the new milestones being hit. The holder base had been consistently climbing over the last two months but the price of SHIB has not reacted positively in any way. Instead, developments on Shiba Inu seem to be disconnected from the price performance of the native token.

It continues to trend just above $0.000008 as the bear market rages on. It is important to keep in mind that the total number of active Shiba Inu addresses currently sits below 5% of its total addresses. This means that there is a decreased activity for the digital asset, which could explain why there have been no positive reactions to the milestones.  The cryptocurrency has also fallen out of favor with large Ethereum whales who no longer hold a significant amount of the cryptocurrency on their balances. This has accelerated the bear case for the meme coin. If momentum does not pick up, then it is possible that SHIB could see the lower side of $0.000007 before the year is over.  Featured image from Crypto News, chart from TradingView.com
