What Is Behind The Chiliz (CHZ) Rally? CHZ acts as a fan token and has always been a community-driven project that relies on voting power from members. The Chiliz project has many lucrative partnerships with soccer giants such as Juventus, Manchester City, FC Barcelona, and Paris Saint-Germain. It equips the club supporters with limited editions of fan tokens. Sports is a lucrative sector worldwide, with fans investing heavily in merchandise and fan tokens to support their favorite teams. The platform&#8217;s native token CHZ is the currency for purchasing these fan tokens through smart contracts. These fan tokens are offered in limited supply to preserve their scarcity and uniqueness. The Chiliz development team posted the progressive strides the network has made in 2022 and early 2023 on Twitter. It has formed new partnerships with notable partners such as Italian Serie A teams, MLS teams, and SL Benfica. Also, the Scoville Testnet upgrade launched in 2022 has recorded success in stages 1-5. According to the development team, Stage 6 will launch in 2023. CHZ Price Prediction Where Is it Headed? Chiliz (CHZ) is trading at 0.1461, a 5.29% increase in the token&#8217;s value. The Chiliz token is in an uptrend, as the formation of consecutive green candles with higher highs indicates. CHZ is trading above its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and below its 200-day (SMA). It implies a short-term rally as the bulls seize control of the market. The support levels are $0.130459, $0.133246, and $0.136924, while the resistance levels are $0.143388, $0.146176, and $0.146176.   Chiliz has broken its first resistance level of $0.133246 and turned it to support, leading to a positive movement on the charts. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 64.85, showing that Chiliz is close to the buy zone but not in the overbought region. If the bullish pressure sustains,  Chiliz will likely surpass its next resistance level soon. The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) is now above the signal line. It also indicates slight bullish pressure. However, the MACD is still tentative and reflects a possible reversal if the bears seize control.
