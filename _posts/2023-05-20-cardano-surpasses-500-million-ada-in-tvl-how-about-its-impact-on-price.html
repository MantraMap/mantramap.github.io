The total value locked (TVL) on the Cardano blockchain has hit a significant milestone after crossing 500 million ADA. This would come just a month and a few days after TapTools predicted an exponential increase in the network’s TVL. In this prediction, TapTools, a Cardano portfolio tracker, also reported different factors that could be pivotal to Cardano’s explosive growth in the coming months.

This is equivalent to $186.18 million when converted to U.S. dollars. Source: DefiLlama This new milestone represents a staggering 91.9% increase in total value locked since the turn of the year. Meanwhile, in the last month, Cardano’s TVL has jumped by nearly 8%, indicating a steady adoption of its DeFi ecosystem. On-chain data shows that Minswap is, by a distance, the leading protocol on the network, with a TVL of $55.56 million. In fact, the decentralized exchange boasts a market share dominance of 29.84%. Minswap protocol is followed by Indigo, a collateralized debt protocol, with a total value of $28.5 million locked on it. WingRiders, Liqwid, and Djed Stablecoin are three other notable protocols on the Cardano DeFi ecosystem, with TVLs of $17.51 million, $15.42 million, and $13.71 million, respectively. It is important to note that total value locked is a metric that estimates the amount of cryptocurrency locked in DeFi protocols on a particular blockchain. It is calculated by summing up the value of all the crypto assets locked in various DeFi protocols on a blockchain. TVL can be represented in the native token of a blockchain (as in ADA for Cardano) or in USD. ADA Price Shows No Significant Action A skyrocketing total value locked is often an indicator of increased activity in a DeFi ecosystem. However, Cardano’s impressive TVL growth hasn&#8217;t particularly impacted the price of ADA, the blockchain’s native token. As of this writing, one ADA token trades at $0.3655, losing 1% of its value in the last 24 hours. The price of ADA has been moving sideways recently, dipping by only 0.5% in the last seven days.

The cryptocurrency boasts a daily trading volume of approximately $129.3 million.  According to data from CoinGecko, ADA ranks as the seventh-largest cryptocurrency, with a total market cap of $12.79 billion.
