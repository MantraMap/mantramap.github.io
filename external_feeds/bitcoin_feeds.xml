<h2>The Dollarization Option</h2>
<p>As the Argentinian currency &#x2014; the peso &#x2014; continued with the slide that has seen it depreciate by more than 40% over the past twelve months, Micheal Saylor, the founder of Microstrategy, has chimed in by tweeting that people living in the South American country now &#x201C;need bitcoin.&#x201D; In a subsequent <a href="https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1650901174755663874">tweet</a>, Saylor, a bitcoin critic turned advocate, also shared news about the South American country&#x2019;s inflation rate after it topped 7.58% per day.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you live in Argentina&#x1F1E6;&#x1F1F7; right now, you need <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/bitcoin?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#bitcoin</a>.</p>
<p>&#x2014; Michael Saylor&#x26A1;&#xFE0F; (@saylor) <a href="https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1649874749294608391?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 22, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The tweets by Saylor, whose firm is one of the largest corporate holders of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, came as reports suggested that some Argentinian politicians favor replacing the peso with the U.S. dollar. As <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/argentina-debates-dollarization-in-the-midst-of-rampant-devaluation-and-inflation/">reported</a> by Bitcoin.com News, the Argentinian presidential aspirant Javier Milei has said dollarization can put the brakes on inflation, which officially stood at 103.4% in March.</p>
<p>Milei, who is seen as a frontrunner in presidential elections set to be held on Oct. 22, said he plans to shut down the central bank before starting the dollarization process. Steve Hanke, a professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University, has similarly suggested the South American country can only escape its present predicament by dollarizing.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Argentina has turned into an over-indebted IMF deadbeat. By my measure, the Argentinian peso has depreciated against the USD by 52% since Jan 1, 2022. ARG must dump the peso and dollarize NOW. Argentina, THE WORLD'S BIGGEST DEADBEAT. <a href="https://t.co/4HyFei1WzO">pic.twitter.com/4HyFei1WzO</a></p>
<p>&#x2014; Steve Hanke (@steve_hanke) <a href="https://twitter.com/steve_hanke/status/1650955840151515165?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 25, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Yet, despite the apparent widespread support for dollarization in Argentina, critics of the U.S. dollar, including Saylor&#x2019;s followers on Twitter, have voiced their support for his call on residents to choose bitcoin instead.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h2>Policy Brief: Argentina&#x2019;s Fiscal Imbalances Will Not Go Away After Dollarization</h2>
<p>However, some of Saylor&#x2019;s followers on Twitter like Manu Ferrari B, a self-proclaimed &#x201C;liberty maximalist,&#x201D; have <a href="https://twitter.com/manuferraritano/status/1650148801015939076">said</a> <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> is too volatile and therefore it cannot be a viable alternative to the falling peso just yet. The user suggested that while it is possible for a bitcoin-backed stablecoin to become the solution, more still needs to be done. He added:</p>
<blockquote><p>But the whole tech is not ready, yet. Most bitcoiners not living in Argentina, L&#xED;bano, Venezuela will not understand this. Most bitcoiners talking about Argentina don&#x2019;t know what they are talking about. Completely centralized stablecoins running on fiat legacy rails are also not a solution.</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition to being an expensive undertaking, dollarizing the Argentinian economy would result in the country&#x2019;s central bank becoming subservient to the policies of the U.S. Federal Reserve. Dollarizing would also see the country&#x2019;s central bank losing seigniorage &#x2014; the profit earned from printing currency.</p>
<p>A policy brief published by the Policy Center for the New South on April 28, 2022, described the calls for dollarizing the economy as the &#x201C;revival of a zombie idea.&#x201D; Denouncing the Argentinian Congress&#x2019; proposal to retain the greenback as the country&#x2019;s primary currency, the brief <a href="https://www.policycenter.ma/publications/dollarization-argentina-revival-zombie-idea">warned</a> that the country&#x2019;s &#x201C;fiscal imbalances will not be eliminated by dollarization.&#x201D; The brief also said dollarization would further require &#x201C;a selective default of domestic currency liabilities, a brutal devaluation, and/or a unilateral conversion of public deposits.&#x201D;</p>

<h2>Trump on Inflation, Dollar Crashing, World War III</h2>
<p>Donald Trump released a video Tuesday following Joe Biden&#8217;s announcement that he is running for the president of the United States in 2024.</p>
<p>The former U.S. president began by outlining the damage to the U.S. economy caused by Biden in a few short years, including his &#8220;spending calamity.&#8221; Trump described:</p>
<blockquote><p>American families are being decimated by the worst inflation in half a century. Banks are failing, our currency is crashing, and the dollar will soon no longer be the world standard, which will be our greatest defeat in over 200 years.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Joe Biden has led us to the very brink of World War III,” Trump continued. However, he clarified: “I&#8217;m not predicting World War III but I will say this, we are very close.” He then promised that if he&#8217;s elected president in 2024, &#8220;we will prevent World War III from happening.&#8221;</p>

<p>Trump recently warned that China is trying to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/former-us-president-donald-trump-states-china-is-trying-to-replace-the-dollar-as-number-one-currency/">displace</a> the U.S. dollar as the number one currency throughout the world. He also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/former-president-donald-trump-likens-us-losing-currency-war-against-china-to-america-losing-a-world-war/">cautioned</a> that the USD losing its world&#8217;s reserve currency status is like America &#8220;losing a world war,&#8221; emphasizing: &#8220;We’ll be a second-tier country.&#8221;</p>
<p>This week, the deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, Dmitry Medvedev, also urged all countries to make efforts to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russia-calls-for-prevention-of-full-scale-world-war-iii-official-warns-world-tensions-are-white-hot/">avoid</a> the outbreak of a new, full-scale global conflict. “We all need to work to ensure that this threat of global confrontation, of a hot, full-scale World War III should not materialize,” the Russian official said.</p>

Commenting on de-dollarization on a “massive scale,” he stressed: “It&#8217;s a weaponization of our U.S. dollar against the world … It&#8217;s all coming down fast right now.”</strong></p>
<h2>Robert Kiyosaki on De-Dollarization on ‘Massive Scale’</h2>
<p>The author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, is back with more dire predictions about the U.S. economy, the dollar, and global economic chaos. Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. Over 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries.</p>
<p>During his Rich Dad radio show, which aired last week, Kiyosaki discussed de-dollarization with Andy Schectman, CEO of Miles Franklin Precious Metals Investments.</p>
<p>Schectman began by highlighting recent events that led to what he described as &#8220;de-dollarization on a massive scale,” including the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/french-president-emmanuel-macron-states-europe-must-reduce-its-dependence-on-the-us-dollar-to-avoid-becoming-vassals/">meeting</a> between French President Emmanuel Macron and Chinese President Xi Jinping. “When our allies are breaking rank, it is going to speed things up, I believe, tremendously,” he emphasized.</p>
<p>Kiyosaki concurred, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s a weaponization of our U.S. dollar against the world and the world&#8217;s pissed off about it right now … It&#8217;s all coming down fast right now. It&#8217;s going faster and faster.</p></blockquote>
<p>The two proceeded to discuss the catalysts for the rising de-dollarization trend across the globe. They include Saudi Arabia entering trade alliances with China, Russia, India, and Pakistan to step further away from U.S. dollar reliance and China <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/china-makes-advances-in-ditching-the-us-dollar-for-settlements-inks-deal-with-brazil-and-completes-first-yuan-lng-purchase/">settling</a> trades with Brazil in local currencies. They also mentioned the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-currency-will-erode-us-dollars-dominance-former-white-house-economist-warns/">BRICS nations&#8217; de-dollarization efforts</a> and the economic bloc potentially launching a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-nations-working-on-creating-new-currency-to-be-discussed-at-next-leaders-summit/">new currency</a>. Several countries, such as <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indonesia-is-following-brics-de-dollarization-lead-says-central-bank-governor/">Indonesia</a>, are also following the BRICS’ lead and shifting away from the U.S. dollar for trade settlements. The BRICS countries are Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.</p>
<h2>Gresham&#8217;s Law and Triffin&#8217;s Dilemma &#8216;Violated&#8217;</h2>
<p>“There are two basic laws that are violated,” the Rich Dad Poor Dad author explained. “When Nixon, in ‘71, took the dollar off the gold standard, what happened was that he violated Gresham&#8217;s Law, and Gresham&#8217;s Law says when bad money enters a system, good money goes into hiding.”</p>
<p>Kiyosaki continued: “The second law is Triffin&#8217;s Dilemma and that happened in 1944. What happened in 1944 at the Bretton Woods agreement in New Hampshire was the world said that we agree that the world will trade in U.S. dollars … but now the Bretton Woods agreement is falling apart.”</p>
<p>The famous author added: “Triffin&#8217;s Dilemma meant the U.S. had to supply dollars to every central bank throughout the world, so we had to print probably quadrillions of dollars.&#8221; However, he stressed that when the BRICS nations gang up against &#8220;the playground bully, the U.S.,&#8221; they say: &#8220;Take your dollars back.&#8221; Kiyosaki then warned:</p>
<blockquote><p>When those dollars come roaring back into America, we have a thing called hyperinflation, and every time there’s hyperinflation, guess what happens, dictators arise and when dictators arise, the murder starts.</p></blockquote>

<p>Schectman shared: “You will wake up Monday morning and it&#8217;ll be: &#8216;Oh my God, what just happened.&#8217; Because in the middle of the night, while we were all sleeping, all of the OPEC members who are all on the <a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/chinas-massive-belt-and-road-initiative">Belt and Road Initiative</a>, they&#8217;ll stand arm-in-arm and say: ‘We&#8217;ve decided … we&#8217;re going to take the yuan until the new BRICS currency is out.’ Whatever they say, those dollars will start flooding home before we can even wake up and we&#8217;ll wake up to interest rates spiking … and the whole system in chaos.”</p>
<p>Citing a video by Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio explaining “the changing of world order,” Kiyosaki stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>Out of all this chaos … the dollar is going to come back in trillions — hyperinflation, war breaks out, starvation increases … I hate to say this, and I hope I&#8217;m wrong, it&#8217;s the end of the American Empire. It happens all the time and it doesn&#8217;t happen peacefully.</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, Kiyosaki is planning to buy more gold. He tweeted Monday: “Gold to crash. Steve Van Meter, whom I respect, predicts gold to crash to $1,000. He states markets are tired of waiting for gold to go higher. If gold drops to $1,000 I will buy more. I am an investor, not a trader. To me, gold, silver, and bitcoin are real money. To me cash is trash.”</p>

The company maintained that the regulatory body&#8217;s enforcement actions were in direct contrast to the agency&#8217;s previous approval of the firm&#8217;s public listing via its S-1 filing. Coinbase asserted in its response to the SEC that it is the “innocent investors who stand to lose the most from the commission’s abrupt about-face.”</strong></p>
<h2>Coinbase Responds to U.S. Securities Watchdog&#8217;s Wells Notice</h2>
<p>Coinbase&#8217;s CEO, Brian Armstrong, <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1651668247811624960?s=20">presented</a> his company&#8217;s response to the U.S. securities regulator on Thursday, divulging their <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/c5bd0wqjc7v0/2pW56ln6rPJ7koLHlu2L8G/5041e0166c408698b621fde543539d76/2023-04-19_Coinbase_Wells_Submission.pdf">Wells response</a>. In direct opposition to the SEC&#8217;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-informs-crypto-exchange-coinbase-of-potential-securities-law-violations/">enforcement actions</a>, Coinbase maintains a firm disagreement, while the correspondence made it clear that the regulator should have been aware of this stance when Coinbase went public.</p>

<p>The animosity between the two entities was further highlighted in Coinbase&#8217;s response, where the exchange explained that the SEC had neglected to provide clear guidelines for the regulator’s recent enforcement actions.</p>
<p>“If the commission had believed in April 2021 that Coinbase’s core businesses violated securities law, it would have been required by its own mandate to prevent the S-1 from becoming effective to protect the investing public,” the response says. “Instead, it allowed the offering to proceed, and millions of members of the public invested their savings in Coinbase. Investors could only infer by this approval that the Commission did not think Coinbase’s core business was unlawful.”</p>

<h2>Coinbase CEO: &#8216;We’re Confident in the Facts and on the Law&#8217;</h2>
<p>On Thursday, Armstrong reaffirmed Coinbase&#8217;s commitment to creating innovative products that promote economic freedom. “We are committed to building in the U.S. and around the world,” <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1651668391307128832?s=20">declared</a> the Coinbase CEO. “We will defend ourselves and stand up for the rule of law.”</p>
<p>Coinbase&#8217;s Wells response conveyed its bewilderment at the regulatory body&#8217;s abrupt change in attitude, particularly given the exchange&#8217;s extensive interaction with the SEC during its public listing process. “The staff’s laundry list of proposed charges all rest on three primary legal theories, each of which is flawed and untested,” asserted the missive.</p>
<p>Coinbase&#8217;s Wells response comes on the heels of the company&#8217;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-files-legal-action-against-sec-over-lack-of-regulatory-clarity/">announcement</a> that it had initiated legal proceedings in federal court, demanding that the SEC respond to their petition filed in July of 2022. Similarly, the Wells response pledged to continue cooperating with the SEC in the hopes of amicably resolving the matter.</p>

According to official data from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, the Chinese yuan rose to be the most-used currency in March over the U.S. dollar, in a push from the Beijing government to internationalize its currency for payments.</strong></p>
<h2>Chinese Yuan Used to Settle Most of China&#8217;s International Payments in March</h2>
<p>Beijing is now settling most of its international trade operations using the Chinese yuan. According to official <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/yuan-overtakes-dollar-become-most-used-currency-chinas-cross-border-transactions-2023-04-26/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">numbers</a> from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, a Chinese national institution in charge of managing China&#8217;s international reserve, the payments settled using the Chinese yuan overtook those made with U.S. dollars in March, being used in 48.4% of all settlements.</p>
<p>The Chinese yuan was used to settle $549.9 billion in payments, a record number, rising from $434.5 billion in February. The usage of the U.S. dollar for these payments fell from 48.6% to 46.7% during the same period.</p>
<p>China has been increasing reliance on its currency due to recent geopolitical challenges that have been used as a rationale for the U.S. to apply sanctions to Russia, affecting also Chinese companies accused of serving as proxies for the Russian government and its institutions.</p>

<h2>Yuan Usage Has Grown</h2>
<p>However, internationally, the usage of the Chinese yuan for settlements is minuscule when compared to the volumes settled in U.S. dollars, even with the implementation of sanctions. During March, the usage of the Chinese Yuan in global international payments rose to 4.5%, while the U.S. dollar accounted for 83.71% of all volume settled, according to data from SWIFT, a global banking payments system.</p>
<p>However, this marks an increase compared to the usage numbers of December, when the Chinese renminbi only accounted for 2.15% of all global payments, according to SWIFT&#8217;s renminbi <a href="https://www.swift.com/our-solutions/compliance-and-shared-services/business-intelligence/renminbi/rmb-tracker/rmb-tracker-document-centre" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tracker</a>. This means that the yuan&#8217;s usage has more than doubled during Q1 2023.</p>
<p>This, and other recent trade agreements that have led countries like <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/putin-xi-vow-to-use-yuan-as-russia-and-china-move-to-settlements-in-national-currencies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Russia</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/china-makes-advances-in-ditching-the-us-dollar-for-settlements-inks-deal-with-brazil-and-completes-first-yuan-lng-purchase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brazil</a> to settle their bilateral payments with China using national currencies or the Chinese yuan, have alarmed some analysts regarding the possible rise of a &#8220;bipolar&#8221; economic world.</p>
<p>Economist Nouriel Roubini recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/roubini-were-shifting-to-bipolar-global-reserve-currency-system-with-chinese-yuan-as-alternative-to-us-dollar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a> that rivals of the U.S. would probably group around the yuan to propose it as an alternative to the U.S. dollar. In the same way, billionaire investor Ray Dalio <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/dollar-dominance-fading-amid-growing-china-trade-russia-sanctions-risks-ray-dalio-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted</a> the importance of the U.S. dollar in international trade is fading, thanks to the sanctions that the country has imposed on other countries.</p>

Meanwhile, those utilizing the privacy-boosting protocol Cashfusion have fused over 17.4 million bitcoin cash since its inception, equivalent to a staggering $2 billion in U.S. dollar value.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>General Protocols Reveals Latest Defi Application Release</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
The Bitcoin Cash community eagerly awaits an upgrade that promises to revolutionize the creation of decentralized applications on May 15, 2023. Last November, blockchain developer Jason Dreyzehner <a href="https://twitter.com/bitjson/status/1592576789553246208?s=20">shared the news</a> that the 2023 upgrade had been successfully added to the testnet network. Dreyzehner elaborated on the forthcoming improvements, which will introduce Cashtokens capable of generating a <a href="https://github.com/bitjson/cashtokens/blob/master/examples.md">plethora of possibilities</a>, from identity tokens and covenant-tracking identity tokens, to voting with fungible tokens, sealed voting, multithreaded covenants, and multi-covenant decentralized applications.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In the interim, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a> enthusiasts have been introduced to the full-fledged production version of <a href="https://bchbull.com/">BCH Bull</a>. The decentralized finance (defi) application <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/decentralized-app-bch-bull-prepares-for-launch-platform-allows-users-to-long-or-hedge-bitcoin-cash-against-a-myriad-of-tradeable-assets/">empowers users</a> to long or hedge their <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a> against various tradable assets. The project&#x2019;s developers announced the latest release on April 17, 2023, and disclosed several new enhancements, adding to the platform&#x2019;s appeal. &#x201C;<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a> Bull Production release is out,&#x201D; the defi application&#x2019;s devs <a href="https://twitter.com/BCH_BULL/status/1647901414696550401?s=20">announced</a> on Twitter. &#x201C;2x the contract size, 3x the contract duration, approx 30% cheaper fees, additional asset (CNY), premium tracker and language localization.&#x201D;&#13;<br />

<h2>Cashfusion Fuses $2B in Value Since Inception</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
April marked yet another significant milestone for Cashfusion, as the number of fusions jumped beyond $2 billion in value since its inception on November 28, 2019. Presently, over <a href="https://stats.sploit.cash/#/fusion">17.4 million</a> bitcoin cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a>) has been fused, currently valued at $2,049,395,837 according to current <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a> exchange rates. This achievement has come at a time when Coinjoin processes have come under <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/trezor-enables-coinjoin-for-trezor-t-model-to-bolster-a-new-era-of-privacy/">intense scrutiny</a>. Both Cashfusion and Conjoin techniques are employed to obscure the origin and destination of crypto transactions, but their approaches and levels of privacy differ vastly.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
While Coinjoin combines multiple crypto transactions, making it difficult to determine which inputs are associated with which outputs, it is not infallible as some patterns can still be identified. In contrast, Cashfusion is considered a more <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/privacy-enhancing-protocol-cashfusion-completes-security-analysis/">sophisticated privacy technique</a> that utilizes a multi-party computation (MPC) protocol to blend transactions in such a way that even the participants cannot decipher which inputs are associated with which outputs. Data analyst James Waugh conducted tests on Cashfusion in 2020 and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cashfusion-practical-says-data-analyst/">strongly endorsed</a> the scheme&#x2019;s practicality over other Coinjoin methods.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
With just 18 days left before the much-anticipated <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a> upgrade, Bitcoin Cash supporters are looking forward to the introduction of additional privacy-enhancing, decentralized applications. While they await the upgrade, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a> proponents are still taking advantage of tools like <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a> Bull and Cashfusion. Along with the impressive Cashfusion milestone, this privacy application has now been integrated into the Electron Cash mobile wallet for Android systems, bolstering its accessibility.&#13;<br />

<h2>Optimistic Outlook for Ethereum as Finder Survey Forecasts $5,491 by 2025 and $14,814 by 2030</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Crypto and fintech specialists have convened to predict ethereum&#x2019;s (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) future price in the latest <a href="https://www.finder.com/ethereum-price-prediction-2023">Finder&#x2019;s prediction report</a>. Along with the projected price, the Shapella upgrade has been a topic of discussion among the Finder survey&#x2019;s respondents.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Out of the total number of panelists, 21% expressed their concern over the potential centralization of the Ethereum network following the implementation of Shapella. Furthermore, half of the professionals surveyed anticipated an increase in regulatory scrutiny of the project in light of the upgrade.&#13;</p>

A consensus among the majority of Finder&#x2019;s experts was reached, indicating that ether will attain a peak of about $2,758 this year, but eventually fall within the range of $2,342 per unit by year-end. Regarding the panel&#x2019;s opinions, 53% of the respondents recommended the purchase of ethereum at present, while 13% proposed it is time to sell. The remaining 33% of panelists suggested holding on to ethereum and patiently awaiting the opportune moment.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Paul Levy, a senior lecturer at the University of Brighton, is of the view that ether will conclude 2023 at $2,200 per coin. Levy believes that people have faith in ether&#x2019;s future potential since it &#x201C;is seen as a stable option offering more dependable continuity amidst the collapse of less rigorously tested platforms and coins.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The team of experts at Finder.com has also expressed their belief that ether will reach $5,491 by the conclusion of 2025, and they have further forecasted that by 2030, a solitary unit of ether will exchange for $14,814. Despite the consensus prediction of $2,342 per unit by the end of the year, some panelists were more optimistic about ethereum&#x2019;s future prospects, anticipating even higher prices.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Ilya Volkov, CEO of Youhodler, is one such optimist, forecasting an end-of-year price of $2,600 per unit. &#x201C;<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> as the second-largest cryptocurrency will continue to correlate with <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> and increase in price in the long distance,&#x201D; Volkov expressed. Damian Chmiel, a senior analyst and editor at Finance Magnates, predicts an even higher price point of $3K per <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> by the year&#x2019;s end.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Chmiel wrote:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>The three-thousand-dollar level is merely a return to the prices of a year ago, far from a speculative bull run, and only allowing for a more honest and fundamental valuation of the asset.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#13;</p>
<h2>Experts Think SEC Could Declare Ether Is a Security</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
In addition, 50% of the expert panel at Finder.com have expressed their belief that ethereum is presently &#x201C;priced fairly,&#x201D; whereas 40% contend that it is &#x201C;underpriced.&#x201D; A smaller 10% faction is of the opinion that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> is currently &#x201C;overpriced.&#x201D; Ruadhan O, the creator of Seasonal Tokens, has set his sights on an end-of-year price of $2,200 per unit. Ruadhan O underlined his concern regarding the potential classification of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> as a security by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;Ethereum could be classified as a security by the SEC, because Ethereum investors are effectively betting on the future performance of the developers,&#x201D; Ruadhan O said. &#x201C;The New York Attorney General has recently made this argument in a lawsuit against Kucoin, and the SEC may adopt the same argument as it seeks to assert jurisdiction over Ethereum.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The latest Finder&#x2019;s ethereum prediction report is higher than the forecast experts <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ethereum-to-reach-peak-of-2474-per-token-in-2023-finders-survey-of-crypto-and-fintech-experts-reveals/">predicted in January 2023</a>.

<h2>South Korean Prosecutors Claim Do Kwon and Terraform Labs Still Own $100 Million Tucked Away in a Swiss Bank Account, SEC Complaint Backs Theory</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
As <a href="https://www.digitalasset.works/news/articleView.html?idxno=2310">reported</a> by Park Beom-soo, a local journalist, following the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-terraform-labs-co-founder-indicted-on-fraud-charges-in-south-korea/">Terraform Labs indictment</a>, Do Kwon and his associates allegedly transferred 10,000 <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> to a fintech bank headquartered in Switzerland. Sygnum Bank, a digital asset financial institution based in Zurich, was reportedly the recipient of this sizable transfer. It has since come to light that the Seoul Southern District Prosecutor&#x2019;s Office has been closely monitoring the movement of Terra-linked bitcoin and has revealed this information during a press conference held to discuss the recent indictment.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The prosecutor&#x2019;s office&#x2019;s spokesperson stated, &#x201C;We are actively tracking the bitcoin owned by LFG (Luna Foundation Guard), but some of it has been converted into cash and deposited into the Signum account. As outlined in the SEC complaint, the amount transferred is approximately 100 million dollars (about 130 billion won).&#x201D; It would appear that the investigation into Terraform Labs and Do Kwon&#x2019;s financial dealings is ongoing, and further details may come to light concerning this matter.&#13;</p>
<h2>Onchain Researcher: LFG &#x2018;Failed to Account for the Trail of Bread Crumbs Left by the Change Outputs&#x2019;</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Just before Terra collapsed, Terra&#x2019;s Luna Foundation Guard (LFG), an organization created to defend the blockchain stablecoin UST&#x2019;s dollar peg, accumulated a massive amount of bitcoin. The funds were meant to protect UST from dropping below the $1 parity but the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/a-dark-day-for-crypto-a-deep-dive-into-the-obliterated-terra-token-ecosystem-and-damaged-apps/">fallout was so bad</a>, LFG and Terra&#x2019;s leaders like Do Kwon could not save it. After the collapse, it was speculated that LFG did not use all the funds to defend the stablecoin, and LFG fired back by <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/terras-2-8b-defense-system-luna-foundation-guard-audit-says-group-spent-more-than-80000-bitcoin-defending-ust-peg/">releasing an audit</a> that claimed the group used more than 80,000 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> to defend the coin&#x2019;s peg.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
However, OXT researcher Ergo <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> discovered that the blockchain &#x201C;tells a different story&#x201D; in a <a href="https://twitter.com/ErgoBTC/status/1577732461257232385?s=20">Twitter thread</a> from October 2022. Ergo said that while LFG may have declared ownership of a single wallet holding 313 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, their actions have left a breadcrumb trail of evidence that could be easily followed. Ergo discovered a group of fifteen significant Binance withdrawals made to a single address. The coins were then consolidated and used in a series of transactions spanning several months. Shortly after the first withdrawal from Binance, 665 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> were spent on Kucoin, and on May 16, the remaining 313 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> were transferred to the new LFG address, providing evidence of their association.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Ergo further <a href="https://twitter.com/ErgoBTC/status/1577732493087834112?s=20">said</a> that the sequence of transactions continued for many months and &#x201C;unfortunately for the LFG, these (reused addresses) were active prior the depeg event, providing additional clues for investigators.&#x201D; The researcher further added that while the LFG may argue that the pseudonymity of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> provides them with a veil of anonymity, it is clear that the activity the researcher observed is &#x201C;directly related to the funding of the LFG treasury.&#x201D; Park Beom-soo&#x2019;s report <a href="https://twitter.com/ErgoBTC/status/1650828462569996291?s=20">further confirmed</a> to Ergo that the onchain activity the OXT researcher monitored aligns more closely with the Seoul prosecutor&#x2019;s report than the story told by Do Kwon and the LFG audit.&#13;<br />

Future increases will depend on the economic data but this is still not the right time to stop, according to Philip Lane who believes the bank has to bring inflation back to the 2% target “in a timely manner.”</strong></p>
<h2>Leaving Interest Rate at Current Level Would Be ‘Inappropriate’ Despite Falling Inflation, Lane Says</h2>
<p>Inflation in the euro area has dropped significantly between October, when it peaked at 10.6%, and March’s 6.9%. Nevertheless, the most important goal for its central bank is to make sure that it gets closer to 2%, Chief Economist of the ECB Philip Lane told Le Monde in a recent interview <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2023/html/ecb.in230425~cea897f3a0.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> by the bank on Tuesday.</p>
<p>While easing in some sectors, such as energy, inflationary pressures persist in others, like food, the top official noted, warning there’s a risk of “sticky” inflation. This is why it’s important that the ECB raises its interest rates again to ensure inflation returns to the target “in a timely manner,” he emphasized.</p>
<p>Inflation has been too high for almost two years, Lane admitted, attributing it to bottlenecks created by the pandemic and the energy shock resulting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. To deal with it, the ECB increased interest rates by 3.5 percentage points, from -0.5% to 3%, which is unprecedented for the eurozone.</p>
<p>“For our next Governing Council meeting on May 4, the current data are indicating that we should raise rates again,” said Philip Lane who sits on the bank’s Executive Board. He added that the analysis suggests it would be “inappropriate” to leave the deposit rate at the current 3% level and stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is still not the right time to stop. Beyond that, I don’t have a crystal ball, it will depend on the economic data.</p></blockquote>
<p>The most important task is to bring inflation closer to 2% “within a reasonable time period,” ECB’s chief economist reiterated. The longer it stays too high, the greater the risk that people lose faith in the bank’s ability to return to its long-term target, he reasoned.</p>
<p>Lane’s statements for the French press come after several central bank governors, members of the ECB’s Governing Council, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/europeans-to-see-more-interest-rate-hikes-central-bank-governors-indicate/">indicated</a> in the past few weeks that a new rate hike is to be expected from the upcoming meeting next month.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The release of the Iskra Launchpad comes right after Iskra dominated the number one spot on DappRadar’s blockchain games dapp </span><a href="https://dappradar.com/rankings"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rankings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for all periods &#8211; 24 hours, 7 days, and 30 days &#8211; with 669.27k UAW as of writing and cited as one of the </span><a href="https://twitter.com/DappRadar/status/1644033046927011840?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">best-performing games dapp</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for March 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Iskra Launchpad is a platform that allows game companies working with Iskra to promote their tokens to the Iskra community via IGO before its official listing on an exchange. Through the Iskra Launchpad, the Iskra community will have the opportunity to discover visionary games at an early stage and purchase tokens at its offering price. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While tokens purchased on the Iskra Launchpad during an IGO are locked and subject to a vesting and distribution schedule, every IGO token has a corresponding “Express Token” that can be immediately used for other utilities. This unique feature allows IGO participants to concurrently enjoy exclusive uses such as purchasing NFTs on the Iskra Market, accessing exclusive invites to events like CBTs, and enjoying other in-game benefits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">World of Win, the first project that will hold its IGO on the Iskra Launchpad, is the platform’s first social casino and arcade offering, which showcases the best in slots and hyper casual skill-based games. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By playing World of Win, users can enjoy the thrill of playing in a casino without the gambling aspect of gaming as there is no cash-out feature involved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WoW Labs, the company behind World of Win, will be offering its WoW token for the first time during the IGO, which builds up to the public launch of the game that is expected to happen soon afterwards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are excited to kick off our service with the Iskra community and be an addition to the premier gaming catalog of the platform,” Sam [Family Name], founder and CEO of WoW Labs, explained. “Social casino is a unique and widely popular genre. The thrill that comes with games of chance is something that I’ve seen as a missed opportunity in crypto gaming, as a Web3 gaming and crypto enthusiast myself. WOW Labs is filling that gap by introducing the full blown social casino experience to the Web3 gamers.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By launching World of Win, WOW Labs aims to introduce the first social casino gaming experience to Web3 gamers. The hyper casual and skill-based tournament games run on an hourly basis, which gives users speedy and dynamic play-and-earn experience, while WoW’s DeFi-inspired Piggy Bank NFTs allow more coins for continuous play. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The release of the Iskra Launchpad, as well as the launch of World of Win, adds another milestone to the several available services and games that Iskra offers to its growing community. According to Spike Ryu, Chief Operating Officer of Iskra, “the company is focused on steadily rolling out games and services, so that it can demonstrate the full potential of community engagement in Web3 gaming.”</span></p>
