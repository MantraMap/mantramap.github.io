<p>The South Korean Financial Services Commission's (FSC) decision to seize Delio&rsquo;s assets cast doubts over its future operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>South Korea's crypto lending powerhouse, Delio, established in 2018, is currently navigating stormy waters. Its woes began when the FSC, a local financial watchdog, took control of both the company's and its customers' assets. This included not just the tangible assets but also their cold wallets and ledgers. The seizure, a result of an ongoing legal tussle with its depositors, has put Delio in a tight spot, making it challenging for them to offer their regular suite of services.&nbsp;</p>
A suspension of interest payments
<p>The firm has emphasised the need to safeguard its assets, especially considering the interests of its depositors. In light of these events, Delio made the tough call to suspend interest payments to its deposit and vault users starting July 24. This move was not isolated; other services that demanded additional expenditures, like operational costs, were also put on hold.&nbsp;</p>
Deposits and withdrawals stopped
<p>This decision has understandably heightened concerns among their clientele. Delio's recent actions can be traced back to June 14 when they abruptly stopped deposits and withdrawals on their platform. This move was a protective measure against market volatility, which was exacerbated by similar actions from their sister lending company, Haru Invest. Haru Invest's decision to halt withdrawals was influenced by the discovery of misleading information from its consignment operator, B&amp;S Holdings.</p>
FSC gets involved&nbsp;
<p>The FSC's involvement deepened when they initiated an investigation into Delio's sudden transaction suspension. This probe culminated in a lawsuit against Delio, accusing them of fraud, embezzlement, and breach of trust. The fallout from this legal action saw travel restrictions placed on Delio's CEO, Jeong Sang-ho, among others.&nbsp;</p>
One of the largest crypto lending platforms
<p>Despite the shadows currently cast on Delio, it's vital to recognize their significant standing in the crypto realm. They are one of South Korea's premier crypto lending platforms, boasting a vast array of services from custody to staking. Their impressive portfolio includes about $1 billion in Bitcoin, $200 million in Ether, and a staggering $8.1 billion in various other altcoins.</p>
