<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ronaldo-binance-second-nft-collection/">Ronaldo Teams with Binance to Launch His Second NFT Collection</a></p>
<p>Cristiano Ronaldo expanded his presence in the world of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFTs</a> today, on June 3, by launching his second NFT on Binance. On July 2, Ronaldo announced the NFT on his official Twitter page. Interpreted into English, he <a href="https://twitter.com/Cristiano/status/1675414046126874631" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I am excited to launch my 2nd collection of NFTs on #Binance!&#8230; Join me on my NFT journey. ForeverCR7: The GOAT collection coming soon! Let&#8217;s go!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The post had more than 80,000 likes, showing the interest of his fans. After its launch today, he also announced it on his Twitter page.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I&#8217;m proud to announce that my new NFT collection &#8216;Forever CR7: The Goat&#8217; NFT is live on <a href="https://twitter.com/binance?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Binance</a> now!<br />

<p>— Cristiano Ronaldo (@Cristiano) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cristiano/status/1675866992840957952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 3, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Features of Ronaldo&#8217;s Second NFT Collection</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFT</a> collection is named &#8216;Forever CR7: The GOAT&#8217;, and focuses on Ronaldo&#8217;s big career achievements, especially his goals on the football pitch, as the greatest goalscorer of all time. The collection has 20 different designs, each representing a significant goal from Ronaldo&#8217;s career, and they also come in four tiers of rarity: the Super Super Rare, Super Rare, Rare, and Normal.</p>
<p>The Super Super Rare represents special collections that come with some advantages, like a once-in-a-lifetime training session with Cristiano Ronaldo, a Binance football shirt signed by Ronaldo, and a free ticket to a future Binance Blockchain Week, among other benefits. To benefit from the Super Super Rare NFT sale, you must participate in <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/nft/event/forevercr7?ref=FOREVERCR7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">the 48-hour auction</a>, which started at 14:00 UTC today.</p>
<p>The Super Super Rare NFTs are seven in number, and six of them will be available through a bidding system. The auction, which has already started, was to start at $15,000, and the highest bidder is to go with the token. The last token in the collection is to be reserved for special giveaways, as Binance stated on its official page.</p>
<p>Binance will also distribute 120 Super Rare NFTs and 1200 Rare NFTs. The Super Rare NFTs will go for $300, while the Rare NFTs will go for $30. There are also lower-priced options tagged &#8216;Normal NFTs&#8217;. They can be obtained through the ForeverCR7 boxes, which also have 7 NFTs in each box and go for just $10.</p>
<p>Binance Co-Founder and Chief Marketing Officer Yi He <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/binance-celebrates-the-goat-with-new-cristiano-ronaldo-nft-collection-301857763.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">stated</a> in June:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As the first drop was the most successful athlete NFT collection of all time, we wanted to keep building and creating more value for our community with this second collection.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>The Second NFT Collection May Perform Better Than the First</h2>
<p>Although <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ronaldo-binance-cr7-nft-collection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the first NFT collection</a> can be said to be the most successful by any athlete, just as the Co-Founder of Binance mentioned, one can also say that its performance would have also been affected by the state of the crypto market around the time it was launched. First, it came at a time when a lot of cryptocurrencies were far below their best performances. Second, it also came a week after the FTX crash, which affected the entire crypto and NFT markets.</p>
<p>The FTX crash shook the crypto market and surely raised the negative sentiment against crypto and digital assets like NFTs. With the crash&#8217;s impact reduced and many cryptos even rising in price for different reasons, this second release may attract more fans and is likely to perform better than the first collection.</p>

<p>Xpeng is hoping that its new car would help improve the company's losses even as it has recorded a return to quarterly growth in deliveries.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/xpeng-shares-growth-deliveries/">Xpeng Shares Jump 11% as Company Records Growth in Deliveries after Year of Declines</a></p>
<p>Shares of Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/xpeng-motors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xpeng Motors</a> (NYSE: XPEV) <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/03/xpeng-xpev-shares-jump-as-chinese-ev-maker-sees-deliveries-rise.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">rose</a> following the company’s report of car deliveries, signifying a quarterly return to growth. XPEV climbed 11% in response to the news of growth, after continuous declines for over a year.</p>
<p>According to data from MarketWatch, Xpeng shares listed in the US have climbed 42.84% over the last five days and 71.73% in a month. The shares have also seen a 31.92% increase in 3 months and nearly 46% year-to-date (YTD). However, its 1-year performance shows a 52% plunge.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Xpeng revealed a 27% quarterly increase in car deliveries for the year’s second quarter, at a total of 23,205. The figure is higher than the company’s forecast set in May &#8211; to deliver between 21,000 and 22,000 cars.</p>
<p>Xpeng said it delivered 8,620 cars in June, a 15% increase from May. June’s figure is the year’s highest so far.</p>
<p>Xpeng launched its new G6 Ultra Smart Coupe SUV at the end of Q2 and expects deliveries to begin soon. The company hopes that sales would help shore up some of its losses.</p>
<h2>Xpeng Shares and Deliveries in Q1</h2>
<p>Xpeng stock fell in May after the company <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/xpeng-shares-q1-2023-q2-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> Q1 earnings and a modest forecast for deliveries. The company reported that its Q1 revenue fell 50% year-over-year (YoY). Xpeng’s income was 4.03 billion Chinese yuan, about $571.6 million at the time, much lower than analysts’ expectation of 5.19 billion yuan. The EV maker also reported its expected net loss was 2.34 billion yuan, more than 18% higher than the expected 1.9 billion.</p>
<p>At the time, Chairman and CEO Xe Xiaopeng said he made a few decisive changes to the company’s organizational structure, senior management team, and strategy. He expressed confidence in the changes, stating they would drive product sales growth, customer satisfaction, team morale, and brand reputation.</p>
<p>Since the first quarter of 2022, Xpeng has suffered declines in deliveries each quarter. A lot of the company’s poor performance results from macroeconomic headwinds in China. The company is suffering mixed consumer spending because of an economy recovering from the effects of COVID-19 restrictions.</p>
<h2>Competition from EV Manufacturers</h2>
<p>Xpeng is also facing fierce competition from other EV makers, including <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/tesla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tesla</a> (NASDAQ: TSLA) and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/byd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BYD</a>. Last October, Tesla <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/tesla-price-cars-china-tsla-stock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cut prices</a> for its Model 3 sedan and Model Y SUV in China. At the time, the company said it cut prices because it had earlier increased them following a rise in the cost of raw materials.</p>
<p>In January this year, Tesla <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/tesla-cut-price-model-3-y-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> further price reductions in China for both cars amid growing competition. The company then announced a <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/price-cuts-tesla-model-3-model-y/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">price cut</a> in the US in March and a further reduction in April. However, in early May, Tesla hiked prices for its Model S and Model X vehicles by 19,000 yuan, about $2,751.</p>
<p>In June, EV maker Nio <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/nio-cuts-down-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cut prices</a> by nearly $4,200 even though CEO William Li claimed the company would not join a “price war”.</p>

<p>The Gemini founders filed for the first Bitcoin ETF with the US SEC ten years ago, which was rejected for almost the same reason the recent BlackRock and Fidelity products were dismissed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/winklevoss-sec-bitcoin-etf-product/">Winklevoss Brothers Bash US SEC for Refusal to Approve Bitcoin ETF Products</a></p>
<p>The need for a regulated <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> product, including an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF), is undoubtedly mounting on the United States regulators as institutional investors, led by <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/blackrock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlackRock Inc</a> (NYSE: BLK) with nearly $10 trillion in Assets Under Management (AUM), pushes to enter the crypto industry. With the $1 trillion crypto market estimated to overtake that of precious metals in the coming years, amid ballooning global inflation, the demand for well-structured digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum can not be ignored.</p>
<p>As a result, the political divide between the Democrats and Republicans has increased when it comes to ways to regulate the nascent industry. According to the Biden administration, perhaps a view shared by most Democrats in Congress, most digital assets are unregulated securities, and investors should prepare for the digital dollar through FedNow soon.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some politicians including presidential aspirant Robert F Kennedy Jr, Bitcoin, and other crypto assets are integral parts of the financial freedom that needs to be protected. As a result, experts forecast a great rift in next year’s US presidential election on matters pertaining to crypto assets.</p>
<h2>Winklevoss Brothers Criticize the SEC for Not Approving Safe Bitcoin ETF Products</h2>
<p>According to Cameron Winklevoss, one of the Gemini exchanges co-founders, the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a> has pushed American crypto investors to risky products and firms like FTX for failing to approve safer avenues to access the nascent crypto market. Notably, Gemini filed for a Bitcoin ETF ten years ago but the SEC rejected the filing.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Today marks 10 years since <a href="https://twitter.com/tyler?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@tyler</a> and I filed for the first spot Bitcoin ETF. The <a href="https://twitter.com/SECGov?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SECGov</a>&#8216;s refusal to approve these products for a decade has been a complete and utter disaster for US investors and demonstrates how the SEC is a failed regulator. Here&#8217;s why:</p>
<p>-&#8220;protected&#8221;… <a href="https://t.co/xmK1xo1iX8">pic.twitter.com/xmK1xo1iX8</a></p>
<p>— Cameron Winklevoss (@cameron) <a href="https://twitter.com/cameron/status/1675302282915610624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 2, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>According to the SEC, the Bitcoin market is heavily controlled by wash trading and there are no mechanisms to avoid mass fraud. However, Cameron noted that the SEC needs to cease overstepping its statutory powers in regulating the crypto industry.</p>
<p>“Maybe the SEC will reflect on its dismal record and instead of overstepping its statutory power and trying to act like the gatekeeper of economic life, it will focus on fulfilling its mandate of investor protection,” he <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-spot-bitcoin-etf-refusal-cameron-winklevoss" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">noted</a>.</p>
<p>Notably, the crypto investor highlighted that some investors have been forced to enter the digital asset industry through regulated and risky products like Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which he referred to as toxic. Worth noting that Gemini and Digital Currency Group (DCG)- backed Genesis Trading are under court supervision after failing to meet a reasonable deal on defaulted loans.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the SEC has dismissed the recent Bitcoin ETF frenzy for lacking clarity and asked the respective firms to review their filings. The Bitcoin ETF frenzy significantly helped BTC price rebound from trading below $25k to as high as $30.8k in the past few weeks.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/eu-japan-ai-chip/">EU to Work with Japan on AI and Chip Supply Chain</a></p>
<p>European Union (EU) Commissioner Thierry Breton has <a href="https://twitter.com/ThierryBreton/status/1675387787955060736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1675387787955060736%7Ctwgr%5Ec0ec9a47efbf41e5edd58a0f6cc1c11feb1596e6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2023%2F07%2F03%2Feu-japan-look-to-partner-on-ai-chips-amid-china-de-risking-push.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">hinted</a> at the bloc&#8217;s intention to work more closely with Japan in its Artificial Intelligence (AI) and chips sector. According to the region’s industry chief, this move is part of the EU&#8217;s strategy to reduce its reliance on China in certain areas. Therefore, Breton planned to meet with Japanese government officials to discuss this agenda which has AI as a top priority.</p>
<p>“I will engage with [the] Japanese government … on how we can organize our digital space, including AI based on our shared value,” he said.</p>
<p>Their collaboration will specifically include monitoring the chip supply chain and boosting the exchange of researchers and engineers. At the same time, the EU will render support to Japanese semiconductor-inclined companies that would be interested in working within the tenets of the bloc. Notably, Japan is known to be a major player in the semiconductor supply chain ecosystem.</p>
<p>Speaking in Tokyo, the commissioner emphasized that the EU believes that it is important to secure the supply chain of semiconductors. Apart from the general desire of the EU to strengthen its semiconductor sector, Tokyo has also been looking to boost its domestic semiconductor industry. These semiconductors are useful in different product lines from cars to smartphones and even go as far as having some potential military applications.</p>
<p>He also highlighted an upcoming EU-Japan Digital Partnership Council which will touch on areas like quantum and high-performance computing.</p>
<p>South Korea recently made a similar alliance with the European Union where both nations agreed to collaborate on technologies such as AI and cybersecurity. All of these partnerships with top Asian countries that have strong technology sectors are geared towards the EU&#8217;s effort to &#8220;de-risk&#8221; China.</p>
<p>It is obvious that as the EU is retracting from China, it is also establishing several deep-rooted relationships with other countries in the area of technology.</p>
<h2>Beyond EU: There&#8217;s a Global Boost in AI Pursuit</h2>
<p>The EU is currently not the only region analyzing and reassessing its semiconductor supply chain sector.</p>
<p>Several other countries like the United States are reconsidering bringing semiconductor manufacturing back to their shores. Sometime in 2022, US President <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/joe-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joe Biden</a> hinted at plans to <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-regulations-semiconductors-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impose</a> stricter restrictions on semiconductors and chipmaking tool shipments to China. This was at the time the Commerce Department asked three US-based companies to stop sending semiconductors and chip-making equipment to China.</p>
<p>About two months ago, Great Britain also announced <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/britain-semiconductor-chips-1-2b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support</a> of £1 billion (or $1.2 billion) at the time for its semiconductor industry. The fund is focused on boosting its domestic chipmaking capabilities and reducing its dependence on foreign players just like the United States and EU. Britain has already designed a 20-year strategy for semiconductors and is inking strategic partnerships to achieve its plans.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/punk-domains-flare-network/">Web3 Domain Name Protocol Punk Domains Partners with Flare Network for More Domain Extensions</a></p>
<p>Decentralized domain name service Punk Domains has partnered with the Flare Layer-1 blockchain and has already received a few thousand registrations for its new domain extensions, including .FLR (flr domains) and .SGB (Songbird Domains).</p>
<p>Before the .FLR and .SGB extensions, Punk Domains had launched a few others, including .kilma in collaboration with klimaDAO, and .smol from the Smolverse NFT world based on Arbitrum. Other connected extensions include .dope, .giveth, . ppl, .pool, and .fantom.</p>
<p>Each domain functions as a label for a blockchain address. Anyone can use a domain to represent their profile, identity, or personal username. The domains may also function as representations of their social media handles. The option makes it easy for users to exchange all of this information or perform transactions without remembering or noting long blockchain addresses.</p>
<p>The Punk Domains and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ai-atriv-flare-layer-1-blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flare</a> partnership includes domain integration into the Bifrost wallet. This way, all Flare users can easily mint domains and transfer funds. In addition, Punk Domain will integrate Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSO) so that price fluctuations on SGB and FLR will not affect its fixed domain prices.</p>
<p>The FTSO functions by collecting external information sourced by independent data providers. These providers find data from crypto exchanges and related sources and pass the data to the oracle. The network then weighs each provider submission by its own stake, along with stake designated by holders of the Flare (FLR) token. The price estimates are then published on-chain.</p>
<p>Through this process, Flare ensures that all information eventually published is truly decentralized and impartial since Flare does not own or manage the providers.</p>
<h2>Punk Domains and Flare&#8217;s Songbird</h2>
<p>Punk Domains’ co-founders Techie.flr and Tekr.flr talked about the support received from Flare’s Songbird canary network. The duo is now anticipating more benefits of the partnership between Punk Domains, Flare, and Songbird.</p>
<blockquote><p>“When we launched our protocol on Songbird, the community welcomed us warmly and with great excitement. Their support touched us deeply and inspired us to create even more tools in this ecosystem. We’re eagerly looking forward to what lies ahead as we continue building on Flare and Songbird.”</p></blockquote>
<p>As part of its work with Songbird, Punk Domains launched a decentralized social network called <a href="https://sgb.chat/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">SGB Chat</a>. Built on Songbird, the open-source network allows users to access decentralized finance (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-decentralized-finance-defi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeFi</a>) tools, including token swaps, right on the platform. In addition, users on SGB Chat can monetize their content without fear of censorship or demonetization. SGB Chat stores all content using decentralized servers to maintain data security and integrity.</p>
<h3>About Punk Domains and Flare</h3>
<p>Punk Domains provides users with registered, permissionless, and decentralized domain names across multiple blockchains. Each domain name is used as an identity in place of personal usernames, profiles, and long alphanumeric blockchain addresses. In addition, Punk Domains owns Songbird’s first decentralized social network, SGB Chat.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth mentioning that Flare is a data-driven Layer 1 blockchain that provides developers with large-scale information. The network can offer cost-effective access to quality data with the ability to scale this access to meet developer needs. Flare also functions with a State Connector that pulls information from multiple blockchains and analyzes responses received.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-listing-pendle-price/">Binance Announces Listing for Pendle in Innovation Zone, PENDLE Price Shoots 50%</a></p>
<p>The listing for Pendle (PENLDE) in the Binance Innovation Zone is a vote of confidence for the project and it will increase the chances of trade for investors. </p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-listing-pendle-price/">Binance Announces Listing for Pendle in Innovation Zone, PENDLE Price Shoots 50%</a></p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-listing-pendle-price/">Binance Announces Listing for Pendle in Innovation Zone, PENDLE Price Shoots 50%</a></p>
<p>In the latest development, the world&#8217;s largest crypto exchange <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> announced <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-will-list-pendle-pendle-in-the-innovation-zone-56c9c5899f3747b2b9a0452450f5eb24" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">listing</a> for <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ieo/pendle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pendle</a> (PENDLE), a protocol that enables tokenization and trading of future yield, in the Binance Innovation Zone.</p>
<p>The recent listing for Pendle by Binance validates the protocol&#8217;s potential and unlocks new opportunities for investors and traders. Starting from July 3, 2023, at 10:00 (UTC), Binance will enable spot trading for three trading pairs: PENDLE/BTC, PENDLE/USDT, and PENDLE/TUSD. Traders can now deposit PENDLE tokens in preparation for trading, and withdrawals for PENDLE will be possible starting from July 4, 2023, at 10:00 (UTC). It&#8217;s worth noting that Binance has waived the listing fee for PENDLE, making it more accessible to users.</p>
<p>To encourage trading activity, Binance has also announced that users will enjoy zero maker fees on the PENDLE/TUSD trading pair until further notice. This means users can actively participate in trading without incurring any fees for adding liquidity to the market. Additionally, Binance will introduce PENDLE as a new borrowable asset with a new margin pair on Isolated Margin. Within 48 hours from July 3, 2023, at 10:00 (UTC), the PENDLE/USDT trading pair will be available for margin trading, allowing users to trade with leverage.</p>
<p>As said, Pendle is a yield-trading protocol that allows the separation of a yield-bearing asset into its principal and yield components. This feature allows users to earn fixed as well as flexible yields on their assets.</p>
<p>PENDLE is the utility token of the Pendle protocol. It also provides liquidity incentives along with fee value accrual, and governance capabilities.</p>
<h2>PENDLE Price Shot Up by 50% after the Announcement by Binance</h2>
<p>Soon after the news of Binance listing Pendle (PENDLE) emerged, the price jumped by 50%. The PENDLE price shot all the way to $1.40</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">After <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Binance?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Binance</a> announced the listing of <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24PENDLE&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$PENDLE</a>, the price of <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24PENDLE&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$PENDLE</a> skyrocketed by more than 50%.</p>
<p>The whale with 3.44M <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24PENDLE&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$PENDLE</a> ($2.56M) is currently in profit of $3.4M (+340%).</p>
<p>Whales always start accumulating very early!<a href="https://t.co/XlEPFQtALX">https://t.co/XlEPFQtALX</a> <a href="https://t.co/rX2v8Hv2MM">pic.twitter.com/rX2v8Hv2MM</a></p>
<p>— Lookonchain (@lookonchain) <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1675757948977684480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 3, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>However, Binance listing alone isn&#8217;t the reason behind the surge in PENDLE price. PENDLE&#8217;s growth throughout this year has been incredible. Starting at a low value of $0.046, it has skyrocketed to $0.76, representing a massive 1,552% increase in its worth. This surge in value cannot be solely attributed to its recent listing. Analyzing the on-chain data provides interesting insights into the factors driving Pendle&#8217;s remarkable performance.</p>
<p>It also appears that large-scale investors, known as whales, played a significant role in the price rise of PENDLE. One particular whale with the address &#8220;0xc54a&#8221; has been consistently purchasing PENDLE from different decentralized and centralized exchanges since February 9. The average buying price for this whale was around $0.2852, resulting in impressive profits of $1.58 million at current prices, indicating a 162% increase.</p>
<p>The significant acquisition of PENDLE by whales demonstrates their belief in the protocol&#8217;s future success. Pendle&#8217;s unique method of yield farming, which allows users to tokenize and trade future yield, has attracted the attention of forward-thinking investors. The protocol&#8217;s innovative Automated Market Maker (AMM) system supports assets with time decay. Thus, it gives users greater control over future yield and creating distinct possibilities for its utilization.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/atm-bitcoin-depot-merger-nasdaq/">Bitcoin ATM Provider Bitcoin Depot Announces Merger Deal Closing, Set to Go Public on Nasdaq</a></p>
<p>Bitcoin Depot, one of the largest operators of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> ATMs in the United States, has announced that it will go public through a merger with GSR II Meteora Acquisition Corporation (GSRM). The two entities will be known as Bitcoin Depot Inc and will be run by the current management team.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Depot, which began operations in 2016, is one of the fastest-growing companies offering multi-cryptocurrency ATM services, giving users more options when buying, selling, or receiving cryptocurrency. It operates over 7,000 ATMs in the United States and Canada, making it the world&#8217;s largest Bitcoin ATM provider. The business aims to make it simple for customers to exchange money for Bitcoin.</p>
<p>On the other hand, GSR II Meteora Acquisition Corporation was created to find and merge with other businesses. It can be referred to as a blank check company because it doesn’t have any specific business plan or goal except to seek a merger.</p>
<p>The agreement, which was first reported in August 2022 and is expected to cost around $885 million, was approved by GSRM shareholders. It will allow investors to buy Bitcoin Depot shares on the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/nasdaq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nasdaq stock exchange</a> starting today, July 3. The ticker symbol BTM will denote it for common stock and BTMWW for public warrants.</p>
<h2>Comments from Bitcoin Depot and GSRM Executives about the Merger</h2>
<p>Through the deal, Bitcoin Depot is expected to grow in popularity and use in North America. Its CEO, Brandon Mintz, believes the deal will bring expansion opportunities. He <a href="https://bitcoindepot.com/bitcoin-depot-and-gsr-ii-meteora-acquisition-corp-announce-closing-of-business-combination/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The closing of the transaction and our listing on Nasdaq is an important milestone and an incredibly proud moment for the entire Bitcoin Depot team.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Co-CEO and Director of GSRM Gus Gracia explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We are excited to complete our business combination with Bitcoin Depot and help support its growth strategy… We believe Bitcoin Depot is poised to continue its momentum to take advantage of the highly fragmented Bitcoin ATM market both domestically and overseas.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Cryptocurrencies and Crypto Solutions Are Gaining Opportunities for Growth</h2>
<p>Despite strict crypto regulations, such as the SEC&#8217;s recent action against <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/sec-sues-binance-securities-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-sec-coinbase-unregistered-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase</a>, investment options in the crypto industry are expanding. Companies are submitting applications to offer Bitcoin ETFs, and the listing of Bitcoin Depot on NASDAQ is a significant step forward.</p>
<p>In terms of future cryptocurrency adoption, it is clear that crypto and its solutions are here to stay, whether regulators like it or not. The introduction and approval of crypto ETFs, companies going public like Bitcoin Depot in this story, the introduction of central bank digital currencies (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBDCs</a>), and the establishment of a working regulated environment for cryptocurrencies all contribute to crypto&#8217;s long-term prospects.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Depot&#8217;s listing on Nasdaq will enhance the company&#8217;s reputation and build trust in its services. It is expected to have a positive impact on the company and benefit the crypto industry as a whole.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/current-state-maang-manatam-stocks/">Exploring Current State of MAANG and MANATAM Stocks</a></p>
<p>The United States stock market has been captivated by the remarkable performance of technology giants, collectively known as the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-are-maang-stocks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MAANG stocks</a>: <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/meta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta Platforms Inc</a> (NASDAQ: META), <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/apple-inc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Inc</a> (NASDAQ: AAPL), <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon.com Inc</a> (NASDAQ: AMZN), <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Netflix Inc</a> (NASDAQ: NFLX), and Google’s parent company <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/alphabet-inc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alphabet Inc</a> (NASDAQ: GOOGL).</p>
<p>These companies have consistently demonstrated their prowess in the industry, driving innovation and generating substantial returns for investors. However, new contenders have emerged, expanding the MAANG acronym to <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/manatam-magnificent-seven-stocks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MANATAM</a>, which includes  <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/microsoft-corporation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft Corp</a> (NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/nvidia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nvidia Corp</a> (NASDAQ: NVDA), Alphabet, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/tesla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tesla Inc</a> (NASDAQ: TSLA), Amazon, and Meta.</p>
<h2>A Reign of Technological Dominance</h2>
<p>Meta previously known as Facebook, has evolved into a metaverse-focused company. By investing heavily in virtual and augmented reality technologies, Meta aims to reshape the way people connect, communicate, and experience digital content.</p>
<p>The company’s <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/meta-shares-best-day-decade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">projected earnings</a> growth is estimated at 24.96%, suggesting that Meta is expected to experience a significant increase in earnings per share, from $11.94 to $14.92.</p>
<p>Apple on the other hand is currently the biggest company in the world in terms of market capitalization. The current stock price of $193.99 <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/global-markets-apple-2023-07-03/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">values</a> the company at $2.84 trillion. Despite the worsening macroeconomic conditions, Apple&#8217;s stock price forecast is highly bullish.</p>
<p>According to recent Apple news, the company launched its Vision Pro AR headset in June 2023. This is the company&#8217;s first completely new hardware release in nearly a decade.</p>
<p>Amazon, with its dominant presence in e-commerce and cloud services, is a formidable force. Revenue for the corporation continues to rise, spurred by greater online purchasing and broad use of Amazon Web Services (AWS). On June 30th, the closing price of Amazon stock on NASDAQ was $130.36. On the same day, the opening price was $129.50, indicating a gain of about 0.66%.</p>
<p>Netflix being the fourth on the MAANG list, has revolutionized the entertainment industry, becoming synonymous with streaming services. According to current data, Netflix’s market capitalization is pegged at $196.01 billion with the current stock closing at $440.09.</p>
<p>As part of Alphabet, Google remains a dominant force in the tech and digital realm. Google&#8217;s search engine and advertising platforms generate substantial revenue, while investments in artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicles position the company for future success. Google Cloud, its cloud services division, is also gaining traction as a significant revenue stream.</p>
<h2>The Emergence of MANATAM</h2>
<p>The inclusion of Nvidia, Tesla, and Microsoft expands the reach of the MAANG stocks, encompassing electric vehicles, Graphic Processing Units (GPUs), and software.</p>
<p>NVIDIA, a pioneer in GPUs and artificial intelligence (AI) technology, has <a href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/NVDA">seen</a> its stock price climb by 159% in 2023. Nvidia&#8217;s technological <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/nvidia-ceo-generative-ai-computing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advancements</a> and strategic partnerships position it as a leader in GPU innovation and drive its continued growth.</p>
<p>With a market capitalization of $830.52 billion, Tesla, an innovative electric vehicle company, has transformed the automobile sector. The company&#8217;s commitment to sustainable transportation, along with its cutting-edge electric vehicle technology has garnered immense popularity among consumers and investors.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Microsoft, a technology industry titan, has proven its tenacity with a 38% increase in stock value this year. On Friday, the closing price of Microsoft stock was pegged at $340.54. Notably, Microsoft&#8217;s <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/microsoft-msft-shares-rise-6-87-microsoft-cloud-services-see-775-spike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entry</a> into cloud computing with Azure has been critical to the company&#8217;s sustained growth. As the demand for cloud solutions intensifies, Microsoft&#8217;s position in MANATAM strengthens.</p>

<p>Singapore&#8217;s cryptocurrency sector is set to undergo significant changes as the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has introduced new measures requiring crypto companies to safeguard customer assets. The move comes as part of ongoing efforts to mitigate risks associated with virtual assets and to ensure the recovery of assets in the event of bankruptcy. According to an <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2023/mas-publishes-investor-protection-measures-for-digital-payment-token-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official announcement</a> on July 3, the financial regulator revealed that crypto service providers would be required to deposit customer funds into a statutory trust by the end of this year.</p>
<p>The new rules aim to enhance investor protection and ensure the safe custody of cryptocurrencies within the country&#8217;s digital asset sector.</p>
<h2>Ban on Staking and Lending Programs for Retail Investors</h2>
<p>Under the new requirements, initiated following a public consultation held in October 2022, MAS has decided to move forward with its proposal to limit the involvement of digital asset providers in lending or staking activities for retail customers.</p>
<p>The consultation comes a few months after the MAS chairman, Tharman Shanmugaratnam, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/mas-restrictions-crypto-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> in July that the authorities are considering implementing a series of rules to restrict retail participation in crypto trading and the use of leverage when transacting in crypto.</p>
<p>As a result of the October consultation, the financial watchdog has now banned crypto companies from offering such services to retail investors. However, the latest legislation is only subject to retail traders, as institutional and accredited investors will still have access to the offerings.</p>
<p>During the consultation process, the regulator received various opinions on the proposal. Some respondents suggested that crypto exchanges should be allowed to offer lending and staking services to retail customers, provided they obtain the customer&#8217;s consent and provide adequate risk disclosures. On the other hand, some respondents advocated for a complete ban on the activities, citing their speculative nature and potential risks.</p>
<p>The MAS&#8217;s decision to introduce these regulatory measures aligns with its goal of balancing protecting retail traders and fostering a favorable environment for institutional investors. The rules take into account industry feedback, including the practical challenges of requiring an independent custodian for customer assets.</p>
<h2>Monetary Authority of Singapore Seeks Public Opinion on New Crypto Rules</h2>
<p>To ensure the effective implementation of the new requirements, the financial regulator of Singapore has opened the draft legislative amendments to public feedback. This feedback will help shape the guidelines governing the country&#8217;s crypto sector and ensure consistent applications across all digital asset service providers.</p>
<p>The financial regulator remains open to monitoring market developments and consumer risk awareness and may consider revising its ban on lending and staking activities for retail customers.</p>

<p>Several industry experts believe that the limits on the total number of Tweet viewership will make it difficult for new CEO Linda Yaccarino, to bring new advertisers to the platform. </p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/twitter-daily-tweet-views-ceo-efforts/">Twitter&#8217;s Latest Decision to Limit Daily Tweet Views Could Undermine CEO&#8217;s Efforts</a></p>
<p>Over the last weekend on July 1, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/twitter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a> introduced a temporary limit on the number of tweets that accounts can see each day. Last Saturday, Twitter boss <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/elon-musk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elon Musk</a> said that unverified users can see as many as 600 tweets daily while Twitter Blue verified users can see 6000 posts.</p>
<p>This is an experiment to address &#8220;extreme levels of data scraping” and “system manipulation&#8221;. Although Musk has revised these limits to a higher number of tweet views, there&#8217;s been some backlash from some users.</p>
<p>Some experts from the marketing industry said that these new limits could undermine efforts by the company’s new Chief Executive <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/linda-yaccarino/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linda Yaccarino</a>, to bring new advertisers to the platform. Yaccarino&#8217;s primary focus has been to mend relationships with advertisers who distanced themselves from the platform following its acquisition by Musk last year, as reported by the Financial Times.</p>
<p>On Sunday, July 2, Mike Proulx, research director said that the limits are “remarkably bad” for users and advertisers. He <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-xl/money/other/analysis-musk-s-twitter-rate-limits-could-undermine-new-ceo-ad-experts-say/ar-AA1dlwdm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">added</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The advertiser trust deficit that Linda Yaccarino needs to reverse just got even bigger. And it cannot be reversed based on her industry credibility alone.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Industry Experts Lash Out on the Daily View Limits of Tweets on Twitter</h2>
<p>Other experts from the marketing industry joined Prolux stating that the current decision could be bad for Yaccarino. Lou Paskalis, who founded a company that provides advice on advertising and used to be in charge of marketing at Bank of America, believes that Yaccarino is Musk&#8217;s final and most promising chance to save Twitter&#8217;s advertising earnings and the overall value of the company.</p>
<p>“This move signals to the marketplace that he’s not capable of empowering her to save him from himself,” he said.</p>
<p>Jasmine Enberg, a principal analyst at Insider Intelligence, expressed concern that limiting user views could have a &#8220;catastrophic&#8221; impact on Twitter&#8217;s advertising business. She mentioned that this move would make it even more challenging to convince advertisers to come back to the platform, which is already a difficult task.</p>
<p>Previously, Elon Musk criticized artificial intelligence platform firms like OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, for using Twitter data to build their large language models (LLMs). According to Kai-Cheng Yang, a researcher at Indiana University in Bloomington, the imposed limits on Twitter seem to be successful in preventing third parties, such as search engines, from easily scraping Twitter data as they did in the past. Yang mentioned that while it might still be possible, it would require more advanced and less efficient methods.</p>
