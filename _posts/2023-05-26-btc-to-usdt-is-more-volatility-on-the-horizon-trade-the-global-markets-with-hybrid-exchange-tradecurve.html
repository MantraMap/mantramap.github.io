<p>Bitcoin's Halving: What You Need to Know</p>
<p>BTC-USD is the most widely traded cryptocurrency pair in the world. Since its introduction in 2009, BTC has experienced several cycles that have shaped its price and value. One of the most significant events is the halving, which occurs approximately every 4 years or every 210,000 blocks created. The next halving is expected to take place around April 2024. During the halving, the mining rate decreases from 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125 BTC per block.</p>
<p>The halving is a major event because it reduces the rate at which new Bitcoins are introduced into circulation. With a fixed supply of 21 million coins, reducing the supply of new coins through the halving can increase the scarcity and value of Bitcoin over time.</p>
<p>Bitcoin mining involves powerful computers competing to solve complex mathematical problems and add new blocks to the blockchain. The halving cuts these rewards in half, which means miners have to work twice as hard to earn the same amount of BTC.</p>
<p>If history is any indication, the halving is a bullish event for BTC, and Bitcoin holders can expect significant volatility after the next halving in April 2024.</p>
