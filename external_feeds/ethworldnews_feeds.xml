<ul><li>Polygon co-founder Mihailo Bjelic unveiled a new Polygon improvement proposal earlier today.&nbsp;</li><li>The proposal seeks to upgrade Polygon‚Äôs proof of stake chain to zkEVM Validium.</li><li>The proposal addresses several concerns, including security, gas spike issues, and reorg issues.&nbsp;</li><li>If approved, the zk compatibility would bring scalability, faster transactions, and greater decentralization to the network.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Polygon co-founder Mihailo Bjelic has proposed a major upgrade to the network‚Äôs proof of stake (PoS) architecture. The proposal seeks to upgrade the PoS chain to a zkEVM Validium. <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/polygon-supports-franklin-templeton-fund/">Polygon</a>, whose zk rollup went live earlier this year, would still be compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine as per the latest proposal.¬†</p>



<h2><strong>MATIC Would Remain Polygon‚Äôs Native Staking Token</strong></h2>



<p>According to the pre-Polygon Improvement Proposal (PIP) <a href="https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pre-pip-discussion-upgrading-polygon-pos-to-a-zkevm-validium/12187" rel="nofollow noopener">discussion</a> started by Mihailo Bjelic on the network‚Äôs governance forum, the proposed upgrade to a zkEVM validium would address the network‚Äôs current problems including the security issues, its reliance on Cosmos SDK and Geth, and gas spikes as well as reorg issues.¬†The proposal added that MATIC would continue to serve as Polygon&#8217;s staking token. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/ Today a proposal was published to upgrade Polygon PoS to a zkEVM validium, a first-of-its-kind, decentralized ZK Layer 2.<br><br>As a zkEVM validium, Polygon PoS would inherit Ethereum&#39;s unmatched security, while preserving low fees &amp; high scalability.<br><br>üëâüèΩ <a href="https://t.co/5fsMOqLqRy" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/5fsMOqLqRy</a> <a href="https://t.co/9r9VILxdvu" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/9r9VILxdvu</a></p>&mdash; Polygon (Labs) (@0xPolygonLabs) <a href="https://twitter.com/0xPolygonLabs/status/1671208777784209441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">June 20, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>zkEVM Validium has been presented as a viable, beneficial, and straightforward solution for Polygon‚Äôs ongoing issues. Direct benefits of the upgrade would include increased security by leveraging Ethereum&#8217;s high security, and future-proof tech stack rather than legacy blockchain architecture. If approved the proposal would also eliminate reorgs, speed up transaction confirmations, increase stability and fee estimation, and bring greater decentralization while making it compatible with Polygon 2.0.¬†</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>‚ÄúUpgraded Polygon PoS (zkEVM validium) would offer very high scalability and very low fees, with the tradeoff of storing transaction data locally instead of on Ethereum. It would be a great fit for applications that have high transaction volume and require low transaction fees, e.g. Web3 gaming and social.‚Äù </p><cite>Mihailo Bjelic, co-founder, Polygon</cite></blockquote>



<p>As per the timeline laid out in accordance with the governance process, the pre-PIP discussion and consensus are expected to be done before the end of July 2023. PIP publishing, discussion, and consensus would take place between October as well as November 2023. That would be followed by PIP implantation and testing between November and January 2024. Lastly, the upgrade and PIP activation on the mainnet would take place between February 2024 and March 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Crypto exchange Gemini has selected Singapore to serve as the hub for its operations in the Asia Pacific region.&nbsp;</li><li>The Winklevoss-owned exchange plans to hire more than 100 employees for its Singapore office.&nbsp;</li><li>The crypto exchange is also growing its engineering base in India and plans to hire key employees for the Gurgaon office.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Gemini Trust Company has announced its expansion plans for the Asia Pacific region, with Singapore to serve as its hub for APAC operations. The announcement comes just days after the crypto exchange‚Äôs announcement comes just days after its leadership team visited the region as part of their efforts dedicated to global expansion. The crypto exchange has identified APAC as a ‚Äúgreat driver‚Äù of the next wave of growth for crypto and Gemini.</p>



<h2><strong>Gemini To Expand Engineering Operations In India</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-announces-expansion-plans-in-apac" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a> by Gemini earlier today, the crypto exchange plans to increase its headcount in Singapore by hiring more than 100 employees over the next 12 months. The exchange‚Äôs history with the country dates back to 2020 when it launched support for the Singapore Dollar (GSD) in order to provide Singapore residents with seamless access to the crypto market.¬†</p>



<p>In addition to the Singapore hub, Gemini is also expanding its engineering operations in <a href="https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-to-expand-global-engineering-and-operations-teams-with-new-india-office" rel="nofollow noopener">India</a> with an office in the city of Gurgaon which will serve as the second largest engineering hub behind the United States. The Winklevoss-owned exchange is actively hiring software engineers and technical product managers for its Gurgaon office as well.¬†</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Our engineering, design, and operations teams in India will make significant contributions to the development of our next-generation web and mobile user experiences core platform fundamentals in the area of compliance, data pipelines and warehousing‚Ä¶.‚Äù </p><cite>Pravjit Tiwana, Gemini‚Äôs Global CTO and CEO of Asia Pacific</cite></blockquote>



<p>Gemini‚Äôs latest developments in the Asia Pacific region are the result of a broader push for global expansion amid a rising crackdown in the United States. Last month, the crypto exchange <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/gemini-european-headquarters-ireland/">announced</a> Ireland as its hub to manage operations in Europe.¬†</p>

<ul><li>A crypto exchange backed by TradFi giants like Citadel and Fidelity has started operations.&nbsp;</li><li>EDX Markets announced the launch of its digital asset market and the completion of an investment round earlier today.&nbsp;</li><li>The crypto exchange currently offers several mainstream cryptocurrencies including BTC, ETH, and LTC.&nbsp;</li><li>The exchange will only cater to institutional clients and will use a third party for crypto custody.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>EDX Markets has kicked off operations following an investment round earlier today that added new equity partners. The new investors joined a coalition of founding investors, including traditional finance giants like Charles Schwab, Citadel Securities, Fidelity Digital Assets, and Sequoia Capital. The crypto exchange went live more than nine months after it was unveiled in September last year.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>EDX Markets Will Not Serve Retail Customers</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230620110605/en/Digital-Asset-Platform-EDX-Markets-Begins-Trading-and-Completes-New-Funding-Round" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> by EDX Markets earlier today, the crypto exchange presented itself as a digital asset marketplace designed to enable safe and compliant trading of digital assets through trusted intermediaries. The exchange also concluded an investment round that added strategic investors, including DV Crypto, GTS, GSR Markets, and Miami International Holdings, which recently acquired <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftxs-ledgerx-acquired-by-m7-holdings/">LedgerX</a> from FTX.¬†</p>



<p>EDX will not cater to retail crypto customers. The new exchange will allow institutional investors to trade top cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). While not offering services to retail investors directly, the exchange reportedly expects retail brokerages to send investors‚Äô orders to buy and sell crypto products to its marketplace. The exchange will use a third-party custodian to handle its clients‚Äô digital assets.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>‚ÄúEDX‚Äôs ability to attract new investors and partners in the face of sector headwinds demonstrates the strength of our platform and the demand for a safe and compliant cryptocurrency market. We are committed to bringing the best of traditional finance to cryptocurrency markets, with an infrastructure built by market experts to embed key institutional best practices.‚Äù </p><cite>Jamil Nazarali, CEO of EDX Markets</cite></blockquote>



<p>EDX also announced that it would launch a new clearinghouse business later this year to make its investors‚Äô settlement princess more efficient. EDX Clearing will settle trades matched on the crypto marketplace and facilitate trades against a central counterparty.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>A Montenegro Court sentenced TerraUSD creator Do Kwon to four months in jail for forging travel papers. </li><li>The Terraform Labs founder was set to remain in Montenegrin custody till next year as authorities consider extradition requests from South Korea and the U.S.</li><li>South Korean investigators could seek a 40-year sentence for Do Kwon after his company&#8217;s multi-billion collapse last summer. </li></ul>



<p>Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon was found guilty of forging travel documents and sentenced to four months in jail by a Montenegro court, <a href="https://sudovi.me/ospg/sadrzaj/D264" data-type="URL" data-id="https://sudovi.me/ospg/sadrzaj/D264" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reports</a> said on Monday. Kwon pleaded &#8220;Not  guilty&#8221; last Friday to the charges.</p>



<p>The fugitive Kwon was arrested in March by Montenegrin law enforcement in Podgorica, the country&#8217;s capital city. Authorities detained the former crypto tycoon as he was about to board a private plane bound for Dubai. Kwon was arrested together with Han Chang-Joon, a former CFO and executive at Terra. </p>



<p>Both suspects were initially granted bail before a High Court annulled the decision. Bail was again <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwon-granted-400k-bail-montenegro/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwon-granted-400k-bail-montenegro/" rel="noreferrer noopener">granted</a> by the Basic Court prior to today&#8217;s ruling. Furthermore, it was previously determined by a Montenegrin court that Do Kwon would remain in detention for six month while authorities assess extradition requests from South Korea and the U.S. </p>



<h2>Do Kwon&#8217;s Legal Woes </h2>



<p>The ruling on June 19 is the first against Do Kwon since his company Terraform Labs collapsed in May 2022 and wiped out billions in investments. Estimates say that the Terra&#8217;s crash, premeditated by the collapse of TerraLUNA (now LUNA Classic or LUNC) and the algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (UST), amounted to over $40 billion in drown investments from retail and institutional players. </p>



<p>Indeed, the collapse unleashed a domino effect that saw companies like Three Arrows Capital, Voyager, and BlockFi fall to ruin. </p>



<p>Since then Do Kwon has evaded law enforcement despite claiming to not be on the run. South Korean investigators claim that Do Kwon&#8217;s violations of the country&#8217;s Capital Markets Acts makes the jurisdiction the perfect place for his trial. Kwon could spend as much as 40 years in prison if <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwon-sentence-40-year-south-korea-jail/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwon-sentence-40-year-south-korea-jail/" rel="noreferrer noopener">convicted</a> in his home country. </p>



<p>Elsewhere, U.S authorities also want to prosecute Do Kwon as the Securities and Exchange Commission already filed charges against the former Terra CEO. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Ethereum Foundation researcher Michael Neuder proposed increasing the validator balance cap from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH.</li><li>The idea being considered within the developer community would stem the growing active validator set size and optimize network efficiency.</li><li>Increasing the limits of validator balances would also make room for auto-compounding of rewards, allowing validators to earn maximum yield for their staked coins.</li></ul>



<p>Following a <a href="https://twitter.com/christine_dkim/status/1669740046256312320?s=46&amp;t=pA66xOVb6aHMw-v_CxFceA" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/christine_dkim/status/1669740046256312320?s=46&amp;t=pA66xOVb6aHMw-v_CxFceA" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">proposal</a> from Ethereum Foundation researcher Michael Neuder, core developers of crypto‚Äôs largest altcoin network could increase the validator balance cap from the 32 ETH limit to a staggering 2,048 ETH if the idea garners support.</p>



<p>Neuder shared the proposal during the developer&#8217;s bi-weekly call where client teams meet to discuss and coordinate the most important updates to the network. The increase in validator balance seems to address a major concern &#8211; the growing number of validators on Ethereum&#8217;s PoS network.</p>



<p>Indeed, the current 32 ETH limit means that entities must run multiple validators if they wish to stake past the limit and access more staking rewards. The balance limit has so far spurred an increase in <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ethereum-validators-500000-post-merge/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ethereum-validators-500000-post-merge/" rel="noreferrer noopener">validators which currently exceeds half a million</a>, a rapid increase since The Merge.</p>



<p>According to Neuder‚Äôs proposal, increasing the balance limit will push Ethereum toward greater efficiency by optimizing finality in a single block.</p>



<p>While the current balance cap buoys decentralization, it also causes entities to operate a concerning number of validators which could adversely impact network efficiency, Neuder argued during Friday‚Äôs developer&#8217;s call.</p>



<h2>More Ethereum Rewards For Validators</h2>



<p>Furthermore, Neuder‚Äôs proposal could unlock greater rewards for <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/2billion-ethereum-rewards-unlock-shapella/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/2billion-ethereum-rewards-unlock-shapella/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum validators</a> since they would be able to stake more and therefore, earn more yield on their staked tokens.</p>



<p>Currently, the 32 ETH limit does not allow validators to earn rewards beyond their capped balances. This limit propels operational costs for larger node operators who end up managing hundreds or thousands of validators in a bid to maximize their yield generation.</p>



<p>If the cap is increased, Neuder argued that an auto-compounding feature could allow for fewer Ethereum validators to exist while accessing greater rewards through auto-compounding of their staked yield.</p>



<p>The researcher warned that the idea is not without risk and developers will continue to weigh the merits alongside other hot-button upgrades mulled in the upcoming Deneb and Cancun.</p>



<p>Deneb which focuses on changes to the consensus layer should roll out based on three EIPs. EIP 7044 introduces a code change that accepts signed validator exits in perpetuity, thus bettering the shaking experience.</p>



<p>Another staking experience upgrade, EIP 4788, aims to improve access to Beacon chain blocks with information on the chain state inside EVMs. EIP 7045 focuses on improved security by expanding the attestation slot from a rolling window of one epoch to two epochs.</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Binance is under investigation in France for offering illegal digital asset services and aggravated money laundering, Le Monde reported. </li><li>The platform announced its exit from the Netherlands on Friday after failing to obtain a license and meet up with AML regulations.</li><li>Binance recently shut down its business in Cyprus as part of plans to comply with the newly signed EU MiCA policies.</li><li>The crypto exchange is under heavy scrutiny from the U.S. SEC for allegedly operating an unregistered securities exchange and offering illegal securities trading to American investors.</li></ul>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2023/06/16/binance-principale-plate-forme-mondiale-d-echange-de-cryptomonnaies-visee-par-une-enquete-en-france_6177876_4408996.html" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2023/06/16/binance-principale-plate-forme-mondiale-d-echange-de-cryptomonnaies-visee-par-une-enquete-en-france_6177876_4408996.html" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Le Monde</a> citing word from the Paris public prosecutors office, Binance is under investigation for illegally providing French investors with digital asset trading facilities and also supporting ‚Äúacts of aggravated money laundering‚Äù.¬†</p>



<p>French authorities allege that the company offered these services to French customers through its local division and regulators have been investigating suspicions since February 2022.  The local publication reported that documents and records seized will be analyzed for evidence as regulators build their case against crypto‚Äôs largest centralized exchange.¬†</p>



<p>In other related news, the crypto exchange is <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1669628787267624961?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1669628787267624961?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">pulling out of the Dutch market</a> after failing to secure a crypto license and comply with the Netherlands‚Äô anti-money laundering (AML) policies.¬†</p>



<p>Binance‚Äôs exit from the Netherlands comes shortly after the company announced plans to shut down its division in Cyprus. This decision was reportedly taken as a strategic move to comply with MiCA, the landmark crypto rule recently <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/mica-officially-signed-eu-policymakers/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/mica-officially-signed-eu-policymakers/" rel="noreferrer noopener">signed</a> into law by EU policymakers.</p>



<h2>Binance Vs SEC</h2>



<p>Friday‚Äôs developments about exiting the Dutch markets and investigations in France have emerged amid intense regulatory scrutiny in America.¬†</p>



<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Binance and CEO Changpeng Zhao for breaking securities law, commingling customers&#8217; funds in a private entity, and denying investors of proper protection through necessary disclosure.¬†</p>



<p>Binance US, the company‚Äôs American affiliate, has seen its market share shrink to 1% following the news, per Kaiko data. The U.S. trading arm also announced staff cuts as it prepares for a lengthy and expensive litigation process with the SEC.¬†</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>BlackRock, Bank of America, and Fidelity have all massively increased their holdings of MicroStrategy stock, Bitcoin‚Äôs largest corporate holder.</li><li>Buying MSTR seems to be a path to BTC exposure rather than directly buying crypto‚Äôs top coin.</li><li>Canada‚Äôs sixth largest bank has also spent a considerable amount buying MicroStrategy stock in 2023.</li><li>The appetite for MSTR shares comes at a time when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is cracking down on crypto activity in America.</li></ul>



<p>Major banks and Financial Institutions in the U.S. seem to be increasing their exposure to Bitcoin by accumulating massive positions of MicroStrategy shares, the same company that is currently the largest corporate holder of BTC with coffers worth over $3 billion at current prices.</p>



<p>Three giants in particular &#8211; BlackRock, Bank of America, and Fidelity have spent a combined $200+ million buying MicroStrategy‚Äôs MSTR. </p>



<p>Bank of America, the 2nd largest bank in the U.S. worth over $200 billion and with over $3 trillion in assets under management (AUM), spent $59.5 million solidifying its 2.3% stake in Michael Saylor‚Äôs company.</p>



<p>Fidelity with its $4.5 trillion AUM portfolio splurged over $25 million securing a 1% stake in MSTR while Canada‚Äôs sixth largest financial house, The National Bank of Canada spent over half a million dollars buying MicroStrategy shares this year.</p>



<p>Perhaps the most eye-catching MSTR buyer with over $150 million worth of shares is the world‚Äôs largest asset manager with $10 trillion in AUM &#8211; BlackRock.¬†BlackRock boasts a massive 6% stake in MicroStrategy. Coincidentally, or perhaps not, recent reports from <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/06/15/blackrock-close-to-filing-bitcoin-etf-source/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/06/15/blackrock-close-to-filing-bitcoin-etf-source/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CoinDesk</a> say that BlackRock plans to file a Bitcoin ETF.</p>



<p>Notably, the U.S. SEC has historically denied Bitcoin ETF applications previously submitted by companies like Grayscale. It‚Äôs unclear if BlackRock might succeed where others have failed.</p>

<h2>MSTR Offers Bitcoin Exposure¬†</h2>



<p>It‚Äôs possible that U.S. banking and financial giants are aping in on MSTR stock since the company holds Bitcoin, and thus, offers exposure to crypto‚Äôs leading coin by market cap.¬†Indeed, Michael Saylor‚Äôs MicroStrategy is the <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/microstrategy-bitcoin-29-million-btc-buy/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/microstrategy-bitcoin-29-million-btc-buy/" rel="noreferrer noopener">largest corporate holder of Bitcoin</a> at press time with over 140,000 BTC worth more than $3 billion at today‚Äôs prices.¬†</p>



<p>Apart from leading the crypto industry as the top coin by market cap, Bitcoin sits on a short list of digital assets not considered an unregistered security by the SEC.¬†</p>



<p>Analysis and predictions from several stakeholders, including the $700 billion-strong Standard Chartered agree that BTC will leap in value by 2024. This possibly makes BTC an alluring investment for America‚Äôs biggest institutions with MSTR offering a regulated way for these banks to hold Bitcoin.</p>



<p>Bitcoin traded around $25,000 on Thursday after falling in price amid a broader crypto market downturn that followed the SEC&#8217;s <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-sues-coinbase-after-binance/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-sues-coinbase-after-binance/" rel="noreferrer noopener">enforcement actions against Binance and Coinbase</a>. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>On Thursday, Crypto‚Äôs largest stablecoin USDT from Tether slightly depegged as a token imbalance rocked Curve‚Äôs popular 3pool.</li><li>Tether balances on Curve‚Äôs stablecoin pool peaked at 76% at press time as traders sold millions of USDT for DAI and USDC.</li><li>‚ÄúWe are ready to redeem any amount‚Äù CTO Paolo Ardoino tweeted saying that edgy markets make easy prey for attackers.</li></ul>



<p>Stablecoin balances on Curve‚Äôs 3pool show that traders are opting out of Tether‚Äôs USDT as crypto‚Äôs largest stablecoin by a wide margin depegged during trading hours on Thursday.¬†</p>



<p>Analysis from on-chain insight outfit Peckshield showed that USDT made up over 76% of 3pool, a stablecoin pool offered by Curve Finance that features USDT, Maker‚Äôs DAI, and Circle‚Äôs USDC.¬†</p>



<p>The sharp balance change means that traders are swapping millions of USDT for DAI and USDC amid the slight depeg. The development could also provide an opportunity for arbitrage traders looking to profit from another depeg event in the crypto market.¬†</p>



<p>Curve‚Äôs 3pool showed USDT balances of over $315 million while DAI and USDC balances slipped below $50 million as traders seemingly dumped their Tether.¬†A similar pattern was observed last summer during Terra‚Äôs meteoric collapse and again when Sam Bankman-Fried‚Äôs FTX crypto exchange ran into bankruptcy.</p>

<p>At press time, USDT&#8217;s depeg had recovered back to $0.9975. USDT‚Äôs market cap was above $83 billion on Thursday, by far the largest stablecoin market cap in crypto per CMC data.</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The hackers suspected to be North Korea‚Äôs Lazarus group moved stolen funds from Atomic Wallet through Garantex, Elliptic reported.</li><li>Atomic Wallet was hacked of several cryptos including BTC, ETH, USDT, DOGE, LTC, BNB, and MATIC to the tune of $35 million.</li><li>Lazarus hackers swapped a portion of the stolen funds to BTC using 1inch and Garantex before laundering the assets through crypto tumbler Sinbad.</li></ul>



<p>The hackers behind this month‚Äôs $35 million attack on crypto wallet Atomic Wallet <a href="https://twitter.com/elliptic/status/1668357982248206339?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/elliptic/status/1668357982248206339?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">moved</a> some of the stolen funds to Garantex, a crypto exchange sanctioned by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).</p>



<h2>Atomic Wallet Hacked, $35 Million In Bitcoin And Cryptos Stolen</h2>



<p>On June 3, hackers believed to be part of the notorious North Korean cyberterrorist group Lazarus stole several crypto assets from Atomic Wallet. The stolen assets including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Tether (USDT), BNB, Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin (LTC), and Polygon (MATIC) were worth around $35 million.</p>



<p>The wallet provider said the attack affected less than 1% of its monthly active users and investigations were ongoing to identify the exploit vector.¬†</p>



<p>Lazarus hackers leveraged decentralized trading service 1inch before sending the stolen assets to OFAC-sanctioned Garantex. The exchange which still operates today was blacklisted by the OFAC for its loose anti-money laundering systems in 2022.</p>



<p>According to Elliptic researchers, the hackers used Garantex to swap the funds for BTC and then sent the assets to crypto tumbler Sinbad for laundering.¬†The hackers were forced to take this route after <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bitrue-hackers-steal-23-million-eth/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bitrue-hackers-steal-23-million-eth/" rel="noreferrer noopener">crypto exchanges</a> froze addresses tied to the Atomic Wallet hack thanks to a ‚Äúcross-community effort‚Äù.</p>



<h2>Atomic Wallet Exploiter Locks ETH In Non-Withdrawable Contracts</h2>



<p>In a bizarre move, the Atomic Wallet exploiter created 0x/null contracts and deposited ETH worth around $40,000 at current prices. The reason behind the move is unclear as it is impossible to withdraw funds from these 0x/null smart contracts.

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The investment provider will delist four cryptocurrencies for U.S. customers in response to the SEC‚Äôs lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase.</li><li>Customers will not have the option to open new ALGO, MANA, DASH, and MATIC positions from July 12.</li><li>Users can still hold and sell their positions until further notice.</li><li>eToro cited ‚Äúrecent developments&#8221; as the reason following securities claims in filing against the two major cryptocurrency exchanges.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement actions against crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase continue to reverberate throughout the industry as investment platform eToro <a href="https://twitter.com/eToroUS/status/1668323758199955456?s=20" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/eToroUS/status/1668323758199955456?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">plans to delist four digital assets</a> that are allegedly unregistered securities. </p>



<p>eToro is a cryptocurrency exchange and an online brokerage platform with a limited range of equities and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that allows users to trade 30+ cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>eToro And Robinhood Move Quick After SEC Lawsuits</h2>



<p>On Monday, eToro told users that it will delist four cryptocurrencies &#8211; Algorand&#8217;s ALGO, Decentraland&#8217;s MANA, Dash (DASH), and Polygon (MATIC). The change in eToro&#8217;s crypto offering will only affect U.S. customers and will take effect from July 12. </p>



<p>eToro will allow its U.S. customers to hold and sell their positions in these four tokens post-July 12 but users cannot open new positions, per Monday&#8217;s announcement. The platform cited ‚Äúrecent developments&#8221; as the reason following the SEC&#8217;s litigation against two major crypto exchanges &#8211; Binance and Coinbase.</p>



<p>The decision from eToro follows Robinhood&#8217;s move to <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/robinhood-delist-ada-matic-sol-sec/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/robinhood-delist-ada-matic-sol-sec/" rel="noreferrer noopener">delist three tokens also classified as securities</a> &#8211; Solana&#8217;s SOL, Cardano&#8217;s ADA, and Polygon&#8217;s MATIC. </p>



<h2>Altcoins In Hot Water</h2>



<p>Prices across the crypto ecosystem slumped last week after the SEC unleashed allegations against <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-sues-coinbase-after-binance/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-sues-coinbase-after-binance/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance and Coinbase</a> claiming that both platforms broke U.S. laws. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao was also <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-changpeng-zhao-summoned-dc-court/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-changpeng-zhao-summoned-dc-court/" rel="noreferrer noopener">included</a> in the watchdog&#8217;s lawsuit for supposedly commingling funds into a private entity identified as Merit Peak. </p>



<p>The altcoins listed by Gary Gensler&#8217;s watchdog boast a combined market cap of over $100 billion, creating further uncertainty about the future of these tokens in the U.S.</p>



<p>Notably, crypto proponents are pushing back against the commission&#8217;s claims and insisting that the regulator has failed in its duty to provide clear guidance for the nascent industry. </p>
