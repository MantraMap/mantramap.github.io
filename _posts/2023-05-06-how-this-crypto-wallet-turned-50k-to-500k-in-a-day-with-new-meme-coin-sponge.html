One trader bought new meme coin $SPONGE on Uniswap and made a 10x return on investment within a little over 24 hours. <br />
SpongeBob (SPONGE) was listed on May 4th, opening at $0.00002749 and reaching $0.0006533 shortly after, its current all-time high. <br />
While he didn't capture the entire move, one early investor bought 972 million SPONGE for 31.5 Ether, worth just over $50,000 at the time. <br />
