<li>The Lima upgrade is the 12<sup>th</sup> upgrade on the Tezos protocol.</li>
<li>Tezos is referred to as the &ldquo;self-amending blockchain&rdquo; for its ability to seamlessly upgrade using its on-chain governance.</li>
<li>Lima upgrade reduces the risk of bugs in smart contracts among other benefits.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://coinjournal.net/tezos/what-is-tezos/">Tezos</a>, one of the original <a href="https://coinjournal.net/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos/">Proof-of-Stake (PoS)</a> blockchains, has activated its 12<sup>th</sup> upgrade, the Lima upgrade, which was voted upon and approved by the Tezos community. The new upgrade which introduces several new features also reduces the risk of bugs in smart contracts.</p>
<p>Lima marks the fourth protocol upgrade in 2022 and the 12<sup>th</sup> upgrade since the Tezos protocol was unveiled. Tezos is known for its ability to seamlessly upgrade through its on-chain governances which allows the protocol participants to propose and vote on upgrades and changes that they believe are important for the protocol.</p>
<h2>Key improvements introduced by Lima upgrade</h2>
<p>The Lima upgrade introduces several key improvements to Tezos functionality including faster processing speeds, the introduction of consensus keys, and improvements to tickets.</p>
<p>The Lima upgrade continues with the &lsquo;Pipelining validation project&rsquo; that speeds up the processing of blocks and operations on Tezos by separating validation processes from application processes. A new block on Tezos is first validated before being forwarded to other peers; a feature that speeds up block propagation on the network and reduces the block time to 15 seconds and increases the overall throughput for the blockchain.</p>
<p>The consensus keys will allow validators (known as bakers in Tezos) to designate a special key for signing blocks and consensus operations. This feature prevents backers from losing delegators due to a change in setup or the need to coordinate with delegators <a href="https://coinjournal.net/glossary/off-chain/">off-chain</a> to move them to a new address.</p>
<p>Tickets are a type of data unique to Tezos smart contracts and a great foundation for the scalable solutions that have allowed for many use cases including tokenization, authentication, and voting among others. Lima upgrade in particular deprecates the creation, storage and transfer of zero-amount tickets thus reducing the risk of bugs in smart contracts.</p>
<p>In addition to the improvements to the current Layer 1 Tezos solutions, the Lima upgrade also finalizes the development work towards Smart Rollups, which is an innovative Layer 2 scaling solution that is expected to debut in the subsequent Tezos upgrade proposal.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin price has moved sideways in the past few weeks.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The Federal Reserve sounded more hawkish than expects.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">It has formed a rising wedge pattern.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/what-is-bitcoin/"><u>Bitcoin</u></a> price continued recoiling on Monday as investors remained concerned about monetary policy and the crypto industry. The BTC coin was trading at $16,750, where it has been in the past few days. This price is a few points below last week&rsquo;s high of $16,867.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Bitcoin price prediction: no Santa rally?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The BTC/USD price has continued consolidating in the past few weeks. After staging a comeback last week, the pair suffered a pullback as investors reflected on the latest Federal Reserve interest rate decision.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In its decision last week, the Fed decided to hike interest rates by 0.50% in its final decision of the year. It had previously increased rates by 75 basis points in the previous four monetary policy meeting. Also, the bank decided to continue with it quantitative tightening policy, as we wrote <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/bitcoin-retreats-below-18k-as-fed-raises-interest-rate-to-a-15-year-high/"><u>here</u></a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The most important change was that the Fed would continue hiking rates in the coming months. That statement helped the market to change its view about monetary policy. Before the meeting, analysts were expecting that the central bank to sound a bit dovish since inflation has started cooling.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After the decision, American and global stocks collapsed while bond yields rose to their highest level in a few week. The US dollar index, which was recently falling, has made a strong recovery in the past few days.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The other main reason why Bitcoin price has been recoiling is the rising outflows from most exchanges. Binance, the biggest exchange in the world, has seen its outflows rise to more than $7.5 billion in the past 7 days. In the same period, Bitfinex has seen over $335 million in outflows while Crypto.com lost over $76 million.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Therefore, all these actions mean that the Santa rally has not happened.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Bitcoin price forecast</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2022/11/19/1671450377573-ab2cf34d-9533-46a2-8688-dbeced009a33.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="286" height="318"></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/?exchange=COINBASE"><u>BTC/USD chart by TradingView</u></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">So, is it safe to <a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/buy/"><u>buy Bitcoin</u></a>? The BTC price has been in a tight range in the past few days. In this period, it has remained below the important resistance level at $16,867. It is also consolidating at the 25-day and 50-day moving averages.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">At the same time, the Reltive Strength Index (RSI) has formed a bullish divergence pattern, which is a bullish sign. It has also formed a rising wedge, which is usually a bearish sign. Therefore, there is a likelihood that the coin will have a bearish breakout. If this happens, it could drop to $15,000.</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">ApeCoin has lost the battle at the resistance of $4.2</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency has been hit by the general weak crypto sentiment</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">APE could drop to $3 if the bear pressure mounts</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">ApeCoin (APE/USD) traded at $3.5 as the cryptocurrency came under bear pressure from the $4.2 resistance. Buyers have been defending the $4.2 resistance for some time, giving hopes of a potential breakout and the start of a bull market. Apes seem to have now been defeated as the cryptocurrency looks at a possible decline to $3.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Recent strengths in ApeCoin coincided with the launch of the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/glossary/staking/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>staking</u></a> feature earlier this month. Despite witnessing a lot of success, the users of the staking service have been warned of numerous phishing attacks. Horizen Lab, the developer of the staking feature, has told users to only use the official link,<em>&nbsp;ApeStake.io,</em> for the service.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Nonetheless, from the price outlook, APE seems to be getting hit by the overall crypto sentiment. The decline comes despite Ape-coin-linked NFTs continuing to record leading sales volumes. A technical outlook shows APE still trapped in a descending channel.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>APE slides from $4.2 resistance as weakness develop</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2022/11/20/1671570146723-d0f47cbd-cfbd-48b5-afc2-3246bee8baf4.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="286"></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/APEUSD/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>APE/USD Chart by TradingView</u></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">APE initiated a bearish MACD crossover on the daily chart. The indicator has shifted to the negative territory after the latest price decline.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency now trades below $4.2 resistance after bears took control. APE price has now crashed back to the descending channel. The price is gaining stability at $3.5, but the established support lies at $3.0.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Concluding thoughts&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">If bulls do not take control of APE at $3.5, the next decline could take the cryptocurrency to $3.0.&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/apecoin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>APE price</u></a> must overcome resistance at $4.2 and the descending channel to become bullish.</p>

<p dir="ltr">SOL trades at $12 with weak momentum</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency is weighed by weak market fundamentals</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">SOL could consolidate further before pushing higher or lower</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Solana (SOL/USD) trades with dwindling volumes at $12. For another time, the cryptocurrency faces bear pressure at the now-developed support zone. Bulls have successfully defended the level in the past, and it remains to be seen whether they will for another time. The latest&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cryptocurrency news</u></a> has been unforgiving for SOL.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">A myriad of factors has been against Solana price this year. Aside from the macro factors and weak crypto sentiment, Solana has suffered at the hands of hackers. Less than a week ago, Solana-based DEX Raydium lost $2.2 million. The exploit on December 16 has been responsible for much of the weakness of SOL currently. The hacks have been many this year, hitting the native token.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But there is some good news you could want to hear about Solana. According to crypto analytics firm Nansen, Solana competed successfully with Ethereum before the FTX saga. Nansen says in the three months to October, the daily transactions on Solana rarely fell below 200 million. The analytics firm pointed out that the active addresses on the network were between 600,000 to 1.1 million during the period.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The activity underlined that Solana was catching up with its proclaimed Ethereum killer status. The collapse of FTX brought a new twist, taking the price significantly lower. SOL investors are still reeling from the aftermath.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>SOL trades with weak momentum at the $12 support</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2022/11/20/1671569661495-334bebee-76de-4f53-8906-b29ba602d976.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="287"></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SOLUSD/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>SOL/USD Chart by TradingView</u></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">From the daily chart, the MACD indicator shows a weak and bearish momentum for SOL. Trading volumes on both the buy and sell sides are weak for the cryptocurrency. SOL is currently held at the $12 support.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>What next for SOL?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/solana/#:~:text=One%20Solana%20is%20currently%20worth,02%3A00%20GMT%2D8." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>SOL price</u></a> could continue consolidating at the $12 support until it gathers more liquidity. Based on the fundamental developments, a break higher or lower could occur. Should bears increase, SOL could fall to or below $10.</p>

<p dir="ltr">DOGE has lost by double digits in the past week.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency has been weighed by limited fundamentals around its use on Twitter.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">DOGE faces further lows if it crashes below the 200-day MA.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/dogecoin/what-is-dogecoin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Dogecoin</u></a> (DOGE/USD) is again fighting off the onslaught of bears. With a weekly loss of 17%, the meme cryptocurrency is the biggest loser among its peers. Perhaps to underline DOGE&rsquo;s status as a meme coin, the cryptocurrency has been labelled a &ldquo;giant con&rdquo; by CNBC&rsquo;s Jim Cramer. It is easy to see why the decline has been immense for DOGE. Positive fundamentals have been hard to come by, and investors&rsquo; enthusiasm around DOGE&rsquo;s use on Twitter has subsided.</p>
<p dir="ltr">DOGE fans could be a little disappointed as Elon Musk sends mixed signals around Twitter. The billionaire investor asked his followers if to step down as Twitter CEO. An overwhelming majority of 58% voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; supporting the proposal.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As you already know, DOGE has been earning support from Musk&rsquo;s comments and views. His latest tweet does not augur well with DOGE since he relinquishes an important position in the social media giant. Will Musk be able to influence the use of DOGE in Twitter payment from a different role other than the CEO? That would be the question that DOGE fans would ponder. The negative sentiment around it could influence the price of Dogecoin. But investors will, at least, hope that DOGE does not crash below 200-day MA.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>DOGE faces pressure as the selling continues below $0.09 support</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2022/11/20/1671568276674-18864e69-368a-4fce-b8d1-d56cc946927d.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="285"></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/DOGEUSD/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>DOGE/USD Chart by TradingView</u></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Investors have been selling DOGE aggressively since tapping $0.11. That is indicated by the RSI reading shifting from above the midpoint to a near-oversold reading.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">From the daily chart outlook, the price has lost crucial support at $0.09, welcoming a bear market. DOGE has also crashed below the 50-day MA. The cryptocurrency now trades at the 200-day MA, an important level that could spell doom for bulls.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Will DOGE trade lower or higher?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">The next direction for&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/dogecoin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>DOGE price</u></a> will depend on whether the 200-day MA will hold. If bulls resist bears, DOGE could roar back to $0.09. On the flip side, DOGE will head to $0.058 support.</p>

<p dir="ltr">ETH rose 2% on Tuesday, becoming the top gainer among the #10 cryptocurrencies.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">ConsenSys announced the entry of PayPal on MetaMask for ETH purchases.</p>

<p dir="ltr">ETH remains subdued by resistance at $1,250 and moving averages.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/ethereum/what-is-ethereum/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Ethereum</u></a> (ETH/USD) was the top gainer among cryptocurrencies in the top 10 by market cap on Tuesday. ETH rose more than 2% on the day, even as most tokens remained in the red. The gains come amid positive&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cryptocurrency news</u></a> and as technical indicators realign.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to the latest announcement by ConsenSys, PayPal is entering the crypto wallet MetaMask. ConsenSys said that MetaMask users in the US would be able to purchase ETH on PayPal. The move allows MetaMask to become the first Web3-focused wallet to integrate PayPal for on-ramp transactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">ETH purchases via PayPal on MetaMask may have boosted ETH&rsquo;s price, which was already struggling at $1,200. Meanwhile, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has mentioned crypto wallets as one area that carries a &ldquo;huge&rdquo; opportunity in crypto. As if to laud MetaMask, Buterin says investors can reap big by building a wallet that billions of people can use. Other opportunities that Buterin recognises are building stablecoins and using crypto to unseat big tech over the internet.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>ETH becomes slightly bullish, but resistance at $1,250 adds pressure</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2022/11/20/1671567919649-1ea0092b-fa30-4946-97f8-1826bb264234.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="319"></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSD/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ETH/USD Chart by TradingView</u></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">A daily chart technical outlook shows ETH on a slight upside but trapped by resistance at $1,250. In the latest price surge, ETH was rejected at the 50-day MA despite piercing through $1,250.</p>
<p dir="ltr">ETH remains at the mercy of bears as long as the price is below $1,250 and the moving averages. The RSI reading also shows that bears are in control of price. The level at $1,200 also offers minor support, and bulls could have been attracted, leading to the intraday gains.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>ETH &ndash; What to watch for?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">A break above $1,250 and moving averages are the immediate price action to watch for&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/ethereum/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ETH price</u></a>. On the bear side, ETH could become more vulnerable if the price crashes below $1,000.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/what-is-bitcoin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Bitcoin</u></a> (BTC/USD) traded slightly below $17,000 on Tuesday, initially losing an opportunity to claim $19,000. A technical outlook shows that BTC has successfully defended $16,000 against the bears, signalling a potential reversal zone. But as the price once again stabilises, one key analyst recommends that investors wait for a key bullish signal.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Renowned crypto trader and analyst Kaleo tells Bitcoin enthusiasts to wait for a classic technical indicator for a bull market. According to him, Bitcoin initiates a bull market each time the price crosses above the 200-day moving average. He says although his strategy is simple, it has been a signature indicator on the BTC chart in its last cycles. Kaleo tells his followers to remain patient until the key signal pops up.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">But the analyst holds the view that Bitcoin could fall further. He sees a scenario where BTC consolidates and then declines to another low in a bear market. Kaleo says a bullish spike could occur somewhere in June 2023.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>BTC gets rejected at the 50-day MA&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2022/11/20/1671557413334-4363f130-a325-4036-ab1a-cdc8b5c24907.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="311"></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>BTC/USD Chart by TradingView</u></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">On the technical front, BTC is steadying after a correction. The price was rejected at the 50-day MA, with the cryptocurrency lacking a directional bias in a bear market. The RSI has again fallen below the midpoint, signalling the entry of bears or bull exhaustion.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Applying the 200-day MA on the daily chart, BTC trades way below it. It could take several months to see the price crossing above it.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Which way is the BTC price?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">From the technical outlook,&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/#:~:text=What%20is%20BTC%20price%20today,in%20the%20last%2024%20hours." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>BTC price</u></a> could struggle for a while before we see a sustained bullish surge. If, indeed, BTC will become bullish when the price crosses above the 200-day MA, then we could wait longer for it to happen. Still, there is no indication that the bear market is nearing an end, although bulls remain strong at $16,000.</p>

Probably, you are wondering which coins to buy that will return big. There are several top contenders, of course, but if given a choice to make, the following will return big:</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Bitcoin (BTC)</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Can you even talk about cryptocurrencies without mentioning&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/what-is-bitcoin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Bitcoin</u></a> (BTC/USD)? Being a renowned cryptocurrency makes BTC a top cryptocurrency to consider. It is the largest cryptocurrency by market cap. In fact, Bitcoin sets the trend for crypto markets. The cryptocurrency is referred to as the digital gold as investors see it as a hedge against inflation. That&rsquo;s despite losing its value this year owing to a prolonged crypto winter.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite trading at below $17,000, BTC hit $68,000 at the height of the crypto boom last year. Investors have speculated that the cryptocurrency will soon run into hundreds of thousands of dollars. A return to the previous ATH should make enough returns if you invest in BTC.</p>
