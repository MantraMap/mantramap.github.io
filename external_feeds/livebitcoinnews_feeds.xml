										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Erik Voorhees, the CEO and founder of crypto exchange Shape Shift, sees bitcoin – the world’s number one digital currency by market cap – reaching a <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/bitcoin-at-40k-by-summer-shapeshift-ceo-thinks-it-s-possible-even-as-tim-draper-sticks-to-bigger-estimate-1031997121" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">relatively modest price</a> of about $40,000 at some point this year.</p>
<h2>Erik Voorhees: BTC Will Be at $40K</h2>
<p>2022 was a rough period for bitcoin. The asset fell by more than 70 percent from its all-time high of $68,000 per unit and dropped into the mid-$16,000 range. Things have been bad for the currency and its altcoin cousins for some time, though there is good news in that we are seeing similar patterns to what was witnessed in the crypto arena around four years ago. If these patterns continue, 2023 could be the year in which a dose of healing is delivered.</p>
<p>As we all remember, for example, 2018 saw the currency fall from a 2017 high of just under $20K to a new low of about $3,500 11 months later. Things weren’t looking great for the asset, though 2019 saw the currency experience a rise into the $15K range by the summer. Things began dipping from there, and bitcoin still ended those 12 months on a relatively low note (around $7,000), though it was far better than where it was a year earlier.</p>
<p>If we’re to assume things will continue in this matter and 2023 is reminiscent of 2019, $40K as proposed by Voorhees is something we can all easily believe in. it’s not quite where it was during its 2021 peak, but it’s still far better than what we witnessed last year.</p>
<p>In an interview, Erik Voorhees mentioned that bitcoin could reach this price as early as summer of 2023, and that he “wouldn’t be surprised” if such action occurred even sooner. This would make sense given that summer of 2019 is also when we witnessed the peak point of post 2018 recovery.</p>
<p>It’s hard to assume what could truly happen, however, given the high number of predictions about what bitcoin will do over the next several months. Many analysts claim to be the experts about where bitcoin will travel in the future, and a consistent problem with their predictions is they all tend to be somewhat over the top.</p>
<h2>So Many People Predicting Where Bitcoin Will Soon Go</h2>
<p>Perhaps the one that most fits this description is Tim Draper’s <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tim-draper-still-predicts-big-things-for-btc/" data-wpel-link="internal">notion that bitcoin will</a> somehow hit $250K before 2023’s end. For this to happen, bitcoin would need to see a rise of more than $230,000 in the next 12 months. While we cannot deny that anything is possible in the crypto space, the idea of such high gains in such a short period feels very far fetched.</p>
<p>Other analysts are at <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/the-boldest-bitcoin-calls-for-2023-are-out-and-a-1400-rally-or-a-70-plunge-may-be-on-the-cards/ar-AA15SUkQ" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">the opposite end of the spectrum</a>, with companies like Standard Chartered saying bitcoin could fall another $11K and reach $5,000 per unit before things get better.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2022 was a year wrought with bankruptcy and <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/will-2023-bring-more-crypto-bankruptcies-to-weed-out-the-pumps-and-the-frauds/ar-AA15VQp9" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">the exiting of several crypto</a> companies, but many analysts do not feel this was necessarily a bad thing.</p>
<h2>Bankruptcy was Big in 2022, but Things Might&#8217;ve Been Better Than We Thought</h2>
<p>On the surface, one could argue that 2022 was the worst year for crypto since 2018. The price of bitcoin, for example, fell by more than 70 percent after the world’s number one digital currency by market cap hit a new all-time high in the final months of 2021. During that time, BTC rose to a whopping $68,000 per unit, though after that, it endured a series of losses that brought it down into the mid-$16K range.</p>
<p>The whole crypto space followed suit and wound up losing about $2 trillion in valuation. On top of that, many high-ranking crypto firms – from <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/crypto-mining-firm-compute-north-files-for-bankruptcy/" data-wpel-link="internal">Compute North</a> to the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/what-will-happen-now-that-ftx-is-bankrupt/" data-wpel-link="internal">FTX</a> digital currency exchange – joined a long list of companies that had to endure bankruptcy proceedings either because they couldn’t cope with the ongoing volatility or because they engaged in faulty practices.</p>
<p>But people like Chad Harris are telling fans of crypto that the bankruptcy filings they witnessed last year shouldn’t strike fear in their hearts. Instead, people need to look at them as necessary steps for weeding out all bad actors. He says these bankruptcies have helped to purify the crypto space somewhat, and that the more this happens, the stronger the industry will become.</p>
<p>Chad Harris is a chief commercial officer at Riot Blockchain, arguably one of the most prominent crypto mining enterprises in the world. He stated in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>Two years ago, this audience was packed. Today, this is an audience full of passionate people who believe that they can facilitate what they tell the public. I think it’s important because every single time one of us fails in a disastrous way, it affects every one of us in this room.</p></blockquote>
<p>Texas Blockchain Council president Lee Bratcher offered similar sentiment. While he is disappointed in the many collapses that occurred last year, he thinks this will pave the way for better, stronger crypto companies to enter the fray. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The sentiment is we’re disappointed in FTX, but we’re resolved and optimistic about the future of the industry. We’re rolling up our sleeves and moving forward… We are bullish on the future. I think the worst is behind us.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Not Everyone&#8217;s Excited</h2>
<p>Others, however, such as Jackie Sawicky – an environmentalist that’s currently protesting the establishment of a new Riot Blockchain facility in northern Texas – thinks more negativity is going to strike the crypto space in the coming weeks. She said:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is not just a bubble. It’s collapsing. It is a dying industry. The problem is a lot of these things can’t be undone. There are real-world consequences for people who invested with these companies.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Valkyrie Investments is working to become the new <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/valkyrie-unveils-proposal-grayscale-troubled-181233698.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">sponsor and manager of</a> the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, arguably the largest digital currency fund in existence.</p>
<h2>Valkyrie Investments Wants a Bigger Role in Grayscale&#8217;s Environment</h2>
<p>Based in Nashville, Tennessee, Valkyrie is tasked with managing $180 million in assets. In late December, the firm announced what’s to be called the Valkyrie Opportunistic Fund, which will take advantage of discounts being offered through Grayscale Investments. Valkyrie will thus increase its bitcoin holdings in the fund so it can realize the full value of bitcoin. It will also pursue additional bitcoin and digital currency opportunities for the sake of its customers.</p>
<p>In a statement, Steven McClurg – the co-founder and CIO of Valkyrie Investments – mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>We understand that Grayscale has played an important role in the development and growth of the bitcoin ecosystem with the launch of GBTC, and we respect the team and the work that they have done. However, [due to] recent events involving Grayscale and its family of affiliated companies, it is time for a change. Valkyrie is the best company to manage GBTC to ensure its investors are treated fairly.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Valkyrie is all set to obtain more bitcoin through Grayscale, how much control the company will have over future maneuvers is questionable given Grayscale’s current business model. The company has made it clear that no shareholders have sway over management protocols, nor do they have voting rights in the company. In addition, all changes or maneuvers can only be acted upon unless there is a majority decision regarding the shares. This means 50 percent or more.</p>
<p>As it stands, Grayscale shares are trading for around 50 percent less than the price of the bitcoin units held within the company’s grasp. This makes sense in many ways given how low bitcoin has fallen in recent months, and companies that tie themselves so directly to BTC – such as <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/microstrategy-stock-crashes-thanks-to-btc-plunge/" data-wpel-link="internal">MicroStrategy and Coinbase</a> – have not had it easy, as when bitcoin falls, their stocks usually fall along with it.</p>
<p>To say 2022 was a bad year for bitcoin and its many altcoin cousins would be a terrible understatement. BTC fell by more than 70 percent from its all-time high of about $68,000 per unit, which it achieved in November of 2021. From there, the currency experienced a long series of losses that caused it to fall into the mid-$16K range just before the end of 2022.</p>
<h2>A Rough Patch for Both Entities?</h2>
<p>Grayscale worked hard last year to become an exchange-traded fund of sorts based on bitcoin, though this notion (unsurprisingly) was rejected by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Grayscale has since struck up a lawsuit against the agency to give itself a fighting chance.</p>
<p>Valkyrie has been around for roughly two years, first opening its doors for business in January of 2021.</p>

<li>The pair could continue to rise if it stays above the $0.0870 and $0.0850 support levels.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Stellar lumen price is trading above $0.0880 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-rally-could-extend-above-22k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin</a>. XLM price must stay above the $0.0850 support to rise further.</em></p>
<h2>Stellar Lumen Price Analysis (XLM to USD)</h2>
<p>After forming a base above the $0.080 level, stellar lumen price started a fresh increase against the US Dollar. The XLM/USD pair broke the $0.082 resistance zone to move into a positive zone.</p>
<p>The price even broke the $0.0880 resistance and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/stellar-lumen-xlm-price-climbs-higher-and-aims-a-move-to-0-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4-hours)</a>. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $0.0875 on the 4-hours chart. The price is now trading comfortably above the $0.088 level.</p>
<p>On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $0.0938 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.0950 level.  A clear move above the $0.0950 level might send the price towards the $0.100 level.</p>
<p>Any more gains could lead the price towards the $0.1080 level or even $0.1120 in the coming days. An initial support on the downside is near the $0.0900 level. It is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.0818 swing high to $0.0937 low.</p>
<p>The next major support sits near the $0.0875 level or the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.0818 swing high to $0.0937 low.</p>
<p>The main support is near the $0.085 zone. Any more losses could lead the price towards the $0.082 level in the near term, below which the price might even retest $0.080.</p>

<p>The price even broke the $0.3900 resistance and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ripple-price-analysis-uptrend-in-place-above-0-40/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4-hours)</a>. The pair is now trading above the $0.400 resistance. It is also showing positive signs above $0.3900 and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours).</p>
<p>On the upside, the price is facing resistance near $0.4085.  The next major resistance is near the $0.4160 level. A clear move above the $0.4160 resistance zone might start a strong increase. In the stated case, the price could even surpass the $0.4350 resistance.</p>
<p>Any more gains might send the price towards the $0.4800 resistance. An initial support on the downside is near the $0.3920 level. It is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.3655 swing low to $0.4164 high.</p>
<p>There is also a major bullish trend line forming with support near $0.3910 on the 4-hours chart of the XRP/USD pair. The next major support is near the $0.3775 level.</p>
<p>It is near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.3655 swing low to $0.4164 high. Any more losses could lead the price towards the $0.3500 level, below which the price might even test $0.3350.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you lost your crypto <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/password/" data-wpel-link="internal">password</a> and can’t gain access to your funds? Crypto Asset Recovery can <a href="https://venturebeat.com/security/how-a-father-and-son-are-helping-cryptocurrency-users-recover-their-lost-assets/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">help you with that</a>.</p>
<h2>Crypto Asset Recovery Helps with Lost Passwords</h2>
<p>Crypto Asset Recovery is a father and son team that works to help people that have lost access to their digital asset portfolios. Usually, the money is locked up in a secure crypto wallet or encrypted somewhere. The people in question cannot engage in a lost-their-password process to set up a new access point.</p>
<p>Last year, Chainalysis – a blockchain analysis firm – released a report claiming that as much as 23 percent of the world’s total bitcoin units have been lost to time simply because people can no longer access them due to lost passwords. Today, this would be worth about $62 billion.</p>
<p>Crypto Asset Recovery is made up of Chris Brooks, the father, and Charles Brooks, his son. They work to help people gain access to the crypto they’ve lost. If they’re successful, they garner 20 percent of the once-lost stashes, while returning the rest to the owners. They’re usually paid in bitcoin and sometimes, they warn, the recovery process can take a year or longer.</p>
<p>Prior to getting involved in the crypto space, Chris was a former vice president of technology at a company called Care Scout. He said that while he read the initial bitcoin whitepaper in 2014, it took him a while to get excited about the new currency and the technology behind it. He stated in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>I looked at some mining opportunities and some trading opportunities, and they just didn’t work for various reasons, and then I started coming across forum posts of people saying, ‘Hey, I’ve lost the password to my wallet,’ and I thought, ‘I’m a programmer. I know how to solve that problem,’ and so I started this in 2017.</p></blockquote>
<p>Right after that year, the price of bitcoin wound up crashing and burning, so he stepped away from his business and decided to put more time and energy into a separate entity. However, given the high rate of password recovery demand he was witnessing in 2020 and 2021, he made a triumphant return.</p>
<h2>A Return of Sorts</h2>
<p>Charles threw his two cents into the mix, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>For me, it’s like digital treasure hunting, and it really has this life-changing bounty at the end of a rainbow sometimes. We decided to spin up Crypto Asset Recovery again, and we spun it up kind of on the presumption of running this for a month or two to see if we have market fit… It was clear there was market fit and a need for this kind of service in the space.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s a positive sign to know that so many people are still interested in maintaining their crypto portfolios despite dramatic losses of the past 12 months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite all that’s happened over the past 12 months, millennials <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/personalfinance/should-millennials-rely-on-crypto-for-retirement/ar-AA115E6P" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">see value in crypto</a>. In fact, they’re betting big on digital assets and relying on them to comprise their retirement portfolios.</p>
<h2>Millennials Are Still Big Crypto Fans</h2>
<p>This is good in that <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/millennials/" data-wpel-link="internal">millennials</a> clearly understand the value of the crypto space. They see the arena as something big that could potentially bring them many rewards in the future, but several financial analysts are telling said millennials not to go crazy. They say crypto is still a largely unregulated industry, and that betting too big on it could result in heavy losses and similar problems.</p>
<p>Clark Hodges – co-owner of Hodges Capital Management – said in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>No, no, no. As I sit here and contemplate millennials considering cryptocurrencies as the base for their retirement plans, it really does concern me for their futures.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s not so much that he’s against crypto; he’s against placing too much money on any high-risk asset. He continued his discussion with:</p>
<blockquote><p>A risky asset should be a small part of a retirement strategy, not the full strategy. Cryptocurrencies are assets that are still very new and unregulated, which increases their risk. What will the landscape look like after the government gets in and has its effect on the cryptocurrency market? I would not want to own cryptocurrency in a major way when that is unfolding right before our very eyes. Traditional stocks and bonds and real estate assets as a long-term retirement strategy are still the most proven way to grow wealth over time. Do what has worked for decades. Buy good quality American companies with good quality earnings that go up in value because the companies make more money year in and year out.</p></blockquote>
<p>Matthew Robbs – founder of Smart Saving Advice – says it’s quite easy to invest in crypto when it’s doing well, and he doesn’t think giving up on it completely is something any smart investor should do. He commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>Crypto is exciting to invest in. If you pick the right coin at the right time, you can get five, ten, or 100 times your investment in a matter of a few months or years… In the last two years, bitcoin went from $10,000 to $55,000 in five months and then went from $55,000 to $33,000 in four months. Bitcoin then went up to $69,000 before plummeting to $17,000 over a seven-month period.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Slow and Steady Wins the Race</h2>
<p>He says throwing a bunch of money into the industry at once might be a mistake. He instead says slow and steady contributions to one’s crypto portfolio over time is the right way to go:</p>
<blockquote><p>Investing all your retirement income into crypto only to have it drop 75 percent over a seven-month period will likely cause you to give up on it right before it starts to make another run-up.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’re early into 2023, and with 2022 being such a crazy year for <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin</a> fans, it appears many analysts are warning about what we <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/cbovaird/2022/12/30/what-do-bitcoin-investors-need-to-know-in-these-frozen-markets/?sh=509b57b971b0" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">should be aware of</a> in these next 12 months so traders can make appropriate investing decisions and keep themselves safe.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin May Bottom Out Soon</h2>
<p>One of the people to talk about what we should expect is Tim Enneking, the managing director of Digital Capital Management. He says one of the big things that’s happened is crypto is beginning to mirror more traditional assets like stocks. This has ultimately made it vulnerable to economic issues like inflation.</p>
<p>In an interview, he stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>The biggest variable affecting BTC at present is, unfortunately, correlation. Assuming correlation remains high (and there is no reason to assume otherwise), crypto markets are beholden to fiat markets, which means inflation and interest rates. Since interest rate increases (first derivative from freshman calculus) have already begun slowing, and they will almost certainly stop no later than mid-March (after probably a final 50 bps increase on Feb 1 and then a first and last 25-bps increase), I wouldn’t look for a major breakout for BTC until then.</p></blockquote>
<p>He did offer a more positive outlook on bitcoin’s short-term stamina, however, and he does think a gradual (albeit small) rise can be expected in 2023 just like it was seen in 2019 after the disastrous 2018. He commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>The good news is BTC is putting in a solid bottom, which, however, leaves everyone haunted by the seeming floor at $6K from late June to early November 2019, which felt like a strong bottom until it fell out and BTC went to $3+K for four months. Since the fallout from Celsius, Terra/Luna, FTX, Alameda, etc., has slowed markedly, our feeling is that we’re at or very near the bottom (which is $15.5K). As strange as it feels to write this sentence, a couple good days on Wall Street and we should see BTC threaten $20K.</p></blockquote>
<p>Joe DiPasquale – the CEO of crypto hedge fund Bit Bull Capital – also threw his two cents into the mix, mentioning in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>At the moment, many are predicting a capitulation to under $10K. However, we don’t think the chances of such a possibility are higher than bitcoin bottoming around $13-$15K.</p></blockquote>
<h2>A Lot of Bad Stuff in the News, Lately</h2>
<p>Marc Bernegger – co-founder of crypto fund Alt Alpha Digital – said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin already experienced similar phases in the past years, which could be summarized as ‘times of ignorance and disinterest.’ We saw several very negative events in the last few weeks and months, and many investors lost confidence in bitcoin as a potential hedge during downturns of traditional markets. Many fundamentals indicate a bottom at the actual price levels and investors like hedge funds, family offices, and asset managers wait on the sideline to (re)allocate part of their alternative assets into bitcoin.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of investors that filed a class-action lawsuit against <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/coinbase-customers-block-attempts-move-133216210.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">popular digital currency exchange</a> Coinbase are now withholding their account information as a means of preventing their case from moving into arbitration territory. They want to see their situation escalate to the American court system and placed before a judge.</p>
<h2>Could Coinbase Find Itself in Court?</h2>
<p>The customers allege that the security measures initiated by Coinbase against hackers and cyberthieves were weak and resulted in the loss of funds. In addition, they say Coinbase has worked hard not to compensate those who have fallen victim to criminal activity.</p>
<p>One plaintiff mentioned in the lawsuit says that he had $6,000 in crypto funds illegally taken from his wallet and moved to an address that wasn’t his. He also alleges that Coinbase did nothing to prevent the hackers from accessing his banking data, and that they stole another $1,000 from his bank account.</p>
<p>After calling the institution and reversing the transaction, he was able to receive his funds back, though Coinbase locked his account and cited a negative balance in his wallet. The complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. It alleges that Coinbase does not use “standard practices” to keep its customers protected, nor does it reasonably allow customers access to their accounts on a permanent or at least extended basis.</p>
<p>Coinbase, like many digital currency enterprises, has had a very hard time as of late due to the ongoing bearish conditions of the crypto space. The exchange initially announced that 2022 was going to be a year of hiring new personnel and adding to its growing roster of staff members, though this plan <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-says-its-freezing-all-2022-hiring-plans/" data-wpel-link="internal">became frozen in place when</a> bitcoin started losing value very quickly last year.</p>
<p>Things then took a turn for the worse when <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-says-its-laying-off-several-employees/" data-wpel-link="internal">the exchange said</a> it would be laying off about 18 percent of its staff, claiming it could not keep up with the ongoing volatility and thus could not afford to pay all the required salaries giving how tied it was to BTC, which was falling faster than anyone could have predicted.</p>
<p>Still, however, the company has garnered a certain degree of support from crypto heads such as Cathie Wood of <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/cathie-woods-ark-invest-buys-122536067.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">Ark Invest fame</a>. Not long ago, Wood decided to double down on her ownership of Coinbase stock and purchased several more shares given that they had dipped dramatically from where they were when the company first <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-spikes-following-public-debut-of-coinbase/" data-wpel-link="internal">went public on the</a> Nasdaq in April of 2021.</p>
<h2>Wood Still Predicts Big Things for the Firm</h2>
<p>Explaining her decision, Wood wrote in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>To the extent investors have reserves of cash to put to work, ARK believes that this time will be no different and that innovation strategies will be prime beneficiaries when equity markets recover.</p></blockquote>
