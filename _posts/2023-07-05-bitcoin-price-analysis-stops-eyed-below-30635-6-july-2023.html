<p>BTC/USD Bears Eye Stops Below 30635:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 6 July 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) continued to orbit the 31000 figure early in the Asian session as the pair remained within striking distance of testing the recent twelve-month high around the 31443.67 area, just below an upside price objective associated with buying pressure that strengthened around the 26637.41 area. Decent selling pressure intensified around the 31142.38 area and this elevates the risk of another test of the 29427 area, representing the 38.2% retracement of the broader appreciating range from 26165.98 to 31443.67.&nbsp; &nbsp;Below that area, the 28604.83 level represents the 50% retracement of that appreciating range.&nbsp; Additional upside price objectives include the 31737, 32125, and 33569 areas.&nbsp; Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 31674, 32043, 34531, and 34658 areas.</p>
