			            <description><![CDATA[Bitcoin's price has been consolidating for too long, according to some. Will the market explode soon? ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The past seven days have mostly been centered around Bitcoin and the aftermath of the ruling in the case between Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. That said, the total market capitalization declined by some $11 billion throughout the same period, as investors are wary of future uncertainty.</p>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price has largely remained around the $30K area &#8211; a pivotal level that&#8217;s consisted of significant technical but also psychological resistance. BTC attempted a push above $31K halfway through the week but to no avail. The bears were quick to intercept and ruined the upward momentum, pushing the price to a weekly low at around $29,700. All in all, Bitcoin remained largely rangebound.</p>
<p>However, according to a well-known and prominent analyst &#8211; Willy Woo &#8211; the cryptocurrency has been consolidating for too long. Based on a number of indicators, a lot of which are bullish, Woo observed that the rangebound trading might soon come to an end. Historically, he says, this ends up in a major move. Will BTC finally escape the $30K level? We&#8217;ve yet to see.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States remains silent on the case against Ripple. But Chairman Gary Gensler did have something to say.</p>
<p>He outlined that they are disappointed at Judge Torres&#8217; ruling but also said they&#8217;re assessing the situation. In other words &#8211; there&#8217;s no certainty of whether an appeal will come to light. Recall that last week, a US court ruled partially in favor of Ripple, determining that secondary sales of XRP did not constitute an investment contract.</p>
<p>All in all, the week has been relatively quiet without a lot of developments in terms of price. If history has taught us one thing, though, it&#8217;s that the cryptocurrency market doesn&#8217;t do quiet very well. So keep an eye turned to the charts because this might as well be the calm before the storm.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[A Bitcoin impersonator has suddenly risen to prominence on Uniswap after months of stagnancy.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The “BITCOIN” cryptocurrency has skyrocketed by over 300% in value over the past week – gains the world’s largest cryptocurrency could only hope to gain through a massive influx of investor capital.</p>
<p>That said, a closer look shows that’s not exactly what happened.</p>
<ul>
<li>“BITCOIN” is actually the ticker symbol for a relatively new meme token, called HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu (ERC-20).</li>
<li>Data from CoinMarketCap shows that the token is suddenly generating over $14 million in daily volume, mostly on UniswapV2 on Ethereum.</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>“HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu (Ticker: BITCOIN) is an endgame of crypto-assets (0 Tax),” reads the token’s description. “BITCOIN incentivizes the creation of novel and entertaining meme content.”</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>The token’s value suddenly began to rise starting last week, from just $0.015 on July 13 to a high of $0.09 on July 20. It trades for $0.067 at writing time, with an estimated market cap of $66 million.</li>
<li>The coin launched in mid-May, around the time that a mountain of memecoins began rallying in light of Pepe (PEPE)’s rise to prominence.</li>
<li>It was also when <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/vitalik-buterin-lauds-bitcoin-ordinals-believes-brc-20-standard-could-revive-stagnancy/" data-wpel-link="internal">BRC20 tokens</a> started to popularize as a means of launching meme tokens on the actual Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain.</li>
<li>Spinoff coins are nothing new and have at times seen some success. Shiba Inu (SHIB) was launched in 2020 as a spinoff of Dogecoin (DOGE), and briefly overtook the latter’s market cap roughly one year later.</li>
</ul>

			            <description><![CDATA[ Solana's February outage, which was the only one recorded this year, knocked the network offline for almost 19 hours.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Solana network has not suffered any outages in the last five months and has been 100% uptime since February. The enhanced network performance marks a striking transformation from the previous year when layer-1 network outages caused severe disruptions.</p>
<p>A new report released by Solana Foundation stated that the subsequent upgrades, including the rollout of QUIC TPU, Stake weighted QoS, and localized fee markets, have helped the network to handle high traffic and demand.</p>
<h2>Solana Completes One Whole Quarter Without Outage</h2>
<p>The foundation mentioned that Solana &#8211; run by a group of independent validators around the world &#8211; has demonstrated improvements across various performance metrics.</p>
<p>This includes enhancements in ratios of non-voting-to-voting transactions. A voting transaction happens when a validator votes to confirm one or more proposed blocks of information. On the other hand, non-voting transactions are the ones triggered by user behavior on the blockchain.</p>
<p>In the latest <a href="https://solana.com/news/network-performance-report-july-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">report</a>, Solana Foundation said that it expects &#8220;to see the ratio of voting to non-voting transactions go down because the overall percentage of voting transactions should drop as the network gets more efficient.&#8221;</p>
<p>The block production time &#8211; which measures how quickly the network adds more &#8220;blocks&#8221; to the blockchain &#8211; has followed a consistent trajectory besides a spike during the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/solana-network-suffers-20-hour-outage-root-cause-still-unknown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">February outage. </a></p>
<p>Moreover, the average transactions per second on the Solana network remained relatively similar since December 2022. Some volatility was observed, which correlated with high network demand, the foundation&#8217;s statement read. The maximum daily transactions per second have been on a steady rise since January. Data from Dune Analytics suggests that the network currently <a href="https://dune.com/queries/2753221/4581161" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">recorded</a> 3,781 TPS as of July 20.</p>
<h2>Network Upgrades</h2>
<p>The improvements across the metrics were achieved after core developers rolled out upgrades that enabled the network to perform well in times of high stress.</p>
<p>The Solana devs have doubled down on testing while developing other network upgrades and initiatives, including increasing maximum transaction sizes (currently limited to 1232 bytes). Simplifying the voting logic, which reduces the overall amount of data needed to be transmitted and stored, is yet another aspect that the devs are working on.</p>
<p>According to the Solana Foundation, the advancements have helped solidify its position in the layer-1 space after its credibility was severely dented by a series of outages last year.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The upcoming changes could give the DOJ "the resources and runway to accomplish even more," senior official Nicole Argentieri stated.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Department of Justice (DOJ) of the United States plans to reinforce its team responsible for investigating cryptocurrency-related crimes with more prosecutors. The unit will also have a new leader, with Claudia Quiroz replacing Eun Young Choi at the helm.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The team has played a major role in many of the DOJ&#8217;s crypto cases, such as bringing charges against Bitzlato and the investigation into Binance.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bringing NCET to &#8216;the Next Level&#8217;</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The DOJ <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-revamps-crypto-enforcement-team-73638efb?mod=lead_feature_below_a_pos1" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">disclosed</a> that it will more than double the number of prosecutors working for the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET) to prevent future crimes involving digital assets.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The unit will also become a permanent fixture of a section within the department&#8217;s criminal division focused on various computer-related probes. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Senior Justice Department official Nicole Argentieri revealed that Claudia Quiroz will serve as the NCET&#8217;s new leader, raising hopes that the amendments will bring the team &#8220;to the next level.&#8221;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Merging it into [Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section] will give it the resources and runway to accomplish even more,&#8221; she added.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The DOJ established the NCET in 2021 amid concerns that criminals, terrorists, and other wrongdoers have employed cryptocurrencies in their illicit activities.

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Interestingly, two months later, the cryptocurrency community witnessed the doom of FTX: seen by many as one of the biggest scams in the history of the industry. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ari Redbord &#8211; a former federal prosecutor who works at blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs &#8211; believes the DOJ has realized that &#8220;we&#8217;ve moved to a digital battlefield, where wars are fought on blockchains.&#8221;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;The reality is if this is, in fact, the future, every prosecutor, every investigator, is going to need to understand these cases,&#8221; he concluded.</span></p></blockquote>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, we take a closer look at Ethereum, Ripple, Cardano, Solana, and Polygon.</p>
<h2>Ethereum (ETH)</h2>
<p>Ethereum has shown indecision in the past week. This allowed sellers to take over the price action, which ended the week with a 5% loss. Despite this correction, the cryptocurrency remains above the key support at $1,820.</p>
<p>The current resistance is found at $2,000. ETH tried several times to turn this key level into support, but buyers were not strong enough, and the price fell under it every time.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, ETH seems likely to continue to range above the key support until the market forces push for a breakout. Considering that bears have the upper hand right now, do not exclude a possible test of the key support at $1,820.</p>

<h2>Ripple (XRP)</h2>
<p>XRP has managed to maintain its most recent gains, booking a modest 3% loss as the price consolidates above the key support at $0.68. While most altcoins entered a deeper correction, XRP is holding quite well at current levels.</p>
<p>The key resistance is found at $0.93 cents, and so far, sellers did not allow the price to move above it. It is likely that the psychological level at $1 will attract a lot of sellers in the future looking to secure profits.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, XRP should be well positioned to hold above 68 cents as buyers prepare another attempt at breaking the key resistance.</p>

<h2>Cardano (ADA)</h2>
<p>In contrast to XRP, ADA has failed to retain most of its gains, and the price retraced nearly in full to the key support at 30 cents. In the process, it lost 10% of its valuation in the past week.</p>
<p>With buyers unable to push higher, they are left to defend the key support. This shows weakness in the price action, and there is little hope that ADA can make any significant moves at this time. The current resistance is at 35 cents.</p>
<p><span style="color: #2b2b2b;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead</span></span>, ADA has lost its bullish momentum. Buyers will have to wait for another opportunity until they attempt another move to reach the key targets at 35 and 38 cents.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">Solana (SOL)</span></p>
<p>Solana has entered a corrective period, booking a 10% loss this past week. This is not so concerning so long the price manages to hold above the key support at $25.</p>
<p>The current resistance levels are found at $28 and $33. SOL will have to break above these levels if the price is to continue its uptrend. Considering the price already doubled since June, it seems unlikely for the bulls will manage this in the short term.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, this cryptocurrency should focus on consolidating most of its recent gains and defend the key support level. This will allow it to create a strong base for a continuation of the uptrend.</p>
<figure id="attachment_261746" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-261746" style="width: 2854px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-21_10-52-27.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-261746" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-21_10-52-27.png" alt="SOLUSDT_2023-07-21_10-52-27" width="2854" height="1458" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-21_10-52-27.png 2854w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-21_10-52-27-300x153.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-21_10-52-27-1024x523.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-21_10-52-27-768x392.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-21_10-52-27-1536x785.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-21_10-52-27-2048x1046.png 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOLUSDT_2023-07-21_10-52-27-50x26.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2854px) 100vw, 2854px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-261746" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">Polygon (MATIC) </span></p>
<p>MATIC is also found in a correction after a spike in the price took it to 90 cents. The current support is at 75 cents, and the price is slowly approaching this key level after losing 9% of its valuation this past week.</p>
<p>Such a correction is to be expected, considering that MATIC was at 50 cents in June. Any sharp increase in the price is usually followed by a pullback.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, if this cryptocurrency holds at 75 cents, then the uptrend will remain intact and allow buyers to try again to break the resistance at 90 cents. However, such price action will also depend on the overall market, which has to turn bullish to allow for this.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[Press Release &#8211; Seoul, South Korea, July 21st, 2023]</strong></p>
<p>Superblock, a contributor to <a href="https://www.over.network/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Over Protocol</a>, has raised $8 million from prominent companies and VCs in South Korea across two funding rounds. Investors included SK, Netmarble, DSC, E&amp;Investment, Schmidt, SpringCamp, and NaverZ.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ben (Jae-Yun) Kim, the founder of Superblock, said: &#8220;We are deeply diving into the South Korea market with the best local partners and looking to meet global partners accelerating us all over the world.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>As layer 1 blockchains have become faster and more established over time, the costs of bootstrapping and maintaining nodes have become increasingly expensive. As a consequence, blockchain applications have become challenging to operate without the use of costly equipment.</p>
<p>Over Protocol is a new layer 1 blockchain based on a protocol named &#8220;Ethanos&#8221; that only considers active accounts valid, enabling full nodes to discard obsolete data and operate with less storage, thus allowing for reduced storage requirements. With Over, anyone will be able to run a node and become a validator on their PCs at home. Ethanos has been published at EuroSys’21.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;With the ability for anyone to run a validator, individuals can earn potentially passive income through a process called home staking, enabling them to embrace a new lifestyle with new payment options, enhanced credit, and innovative finance opportunities,&#8221; Ben added.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>About Superblock </strong></p>
<p>Superblock builds products, tools, and decentralized applications to flourish the Over Protocol. Over Protocol is a truly decentralized layer 1 blockchain providing lightweight full nodes.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The advocacy group said that the bill would violate the First Amendment.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The bipartisan legislation introduced earlier this week &#8211; titled the Crypto-Asset National Security Enhancement (CANSEE) Act &#8211; that seeks to regulate the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector has caused quite a stir. Cypto advocacy groups are voicing objection to the bill arguing that such an approach would stifle innovation in the United States.</p>
<p>Coin Center, for one, lashed out at the bill and called it a messy, arbitrary, and unconstitutional approach to DeFi.</p>
<h2>CANSEE: A &#8216;Violation&#8217; of First Amendment</h2>
<p>The bipartisan Crypto-Asset National Security Enhancement Act (CANSEE) bill aims to tackle money laundering violations in DeFi, but legal experts remain skeptical. In a blog <a href="https://www.coincenter.org/the-cansee-act-is-a-messy-arbitrary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">post</a>, the crypto think tank&#8217;s CEO Jerry Brito slammed the bill introduced by Senators Reed, Rounds, Warner, and Romney, saying it &#8220;comes as a surprise&#8221; for lack of inputs from industry stakeholders.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8216;While we appreciate the Senators’ desire to combat the abuse of crypto protocols by criminal and enemy actors, the bill unfortunately also would make the development of such protocols in the U.S. and by U.S. persons unfeasible. Worse, the bill would be unconstitutional legislation as it would clearly violate the First Amendment.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Brito explained that if the legislation is passed, it would extend the penalties to anyone who &#8220;makes available an application designed to facilitate transactions using a digital asset protocol&#8221; as well as to those who &#8220;control a digital asset protocol,&#8221; a factor that will be solely determined by the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<p>Coin Center said that the bill gives &#8220;virtually unbounded discretion&#8221; to the Secretary.</p>
<p>Deeming it &#8220;unconstitutional,&#8221; Brito said that CANSEE could potentially impose crackdowns on developers, thereby leaving them vulnerable to &#8220;prosecution for merely publishing software&#8221; which is a violation of the First Amendment right to publish code.</p>
<h2>Decentralized in Name Only</h2>
<p>Even though the core idea behind <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/decentralized-finance-defi-vanguard-of-financial-revolution-assessing-opportunities-bottlenecks-compliance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">DeFi</a> is a &#8220;decentralized infrastructure&#8221; with no central authority, not all protocols are as decentralized as they claim. To that extent, the Coin Center admitted that it understands the Senators&#8217; approach to prosecute entities who facilitate money laundering and sanctions evasion by providing services that are &#8220;decentralized in name only.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, a blanket ban on the publication of open-source code for decentralized crypto protocols and enabling the Secretary to have sole discretion to give permits to centralized protocols that may as well be traditional financial institutions &#8220;is to cede the field of innovation to the rest of the world&#8221; the advocacy group said.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pepe’s price has shown significant weakness of late, falling 14% in seven days and 2.47% in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>The recent sell-off means the 13 July rally has been canceled out, leading to a head and shoulders pattern on the Pepe price chart.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, the price has dropped below the head and shoulders neckline and crossed below the 21-day exponential moving average.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-20.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-261828" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-20.jpg" alt="Picture4" width="624" height="265" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-20.jpg 624w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-20-300x127.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-20-50x21.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></a></p>
<p>For Pepe to regain bullish momentum, it must reclaim the head and shoulders neckline and use that as support before making a higher high.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Pepe’s inability to hold above $0.000001763 shows a weakening interest in the project and could signify a move toward $0.00000091.</p>
<p>After a sell of beginning on 4 July, Pepe’s price climbed over 13% in one day on 13 July. However, this was because of XRP’s partial victory over the SEC, and sell pressure continued the following day.</p>
<p>Pepe’s social analytics also paint a bearish picture. According to LunarCrush, <a href="https://lunarcrush.com/coins/pepe/pepe?metric=social_volume&amp;interval=1m" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Pepe’s social mentions</a> are down 76% in the last month, while social contributions are down 91%.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture5-7.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-261827" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture5-7.jpg" alt="Picture5" width="624" height="243" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture5-7.jpg 624w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture5-7-300x117.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture5-7-50x19.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></a></p>
<p>Moving to price data, CoinMarketCap shows <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Pepe’s 24-hour trading volume</a> is down 16% at $71,038,214.</p>
<p>The project currently has a $587,924,771 market cap, ranked 68 amongst all cryptocurrencies on CoinMarketCap.</p>
<p>Overall, Pepe’s price and social metrics show that interest is ceasing for the project. Could this be an end of an era, or is this a blip in Pepe’s journey? Ultimately, that remains to be seen.</p>
<p>For Pepe to regain the upwards trajectory, the broader market must display significant strength, and new developments or partnerships could also help boosts its price.</p>
<p>Ultimately, however, Pepe looks bearish in the short term, unable to hold above $0.000001763.</p>
<h2><strong>Traders Back New Token Evil Pepe Coin as a Pepe Alternative</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.care/b_evilpepe_35234?referrer=pepe-coin-price-falls-14-in-7-days-traders-are-buying-evil-pepe-coin-instead" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Evil Pepe</a> is a new Pepe alternative looking to reignite the Pepe hype. Currently available in its presale at $0.000333, the project could provide early investors access to the next meme coin pump.</p>
<p>So far, Evil Pepe has raised over $180K despite launching only a few days ago. However, top media analysts have already picked up the project, so a quick presale is expected.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture6-4.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-261826" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture6-4.jpg" alt="Picture6" width="936" height="380" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture6-4.jpg 936w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture6-4-300x122.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture6-4-768x312.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture6-4-50x20.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px" /></a></p>
<p>The project acts as Pepe’s alter ego, “the voice in your head you know will get you rich.”</p>
<p>90% of the $EVILPEPE tokens will be available in the presale, with the remaining 10% committed to DEX liquidity. This makes the project 100% community-driven and enables the seamless trading of the token.</p>
<p>Thanks to Pepe’s recent disappointing performance, the Evil Pepe community are calling for the project to absorb some of the Pepe community.</p>
<p>Analyst <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEFcrVYWdQM" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Jacob Bury</a> covered the project recently, speculating it could be “the next Pepe”. The Youtuber highlighted that coins inspired by Pepe often perform well.</p>
<p>Evil Pepe’s market cap at launch will be $1,996,002 &#8211; a drop in the ocean compared to Pepe’s $587 million market cap. This presents significant room for growth if the hype continues.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the legendary surge of Pepecoin ($PEPE), new meme coins are popping up everywhere. There are thousands of projects out there, and many analysts go about how investing in meme coins can generate tremendous profits and life-changing returns.</p>
<p>The reality, however, is that finding the right altcoin at the right price to put your hard-earned money in is particularly challenging. A newcomer, <a href="https://www.millionairegame.net/claim-discount-55" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">MillionaireGame ($MG)</a>, claimed to create a new millionaire every month. Can it really do that? Let’s dive in.</p>
<h2>What is the MillionaireGame?</h2>
<p>The MillionaireGame is a community-driven cryptocurrency project that sets the bold aim of “minting a crypto millionaire through smart contracts every month.”</p>
<p>In essence, the game works through a smart contract that’s provably fair, according to the official website, and the process of picking the winner is fully automated and auditable. The winner is chosen at random, but there’s one constant &#8211; it’s always one of the eligible $MG (the native token of the project) holders.</p>
<p>The smart contract is built on Ethereum, taking advantage of the network’s robust infrastructure, as well as a diverse user base and trustworthiness.</p>
<p>There’s also a certain appeal to the $MG and the way the entire ecosystem is being built. With the founder <a href="https://etherscan.io/verifySig/21810" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">revealed as a genuine crypto millionaire</a>, claims that MillionaireGame was “made by millionaires to create even more millionaires” adds to its convincing appeal.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-27.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-261809" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-27.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="624" height="367" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-27.jpg 624w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-27-300x176.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-27-50x29.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></a></p>
<h2>Necessary Steps and Tokenomics</h2>
<p>The team has also taken a few necessary steps to make sure that the drawing process doesn’t negatively interfere with the tokenomics of $MG. In fact, the website says that it’s estimated that during the game’s operation, the value should increase by some 2% per month while sustaining the tokenomics for a long period in the future.</p>
<p>As per the tokenomics in particular, an estimated 93% of the total supply of $MG will eventually be held by the community. The token supply is capped to 1 billion $MG.</p>
<p>It’s also interesting to note that there is no team pool, which should eliminate concerns of potential dumping on behalf of the team.</p>
<p>In general, the MillionaireGame is designed in a way where it caters to the genuine needs of investors. This is what’s supposed to set it apart from typical meme coins, most of which are just more of the same.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that this is not a lottery &#8211; each month, a token holder will have the chance to become the next crypto millionaire.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-26.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-261808" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-26.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="624" height="416" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-26.jpg 624w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-26-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-26-50x33.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></a></p>
<h2>$MG Presale Ongoing Now</h2>
<p>Early investors have the chance to get in before the public launch of the game &#8211; there’s currently an <a href="https://www.millionairegame.net/claim-discount-55" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ongoing presale</a>.</p>
<p>It’s designed in a modern way with numerous stages. During each stage, the price increases. This encourages early participation. Of course, those take on more risk, but this is directly reflected in the higher potential of return.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that there will be a pre-listing buy-back as well as a post-listing burn. The first round of the buy-back will take place before the listing, and it will allow those who feel more timid to exit. This will also alleviate concerns about quick selling from those who don’t believe in the project’s longer-term vision.</p>
<p>Once the $MG token is listed on exchanges, the repurchased tokens will be burned, allowing the true supporters to share in the rewards.</p>
<p>As the stages progress, the price of $MG is expected to continue increasing throughout the presale event itself.</p>
