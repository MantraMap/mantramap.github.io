<p>Meme coin, stablecoin, or altcoin, which one is the right pick? This is the question that every crypto enthusiast and investor has when it comes to cryptocurrency, and luckily for you, this article has the insight you are looking for.</p>
<p>The three hot picks in terms of investment opportunities for today based on trending news are as follows. Your recommended picks for May include Big Eyes Coin (BIG), Binance Coin (BNB), and Chainlink (LINK).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin: Presale Blowout!</p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin will be ending its presale on June 3rd, and to end things in the best way possible, investors can apply code END300 during checkout, which will grant users an additional 300% of the meme coin. BIG is a cat-themed meme coin with the biggest eyes you ever saw. Don&rsquo;t worry, and it&rsquo;s not the big bad wolf from &ldquo;Little Red Riding Hood&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead, the feline possesses BIG blue eyes similar to Tweety Bird but even cuter. BIG has secured over $35 million during the 13 stages of presale and has been certified and audited by CoinSniper. The Know Your Coin (KYC) certification from CoinSniper adds an extra layer of protection to safeguard against fraud and scams and is a welcomed certification.</p>
<p>BIG has developed a large community following and will be contributing 5% towards ocean-based charities. The Large community also helps ensure the token&rsquo;s success and is now a requirement, as seen by Dogecoin&rsquo;s success. Doge is the current king of the meme coin. However, BIG is a worthy queen to overthrow the king and usher in a new era of profitability.</p>

<p>Bitcoin and Ethereum Fall While Binance Coin Shines</p>
<p>The headline from Yahoo Finance is that Bitcoin (BTC) dropped in value by 2.2% and Ethereum (ETH) by 2.83%. The biggest loser of the day was Solana (SOL), which fell by 4.72%, followed by Litecoin (LTC), which dropped by 3.42% in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>The only resilient stable coin was the Binance Coin which gained 3.71%, increasing its value to $333 and gaining 1.39% over the week. The reason behind the strength of the BNB is introducing the SUI blockchain token to its launch pool. Users can now stake their BNB and TrueUSD (TUSD) to farm SUI.</p>
<p>BNB is currently trading at $324.26 and has seen a 3% drop in the last 24 hours; however, it has gained 2.8 in the previous 30 days. The decline witnessed in the crypto market concerns the unclear rules and regulations regarding crypto.</p>
<p>Chainlink To Ride the Bull&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chainlink has been favoured and is predicted to go on a bull run due to its recent ecosystem expansion. Chainlink shared the news of the ten integrations via Twitter, featuring three services across five unique blockchain protocols. The integration included Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, Solan, and BNB blockchains.</p>
<p>Chainlink is a must-watch oracle power Web 2.0 ecosystem that has secured $7 million in Total Vale Enabled (TVW). Chainlink is known for its lower volatility and is trading at $6.93, with a 1.1% decline in the last 34 hours. Based on its stability and network growth, the token is at a 30-day low of -8.3% and is expected to take off for a bull run.</p>
<p>Picking the right cryptocurrency to invest in can be daunting, but with the right information, investors can make informed decisions. Based on the trending news, the recommended picks for May are Big Eyes Coin (BIG), Binance Coin (BNB), and Chainlink (LINK).&nbsp;</p>
