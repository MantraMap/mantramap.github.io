<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>

<li><em>Bitcoin is trading at a $700 premium on <a href="http://binance.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance.US</a>, offering an arbitrage opportunity for traders.</em></li>

<p>While some attribute the price difference to the departure of market makers, others suggest that it may be due to pending regulatory action. Regardless of the cause, the unusual length of this premium has led to speculation and has impacted funding rates on other exchanges.</p>



<p>To provide some context, the price of one bitcoin is currently $28,000 on global markets, such as Binance&#8217;s global exchange. However, on <a href="http://binance.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance.US</a>, one bitcoin costs $28,300, indicating a $700 premium. This excess cost represents about 2.5% of the bitcoin&#8217;s value, which is not a negligible amount.</p>



<p>As traders try to profit from the difference in Bitcoin price between <a href="http://binance.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance.US</a> and other exchanges, one Twitter user, @fewseethis, speculated that news of incoming regulatory action could have spooked market makers off. &#8220;IF there is some sort of gov action against binance US incoming AND market makers who usually do business there know about it THEN it&#8217;s possible they left and there isn&#8217;t enough liquidity &amp; possibilities for arbitraging are diminished.&#8221; However, the departure of market makers is not the only possible explanation.</p>



<p>Another analyst, @_FabianHD, believes that the departure of market makers doesn&#8217;t explain the phenomenon, stating that &#8220;there doesn&#8217;t seem to be any strong indication that [market makers] are leaving,&#8221; and that &#8220;total assets have been steady throughout the month.&#8221; Conor Ryder from Kaiko Data agrees, citing &#8220;no change in liquidity.&#8221; He suggests that it&#8217;s more likely that the premium is due to a BTC demand issue on an illiquid exchange struggling on the USD side.</p>



<p>Whatever the reason may be, this premium has lasted for four days, which is unusual in itself. This price difference has been impacting funding rates on other exchanges, including Bitmex. It&#8217;s important for traders to take note of this premium and keep an eye on any further developments that may impact the Bitcoin market.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The Aragon Association canceled its plans for holders of its ANT token.</em></li>



<li><em>Its goal is to provide capital to DAO developers.</em></li>



<li><em>The DAO grant programs have played an important role in this field since its inception.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Aragon Association <a href="https://blog.aragon.org/aragon-repurposes-dao-to-ensure-treasury-serves-its-mission/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">halted</a> plans on Tuesday to give holders of its ANT token-wide voting rights over everything from strategic direction to a $200 million treasury, delivering a big setback to the DAO-focused Ethereum startup&#8217;s own transformation to a decentralized autonomous organization.</strong></h5>

<p>Its goal is to provide funding to DAO developers who are creating DAOs, dApps, and plugins on the new tech stack. This will allow builders to get their ideas off the ground quicker on Aragon OSx and Aragon App.</p>



<p>After a 51% attack from activist investors betting on the price of ANT, the Association, a Swiss company that governs the DAO, stated it acted on its fiduciary obligation to preserve its treasury and purpose by repurposing the DAO as part of a new awards program.</p>



<p>The grant programs have played a major role in the sector since their beginning, fostering notable initiatives. Grants may be an important initial step in the development of new ventures.</p>



<p>This project guarantees that the Aragon treasury is distributed to builders that are furthering the DAO&#8217;s objective of creating tools that enable anybody to experiment with governance at the pace of software.</p>



<p>In related news, in an open letter, crypto investment firm Arca urged DAO creator Aragon to execute buybacks of its ANT token, lending institutional weight to the activist investor controversy presently besieging the crypto governance company.</p>



<p>Their spat exploded last week when Aragon banned at least a half-dozen Discord users, including Woodard, on the grounds that they were rabble-rousers rather than genuine community members. In his letter, Woodard disputed that portrayal, claiming that the inquiries he had been asking for months wanted clarity, not problems, regarding finances.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Lido-DAO-Governance-Holds-Onto-39-ETH-Despite-Sushi-Recovery-Effort.webp"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="769" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Lido-DAO-Governance-Holds-Onto-39-ETH-Despite-Sushi-Recovery-Effort-1024x769.webp" alt="Lido DAO Governance Holds Onto 39 ETH Despite Sushi Recovery Effort" class="wp-image-186424" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Lido-DAO-Governance-Holds-Onto-39-ETH-Despite-Sushi-Recovery-Effort-1024x769.webp 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Lido-DAO-Governance-Holds-Onto-39-ETH-Despite-Sushi-Recovery-Effort-300x225.webp 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Lido-DAO-Governance-Holds-Onto-39-ETH-Despite-Sushi-Recovery-Effort-768x577.webp 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Lido-DAO-Governance-Holds-Onto-39-ETH-Despite-Sushi-Recovery-Effort-750x564.webp 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Lido-DAO-Governance-Holds-Onto-39-ETH-Despite-Sushi-Recovery-Effort.webp 1102w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Lido DAO Governance Holds Onto 39 ETH Despite Sushi Recovery Effort 8"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The majority of the lost funds were attributed to Michael Patryn, otherwise known as Omar Dhanani, who is an alleged serial scammer and a co-founder of QuadrigaCX, which is now bankrupt.</p>



<p>It is worth noting that more than 885 ether has already been returned, but a portion of the lost funds, roughly 39.8 ETH, that was redirected to the Lido execution rewards vault had yet to be recovered as of publication.</p>



<p>To address this, a proposal to return these funds had been flagged with the Lido team, and a related snapshot vote was posted last week. As of publication, an overwhelming majority of Lido community members (99.92%) have voted to take &#8220;no action,&#8221; choosing not to return the funds back to Sifu.</p>



<p>Despite the proposal making sense on the surface level, Misha Putiatin, the CEO of Statemind, noted on a discussion thread that there could be severe ramifications to the protocol if it were to be approved. He pointed out that without a clear framework, Lido DAO could be heavily throttled by an inflow of hack reimbursement proposals. In case of reimbursement, Lido DAO would need to be an arbitrary judge of what constitutes legal or illegal activity for other protocols which is way beyond its usual capacity and might bring unpredictable legal risks.</p>



<p>Pseudonymous user Hasu, a strategy adviser for Lido, also weighed in on the issue, noting that the outcome will likely have significant consequences for Lido&#8217;s future decision-making. Hasu opined that whatever Lido DAO governors decide will not affect the case of Sushi primarily, but it will create a precedent that will henceforth act as a policy, whether they like it or not. As such, he proposed that Lido never act as an arbitrator between stakers, node operators, and third parties to avoid similar issues in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>PayPal customers&#8217; crypto deposits rose to $943M, up 56% from the previous quarter according to its latest Q1 2023 SEC filing. </em></li>



<li><em>Bitcoin was the most popular, with a 71% increase quarter-over-quarter, followed by Ethereum and &#8220;Other&#8221; (Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin). </em></li>



<li><em>The total crypto market cap saw a 49% increase from $796B to $1,183B between December 31st, 2022 and March 31st, 2023, indicating a partial recovery.</em></li>

<p>This is a significant increase from the prior quarter, where customers&#8217; crypto deposits amounted to $604 million as of December 31st, 2022.</p>



<p>PayPal&#8217;s cryptocurrency services enable users in certain regions to buy, hold, sell, and pay for purchases using cryptocurrencies. However, the company doesn&#8217;t have any cryptocurrencies on its balance sheet other than those belonging to its customers. Given the increasing interest in cryptocurrencies, this latest surge in customer holdings suggests a growing trend in the adoption of digital currencies.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Capture-3-2.webp"><img decoding="async" width="968" height="152" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Capture-3-2.webp" alt="In its latest Q1 2023 SEC filing, PayPal announced that it has seen a 56% increase in customers&#039; crypto assets, which now amount to $943 million.

<p>The table below shows Bitcoin was the most popular cryptocurrency in terms of current holdings and quarter-over-quarter percentage increase. It spiked by 71% to just short of half a billion dollars. This indicates that Bitcoin is still the most popular cryptocurrency among PayPal&#8217;s customers, as it is with many other investors worldwide.</p>



<p>The second-most held cryptocurrency, Ethereum, saw a 45% increase in deposits. Meanwhile, &#8220;Other,&#8221; consisting of Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin, saw gains of plus 30%. Ethereum&#8217;s popularity among PayPal&#8217;s customers is likely due to its wider adoption among businesses and developers, as well as its ability to facilitate smart contracts and decentralized applications.</p>



<p>PayPal stated that the risks of accounting for cryptocurrency, including &#8220;technological, legal, and regulatory risks,&#8221; meant crypto assets are recorded as both a liability and an asset on their books. This highlights the importance of risk management in the cryptocurrency industry, where the regulatory landscape is still evolving.</p>



<p>Last year was a tumultuous one for cryptocurrency, characterized by CeFi bankruptcies, particularly the FTX scandal. Nonetheless, by the first quarter of 2023, the total crypto market cap saw a significant increase of 49%, rising from $796 billion on December 31st, 2022, to $1,183 billion on March 31st, 2023 – suggesting the market has recovered to a degree.</p>



<p>Without a detailed breakdown of PayPal customers&#8217; holdings, it is unclear precisely how much of the 56% quarter-over-quarter increase in deposits relates to increased crypto holdings or the increase in dollar value over that period. However, using the crude measure of a 49% increase in total market cap between quarters, it is probable that the majority of the increase relates to an increase in the dollar value of holdings – rather than a jump in customers&#8217; deposits. The continued growth of the cryptocurrency market, combined with PayPal&#8217;s increasing adoption of digital currencies, highlights the ongoing evolution of the financial industry towards a more digital, decentralized future.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>LMWR raised over $16M for its blockchain-focused revival.</em></li>



<li><em>LMWR surpassed its $15M funding goal and is over half-way to its $30M fundraising limit.</em></li>



<li><em>LMWR&#8217;s revived version is a platform for music artists to create content on blockchain-based content.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Limewire announced that it had raised over $16 million for its revived platform through sales of its cryptocurrency token (LMWR). </strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Limewire.jpeg"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="346" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Limewire.jpeg" alt="Limewire" class="wp-image-186406" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Limewire.jpeg 640w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Limewire-300x162.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" title="Limewire&#039;s Blockchain Comeback: $16M in Funding Secured 15"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The company successfully surpassed its initial funding goal of $15 million and is on its way towards its $30 million fundraising limit.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> With over $16M raised between our private and public rounds, there are now 48 hours left to participate in the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LMWR?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#LMWR</a> Public Sale.<br><br>You can purchase on <a href="https://t.co/Q5JjPgfMmn" target="_blank">https://t.co/Q5JjPgfMmn</a> before the sale closes on May 11th.<br><br>Exchange listings on May 16th. Announcements coming soon! <a href="https://t.co/KnDKXh5VXd" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/KnDKXh5VXd</a></p>&mdash; LimeWire (@limewire) <a href="https://twitter.com/limewire/status/1655970110304145409?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 9, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The project&#8217;s website also revealed that the sale will end on May 11 and that the LMWR token will be listed on four major exchanges starting on May 16. In order to raise funds, Limewire accepted both fiat and cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), USD Coin (USDC), Tether (USD), and Binance Coin (BNB). During the week of May 6, LMWR added support for XRP, Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC) payments.</p>



<p>Limewire rose to fame as a file-sharing service active in the early 2000s. However, the platform became notorious for enabling copyright infringement of music and subsequently faced legal challenges from the recording industry. Limewire was eventually forced to shut down around 2010.</p>



<p>Despite its past, LMWR&#8217;s revived version is now focused on serving as a platform for music artists. Creators will be able to generate blockchain-based content, which they can monetize with cryptocurrency rewards, payments, and subscriptions. Additionally, all content on the platform will be stored and traded as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), allowing creators to offer their fans unique digital items and experiences.</p>



<p>Limewire evolve from a controversial file-sharing service to a platform that supports the artistic community and the emerging world of NFTs. With Limewire&#8217;s diverse range of accepted payment options and the potential for unique NFT offerings from creators, it is no wonder that the platform has already surpassed its initial fundraising goal.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Flare, an EVM-based Layer 1 blockchain, aims to extend the utility of blockchains by providing decentralized access services to high-integrity data from other chains and Web2. Let&#8217;s take a closer look at what the Flare Network is, how it works, its key features, tokens, and mission.</strong></h5>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is Flare Network?</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-371.png"><img decoding="async" width="1170" height="607" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-371.png" alt="Flare Network Review: Blockchain Using EVM With Breakthrough Potential" class="wp-image-186390" title="Flare Network Review: Blockchain Using EVM With Breakthrough Potential 18"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The <a href="https://news.coincu.com/159122-flare-network-has-officially-launched/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flare Network</a> is an interoperable Layer 1 proof-of-stake blockchain, using the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM). Flare (FLR) was created in 2020. Basically the EVM converts smart contracts into instructions that a computer can read. This allows the network to run Turing-complete smart contracts. Turing-completeness means that it can run almost any computational task, as long as there is enough memory to run it.</p>



<p>It can combine several powerful properties to create an ecosystem of decentralized applications. In a nutshell, Flare aims to bring smart contracts and interoperability to blockchains.</p>



<p>The Ripple blockchain powered by XRP is one of the main goals and inspirations of the Flare Network. Flare proposes to scale PoS blockchains without compromising their security. It does this by ensuring that the security of the network is not tied only to its native tokens, as is the case with most, if not all, PoS networks.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Who is behind Flare Networks?</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-370.png"><img decoding="async" width="900" height="390" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-370.png" alt="Flare Network Review: Blockchain Using EVM With Breakthrough Potential" class="wp-image-186389" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-370.png 900w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-370-300x130.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-370-768x333.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-370-750x325.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" title="Flare Network Review: Blockchain Using EVM With Breakthrough Potential 19"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Flare Network&#8217;s CEO and co-founder is Hugo Philion. Before creating Flare, he was the founder of the modular building system, Future Generations. His expertise is in investing and he holds a Bachelor of Science in Investment and Financial Risk Management from Cass Business School.</p>



<p>He later received a Master of Science in Machine Learning from UCL. He also has experience working as a commodity derivatives portfolio manager at two funds valued at over $1 billion.</p>



<p>Sean Rowan is the second co-founder and CTO of Flare. Sean has been active in the blockchain community since he and colleagues at UCLA and TCD developed safe communication protocols for automobiles that use blockchain-based public key infrastructure in 2015. Prior to that, he graduated from Trinity College Dublin with a combined BA in Mathematics and a BE in Electronic and Computer Engineering.</p>



<p>Then he continued on to University College London to acquire a Master of Science in Machine Learning, most likely where he first met Hugo Philion. Additionally, Sean worked as an R&amp;D Engineer at RAIL in Dublin, Ireland, where he created backend networking software for robot medical assistants. In November 2019, TIME magazine&#8217;s cover showed the most recent iteration of this robot from RAIL.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">How does Flare Network work?</h2>



<p>The Flare Network acts as a Turing Complete Byzantine Agreement Network, using the Flare Consensus Protocol. Turing complete means that the Flare network can run Turing complete smart contracts, which can emulate any computer algorithm. This makes it easier for any developer or computer using any coding language to run smart contracts on the network.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Flare uses the Ethereum Virtual Machine to deploy this smart contract. EVM makes it easier for Ethereum developers to build applications on Flare.</p>



<p>To promote interoperability between different blockchains, the Flare network uses two protocols. The first is a State Connector and the second is an Oracle Time Series Outbreak (FTSO). State Connectors help collect external data from other blockchains. This data is processed on-chain to provide consensus on the state of any blockchain Flare connects to.</p>



<p>That way, the Flare Network can recreate whatever is happening on the blockchain it connects to. On the other hand, Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSO) enables decentralized time series data collection. They are collected over a consistent period of time across other blockchains. Data can include things like data metrics, asset prices, and more.</p>



<p>The Flare network can communicate and exchange data across multiple blockchains through both protocols. This promotes interoperability, especially in building and using applications across different networks.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Features of Flare Network</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)</strong></h3>



<p>Software that aids in deploying and executing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain is known as the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Additionally, it offers a setting in which programmers may create decentralized apps (DApps) on the network. EVM performs a comparable function in Flare Network by hosting DApps and executing smart contracts. Because of this, Ethereum developers may profit from the network.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Flare State Connector Protocol</strong></h3>



<p>A smart contract called the Flare State Connector protocol enables the Flare Network to gather information from any linked blockchain. By utilizing separate attestation providers, it does this in a decentralized and safe manner. These service providers independently glean information from a relevant blockchain. When there is adequate agreement, The Flare Network releases this information.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Oracle Protocol Outbreak Time Series (FTSO)</strong></h3>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-368.png"><img decoding="async" width="804" height="318" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-368.png" alt="Flare Network Review: Blockchain Using EVM With Breakthrough Potential" class="wp-image-186385" title="Flare Network Review: Blockchain Using EVM With Breakthrough Potential 20"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">FTSO workflow </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Flare Time Series Oracle Protocol (FTSO) is another cross-chain data collection and authentication feature on the Flare Network. In contrast to Stateful Connection Protocol, FTSO collects time-specific data. FTSO uses independent data providers to ensure data collection is decentralized and secure. Time-specific data can come from places like cryptocurrency exchanges. It is then automatically weighted depending on the information provider&#8217;s voting power. The average is calculated to give an estimate that can be used on Flare after the data is weighted.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Songbird</strong></h3>



<p>Songbird is Flare&#8217;s &#8216;Canary&#8217; network. This is a test/test net with the exact same features and functionality as Flare. Here, independent developers and teams from Flare can perform real tests on the test network. They do this to see how their changes will affect the Flare network. This makes it easier and more secure to test and deploy the proposed changes without the risk of jeopardizing the main network.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">FLR token</h2>



<p>FLR is the native token of Flare Network. Its basic use case is similar to other native tokens – to prevent spam attacks. If transactions were free, then spamming and clogging the network with useless transactions would also be free.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is the FLR token used for?</strong></h3>



<p>FLR can be used for the following functions:</p>



<ul>
<li>As collateral in decentralized applications (DApps)</li>



<li>To provide data to an on-chain oracle</li>



<li>Participate in protocol governance</li>
</ul>



<p>These three components aim to enable an ecosystem of Spark-based applications called Spark Dependent Applications (SDA). SDA may also allow for unreliable representation of tokens on other networks. Even networks that don&#8217;t support smart contracts.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Token Allocation</strong></h3>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-369.png"><img decoding="async" width="1622" height="672" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-369.png" alt="Flare Network Review: Blockchain Using EVM With Breakthrough Potential" class="wp-image-186388" title="Flare Network Review: Blockchain Using EVM With Breakthrough Potential 21"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Initial token distribution: Macro view of total FLR allocation</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>There are 100 billion FLR tokens available for distribution among the network&#8217;s key stakeholders. 58% of tokens will go to Flare community through airdrops. Then, 19% is allocated to the development team, advocates and advisors. Finally, Flare spends 22.5% of its tokens on investment and product development.</p>



<p>The first token distribution event was scheduled for 2020. Due to the aforementioned Ripple lawsuit, the first airdrop instead happened during a token distribution event on May 9th. 1, 2023. Eligible XRP holders received 4.28 billion FLR through centralized exchanges like Binance, Kraken, Kucoin, and OKX.</p>



<p>The 4.28 billion FLR airdrop represents 15% of the tokens allocated to the community. The remaining 85% of tokens will be distributed depending on the votes of current holders who are expected to wrap their FLR tokens.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Pros and Cons</h2>



<p>The first advantage of the Flare network is its ability to make blockchains interoperable. This is an advantage for blockchain developers and users when trading; Flare&#8217;s technology allows the transfer of information between multiple blockchains.</p>



<p>Second, Flare networks help PoS blockchains grow without jeopardizing their security. Flare supports this by allowing smart contract platforms to scale without just linking the security of the network to their native token. The network also provides an environment to build DApps without worrying about code incompatibilities due to Turing completion. Finally, by integrating the Ethereum Virtual Machine, Flare continues to act to scale the smart contract network.</p>



<p>Although there are many advantages, there are still some disadvantages to the network. The main and biggest limitation is Flare&#8217;s dependence on the Ripple network. The network delayed its launch and broadcast for two years due to Ripple&#8217;s lawsuit. The network will be at a disadvantage in the long run if it continues to be profoundly affected by the functions of a blockchain.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Overall, Flare Network is a layer 1 blockchain ecosystem and decentralized oracle network. The protocol incorporates a unique stack and token generation system built to enable programmability and cross-chain communication. The goal of the project is to enable HODLer to unlock liquidity and expand DeFi adoption.</p>



<p>There are many benefits obtained by Flare users. Firstly, the network improves interoperability across the entire market which improves liquidity. Users can gain access to DeFi features with deep liquidity pool by using Flare. This structure also supports scalable EVM-based smart contracts, which makes it an ideal solution for Ethereum developers looking for lower fees.</p>



<p>Another thing to remember is that Flare started with Ripple, but it could theoretically add smart contract functionality and interoperability to any blockchain. Considering that three-quarters of the value in public blockchain tokens cannot be used with smart contracts in a trustless manner, Flare currently has a huge potential growth curve ahead.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Marathon Digital Holdings and Zero Two have unveiled a new mining operation in the Middle East.</em></li>



<li><em>The operation&#8217;s initial mining location will be in Abu Dhabi&#8217;s Masdar City.</em></li>



<li><em>The second mining location will be in Mina Zayed, Abu Dhabi&#8217;s harbor district.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Marathon Digital <a href="https://ir.marathondh.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1312/marathon-digital-holdings-and-zero-two-to-develop-and" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> on May 9 that the joint venture would be situated in Mina Zayed and Masdar City in the United Arab Emirates, with two mining sites totaling 250 megawatts.</p>



<p>The bigger 200MW facility will be built in Abu Dhabi&#8217;s sustainability center, Masdar City, while the smaller 50MW plant will be located in the Mina Zayed port zone.</p>



<p>Marathon and Zero Two want to power the facilities using extra energy from Abu Dhabi&#8217;s grid, saying that this will boost base load and sustainability.</p>



<p>The Middle Eastern alliance comes as the White House campaigns for a new levy that would require crypto miners in the nation to pay 30% of their energy bills.</p>



<p>Zero Two will hold 80% of the ADGM Entity, while Marathon will possess 20%. The mining operation is anticipated to receive $406 million in capital expenditure throughout the development period of 2023. These gifts will include both financial and in-kind contributions. Marathon and Zero Two have already purchased equipment and infrastructure.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-375.png"><img decoding="async" width="1200" height="759" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-375.png" alt="Marathon To Launch 250-megawatt Capacity Mining Operation In Abu Dhabi" class="wp-image-186397" title="Marathon To Launch 250-megawatt Capacity Mining Operation In Abu Dhabi 25"></a></figure></div>


<p>The digital assets mined by the ADGM Entity will be distributed twice each month and in line with Zero Two and Marathon&#8217;s equity ownership, respectively.</p>



<p>The companies said that they launched a pilot operation in Abu Dhabi to explore the feasibility of immersion mining. In hot areas, immersion mining, which includes immersing mining gear in a liquid coolant, is challenging. Nonetheless, two businesses were able to develop their own immersion solution and discovered that this strategy was practical.</p>



<p>The news of the prospective mining facility comes as officials from the US-based crypto exchange Coinbase visit the UAE to assess the region&#8217;s potential as a strategic hub for its worldwide operations.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>OKX sends $60M to bankrupt Alameda Research wallet in 16 transactions.</em></li>



<li><em>Alameda Research&#8217;s wallet holds $285.86M in crypto assets.</em></li>



<li><em>FTX creditors try to recover assets, while speculation surrounds FTX&#8217;s relaunch.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to data from Arkham Intelligence, OKX sent over $60 million worth of crypto assets to the wallet of bankrupt Alameda Research in the last five hours. </strong></h5>

<p>This was accomplished through 16 transactions, which included 10 deposits of $5 million USDT and 337,859 MASK (roughly $1.30 million). It&#8217;s worth noting that OKX has promised to cooperate with FTX debtors and law enforcement officials to return any funds linked to the bankrupt firm on its platform.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-09-145538.jpeg"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="488" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-09-145538-1024x488.jpeg" alt="Screenshot 2023 05 09 145538" class="wp-image-186386" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-09-145538-1024x488.jpeg 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-09-145538-300x143.jpeg 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-09-145538-768x366.jpeg 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-09-145538-750x358.jpeg 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-09-145538-1140x544.jpeg 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-09-145538.jpeg 1516w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="OKX Transfers Whopping $60M To Alameda&#039;s Crypto Wallet 29"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Source: Arkham Intelligence</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Moreover, during the last seven days, the Alameda wallet has received over 1 million Stargate tokens (STG) and over 5 billion units of the GPEPE meme coin from an unknown wallet. This is quite interesting considering that Alameda&#8217;s largest crypto holding was $61.40 million USDT, with other top holdings being 100 million BitDAO tokens worth $48.61 million, 19,292 Ethereum (ETH) worth $26.5 million, $12.35 million USDC, 28.9 million Stargate tokens worth $18.43 million, and 16.39 million Polygon tokens worth $14.63 million. The firm also holds altcoins like Lido (LDO), FTX Token (FTT), Serum (SRM), among others. Overall, its crypto assets are worth $285.86 million.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that FTX creditors have continued efforts to recover the exchange’s assets. The bankrupt firm has moved to claw back $3.9 billion from Genesis and has been involved in selling several assets belonging to the company.</p>



<p>There is increased speculation that suggests the possibility of FTX restarting operations. A recent court filing confirmed plans to restart FTX’s Japanese subsidiary.</p>

<p>The macro backdrop has changed little in the past few weeks, but market watchers will be focusing on “Binance and whether people are seriously storing cryptos in cold wallets,” according to Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange Oanda, in a <a href="https://www.marketpulse.com/newsfeed/oil-gets-bullish-alongside-gold-bitcoin-wavers/emoya" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tuesday note</a>.</p>



<p>As for Bitcoin, it appears to be stuck in a trading range, but if we have a de-risking moment on Wall Street, that will be enough to send cryptos toward the lows seen in mid-March, Moya wrote. Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, was off roughly 0.4% on Tuesday to change hands at around $1,844. Despite this, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) jumped over 9% for the day to trade at around $121.29, while Lido&#8217;s governance token (LDO) recently rose by 6% to $1.85.</p>



<p>As measured by the Market Index (CMI), the overall crypto market performance was up roughly half a percentage point for the day. However, equity markets turned mixed ahead of Wednesday’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) for April, with the S&amp;P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closing down 0.4% and 0.6%, respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) slid 0.1%.</p>



<p>In bond markets, the note on the 2-year Treasury yield rose 2 basis points to sit around 4.02%, while the 10-year Treasury yield remained almost flat from Monday, same time, to reach 3.52%.</p>



<p>Investors across the board will be watching the CPI for clues about how the U.S. Federal Reserve will act at its next policy meeting in June. The Fed approved a 25 basis points (bps) increase earlier this month to push the Federal Funds rate to its highest level in 16 years. This development has sparked debate about how the economy will develop in the coming months, with some analysts predicting a strong rebound while others are more cautious. As such, there is a great deal of uncertainly at present, and investors are keeping a close eye on the latest developments to inform their decision-making.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Transactions on the Litecoin network have reached all-time highs as a result of the meme coin craze.</em></li>



<li><em>The consequent high costs on the Bitcoin network sent crypto users seeking for alternatives, contributing to the network&#8217;s rise in transactions.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Litecoin (LTC) has lately seen a large increase in whale transactions.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-366.png"><img decoding="async" width="900" height="506" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-366.png" alt="Litecoin Transactions Surge Over 450% Thanks To BRC-20&#039;s Attraction" class="wp-image-186370" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-366.png 900w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-366-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-366-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-366-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" title="Litecoin Transactions Surge Over 450% Thanks To BRC-20&#039;s Attraction 35"></a></figure></div>


<p>With a 450% rise since early May, this surge in big transactions might be related to the forthcoming release of LTC-20, a significant improvement to the Litecoin ecosystem.</p>



<p>Transactions on the Litecoin blockchain have <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactions-btc-ltc.html#3m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached</a> all-time highs as the meme coin craze and consequent high fees on the Bitcoin network drive crypto consumers to seek alternatives.</p>



<p>According to BitInfoCharts blockchain statistics, Litecoin conducted more than 576,000 transactions in a single day on May 9, approaching Bitcoin&#8217;s 598,000 daily transactions. That is five times the average amount of transactions on the Litecoin blockchain compared to earlier this year, and it is more than twice the previous all-time high around the bull market&#8217;s top in January 2018.</p>

<p>The LTC-20 standard, which has a total supply of 84 million, is being created on top of the Litecoin Ordinals Protocols. The BRC-20 token, an experimental fungible token produced using Ordinals and inscriptions and kept on the Bitcoin base chain, is the goal of this new standard. BRC-20 is a token standard that allows users to generate and transfer tokens over the Bitcoin network using the Ordinals Protocol.</p>



<p>The news comes as the Bitcoin network, which is home to Bitcoin (BTC), the biggest cryptocurrency by market value, is facing high congestion as a result of a flurry of new Bitcoin-based BRC-20 tokens.</p>

<p>The creation of LTC-20 and the BRC-20 tokens is intended to bring considerable innovation and growth to the Litecoin ecosystem, perhaps increasing interest from both retail and institutional investors.</p>



<p>Because of Bitcoin&#8217;s congestion, consumers are looking for cheaper alternatives to transferring value through blockchain, such as stablecoins and the Lightning network.</p>



<p>Litecoin has also seen a surge in activity. According to Glassnode statistics, in addition to a record number of transactions, the number of active wallet addresses reached a new high of 718,000 on Monday. Recently, crypto users produced around 500,000 new addresses in a single day, according to the Litecoin Foundation, citing Glassnode.</p>



<p>The current uptick in Litecoin whale transactions might be attributed to investors awaiting the release of the LTC-20 standard and positioning themselves to profit from any possible price increase after the upgrade. Since the cryptocurrency market often sees price variations as a result of news and events, this spike in whale activity may indicate increased market interest in the imminent LTC-20 release.</p>
