<p>According to data from Glassnode, the Bitcoin network has seen an upsurge in the amount of Bitcoin held by market players. Notably, this uptrend was spotted amongst Bitcoin holders in the United States.</p>



<p>Glassnode asserted that the new development was triggered by BlackRock’s recent announcement concerning its spot Bitcoin ETF application. The new development signals a potential inflection point in the asset’s supply dominance if the trend continues.</p>



<p><em>“Following the Blackrock Bitcoin ETF request announcement on June 15th, the share of Bitcoin supply held/traded by US entities has experienced a notable uptick, marking a potential inflection point in supply dominance if the trend is sustained.”</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Following the Blackrock <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> ETF request announcement on June 15th, the share of Bitcoin supply held/traded by US entities has experienced a notable uptick, marking a potential inflection point in supply dominance if the trend is sustained. <a href="https://t.co/DvRCYB4BUF">pic.twitter.com/DvRCYB4BUF</a></p>&mdash; glassnode (@glassnode) <a href="https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1677637186559135745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 8, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The price of Bitcoin could also benefit from the success of the Bitcoin ETF request, as it will become the first spot Bitcoin ETF in the country. </p>



<p>In a recent interview with Fox News, Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, made some <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-holds-above-31k-as-blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-lauds-bitcoin-for-digitizing-gold/">bullish remarks about Bitcoin</a>, as he explained that the asset is pioneering the digitalization of gold differently.</p>



<p><em>“I do believe the role of crypto is [that] it’s digitizing gold in many ways. Instead of investing in gold as a hedge against inflation, as hedge against the onerous problems of any country, or the devaluation of your currency.. let’s be clear: Bitcoin is an international asset, it’s not based on any one currency, and so it can represent an asset that people can play as an alternative.” Fink asserted.</em></p>



<p>Sentiments around BlackRock&#8217;s spot Bitcoin ETF filing are mixed at this time. While some market participants are positive that the ETF proposal by the $10 trillion asset manager could usher in more institutional investors, others insist that the ETF poses a more significant risk to the Bitcoin market.</p>



<p>Notably, Cathie Wood, the CEO of Ark Invest, stated that the SEC would likely reject BlackRock’s ETF proposal. Speaking to Fortune Crypto in a recent interview, Wood is <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/07/06/we-dont-think-thats-true-cathie-wood-says-blackrock-doesnt-have-an-edge-when-it-comes-to-sec-approval-for-a-spot-bitcoin-etf/amp/">quoted</a> saying; </p>



<p><em>“We [Ark Invest] know that there was a surveillance clause in their prospectus that ours didn’t include, but what I’m told is it won’t take much time for us to amend our prospectus, and that all of the exchanges are moving in this direction.”</em></p>



<p>At report time, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoins-correlation-with-traditional-markets-and-gold-diminishes-heres-why/">Bitcoin</a> is trading for $30,274. After clearing hourly losses, Bitcoin seems to be positioning itself for a comeback. The apex cryptocurrency could retest its recent high of $30,403 in the near term.</p>

<p>Dr Gavin Wood, the creator of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/uniswaps-groundbreaking-decision-expanding-business-to-polkadot-via-moonbeam-parachain/">Polkadot</a>, made a ground-breaking revelation about his ambitious aspirations to build a global supercomputer on the Polkadot network. The announcement was made during the recent Polkadot Decoded conference when Wood highlighted the vast potential of Polkadot and outlined its key features.</p>



<p>Because of the scattered and incompatible nature of the current internet infrastructure, Wood sees Polkadot as a worldwide supercomputer. He asserts that a decentralized network with seamless data sharing and connectivity between various blockchains and networks is what the future holds.</p>



<p>Wood emphasized the need for a platform to unite specialized blockchains into one cohesive network. He stated, <em>&#8220;Polkadot aims to create a scalable and interoperable platform where different blockchains can communicate and share information, essentially creating a global supercomputer.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Several crucial aspects could help Polkadot take over the market. To begin with, its distinctive architecture enables the effortless movement of any data or asset across several blockchains.</p>



<p>Polkadot emphasizes the underlying resources needed to communicate and interact between chains rather than concentrating simply on chains. Polkadot is a platform for developers to create applications for people, not simply a platform for hosting chains, according to Wood.</p>



<p>And then, of course, the resilience of Polkadot is a key feature. Even though the word &#8220;unstoppable&#8221; has been used to characterize blockchain networks, Wood thinks the word &#8220;resilience&#8221; is more accurate and better describes Polkadot&#8217;s capacity to withstand attempts to interfere with how it is supposed to work. Polkadot ensures the network&#8217;s integrity by offering resilience against the corruption of purpose.</p>



<p>In a broader sense, Polkadot functions as a provider of highly resilient general-purpose computation. Wood compares it to a modern multicore computer, where each core runs separately and simultaneously. These cores, referred to as parachains, operate on Polkadot constantly. He revealed plans to go from a roughly 50-core CPU to 500 or even 1000 cores, giving the network more computational power.  </p>



<p>Polkadot&#8217;s cores have characteristics in common with central processing units (CPUs), including bandwidth, compute power and latency. The quantity of data processed per second, or bandwidth, is now believed to be around 1 MB. The Geekbench 5 benchmark rates a core&#8217;s processing power at about 380. Additionally, there is a 6-second lag between each subsequent chunk of work.</p>



<p>Polkadot&#8217;s promise, meanwhile, goes beyond holding parachains in place. Wood considers the feasibility of directly executing smart contracts on Polkadot cores. Although this implementation is not immediately available, it highlights how flexible and all-encompassing Polkadot&#8217;s computational capabilities are. Developers may run complex logic and keep a lot of state by utilizing Polkadot&#8217;s cores&#8217; power and bandwidth, outperforming the limitations of conventional smart contract platforms.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Polkadot uses a relay chain and parachains structure to guarantee excellent scalability and security. Parallel processing and higher transaction throughput are made possible via parachains, which are separate chains that link to the primary relay chain. Thanks to this design, Polkadot can manage many transactions at once, making it appropriate for enterprise-level applications.</p>



<p>Additionally, the governance structure of Polkadot is intended to be open and democratic. It makes the platform fair and inclusive by enabling token holders to participate in decision-making. This decentralized governance strategy complies with blockchain technology&#8217;s guiding principles and offers a robust and secure framework for developing the Internet.</p>



<p>Dr Gavin Wood has further cemented Polkadot&#8217;s reputation as a pioneer in the blockchain sector by revealing the platform&#8217;s concept for a global supercomputer. The blockchain ecosystem is a strong candidate for the future of decentralized apps and services due to its distinctive architecture, scalability, and democratic governance approach. Polkadot&#8217;s concept has the potential to transform the internet as we know it and bring in a new era of frictionless communication and cooperation across blockchains and networks as the world progresses toward a more connected future.</p>

<p>Bitcoin has continued to show impressive strength, recovering roughly 100% year to date. In the past week alone, the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization has grown by over 17%, perching above $30,000.</p>



<p>This growth comes from improving metrics, particularly from small-scale investors who have been demonstrating remarkable conviction and commitment by steadily growing their holdings, even in the face of the cryptocurrency market&#8217;s volatility and regulatory challenges.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, Glassnode&#8217;s lead analyst, &#8220;Checkmate&#8221;, sheds light on the significant impact these smaller investors are making in the market. In a tweet, the pundit highlighted <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-shrimps-and-crabs-increase-holdings-by-almost-1-million-btc-amid-price-drop/">Bitcoin shrimps</a>, or addresses holding less than 1BTC, noting that they have been stacking sats at an impressive rate of 33.8k BTC monthly. According to the pundit&#8217;s analysis, for every new coin entering the market, shrimps are acquiring 1.25 BTC, effectively reducing the available supply.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;The last time the little guy stacked this hard was 2017 ATH, buying the top. Five years later, they are stacking harder, faster, and in a more sustained manner, despite all the bullshit. Bullish,&#8221;</em> the pundit wrote, attributing the purchases to the <em>&#8220;success of Bitcoin education visualized via on-chain data.&#8221;</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/19zmIYhFMmTJCDF35qpMvVXxns1ZujOvsI-EdJPxe6u5oafBLjLxx_dFhX0gClFQEsllWUvVZEFpApOFvufz8P_M9O3fCo0a8VZ1hd3m8y9c-08S24QQ7XYDJed52WgbiNVD-YRuUOTdbEx6YBmYMg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>On the other hand, Checkmate highlighted the so-called &#8220;Bitcoin crabs&#8221;, or investors who hold between 1 and 10 BTC. According to the pundit, this cohort has also aggressively accumulated coins, with a monthly rate of 22,400 BTC.</p>



<p>Remarkably, this accumulation represents an additional 83% of the mined supply, further emphasizing their growing influence in the market. The commitment these entities show, considering their higher investment range, highlights their belief in the long-term value of Bitcoin.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/G0GFfcuiXhlz5XbsBwWFdb6E5Jx7P2RfjdvnHWrgwDZpSMbJudf86d8IOVqKFeFKfV_RI5WZV9nkvD7KskBwWtFNIwPheJhXwLfMs_KRDKYnvZIB7zoDNKSSxLg3zNIpieDJBAb4cx3jKUdbgRneDg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Notably, while Bitcoin shrimps and crabs persist in accumulating coins, a striking contrast can be observed with the behaviour of Bitcoin whales (entities holding 1000-5000 BTC) and humpbacks (entities holding over 5000 BTC), who have been distributing their coins over the past eight years or so.</p>



<p>That said, the increased <a href="https://zycrypto.com/blackrock-highly-optimistic-on-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval-as-ceo-larry-fink-terms-bitcoin-an-international-asset/">institutional interest</a> in Bitcoin has significantly motivated shrimps and crabs to accumulate coins aggressively. The recognition and adoption of Bitcoin by mainstream institutions such as Fidelity and Blackrock, as well as major banks, have sparked confidence among smaller investors, who see the potential for substantial returns and a hedge against traditional financial risks.</p>



<p>At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $30,276 after surging just over 2% in the past 24 hours. </p>

<p>Shytoshi Kusama, the anonymous lead developer for Shiba Inu, has revealed an ambitious vision to create a more decentralized and long-lasting community for SHIB.</p>



<p>In a Thursday blog titled &#8220;Long Live Shivainu!,&#8221; Kusama shared insights into the project&#8217;s progress and outlined the path ahead. Kusama started by acknowledging the initial question that sparked this endeavour, <em>&#8220;Is it possible to build a leaderless, 100% decentralized, autonomous, persistent community?&#8221;</em></p>



<p>While many projects have attempted similar goals, Kusama emphasized that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-unlocks-remarkable-price-trajectory-amid-exciting-ecosystem-updates-for-shibarium/">Shiba Inu</a> has surpassed expectations and become one of the most successful projects. However, the pundit stressed the importance of achieving true permanence, going beyond mere decentralization, and ensuring a robust foundation for the community. To fulfil the original vision of Shib&#8217;s founder, Ryoshi, Kusama proposed an update that adds intent and expands on the concept of a decentralized and enduring community.</p>



<p>In his view, establishing a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is fundamental to realising this vision. A DAO is a blockchain-based organization that operates without a central authority. Kusama proposed wrapping the existing &#8220;Shiba Doggy DAO&#8221; with the Cayman Foundation in the blog.</p>



<p>With the emergence of DAOs in the past three or so years, the need for a legal framework that protects members, safeguards funds, and enables governance has led to the establishment of the so-called DAO legal wrapper. As a result, some jurisdictions, like the Cayman Islands, Singapore, Switzerland and Panama, have emerged as some of the most popular for DAO incorporation due to their progressive pro-crypto laws.</p>



<p>According to Kusama, this move aims to ensure that the DAO&#8217;s decisions are executed by the foundation, guaranteeing the proper management of DAO assets.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Kusama introduced the Doggy DAO(s) concept, which will govern different aspects of the Shiba Inu ecosystem. He revealed that the governance would be divided into four segments, with each core token in the system having its respective governance responsibility. This division ensures equal representation and supports the long-term sustainability of the community.</p>



<p>In other exciting news, the pundit announced Shib&#8217;s sponsorship of the Blockchain Futurist Conference, Eth Toronto, and Eth Women, scheduled to take place in Toronto in August. The event will serve as a platform to showcase completed projects, including the highly anticipated <a href="https://zycrypto.com/0-001-shib-price-looks-nigh-as-shiba-inus-testnet-sees-rising-activity-ahead-of-shibarium-mainnet/">Shibarium network</a>.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;At this location, the completed World paper will be exhibited, all Shib branded projects will be published, and Treat will be published in detail for the first time.&nbsp;In addition, it is very likely that we will also discuss and release the L2 Shibarium that we have been waiting for</em>,&#8221; wrote Kusama.</p>



<p>That said, following Kusama&#8217;s reveal, it will be interesting to see how SHIB&#8217;s vision for a decentralized community proceeds to fruition even as the ecosystem enters an exciting implementation phase, showcasing its unwavering commitment to revolutionize the cryptocurrency landscape.</p>

<p>In a recent report by Bank of America, the role of Ripple in the payments industry, especially in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, has been hailed by the second-largest bank in the United States. A team of analysts from the bank is unabashedly bullish on the company’s tech.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bank-of-america-endorses-ripple-as-a-possible-exception"><strong>Bank Of America Endorses Ripple As A “Possible Exception”</strong></h2>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://business.bofa.com/content/dam/flagship/global-transaction-services/treasury-innovations-outlook/payments-innovation-in-apac.pdf">report </a>by Bank of America entitled “Breaking New Ground: Harnessing Payments Innovation in APAC”, the bank highlighted the role of blockchain in digitizing trade documents and the potential of Ripple’s frictionless remittance solutions to transform cross-border payments.</p>



<p>Bank of America acknowledges the evolutionary power of technology in enabling real-time payments. According to the bank’s report, APIs are the primary catalysts for the adoption of real-time payments, and they have revolutionized both customer connectivity and transaction processing. </p>



<p>“Banks can save money by utilizing Ripple’s technology, which is one of the reasons cross-border payments through Ripple have become so well-known. By eliminating middlemen and utilizing blockchain technology, Ripple lowers the transaction costs associated with international payments,” said Bank of America.</p>



<p>The bank dubbed Ripple’s work in the cross-border payments space as a “possible exception”, adding that banking institutions can boost the value and competitiveness of their products by passing down the cost-saving benefits to their customers. Moreover, in a highly competitive market, the decrease in operational costs also improves banks&#8217; overall financial health and profitability.</p>



<p>The Head of Treasury Products APAC at Bank of America, Es Venkat, posited: “We’re already seeing Open Banking become a reality in EMEA, with the API mechanism being used to develop many new use cases.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Did XRP’s Future Just Get A Lot Brighter?</strong></h2>



<p>Ripple Labs has, in the past <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-sees-ultra-bullish-use-cases-after-colombias-central-bank-taps-ripple-to-pilot-cbdc/">inked deals </a>with a myriad of financial services providers across the globe. While the recognition by the Bank of America is a big deal, it’s important to note that the majority of financial giants are still not using Ripple’s tech as they are deterred by the company’s legal troubles in the United States. </p>



<p>The San Francisco-based blockchain payments firm has been <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">locked in a courtroom war </a>with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission since 2020 over the allegation it broke federal securities laws by selling the XRP cryptocurrency to retail consumers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If Ripple’s tech achieves widespread adoption after it&#8217;s incorporated into the existing traditional financial infrastructure, it will result in tremendous changes to the global payments ecosystem.  </p>



<p>As for the XRP price, the bears have held off any attempts by the bulls to drive the price of crypto higher despite <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-lawsuit-sec-has-a-3-chance-of-winning-says-lawyer-predicts-xrp-victory-surge-to-10-price/">increasing hopes of a favorable outcome for Ripple</a> in its ongoing SEC lawsuit. The sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap was trading around $0.4674 at publication time, plummeting 0.9% over the last day, per CoinGecko. Whether XRP will embark on a new journey north soon remains anyone&#8217;s guess.</p>

<p>Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes thinks that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/blackrocks-renewed-bitcoin-etf-application-featuring-coinbase-raises-questions-on-secs-scrutiny/">Bitcoin</a> will become the native currency of AI-powered economies and hit over $750,000 in the process. Hayes’s rationale is hinged on the benchmark cryptocurrency’s inherent attributes that could make it interoperable with the fast-growing realm of artificial intelligence.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hayes-calls-btc-the-logical-currency-choice-for-ai"><strong>Hayes Calls BTC The “Logical Currency Choice For AI”</strong></h2>



<p>In his latest intriguing piece titled “Massa”, Arthur Hayes has delved into the potential integration of Bitcoin and artificial intelligence (AI).</p>



<p>According to the Thursday <a href="https://cryptohayes.substack.com/p/massa">blog post</a>, the well-known crypto trader suggested that Bitcoin will ascend as the dominant currency for AI. He argued that the premier crypto’s attributes as a purely digital, censorship-resistant, and digitally scarce currency make it the most fitting choice for AIs.</p>



<p>“Bitcoin is thus the logical currency choice for any AI. It is purely digital, censorship-resistant, provably scarce, and its intrinsic value is completely electricity-cost-dependent. There is nothing in existence today that comes close to challenging Bitcoin on these aspects.”</p>



<p>Hayes added that compared to fiat currencies and gold, which don’t have irrefutable value or quantifiability, Bitcoin&#8217;s immutable supply is programmatically capped at 21 million coins, making it a logical choice for any AI looking for a currency that’s reliable and enshrined with “clear and transparent” rules from the outset.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitcoin’s Road To A $760,000 Price Tag</strong></h2>



<p>Where would a possible convergence between Bitcoin and AI leave the top cryptocurrency?</p>



<p>Hayes predicted that Bitcoin could reach a staggering $760,000 per coin on the back of an AI boost.</p>



<p>“If Bitcoin is seen as likely to be — or even starts to be — used by AIs, then we could see two separate manias combine into one mega mania: the mania of wanting to escape inflation within the fiat financial system and the mania of wanting to own a piece of the next phase of human and computer evolution,” Hayes stated. “The overlap of these two manias would likely drive investors to grossly overpay for growth, causing the value of the Bitcoin network to rise to silly levels.”</p>



<p>Arthur Hayes is no stranger to sky-high price forecasts. In April 2022, the industry stalwart explained how Western financial policy&#8217;s “doom loop” would spark <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cathie-wood-sticks-with-1-million-bitcoin-prediction-amid-maelstrom-of-regulatory-crackdowns-heres-why/">Bitcoin’s run to $1 million</a> by 2030.</p>

<p>The correlation between Bitcoin (BTC) and gold, as well as the traditional market continues to be a burning issue.</p>



<p>According to IntoTheBlock, a shift is being witnessed because the connection between BTC and the traditional market continues to decline.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The market insight provider <a href="https://twitter.com/intotheblock/status/1673595342695301122">stated</a>, <em>“Bitcoin Correlation Shift: A month ago, BTC demonstrated an inverse correlation with the stock market and a minor positive link with Gold. Fast forward to today, it’s intriguing to see BTC showing no connection with traditional markets &amp; a negative correlation with gold.”</em></p>

<p>Glassnode, a leading on-chain metrics provider, shared similar sentiments and acknowledged that Bitcoin’s price action was decoupling from both gold and silver. This was because its 30-day correlation with gold stood at lows of -0.78, whereas that of silver hit -0.9.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/373Q-adF5AiT9sqeTaF2CTgTIBK1PbrDC1c26yUbd12e6GwxMcx6L6HlpncLefw6GbtZieYgtI5IiV6H8KLFVeen12TckCGJxndcdLJ9uPfaNxWMabAuOfKT3TCaPnJfoSFR2KstVeJ2LBzr38Z6vi8" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Source: Glassnode</em></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-does-the-declining-correlation-mean"><strong>What Does the Declining Correlation Mean?</strong></h2>



<p>The decoupling of BTC from the stock and traditional market, as well as its negative connection with gold is a welcome move because the leading cryptocurrency is showcasing itself as a different asset class. This might be the case as more big players continue penetrating the Bitcoin market.</p>



<p>Notably, correlation illustrates the tendency of two items to move in a similar or opposite direction after a given period of time.</p>



<p>The comparison between gold and BTC has gained steam over the years, especially when it comes to the issue of being a hedge against inflation or store of value. Bitcoin’s status as an alternative to gold continues to be tested based on its decentralized nature and finite supply.</p>



<p>Previously, Bitcoin showed a strong correlation with the stock market. This was because whenever the stock market experienced a sharp sell-off, BTC followed suit, especially during periods of economic uncertainty, as showcased during the peak of the pandemic in 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, a research report by Bernstein <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-pierces-30000-for-first-time-since-june-as-bernstein-calls-btc-faster-horse-compared-to-gold/">acknowledged</a> that BTC was a ‘faster horse’ than gold. This was after the top cryptocurrency breached the psychological price of $30K for the first time in April since June 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to a recent survey conducted by Binance, a staggering 88% of institutional investors have expressed a bullish outlook for the next decade in the world of cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>The &#8220;Institutional Crypto Outlook Survey&#8221; survey collected responses from 208 Binance institutional clients and VIP users from March 31 to May 15, 2023, providing valuable insights into their attitudes, preferences, adoption, and motivations regarding cryptocurrency investments.</p>



<p>One of the most notable findings is that 63.5% of the respondents expressed a positive outlook for crypto in the next 12 months. However, when looking ahead to the next decade, an overwhelming majority of 88% indicated their positive sentiment, indicating a strong belief in the long-term potential of cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>The survey highlights that 47.1% of institutional investors maintained their crypto allocation over the past year, while 35.6% increased their allocation during the same period. The report noted that 50% of respondents expect to increase their allocation to crypto further, demonstrating a growing confidence in the asset class. Interestingly, only 4.3% of respondents anticipate reducing their crypto allocation in the next 12 months.</p>



<p>Regarding areas of interest, the survey also revealed that institutional investors are particularly focused on infrastructure, with 53.9% of respondents considering it the most important sector for them or their funds.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Infrastructure, L1 and L2 are areas of focus among institutional investors. 53.9% of investors found infrastructure to be the sector of most importance to them or their funds. This was closely followed by L1 and L2 sectors at 48.1% and 43.8%, respectively. In terms of usage, DeFi dApps were the most widely used in recent months,&#8221;</em> the survey <a href="https://research.binance.com/static/pdf/institutional-crypto-outlook-survey-2023.pdf">report</a> noted.</p>



<p>Notably, regulatory risk emerged as the primary concern for institutional investors, followed by counterparty and custody risks for institutional investors. Interestingly, price volatility did not deter the group, with most expressing high comfort levels with cryptocurrency volatility.</p>



<p>However, the survey highlighted that institutional investors believe increased real-world use cases and regulatory clarity will drive cryptocurrency adoption. As the industry matures, these investors foresee a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies in mainstream applications and a more supportive regulatory environment.</p>



<p>The survey comes on the heels of heightened scrutiny over the crypto market, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently filing <a href="https://zycrypto.com/this-is-an-opportunity-to-get-rule-clarity-in-court-coinbase-stresses-on-the-positive-amid-sec-lawsuit/">lawsuits</a> against Binance and Coinbase in its crypto enforcement barrage. However, institutions have remained undeterred, as demonstrated by the numerous Spot Bitcoin ETF filings by prominent firms such as WisdomTree, BlackRock, VanEck, and Fidelity.</p>

<p>Yann Allemann, co-founder of popular crypto on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has expressed optimism about Ethereum&#8217;s future even as the cryptocurrency continues to display resilience in the face of regulatory challenges within the crypto market.</p>



<p>In a tweet on July 5, the pundit highlighted <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ethereums-buterin-voices-sympathy-for-solana-and-other-tokens-targeted-by-sec/">Ethereum&#8217;s</a> recent price action, noting by price reclaiming the key support level of $1,900 and surging to $1,950, the popular cryptocurrency is showing solid signs of bullish momentum.</p>



<p>Despite its impressive rebound in the first quarter, surging to over $2,150 in April, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has encountered a period of consolidation, facing resistance as it strives to surpass previous price levels. Recently, the price briefly breached the $1,900 mark before retracing after a brief surge to $1,950.</p>



<p>Allemann also emphasized the notable revival of Ether&#8217;s Relative Strength Index (RSI) during its recent upward momentum, stating, <em>&#8220;Backed by an ascending trendline, ETH is positioned for continued expansion. Any potential pullbacks may encounter robust support at $1.8k and $1.65k. Exciting times lie ahead!&#8221;</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/AAAxvPk5KeBeyUmIhpEwu_lhTWKp0HQviv4fAtdOVZdGH_G9jI2H_YFflh7mqBBjQDGPqVjI3QrCmX_Zm8oFCGuIJjUL1uiUcDKgP4Tcm8rwqMM2flBkEn-sGc7DT5yig7SJEl-FIKicvp4X3A8aAQ" alt=""/></figure>



<p>While market volatility is always possible, Yann Allemann&#8217;s noted that potential retracements in Ethereum&#8217;s price could find more substantial support at $1.8k and $1.65k. However, he described this as an opportunity that provides investors with a potential buying opportunity.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/NothinButGains/status/1676714555639218176">tweet</a>, cryptocurrency analyst and trader &#8220;Trader Karl&#8221; highlighted Ethereum&#8217;s price movement, highlighting the $1,910 level. According to the pundit, this resistance level holds significant importance for Ethereum in the short term. If the price manages to break through this level convincingly, it could pave the way for further upward movement, with the following notable resistance point being the April high of $2,100.</p>



<p>Twenty-five-year market veteran Jordan Lindsey shared his analysis on Ether on Wednesday, calling on investors to be cautious even as price trades inside a &#8220;massive contraction&#8221;.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;We are getting close to where we are going to have a resolution of that,</em>&#8221; he <a href="https://twitter.com/TradersMastery/status/1676643227540291584">said</a>, warning that price could break out of either side. He, however, shared his targets, stating that a break above $2,100 could push ETH to around $3,300. Conversely, a breach of the red trendline could trigger a downward move towards $1,140.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/9nn-v2v5jPv5sG-1Z9Ri9rQvIYZJTGLZxl8kbMx5kIBPOq_tJt3FXJqRAhSJxvG6DSZOryUMXYeAsOhzIwo8fWsR2N65jqQT-1QnZS7CtoPZPrvacQXm0jWNwU-V1zl6yHvgoLapBDeYpkXX6tebcw" alt=""/></figure>



<p>That said, Ethereum&#8217;s performance is significant for its ecosystem and the broader cryptocurrency market. As one of the leading cryptocurrencies, Ethereum often sets the tone for other digital assets. Thus, a strong rally in Ethereum could potentially boost the overall market sentiment and encourage further investment in the cryptocurrency space.</p>



<p>At press time, ETH was trading at $1,858, down 0.17% in the past 24 hours, as per data from CoinMarketCap.</p>

<p>Outspoken pro-Ripple lawyer <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-john-deaton-highlights-4-likely-outcomes-in-ripple-vs-sec-suit-as-case-takes-surprising-turn/">John Deaton</a> has expressed optimism regarding the SEC vs Ripple lawsuit, predicting that Judge Torres will thoroughly address the core question of whether XRP is a security in her upcoming summary judgment.</p>



<p>In a Twitter thread on Monday, Deaton firmly asserted that &#8220;XRP IS NOT A SECURITY.&#8221; He then established parallels between XRP and diverse assets like orange groves, whiskey, condos, and even Bitcoin (BTC). Deaton&#8217;s argument centred on the notion that despite these assets being marketed and sold as investment contracts, their inherent characteristics remained unaltered.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;BTC was once sold as an investment contract (SEC v. Shavers), but that particular sale didn&#8217;t transform BTC into anything other than what it is: a digital commodity,&#8221; </em>he stated.</p>



<p>Further, contrary to the belief of many experienced lawyers, Deaton asserted that Judge Torres would not shy away from addressing the issue of secondary sales concerning <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-lawsuit-crypto-lawyer-sheds-light-on-imminent-judgment-in-sec-case-as-xrp-army-awaits-verdict/">XRP</a>.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;I believe Judge Torres has to address the underlying asset and secondary market sales. Could she avoid the issues and issue a ruling? Of course she could. But it would be a greater act of judicial activism to ignore the SEC&#8217;s theory and NOT address these issues,&#8221; </em>he said.</p>



<p>To support his argument, Deaton referred to a similar case handled by Judge Castel in 2020 involving the Telegram messaging app. This legal dispute began when the SEC intervened and halted Telegram&#8217;s intended distribution of GRAM tokens. However, Judge Castel ruled in favour of the SEC, stating that Telegram had to repay investors $1.2 billion from their unsuccessful initial coin offering (ICO) for the Telegram Open Network.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is important to remember that the theory posited by the SEC was that Ripple engaged in continuous activity resembling an ICO, considering each sale of XRP as part of a broader plan involving securities. However, Deaton clarified that the situation with XRP differed from the Telegram case because the latter involved an ICO with written contracts.</p>



<p>Deaton further contended that XRP, powered by the XRP Ledger (XRPL) technology, had been operating effectively and openly traded for over seven years. Notably, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/john-deaton-debates-ripple-security-claims-as-holders-admit-lack-of-research-before-buying-xrp/">even SEC staff</a> members were permitted to own XRP until 2019, which was not the case with the Gram token.</p>



<p>The issue of secondary market transactions of XRP has been a crucial aspect in the SEC and Ripple legal battle. While the SEC accused Ripple of offering XRP as an unregistered security, it did not clearly distinguish between Ripple&#8217;s direct sales and the subsequent trading on the secondary market, leading to confusion. Recently, Deaton opined that Judge Torres might address this issue based on a previous examination in the SEC vs LBRY lawsuit, as it sheds more light on the issue.</p>



<p>That said, while there&#8217;s no guarantee, Judge Torres&#8217; summary judgment decision could shed light on XRP&#8217;s security classification, potentially impacting the crypto industry significantly.</p>

<p>BlackRock, the World&#8217;s largest asset manager, has submitted a revised application for a Bitcoin-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF) to U.S. regulators through Nasdaq.</p>



<p>The filing, which was done on June 29, named Coinbase Global Inc. as a partner, tasked with providing the so-called surveillance support for the proposed ETF due to its huge dollar-to-bitcoin trading volume in the U.S. Notably, according to the document reviewed by ZyCrypto, BlackRock&#8217;s resubmission depict a valid agreement with Coinbase that took effect on June 16.</p>



<p>The decision to amend the application follows recent feedback from the SEC, which deemed initial filings by various issuers such as BlackRock and Fidelity insufficient and lacking the necessary information on the spot bitcoin exchange and surveillance-sharing agreement.</p>



<p>BlackRock&#8217;s initial filing on June 15 mentioned the need for a surveillance-sharing agreement without specifying the exchange that would partner with them. However, other companies, including Fidelity Investments, Invesco, VanEck, 21Shares, and WisdomTree, updated their applications and named Coinbase their surveillance partner.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, as BlackRock&#8217;s latest filing comes to light, concerns arise regarding potential conflicts of interest involving the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These concerns stem from the fact that the SEC has recently taken <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-suffers-double-whammy-as-sec-and-state-regulators-act-against-exchange-for-unregistered-securities/">legal action against Coinbase</a>, accusing the exchange of engaging in the sale of unregistered securities.</p>



<p>In a Monday tweet, pro-ripple lawyer John Deaton hit out at the SEC, claiming that BlackRock&#8217;s filing exposed the agency’s shortcomings.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;The SEC/Gary Gensler are essentially claiming Coinbase is running an illegal business, yet the largest Asset Manager in the World and others are disclosing their intent to do business with this illegal business. It tells you all you need to know about what&#8217;s really going on,&#8221; </em>said Deaton<em>&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Ryan Selkins, the founder and CEO of the crypto data research firm Messari, also expressed his views on the matter. In a July 4 tweet, the pundit stated that the recent news of BlackRock, WisdomTree, and Fidelity choosing Coinbase as their exchange partners simply confirmed what was already known; <em>&#8220;Coinbase is a legitimate U.S. financial institution, and Gary Gensler is a corrupt crony capitalist.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>In a critical tone, Selkins further remarked that Gary Gensler, the current SEC chairman, is a &#8220;corrupt crony capitalist&#8221;, adding that he expects significant developments once Gensler steps down from his position, a resignation he believes will be requested by the White House before the year concludes.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, as the debate surrounding the implementation of a U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF unfolds, the World&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency has continued to hold strong after an 88% increase year-to-date and a 14% surge in the last month alone. As the SEC continues its scrutiny of Bitcoin spot ETF applications, the industry eagerly awaits further developments, with the expectation that an early approval could propel the price of BTC towards its all-time highs.</p>



<p>At the time of reporting, BTC was trading at $30,209, up just over 1% in the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>For investors and holders of MATIC, tensions remain high. According to data, whale buying activity has increased significantly, demonstrating high support and confidence in the project. Large-scale investors appear to know Polygon&#8217;s technology&#8217;s potential and advancements.</p>



<p>Polygon also unveiled &#8220;The Value Prop,&#8221; an open library of blockchain use cases along with the price recovery. This is a significant development as this extensive catalogue features more than 300 applications and several use examples from a range of industry verticals, blockchain networks, and geographic regions. The effort attempts to emphasize blockchain technology&#8217;s beneficial uses outside of asset trading by portraying it as a flexible tool with practical utility.</p>



<p>The crypto community has noticed and backed Polygon&#8217;s dedication to pushing blockchain application cases. The action is a key step toward boosting blockchain technology usage and recognition. The industry has expressed curiosity and excitement in Polygon&#8217;s presentation of upgradeable smart contracts. With the help of these upgradeable smart contracts, developers can modify and update their contracts to increase flexibility and adaptability.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Polygon is also working on “System Smart Contracts Governance”, as Mateusz Rzeszowski, governance facilitator of Polygon Labs, said: <em>“Following the first pillar, we present an approach to upgradeable contracts in Polygon protocols, including a potential governance model which allows for both security and decentralization.”</em></p>



<p>The suggested Ecosystem Council model proposes a decentralized, community-controlled council of credible and tech-savvy persons who can change system smart contracts in a timelock-restricted manner. The community would vote for the council using the $MATIC token, which would be up for election and removal. Polygon Labs notes that any Polygon protocol would require a unique check on the council&#8217;s operations. The governance approach seeks to reconcile effective council governance with community control, requiring less active governance and mitigating potential attack vectors.</p>



<p>Rzeszowski added, “This type of governance can minimize requirements for active governance, voter fatigue, and apathy, as well as potential attack vectors connected to, for example, regularly held elections.<em>”</em></p>



<p>Despite recent turbulence, these promising developments within the Polygon ecosystem have helped rebuild trust in the project. The price recovery and the introduction of &#8220;The Value Prop&#8221; have shown how committed Polygon is to promoting blockchain technology and giving its consumers real value.</p>



<p>As the cryptocurrency industry expands, initiatives like Polygon seek to show blockchain technology&#8217;s potential beyond cryptocurrencies. The range of use cases in &#8220;The Value Prop&#8221; database may inspire entrepreneurs, companies, and developers to research the possibilities presented by blockchain in solving modern issues.</p>



<p>The resilience of Polygon in the face of turbulence and its proactive strategy to push blockchain use cases strengthen its status as a top Web3 network. Investors and business leaders continue to show interest in and support for the initiative.</p>

<p>Binance has managed to defy fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) over the past 24 hours amidst growing regulatory scrutiny and the recent departure of several top executives.</p>



<p>This follows a Thursday <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/07/06/binance-crisis-executives-quit-changpeng-zhao-justice-department/">report</a> by Fortune that the exchange&#8217;s General Counsel Han Ng, Chief Strategy Officer Patrick Hillmann, and Senior Vice President for Compliance Steven Christie had all tendered their resignations in the past week.</p>



<p>As per Fortune&#8217;s report, the resignations were allegedly influenced by investigations initiated by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) against the exchange. The investigations focused on allegations of money laundering, violations of sanctions, and purported efforts to mislead regulators in the United States. Reportedly some insiders also claimed that the recent departures of executives were significantly influenced by <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-boss-zhao-tips-when-the-next-unstoppable-bitcoin-bull-run-will-begin/">Binance CEO</a> Changpeng Zhao&#8217;s &#8220;CZ&#8221; response to the Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation.</p>



<p>However, Hillmann took to Twitter to clarify that his departure was due to personal reasons and not due to any conflict with CZ or the exchange.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>&#8220;It&#8217;s true that I am leaving Binance, but I&#8217;m doing so on good terms. I continue to respect and support CZ and am grateful for having had the incredible opportunity to work under his leadership,&#8221;</em> said Hillman.</p>



<p>On the other hand, while confirming that he is indeed leaving the company, Christie emphasized on Friday that the reasons for his departure are different from what was reported. Having been involved in crypto compliance since 2015, he expressed feeling tired and acknowledged the need to lose some weight, as well as spend more time with his family.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, responding to media inquiries regarding his departure from Binance, Noah Perlman, the Chief Compliance Officer, clarified that he was not leaving the organization, tweeting, &#8220;<em>I&#8217;m proud to be part of this incredible organization as we navigate the growing pains of the crypto industry.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>CZ himself addressed the departures on Twitter, attributing them to regular turnover rather than the speculative reasons suggested by the media.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;More FUD about some departures. Yes, there is turnover (at every company). But the reasons dreamed up by the &#8220;news&#8221; are completely wrong,&#8221;</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1677092535871602691">said</a> CZ.</p>



<p>He emphasized that as the crypto market and global landscape evolve, personnel changes are common in any organization. CZ further thanked the former team members for their contributions to Binance&#8217;s growth and wished them the best in their future endeavours.</p>



<p>That said, despite the ongoing controversies and legal challenges, Binance has exhibited remarkable resilience, attracting a significant influx of deposits that reflect the continued confidence traders have in the exchange. According to data from DefiLama, within the past 24 hours, approximately $1.99 billion in deposits have been made to the platform, underscoring the enduring trust and support Binance enjoys within the crypto community.</p>



<p>The crypto market has also been displaying a notable level of stability, as Bitcoin reclaimed its position above $30,000 shortly after experiencing a minor dip following the Fortune report.</p>

<p>BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager and currently the de-facto leader of the ETF movement, applied with the SEC last month, driving optimism and higher bitcoin prices.</p>



<p>While most crypto fans believe the hoped-for successful approval of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the U.S. would be a seminal moment in the history of crypto, JPMorgan analysts claim such a move by the SEC would not have a significant impact on the market for a couple of reasons.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-spot-bitcoin-etfs-have-rather-marginal-benefits"><strong>Spot Bitcoin ETFs Have “Rather Marginal” Benefits</strong></h2>



<p>The news surrounding a flurry of applications from the likes of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-primed-for-trillion-dollar-boost-as-blackrock-expects-landmark-bitcoin-etf-approval/">BlackRock</a>, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/11-1-trillion-giant-fidelity-renews-push-for-spot-bitcoin-etf/">Fidelity</a>, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/spot-bitcoin-etf-craze-valkyrie-becomes-the-latest-firm-to-apply-for-sec-approval/">Valkyrie</a>, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-etfs-in-motion-an-analysis-of-open-spot-btc-etf-applications-in-the-market/">WisdomTree</a>,<a href="https://zycrypto.com/ark-invest-gains-edge-in-spot-bitcoin-etf-race-with-epic-surveillance-sharing-maneuver/"> ARK Invest</a>, and others, for a spot bitcoin ETF sent the price of the bellwether crypto to multi-month highs. For most enthusiasts, this was a sign that institutional investment into the cryptoverse was once again upon us.</p>



<p>However, JPMorgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou point out in a Thursday report that spot BTC ETFs have long existed in Canada and Europe without garnering much investor interest, hence “the potential approval of physically backed bitcoin ETFs by the SEC [Securities and Exchange Commission] is unlikely to be a game changer for crypto markets.&#8221;</p>



<p>The analysts also acknowledged that spot BTC ETFs provide certain advantages over futures bitcoin ETFs, but these benefits are “rather marginal”. Physically-backed Bitcoin ETFs would allow a large swath of retail American investors to have skin in the game without having to store the cryptocurrency themselves. Unlike the futures-based ETFs, these spot ETFs also have the potential to reflect real-time supply and demand more accurately, causing improved liquidity and enhanced price transparency, as per JPMorgan analysts.</p>



<p>Yet, the launch of spot bitcoin ETFs could transfer trading activity from bitcoin futures markets in the U.S. &#8220;to the extent spot bitcoin ETFs replace futures-based bitcoin ETFs,&#8221; they added.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Will 2023 Be The Year Of The Spot Bitcoin ETF?</strong></h2>



<p>While several high-profile funds and companies have filed paperwork for spot Bitcoin ETFs with the SEC in the past, all have either backed out or faced outright denials from the U.S. regulator since 2017. In Canada, however, key funds, including Purpose Bitcoin, 3iQ CoinShares, and CI Galaxy Bitcoin — all directly invested in spot BTC — are already available for customers.</p>



<p>JPMorgan strategists believe the SEC might actually OK one of the recent new applications for the long-awaited spot product because some of the regulator’s previous concerns are assumed to be addressed as the would-be ETF issuers have indicated their intention to enter into surveillance-sharing agreements with Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the US. Under a surveillance-sharing agreement, information about market trading and clearing activities is shared between entities to deter any potential market manipulation.</p>



<p>Last month, the SEC approved the first leveraged bitcoin futures ETF, Volatility Shares 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITX). The open question now is whether the commission will also approve the first-ever spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. this year. </p>
