<li dir="ltr">UK&rsquo;s HM Treasury has outlined tax policy changes targeted at DeFi lending and staking.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The proposals are part of a consultation on taxation of activities conducted using crypto assets in DeFi.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The new changes are also looking to apply to crypto lending and staking transactions on centralised finance (CeFi) platforms.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">HM Treasury, the UK&rsquo;s economic and finance ministry, has announced an open consultation regarding the taxation of decentralised finance (DeFi) activities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Per a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/the-taxation-of-decentralised-finance-involving-the-lending-and-staking-of-cryptoassets/the-taxation-of-decentralised-finance-defi-involving-the-lending-and-staking-of-cryptoassets--2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">publication</a> the government released on Thursday, 27 April 2023, the consultation seeks to have public views on the modification of tax policies to cater to crypto asset related lending and staking &ndash; two key activities in the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/defi/">DeFi industry</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The objective of the consultation is to help formulate a crypto tax regime for the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/uk/">UK</a>, where taxation DeFi lending and staking &ldquo;<em>better aligns with the underlying economic substance, whilst reducing the administrative burden on users</em>,&rdquo; the HM Treasury wrote.</p>
<p dir="ltr">HMRC is therefore looking to get feedback from key stakeholders within the DeFi space, including tech and financial firms involved in DeFi, investors, and professionals. Also invited to participate are trade associations, academic institutions, legal firms, and tax advisory firms among others.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Crypto tax framework also targets CeFi</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The government also says that the consultation seeks to explore legislative changes to overall tax treatment of lending and staking in the industry. The changes, the HM Treasury noted, involve proposals that using cryptocurrencies in DeFi transactions &ldquo;<em>would no longer be treated as giving rise to a disposal for tax purposes</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Rather, tax disposals will only arise where taxpayers economically dispose of their crypto assets via non-DeFi transactions. The finance ministry added in the announcement:</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>Although the focus of this document is on DeFi lending and staking, the proposed tax framework outlined below is also intended to apply to the lending and staking of crypto assets which is done through an intermediary. Some industry participants refer to these arrangements as Centralised Finance (CeFi)</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>HM Treasury&rsquo;s consultation paper comes amid increased recognition within the government agencies that proper and clear regulatory approach to crypto is needed as the industry grows rapidly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proposals are likely to form a major part of the UK&rsquo;s<a href="https://coinjournal.net/crypto-tax/uk-guide/">&nbsp;<u>crypto tax guidelines</u></a> in 2024, the same year the EU&rsquo;s crypto law MiCA is expected to come into effect.</p>

<li dir="ltr">Kaspa price rose to highs above $0.031 before giving up gains to sit around $0.030.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The upside momentum for the altcoin was derailed as major exchange Uphold announced it was delaying the listing of KAS.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Uphold says the delay is due to a technical issue that will soon be sorted out.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/kaspa/">Kaspa (KAS)</a> was among the biggest gainers earlier today as cryptocurrencies looked to bounce following <a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>&rsquo;s sharp decline overnight Wednesday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the past 24 hours, as BTC looked to reclaim $29,000, the price of Kaspa rose more than 10% to break above $0.031. The upside saw KAS bulls begin to eye the token&rsquo;s all-time high near $0.043 reached on 2 April 2023.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That attempt to put bears in their place is on hold though as one of the major catalysts for the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/altcoin/">altcoin</a> going up was the impending listing on a major US crypto exchange</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Uphold delays listing of Kaspa (KAS)</h2>
<p dir="ltr">On Thursday, <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/uphold-review-all-you-need-to-know-about-this-multi-asset-digital-trading-platform/">Uphold</a>, which was set to be the first centralised crypto exchange in the US to list KAS, announced it would be delaying the listing. The multi-asset digital asset platform said the &ldquo;difficult decision&rdquo; had been taken due to technical issues.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">&#9888;&#65039; KAS listing delayed</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve made the difficult decision to postpone this listing due to technical issues.</p>
<p>Our customers deserve a smooth and fair trading experience &ndash; and we&rsquo;re excited to list KAS as soon as we can ensure this. <a href="https://t.co/qJGuB2cY4H">pic.twitter.com/qJGuB2cY4H</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Uphold (@UpholdInc) <a href="https://twitter.com/UpholdInc/status/1651589288037892097?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 27, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p dir="ltr">But despite the delay, Dr. Martin Hiesboeck, the Head of Research at Uphold, has assured KAS holders that the issue was &ldquo;minor&rdquo; and will soon be solved. He <a href="https://twitter.com/MHiesboeck/status/1651592761575895045" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tweeted</a>:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;As we&rsquo;re expecting *high demand*, we&rsquo;ve taken the difficult decision to delay this listing due to some technical issues &ndash; to ensure you get a smooth and fair trading experience and best execution. Won&rsquo;t be long, it&rsquo;s a minor thing we&rsquo;ll sort out soon</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">He offered to explain everything on the Twitter Space.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After seeing a double digit uptick in price, with weekly gains rising to over 30%, Kaspa price is just in the green in the past day (at the time of writing) and about 28% higher over the week.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Currently, KAS can be traded on multiple exchanges, including MEXC Global, Gate.io and BingX. The token&rsquo;s recent momentum has come amid a flurry of listings, including on LBank and Bitget.</p>

<li dir="ltr">The insolvency court order against CoinLoan was reportedly issued on Monday, 24 April, 2023 in Estonia.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">In <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/">cryptocurrency news</a> today, Bit4You, the first Belgium-based cryptocurrency lending platform,has announced its suspending its activities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The crypto assets exchange made the announcement in a <a href="https://bit4you.medium.com/suspention-des-activit%C3%A9s-7376a2fe90da" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notice</a> to clients and the community late Wednesday. According to the platform, the decision to halt operations came after it had learned that CoinLoan, its main provider, no longer had the required registration to operate as a virtual currency provider in Estonia.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/first-belgian-cryptocurrency-platform-suspends-its-activities-2023-04-27/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> <u>reported</u></a> by Reuters on Thursday, an Estonian court declared CoinLoan insolvent on Monday, 24 April, 2023</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bit4You says its immediate suspension of activities is one of several steps it is taking as it tries to understand the whole situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, the crypto lender says it has no reason to believe that the cryptocurrencies the custody provider held on behalf of its customers cannot be recovered.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">2023 is the year in which the crypto rebound hopefully gets into full swing following a disappointing 2022. One project arousing exceptional interest among investors and trading groups on Reddit and Telegram is AltSignals&rsquo; ASI presale. Already a market leader in trading signals, AltSignals has set itself up as arguably one of the best crypto projects to invest in this year due to an exciting adoption of AI technologies designed to turbocharge its trading capabilities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here&rsquo;s why investors are scrambling to get their hands on this exciting new coin during its presale event.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>AltSignals: Assisting crypto gains since 2017</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://token.altsignals.io/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal_currentevents&amp;news&amp;utm_content=as_presale%20_1&amp;utm_id=178" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>AltSignals</u></a> was launched in 2017 and has grown to become one of the leading providers of trading signals for a vast community numbering more than 50,000 members, 1,400 of whom enjoy all the perks of AltSignals&rsquo; VIP group. AltSignals has focused on setting itself apart from competitors by ensuring it produces the most accurate trading signals available in crypto, Forex, and stock markets via its market-leading AltAlgo&trade; trading tool.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This algorithmic trading indicator has operated in tandem with a team of leading expert traders to generate more than 1,500 signals for traders scattered across the globe. A Binance Spot signals program in January 2023 saw a 94% win rate across 17 trades, achieving returns of 175% in a single month. This success came hot on the heels of a whopping 384% return in December 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">AltSignals&rsquo; performance is backed up by almost 500 positive reviews on Trustpilot, resulting in a 4.9/5 star rating, making it one of the most-trusted providers of trading signals. Now AltSignals is seeking to take its outstanding platform into another realm with the launch of the ActualizeAI trading stack and ASI coin.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>What is the ASI token?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">The ASI token underpins the entire AltSignals&rsquo; ecosystem, including the development of ActualizeAI, which will bring a pioneering AI capability to AltSignals. This looks likely to help AltSignals play a significant role in the crypto rebound by harnessing the power of machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), reinforcement learning, and predictive modeling to increase the frequency and accuracy of the platform&rsquo;s signals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Possession of the ASI coin will open up the actual value of AltSignals&rsquo; platform, beginning with the ActualizeAI trading stack and outputs. Community members holding more than 50,000 tokens will be granted lifetime access to ActualizeAI&rsquo;s signals, while those holding fewer than 50,000 can enjoy a 1-year membership.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While this is a huge incentive to get involved in what looks like one of the best new crypto tokens of the year, holding the ASI coin unlocks several premium offers and opportunities for investors and traders to exploit.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For instance, ASI coin holders can join the AI Members Club, unlocking early access to some of the best presale opportunities with exciting new crypto projects from AltSignals&rsquo; affiliate partners or highlighted by ActualizeAI&rsquo;s sentiment analysis feature. While opening up potentially rich opportunities to make serious profits, users can also boost their earnings by participating in regular online trading tournaments with lucrative prizes.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>How high can ASI go in 2023?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">The release of the ASI token has been deliberately timed to support the development of ActualizeAI&rsquo;s trading stack, which will drive enormous levels of utility into the coin. In addition, ASI coin holders can vote on community-led initiatives that will govern the platform&rsquo;s future direction, ensuring it continues to meet the needs of those it serves.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This alone would be enough to push the price of ASI higher once it&rsquo;s released for public consumption. However, ASI has the fortune of being released as the crypto rebound continues to gather momentum, meaning it looks set to reap the full reward of being part of the next bull market in the coming months and years.</p>
<p dir="ltr">ASI&rsquo;s presale will end at $0.02274 per token, which looks severely undervalued. As a result, analysts are predicting significant gains for early coin holders in 2023, with many forecasting that $0.50 is more than achievable by the end of the year. This would represent enormous returns of more than 20x for any investor that reserved their ASI token during the presale.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>The ASI presale could be the best crypto to invest in this year</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">It&rsquo;s easy to see why many professional crypto analysts are naming ASI as the best crypto to invest in this year. The ActualizeAI trading stack could put AltSignals squarely on the map as one of the most comprehensive trading signal providers on the markets, with a flurry of new customers scrambling to sign up for access to its turbocharged outputs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, with community-led governance and a user-feedback system, all products will be fully peer-reviewed and tested by real traders, allowing AltSignals to fully optimize ActualizeAI&rsquo;s algorithm and provide the best possible outputs to its community.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Interested investors are advised to act fast, with the&nbsp;stage 1&nbsp;round selling out quickly at the lowest possible price of&nbsp;$0.015. ASI will never be this low again, meaning time is running out for investors to make the best potential returns with the crypto rebound squarely gathering pace.</p>

<li dir="ltr">Hong Kong&rsquo;s new cryptocurrency licensing framework is expected in May.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) chief executive Julia Leung told Bloomberg the guidelines follow a consultative process.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Companies seeking to offer services in Hong Kong will need to apply for and get licenses from the commission.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Hong Kong is taking the next step in providing further regulatory clarity for <a href="https://coinjournal.net/cryptocurrencies/">cryptocurrencies</a> by releasing its crypto exchange licensing framework.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Specifically, the licensing guidelines will require every digital asset service provider and operator to seek and acquire approval from the regulator.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Julia Leung, chief executive of Hong Kong&rsquo;s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), revealed this on Thursday, telling<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-27/hong-kong-sfc-to-issue-crypto-exchange-license-guidelines-in-may" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;<u>Bloomberg</u></a> that the guidelines are expected in May. The legislation is expected to come into effect from June.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to Leung, the digital assets regulation framework comes after a vital consultative process that a<a href="https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202210/31/P2022103000454.htm?fontSize=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;<u>policy statement</u></a> from the government in October last year. The statement highlighted the need to regulate virtual assets, including sectors such as DeFi and NFTs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The SFC reportedly received more than 150 responses from various players, following the consultative process.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Hong Kong&rsquo;s crypto framework comes after EU&rsquo;s MiCA approval</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Hong Kong has recently taken an aggressive approach to <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/crypto-regulation/">crypto regulation</a> even as it looks to make itself a leading crypto-friendly jurisdiction. Recent administrative policies have indeed seen the number of companies looking to operate from the city-state jump to near 100.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Other than cryptocurrency exchanges, there are multiple projects and platforms in Web3 security, blockchain payments, and infrastructure that are currently eyeing SFC&rsquo;s licensing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Recently, the European Union parliament <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/european-parliament-finally-adopts-the-markets-in-crypto-assets-act-mica/">voted</a> to approve the Markets in Crypto Act, MiCA regulation, that has been hailed as key to regulatory clarity for the crypto industry in the EU.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Many obersers say the law, expected to take effect in 2024, will herald a <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/mica-constitutes-a-new-era-for-crypto-swarm-co-founder-philipp-pieper-says/">new era for crypto</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 dir="ltr">Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Bitcoin led markets on a ride Wednesday, surging from $28K to $30K before shedding 7% in an hour</li>
<li dir="ltr">Surge had come following optimism for liquidity injection from Fed, as banking issues resurfaced at First Republic and shares cratered 50%&nbsp;</li>
<li dir="ltr">Markets are too thin and prone to these large price swings, writes our Head of Research, Dan Ashmore&nbsp;</li>
<li dir="ltr">Highlights how dangerous the sector can be in the short term, he says, warning enthusiasts to be careful</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p dir="ltr">I wrote a <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/dont-be-fooled-by-bitcoins-recent-calm-volatility-is-coming-opinion/">few days ago</a> about the state of crypto markets, warning that volatility was incoming following an unusually calm period for digital assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Last night that volatility came, and it came hard. It doesn&rsquo;t make me a genius, as the timing was nothing more than blind luck, but it does demonstrate my point. The crypto markets are currently highly sensitive, even more so than usual, and that won&rsquo;t change anytime soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">On Wednesday morning, Bitcoin jumped from $28,300 to close to $30,000 in the space of a couple of hours. This came as First Republic Bank announced it had been subject to $100 billion of withdrawals last quarter, its share price tanking 50%.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite what enthusiasts may argue, crypto did not rise because the fiat world is collapsing, the banking sector going the way of the T-Rex and the dodo bird. Some decried crypto as a store of value outside of the creaking system, scooping up panicking investors fleeing the fiat world.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sure, in the long term, there could be discussion to be had here, but that is for another day. Instead, it appears likely that coins surged in anticipation of more liquidity injections from the Federal Reserve.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In other words, crypto did what it has been doing all year: moved in response to expectations around the future path of monetary policy. A quick look at Bitcoin&rsquo;s correlation with the Nasdaq shows this, now at a near-perfect 1 on a 90-day rolling basis, should affirm this. Bitcoin, and crypto as a whole, continues to trade like a highly risky tech stock.&nbsp;</p>
<pre data-stringify-type="pre">        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/13550891">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    </pre>
<p dir="ltr">But back to volatility. After the surge Wednesday morning, Bitcoin then plunged from $29,700 to $27,700, a 7% red candle in a little over an hour. As of Thursday morning, it is back at $29,000, as it reverberates all over the place, struggling to make up its mind. &nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Rumours swirled around the possible movement of Mt Gox coins, while some pointed to the apparent US government wallets becoming active. I had a quick look into these and it&rsquo;s ultimately impossible to prove the two developments are connected. They may be, but it&rsquo;s not clear that this is what caused the sharp fall.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In reality, this is exactly what I was pointing to earlier this week. Whatever the reason for the plunge, crypto markets are incredibly thin right now and primed for violent moves.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Capital has flooded out of the space over the last year at a remarkable pace. One nice way to illustrate this is by looking at the stablecoin balance on exchanges (deep dive <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/45-of-stablecoin-balance-has-left-crypto-exchanges-in-4-months-but-where-has-all-the-money-gone-a-deep-dive/"><u>here</u></a>). Since December, over half the stablecoin balance on exchanges has evaporated, translating to $21.7 billion.&nbsp;</p>
<pre data-stringify-type="pre">        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/13547917">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    &nbsp;</pre>
<p dir="ltr">While the horrors of the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/ftx-insolvent-what-next-for-crypto/"><u>FTX collapse</u></a> may be banished to the back of investors&rsquo; minds, the effect on the crypto industry remains real. Alameda was a large market maker in the space, with that hole not filled since. Then there is the psychological impact; crypto&rsquo;s reputation has taken a ferocious blow, with institutions scaling back perceptibly from the space.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">This has left liquidity low, and with low liquidity comes more volatility. Moves in either direction are amplified, which is what we saw yesterday. Looking at data from Coinglass, liquidations swelled for both longs and shorts, $180 million for the former and $130 million for the latter.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/03/27/1682598551435-c4b0eac9-c986-4403-afa3-053046901086.jpg" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="218"></p>
<p dir="ltr">This volatility won&rsquo;t go away anytime soon. Crypto was always more illiquid and prone to big moves than most mainstream asset classes, and this chasm has only widened in recent months.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">It&rsquo;s part of the reason why crypto remains so dangerous over a short-term time horizon. Get caught on the wrong side of one of these moves, and your investment can evaporate in an instant.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Oftentimes, there is no rhyme or reason, with the markets highly capricious. But with liquidity thin, it only needs a small spark and then liquations can cascade, sentiment can shift in the blink of an eye and prices can go wild.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Be careful.&nbsp;</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">MultiversX price jumped sharply on Thursday.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">This happened after Upbit listed the coin in its ecosystem.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/elrond/"><u>MultiversX</u></a> price jumped sharply as investors reacted to the latest listing in Upbit, one of the leading&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/compare/best-cryptocurrency-exchanges/"><u>crypto exchanges</u></a><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>EGLD jumped to a high of $52.01, the highest level since February 21 of this year. In all, the coin has risen by more than 37% from the lowest level this year.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Why is MultiversX soaring?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">MultiversX, formerly known as Elrond, is a leading blockchain project that aims to be a good replacement for Ethereum and Solana. Its main advantage over Ethereum is that it was one of the earliest blockchains to adapt the sharding technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">First implemented by Ziliqa, sharding is a technology that boosts transaction throughputs by breaking blocks into smaller pieces known as shards. MultiversX is also highly cost-effective for users, with the average transaction cost being about $0.0022.</p>
<p dir="ltr">MultiversX has been embraced by developers creating dApps in industries like&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/learn/what-is-defi/"><u>DeFi</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/glossary/non-fungible-token-nft/"><u>non-fungible tokens</u></a><strong>,&nbsp;</strong>and the metaverse among others. According to its website, the network has over 2.2 million wallets and has completed over 314 million transactions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The main reason why the EGLD price is surging is that Upbit decided to list the coin. This is a major event since Upbit is one of the biggest exchanges in the world with over 8.6 million customers globally.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In most cases, we often ss cryptocurrencies jump after a major exchange listing. For example, as we wrote&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/crypto-price-prediction-matic-floki-and-dione/"><u>here</u></a><strong>,&nbsp;</strong>FlokI Inu price jumped this week after it was listed by Binance US. Historically, these gains tend to be short-lived.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24EGLD&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$EGLD</a> is now listed on <a href="https://twitter.com/Official_Upbit?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Official_Upbit</a>, the world&rsquo;s 1st crypto exchange by fiat volume &amp; 2nd largest by spot volume.</p>
<p>Opening up EGLD trading for 8.9M+ users.</p>
<p>Deposits and trading are live on the EGLD/KRW and EGLD/BTC pairs.<a href="https://t.co/r7yuMjNAT3">https://t.co/r7yuMjNAT3</a> <a href="https://t.co/wE3cFjpAij">pic.twitter.com/wE3cFjpAij</a></p>
<p>&mdash; MultiversX (@MultiversX) <a href="https://twitter.com/MultiversX/status/1651484708943847425?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 27, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">EGLD price prediction</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/03/27/1682598077585-52a14f06-43b5-4843-9f76-67383c6faad2.png" style="width: 651px;height: 316.82px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="651" height="316.82"></p>
<p dir="ltr">The daily chart shows that the EGLD price made a bullish breakout after being listed in Upbit. It moved above the 50-day moving average and retested the key resistance point at $52.01. This was an important level since it was the highest point in February.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Therefore, I suspect that EGLD will retreat slightly in the next few days and then resume the bullish trend. The final part will depend on the performance of other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">How to buy MultiverseX</h2>

<li>Dymension is a blockchain startup building a network of easily deployable modular blockchains called RollApps.</li>
<li>Dymension has partnered with Evmos Core Teams and Celestia.</li>
<li>The three have launched the world&rsquo;s first-ever IBC-enabled EVM rollup on testnet.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://dymension.xyz/">Dymension</a> has announced its collaboration with Celestia and Evmos Core Teams to launch the world&rsquo;s first-ever IBC-enabled EVM rollup on testnet.</p>
<p>Dymension has built-in rollups technology for scalability and it is creating an ecosystem of easily deployable and lighting-fast RollApps that any developer can use to build and deploy in order to scale their decentralized applications.</p>
<h2>IBC-enabled EVM rollup</h2>
<p>The IBC-enabled EVM RollApp will be deployed within Dymension&rsquo;s initial testing ground &ldquo;35-C&rdquo;, as part of its long-term plan to establish and bootstrap a new ecosystem of IBC-enabled rollups. The deployment was made possible through close collaboration with the Evmos Core Development Team, as the RollApp uses Ethermint, an implementation of the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/ethereum/what-is-ethereum/">Ethereum </a>Virtual Machine that&rsquo;s built on top of Dymension&rsquo;s RollApp.</p>
<p>Commenting about the new RollApp, Dymension Lab&rsquo;s CEO and Co-Founder, Yishay Harel, said:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Excited to have worked closely with the Evmos team to achieve this milestone. With the world&rsquo;s first IBC-enabled EVM rollup now deployed on testnet, we&rsquo;re one step closer to bringing scalable and interoperable blockchain solutions to the wider community. This is just the beginning of our journey, and we&rsquo;re looking forward to continuing to push the boundaries of what&rsquo;s possible with EVM-based technology.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The new EVM RollApp utilizes the EVMOS token as its gas token and updates its state to the Dymension Hub and posts data to Celestia&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mocha&rdquo; testnet.</p>
<p>In addition, the new RollApp will feature a Uniswap V2 fork and a bespoke frontend, as part of a proof-of-concept to demonstrate how anyone can deploy their own RollApp and host EVM dApps. Developers will be able to fork any EVM-based dApp and deploy it on the RollApp using Dymension&rsquo;s technology.</p>
<p>In addition, since Dymension&rsquo;s RollApp is IBC-enabled it can natively connect to the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/cosmos/what-is-cosmos/">Cosmos </a>ecosystem of the IBC blockchain.</p>
