<p>Etherscan's previous reports indicate that the total supply of BRISE tokens is an astounding 405 billion.

<p>While BRISE has been enjoying positive growth, other major cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) have experienced losses in the past 24 hours.
