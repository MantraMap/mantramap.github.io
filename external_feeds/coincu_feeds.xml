<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Metis takes snapshots of METIS holdings on the BNB Chain during the Poly Network attack to protect user assets and ensure transparency.</em></li>



<li><em>The platform advises users not to interact with the current token contract on the BNB Chain, deploys a new contract, and recommends liquidity providers to withdraw from Pancake Swap to enhance security measures.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In response to the recent Poly Network attack, Metis, the Web3 platform, has taken decisive steps to protect METIS holdings on the BNB Chain.&nbsp;</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20230201_Metis-1200x675-1-1024x576.jpeg"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20230201_Metis-1200x675-1-1024x576.jpeg" alt="Metis Safeguards METIS Holdings Amid Poly Network Attack" class="wp-image-200195" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20230201_Metis-1200x675-1-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20230201_Metis-1200x675-1-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20230201_Metis-1200x675-1-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20230201_Metis-1200x675-1-750x422.jpeg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20230201_Metis-1200x675-1-1140x641.jpeg 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20230201_Metis-1200x675-1.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Metis Safeguards METIS Holdings Amid Poly Network Attack 1"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>On July 5th, Metis announced via Twitter that it has taken snapshots of METIS holding addresses during two critical periods, namely the Poly Network attack and the initial sale of this token by the attacker. Importantly, any METIS purchases made on the identified address will not be recognized.</p>



<p>To ensure the security and integrity of <a href="https://coincu.com/164236-metis-with-banxa-simplify-crypto-adoption/">METIS</a> tokens, the platform advises users against interacting with the current token contract on the BNB Chain. Instead, the platform will deploy a new contract to address any vulnerabilities. This proactive measure aims to maintain the trust and confidence of the community.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A snapshot was taken of the BNBChain addresses holding METIS at the time of PolyNetworkâ€™s exploit, and at the time of the exploiters first sale of exploited METIS.

</div></figure>



<p>Additionally,  the platform urges liquidity providers to withdraw all liquidity from Pancake Swap. By doing so, they can safeguard their assets and minimize potential risks associated with the ongoing situation. Ensuring the protection of user funds and maintaining a secure ecosystem are their top priorities.</p>



<p>The Poly Network attack, which made headlines on July 3rd, saw hackers exploit vulnerabilities across multiple chains, resulting in the issuance of more than ten different assets worth a staggering $34 billion. The platform&#8217; swift response to the attack demonstrates its commitment to safeguarding the interests of its users and actively addressing security concerns.</p>

<p>The platform continues to monitor the situation closely and is actively working towards implementing necessary measures to enhance the security and resilience of its platform. By taking snapshots of METIS holdings and deploying a new contract, they aims to mitigate any potential risks and ensure the long-term stability of its ecosystem.</p>



<p>As the investigation into the Poly Network attack unfolds, the team remains dedicated to providing transparent updates and ensuring the safety of user assets. Users are encouraged to stay updated with official announcements from the platform and exercise caution while engaging with any related activities on the BNB Chain.</p>

<p>The recently passed &#8220;Act on the Protection of Users of Virtual Assets&#8221; primarily focuses on user protection and regulation of unfair trade practices, prompting the need for supplementary regulations related to market order and virtual asset issuance and financing.</p>



<p>The Financial Services Commission (FSC) held a digital asset private joint task force (TF) working group meeting, outlining the second-stage legislation that will establish virtual assets as an institutional system. Discussions were held regarding the key components to be included in the upcoming legislation.</p>



<p>The first bill, known as the <a href="https://coincu.com/195023-south-korean-banks-limit-crypto-deposits/">Virtual Asset User Protection Act</a>, has already been passed by the National Assembly. It covers areas such as safeguarding user assets, regulating unfair practices in the virtual asset market, and granting financial authorities the power to oversee and penalize market participants.</p>

<p>In response to the National Assembly&#8217;s call for research services for the second-stage legislation, the FSC is taking steps to ensure the smooth integration of the virtual asset industry into the institutional framework. This includes addressing conflicts of interest that may arise during the issuance and distribution of virtual assets.</p>



<p>The Financial Services Commission aims to order research services for the second phase of virtual asset legislation either by this month or the next. By initiating this research, they are actively working towards the development of comprehensive regulations that will govern the virtual asset market and promote its long-term stability.</p>



<p>As the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, these research efforts will play a crucial role in shaping the regulatory framework and ensuring a secure and transparent environment for virtual asset users and businesses alike.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Australian regulator ASIC investigates Binance&#8217;s derivatives business.</em></li>



<li><em>The company&#8217;s Australian offices were searched as part of the ongoing inquiry.</em></li>



<li><em>The exchange faces global investigations, including in the US and France.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-05/binance-australia-offices-searched-by-regulator-as-part-of-derivatives-probe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a></em>, The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) is conducting an investigation into Binance, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange.</strong></h5>

<p>According to unnamed sources, ASIC searched the company&#8217;s Australian offices as part of an ongoing inquiry into the exchange&#8217;s now-defunct local derivatives business. The categorization of retail and wholesale customers by Binance Australia is the subject of ASIC&#8217;s investigation.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/199795-binance-drops-spot-volume/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a> said in April that it would close its local futures exchange while continuing to operate its spot platform. Due to misclassification as wholesale investors, the business claimed to have terminated the derivatives holdings of some Australian customers.</p>



<p>ASIC, who had previously suspended Binance Australia&#8217;s derivatives license, indicated that their investigation against the business is still continuing and declined to confirm or deny the search activities. The exchange replied by saying its collaboration with local authorities and commitment to achieving regulatory requirements in order to provide fully compliant service to Australian customers.</p>

<p>Binance is facing several investigations and difficulties throughout the world, notably in the United States, where the US Securities and Exchange Commission has accused it of mishandling user assets and violating securities laws.</p>

<p>Authorities in France paid a visit to Binance last month. French authorities are looking into the suspected unlawful offering of digital-asset services as well as aggravated money laundering. The exchange has said that it complies with all regulations in France and every other market in which it operates.</p>



<p>On June 26, the exchange also withdrew its application for regulatory accreditation in Austria. After failing to get regulatory approval, the exchange announced its withdrawal from the Netherlands earlier this month. It has also attempted to deregister its local firm in <a href="https://coincu.com/197893-bybit-now-secures-license-to-cyprus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyprus</a>, and a few weeks ago, Belgium&#8217;s regulator <a href="https://coincu.com/197526-binance-ordered-to-stop-in-belgium/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ordered</a> Binance to cease activities in the country.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Ethereum Layer 2 network Starknet launched on the Georli test network for voting on Starknet v0.12.0 on July 4.</em></li>



<li><em>Deployment to the mainnet is expected on July 12 after a frozen period on July 11.</em></li>



<li><em>The upcoming release focuses on improving network performance and reducing transaction latency.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>On July 4, the Ethereum Layer 2 network Starknet was launched on the Georli test network to commence voting for <a href="https://coincu.com/199386-starknet-0-12-0-upgrade-better-ux-lower-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Starknet v0.12.0</strong>.</a></strong></h5>

<p>The test voting period has started and will finish on July 6. After that, the formal voting for Starknet v0.12.0 will begin, and it is slated to conclude on July 10. According to the vote results, Starknet v0.12.0 is likely to be deployed to the mainnet on July 12 after the frozen period on July 11.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/194137-why-is-starknet-ecosystem-explosive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">StarkNet</a> is an Ethereum Layer 2 solution that takes the shape of a ZK-Rollup. Because of StarkNet&#8217;s dependency on the STARK system &#8211; StarkWare&#8217;s technological development &#8211; any dApp may run, function, and expand endlessly without jeopardizing Ethereum&#8217;s capacity to aggregate and protect.</p>

<p>The network contract and operating system are developed in the Cairo programming language, which allows for the deployment and scalability of Dapps or smart contracts independent of business logic.</p>



<p>Starknet had announced that the new mainnet would be available in a matter of weeks. Moreover, the Starknet literature states that the future Starknet v0.12.0 release will concentrate on boosting network performance to increase scaling and transaction latency.</p>



<p>A new Rust implementation of Sequencer will be created to do this. The Sequencer incorporates more efficient local storage and critical route logic to drastically cut transaction confirmation wait times and alleviate network congestion.</p>



<p>The suggested architecture for the Starknet Alpha v0.12.0 upgrade plan is as follows, according to the Starknet governance page:</p>



<ul>
<li>Integration period: the stable version is integrated during the first 7 days.</li>



<li>Testnet period: deployment on the Goerli testnet in the first three days, followed by five days of voting, and finally one day of waiting (Freeze period).</li>
</ul>



<p>Install the main network the next day for a total of 17 days.</p>

<p>Eligible users to claim, they will see a relevant banner at the top of the loan page.</p>

<p>Yesterday, ParaSpace announced its decision to<a href="https://coincu.com/199951-paraspace-temporarily-suspend-azukis-pool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> temporarily suspend</a> Azuki&#8217;s team, including deposits, withdrawals, and liquidations. This measure is intended to give users more time to replenish liquidity, repay debt and improve health.</p>



<p>The decision was made in connection with the recent Azuki ecosystem collections that received a lot of criticism from the community for disappointing them with the new Elemental collection.</p>

<p>After the crisis of confidence broke out in Azuki, the price collapsed by more than 50% within 7 days. Amid insufficient liquidity, NFT lending platform ParaSpace abruptly suspended the liquidation of Azuki&#8217;s collateral yesterday, resulting in tens of thousands of dollars in bad debt.</p>



<p>While the official stated that the move is intended to give users more time to replenish liquidity, repay debt, and improve health, the liquidation will continue after that. And the lending platform says any shortfall at the end of the suspension will be covered by ParaSpace&#8217;s reserves. But it should be noted that ParaSpace&#8217;s losses could continue to spread without stabilizing Azuki&#8217;s price.</p>



<p>At a time when the market is facing major challenges from the sharp decline in market prices, lending contracts need to prove their worth for an illiquid asset like NFT.</p>



<p>ParaSpace is a Lending project that the community notices in the NFTFi array. Although it has only just launched the mainnet version, the platform has surpassed BendDAO to lead the TVL ranking of NFT Lending projects.</p>

<p>Looking at this token&#8217;s spike in price chart and the project&#8217;s questionable behavior, it may be necessary for investors to question whether this rally can continue or is just a bull trap and can disappoint investors with the upcoming downtrend.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>However, Against Bitcoin, after trading over the past few days, the bulls have shown great commitment to STORJ trading by following the recent positive sign. Furthermore, the current market trend could continue to move upwards if buyers can sustain further pressure.</p>



<p>Of the 30 assets in the computing sector, Storj holds 1.14% of the market cap at $211,934,048. Currently, the circulating supply 408,576,965 STORJ and total supply 424,999,998 STORJ.</p>



<p>The reason for the latest price action in STORJ is attributed to Koreans being the STORJ/KRW trading pair on the country&#8217;s largest crypto exchange, Upbit, currently accounting for 57.78% of the total volume of assets.</p>



<p>Storj, the platform runs on the Ethereum blockchain and allows anyone to store files without having to navigate a centralized data center. It will enable users to rent excess space and reliably store and return data for a low fee.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Cardano&#8217;s TVL in DeFi reaches an all-time high, indicating a growing interest in Cardano&#8217;s DeFi ecosystem.</em></li>



<li><em>Cardano stands out as one of the few protocols with a positive development trajectory in the DeFi space.</em></li>



<li><em>Despite positive growth, ADA faces regulatory challenges from the US SEC, which classified ADA as a security token.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cardano (ADA) is seeing its positive growth towards decentralized finance (DeFi), while the current price movement remains largely unchanged.</strong></h5>

<p>According to data from the <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Cardano?currency=ADA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DeFiLlama</a> aggregator, ADA Total Value Locked (TVL) across DeFi ecosystems has risen to an all-time high, with the increase being maintained steadily from the start of 2023 to present. </p>



<p>At the present time, TVL on DeFi platforms reaches over $210 million, representing 2% of the current total supply of <a href="https://coincu.com/199869-what-will-cardano-do-at-the-0-3-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ADA</a>. It is still one of the coins with the highest market capitalization in the crypto market.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Although this amount is not being supplemented in Dollar terms because of the token&#8217;s price drop, it does demonstrate how much interest investors have in the Cardano DeFi universe.</p>



<p>The statistics revealed that although many blockchain protocols paint a rosy picture of a booming DeFi world, real-world facts suggest that Cardano is one of the only protocols with a positive development trajectory.</p>



<p>If the measure just tracked the number of mentions, a thread with a high number of mentions may boost the count on its own, even if mentions were low elsewhere on social media. As a result, to gain a more accurate reflection of the trend in the larger market, the social volume only takes into account unique postings.</p>



<p>However, in terms of macro factors, <a href="https://coincu.com/195399-cardano-saw-the-biggest-drop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cardano</a> is facing unfavorable factors from the US authorities, namely the U.S. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has designated ADA as a security token in its lawsuits with US exchanges, which caused its price to plummet in early June.</p>

<p>Revolut is also moving to delist ADA in the United States after the token were listed as securities by the <a href="https://coincu.com/199277-sec-says-bitcoin-etf-inadequate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEC</a> last month, causing a decline in ADA trading volume on centralized exchange platforms.</p>

<p>STORJ is the native token of Storj, which uses blockchain technology and peer-to-peer protocols to provide private, encrypted, decentralized, and secure cloud storage.</p>



<p>The project&#8217;s white paper was first published in 2014, and the latest version of Storj was released in 2019. Shawn Wilkinson and John Quinn co-founded Storj Labs, the company behind the Storj platform, in 2014. Originally, Storj was launched on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, but in 2017 it switched to Ethereum.</p>



<p>That same year, Storj Labs raised 910 BTC (about $460,000) in a public sale. Then in 2017, the company raised $3 million in seed funding only to raise $30 million in a token sale later that year. The project has the backing of venture capital firms such as Google Ventures, Qualcomm Ventures, and Techstars Ventures.</p>



<p>Out of a total supply of 424,999.998 million STORJ tokens, currently, 408,576,965 million STORJ tokens are circulating in the market with a market capitalization of $205,380,775.</p>



<p>Powered by blockchain technology, decentralized storage solutions like Filecoin, Storj, and Arweave slice your data into small pieces and then store the packets on linked pseudo-computers (nodes) with a decentralized network. Here, files are protected by a network that includes many different stakeholders instead of a single company.</p>
