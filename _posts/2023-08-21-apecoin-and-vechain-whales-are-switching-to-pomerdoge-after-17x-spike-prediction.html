<p class="s4">It did attempt to recover in the past week with a 3.1% increase, but its decrease has been higher. According to the VeChain price prediction, it can reach $0.023 by the end of the year.</p>
Pomerdoge (POMD) to Spike 17x
<p class="s4">With the recent bearish performance behind ApeCoin and VeChain, whales began to diversify. The main cryptocurrency they've switched to is Pomerdoge (POMD). It's a unique ecosystem that combines the best elements of meme-coins and the Play-to-Earn (P2E) sector to provide an innovative experience.</p>
<p class="s4">There are three main components behind it, including Pomergame, Pomerplace, and an NFT collection. Pomergame is a virtual world where players can explore and finish objectives in order to get virtual rewards or items of value. They are rewarded for their time committed to the game. Each player has a character called a Pomer.</p>
<p class="s4">Once a Pomer reaches gold status, it can then enable them to enter the Pomerplace. This is the dedicated marketplace in which anyone can buy, sell or trade valuables. However, it also features an Arena where players can compete. Subsequently, there's a 7,777 NFT collection, where anyone who holds the POMD token can buy each NFT for 0.2 ETH.</p>
<p class="s4">During the early presale period, Pomerdoge (POMD) trades at just $0.008. However, analysts are bullish on its future and predict that it can spike in value by 17x at launch. &nbsp;</p>
