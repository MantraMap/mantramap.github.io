										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>According to<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-05/jpmorgan-to-use-blockchain-to-settle-usd-fx-trades-in-india-hub?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=share&amp;utm_campaign=twitter"> Bloomberg News</a>, JP Morgan &amp; Chase Co., the renowned Wall Street giant, is set to launch a blockchain-based system in India for real-time settlement of interbank dollar transactions. The system will undergo a pilot phase to evaluate the experience of participating banks. <br /><br />The initiative is being carried out in collaboration with six of India&#8217;s largest banks, including HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Yes Bank, IndusInd Bank, and JP Morgan&#8217;s local unit.<br /><br />The primary purpose of <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/jp-morgan-formally-registers-crypto-trademark/">JP Morgan</a>&#8216;s blockchain settlement system will be to settle interbank dollar transactions in Gujarat International Finance Tec-City, also known as GIFT City. GIFT City is India&#8217;s ambitious endeavor to establish an international financial and trade hub that rivals Dubai and Singapore.<br /><br />Currently, the domestic non-deliverable forward market in GIFT City operates using a traditional banking system that takes several hours to settle transactions and is inactive on weekends and public holidays. JP Morgan aims to replace this legacy settlement system with its new blockchain project, leveraging its proprietary blockchain platform Onyx, if the pilot phase proves successful. This transition will enable real-time settlement of transactions at any time, significantly improving efficiency.<br /><br />Kaustubh Kulkarni, the senior country officer for India and vice chairman of Asia Pacific at JP Morgan, emphasized the benefits of blockchain technology, stating, &#8220;By leveraging blockchain technology to facilitate transactions on a 24&#215;7 basis, processing is instantaneous and enables GIFT City banks to support their own time zone and operating hours.&#8221;<br /><br />JP Morgan has been actively exploring blockchain technology since 2014, participating in various blockchain initiatives led by traditional banks. <br /><br />Although it left the R3 consortium in 2017, the company established its blockchain unit and launched Onyx in 2020. Onyx offers a range of blockchain-based services for financial institutions, including secure data sharing, multi-currency transfers and clearing, and tokenization of traditional assets into digital form.<br /><br />Furthermore, Onyx provides a platform for institutions seeking to develop their proprietary blockchains.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In a significant development, the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/u-s-congress-to-address-stablecoin-legislation-and-sec-oversight/">US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) </a>has filed a lawsuit against Binance, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, and its CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ), <a href="https://www.docdroid.net/I02zzqT/sec-v-binance-4-pdf#page=86">alleging</a> that several popular cryptocurrencies offered on the platform are unregistered securities.<br /><br />Notable cryptocurrencies mentioned in the lawsuit include Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Polygon (MATIC). The seriousness of the situation is further emphasized as the lawsuit identifies Binance&#8217;s native token BNB and the BUSD stablecoin as securities.<br /><br />The lawsuit goes on to list a range of other crypto assets that are allegedly considered securities, such as FIL, ATOM, SAND, MANA, ALGO, AXS, and COTI. Additionally, the SEC points out that Binance has listed tokens that have previously faced enforcement actions by the regulatory body, including AMP, REP, UST, and TRX. This suggests a pattern of potential disregard for securities regulations on the part of Binance.<br /><br />It is worth noting that Ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC) are not included in the list of alleged unregistered securities. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has previously indicated that while Bitcoin (BTC) is viewed as a commodity, the majority of existing tokens are considered unregistered securities by the SEC.<br /><br />The lawsuit specifically accuses <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/binance-faces-doj-investigation-for-alleged-violation-of-russian-sanctions/">Binance </a>of offering unregistered securities trading platforms, engaging in the sale of unregistered crypto asset securities, and maintaining secret control over its US operations to enable high-value US customers to bypass restrictions. It further alleges improper commingling and diversion of billions of dollars in customer funds by Binance.<br /><br />This legal action by the SEC against Binance and CZ underscores the increasing regulatory scrutiny faced by cryptocurrency exchanges and the need for compliance with securities laws. The outcome of the lawsuit will have significant implications for the crypto industry as a whole and could potentially shape future regulations and practices in the market.</p>

<p>Reports have emerged of millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency missing from users&#8217; self-custodial <a href="https://twitter.com/atomicwallet/status/1664946301815910400?s=46">Atomic Wallet</a>, raising concerns within the crypto community. The project has acknowledged the compromise and is actively investigating the apparent vulnerability. Many users took to Twitter to share their experiences with drained wallet contents, expressing fear and disappointment in Atomic Wallet&#8217;s security measures.<br /><br />Atomic Wallet, which boasts over 5 million downloads, has assured users that it is collaborating with leading security companies and reaching out to analytics firms and exchanges to trace the stolen funds. However, the exact method of the attack remains unclear at this time. Some users claim to have transferred their funds to other wallets in time, avoiding losses, while others have sadly lost their entire cryptocurrency holdings.<br /><br />Atomic Wallet prides itself on its security features, as it does not have access to users&#8217; private keys, which are encrypted and stored locally. However, an auditing firm called Least Authority previously raised concerns about the platform&#8217;s security measures in protecting user assets and private data.<br /><br />Investigative work by<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-blockchain-marks-14th-anniversary/"> blockchain</a> sleuth ZachXBT has identified over $35 million worth of stolen funds, with one victim losing nearly $8 million in Tether. The incident has had a significant impact on the price of Atomic Wallet&#8217;s ERC-20 token AWC, which has experienced a decline of over 96% since its all-time high in May 2021.<br /><br />The cryptocurrency industry as a whole has seen an increase in attacks, with hacks accounting for the majority of funds lost. In the first quarter of 2023 alone, an estimated $440 million was stolen across 73 incidents, surpassing losses from scams and other malicious activities.<br /><br />There is a glimmer of hope for the victims of the Atomic Wallet exploit, as some funds have been recovered through the collaboration of ZachXBT, Jito Labs&#8217; pseudonymous CEO Buffalo, and an employee at an MEV infrastructure company. However, the team is cautious about sharing their methodology, as it could potentially lead to further losses for other victims. Despite the challenges, Buffalo remains optimistic that their solution can provide assistance and support to those affected by the hack.<br /><br />The Atomic Wallet incident serves as a reminder of the importance of robust security measures within the crypto industry and the need for constant vigilance to protect user funds.</p>

<p>During a recent <em>&#8220;ask me anything&#8221;</em> session, Changpeng &#8220;CZ&#8221; Zhao, the<a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/from-cz/highlights-from-czs-may-31-ama-on-twitter-spaces-5836943572184518316"> CEO of Binance</a>, a leading cryptocurrency ecosystem, discussed various topics including his daily routine, the prospects of Web3 in Dubai, and Binance&#8217;s roadmap. One notable highlight was CZ&#8217;s clarification that Binance has no intention to engage in Bitcoin mining. <br /><br />He explained that the mining business requires significant hardware and expertise, and there are already many competitors with a stronger advantage in that sector. However, Binance will continue to operate its mining pool, which should not be mistaken for direct hash mining.<br /><br />Binance Pool currently ranks as the fifth-largest pool in the Bitcoin network, contributing approximately 28.96 EHashes per second, or around 7.71% of the net Bitcoin network hashrate as of June 2023. Notably, Binance Pool boasts the lowest commission per block (7.01%) among the top 10 mining pools, according to <a href="https://btc.com/stats/pool">BTC.com</a> statistics.<br /><br />Aside from Bitcoin mining, CZ also addressed the integration of the Lightning Network (LN), a second-layer solution for Bitcoin based on payment channels. He acknowledged that directly implementing LN into Binance&#8217;s existing infrastructure poses security challenges, as the platform relies on pre-generated Bitcoin addresses for safe key management, which is not feasible with LN. However, Binance plans to initiate testing for Lightning integration with small amounts of money. CZ believes that eventually, all exchanges will integrate this tool, as LN enables faster and cheaper Bitcoin transactions compared to the L1 (Layer 1) network.<br /><br />CZ also expressed admiration for the progress of the Web3 sector in Dubai and revealed that Binance has a growing presence in the city, currently employing 700 people. He acknowledged Dubai&#8217;s emergence as a significant hub for innovation in Web3, cryptocurrencies, and blockchain technology.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbase-derivatives-exchange-will-launch-institutional-sized-bitcoin-and">Coinbase</a>, a popular cryptocurrency exchange, announced on its website that it will be launching Bitcoin and Ethereum futures contracts for institutional investors on June 5. These products will be available through the Coinbase Derivative Exchange, which is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and will offer lower fees compared to other US-regulated derivatives exchanges. <br /><br />To facilitate seamless access to these contracts, Coinbase has partnered with leading Futures Commission Merchants (FCMs), brokers, and front-end providers.<br /><br />According to the statement, the Coinbase Bitcoin (BTI) and Coinbase Ether (ETI) futures contracts will be accessible through third-party institutional FCMs and brokers. The contracts will be available in sizes of 1 Bitcoin and 10 Ether, providing investors with the ability to manage their portfolios more effectively. This move comes after Coinbase recently introduced nano bitcoin (BIT) and nano Ether (ET) contracts.<br /><br />Coinbase aims to empower institutional participants with greater precision in managing their cryptocurrency exposure, expressing directional views, or tracking Bitcoin and Ether returns in a capital-efficient manner through the launch of these institutional-sized USD-settled contracts.<br /><br />In recent months, Coinbase has been exploring more crypto-friendly jurisdictions for its offerings. As part of this effort, the company obtained a license in <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/coinbase-gains-regulatory-approval-to-operate-in-bermuda/">Bermuda</a>, a jurisdiction with crypto regulations in place since 2018. Coinbase established the Coinbase International Exchange in Bermuda to cater to non-US institutional investors, offering perpetual futures contracts. Additionally, Coinbase is considering options in the European Union and the UK to establish its base.<br /><br />While Coinbase maintains its commitment to the US market, it has faced regulatory challenges. Recently, regulators indicated a potential investigation into the company&#8217;s staking services, classifying them as unregulated securities. Coinbase has <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/we-asked-the-sec-for-reasonable-crypto-rules-for-americans-we-got-legal">denied</a> these claims.<br /><br />The regulatory scrutiny of crypto firms in the US has intensified in recent months, especially after the collapse of FTX. To maintain their leadership position in the crypto industry, major players like Coinbase must explore opportunities beyond the US, considering the ongoing downturn and increased regulatory scrutiny in the domestic market.</p>

<p>On <a href="https://twitter.com/BlockchainAssn/status/1664667986651758593">June 2</a>, the Blockchain Association announced that it had submitted an amicus brief to back CoinCenter&#8217;s case in defense of <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/tether-declines-to-block-tornado-cash-addresses/">Tornado Cash</a>, a coin mixer. Kristin Smith, the CEO of the Blockchain Association, emphasized that Tornado Cash is merely a tool, and penalizing the tool itself contradicts the fundamental values on which the United States was built. The association stands in solidarity with Coin Center and supports the responsible and lawful use of blockchain technology.<br /><br />Marisa <a href="https://twitter.com/MTCoppel/status/1664667432731004937">Tashman Coppel,</a> the Policy Counsel for the Blockchain Association, provided additional commentary, asserting that the Treasury and the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) do not have legal grounds to impose sanctions on software like Tornado Cash. She argued that OFAC&#8217;s authority is limited to sanctioning individuals and property. <br /><br />Tashman Coppel explained that Tornado Cash does not qualify as property since it is not owned by any specific entity. She maintained that this argument holds even if Tornado Cash&#8217;s DAO is considered a person, as the protocol itself is entirely separate from the DAO and would exist independently.<br /><br />Tashman Coppel contended that OFAC&#8217;s actions violated free speech rights and due process by sanctioning the Tornado Cash coin mixer protocol without providing adequate notice to users before imposing restrictions. The Treasury and OFAC are expected to respond before the court issues a ruling.<br /><br />The Blockchain Association&#8217;s amicus brief pertains to Coin Center&#8217;s lawsuit against OFAC and its defense of Tornado Cash. This lawsuit was initiated in October 2022. Previously, in September 2022, six individuals, including Ethereum developer Preston Van Loon, Joseph Van Loon, and two Coinbase employees, filed a lawsuit against OFAC&#8217;s treatment of Tornado Cash.<br /><br />The Blockchain Association also filed an amicus brief in support of Van Loon et al. in April. Tashman Coppel stated that similar arguments were presented in both briefs. On May 24, 2023, the plaintiffs in Van Loon et al. submitted additional arguments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Last week witnessed a devastating 20% crash in the price of the Multichain token, triggered by reports of problematic withdrawals. The precise cause of the transaction backlog in the Multichain token remains a mystery, although two theories have emerged.<br /><br />Initially, it was believed that a poorly executed system update was responsible for the deposits and withdrawals of MULTI getting stuck, causing significant delays. However, rumors began circulating like wildfire, suggesting that the development team had been arrested in Shanghai.<br /><br />While these speculations are yet to be confirmed, the Multichain team has since acknowledged that their CEO is <a href="https://twitter.com/MultichainOrg/status/1663941611380965376">missing,</a> leaving the developers without the necessary access to conduct server maintenance, which could account for the prolonged downtime.<br /><br />During this period, an unknown user transferred $2.75 million worth of MULTI to Gate.io, raising concerns about a potential connection between the two platforms.<br /><br />In the following week, additional assets purportedly belonging to members of the Multichain team were reportedly transferred to Gate.io. Notably, a series of transactions involving approximately $10 million worth of Fantom took place.<br /><br />As the Multichain team finds itself in a precarious situation, wild accusations have been thrown around, with Gate.io being singled out for allegedly assisting and harboring the Multichain team.<br /><br />To address these mounting concerns, Gate.io released a statement to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-31/crypto-exchange-gate-io-rejects-rumors-that-sank-related-token">Bloomberg</a>, denying any involvement in the matter and clarifying their recent activities. According to Gate.io&#8217;s spokesperson, the platform&#8217;s employees are primarily focused on preparations for the platform&#8217;s upcoming 10th anniversary and handling essential paperwork, particularly obtaining a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license required for their new Hong Kong-focused trading platform.<br /><br />The <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/gate-io-launches-crypto-exchange-gatetr-in-turkey/">Gate.io</a> spokesperson also took the opportunity to provide a glimpse of upcoming plans for the Gate community, including a series of &#8220;user campaigns&#8221; to celebrate the platform&#8217;s decade-long existence.<br /><br />Following the controversy, the analytics platform Lookonchain decided to publish an updated report on the assets stored on Gate.io&#8217;s platform, aiming to shed light on the situation.</p>

<p>While <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-soars-past-28000-amid-renewed-banking-concerns-from-first-republic/">Bitcoin</a>&#8216;s price remains trapped within a narrow range, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency is witnessing an unprecedented challenge in its mining arena. Network fundamentals are painting an overwhelmingly bullish picture for Bitcoin.<br /><br />Recent data from <a href="https://btc.com/stats/diff">BTC.com</a> reveals a surge in Bitcoin mining difficulty, reaching a remarkable milestone of 50.68 trillion. This new all-time high was achieved through a 3.4% increase at block height 792,288 on May 31st. It marks the first time Bitcoin has surpassed the 50 trillion difficulty level.<br /><br />The robust conviction and competition among miners are further underscored by the network&#8217;s hash rate, which is hovering near its peak at 400 EH/s. Leading the pack is Foundry USA, contributing the highest market share of 28.9% in hash rate, followed by Antpool at 22.6% and F2Pool with a dominant 14.1% share.<br /><br />This surge in mining difficulty comes as a relief for Bitcoin miners, who faced significant challenges during the market turmoil of the previous year. The recent craze around NFTs contributed to their respite by driving transaction fees.<br /><br />Mining revenue hit a five-year high last month in an extraordinary turn of events. Driven by the popularity of NFTs, miners are now actively deploying more mining machines, thus boosting the network&#8217;s computational power. <br /><br />Additionally, Bitcoin mining-related stocks in the United States experienced gains this week as President Joe Biden agreed to abandon the proposed 30% tax on electricity used by these companies.<br /><br />Riot Platforms emerged as the leading gainer among major mining stocks, followed closely by Iris Energy, Hive Blockchain, Cleanspark, Hut 8 Mining and Marathon Digital Holding.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/binance-accused-of-deliberately-flouting-laws-by-cftc-chief/">Binance</a>, the leading cryptocurrency exchange, has recently laid off a portion of its workforce amidst a decline in its market share. In response to a tweet by <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1663890209526927373">Wu Blockchain</a> regarding the layoffs, a Binance spokesperson explained that the company periodically reviews its talent allocation to ensure optimal team composition and resource allocation. <br /><br />Consequently, some employees who are underperforming or not fitting the organizational culture may be let go.<br /><br />The spokesperson clarified that this move is not a case of rightsizing, but rather a reevaluation of the expertise and talent required in critical roles. <br /><br />Binance intends to fill hundreds of open positions to align with the evolving demands of users and regulators. Although the exact number of employees affected was not disclosed, the exchange confirmed that it had a headcount of around 8,000 before the layoffs.<br /><br />Interestingly, these layoffs follow Binance&#8217;s previous statement in March, where they stated they had no plans for layoffs and were actively seeking to fill 500 additional positions by the end of June. Even now, Binance still has over 300 open positions advertised on its website.<br /><br />In January, Binance&#8217;s CEO, Changpeng Zhao, expressed plans to increase staff numbers by 15% to 30% in 2023, stating their commitment to building and preparing for the next bull market. However, recent reports have indicated a declining market share for Binance, coinciding with decreasing trading volumes. It is worth noting that regulatory actions taken against Binance and Zhao in the United States in March might have contributed to this decline.<br /><br />Responding to concerns about the layoffs, Zhao mentioned on <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1663945939482968075">Twitter</a> that Binance follows a program called &#8216;bottom out,&#8217; which involves parting ways with individuals who do not align with the company&#8217;s unique culture or situation. He emphasized that this program is an ongoing process and that the company does not have specific targets for employee departures.<br /><br />Despite the layoffs, Binance remains optimistic about the future. The company&#8217;s spokesperson reiterated their commitment to delivering for users and expressed excitement about the growth and innovation within the Binance ecosystem. They also clarified that the layoffs were not cost-cutting measures.<br /><br />Binance spokesperson<a href="https://twitter.com/PRHillmann/status/1663925657611403264?s=20"> Patrick Hillmann</a> further explained on Twitter that the company regularly conducts talent density audits and resource allocation exercises every six months or so. He emphasized that these exercises aim to streamline operations and ensure efficiency within the organization. However, he did not provide a specific number of layoffs, highlighting that the focus is on directing resources where they are needed most.<br /><br />In summary, Binance has decided to lay off a portion of its workforce as it evaluates talent allocation and streamlines operations. Despite the decline in market share and recent regulatory challenges, the company remains committed to its users and is optimistic about its future growth and innovation.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ltc-price-analysis-how-far-will-rapid-whale-accumulation-take-ltc-price-litecoin-ranks-top-payment-option-on-bitpay/">Litecoin</a> is gearing up for its highly anticipated third mining reward halving scheduled for early August. Following this event, the per-block reward paid to miners will be reduced by 50%, from 12.5 LTC to 6.25 LTC. In anticipation of the halving, the twelfth largest cryptocurrency by market value has witnessed significant gains, pushing its price to $92.58.<br /><br />On-chain metrics have also shown positive trends for Litecoin. Data from <a href="https://twitter.com/intotheblock/status/1663472029050306560">IntoTheBlock</a> reveals a surge in the total address count with a balance since the end of April, reaching an impressive 8.5 million LTC addresses with a balance last week. <br /><br />Both new and active address counts have hovered near all-time highs established in February, with new addresses briefly surpassing those of Bitcoin.<br /><br />Crypto-analytic platform<a href="https://insights.santiment.net/read/litecoin-s-ltc20-is-less-than-3-months-out-how-big-of-a-deal-is-it-7307"> Santiment</a> highlights the increased on-chain volume as a strong indicator that significant players are entering the LTC market in anticipation of the halving. They believe this event will have a positive impact on Litecoin&#8217;s price.<br /><br />Furthermore, Litecoin&#8217;s hash rate has remained consistent, experiencing a growth of over 24% since the beginning of the year, reaching 712 TH/s. The mining difficulty stands at 25.12 million hashes, closely aligned with the hash rate.<br /><br />The upcoming halving has also influenced Litecoin&#8217;s futures derivatives contracts, which have <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/currencies/LTC">surged</a> by over $420 million globally, resulting in a year-to-date growth of over 20%. This surge in interest has pushed Litecoin Futures&#8217; open interest to its highest level since the beginning of last year.<br /><br />As the halving approaches, Litecoin continues to show promising signs in its on-chain metrics and futures contracts, building anticipation for the event and its potential impact on the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price.</p>
