Ray III, said he is looking into the prospect of restarting the bankrupt crypto exchange while working to restore money to the failing company&#8217;s clients and creditors. <strong>Mr Ray said that he has set up a task force to explore restarting FTX.com, the company’s main international exchange.</strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">Everything is on the table, if there is a path forward on that, then we will not only explore that, we’ll do it.</p>
<cite>Mr. Ray said</cite></blockquote>



<p>Ray will also <strong>investigate if restoring FTX&#8217;s international exchange would recover more value</strong> for the company&#8217;s consumers than liquidating assets or selling the platform, according to the article.</p>



<p>Following the interview of John J. Ray III, the former CEO of FTX has published a new tweet, saying that he is glad to hear Ray turning the exchange back on after months. He then said <strong>still waiting for the admittance of FTX US being solvent to give customers their money back.</strong></p>

</div></figure>



<p><strong>Ray and Bankman-Fried are in conflict over the bankruptcy filing of the exchange</strong>. Bankman-Fried has stated that FTX&#8217;s filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection was a mistake, and he has criticized Ray&#8217;s handling of the situation. Ray called Bankman-remarks Fried&#8217;s <strong>unhelpful and self-serving</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Gateway is a protocol that uses web3 technology to verify credentials</strong>, update their status, and ensure user sovereignty and data privacy.</p>



<p><strong>Rahman and Sanket Jain launched Gateway in 2021</strong> with the goal of decentralizing credential issuing and management. Credentials are proof that a person possesses a certain characteristic or competence. </p>



<p>In the old world, credentials, such as diplomas from governments and institutions, are generally issued physically and kept by centralized entities. <strong>Credentials are maintained on the blockchain in a web3 world and are frequently issued as tokens such as NFTs.</strong></p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/203706/web3-credential-protocol-gateway-raises-4-2-million-exclusive?utm_source=telegram1&amp;utm_medium=social" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.theblock.co/post/203706/web3-credential-protocol-gateway-raises-4-2-million-exclusive?utm_source=telegram1&amp;utm_medium=social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Block</a>, <strong>the firm began raising funds for the round early last year and completed it by the second quarter</strong>, but opted to disclose it now owing to the previous year&#8217;s crypto failures.</p>

<p><strong>The firm provides a decentralized credential application</strong>. The dapp provides a no-code platform for web3 companies to establish and issue credentials for their communities. </p>



<p>Gateway is also developing an <strong>SDK</strong> and an <strong>API</strong> that will allow its clients to incorporate the protocol directly into their projects in order to issue credentials natively. The <strong>SDK documentation</strong> and initial use cases will be available in the first quarter of this year.</p>

<p>Once connected to NEAR using the <strong>Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)</strong>, Composable will be able to promote and speed up the adoption of <strong>Centauri</strong> and its infrastructure. The protocol&#8217;s ultimate goal is to provide sustainable ways for cooperation among various DeFi ecosystems.</p>



<p><strong>0xbrainjar</strong>, Founder &amp; CEO of Composable Finance, stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“We are driven by the vision of a collaborative and connected DeFi future and are always excited when prominent ecosystems come together and align on this vision. The NEAR ecosystem has an impressive community of developers and users, and we’re keen to see what they can accomplish for DeFi once they are integrated into Centauri and the rest of our interoperable infrastructure.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Once <strong>Centauri</strong> has connected to <strong>NEAR</strong>, the grant will be used to pay the bridging costs for transactions made by the bridge&#8217;s initial users. The protocol and the NEAR team have been working together to put a light client version of <strong>GRANDPA</strong> on the NEAR network.</p>

<p><strong>BitKeep</strong> is expected that <strong>50% of the funds will be paid by the end of February</strong>, and the remaining funds will be paid by the end of March. As for the compensation currency, due to the fluctuation of the currency price, the asset valuation of the compensation will be converted into <strong>USDT</strong>, but the specific compensation details need to wait for the compensation application page to go online, and the compensation page shall prevail. <strong>BitKeep</strong> once again promised to pay all victims in full.</p>



<p><strong>BitKeep</strong> explained that the reason for not being able to pay before the year is that it is difficult to pay, and the damaged funds may be stolen. The technical team and the security agency have used multiple dimensions, such as the stolen user&#8217;s wallet address, stolen amount, currency, and time. Closed-loop verification of information has been completed, and a rigorous application verification scheme has been designed.</p>

<p>As Coincu <a href="https://news.coincu.com/155368-bitkeep-users-wallets-stolen-due-security/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, the <strong>Bitkeep</strong> vulnerability that happened on <strong>December 26</strong> employed phishing sites to trick users into installing fraudulent wallets. The attacker created a number of fictitious Bitkeep websites that each hosted an APK file that seemed to be <strong>Bitkeep wallet version 7.2.9</strong>. Users&#8217; private keys or seed words were taken when <strong>they &#8220;updated&#8221; their wallets by downloading the malicious file</strong>, and they were delivered to the attacker. </p>



<p>After that, the platform&#8217;s services are also interrupted to make sure there are no other errors.

<p>From <strong>1983</strong> through <strong>1988</strong>, the <strong>Weekly Shonen Jump magazine</strong> featured the manga series <strong>Fist of the North Star</strong>,<strong> </strong>which was authored by <strong>Takeru Takemono </strong>(original story) and <strong>Tetsuo Hara</strong> (manga).</p>



<p>The gritty action manga is set at the turn of the century and follows <strong>Kenshiro</strong>, a master of<strong> Hokuto Shinken</strong>, as he battles evil in a violent post-nuclear world. This masterpiece is still adored by many fans both in Japan and abroad and is one of the best-selling manga series of all time, with a total global circulation of over <strong>100 million copies.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Tetsuo Hara</strong>, the author of the famous manga, said in a <a href="https://sandboxgame.medium.com/fist-of-the-north-star-and-the-sandbox-partner-for-end-of-the-century-land-85ad11b17464" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“I am looking forward to seeing the world of the manga “Fist of the North Star” come to life in the new gaming metaverse. It’s a little strange to be a voxel, but I’m really looking forward to seeing Kenshiro and the rest of the Hokuto characters come to life and run wild.”</p>

These leases are often returned to <strong>Ripple</strong>. The total number of unpaid leases as of <strong>Q3 2022 </strong>was <strong>91.1 million XRP</strong>. What safeguards are in place if a counterparty fails to repay leased XRP is not yet known.</p>

<p>Notably, <strong>Garlinghouse</strong> made this statement when he disclosed that <strong>he had spoken with SBF a few days before the exchange declared bankruptcy</strong>.

<ul>
<li><em>The largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, Binance, was identified as a counterparty in an order against the obscure cryptocurrency exchange, Bitzlato, which was charged by US authorities with laundering $700 million.</em></li>



<li><em>The authorities emphasized that in addition to Binance, TheFiniko and Russian darknet Hydra were among the major receiving counterparties of Bitzlato.</em></li>



<li><em>Following the adoption of the eighth round of sanctions by the European Union on Russia, Binance was one of the exchanges that decided to keep on serving non-sanctioned Russians.</em></li>

<p>The largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/161227-binance-just-burned-600-million-usd-bnb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a>, was listed as a counterparty in an order against the obscure cryptocurrency exchange, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/161343-doj-files-action-against-bitzlato/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitzlato</a>, which was charged on Wednesday with attempting to launder $700 million.</p>



<p>On January 18, the US government initiated enforcement procedures against the obscure exchange. <strong>Anatoly Legkodymov</strong>, the exchange&#8217;s creator from Russia, was detained in <strong>Miami</strong>.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/Order_Bitzlato_FINAL%20508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FinCEN report</a>, over two-thirds of Bitzlato&#8217;s top sending and receiving counterparties were connected to scams or darknet markets. The authorities said that in addition to Binance, <strong>TheFiniko</strong> and the Russian darknet service <strong>Hydra</strong> were among the main receiving counterparties of <strong>Bitzlato</strong>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>However, Binance was not included by <strong>FinCEN</strong> as one of the top three transmitting counterparties in the order. <strong>TheFiniko</strong> and <strong>Hydra</strong>, Finland-based exchange <strong>LocalBitcoins</strong> were the largest Bitcoin senders to Bitzlato <strong>between</strong> <strong>May 2018 and September 2022</strong>, according to the paper.</p>



<p><strong>Bitzlato</strong> obtained cryptocurrency worth <strong>$206 million</strong> from darknet marketplaces <strong>between 2019 and 2021</strong>, <strong>$224 million from con artists</strong>, and<strong> $9 million from ransomware perpetrators</strong>. The corporation was officially designated by <strong>FinCEN</strong> as a main money-laundering concern, which often excludes a company from the global banking system.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1143.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="900" height="506" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1143.png" alt="Binance Presents In Top 3 Counterparties Of Bitzlato" class="wp-image-161447" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1143.png 900w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1143-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1143-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1143-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" title="Binance Presents In Top 3 Counterparties Of Bitzlato 28"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">   </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The decision aims to forbid any domestic financial institution or all covered financial institutions from transmitting cash via <strong>Bitzlato</strong> since it has played a significant part in managing illegal transactions for Russian ransomware perpetrators.</p>



<p>Because <strong>Binance was one of the exchanges that decided to continue to provide services to non-sanctioned Russians</strong> after the European Union adopted the eighth sanctions package against the country, the exchange&#8217;s alleged involvement in Bitzlato&#8217;s case raises some questions about the exchange&#8217;s operations and potential ties with <strong>Russia</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Dookey Dash</strong> is part of <a href="https://news.coincu.com/156254-yuga-labs-sued-artist-denies-allegations/">Yuga Labs</a>&#8216; plan to <strong>expand the Metaverse ecosystem;</strong> the game genre is influenced by popular mainstream video games such as Subway Surfers and Temple Run. Owners of NFT BAYC and MAYC will be able to apply for <strong>Sewer Passes on January 17</strong> and begin playing <strong>Dookey Dash on January 19.</strong> Non-NFT holders, according to Yuga Labs, can acquire back sewer passes from the<strong> OpenSea NFT marketplace.</strong></p>



<p>Soon after Sewer Passes went public, it registered a transaction volume of more over <strong>4,000 ETH (equal to more than $6 million) in just a few hours, </strong>confirming the project&#8217;s significant appeal. As a result, the sewer passageways are separated into four categories according to whether or not the proprietor is <strong>a BAY extension</strong> . MAYC NFT may or may not have <strong>Bored Ape Kennel Club NFT in its portfolio</strong>.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, the lowest pricing for Tier one sewer passes on OpenSea<strong> is 1.3 ETH (about $1,970), with a Tier four card available for up to 420 ETH (roughly $640,000).</strong></p>

<p>Notably, the Twitter community discovered that Sewer Passes has a number of disorders encrypted in its clever contract, including a block record of wallet addresses sourced from other NFT exchanges such as<strong> LooksRare, NFTX, Blur, and LooksRare swap is a shell command.</strong></p>



<p>This decision has sparked heated debate on Twitter, with the great majority of users understanding that Yuga Labs is <strong>upholding a flat 5% fee paid to its artists. </strong>Offshore, as opposed to optional award authorisation for buyers such as LooksRare or Blur.</p>



<p>&#8220;OpenSea provides copyright retention enforcement for developers of new tasks,&#8221; said the OpenSea developer. This is accomplished by incorporating a simple piece of code into the NFT contract that restricts the sale of NFTs to specific markets.</p>



<p>Wylie Arnow, co-founder of Yuga Labs, has been vocal about protecting creators&#8217; copyrights, noting, &#8220;Coding anything into your NFT smart contract will assist creators ensure they collect royalties.&#8221;</p>

<p>The city plans to take advantage of Busan’s rich cultural content, such as the <strong>Busan International Film Festival</strong> and <strong>G-Star</strong>, to tokenize assets such as movies, game IP, gold, precious metals, agricultural products, livestock products, ships, and real estate in decentralized digital goods. The exchange conducts transactions and is scheduled to begin operations within <strong>2023</strong>.</p>



<p>According to the report, the plan is that by bringing together the capabilities of domestic financial companies and digital asset exchanges that have expressed their intention to participate in the establishment of the <strong>Busan Digital Asset Exchange</strong>, the committee will establish a transaction support system in the near future.</p>

<p>The <strong>Busan Digital Asset Exchange</strong> has a decentralized fair exchange structure that is distinct from existing domestic virtual asset exchanges to protect investors thickly and lead digital innovation in various ways.</p>



<p>The exchange system is designed as a decentralized fair exchange system in which functions such as deposit settlement, listing evaluation, and market monitoring are separated into separate institutions like the existing stock trading system. The city expects that <strong>the exchange will serve as a foundation for expansion in the form of supporting virtual assets and security token transactions in the future.</strong></p>



<p>The promotion committee plans to speed up the follow-up work of the business within the year, such as preparations for the establishment of a legal person in <strong>February</strong> and the start of system testing.</p>

<p><a href="https://news.coincu.com/158599-okx-review-cryptocurrency-exchange/">OKX </a>holds <strong>$7.5 billion in reserves</strong>, which do not include its native tokens; the exchange is overcollateralized, with a reserve ratio of <strong>105% for BTC</strong>, <strong>105% for ETH</strong>, and <strong>105% for USDT</strong>. The current <strong>gold rate is 101%</strong>.</p>



<p>The exact portfolio is OKX&#8217;s response to CryptoQuant&#8217;s development of a metric to measure <strong>the &#8220;cleanliness&#8221; of reserves</strong>. CryptoQuant defines it as an exchange&#8217;s reliance on its native token. The platform&#8217;s reserves, according to CryptoQuant, are completely clean. Meanwhile, Binance has <strong>87% clean reserves</strong>, Bitfinex has 70% clean reserves, and Huobi has 60% clean reserves.</p>

<p>The exchange&#8217;s Chief Marketing Officer has stated that the <strong>introduction of stablecoins is not currently on the company&#8217;s to-do list</strong>. This is in contrast to other exchanges, who have introduced their own versions of the cryptocurrency despite facing a variety of challenges.</p>



<p>According to the Chief Marketing Officer, <strong>he does not feel that any trading venue, centralized or decentralized</strong>, has any business establishing their own asset that is traded. This is the case even if the commodity in question is a stable asset in which people settle. There are several instances of competing interests. Everything circles back to the concept of our indigenous tokens. He made it quite clear that a<strong> native token sale will not be included into the structure of the platform in any way</strong>.</p>



<p>The exchange does operate a venture fund, which is known as <strong>OKX Ventures</strong>; but, as the  OKX&#8217;s Chief Marketing Officer indicated, this company has <strong>its own balance sheet and managerial staff</strong>. And because OKX Ventures is a traditional fund with a traditional structure, the firm makes investments in traditional currencies.</p>
