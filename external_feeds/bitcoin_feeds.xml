He stressed that the U.S. currency is being destroyed, emphasizing that it is losing purchasing power. </strong><strong>“Rather than fighting inflation, the Fed fueled the fire,” Schiff claimed.</strong></p>
<h2>Peter Schiff Warns U.S. Dollar Is Being Destroyed</h2>
<p>Economist and gold bug Peter Schiff issued multiple warnings on Wednesday following the Federal Reserve&#8217;s announcement of a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-reserve-raises-federal-funds-rate-by-25bps-amidst-moderate-economic-growth/">25 basis point</a> interest rate hike.</p>
<p>Responding to Fed Chair Jerome Powell&#8217;s statement that the Fed is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2023/07/26/fed-chair-powell-fed-staff-are-no-longer-forecasting-recession.html">no longer forecasting a recession</a> for the U.S. economy, Schiff said on Fox Business Wednesday:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Fed is wrong on its recession outlook. We&#8217;re going to have a recession. In fact, it&#8217;s going to be a severe one &#8230; Inflation is going to get worse, not better.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The real rate of inflation, regardless of how the government wants to misreport it &#8230; is higher than five percent,&#8221; the economist insisted.</p>
<p>Commenting on Powell&#8217;s statement regarding <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDm6I5ecaYI">rate cuts</a>, Schiff tweeted: &#8220;Powell just admitted that the Fed will start cutting rates long before inflation gets down to 2%. That&#8217;s a big admission that&#8217;s bullish for gold and bearish for the dollar and Treasuries.&#8221;</p>
<p>The gold bug also pointed out that after the rate hike announcement, the Dow Jones Industrial Average “finished higher for the 13th day in a row, its longest winning streak since 1987.” He detailed: “We all know how that year turned out. Investors ignored rising interest rates, a falling dollar, and rising budget and trade deficits until suddenly all that bad news mattered.” In a follow-up tweet on Thursday, Schiff opined: “Despite yesterday&#8217;s Fed rate hike, financial conditions in the U.S. have eased. The dollar and bond yields are down and stocks are up. Easier conditions have already pushed oil prices near $80, with more upside to come. Rather than fighting inflation, the Fed fueled the fire.”</p>

<p>Discussing what investments are best in the current environment, Schiff advised: “You don&#8217;t want to own any Treasuries, even short-term. You want to own real money, which would be gold, [and] you want dividend-paying stocks that are not in dollars — that are outside the United States.” He emphasized:</p>
<blockquote><p>You&#8217;ve got to get out of the dollar because that&#8217;s what being destroyed. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s losing purchasing power.</p></blockquote>
<p>“You want to be in anything that&#8217;s inflation sensitive,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;That&#8217;s basic materials, that&#8217;s energy, that&#8217;s agriculture &#8230; You want to be in investments that are going to benefit from the market being surprised by inflation being much higher than they expect and long-term interest rates being much higher than they expect.”</p>
<p>This was not the first time Schiff has advised everyone to get out of the U.S. dollar. In April, he made a similar recommendation, warning that the USD&#8217;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-advises-get-rid-of-your-us-dollars-now-warns-usds-reserve-currency-status-in-jeopardy/">reserve currency status is in jeopardy</a>. Earlier this month, the gold bug said the Federal Reserve has already <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/peter-schiff-the-fed-has-lost-inflation-fight-markets-just-havent-figured-that-out-yet/">lost the inflation fight</a> but the markets have not figured that out yet. He also warned that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-warns-all-banks-will-fail-people-will-suffer-massive-losses-as-banking-crisis-unfolds/">all banks will fail</a>. Last month, the economist said the U.S. dollar will decline far more than Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned, noting that Fed Chair Powell is &#8220;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-us-dollar-decline-will-be-far-greater-than-yellen-warns-fed-chair-powell-clearly-worried-about-financial-crisis/">clearly worried</a>&#8221; about a financial crisis.</p>

<h2>Robert Kiyosaki on BRICS Currency, De-Dollarization, and End of US Dollar</h2>
<p>The author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, has reiterated his warning about the end of the U.S. dollar. Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries.</p>
<p>Kiyosaki tweeted Wednesday that on Aug. 22, about 41 nations will meet in South Africa to de-dollarize the world. He expects the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) to launch a new currency called “bric,” noting that each bric unit will be equivalent to 1 oz. of gold.</p>

<p>The upcoming BRICS summit is scheduled for Aug. 22-24 in Johannesburg, with South Africa as this year&#8217;s host. Anil Sooklal, the South African diplomat overseeing BRICS relations, disclosed this week that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-interest-soars-40-countries-seek-membership-as-de-dollarization-efforts-grow/">over 40 nations</a> have expressed interest in joining the economic bloc, and 22 of them have already submitted formal applications.</p>
<p>Sooklal further revealed that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-invites-69-leaders-to-august-summit-western-countries-omitted/">69 leaders have been invited</a> to the August summit, including all of the African heads of state and the leaders of major Global South bodies. However, he pointed out that no leaders of Western countries, including French President Emmanuel Macron, have received invitations. Macron previously <a class="sc-hWhWUk dZhDeq" href="https://news.bitcoin.com/frances-macron-hopes-to-attend-brics-summit-in-south-africa-report/">expressed</a> interest in attending the BRICS summit but was met with <a class="sc-hWhWUk dZhDeq" href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russia-opposes-french-president-macron-attending-brics-summit-citing-hostile-and-unacceptable-policy-toward-moscow/">opposition</a> from Russia.</p>
<p>Moreover, the South African diplomat said that the subject of a common BRICS currency is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-currency-not-on-agenda-for-leaders-summit-nations-to-focus-on-de-dollarization/">not on the agenda</a> to be discussed at the summit, emphasizing that the BRICS bloc will focus on de-dollarization efforts and using national currencies in trade settlements.</p>

<p>In his tweet, Kiyosaki referred to the proposed BRICS currency as &#8220;bric&#8221; — the term frequently used by Jim Rickards, whom Kiyosaki referred to as his good friend and financial expert. Rickards is the author of &#8220;Sold Out: How Broken Supply Chains, Surging Inflation, and Political Instability Will Sink the Global Economy.&#8221; He has predicted that the new BRICS+ currency will be <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-jim-rickards-predicts-unveiling-of-new-brics-currency-says-the-world-is-unprepared-for-this-geopolitical-shock-wave/">linked to gold</a>.</p>
<p>This was not the first time Kiyosaki has warned about the end of the U.S. dollar. Earlier this month, he similarly stated that the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosakis-warnings-giant-crash-incoming-end-of-us-dollar-approaching/">U.S. dollar&#8217;s demise</a> is imminent, predicting that it will occur with the launch of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-warns-us-dollar-will-die-citing-brics-nations-plan-to-launch-gold-backed-currency/">a gold-backed currency</a> by the BRICS nations.</p>

The FSC’s Korea Financial Intelligence Unit, a government agency with the express mandate of combating financial crimes, convened a meeting to discuss strengthening compliance with virtual asset service providers (VASPs).</p>
<p>The head of the intelligence unit, Lee Yoon-soo, highlighted a burgeoning necessity. He asserted that &#8220;the need to establish market order and protect investors has increased significantly as the virtual asset market has been formed and developed domestically and internationally over the past few years.” The director added:</p>
<blockquote><p>As the role of virtual asset operators is very important as the primary gateway for preventing illegal activities, we plan to support the enhancement of autonomous compliance capabilities of operators by strengthening the legal compliance incentive system and improving predictability for laws and systems.</p></blockquote>

<p>The meeting revealed that Upbit has created an abnormal transaction detection system using artificial intelligence (AI). Bithumb developed a feature to automatically terminate the exchange app when a remote control app is installed and it detects money laundering transactions. Coinone enhanced management and monitoring of &#8216;risk wallet address&#8217; related to financial accidents. Korbit introduced a real-time management system for each stage of Suspicious Transaction Reporting (STR) and a secondary review system.</p>
<p>Lastly, Gopax established a hotline that can immediately respond when an account freeze request related to crimes such as voice phishing is received. By engaging in a collective commitment, the attendees of the meeting pledged to fortify their shared dialogue around growing compliance abilities. They plan to sustain this commitment by convening consistently every 2-3 months going forward.</p>

<h2>Stronghold Digital Mining Acquires 2,000 Avalon A1346 Bitcoin Miners</h2>
<p>Although 2022 wasn&#8217;t an exceptional year for bitcoin mining operations, firms have significantly expanded in 2023. New facilities have been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/mawson-infrastructure-group-expands-to-new-bitcoin-mining-site-in-ohio-plans-to-boost-hashpower-by-1-eh-s/">launched</a>, and mining companies have purchased <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cleanspark-bolsters-hashrate-with-40-5m-purchase-of-12500-bitcoin-miners/">thousands</a> of bitcoin miners for expansion. On Thursday, Stronghold Digital Mining, listed on Nasdaq as SDIG, revealed it has purchased 2,000 <a href="https://www.canaan.io/product/avalon-made-a1346">Avalon A1346 bitcoin miners</a> crafted by Canaan.</p>
<p>The Canaan mining machines are estimated to produce a hashrate of around 110 terahash per second (TH/s), with a single machine consuming 3,300 watts. The power efficiency of a single Avalon A1346 is approximately 30 joules per terahash. Stronghold specified that the new machines, costing the company $3 million, will be delivered to its Panther Creek facility in the third quarter.</p>
<p>“We are very excited to expand our relationship with Canaan through the purchase of the A1346 miners, their most efficient bitcoin miners,” Greg Beard, the chairman and CEO of Stronghold remarked. “These miners are among our best performers in our air-cooled Strongbox containers and provide an attractive value proposition given the combination of high hashrate, energy efficiency, and price point.”</p>

<p>Stronghold&#8217;s purchase follows its <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/stronghold-digital-partners-with-canaan-subsidiary-to-boost-bitcoin-mining-capacity-by-400-ph-s/">announcement</a> of a partnership with Canaan subsidiary Cantaloupe Digital LLC in May. The company entered a two-year hosting agreement at that time, which has since been amended and expanded. Despite a 1.36% drop in Stronghold shares on Thursday, 30-day statistics indicate SDIG shares have increased 136% against the U.S. dollar.</p>

Prosecutors said the charges were dropped in accordance with U.S. treaty obligations to the Bahamas.</strong></p>
<h2>Sam Bankman-Fried Cleared of Campaign Finance Charges</h2>
<p>Campaign finance charges against Sam Bankman-Fried, co-founder and former CEO of FTX, have been dropped, according to a court filing released Wednesday. Bankman-Fried was extradited swiftly from the Bahamas to the U.S. last December. His lawyers argued that the U.S. Department of Justice mishandled the extradition process.</p>
<p>In late June, Bankman-Fried&#8217;s legal team <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/judge-rejects-bankman-frieds-attempt-to-dismiss-criminal-charges-calls-arguments-unpersuasive-and-without-merit/">argued</a> that the extradition process from the Bahamas to the U.S. violated the rule of specialty, as he faced charges beyond those originally specified in the extradition request. “In keeping with its treaty obligations to the Bahamas, the government does not intend to proceed to trial on the campaign contributions count,” states the court filing released Wednesday.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">BREAKING: The Department of ‘Justice’ drops charges against Sam Bankman-Fried. </p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>On Thursday afternoon, social media platforms such as X were filled with posts about the dropped campaign finance charges against Bankman-Fried. At 2:30 p.m. Eastern time, the trending topic &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%22Sam%20Bankman-Fried%22&amp;src=trend_click&amp;vertical=trends">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>&#8221; was being discussed by 51,000 X users. “Sam Bankman-Fried of FTX having a federal campaign contribution charge dropped by the DOJ because it would incriminate too many of their preferred politicians going into the 2024 election is pretty insane,” <a href="https://twitter.com/AutismCapital/status/1684587171318210561?s=20">wrote</a> Autism Capital, an account on X.</p>
<p>“The Department of Justice dropped the campaign finance charge against Sam Bankman-Fried,” the X account Tarabull <a href="https://twitter.com/TaraBull808/status/1684596283695349760?s=20">said</a> on Thursday. “Our two-tier justice system at work. Remember when Sam Bankman-Fried gave $300K to House Committee Members investigating him, including Maxine Waters?” Investigative journalist Glenn Greenwald commented on the charges being dropped as well <a href="https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1684631400358543360?s=20">stating</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Congrats to Sam Bankman-Fried — the Dem Party&#8217;s second-largest donor (behind George Soros) — on having his campaign finance fraud charges dropped by the Biden DOJ. Their hilarious claim is that they just couldn&#8217;t proceed because the big, powerful Bahamas wouldn&#8217;t let them.</p></blockquote>

<p>SBF is set to face trial in October, with three colleagues expected to testify against him. Recently, he was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sam-bankman-fried-accused-of-leaking-diary-excerpts-to-discredit-key-witness/">accused</a> of tampering with witness evidence by allegedly releasing excerpts from the online diary of key witness Caroline Ellison, former CEO of Alameda Research. Prosecutors are <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/prosecutors-want-sam-bankman-fried-jailed-ahead-of-trial/">seeking</a> to reincarcerate Bankman-Fried on the grounds of this alleged witness tampering.</p>

<h2>ECB Boosts Interest Rates Amid Inflation Woes</h2>
<p>The European Central Bank’s (ECB) Governing Council <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2023/html/ecb.mp230727~da80cfcf24.en.html">announced</a> that it has raised three key ECB interest rates by 25bps on Thursday. The ECB’s move follows the U.S. Federal Reserve <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-reserve-raises-federal-funds-rate-by-25bps-amidst-moderate-economic-growth/">hiking</a> the federal funds rate by 25bps the day prior. Similarly to the Fed’s decision, the ECB members of the Governing Council insisted that the bank looks to get annual inflation down to its 2% target. The interest rate hike will be the ECB’s 12th rate hike in a row.</p>
<p>“The rate increase today reflects the Governing Council’s assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission,” the ECB detailed. “The developments since the last meeting support the expectation that inflation will drop further over the remainder of the year but will stay above target for an extended period.”</p>
<p>The ECB hinted at pausing the rate hikes in September but when reporters pressed ECB president Christine Lagarde about when the central banks would cut rates, she insisted it wasn&#8217;t going to happen. “We are not going to cut,” Lagarde <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/27/ecb-rate-decision-july-2023-raises-rates-by-25-basis-points.html">stated</a>. The ECB&#8217;s rate hikes have had an <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/economic-bulletin/focus/2022/html/ecb.ebbox202206_04~786da4a23a.en.html">impact on mortgage rates</a> in the euro area, which have risen significantly since the beginning of 2022 and the ECB’s rate hikes. For instance, the average mortgage interest rate exceeded 9% in Poland in Q4 2022.</p>

<p>The ECB detailed on Thursday that the principal refinancing operations interest rate, along with the rates of the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility, will be elevated to 4.25%, 4.50%, and 3.75% respectively, taking effect from August 2, 2023. Following the ECB’s announcement, the <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/EUR-USD">euro</a> slid against the U.S. dollar by 0.78%. Euro area yield curves also experienced a downward shift.</p>

<h2>Ahead of 15th BRICS Summit, South Africa&#8217;s Pandor Talks Peace and BRICS Expansion</h2>
<p>The forthcoming BRICS Summit, occurring from August 22 to 24, 2023, at the Sandton Convention Centre (SCC) in Johannesburg, South Africa, has generated considerable buzz. It is estimated that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-interest-soars-40-countries-seek-membership-as-de-dollarization-efforts-grow/">over 40 countries</a> have either applied or expressed interest in joining the BRICS nations, comprised of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.</p>
<p>Although discussions surrounding the BRICS are often linked with de-dollarization and competition with Western nations like the United States, the White House <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/white-house-says-us-policy-allows-partners-to-seek-brics-membership/">stated</a> this week that it does not wish to restrict partnerships between countries. In an <a href="https://www.rt.com/africa/580337-brics-fresh-forum-against-weaponization/">exclusive interview</a> with South Africa&#8217;s foreign minister Naledi Pandor, the diplomat underscored that BRICS harbors no intentions of &#8220;weaponizing the oceans,&#8221; clarifying that talks of peace will be held during the 15th BRICS Summit.</p>
<p>Pandor also noted that a platform aimed at resolving the conflict between Ukraine and Russia would be established. “We’re not standing against anyone; we’re not standing for anybody. We work for the good of the world. We’re not seeking to weaponize the oceans, we’re not seeking to weaponize the forest, and we’re not seeking to weaponize climate change,” stated Pandor to RT. She further added that other African leaders intended to strengthen their ties with Russia.</p>

<p>While it has been reported that the upcoming summit will <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-currency-not-on-agenda-for-leaders-summit-nations-to-focus-on-de-dollarization/">focus less attention</a> on creating a BRICS reserve currency, expansion of membership appears likely. Ambassador Anil Sooklal, South Africa&#8217;s envoy to BRICS, <a href="https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2023/05/24/more-than-30-countries-want-to-join-the-brics/">hinted</a> that the group would grow this year. Pandor substantiated these claims in an interview with RT, revealing that three new members will be joining the BRICS bloc, bringing the total to eight participating nations. Though she did not disclose the identities of the new member countries, Pandor praised the expansion as &#8220;fantastic&#8221; news.</p>

The move comes after yesterday’s 7% surge, however earlier gains have since declined, as U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) grew 2.4% as opposed to the 1.8% expectation for Q2. Polygon also climbed higher today, bouncing from a support level around $0.7000.</strong></p>
<h2>Solana (SOL)</h2>
<p>Solana (SOL) moved closer to a long-term resistance level of $26.00 on Thursday, as sentiment in the token remained bullish.</p>
<p>Following a low of $24.45 on Wednesday, SOL/USD surged to an intraday high of $25.59 earlier in today’s session.</p>
<p>As a result of the move, solana climbed to its highest point since last Saturday, when price peaked at $25.97.</p>

<p>One of the reasons behind today’s rally appears to be a breakout which took place at a ceiling of 59.00 on the relative strength index (RSI).</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is now tracking at 59.90, with SOL bulls giving up some of their earlier gains.</p>
<p>Despite climbing by nearly 10% in the past two days, the token is down by 2.80% in the past week, following a recent bear run.</p>

<h2>Polygon (MATIC)</h2>
<p>Polygon (MATIC) bounced from a recent support point earlier in today’s session, as bulls rejected an extended sell-off.</p>
<p>MATIC/USD peaked at $0.7347 on Thursday, a day after falling to a bottom at the $0.7124 mark.</p>
<p>The initial move came as the world’s 11th largest cryptocurrency continued to climb away from floor at $0.7000.</p>

<p>This coincided with the RSI moving away from a support level of its own at 45.00. It is now tracking at 48.24.</p>
<p>Despite this, the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages still look set for a downward cross in the coming days.</p>
<p>Should this occur, the next target for sellers will likely be near the $0.5900 zone.</p>

While requiring the prosecution to formalize the request and giving the defense enough time to make its case, the judge issued a temporary gag order restricting their public comments. </strong></p>
<h2>Prosecutors Seek Sam Bankman-Fried’s Detention Over Witness-Tampering Allegations</h2>
<p>During a hearing on Wednesday, prosecutors in the case against Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), founder and former chief executive of the failed digital asset exchange FTX, asked U.S. District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan to send the crypto entrepreneur to jail.</p>
<p>SBF has been living under house arrest in his parents’ home in Palo Alto, California since December 2022 when he was released on a $250 million bond. His trial on criminal <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftx-founder-bankman-fried-seeks-dismissal-of-charges-filed-after-extradition/">charges</a> linked to the collapse of the crypto trading platform is scheduled to begin in October.</p>
<p>The prosecution is seeking modifications to Bankman-Fried’s bail agreement following the publication of an article in the New York Times about Caroline Ellison, former CEO of the Alameda Research hedge fund, also founded by Bankman-Fried, NPR and CNN reported.</p>
<p>In an interview with the newspaper, SBF showed some of the “private writings” of Ellison, who is also his former girlfriend. This, according to the prosecutors, amounted to witness tampering. Earlier this year, Ellison pleaded guilty to fraud charges and is expected to testify against him.</p>

<p>The Bahamas-headquartered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a>, which was one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/troubled-crypto-exchange-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection-ceo-steps-down/">filed</a> for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. on Nov. 11. About a month later, Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamian capital, Nassau, and extradited to the United States.</p>
<p>U.S. authorities accuse him of fraud and misusing customer funds, including to finance property purchases and increase trading through Alameda. Unlike Ellison and former FTX <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftx-sues-sbf-former-execs-to-recover-over-1-billion/">executives</a>, SBF pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Judge Kaplan said he was accepting the prosecution’s request but wants to see it in writing by Friday. Bankman-Fried’s lead attorney, Mark Cohen, complained the defense was notified about it “one minute before court.” SBF’s lawyers are expected to make their case against it by Aug. 1.</p>
<p>Kaplan imposed a temporary gag order while he considers the government’s request to jail Sam Bankman-Fried who has frequently communicated with the public and the media since his arrest. According to U.S. authorities, he has had over 1,000 phone calls with journalists including 100 calls with the reporter who wrote the New York Times piece.</p>

The Fed increased rates by 25 basis points, and have hinted that they could make an additional move in September. Ethereum neared the $1,900 level today.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) remained in the green on Thursday, as markets reacted to the latest Federal Reserve interest rate decision.</p>
<p>After deciding on a 0.25% hike, Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that &#x201C;It is certainly possible that we would raise funds again at the September meeting if the data warranted.&#x201D;</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD surged to an intraday high of $29,675.55 on Wednesday, following an earlier low of $29,162.46.</p>

<p>The move began after the relative strength index (RSI) bounced from a floor at 42.00. It is now hovering around a ceiling at 47.00.</p>
<p>The exact reading is at 46.65, which has prompted some earlier bulls to abandon previous positions, and secure profits instead.</p>
<p>Traders are likely waiting for the upcoming gross domestic product (GDP) data out later today, before making the next move.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) also edged higher on Thursday, as bulls pushed the cryptocurrency towards the $1,900 level.</p>
<p>Following a low of $1,849.98 on Wednesday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD moved to peak at $1,886.97 earlier in today&#x2019;s session</p>
<p>This is the highest point ethereum has traded at since Monday, when price traded marginally above $1,890.</p>

<p>Today&#x2019;s rally came as the world&#x2019;s second largest cryptocurrency broke out of a ceiling on the RSI at 48.00.</p>
<p>Despite this, the recent crossover of 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages, means sentiment is predominantly bearish.</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is tracking at 48.95, with price at $1,876.43.</p>
