Shiba Inu (SHIB) experienced a decline in social dominance over the past week, indicating a decrease in popularity for the meme coin. Despite being oversold based on its Relative Strength Index (RSI), other indicators were bearish, suggesting a potential further decline in price.¬† However, SHIB has a history of responding rapidly to updates within its ecosystem, and a forthcoming Shibarium update could potentially reverse the downward trend. With the release of the Shibarium update, there may be a potential opportunity for the coin to regain its footing and improve its market performance.
