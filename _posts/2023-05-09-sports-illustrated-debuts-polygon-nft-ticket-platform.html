<p>Sports Illustrated&rsquo;s ticketing affiliate, SI Tickets, launched its new &ldquo;Box Office&rdquo; platform, a self-service ticketing service based on the Polygon blockchain. </p>
<p>Sports Illustrated Tickets (SI Tickets) announced the launch of Box Office, a new non-fungible token (NFT) ticketing platform built on the Polygon blockchain, an Ethereum scaling solution.

<p>According to the announcement:</p>

<p>Box Office is the first global platform to combine a complete NFT ticket solution for events of any size with visibility and adjacency to traditional, non-NFT tickets alongside the biggest in sports, concert and theatre on the SI Tickets marketplace.</p>

<p>Box Office delivers a seamless &ldquo;experience giving owners, organisers and host the ability to create, manage and promote a fully scalable, paid, or free ticketed live sporting event, performance or function fuelled by the Sports Illustrated Tickets platform.&rdquo;</p>
<p>SI Tickets CEO, David Lane, said this new marketplace aims to &ldquo;disrupt the primary ticket market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lane added:</p>

<p>Blockchain is the future of ticketing, and now owners, promoters, hosts and attendees have access to an advanced ticketing experience that transforms the antiquated barcode into engaging and collectable content.</p>

<p>Box Office caters to the biggest events in sports and music but welcomes ticket listings from smaller ticket issuers that typically appear on ticketing sites like Eventbrite or DICE. Lane commented on this, saying:</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re not here to compete against Ticketmaster, SeatGeek, or AXS. We&rsquo;re going after the self-service event market. We&rsquo;re trying to create the first mass-market adoption of NFT ticketing so that everyone from a 15-year-old to a 90-year-old can buy their first NFT ticket without having to go through a crypto tutorial on blockchain, or have to get a wallet and understand any aspects of it.</p>

<p>Box Office NFT tickets will confer a host of benefits to its holder. In addition to granting entry, event organisers can equip tickets with photo and video content, collectables, personalised messages, promotional offers and loyalty rewards. Tickets can be found inside the SI Tickets app.</p>
