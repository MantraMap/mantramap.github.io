					<description><![CDATA[Cardano has leaped considerably in the realm of DeFi activities, particularly in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL), despite the somewhat lackluster performance of ADA itself.  TVL refers to the total value of assets locked within various decentralized finance protocols and applications on the Cardano blockchain. An increasing TVL can have several positive implications for the Cardano ecosystem. The significance of TVL lies in its reflection of the overall engagement and adoption of DeFi projects built on Cardano. A higher TVL indicates greater trust and confidence in these decentralized financial services. It demonstrates that users are willing to lock their assets within the ecosystem, utilizing various DeFi protocols for lending, borrowing, staking, and other financial activities. Cardano TVL Surges Amid Price Decline ADA has experienced a recent decline in its price, with the latest data from Coingecko showing it currently stands at $0.305. Over the past 24 hours, the price has faced a modest 0.4% decline, and over the last seven days, it has decreased by a mere 0.3%. Despite these losses, there is a notable silver lining in the form of Cardano&#8217;s TVL on the network. Source: Coingecko The surge in Cardano&#8217;s TVL by 28% in the last three months indicates a growing interest in the DeFi activities offered by the network. It reflects growing confidence among users willing to lock their assets in decentralized applications, such as lending platforms, decentralized exchanges, and liquidity pools.

					<description><![CDATA[As the year 2023 continues to unfold, Bitcoin&#8217;s retreat below the pivotal $30,000 mark raises questions about the overall strength and stability of the cryptocurrency market. Once, the crypto market held a significant lead over traditional stocks, according to Bloomberg. However, this advantage seems to be dwindling as Bitcoin &#8211; a leading market indicator &#8211; exhibits signs of struggle. The year-to-date rise of the top 100 digital tokens now stands at 46%, narrowing the gap with the 41% increase of the tech-driven Nasdaq 100 Index. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Realized Cap Nears $400 Billion Despite Price Struggle At $30,000 Technology stocks, particularly those influenced by artificial intelligence hype, have been rapidly gaining ground. This surge resulted in the Nasdaq 100 Index briefly surpassing the MVIS CryptoCompare Digital Assets 100 Index in June. Impact of Regulatory Changes And Fed Decisions Previously, the crypto market received a positive push from both regulatory efforts on digital assets that face a stumbling block in US court on digital assets and the hope that spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) would be authorized in the US.  However, these boosting factors have waned. Investors are now cautiously considering how the anticipated interest-rate hike by the Federal Reserve could impact both traditional and digital markets. According to Caroline Mauron, co-founder of digital-asset derivatives liquidity provider OrBit Markets, the rally has lost momentum since the initial excitement sparked by the ETF news. &#8220;There are no other visible catalysts on the horizon,&#8221; she noted. She also hinted at a potential silver lining, pointing out that the &#8220;downside risk should be limited as the Fed is near the end of the current rate hiking cycle, which should support risk assets including crypto.&#8221; Bitcoin Chart Patterns Signal Warning Signs Further cause for concern is seen in the various chart patterns that track Bitcoin&#8217;s performance. A key indicator, Bitcoin’s 20-week Bollinger bandwidth, has contracted to its narrowest in seven years. This tightening suggests that moves in the value of Bitcoin could intensify, according to Bloomberg. If crucial thresholds aren&#8217;t maintained, it&#8217;s likely we could see a downward trend. The Bollinger study also provides an invaluable method for analyzing the volatility of this digital asset. Market analyst at IG Australia Pty, Tony Sycamore, noted the potential for Bitcoin&#8217;s drop to continue, &#8220;Bitcoin should extend toward $26,000/$25,000 before finding support,&#8221; he predicted.

This price action has resulted in more than 45,000 traders caught in the crypto market total liquidation of over $130 million in the past day. Furthermore, Bitcoin currently has a 24-hour high of $29,762 and a 24-hour low of $29,983, at the time of writing. The asset’s market cap has plunged from a high of $583 billion seen last Tuesday to $567 billion, as of today.

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin whales are witnessing a historic exodus. @CryptoVizArt, a senior researcher at Glassnode has shed light on the significant shifts within the whale cohort in a new analysis. Bitcoin Whales&#8217; Impact: Unveiling The Numbers In a remarkable revelation, the research highlights the substantial impact of whales on recent market activity. According to the data, &#8220;34% of sell pressure in the last 30 day was from Binance whales.&#8221; These influential entities have been instrumental in shaping the recent market dynamics. Moreover, the research also highlights a trend in whale behavior: a noteworthy decline in the total balance of whale entities on exchanges. In the last 30 days, the report states, &#8220;Whale Flow to Exchanges witnessed the largest monthly balance decline in history, hitting -148,000 BTC/month.&#8221; This dramatic decline marks a significant shift within the whale cohort, raising intriguing questions about their motives and strategies. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Hits Next Bearish Target But Bears Are Not Done Yet As the market witnessed the rally above $31,000, the influx of whale funds to exchanges surged remarkably. Glassnode’s data reveals that whale inflow volumes reached an impressive +16,300 BTC/day, signifying their active involvement in recent market movements. Notably, this whale dominance accounted for 41% of all exchange inflows, which is comparable to both the LUNA crash (39%) and the failure of FTX (33%). Throughout June and July, whale inflows have sustained an elevated inflow bias of between 4,000 to 6,500 BTC/day. Among all exchanges, Binance emerged as the primary destination for whale inflows. The report discloses that around 82% of whale-to-exchange flows were heading into Binance. In contrast, Coinbase accounted for 6.8%, and all other exchanges account for 11.2%. While the overall balance of whales may have declined, @CryptoVizArt&#8217;s analysis points to intriguing internal dynamics within the whale cohort. As some whales increased their balances, others experienced declines. This phenomenon led the researcher to introduce the concept of &#8216;Whale Reshuffling,&#8217; suggesting that not all whales follow the same strategy. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exodus: Exchange Balances Plummet To Lowest Levels Since 2018 The examination of the whale cohort over the last 30 days shows that whales with more than 100,000 BTC have recorded an increase of +6,000 BTC, whales with 10k-100k BTC have decreased their account balance by -49.0k BTC and whales with 1k-10k BTC have increased their account balance by +33.8k BTC. However, in aggregate, the whale group has seen just -8.7k BTC in net outflows. Remarkably, whale entities now account for only 46% of the total supply, down from 63% at the beginning of 2021. Since the early days of Bitcoin, a steady downward trend can be observed. Short-Term Holders: The Driving Force The research also sheds light on the dominance of short-term holders (STHs) among the whale entities. The data indicates that STHs represent a significant portion of recent trading activity, actively trading the market. This behavior is evident as market rallies and corrections lead to notable upticks in profit or loss among this group. Short-Term Holder (STH) Dominance across Exchange Inflows has exploded to 82%. This is drastically above the long-term range over the last five years (typically 55% to 65%). “From this, we can establish a case that much of the recent trading activity is driven by Whales active within the 2023 market and thus classified as STHs”, states the analyst, adding, &#8220;each rally and correction since the FTX fallout has seen a 10k+ BTC uptick in STH profit or loss, respectively.&#8221; BTC whale transactions can therefore currently be a good indicator. However, special attention also needs to be paid to the STHs, which will eventually run out of bullets at some point. At press time, the BTC price stood at $29,203.

<p>Remarkably, whale entities now account for only 46% of the total supply, down from 63% at the beginning of 2021. Since the early days of Bitcoin, a steady downward trend can be observed.</p>

<h2>Short-Term Holders: The Driving Force</h2>
<p>The research also sheds light on the dominance of short-term holders (STHs) among the whale entities. The data indicates that STHs represent a significant portion of recent trading activity, actively trading the market. This behavior is evident as market rallies and corrections lead to notable upticks in profit or loss among this group.</p>
<p>Short-Term Holder (STH) Dominance across Exchange Inflows has exploded to 82%. This is drastically above the long-term range over the last five years (typically 55% to 65%). “From this, we can establish a case that much of the recent trading activity is driven by Whales active within the 2023 market and thus classified as STHs”, states the analyst, adding, &#8220;each rally and correction since the FTX fallout has seen a 10k+ BTC uptick in STH profit or loss, respectively.&#8221;</p>
<p>BTC whale transactions can therefore currently be a good indicator. However, special attention also needs to be paid to the STHs, which will eventually run out of bullets at some point.</p>
<p>At press time, the BTC price stood at $29,203.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin (BTC) continues to dominate the cryptocurrency market, as exchange balances have dropped to levels last seen in early 2018. This signals a growing trend of investors moving their Bitcoin holdings to cold storage, which is considered to be more secure.  According to a recent report by Bitfinex, while some of this decline in exchange balances may be attributed to the usage of decentralized exchanges and funds not covered in the data, the overarching trend appears to be a widespread movement of people withdrawing their Bitcoin from exchanges. Bitcoin-Backed Funds Lead Crypto Investment Surge  This trend is also reflected in the recent data from CoinShares, which shows that traditional fund investors are demonstrating a renewed interest in Bitcoin.  Crypto-backed investment funds saw a net inflow of $137 million last week, with a staggering 99 percent of this sum directed toward Bitcoin-backed funds.  Related Reading: Elon Musk Incorporates Dogecoin Symbol In Twitter Bio, Triggering 5% Increase In Price According to Bitfinex, this marks the fourth consecutive week of gross inflows into crypto funds, amassing a total of $742 million over the period, representing the largest run of inflows since the final quarter of 2021. The sustained inflows into Bitcoin-backed funds indicate strong investor confidence in the asset, despite the volatility inherent in the crypto market. Additionally, the outflows from short-Bitcoin funds reinforce the bullish sentiment for the BTC price among investors, which has now been in a tight range for months.  This data can thus be used as a proxy for institutional investor bias that the price will break out of this range toward the upside. Meanwhile, Ethereum funds were the only other category to see outflows last week, losing $1.6 million on a net basis. Altcoin funds, on the other hand, recorded slight inflows, with the largest going to multi-asset funds, followed by funds backed by Solana&#8217;s SOL token and Polygon&#8217;s MATIC.  Overall, this data paints a clear picture of Bitcoin&#8217;s continued dominance in the crypto market. While altcoins are making their presence felt, Bitcoin remains the preferred asset for traditional fund investors.  The sustained inflows into Bitcoin-backed funds suggest that investors have confidence in the asset&#8217;s long-term growth potential, despite the short-term volatility in the crypto market.  BTC Whales Increased Activity Indicates Bullish Market Sentiment According to a report by Glassnode, whales, or entities holding 1,000 or more BTC, have been making significant moves in the cryptocurrency market, with whale inflows to exchanges being historically large and accounting for 41% of the total. The dominance of whale inflow volumes to exchanges is significant, with over 82% of whale inflows destined for Binance, the largest exchange in the industry. This trend highlights the importance of the role played by whales in the cryptocurrency market, as their activity can have a significant impact on the price and overall sentiment of Bitcoin. While the report notes that many of these active whale entities are classified as short-term holders, with notable activity around local market peaks and troughs, it also highlights the long-term behavior of whales.  Related Reading: Russian Introduces A Third Form Of Currency As Putin Signs Digital Ruble Into Law Glassnode&#8217;s Trend Accumulation Score by Cohort shows that the smallest entities with less than 100 BTC have slowed down their spending over the last month.  On the other hand, the whale subdivisions with more than 1,000 BTC demonstrated divergent behavior, with those holding more than 10,000 BTC distributing and those holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC accumulating at a significantly higher rate. This behavior suggests that whales are actively reshuffling their holdings, moving funds internally between entities. While this can have short-term implications for the market, it also highlights the long-term potential for Bitcoin to remain a valuable asset for investors.

					<description><![CDATA[Fidelity, a leading financial services provider, has recently released a report on Ethereum (ETH) that sheds light on some key metrics to watch for the cryptocurrency in the coming months.  The report highlights several important indicators, including the 50-day and 200-day moving averages (MA), the realized price, the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) ratio, Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Z-Score, percent in profit, and the Pi Cycle indicators, all of which can provide valuable insights into market sentiment and potential price movements. Ethereum Holds Strong Above Key Support Levels Per the report, Ethereum has remained above key support levels, with the realized price serving as a strong support level since January 10th.  Additionally, the NUPL ratio suggests that Ethereum is currently in a neutral zone, while the MVRV Z-Score indicates that the cryptocurrency&#8217;s market value is estimated to be just over the &#8220;fair&#8221; zone, potentially setting the stage for a bull run or at least sideways price action, according to Fidelity.  Another interesting metric highlighted in the report is the percent of unique addresses in profit, which currently sits at nearly 66%. While this metric has not touched the green zone since January 2020, it suggests that Ethereum owners may be using the cryptocurrency for trading, DeFi, staking, or buying other digital assets. Related Reading: Bittrex To US Users: Withdraw Your Crypto Or Risk Running Into Issues Furthermore, the Pi Cycle indicators, which have historically been a good cycle top indicator, are showing that Ethereum is currently in a neutral zone. As the long-term moving average continues to follow the sunken price downward, it may be setting the stage for more volatility shortly. However, whether this volatility will be to the upside or downside remains to be seen and could depend on a variety of macro factors. ETH Adoption On The Rise On the other hand, Fidelity’s report highlights that while monthly active addresses and the monthly transaction count have fallen by 1%, the number of monthly new Ethereum addresses has slowly increased by 9% in Q2 2023. New addresses are defined as unique addresses that appeared for the first time in a transaction. This metric for momentum may not show direct network usage, but it does indicate a clearer picture of Ethereum adoption. The short-term moving average of new addresses is shown to be rising back above that of the longer-term moving average, indicating that the rate of new users joining the network is increasing. New and existing projects are likely incentivizing new users and helping to drive this increase. Another significant metric highlighted in the report is the net issuance of new supply issued by the network minus burned supply from transactions since The Merge.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Plunge To $29,200 Sends 5.9% Of Supply Into Loss This has driven a supply decrease for over five months now, with net issuance surpassing -700,000 Ether. The report notes that this is important because, in theory, as Ethereum&#8217;s supply is destroyed, it raises the relative ownership level of all remaining token holders. As of writing, ETH’s price is at $1,849, which has decreased by 2% within the last 24 hours. Similar to Bitcoin&#8217;s situation, Ethereum has also lost its 50-day MA, which is currently positioned at $1,869. If the market continues to decline, ETH can anticipate several key support levels that may help prevent a further bearish trend. The closest support level is situated at $1,840, followed by another support level of $1,792. However, the most crucial support floor is the 200-day MA, which is located at $1,780. This will be a significant factor in determining who will dominate in the upcoming months. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fidelity, a leading financial services provider, has recently released a <a href="https://www.fidelitydigitalassets.com/sites/default/files/documents/1096171.1.0%20Fidelity%20Digital%20Assets%20-%20Q2%20Signals%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">report </a>on Ethereum (ETH) that sheds light on some key metrics to watch for the cryptocurrency in the coming months. </p>
<p>The report highlights several important indicators, including the 50-day and 200-day moving averages (MA), the realized price, the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) ratio, Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Z-Score, percent in profit, and the Pi Cycle indicators, all of which can provide valuable insights into market sentiment and potential price movements.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Holds Strong Above Key Support Levels</h2>
<p>Per the report, Ethereum has remained above key support levels, with the realized price serving as a strong support level since January 10th. </p>
<p>Additionally, the NUPL ratio suggests that Ethereum is currently in a neutral zone, while the MVRV Z-Score indicates that the cryptocurrency&#8217;s market value is estimated to be just over the &#8220;fair&#8221; zone, potentially setting the stage for a bull run or at least sideways price action, according to Fidelity. </p>

<p>Another interesting metric highlighted in the report is the percent of unique addresses in profit, which currently sits at nearly 66%. While this metric has not touched the green zone since January 2020, it suggests that Ethereum owners may be using the cryptocurrency for trading, DeFi, staking, or buying other digital assets.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Pi Cycle indicators, which have historically been a good cycle top indicator, are showing that Ethereum is currently in a neutral zone. As the long-term moving average continues to follow the sunken price downward, it may be setting the stage for more volatility shortly. </p>
<p>However, whether this volatility will be to the upside or downside remains to be seen and could depend on a variety of macro factors.</p>
ETH Adoption On The Rise
<p>On the other hand, Fidelity’s report highlights that while monthly active addresses and the monthly transaction count have fallen by 1%, the number of monthly new Ethereum addresses has slowly increased by 9% in Q2 2023.</p>
<p>New addresses are defined as unique addresses that appeared for the first time in a transaction. This metric for momentum may not show direct network usage, but it does indicate a clearer picture of Ethereum adoption.</p>
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-544187" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot_30.jpg" alt="Ethereum " width="606" height="307" srcset="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot_30.jpg 606w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot_30-460x233.jpg 460w" sizes="(max-width: 606px) 100vw, 606px"/>
<p>The short-term moving average of new addresses is shown to be rising back above that of the longer-term moving average, indicating that the rate of new users joining the network is increasing. New and existing projects are likely incentivizing new users and helping to drive this increase.</p>
<p>Another significant metric highlighted in the report is the net issuance of new supply issued by the network minus burned supply from transactions since The Merge. </p>

<p>This has driven a supply decrease for over five months now, with net issuance surpassing -700,000 Ether. The report notes that this is important because, in theory, as Ethereum&#8217;s supply is destroyed, it raises the relative ownership level of all remaining token holders.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[On July 24, 2023, Coinglass data revealed that over $41 million worth of Bitcoin long and short leveraged positions were liquidated as the BTC prices unexpectedly crashed below a consolidation level of around $29,500, shrinking by over 4%. The drop below the primary support is heaping pressure on the coin. It may draw more selling pressure in upcoming sessions, pushing prices toward immediate reaction lines, the next being at about $28,300.  Bitcoin Drops, Over $41 Million Of Longs Liquidated In crypto trading, liquidation happens the facilitating exchange, for example, OKX or Binance, forcibly takes over the collateral securing the leverage position whenever prices move against the trader&#8217;s prognosis. In this case, the recent liquidation was triggered by the rapid sell-off in Bitcoin, leading to a more than 4% price decline within a few hours during the New York Session on July 24. Binance, the world&#8217;s largest crypto exchange and a platform facilitating trading crypto derivatives, liquidated most levered positions. Significant liquidation amounts were also observed in ByBit and OKX. Related Reading: Binance Announces Listing Of Sam Altman’s Worldcoin, Opens Deposits A big chunk of liquidated positions were &#8220;longs,&#8221; meaning traders expected prices to rise in the days ahead. Coinglass said over $41 million of cumulative long positions were closed. Meanwhile, only $2.5 million of short positions were closed despite Bitcoin plunging, moving along the traders&#8217; price prediction. Despite Bitcoin remaining in a bullish formation, prices have been moving inside a consolidation, failing to breach the $31,800 level recorded in mid-July 2023. Coinciding with this expansion, a United States judge had ruled to favor Ripple Labs, saying XRP was not a security, in their case against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Following this declaration, the broader crypto market edged higher, only to cool off days later. Bitcoin has been no exception, as current price action reveals. Will ETF Applications Support Prices? Still, the collapse comes a few days after the SEC accepted applications from major financial institutions, including BlackRock, a prominent Wall Street giant, to launch Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). News of BlackRock applying for a Bitcoin ETF previously triggered a bull run, pumping prices to 2023 highs.  Bitcoin remains bullish as prices remain within the leg-up established from June 15 to July 13. Even though fundamental factors could support prices, BTC may edge lower should bulls fail to prop up prices and push them within the consolidation of the better half of July 2023.  Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Transfers To Exchanges Suggest More Selling Pressure For ETH Technically, a close above $31,800 and July 13 highs may drive the coin towards the $36,000 zone and later $43,000 in a buy trend continuation formation.
