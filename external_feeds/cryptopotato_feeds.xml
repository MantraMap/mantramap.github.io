			            <description><![CDATA[Senator Lummis and Congressman McHenry break down their latest progress on pushing digital asset legislation forward in both chambers of Congress.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Crypto-supportive Republican policymakers Patrick McHenry and Cynthia Lummis provided the latest updates on digital asset legislation at Consensus 2023 – and they’re highly optimistic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The former believes President Biden will have signed the first bill into law directly forming rules around cryptocurrency within the next 12 months. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">Progress on the Lummis Bill</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">During their panel discussion on Friday, Lummis began by clarifying that the next installment of her digital asset regulation bill, the Responsible Financial Innovation Act, will be presented before the Senate within the next 6 to 8 weeks</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The legislation – co-authored alongside fellow Senator Kirsten Gillibrand – is designed to bring regulatory clarity across many areas of the digital asset industry, including the classification of cryptocurrencies as either securities or commodities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike its first draft published in June, however, this bill will include strengthened sections pertaining to protecting national security and tackling cybercrime.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We want to preserve the important part of the framework that makes sure we’re having a well-understood regulatory framework for both the innovators and the regulators,” said Lummis.</span></p></blockquote>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">The House’s Plans for Crypto</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pertaining to the House, McHenry – who serves as the chairman of the House Financial Service Committee (HFSC) – confirmed that the HFSC and Agricultural Committee will hold the first joint hearing on the market structure surrounding digital assets this May. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Over the next two months, the group plans to produce a bill that creates a framework for digital assets to evolve from securities into commodities, and which creates room for some assets not to fit neatly into those categories. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When asked if any digital asset legislation would be signed by the President within the next 12 months, McHenry agreed. “I am gonna be able to produce a bill out of the House – I am confident of that,” he followed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lummis believes the House will likely move first in getting legislation through before the Senate, due to the inability of the bill to pass on a partisan basis in her chamber. “This is a bipartisan subject that needs to be addressed before the 2024 election,” she added. </span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Stacks CEO Muneeb Ali discussed Bitcoin's application potential at Consensus 2023.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Stacks CEO Muneeb Ali spoke at Consensus 2023 on Friday about Bitcoin’s potential as a settlement layer, and the revival of developer culture within the community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ali noted how a small, specific change to Bitcoin’s base layer could unlock a vast array of applications that can be built via layer 2 technology. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">According to the developer, Bitcoin requires “very little modification” at its base layer to enable true “ZK rollups” – a layer two scaling solution for batching transactions that is commonly used on Ethereum. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“They’re just two OP codes,” said Ali, “like either OP STARK verify, or OP SNARK verify – and that can be done.”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ali doesn’t expect the change to happen for roughly another four to five years, however, given the slow pace at which Bitcoin’s base layer tends to evolve. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Even without those changes, Ali is confident that more development can take place on Bitcoin for it to catch up to more developer-friendly chains. His company Stacks – a self-described Bitcoin layer “1.5” – has developed a protocol called </span><a href="https://www.stacks.co/learn/sbtc" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">sBTC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to bridge BTC from layer 1 to layer 2 chains in a relatively decentralized manner. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">
<blockquote><p>“That sort of technology is what’s needed to really kickstart Bitcoin DeFi,” he said. “We need to make Bitcoin programmable in L2s, and then put that BTC in smart contracts, put them in the hands of developers, and then let them go wild.”</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Stacks’ STX token <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/heres-why-stacks-stx-exploded-160-in-a-week/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span>surged</span></a><span> as Bitcoin Ordinals NFTs popularized in February. Stacks itself supports NFTs on its own chain, though Ordinals is a base layer technology. </span></li>
</ul>

<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Snowden called out OpenAI’s “cruel joke” in branding itself with the name that it chose, given that it won’t provide open access to its training data.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">He said that Stable Diffusion is guilty of similar activity, deliberately crippling its training set from version 1.5 to 2.0 because of moral panics and various accusations. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The liability is distinct between the people who create the model and the people who use the model, which we know in America already works, because you see it with guns,” argued Snowden. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Legislatively, Snowden believes AI is very difficult to handle. Corporations and governments are increasingly observing the public, making people more “legible” and “malleable.” These entities have distinct advantages in the AI field thanks to the vast data centers they have access to about citizen behavior.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“People are gonna be [waving] the red flag about a kind of software communism, where we need to declare the models must be open,” he said.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">On a brighter note, Snowden believes many of AI’s errors can be fixed. In his view, the primary mistake AI developers are making is trying to teach their machines to learn like us. Rather, he believes AI should be “better than us.”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’re not born human, we become human… and they can become better than human, but we have to teach them,” he concluded.</span></p></blockquote>

			            <description><![CDATA[Coinbase executives believe that the SEC’s notice is unnecessary as the U.S. is yet to produce a clear framework for digital assets.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brian Armstrong, the chief executive officer of American crypto exchange Coinbase, and the company’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, have responded to a Wells Notice issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) weeks ago in preparation for enforcement action.</p>
<p>In a recent YouTube <a href="https://youtu.be/zq2jf4sBdYE" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">video</a>, the Coinbase executives insisted that the SEC’s notice was unnecessary. The U.S. government has yet to develop clear rules for the crypto industry, and the exchange’s commitment to regulatory compliance has not wavered.</p>
<h2>Coinbase Reacts to Wells Notice via Vide</h2>
<p>Recall that the SEC <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sec-issues-wells-notice-against-coinbase-for-listing-unregistered-securities/" data-wpel-link="internal">issued</a> a notice against Coinbase on March 22 after a series of investigations, claiming that the platform offered unregistered securities. While announcing the development on Twitter that same day, Armstrong and Grewal expressed their disappointment at the agency for choosing a legal battle over constructive dialogue, which the exchange had been gunning for in previous years.</p>
<p>As of then, the executives said Coinbase was compliant with securities laws in its asset listings and staking services. They have <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/crypto-is-going-offshore-unless-the-us-changes-regulatory-stance-coinbase-ceo/" data-wpel-link="internal">maintained</a> the same stance and reiterated their views yesterday in the video.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are committed to working within the regulatory perimeter, and we want to see a clear market structure for trading crypto securities. Not all crypto assets are securities. There are also crypto commodities, there are stablecoins, there’s crypto that’s artwork. We’re going to work with multiple regulators to make this industry safe and trusted,” Armstrong said.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Coinbase Doubles Down on Crypto Framework Request</h2>
<p>Furthermore, the CEO argued that issuing a Wells Notice at this stage, when America does not have a clear rule book for the crypto industry, is unconstructive and bad. He added that while Coinbase is <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-compels-sec-to-respond-to-rulemaking-petition-in-new-lawsuit/" data-wpel-link="internal">prepared</a> to defend its position in court, it did not have to come to that, as the exchange is ready for “true dialogue” with regulators about a path forward for the industry.</p>
<p>Almost the same time the video was posted, Grewal was seated on stage talking to an audience in Austin, Texas, at Consensus 2023, a crypto event hosted by CoinDesk. The legal officer reiterated his thoughts on the matter.</p>
<p>Alongside Armstrong, Grewal insisted that Coinbase did not list securities due to its robust process based on the SEC’s guidance. He disclosed that the exchange rejects about 90% of the assets reviewed for listing.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Balaji gives various likelihoods for the timeframe in which a calamitous event may wreak havoc on the US banking system. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With Bitcoin currently trading at $29,150, the asset will need to appreciate by over 3000% for Balaji Srinivasan – former CTO of Coinbase – to win his $1 million Bitcoin bet by June 17. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The investor and entrepreneur spoke at Consensus 2023 about his motivations and rationale behind the bet, and the likelihood that he may actually be right.</span></p>
<h2>Is $1 Million Bitcoin Still in Play?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before the Consensus Mainstage via video on Friday, Balaji reminded the audience that the great financial crisis took the world by storm in September 2008. This was just five months after the central bank chairman of the time – Ben Bernanke – </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-has-failed-as-an-alternative-money-says-former-fed-chairman/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">predicted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> the world may be in for a “mild recession.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Balaji connected that to how Federal Reserve chairman <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/mild-recession-now-likely-year-federal-reserve-says-rcna79405" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Jerome Powell</a> predicted in April 2023 that the world may be in for a “mild recession” following a string of major bank failures in the previous month. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t know how many months – years – we have,” said Balaji. “If you think like a trader, you think that too early is the same as being wrong. If you think like a prepper, hell is truth seen too late.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the time of his bet, Balaji rested his </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/crypto-twitter-betting-on-hyperinflation-catapulting-btc-to-1-million-in-3-months/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">bullish thesis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> on the US dollar entering a hyperinflationary death spiral in response to the banking crisis. While he still doesn’t have an exact timeframe for when such a collapse will occur, he believes it&#8217;s “better to be early” when trying to bind the downside.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just to quantify it, I think we have a 10% chance of a very serious issue in months, 70% in years, 19% in decades, and 1% it takes a century or so on,” he added. </span></p></blockquote>

<h2>Fed Lied; Banks Died</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the executive, his bet was more of a marketing spend to “raise awareness of the fiat crisis,”  and is really just a “directional signal.” He said it&#8217;s possible that the financial fallout takes place in “900 days” or even “90 months,”  or that Bitcoin’s exact end point falls short of $1 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If his prediction comes true, however, he is sure that he won’t be the one to have caused the collapse through a series of tweets. The Fed, he says, is behind the collapse for having incentivized financial institutions to invest in real estate through easy liquidity in 2021, before tightening interest rates and crashing treasuries and mortgage-backed securities in 2022. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Trust the Fed, end up dead,” he said. “Fed lied, banks died.”</span></p></blockquote>

			            <description><![CDATA[This week saw the cryptocurrency market go on a massive rollercoaster. In the end, BTC stabilized around $29K and the market is more or less where it was seven days ago. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What a week it has been. The cryptocurrency market went on a massive rollercoaster where the market cap ping-ponged tremendously. At the end, it turned out somewhat fine, but what a ride it was. Let&#8217;s unpack.</p>
<p>First things first, Bitcoin&#8217;s price was trading quietly around $27,500 throughout the beginning of the week, but all that changed on April 26th when it soared toward $28,500. After spending a few hours there, it was up only once again. BTC touched $30K and sent the entire community in disbelief.</p>
<p>The bears got wrecked, and talks of &#8220;we&#8217;re so back&#8221; skyrocketed. Unfortunately, it was all short-lived. During the evening of April 26th &#8211; the same day the price pumped, it lost close to $3K of its value in a matter of a single hour. This also had the entire market plummet with it.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it resulted in hundreds of millions worth of liquidated long and short positions. However, that dip was also bought up, and the price is now trading above $29K once again.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the US financial system continues to struggle in certain aspects. This time, the tension manifested within First Republic Bank. Its problems started earlier in the year and ultimately culminated with other big banks injecting a whopping $30 billion.</p>
<p>In any case, it remains particularly interesting to see how the market will turn out and whether or not this turmoil will go on.</p>
<h2>Market Data</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">Market Cap: $1,248B | 24H Vol: $53B | BTC Dominance: 45.3%</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">BTC: $29,199 (+3.4%) | ETH: $1,888 (-2.8%) | BNB: $322 (+1.4%)</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Recall that the US authorities </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/signature-bank-gets-shutdown-by-regulators-following-svb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">shut down</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Silvergate Capital, Signature Bank, and Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in March after they disclosed severe liquidity difficulties. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The concern of a potential contagion in the sector intensified recently after First Republic Bank (one of the top 20 largest financial institutions in the US with over $200 billion of assets under management) saw its shares <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/deepening-crisis-at-first-republic-prompts-urgent-rescue-talks-what-does-it-mean-for-bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">crashing</a> to record lows. The 55% drop (on a weekly basis) occurred shortly after the entity revealed its disappointing Q1 earnings report.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bernstein&#8217;s analysts also expect the Federal Reserve to launch another money-printing campaign in an attempt to solve the banking problems. They urged investors to purchase bitcoin as this could re-establish the asset&#8217;s legacy as digital gold.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;To rescue the ship, the Fed will have to resort to dollar debasement and monetary printing again, bringing back the role of Bitcoin as digital gold.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">BTC&#8217;s Rise Amid the Turbulence</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite the initial shocking moments, the price of the primary cryptocurrency has indeed spiked substantially during the recent banking calamity. It soared to $28,500 a few days after the collapse of SVB and continued its increase in the following month. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The asset seems inclined to perform well on occasions when traditional finance experience significant issues. After all, it was created during the last massive monetary crisis (in 2008) caused by banks, many of which failed and had to be revived again.</span></p>
