This decision was part of a broader action that involved transferring 16 other struggling digital assets, including JasmyCoin (JASMY), OMG Network (OMG), WazirX (WRX), Serum (SRM), OAX (OAX), and more.<br /><br />Binance <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1656231470959063041?s=20">CEO Changpeng</a> &#8220;CZ&#8221; Zhao explained that rather than directly delisting these tokens, the exchange opted to move them to the innovation zone based on a suggestion from a community member. CZ emphasized that this relocation serves as a prelude, allowing the failing projects to improve. However, CZ made it clear that if these projects fail to demonstrate progress, delisting remains a possibility.<br /><br />The innovation zone on Binance was specifically designed to provide users with a platform to trade innovative projects characterized by higher volatility and risks compared to other tokens. Binance will periodically review and assess projects that meet these criteria, monitoring their development closely. If deemed appropriate, these projects could be migrated to Binance&#8217;s main platform.<br /><br />Both Voyager (VGX) and FTX (FTT) have experienced a significant decline in interest since filing for bankruptcy in 2022. VGX, for instance, has dropped from over $1 to approximately $0.15911 at the time of writing, representing an 83% decline over the past year. Its market capitalization has also plummeted to around $40 million from a peak of over $300 million, with a daily trading volume below $10 million.<br /><br />Similarly, FTX&#8217;s FTT has witnessed a rapid decline from its previous heights. The token, associated with the bankrupt exchange, has fallen by over 96% to $1.18594 after reaching an all-time high of over $84 in 2021. Currently, its market capitalization stands at $390.05 million, with a trading volume of $11 million.<br /><br />As the situation unfolds, Binance&#8217;s move to the innovation zone provides a new opportunity for these struggling tokens to potentially turn their fortunes around.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/tether-predicts-700-million-q1-profit-cto-reveals/">Tether</a>, the dominant player in the stablecoin market, recently <a href="https://tether.to/en/tethers-latest-q1-2023-assurance-report-shows-reserves-surplus-at-all-time-high-of-244b-up-148b-in-net-profit-new-categories-for-additional-transparency-reveals-bitcoin-and-gold-allocations/">released</a> its Q1 2023 financial report, revealing an impressive net profit of $1.5 billion. BDO Italia, an auditing firm, attested to the accuracy of the report, adding credibility to the figures.<br /><br />The reserves report provided a comprehensive breakdown of Tether&#8217;s assets as of March 31, showcasing a significant increase in reserves to $2.44 billion. Notably, the report introduced new asset categories, such as physical gold, diversifying Tether&#8217;s holdings. Additionally, the first quarter witnessed remarkable growth in both profit and token circulation, with a 20% increase.<br /><br />Tether&#8217;s total consolidated assets amounted to a staggering $81.8 billion, with a substantial portion invested in US Treasury bills. In a strategic move to enhance security and liquidity for its users, Tether revealed its plan to reduce reliance on traditional bank deposits and instead engage with the repo market.<br /><br />Paolo Ardoino, the CTO of Tether, expressed satisfaction with the net profits, highlighting how they underscored the platform&#8217;s stability. Ardoino emphasized Tether&#8217;s continuous monitoring of the global economic landscape to safeguard customer funds. However, concerns have been raised by former SEC official John Reed Stark regarding Tether&#8217;s operations.<br /><br />Stark cautioned that an attestation report should not be equated with a conventional financial audit, casting doubt on the financial stability of a firm like Tether that operates without a certified financial audit. He also raised concerns about Tether&#8217;s regulatory status, pointing out its lack of SEC registration and investor protection. Stark&#8217;s remarks highlight the importance of ongoing scrutiny of Tether&#8217;s operations and regulatory compliance.<br /><br />While Tether&#8217;s Q1 performance paints a lucrative picture, the company must address the concerns raised by industry experts and regulatory bodies to ensure transparency and build trust within the crypto community.</p>

<p>Data from <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_average_transaction_fee">ycharts.com</a> shows that the average transaction fee for Bitcoin has spiked to $30.91, a level not seen since April 2021. The period leading up to April 2021 was marked by Bitcoin&#8217;s surge to $64,900, fueled by Coinbase&#8217;s NASDAQ listing and the narrative that crypto was going mainstream. <br /><br />However, this run came to an abrupt end when China extended its anti-crypto policy to ban proof-of-work mining and Tesla <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/12/elon-musk-says-tesla-will-stop-accepting-bitcoin-for-car-purchases.html">announced</a> it would stop accepting BTC for vehicle purchases due to environmental concerns.<br /><br />Currently, <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/dogecoin-real-life-currency-or-meme-coin-only/">meme coin</a> mania is driving activity on the Bitcoin network via the recently released BRC-20 standard. BRC-20 was created in March by an anonymous individual known as &#8220;<a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-bitcoin-brc-20-tokens/">Domo</a>&#8221; and allows fungible assets to operate on the Bitcoin chain. Taproot, launched in November 2021, enabled this by making transactions quicker and more cost-effective, laying the groundwork for smart contracts and dApps. However, this has led to higher transaction fees and chain bloat, as warned by commentators at the time.<br /><br />The top three BRC-20 tokens by market cap are Ordi, Nals, and Pepe, valued at $411.3 million, $42.3 million, and $34.7 million, respectively, according to the <a href="https://brc-20.io/">brc-20.io</a> website. Despite the triviality of some token names, some experts believe that BRC-20 tokens will be a significant factor in driving Bitcoin dominance and rendering Ethereum irrelevant in the next bull market.<br /><br />Willy Woo points out that while there are pros and cons to the current situation, an alternative source of mining revenue is needed to keep miners incentivized as block rewards will be zero one day. However, the trade-off is &#8220;bad for nodes and decentralization,&#8221; especially since the impact of Ordinals is happening at a time when mining rewards are still high.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/paypals-crypto-cache-surges-to-604-million-by-2022-end/">PayPal</a> has announced that it now holds $943 million in customers&#8217; crypto assets, representing a 56% increase from the previous quarter. The company allows users in some regions to buy, hold, sell, and pay for purchases using cryptocurrency. However, PayPal doesn&#8217;t hold any cryptocurrencies on its balance sheet other than those belonging to its customers.<br /><br />According to the latest Q1 2023<a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001633917/195d9afa-779f-4932-b227-90f0a170923e.pdf"> Form 10-Q SEC filing,</a> customers&#8217; crypto deposits surged from $604 million in the prior quarter to $943 million as of March 31. Bitcoin was the most popular cryptocurrency in terms of current holdings and quarter-over-quarter percentage increase, spiking 71% to just short of half a billion dollars. Ethereum, the second-most held cryptocurrency, saw a 45% increase in deposits, while &#8220;Other,&#8221; consisting of Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin, saw gains of plus 30%.<br /><br />PayPal noted that accounting for cryptocurrency involves several risks, including technological, legal, and regulatory risks, which is why crypto assets are recorded as both a liability and an asset on their books.<br /><br />Although the total crypto market experienced a significant increase of 49%, rising from $796 billion on December 31, 2022, to $1,183 billion on March 31, 2023, the exact <a href="https://investor.pypl.com/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx">breakdown</a> of PayPal customers&#8217; holdings is unclear. <br /><br />Therefore, it is uncertain precisely how much of the 56% quarter-over-quarter increase in deposits relates to increased crypto holdings or the increase in dollar value over that period. However, the majority of the increase likely relates to an increase in the dollar value of holdings rather than a jump in customers&#8217; deposits.</p>

While he did not disclose whether the country plans to adopt the cryptocurrency as legal tender, citizens will be allowed to settle government services in Bitcoin, with the option for authorities to swap the crypto assets for Swiss francs. <br /><br />This move<a href="https://www.liechtensteinusa.org/article/liechtensteins-parliament-approves-blockchain-act-unanimously"> follows</a> the passage of the <em>&#8220;Blockchain Act,&#8221;</em> which set clear standards in the sector and provided maximum protection to users. Additionally, Liechtenstein&#8217;s leading private bank, LGT Bank, partnered with SEBA Bank in 2022 to enable direct investments in digital currencies for its clients.<br /><br />Switzerland&#8217;s city of Lugano, Liechtenstein&#8217;s western neighbor, has also made moves toward adopting cryptocurrencies. The domestic authorities have developed an infrastructure to make Bitcoin, Tether, and LVGA tokens official means of settlement in the region. This initiative, called PlanB, aims to enable locals to pay taxes or public service fees via the aforementioned assets. <br /><br /><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/tether-utilized-signature-bank-to-gain-access-to-us-financial-market/">Tether</a> outlined in March this year that the initiative has been quite successful during the first year of its existence, with more than 150 domestic merchants accepting BTC, USDT, and LVGA as payment methods, while the total number could surpass 2,500 by the end of 2023.<br /><br />The move towards cryptocurrencies in Liechtenstein and Switzerland highlights the increasing acceptance and mainstream adoption of digital assets worldwide. However, it remains to be seen if Liechtenstein will follow in the footsteps of El Salvador and the Central African Republic and adopt BTC as legal tender.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/08/ripple-will-have-spent-200-million-fighting-sec-lawsuit-ceo-says.html">CNBC report</a> on May 8, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse discussed the regulatory hurdles his company is facing during the Dubai Fintech Summit. <br /><br />Garlinghouse revealed that <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ripple-president-responds-to-multibillion-dollar-win-in-crucial-market/">Ripple</a> has spent a whopping $200 million defending itself against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawsuit, which he claims &#8220;doesn&#8217;t make a lot of sense&#8221; from its inception. <br /><br />This was the first time Garlinghouse has publicly disclosed the cost of the legal conflict, and he argues that the U.S. is<em> &#8220;definitely stuck&#8221;</em> when it comes to regulation.<br /><br />In response to the regulatory landscape in the U.S., Garlinghouse announced via <a href="https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1655563716795170818">Twitter</a> that Ripple plans to expand to Dubai. He highlighted that the MENA region, where 20% of Ripple&#8217;s customers are based, has<em> &#8220;clear regulatory regimes&#8221;</em> and is on its way to becoming a global financial hub.<br /><br />Ripple has been facing regulatory challenges since December 2020, when the SEC accused Ripple and its executives of breaching securities regulations by selling XRP tokens.<br /><br />Ripple isn&#8217;t the only company attempting to challenge the SEC, with cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase also preparing to take on the regulator after receiving a Wells notice. It remains unclear whether Ripple&#8217;s or Coinbase&#8217;s challenge will succeed.</p>

<p>According to recent data from crypto-analytic firm <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1654355262638288897">Santiment</a>, the Ethereum network has reached an eight-month high in active deposits. <br /><br />This metric includes all incoming and outgoing transactions involving deposit addresses, including user-to-exchange and exchange-to-wallet transactions.<br /><br />However, this surge in deposits could potentially lead to increased volatility in Ethereum&#8217;s price. Such volatility could have a similar impact as the blockchain&#8217;s transition from PoW to PoS during Merge or FTX&#8217;s collapse.<br /><br />Despite the widely expected 25 basis point interest rate hike by the Fed, Ether&#8217;s price has remained stagnant within a narrow range due to low trading volume. The <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/eth-price-analysis-what-awaits-eth-ethereum-developer-gives-key-determinant-for-shanghai-mainnet-launch-date/">Shapella upgrade</a>, which took place on April 12th, also failed to impress investors, as the asset only increased by 3% after the event.<br /><br />While it is unclear which direction Ether&#8217;s price will take in the short term, data suggests that there is increased selling pressure on the asset. Whales holding 1,000 to 10,000 ETH have offloaded a significant amount of tokens over the past two weeks, which has contributed to the suppression of the price.<br /><br />Furthermore, on May 2nd, ETH saw a transfer of $505 million to crypto exchange <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/binance-faces-doj-investigation-for-alleged-violation-of-russian-sanctions/">Binance</a>. This level of exchange inflow was last seen before the Merge and is generally considered a bearish indication, as investors depositing their ETH tokens on exchanges are typically preparing to sell.</p>

The DOJ’s criminal division is also said to be conducting a separate ongoing inquiry.<br /><br />As per sources, the DOJ&#8217;s national security division is currently investigating the potential violation of Russian sanctions by Binance, along with another ongoing inquiry by the DOJ&#8217;s criminal division. <br /><br />No charges have been filed, and the exchange has not been officially named as part of the investigation. Binance is also said to have engaged with the DOJ to resolve issues relating to Iranian sanctions evasion.<br /><br />In March, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) charged Binance with permitting illegal access to commodities by its users.

<p>North Carolina has become the latest state to ban <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/u-s-central-bank-digital-currency-is-inevitable-says-federal-reserve-official/">central bank digital currency</a> (CBDC) payments and testing. Lawmakers in North Carolina have passed a bill to ban central bank digital currency (CBDC) payments and block the state from participating in testing, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/Dennis_Porter_/status/1653918920305414146">Dennis Porter</a>, co-founder of the Satoshi Action Fund.<br /><br />The digital dollar, which was previously touted as a potential solution for reducing currency system costs, cross-border payment friction, and counterfeiting, seems to have taken a backseat to the FedNow instant payment service, which is set to launch in <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/03/16/fednow-fed-digital-dollar-stablecoins-cbdc/">July</a>. <br /><br />However, critics have raised concerns about personal privacy infringement, centralization of power, and security breaches, which could make the system vulnerable to hacking.<br /><br />The progress of the digital dollar has appeared to have stalled in favor of the FedNow instant payment service, which is scheduled to launch in July.<br /><br />Former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan has suggested that FedNow is a precursor to the digital dollar system. Supporters say CBDCs reduce the cost of running a currency system and reduce cross-border payment friction, but critics raise concerns about privacy, centralization, and security. <br /><br />Catherine Fitts, a former US government official, has criticized CBDCs, calling them a “financial transaction control grid.” <br /><br />She urged viewers not to believe the propaganda that they are convenient and necessary. Florida and North Carolina have passed anti-CBDC legislation, with <a href="https://twitter.com/Dennis_Porter_/status/1653918457396879361">Porter</a> claiming &#8220;we are winning.&#8221; <br /><br />Senator Ted Cruz has <a href="https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-cruz-introduces-legislation-to-prohibit-the-fed-from-establishing-a-central-bank-digital-currency">introduced</a> legislation to prohibit the development of a digital dollar, arguing that it would stifle innovation and freedom.</p>

The company reported that it has replaced these banks&#8217; 24/7 instant settlement services and onboarded new partners to ensure redundancy.<br /><br />The news of Coinbase&#8217;s positive financial report has boosted its stock, with <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/coinbase-gains-regulatory-approval-to-operate-in-bermuda/">COIN</a> up 1.51% today and up 7.05% after hours.
