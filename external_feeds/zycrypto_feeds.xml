<ul>
<li>BlackRock’s BTC ETF is strengthening investor confidence in the market after consecutive weeks of outflows.</li>



<li>Outflows slowed down drastically from $88 million in the past week to $5 million this week after the news of the ETF.</li>



<li>In another development, Bitcoin has regained over 50% of its market dominance for the first time in two years.</li>
</ul>



<p>If BlackRock’s ETF becomes the real deal, it could cause a new shift for the market, which has suffered regulatory hurdles and plunging values in recent weeks, observers say.</p>



<p>A new report from CoinShares shows that the massive outflows from the digital asset market are cooling down gradually after the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-primed-for-trillion-dollar-boost-as-blackrock-expects-landmark-bitcoin-etf-approval/">BlackRock ETF filing</a> last week. According to CoinShares, this week marks the ninth consecutive week of outflows after a good run in Q1 2023. In the past nine weeks, the withdrawals for mutual funds, exchange-traded products, and over-the-counter (OTC) trusts have surpassed $423 million.</p>



<p>This week has witnessed a huge turn, with investor confidence rising, as seen by reduced outflows. Investors have withdrawn $5.1 million this week against $88 million the previous week, with other indices also pointing to growing positive sentiments.</p>



<p>CoinShares points to the ETF filing as a major determinant of the boost in investor confidence. On Friday, inflows of $5 million were tracked across several products. James Butterfill, the Head of Research at CoinShares, noted that these inflows were not enough to offset the previous outflows, but it shows strong signs of progress.</p>



<p>“<em>The end of the week saw minor inflows following the news that one of the world’s largest asset managers has applied for Bitcoin ETP in the U.S., although these inflows were not enough to offset outflows seen earlier in the week.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-altcoins-lead-outflows-in-the-united-states"><strong>Altcoins lead outflows in the United States</strong></h2>



<p>Since the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://zycrypto.com/crypto-community-roots-for-binance-amid-secs-motion-to-freeze-binance-us-assets/">launched</a> its renewed offensive on digital assets, altcoins have taken the most heat. This has led to plunging values of most assets as they were alleged to be securities by the SEC.</p>



<p>According to the report, products tracking the price of Ethereum recorded outflows of $5 million this past week. Other assets, including Cardano (ADA) and Polygon (MATIC), also posted massive losses after being described as securities in the Coinbase lawsuit. While Ripple (XRP) gained 4.7% in the last 30 days, ADA and MATIC plummeted 17% and 29%, respectively.</p>



<p>US investors accounted for $3.7 million worth of deposits last week despite the crackdown. Also, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has surged following the news of BlackRock’s filing and accounts for 85% of weekly inflows. </p>

<ul>
<li>Bitcoin has surged over 8% to break through the $30,000 level for the first time since May, with bulls keeping pressure on the pedal.</li>



<li>BlackRock’s ETF filing is critical to the uphill climb alongside the launch of Wall Street-backed exchange EDX.</li>



<li>The major rally has seen Bitcoin bears lose $36.6 million in the past 24 hours, the month&#8217;s highest short squeeze.</li>
</ul>



<p>The digital asset market is back in the green as more institutional investors eye top assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). The latest surge has raised the market cap by 5% to $1.17 trillion.</p>



<p>The price of BTC has spiked above $30,000 in the last 24 hours, surging above 7.8% and exchanges hands for $30,038 at press time. This is the first time the largest cryptocurrency by market cap is rising above the $30k resistance after it slipped through in May according to CoinMarketCap.</p>



<p>The uphill climb of BTC is <a href="https://zycrypto.com/blackrocks-spot-bitcoin-etf-application-triggers-massive-btc-accumulation/">fueled</a> by the spot BTC Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) filing by asset management firm BlackRock. After the filing, Bitcoin reclaimed its 50% market dominance for the first time in two years, setting the tone for institutional interest in the asset. The filing initially saw BTC trade above 12% to gain lost ground following the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawsuit against Binance and Coinbase.</p>



<p>The lawsuit led to a sharp decline in many altcoins, but the ripple effect of the BTC ETF filing can be seen in the prices of other assets. Over the past 24 hours, Ethereum has increased 4.95% to trade above $1,800 after slipping last week. Cardano, Solana, and Dogecoin are also up by 7.79%, 5.4%, and 3.61%, respectively. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-institutional-investors-light-the-path-for-bulls"><strong>Institutional investors light the path for bulls</strong></h2>



<p>A key factor in the recent surge is the renewed appetite of institutional investors to get their hands on more digital assets. BlackRock is the largest asset management firm, and the filing of the BTC ETF has sparked new institutional confidence in the market.</p>



<p>Although the SEC has consistently <a href="https://zycrypto.com/secs-hurdles-against-btc-spot-etf-highly-suspicious-chamber-of-digital-commerce-warns/">refused</a> a spot ETF application, including those from 21Shares and ARK, the application by BlackRock came as a lifeline for BTC bulls amid damaging regulatory moves by the Commission. Also, the emergence of EDX, a digital asset exchange backed by several Wall Street firms, including Fidelity Investments, Citadel Securities, and Charles Schwab heightened the uphill run of Bitcoin.</p>



<p>As more institutional investors become attracted to crypto assets, several observers feel the SEC will tone down its aggressive regulatory stance. Meanwhile, crypto enthusiasts have received the news of EDX with great optimism as healthy competition will strengthen the market.</p>

<ul>
<li>Analysts at JPMorgan believe that the recently released Hinman documents will benefit Ethereum in the long run.</li>



<li>The financial institution states that the documents would see other altcoins become more like Ethereum to dodge the regulator&#8217;s hammer.</li>



<li>The price of altcoins has taken a major hit, with many top assets losing up to 20% since the recent regulatory push by the SEC. </li>
</ul>



<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple may have ripple effects on the entire market before the final determination of the case.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-demands-investigation-into-former-sec-director-hinman-and-his-controversial-speech/">release</a> of the documents associated with popular former SEC director William Hinman has been described as a turning point in the case for SEC. Still, right now, it could affect other assets, with Ethereum standing as the biggest gainer. Experts at JPMorgan have stated in a recent report that the released documents will trigger a more decentralized market with Ethereum used as a model.</p>



<p>The whole controversy was sparked via an email from Hinman in 2018 which stated that ether was not a security. According to the report, top figures at the SEC did not regard ether as a security in 2018, as they noted that the “<em>fact that tokens on a sufficiently decentralized network are no longer securities creates a regulatory gap.” </em></p>



<p>Analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote that the Howey Test was used to draw up those conclusions by the Commission. The hallmark of the Howey Test is that an asset will be classified as a security if there is an investment capital in a common enterprise with the reasonable expectation of profits.</p>



<p><em>“The speech acknowledges that there is another category. It is not a security because there is no controlling group yet there may be a need for regulation to protect purchasers.”</em> Panigirtzoglou commented on the Commission&#8217;s position.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-regulation-is-long-overdue">New regulation is long overdue</h2>



<p>The report by the Wall Street giant points to the fact that a new regulation is needed to balance the regulatory uncertainty opened by the Hinman documents. The Commission&#8217;s stance explains why it has not charged Ethereum while going after several <a href="https://zycrypto.com/this-is-an-opportunity-to-get-rule-clarity-in-court-coinbase-stresses-on-the-positive-amid-sec-lawsuit/">altcoins</a> this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>The Hinman documents are likely to influence the direction of the current U.S. congressional effort to regulate the crypto industry in a way that ether would avoid being designated as a security,” </em>JP Morgan wrote.</p>



<p>According to the firm, a new category could be created, which will comprise Ethereum and other altcoins that are decentralized to a certain level to avoid being termed securities. Alternatively, Congress can step in and categorize Ethereum with Bitcoin, which the Commission&#8217;s chairman Gary Gensler has hinted is not a security. This will place Ethereum and Bitcoin under the oversight jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).</p>

<p>Among what appears to be much internal division at the SEC, Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seem to be on the same page regarding the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-prominent-securities-attorney-on-why-the-released-hinman-emails-are-a-huge-nothingburger/">Hinman Emails</a>, a set of documents that have sparked intense debate in the ongoing legal battle between the two parties.</p>



<p>The emails, which shed light on the SEC&#8217;s internal discussions about the regulatory status of cryptocurrencies, have been the subject of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-demands-investigation-into-former-sec-director-hinman-and-his-controversial-speech/">much scrutiny and speculation</a>. While some expected the emails to impact the SEC&#8217;s crypto policy significantly, their influence may be more limited than initially thought.</p>



<p>The Hinman Emails&#8217; revelation that the SEC had previously been unsure about Ethereum&#8217;s (ETH) legal standing never resulted in any official commission-approved rules or guidelines. This implies that the agency&#8217;s earlier statements, such as those made by William Hinman, the former director of the SEC&#8217;s corporation finance division, may not be as authoritative as formal regulatory rulings. As a result, the emails may have a more subtle effect on the SEC&#8217;s crypto policy than many may have hoped.</p>



<p>Ripple Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty nevertheless jumped on Twitter to comment: <em>“It’s been 5 years since Bill Hinman gave his infamous speech – and through the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple (and 7 court orders), we can finally share what happened behind the scenes through the now public emails/drafts of the speech.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The emails offer a glimpse into the SEC&#8217;s internal conversations but do not have the same legal standing as established rules or standards. Ripple&#8217;s legal team has used the lack of official regulations governing the status of cryptocurrencies to argue that the SEC&#8217;s case against them is based on a false premise. The SEC and Ripple agreeing that the Hinman Emails had no impact may support Ripple&#8217;s claim that the agency&#8217;s enforcement efforts are unclear and inconsistent.</p>



<p>The emails show SEC internal discussions but don&#8217;t offer a clear position on how cryptocurrencies should be regulated. Different parties may interpret the emails and their consequences, and the court will eventually decide whether or not they are relevant to the ongoing case.</p>



<p>One can question the SEC&#8217;s motives and argue that the agency&#8217;s actions might be influenced by things other than clear regulations, such as safeguarding the interests of conventional financial institutions. The emails have intensified the existing discussion about how the SEC regulates the cryptocurrency market and raised questions about its consistency and potential effects on innovation.</p>



<p>While the alignment between Ripple and the SEC on the limited significance of the Hinman Emails may not bring about a dramatic shift in the agency&#8217;s crypto policy, it adds an interesting dimension to the legal battle between the two parties. Even if the emails reveal the SEC&#8217;s internal deliberations, they could not carry the same legal weight or have the same impact as some had wished.</p>



<p>The current legal dispute between Ripple and the SEC has already triggered discussions regarding the broader consequences for the cryptocurrency sector. The <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-google-bard-ai-predicts-outcome-of-sec-case-major-win-for-ripple-imminent/">outcome of this lawsuit</a> and the way the court interprets the Hinman Emails may have significant repercussions for the regulatory environment. The court&#8217;s ruling will greatly influence future cryptocurrency regulatory guidelines in the Ripple case. It&#8217;s also likely that other legislative and regulatory organizations will be influenced by the conclusion and change how they operate.</p>

<p>Bitcoin, the world&#8217;s leading cryptocurrency, has recently experienced a notable surge in its <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1670859563246178304">Age Consumed metric</a> over the past 24 hours. This spike in Age Consumed suggests that previously dormant addresses holding Bitcoin are now re-entering circulation, indicating a revival in network activity. Such occurrences often act as a precursor to potential price jumps in the Bitcoin market. In this article, we delve into the significance of Age Consumed and explore how it can indicate increasing network activity and its potential impact on Bitcoin&#8217;s price.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-age-consumed"><strong>Understanding Age Consumed</strong></h2>



<p>Age Consumed is a metric that measures the movement of previously inactive Bitcoin addresses: when Bitcoin held in dormant wallets is transferred, the Age Consumed increases. This metric is valuable for analyzing network activity and identifying periods of heightened market interest. By tracking Age Consumed, analysts can gain insights into the behaviour of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/long-term-bitcoin-holders-defy-market-uncertainty-setting-the-stage-for-further-growth/">long-term investors</a> and the flow of Bitcoin between different market participants.</p>



<p>The recent surge in Bitcoin&#8217;s Age Consumed points towards renewed vigour within the network. Stagnant addresses that have held Bitcoin for an extended period are now starting to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/satoshi-era-bitcoin-whale-moves-1-2-million-worth-of-btc-after-13-years/">circulate their holdings</a>. This movement signifies increased activity among Bitcoin holders and suggests a shift from long-term investment to more active trading. When many dormant addresses begin to transact, it often indicates growing interest and participation in the Bitcoin market.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Implications for price movements</strong></h2>



<p>Historically, periods of heightened Age Consumed have correlated with notable <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-pierces-30000-for-first-time-since-june-as-bernstein-calls-btc-faster-horse-compared-to-gold/">price jumps</a> in the Bitcoin market. As dormant addresses become active and Bitcoin begins to circulate more actively, it can generate increased buying and selling pressure. This surge in trading volume and market participation often translates into significant price movements. Investors and traders closely monitor Age Consumed as a potential leading indicator of price volatility, allowing them to make informed decisions regarding their Bitcoin holdings.</p>



<p>Several factors contribute to the rise in Age Consumed. Firstly, increasing <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-primed-for-trillion-dollar-boost-as-blackrock-expects-landmark-bitcoin-etf-approval/">market speculation</a> and the entrance of new participants can prompt dormant addresses to become active, thereby driving up the metric. Additionally, significant news events, regulatory developments, or technological advancements can spark interest in Bitcoin, leading to increased network activity. Considering these external factors alongside Age Consumed is essential to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the evolving Bitcoin market dynamics.</p>



<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s Age Consumed surge in the past 24 hours reflects a resurgence in <a href="https://zycrypto.com/10-year-dormant-bitcoin-whale-emerges-rakes-in-astonishing-38-million-profit/">network activity</a>. The movement of previously stagnant addresses suggests an increased willingness among Bitcoin holders to participate in the market actively. As Bitcoin&#8217;s network activity grows, it remains an exciting time for enthusiasts and investors alike as they navigate the evolving landscape of the world&#8217;s most prominent cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>The price of bitcoin enjoyed a renewed rally overnight as more spot ETF applications fueled a sentiment boost. The benchmark cryptocurrency is up 8.07% today, trading hands just above $29,000.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bitcoin-price-gathers-upside-traction"><strong>Bitcoin Price Gathers Upside Traction</strong></h2>



<p>Crypto’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap is back in vogue.</p>



<p>Bitcoin briefly hit $29,000 on June 21 before cooling off a little. BTC now trades at $29,051.25, according to CoinGecko data. The top crypto looks set to explore a move toward $30,000 levels in the near term.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="646" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-15-1024x646.png" alt="" class="wp-image-82227" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-15-1024x646.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-15-300x189.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-15-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-15-1536x970.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-15-2048x1293.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTCUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Ethereum (ETH) was also in the green, notching a 4.9% daily increase. Cardano&#8217;s ADA — which recently <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-flashes-dreaded-death-cross-despite-launching-cutting-edge-node-version-on-mainnet/">underwent a significant software upgrade</a> — rallied 8.1%, posting one of the biggest single-day gains this month.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the global crypto market capitalization was sitting at $1.18 trillion — up 5.9% from the previous day.</p>



<p>The biggest factor behind the crypto rally is likely the wave of new Bitcoin ETF filings.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>WisdomTree, Invesco Quickly Following BlackRock</strong></h2>



<p>Hopes surrounding<a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-primed-for-trillion-dollar-boost-as-blackrock-expects-landmark-bitcoin-etf-approval/"> a potential physical bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) by investment giant BlackRock</a> fueled a bullish sentiment among traders last week.  Two new U.S.-based investment firms have now submitted applications to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for investment vehicles tied to the OG cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>A bitcoin ETF is a product that tracks the crypto&#8217;s value, seeking to expose investors to BTC&#8217;s price performance without needing them to own and hold the underlying asset directly. This means investors can buy shares of the ETF, which symbolize ownership of a pool of Bitcoin held by the fund, instead of buying and storing the leading crypto.</p>



<p>New York-based asset manager WisdomTree asked that the SEC allow it to list its “WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust” on the Cboe BZX Exchange under the ticker “BTCW in a June 20 filing. The company has previously made two attempts to get approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF. Its first application was rejected by the SEC in December 2021, while the second application was denied in October 2022 for insufficient investor protection.</p>



<p>Atlanta-based investment management firm Invesco also reapplied for a bitcoin ETF in light of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/blackrocks-spot-bitcoin-etf-application-triggers-massive-btc-accumulation/">BlackRock’s filing</a>. In the Tuesday application, Invesco requested that the top American financial regulator allow its “Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF” product to be listed on the Cboe BZX exchange. The filing argues that the lack of a spot Bitcoin ETF “exposes U.S. investor assets to significant risk” as they “are forced to find alternative exposure through generally riskier means.”</p>



<p>In addition to the new applications from WisdomTree and Invesco, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bullish-fidelity-investments-rumored-to-be-close-to-filing-for-blackrock-like-spot-bitcoin-etf/">rumors </a>that the multi-trillion-dollar fund manager Fidelity Investments may also be looking to take advantage of the enlivened craze for spot Bitcoin ETFs have begun swirling.</p>



<p>The SEC has in the past repeatedly squashed all efforts to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF. The flurry of new filings triggered by BlackRock’s application last week can indicate asset management behemoths recognizing the increasing demand for regulated investment products in the cryptocurrency market.</p>



<p>The jury’s still out on whether this changes the SEC’s outlook on the subject.</p>

<p>Cardano’s native token ADA has printed a death cross technical pattern for the first time since December 2021, suggesting more pain could be ahead for the coin.</p>



<p>The scary death cross event comes even as the network rolls out the latest Node version, 8.1.1, on the mainnet.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-ada-on-the-cusp-of-a-steep-selloff"><strong>Is ADA On The Cusp Of A Steep Selloff?</strong></h2>



<p>Cardano’s daily price chart has painted a death cross.</p>



<p>For those unaware, a death cross is a technical term from the world of traditional stock investing and describes an event when an asset’s short-term 50-day moving average moves below its long-term 200-day moving average. The chart pattern is a warning of a more profound price drop.</p>



<p>According to Trading View, ADA’s 50-day line crossed the 200-day line in a downward direction over the weekend, signalling a bearish crossover that typically prompts traders to sell.</p>



<p>Death crosses are never good. However, they are often welcomed by crypto aficionados as an opportunity to buy the asset at a discounted price. As veteran investor Warren Buffett once famously stated, “Buy when there’s blood in the streets.” The phrase basically translates to buy when everyone else is selling.</p>



<p>Notably, the apocalyptic-sounding chart pattern comes as an upgrade to reduce epoch transitions to make the Cardano chain smoother for network users went live on the mainnet on Monday.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Upgrade 8.1.1 Unleashes Top-Level Performance On ADA Mainnet</strong></h2>



<p>Cardano community member Rick McCracken <a href="https://twitter.com/RichardMcCrackn/status/1670872681003073536">took to Twitter</a> to note that Node 8.1.1 had been activated on the network. This particular upgrade enhances operations across the blockchain by spreading the previously epoch boundary-focused computations throughout the entire epoch.</p>



<p>Node 8.1.1 alters how epoch calculations are made in a way that hastens network processes during the change in epochs. The update also fixes issues related to peer-to-peer (P2P) network communications and the ADA-based domain name system.</p>



<p>Addressing these concerns ensures a more robust and optimized experience for both new and existing users. The rollout of Node 8.1.1 further proves the continuous dedication of the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-at-5-analysts-set-huge-ada-price-expectations-for-2023-as-key-metrics-surge/">Cardano</a> development team to enhancing its blockchain technology.</p>



<p>That being said, the price trajectory of ADA, despite countless pops and drops over time, has rallied steadily skyward in the long-term — so it is unlikely another encounter with a death cross would spell lasting doom.</p>



<p>ADA was trading at $0.266 at publication time, a 1.29% jump over the last 24 hours.</p>

<p>In an unexpected turn of events, one of Elon Musk’s leading in-house lawyers, who was part of the team fighting the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/dogefather-elon-musk-slapped-with-mammoth-258-billion-lawsuit-for-allegedly-pumping-dogecoin/">$258 billion Dogecoin lawsuit</a>, has left.</p>



<p>This recent development has piqued the crypto community’s interest and raised concern about the lawsuit’s future direction.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-musk-s-legal-team-shake-up"><strong>Musk’s Legal Team Shake-Up</strong></h3>



<p>According to a recent filing in a federal court, Adam Gabor Mehes motioned for leave to withdraw from the $258 billion lawsuit filed by investors alleging the operation of a pyramid scheme to promote Dogecoin. Mehes had been involved in the legal proceedings for a little under a year and actively participated in other legal actions that Tesla/SpaceX CEO Musk was involved in.</p>



<p>As Mehes departed, Tesla’s legal team onboarded another lawyer on Friday, Allison Huebert, to the team representing Musk in the case.</p>



<p>Mired in a year-long legal battle, Musk has repeatedly denied claims of market manipulation and insider trading involving his pet cryptocurrency Dogecoin.</p>



<p>Last week, Musk’s attorney Alex Shapiro <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/06/15/elon-musk-denies-owning-dogecoin-cryptocurrency-wallets/">refuted </a>allegations that the eccentric CEO owns several digital wallets containing millions of dollars worth of Dogecoin. “You specifically allege, without basis, that the following wallets ‘belong’ to Defendants,” Spiro opined in a lawyer’s letter seen by The New York Post. “You are wrong.”</p>



<p>Several market analyses in the past have pointed out that Musk tweeting about Dogecoin oftentimes pushes its price higher. In 2021, Musk endorsed the memecoin with taglines such as “Dogecoin is the people’s crypto&#8221; and proclaimed himself to be the “Dogefather.&#8221; The billionaire investor has also previously <a href="https://zycrypto.com/elon-musks-proposal-to-add-dogecoin-payments-for-twitter-blue-puts-a-meteoric-rally-into-play-for-doge/">discussed </a>the prospect of adding a DOGE payment method for Twitter subscription services. His other ventures, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/elon-musk-drops-major-signal-about-spacexs-starlink-accepting-dogecoin-payments-after-tesla/">Tesla </a>and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/with-spacex-poised-to-accept-dogecoin-payments-for-merch-soon-will-doge-get-its-glory-back/">SpaceX</a>, already accept DOGE as payment for their merch.</p>



<p>Elon Musk’s fate is set to be decided by the United States legal system and the series of accusations against him in the DOGE class action suit. Nevertheless, we can expect his legal team to be adequately staffed and prepared for action.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="1200" height="700" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Crypto-Investment-Giant-Captures-Insane-Market-Demand-With-Another-Week-Of-Massive-Bitcoin-Accumulation.jpg" class="attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Crypto Investment Giant Captures Insane Market Demand With Another Week Of Massive Bitcoin Accumulation" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Crypto-Investment-Giant-Captures-Insane-Market-Demand-With-Another-Week-Of-Massive-Bitcoin-Accumulation.jpg 1200w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Crypto-Investment-Giant-Captures-Insane-Market-Demand-With-Another-Week-Of-Massive-Bitcoin-Accumulation-300x175.jpg 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Crypto-Investment-Giant-Captures-Insane-Market-Demand-With-Another-Week-Of-Massive-Bitcoin-Accumulation-1024x597.jpg 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Crypto-Investment-Giant-Captures-Insane-Market-Demand-With-Another-Week-Of-Massive-Bitcoin-Accumulation-768x448.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p><div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div>
<p>After a long pause, the Bitcoin ETF mania seems to have bounced back with the world&#8217;s largest asset manager BlackRock, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-primed-for-trillion-dollar-boost-as-blackrock-expects-landmark-bitcoin-etf-approval/">applying</a> with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for approval to launch its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).</p>



<p>This development came just days after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) took <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-vs-sec-stakes-just-got-higher-following-binance-coinbase-lawsuits-as-xrp-win-proves-pivotal/">legal action against major exchanges</a> Coinbase and Binance.US for allegedly offering unregistered securities.</p>



<p>A Bitcoin ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) is a financial product that aims to expose investors to Bitcoin through traditional financial markets. It functions similarly to other ETFs but will focus on Bitcoin as the underlying asset. Investors can buy and sell shares of the Bitcoin ETF on stock exchanges, allowing them to gain indirect exposure to Bitcoin&#8217;s price movements without owning or managing the cryptocurrency directly. According to the filing, BlackRock&#8217;s so-called “iShares Bitcoin Trust” intends to collaborate with Coinbase Custody as its custodial partner in securely holding the Bitcoin that forms the foundation of the ETF.</p>



<p>Introducing a Bitcoin ETF is expected to attract a broader range of investors, particularly institutions, to the cryptocurrency market, with various metrics already showing all Bitcoin cohorts are off-distribution and entering light accumulation.</p>



<p>Recent market trends have echoed this sentiment. On Monday, June 9, crypto analytics firm Glassnode reported an increase in the holdings of Bitcoin entities with balances under 100 BTC, which include the so-called <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-shrimps-and-crabs-increase-holdings-by-almost-1-million-btc-amid-price-drop/">“shrimps”</a> and “fish”. According to the firm, these entities absorbed the equivalent of 254% of the mined supply over the past month, approximately 2,286 BTC per day.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/IOtaLfKbc1HGSxe0ujDhYEfgmvASgTV74B68Ybg5yzutaHG_gy3kKtEuVCQpSF1wpS8S4yGb-rXjhAnCbjtVbNxOHouh5DgyjFpUMKIN9vWb6MXxjOr8ZJJvI4yP6QkQnsFPRMabAkFO4IJzcX0ASA" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Moreover, in a separate tweet, Glassnode highlighted a decline in Bitcoin&#8217;s Highly Liquid Supply, reaching a cycle low of 2.94 million BTC, which reflects a decrease of 620,000 BTC since January 2022. Notably, a decrease in liquid supply implies that there is less Bitcoin available for trading overall. This reduction in the actively tradeable supply can influence the price of Bitcoin, as a decrease in supply relative to demand can potentially drive prices higher.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/8X9FxFsIhQbVwzOY5CIqUq2JZxufSJSzk3lK6G_XemhHIxmPVAzWr0st3ntDetwikaz6Wt0h9n8-0Euqf_KiS7qBdbWrX5HFa6T2q6TWIbvfk1QUzadJudLPo8G4TeCVs8DZaCJXPKE3UwNPldKaWQ" alt=""/></figure>



<p>That said, whereas it’s too early to deduce what happens for Bitcoin’s price in the short term, experts have argued that the prospect of a Bitcoin ETF from BlackRock has the potential to fuel interest and investment in the cryptocurrencies further. Moreover, retail will likely follow institutions in buying Bitcoin to avoid missing out (FOMO), pouring a wall of money into Bitcoin, Ether, ADA and other crypto assets.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="646" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-14-1024x646.png" alt="" class="wp-image-82178" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-14-1024x646.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-14-300x189.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-14-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-14-1536x970.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-14-2048x1293.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTCUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $26,644 after a strong close of last week&#8217;s candle. According to popular crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe, BTC must hold atop the $26,000. “<em>If that practically sustains, the odds of upwards continuation is significant,” </em>he <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1670713059801718785">tweeted</a> today.</p>

<p>Uniswap, the world’s second-largest decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol, has announced the upcoming release of Uniswap v4, a highly anticipated upgrade that aims to revolutionize liquidity provision and token trading on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>



<p>In a Tuesday <a href="https://blog.uniswap.org/uniswap-v4">blog</a>, Uniswap highlighted the importance of adapting to evolving technology and market demands. It further introduced an open-source code for its upcoming V4 version so that the public can contribute to the protocol’s development, saying that this inclusive approach aims to foster a robust ecosystem and ensure that Uniswap v4 caters to the diverse needs of its users.</p>



<p>According to the blog, unlike the current version v3, Uniswap v4 introduces a groundbreaking concept called &#8220;hooks,&#8221; which enables users to customize liquidity pools and make better decisions based on their preferences.</p>



<p><em>“Our vision with Uniswap v4 is to allow anyone to make these tradeoff decisions through the introduction of hooks,”</em> Read the blog.</p>



<p>Hooks are contracts that run at various stages of a pool&#8217;s lifecycle, allowing new functionalities and strategies to be added. This flexibility empowers developers to implement dynamic fee structures, onchain limit orders, time-weighted average market makers (TWAMMs), and even integrations with lending protocols and customized oracles.</p>



<p>The introduction of hooks is expected to unlock a wide range of possibilities for liquidity pool customization, promoting innovation and expanding the capabilities of the Uniswap Protocol. Thus, pools will no longer be restricted to a predetermined sequence of actions, allowing developers to experiment and create pools tailored to specific use cases.</p>



<p>Notably, Uniswap v4&#8217;s core logic will be non-upgradeable, ensuring the security and integrity of the protocol while allowing for individual pools to utilize their own hook smart contracts.</p>



<p>Uniswap v4 also brings significant improvements to architecture and gas efficiency. As the protocol operates on the Ethereum blockchain, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/vitalik-buterin-proposes-advanced-ways-to-make-ethereum-gas-fees-fairer/">gas fees</a> have historically been a concern. Currently, Uniswap v3 requires a new contract for each pool. As per the blog, Uniswap v4 will change that by consolidating all pools within a single &#8220;singleton&#8221; contract.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This architectural enhancement will streamline pool creation and reduce gas costs by a staggering 99%. Additionally, Uniswap v4 incorporates a &#8220;flash accounting&#8221; system that optimizes asset transfers, resulting in further gas savings and overall efficiency.</p>



<p>That said, the unveiling of Uniswap v4 represents a significant milestone in the evolution of decentralized finance (DeFi). Building upon the success of Uniswap v3, which has already established itself as a leading decentralized exchange protocol processing over $1.5 trillion in trading volume, the forthcoming launch of Uniswap v4 is expected further to propel the decentralized finance ecosystem towards accelerated decentralization efforts.</p>

<p>In a June 15, 2023 press release, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) alleged that the crypto exchange OKCoin USA Inc violated the Federal Deposit Insurance Act by making false and misleading statements regarding its insured status with the FDIC on its website and in a social media post.</p>



<p>Through a cease and desist letter, the FDIC requested OKCoin to address what it referred to as false and misleading statements. The FDIC said that OkCoin claimed to offer FDIC insurance of USD deposits for its US customers.</p>



<p>The FDIC said OkCoin’s statements were likely misleading and potentially harmful to consumers. The FDIC requested OKCoin to immediately remove all information, representations, or references suggesting that OKCoin is FDIC-insured.</p>



<p>The FDIC gave OKCoin 15 business days on receipt of its cease and desist letter to provide written confirmation that it had fully compiled. Other companies that received cease and desist orders from the FDIC on June 15, 2023, were Bodega (Bodega Importadora de Pallets) and Money Avenue, LLC.</p>



<p>The FDIC has issued several cease and desist letters in the past to firms contravening the Federal Deposit Insurance Act that prohibits any person or entity from representing or implying that an uninsured deposit is insured under the FDI Act.</p>



<p>In August 2022, the FDIC issued letters demanding five companies(Cryptonews.com, Cryptosec.info, SmartAsset.com, FTX.US, and FDICCrypto.com) and their officers, directors, and employees to stop making false and misleading statements about FDIC deposit insurance.</p>



<p>In July 2022, the FDIC issued a cease and desist letter to Voyager Digital, LLC, and its related entities for making false and misleading statements concerning Voyager’s deposit insurance status.</p>



<p>In the letter to Voyager, the FDIC said that Voyager had made various representations on its website, mobile app, and social media accounts, suggesting that it was FDIC-insured and that the FDIC had insured customers against the failure of Voyager.</p>



<p>According to the new rules shared by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) in a press release dated June 8, 2023, the FCA requested crypto firms to ensure investors have the appropriate knowledge and experience to invest in crypto.</p>



<p>The FCA advised crypto firms marketing crypto assets to UK consumers to offer a cooling-off period for first-time investors to offer more protection to consumers. Consumer protection is at the heart of the formation of crypto regulations.</p>



<p>The FCA further requested firms promoting crypto to use transparent and fair adverts and to put in place clear risk warnings that are not misleading. The FCA asked for more guidance for firms advertising crypto to UK consumers.</p>



<p>The conduct of crypto firms remains under scrutiny by financial regulators and watchdogs.</p>

<p>According to a June 17, 2023 press release, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has secured emergency relief against Binance Holdings Limited. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao also agreed to repatriate to the United States (US) all assets for Binance.US customers.</p>



<p>The court order issued from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia will allow Binance.US customers to withdraw their assets from the Binance.US platform, and any customer&#8217;s funds on the platform will remain in the US till the resolution of the SEC’s pending litigation against Binance Holdings Ltd.</p>



<p>Other requirements by the order include the prohibition of the defendants from destroying records, transferring any assets or funds to Binance Holdings Limited, Changpeng Zhao, or their affiliates, and a restriction on spending assets or funds except for ordinary course business expenses.</p>



<p>As per a June 5, 2023 press release, the SEC filed 13 charges against Binance, its entities, and its CEO Changpeng Zhao that included operating unregistered exchanges, misrepresenting trading controls and oversight on the Binance.US platform, and the offering and selling of unregistered securities.</p>



<p>According to a June 6, 2023 press release, the SEC had filed an emergency action seeking a temporary restraining order to freeze, repatriate and ensure that the assets held for the benefit of customers of the Binance.US crypto trading platform remain in the US.</p>



<p>On June 14, 2023, the federal judge overseeing the SEC’s case against Binance.US declined to order a temporary restraining order freezing the U.S. trading platform&#8217;s assets and requested the parties to agree on limits to a compromise solution by June 15, 2023.</p>



<p>Binance has been in the news lately, facing various regulatory actions worldwide. Regulatory action against Binance is generally considered significant as Binance is the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volumes.</p>



<p>On June 16, 2023, Binance announced they were exiting the Dutch market, citing failure to obtain a virtual asset service provider (VASP) registration with the Dutch regulator. Binance advised its users in the Netherlands to withdraw their funds and that no other trading or deposits would be possible.</p>



<p>Binance France is reportedly under investigation by French prosecutors for breaching anti-money laundering procedures and advertising its services before registering with the financial markets regulator. Binance was registered with France’s financial markets regulator in May 2022.</p>



<p>And according to the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission, Binance Cyprus Limited has applied for deregistration.</p>

<p>The outcome remains uncertain in the riveting legal battle between <a href="https://zycrypto.com/former-sec-director-says-judgment-on-ripple-vs-sec-lawsuit-to-come-within-days-xrp-to-10/">Ripple</a> and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However, a recent analysis from Google Bard AI sheds light on Ripple&#8217;s potential for a significant victory. As the case continues to unfold, numerous factors come into play, influencing the ultimate verdict. In this article, we delve into the key arguments provided by Google Bard AI supporting both Ripple&#8217;s triumph and potential downfall.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-xrp-security-debate"><strong>The XRP Security Debate</strong></h2>



<p>At the core of the SEC&#8217;s case against Ripple lies the assertion that XRP should be classified as a security. Yet, the crypto community remains deeply <a href="https://zycrypto.com/why-pro-ripple-lawyer-says-xrp-cant-be-classed-as-a-security-even-if-it-was-sold-as-one/">divided</a> on this matter. While some experts vehemently oppose such categorization, others see plausible arguments for XRP as a security. The SEC&#8217;s evidence backing their claim lacks clarity, leaving room for doubt and further debate.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ripple&#8217;s Legal Team</strong></h2>



<p>Fortifying its position, Ripple has assembled a legal team comprised of the country&#8217;s <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-and-coinbases-top-legal-minds-hold-offsite-meeting-is-an-xrp-relisting-closer-than-ever/">top legal minds</a>. These seasoned lawyers bring an impressive track record of victories in complex cases, bolstering Ripple&#8217;s prospects for success. With their wealth of experience and expertise, they are prepared to tackle the SEC head-on and defend Ripple&#8217;s interests vigorously.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Support From Crypto Community</strong></h2>



<p>A resounding wave of support emanates from the crypto community, standing firmly behind Ripple in this legal tussle. Many enthusiasts argue that the SEC&#8217;s pursuit of Ripple represents an overreach of its regulatory authority, potentially stifling innovation in the crypto space. This unwavering backing from the community reflects a broader sentiment that Ripple&#8217;s victory would pave the way for positive <a href="https://zycrypto.com/how-the-outcome-of-sec-v-ripple-case-could-shape-crypto-markets-as-xrp-army-eagerly-awaits-verdict/">industry developments</a>.</p>



<p>Undeniably, the SEC possesses vast resources and a solid determination to secure a favourable outcome in this lawsuit. With their extensive arsenal, they wield considerable power to influence the proceedings. Additionally, the possibility of compelling key witnesses to testify against Ripple looms over the case, potentially posing a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ex-ripple-exec-on-why-sec-might-still-defeat-ripple-in-xrp-lawsuit-amid-unmasking-of-hinman-docs/">threat</a> to Ripple&#8217;s defense.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Verdict Hangs in the Balance</strong></h2>



<p>Ultimately, the fate of Ripple hinges upon the evidence presented by both parties and the rulings of the presiding judge. With the ongoing case, it is premature to predict the victor definitively. However, given the arguments in <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-contemplates-ipo-as-sec-lawsuit-finally-nears-end-will-it-propel-xrp-to-10/">Ripple&#8217;s favor</a>, they appear to have a substantial chance of prevailing. The verdict of this lawsuit will reverberate across the crypto industry, setting a precedent for future regulatory actions.</p>



<p>Ripple&#8217;s case against the SEC rests on several crucial factors, including the contested classification of XRP, their legal team, and the unwavering support of the crypto community. However, the SEC&#8217;s formidable resources and potential key witnesses against Ripple pose significant challenges. Ripple remains <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-army-shower-confidence-on-a-ripple-win-in-sec-case-as-whales-load-up-heavily/">poised for success</a> in this high-stakes legal battle, but only time will reveal the true victor in this momentous clash.</p>

<p>BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-primed-for-trillion-dollar-boost-as-blackrock-expects-landmark-bitcoin-etf-approval/">filed paperwork</a> last week with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the formation of a spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF).</p>



<p>Although the SEC, which oversees ETFs in the United States, has continuously denied all applications for spot bitcoin ETFs, experts say BlackRock’s proposed investment vehicle has a better chance of getting a green light owing to the fund management giant’s strong political connections and its huge success rate with ETF applications.</p>



<p>Hopes surrounding a potential spot Bitcoin ETF by BlackRock sparked a bullish sentiment among Bitcoin investors after the news became public last Thursday. And if there is any truth in the rumours swirling around, then Bitcoin could be on the brink of another bullish boost fuelled by another financial giant. Rumours suggest that U.S.-based financial services firm Fidelity Investments could soon follow in BlackRock’s footsteps and register a spot Bitcoin ETF with the SEC. Fidelity could also bid for Digital Currency Group subsidiary, Grayscale.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Fidelity Next To Attempt To Register Spot Bitcoin ETF In The U.S.?</strong></h2>



<p>For approximately 10 years, crypto company after crypto company has tried its luck with the SEC. Now Wall Street’s heaviest hitters are lending their weight.</p>



<p>In a June 18 <a href="https://twitter.com/AP_Abacus/status/1670455968608538624">tweet</a>, Arch Public co-founder Andrew Parish suggested that Fidelity Investments is readying to take a giant step toward a spot bitcoin ETF, days after BlackRock announced its application. Parish indicated that Fidelity was about to make a “seismic move” in the crypto space.</p>



<p>An ETF is an investment vehicle that tracks the price performance of an underlying asset, such as gold, foreign currencies, or bitcoin. Perhaps most importantly, ETFs mirror the value of an underlying asset without an investor having to buy the asset itself.</p>



<p>Parish also claimed Fidelity could soon acquire Grayscale, the fund manager that is <a href="https://zycrypto.com/grayscale-flips-the-script-and-sues-the-sec-after-spot-bitcoin-etf-plan-rejection/">currently in a legal standoff with the SEC</a> after the securities regulator denied an application to convert its flagship Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an exchange-traded fund.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The question remains, when will the U.S. see its first spot Bitcoin ETF?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Super Bullish For Bitcoin Amid SEC Crackdown</strong></h2>



<p>Notably, BlackRock’s ETF application and the alleged incoming Fidelity filing come at a strange time: The SEC this year has pursued legal recourse against crypto firms such as Kraken, Coinbase, and Binance for what it considers unregistered securities relating to a slew of digital assets listed on the exchanges.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, BlackRock’s and Fidelity’s foray into the bitcoin market can be deemed bullish events that will drive investors’ confidence in the crypto industry. Being the biggest asset manager in the world, a BlackRock-sponsored spot bitcoin ETF would bring an air of legitimacy and that air should generate a heavy inflow of capital. Maybe that would supercharge the price of Bitcoin.</p>



<p>Whether this means the BTC price goes up or down, approval of the BlackRock and Fidelity applications will be a big moment for crypto.</p>
