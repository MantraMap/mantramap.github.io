<p>Over the last six weeks, the cryptocurrency market has been in a consolidation phase leaving investors questioning where the next direction would be for their favorite assets. However, the leading smart contract platform, Ethereum (ETH), has continued to record price declines, losing a major price support level.</p>
<p>The bearish sentiment of Ethereum isn&rsquo;t shared by the likes of Shiba Inu and Tradecurve, which have shown bullish strength recently. But where would their prices go next? In this article, we will discuss the price prediction for these three major cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Shiba Inu Accumulation Spike Amidst Increase in Price</p>
<p>The price of Shiba Inu (SHIB), the Dogecoin competitor, has continued to increase amidst an increase in the accumulation of the meme coin. According to data from IntoTheBlock, the number of Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens held by major whales has increased by 100 billion SHIB since the beginning of the week. The increased accumulation of Shiba Inu (SHIB) follows a price increase over the last two days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trading as low as $0.000008499, the price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) spiked reaching highs of $0.00000875. Market analysts predict that the potential US debt ceiling deal in the coming days will drive the price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) higher. If the debt ceiling is increased, the price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) could trade between $0.0000100 and $0.00001750. However, the ever-optimistic Shiba Army has predicted prices of up to $1.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ethereum Price Drops Further &ndash; What&rsquo;s Next for the Leading Altcoin?</p>
<p>Ethereum (ETH), the leading smart contracts platform has continued to sustain price declines. From highs of $1,920 this week, the price of Ethereum (ETH) dropped as low as $1,850. However, there has been a resurgence in the price of Ethereum over the last few days, as the leading altcoin now trades at $1,880 at the time of this writing.</p>
<p>Although most signals point towards a bearish sentiment, there are hopes that the upcoming debt ceiling increase could turn the tide for Ethereum (ETH). However, in the short term, Ethereum will need to break above the $1,920 level to mark a bullish reversal. But If the price of Ethereum (ETH) falls below $1,850, it could be a free fall.</p>

<p>Tradecurve Predicted to Record 100X Price Increase in 2023</p>
<p>Unlike Ethereum, Tradecurve has been more bullish than bearish over the last few weeks. The price of Tradecurve jumped by 25% as it entered its third presale phase, but market analysts believe there could be more increases to come. Tradecurve will be an all-inclusive trading platform, allowing users from anywhere in the world to open an account without the need for KYC requirements.</p>
<p>The bullish sentiment investors and industry experts have about Tradecurve stems from it being the first decentralized trading platform built on a blockchain that will allow users to access the global financial markets including stocks, options, CMDs, forex, and ETFs all from one account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tapping into the $632 trillion over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market and the forex market with a global turnover of $7.5 trillion per day is bound to yield rewards for Tradecurve. Experts believe that this gives TCRV the opportunity to jump by 100x. You can join the growing number of investors buying into the Tradecurve presale as a token now sells for $0.015 before the price jump.</p>
