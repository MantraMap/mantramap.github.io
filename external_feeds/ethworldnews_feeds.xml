<ul><li>The Securities and Exchange Commission has subpoenaed Bitcoin mining firm Marathon Digital.&nbsp;</li><li>The subpoena is in relation to an investigation into Marathon’s data center in Montana, U.S.</li><li>The SEC previously subpoenaed the Montana-based facility to get access to its documents and communications.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-cease-desist-coinme-4-million-fine/">SEC</a>) reportedly subpoenaed Nevada-based Bitcoin mining firm Marathon Digital Holdings last month. The securities regulator issued the subpoena to the second-largest publicly traded Bitcoin miner in the United States in relation to several matters including transactions between Marathon and its affiliated entities. </p>



<h2><strong>Marathon Digital’s Montana Data Center Under Scrutiny</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-10/bitcoin-miner-marathon-receives-another-subpoena-from-sec" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, Marathon Digital received the subpoena from the SEC on April 10, 2023. The subpoena was in relation to the Bitcoin mining giant’s data center facility based in Hardin, Montana. Marathon said in a statement that the federal regulator’s investigation may be to determine if the Bitcoin miner may have violated federal securities law.  The company is reportedly cooperating with the SEC in this matter. </p>



<p>The latest move from the Securities and Exchange comes more than two years after Marathon Digital received a similar subpoena on September 30, 2021, by way of which the SEC sought to gain access to the bitcoin miner’s internal documents and communications concerning the Hardin, Montana-based data center facility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Earlier today, Marathon Digital released the company’s <a href="https://ir.marathondh.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1313/marathon-digital-holdings-reports-first-quarter-2023-results" rel="nofollow noopener">financial reports</a> for the quarter ending March 31, 2023. The first quarter of the year saw the Bitcoin miner shrink its net loss to $7.2 million as compared to a net loss of $23 in Q1, 2022. The company’s latest loss per share came in at $0.05, a massive reduction from the $0.12 in the first quarter of last year. </p>



<p>As for BTC revenues, Marathon recorded gains on the sale of bitcoin of $17.6 million in the quarter in line with the previously reported plan of selling bitcoin to fund operating costs. At the time of writing, Marathon Digital’s share price was changing hands at $10.22, up nearly 9% over the past 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Abu Dhabi&#8217;s Royal Group plans to deploy more capital into the crypto industry and commodities, Bloomberg reported citing people familiar with the matter.</li><li>The investment firm led by United Arab Emirates National Security Adviser Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan has poured billions into a short position on US stock on the back of recession concerns.</li><li>Royal Group&#8217;s portfolio shift follows the UAE&#8217;s crypto hub plans and regulatory discussions with entities like Coinbase.</li></ul>



<p>Royal Group, an investment firm led by top a UAE royal, shifted its billion-dollar portfolio toward cryptocurrencies and commodities after accumulating a massive short position in U.S. stocks. </p>



<p>The change in investment strategy comes as Royal Group harbors concerns over a possible recession in America&#8217;s economy, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-10/uae-s-royal-group-shorts-us-stocks-on-global-recession-fears?leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-10/uae-s-royal-group-shorts-us-stocks-on-global-recession-fears?leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reported</a> citing individuals familiar with the matter. </p>



<p>America&#8217;s looming recession seems to have dampened the group&#8217;s faith in equities, leading to a big bet against the U.S. economy. This has in turn strengthened the prospect of digital assets and commodities as Abu Dhabi&#8217;s top investment firm plans to deploy more cash in the nascent industry. </p>



<h2>The UAE&#8217;s Crypto Hub Plans </h2>



<p>Digital asset investment plans from Abu Dhabi&#8217;s richest investment venture align with the UAE&#8217;s plans for a global digital asset hub. The United Arab Emirates Prime Minister announced strategic moves towards encouraging crypto businesses and standardizing the industry. </p>



<p>Emirates like Abu Dhabi and Dubai are arguably at the forefront of this campaign. Dubai was one of the first jurisdictions in the world to open a regulatory agency dedicated to crypto rule-making and oversight. </p>



<p>Dubai&#8217;s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) also published a rule book introducing a licensing regime and framework for digital asset service providers, one of the first of its kind. </p>



<p>Entities like Binance and Crypto Dot Com have received provisional permission to set up shop in one of the Emirates. Recently, <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-engage-uae-lawmakers/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-engage-uae-lawmakers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase and its CEO Brian Armstrong</a> flew to meet with policymakers amid an exodus in the U.S. thanks to stiffling enforcement action and unclear crypto rules. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Three Arrows Capital (3AC) co-founder Su Zhu was granted a restraining order from a Singapore court against BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes.</li><li>Hayes claimed that Zhu and his co-founder Kyle Davies owe $6 million after their crypto hedge fund 3AC crashed in the summer of last year.</li><li>Zhu, Davies, and Hayes have been wrapped up in controversy after marquee business collapses and a guilty plea to federal charges.</li></ul>



<p>Three crypto juggernauts spar in a 2 v 1 social media debt match after a massive hedge fund crashed last summer and a plea deal following loose AML checks at a major exchange. </p>



<p>Co-founder of the BitMEX trading Arthur Hayes has been <a href="https://tokeninsight.com/en/news/3ac-co-founder-zhu-su-obtains-restraining-order-against-arthur-hayes-in-singapore" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://tokeninsight.com/en/news/3ac-co-founder-zhu-su-obtains-restraining-order-against-arthur-hayes-in-singapore" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">served</a> by a Singapore court following a public spat with Su Zhu and Kyle Davies, co-founders of bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital otherwise known as 3AC. </p>



<p>Hayes has poked at the pair on Twitter since 3AC crashed last year. After Zhu and Davies resurfaced for a Bloomberg interview months after their company collapsed, Hayes laid into them for their rhetoric regarding fraud allegations and corporate malpractice. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>The court order issued on behalf of Zhu bars Hayes from communicating with him or his co-founder Davies &#8220;by any means&#8221;. Hayes cannot publish any messages that threaten, abuse, or insult 3AC&#8217;s former executives, per Harassment Court Judge Sandra Looi Ai Lin&#8217;s restraining order. </p>



<p>In April, Hayes demanded his &#8220;f****** money&#8221; after pointing to &#8220;big money&#8221; raised by Zhu and Davies from the Bahrain Sovereign Wealth Fund. The money mentioned is $6 million that Hayes says the Three Arrows founders owe him. </p>

<h2>Hayes Trolls 3AC Execs From Home Detention, OPNX Launches</h2>



<p>Hayes&#8217; 2022 was not absent of controversy on the back of federal prosecution for loose anti-money laundering (AML) checks at BitMEX. In February 2022, Hayes pleaded guilty to the charges and was served six months of home arrest instead of a prison sentence. </p>



<p>It was during this home detention that 3AC collapsed and Hayes began a barrage of social media posts trolling Zhu, Davies, and their hedge fund. </p>



<p>Zhu and Davies also started a new crypto venture in <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/dubai-vara-blasts-3ac-opnx/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/dubai-vara-blasts-3ac-opnx/" rel="noreferrer noopener">OPNX</a> despite leading 3AC into a hole $1 billion deep at least. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>A trader splurged almost $1 million buying Bitcoin Inscription #5232025 amid growing debates about congestion on the BTC network.</li><li>This particular BTC Inscription holds 50,000 ORDI coins, the native asset of Ordinals Protocol which was created by developer Casey Rodarmor.</li><li>ORDI was introduced earlier this year using the BRC-20 standard after developer Rodarmor designed a protocol for embedding digital data like art on every satoshi and pseudonymous builder Domo unveiled a token format akin to ERC-20 on Ethereum.</li></ul>



<p>A trader spent 35 BTC buying Bitcoin Inscription #5232025 amid growing debates about congestion on the BTC network due to BRC-20 memecoins and a surge in text-based NFTs issued on crypto&#8217;s largest blockchain.</p>



<p>This particular BTC Inscription holds 50,000 ORDI coins, the native asset of Ordinals Protocol which was created by developer Casey Rodarmor.</p>



<p>The scoop <a href="https://twitter.com/DegenerateNews/status/1656212409835716608?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/DegenerateNews/status/1656212409835716608?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">cost</a> over $960,000 in Bitcoin at current market prices, possibly the highest sale for an Inscription since the asset debuted earlier in January 2023. Since then over 5 million inscriptions have been minted on Bitcoin&#8217;s blockchain, a surge that BTC purists claim has drastically congested the network. </p>



<p>Dune Analytics data showed that over 4 million of these Bitcoin Inscriptions are text-based. Less than half a million contain visual digital data in png format or what some might consider NFT art. These Inscriptions are made possible by using the Ordinals ProtocoL developed and launched by Casey Rodarmor. </p>



<p>Ordinals as they are commonly called by crypto participants have also racked up a fortune in fees. Users have spent over $29 million in fees experimenting with ordinals and attaching data to satoshi, the smallest unit of Bitcoin. </p>

<h2>Average Fees Skyrocket On Bitcoin Inscription Activity </h2>



<p>The rise of Ordinals and a token standard akin to ERC-20 on Ethereum seems to have sparked a <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bitcoin-fees-2-year-high-as-brc-20/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bitcoin-fees-2-year-high-as-brc-20/" rel="noreferrer noopener">tussle</a> over block space on Bitcoin&#8217;s network. Indeed, the increased demand on BTC&#8217;s blockchain led to an uptick in transaction fees. Fees on BTC hit over $20 on average, a two-year high per on-chain data. </p>



<p>Rising average fees and a flood of BRC-20 tokens have formed a crescendo around arguments for and against ordinals. On one side, BTC bulls like Michael Saylor &#8211; whose company holds billions in Bitcoin &#8211; insist that Ordinals could serve as a &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/w1PRsS4SyUc?feature=share" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/live/w1PRsS4SyUc?feature=share" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">catalyst</a>&#8221; for adoption. </p>



<p>BTC purists and some developers oppose the view, moving to sink NFTs and altcoins on BTC&#8217;s network. </p>

<p>Popular market-making firms Jane Street Group and Jump Trading are significantly scaling down their crypto trading activities in the United States. The top market makers are reportedly retreating from the American crypto market in light of the crackdown on the crypto industry by regulators in the country.</p>



<h2><strong>Jane Street Plans To Scale Back Crypto Operations Globally</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-09/jane-street-jump-pull-back-crypto-trading-amid-us-crackdown?leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, the hostile stance of regulators against crypto firms in the United States has prompted Jane Street and Jump Crypto to pull back from the country. A person familiar with the matter revealed that Jane Street is planning to go one step further and scale back its crypto operations around the world. The regulatory uncertainty around crypto has reportedly made it difficult for the company to comply with internal standards. </p>



<p>As for Jump Trading’s digital asset-facing unit Jump Crypto, the retreat from crypto will be limited to the United States. Two people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg that the market-making firm is planning to expand its international crypto trading operations. Both firms are reportedly still involved in market-making for crypto but on a smaller scale. The market makers have declined to comment on the report.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The crackdown campaign on crypto renewed at the beginning of 2023 with multiple federal agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), initiating enforcement actions against crypto firms. Both market makers were named in a probe launched by the U.S. Department of Justice in March 2023 to investigate the collapse of Terra last year. Jane Street also made an appearance in a civil enforcement action brought by the CFTC against <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/jane-street-binance-vip-in-cftc-lawsuit/">Binance</a> last month. </p>

<p>Digital Currency Group, the digital conglomerate behind crypto heavyweights like GBTC issuer Grayscale Investments, appears to be on the path to default on a half-a-billion-dollar loan owed to its bankrupt subsidiary Genesis. The loan is part of an approximately $1.7 billion exposure that Genesis has to DCG, which consists of a loan and a promissory note.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Digital Currency Group Is Looking To Raise Capital</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bankruptcy-law/barry-silberts-digital-currency-group-seeks-to-refinance-debt" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, the Digital Currency Group, led by crypto entrepreneur Barry Silbert, is seeking to refinance the debt owed to Genesis, which is made up of a $630 million loan and a $1.1 billion promissory note. While the promissory note is due in June 2023, the $630 million loan is set to mature this week, between May 9 and 11 to be precise. </p>



<p>Genesis is currently undergoing a restructuring process as part of its Chapter 11 proceedings. Last week Genesis agreed to enter a 30-day <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/gemini-genesis-agree-on-mediation-process/">mediation period</a> with DCG, Gemini, and its Unsecured Creditors Committee, in order to fast-track the resolution and work out repayment. Gemini and its UCC have a vested interest in DCG’s repayment to Genesis since it will pave the way for allowing its creditors to be made whole. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We are committed to reaching a fair outcome for all and look forward to a productive resolution during this mediation period.”</p><cite>Digital Currency Group</cite></blockquote>



<p>The Digital Currency Group has stated that it is in talks with investors to raise additional capital to further its growth. The extra capital will also provide financial flexibility with regard to the outstanding obligation to Genesis. However, in the meantime, the crypto conglomerate seeks to refinance the loans owed to its subsidiary. As for the $630 million loan that matures this week, it is safe to assume that it will not be paid back to Genesis.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Ishan Wahi, a former product manager at Coinbase, has been sentenced to two years in prison.&nbsp;</li><li>A federal judge handed Wahi the sentence for his role in an insider trading scheme involving crypto tokens.&nbsp;</li><li>Wahi’s brother was sentenced to ten months last year on wire fraud conspiracy charges in the same matter.</li></ul>



<p>Ishan Wahi, the former product manager at Coinbase, has been handed a 24-month prison sentence by a federal court in New York for his role in one of the first insider trading cases in the crypto industry. Wahi’s sentencing comes almost ten months after he was arrested and charged by the U.S. Department of Justice, as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>The Ex-Coinbase Employee Will Likely Be Deported</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-09/ex-coinbase-manager-ishan-wahi-gets-2-years-for-insider-trading?in_source=embedded-checkout-banner&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, Judge Loretta Preska of the Manhattan Federal Court handed Ishan Wahi a two-year sentence in federal prison for perpetrating an insider trading scheme with crypto tokens. The Judge highlighted a “massive abuse” of Coinbase’s trust on Wahi’s part during the 10-month period where he used confidential information to purchase tokens that were scheduled to be listed on the crypto exchange, making $1.5 million in the process. The judge noted that it was not a one-time event. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>I’m very sorry for my actions. My position in the company gave me access to confidential information. I knew it was wrong.”</p><cite>Ishan Wahi in court today</cite></blockquote>



<p>Wahi’s sentencing comes nearly three months after he pled guilty earlier this year to two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. He initially entered a non-guilty plea to the charges brought by the Justice Department in July last year. In parallel action, the SEC charged Wahi and his associates including his brother Nikhil Wahi, with violating the antifraud provisions of the securities laws at the time. Nikhil Wahi pled guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in September 2022. He was sentenced to 10 months in prison in January this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ishan Wahi has been ordered to surrender by June 21, 2023, to begin serving his sentence at the Fort Dix Federal Correctional Institution in New Jersey. His sentence will be followed by two years of supervised release. As per Bloomberg, the former Coinbase product manager will likely be deported to India. Wahi’s sentencing comes less than a week after an <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ex-opensea-exec-guilty-insider-trading/">OpenSea</a> executive was convicted by a federal grand jury in New York in what was described as the first case of insider trading in the crypto industry.</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Wallets controlled by Alameda Research received millions of Tether&#8217;s stablecoin USDT and MASK tokens from OKX on Tuesday.</li><li>The wallets in question are in full control of the FTX Bankruptcy Estate that took over November&#8217;s crash.</li><li>FTX&#8217;s meteoritic crash grew into a legal saga with criminal charges and multi-million bail bonds as federal prosecutors argue one of America&#8217;s biggest fraud cases.</li></ul>



<p>Wallets controlled by Alameda Research received millions of Tether&#8217;s stablecoin USDT and MASK tokens from OKX on Tuesday. Alameda wallets saw $57 million in USDT inflows coupled with $300,000 worth of Mask tokens, per on-chain data cited by <a href="https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1655885122946867200?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1655885122946867200?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Peckshield</a>. </p>



<p>The wallets in question are completely controlled by the FTX Bankruptcy Estate, led by bankruptcy CEO John Ray III who took over after November&#8217;s crash, and holds over $240 million in cryptocurrencies. </p>



<h2>Missing Funds From FTX/Alameda&#8217;s Empire</h2>



<p>Shortly after the collapse of FTX, a hacker <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-hacker-tips-launder-400-million-loot/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-hacker-tips-launder-400-million-loot/" rel="noreferrer noopener">looted</a> nearly $600 million from its wallets fueling fears that FTX accounts on other exchanges were compromised. This led to the investigations carried out by crypto exchanges and trading venues to protect users and restore trust. </p>



<p>OKX, one of the biggest centralized crypto exchanges by trading volume, and a leading Web3 technology company, recently announced that it conducted investigations to identify any FTX-related transactions on its exchange. The platform froze $157 million in digital assets belonging to FTX and its sister company Alameda Research before turning over the assets to the Bankruptcy Estate.</p>



<p>OKX has now returned over $210 million to the failed crypto exchange and its affiliates. </p>



<p>The FTX Bankruptcy Estate continues to hunt down missing funds and consolidate accounts managed by Sam Bankman-Fried and his associates. </p>



<h2>Criminal Charges</h2>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of FTX and Alameda Research, stares down the barrel of America&#8217;s biggest fraud case. &#8220;Not guilty&#8221; SBF pleaded to all 13 criminal charges even as his colleagues like former Alameda CEO Caroline Elisson and former FTX Engineering Chief Nishad Singh <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/former-ftx-nishad-singh-pleads-guilty/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/former-ftx-nishad-singh-pleads-guilty/" rel="noreferrer noopener">negotiate</a> plea deals with prosecutors. </p>



<p>Bankman-Fried&#8217;s lawyers moved to throw out the case, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/09/indicted-ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried-urges-court-to-toss-charges.html" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/09/indicted-ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried-urges-court-to-toss-charges.html" rel="noreferrer noopener">arguing</a> to the court that charges should be civil and not criminal. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Rather than wait for traditional civil and regulatory processes following their ordinary course to address the situation, the Government jumped in with both feet, improperly seeking to turn these civil and regulatory issues into federal crimes.</p></blockquote>

<p>Bittrex Inc. has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the state of Delaware. The Seattle-based crypto exchange’s bankruptcy filing comes less than a month after it was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The exchange announced last month that it was winding down operations in the United States in light of the deteriorating regulatory landscape.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Bittrex Owes $25 Million To Treasury Department’s OFAC</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-08/crypto-platform-bittrex-files-chapter-11-bankruptcy-in-delaware?leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, Bittrex’s Chapter 11 filing listed assets and liabilities reaching up to $1 billion each. Court papers viewed by Bloomberg revealed that the crypto exchange’s affiliated entities including Desolation Holdings LLC, Bittrex Malta Holdings Ltd., and Bittrex Malta Ltd also filed for bankruptcy.  The exchange has clarified that the operations of Bittrex Global will not be impacted by its American entity&#8217;s bankruptcy. As for customer assets, the exchange assured its users that their funds are safe and secure on the platform. </p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>This announcement does not impact Bittrex Global, which will continue operations as normal for its customers outside the U.S.&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p>Ironically, the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is listed as the bankrupt exchange’s largest non-insider creditor. Bittrex owed a whopping $25 million to OFAC as part of a settlement both parties reached in October last year. OFAC imposed the multi-million fine on the crypto exchange over alleged violations of multiple sanctions programs as well as the Bank Secrecy Act’s (BSA’s) anti-money laundering (AML) and suspicious activity report (SAR) reporting requirements. At the time, the enforcement action on the exchange was OFAC’s largest ever. </p>



<p>Bittrex’s bankruptcy filing comes less than a month after it was <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-sues-bittrex-violation-federal-laws/">sued</a> by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over alleged violations of federal laws. The securities regulator charged the exchange and its former CEO Bill Shihara, with operating an unregistered national securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency. The regulator also charges its foreign affiliate with failing to register as a national securities exchange in connection with its operation of a single shared order book along with the American entity.</p>

<ul><li>Paxful has announced the resumption of operations after being suspended for over a month.&nbsp;</li><li>The P2P crypto platform suspended operations last month following the departure of key staff members.&nbsp;</li><li>The Paxful wallet remained active throughout the platform’s suspension period.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Paxful has announced that it is resuming operations after being offline for more than a month. The P2P bitcoin exchange shut down operations last month following the departure of key staff members and increasing scrutiny from regulators in the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Conflict Among Paxful’s Top Management </strong>Continues</h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://paxful.com/sign-up-transition" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a> from Paxful earlier today, the peer-to-peer Bitcoin marketplace is now back online. Over the next two days, the platform will gradually restore functionality to the marketplace. The platform took to Twitter earlier today to inform its community that it is back and is “better than ever”. Its staff has reportedly been working for the past month to bring the marketplace back online without compromising the safety and security of users. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We know it has been a difficult time for many of our users, who were understandably surprised by the sudden suspension, however, we are delighted to be back so that we can continue to serve millions of people without financial access.”</p></blockquote>



<p>News of the resumption of services comes as a positive development for its users. The exchange <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/paxful-shutting-down-amid-regulatory-challanges/">suspended </a>operations on April 4, 2023, amid growing scrutiny by American regulators and the departure of the company’s key staff members including Paxful co-founder Artur Schabeck. Paxful Wallet remained fully operational throughout the suspension period. Its users were also offered multiple P2P crypto avenues to continue trading. </p>



<p>Schabeck told <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/05/08/paxful-marketplace-back-online-following-temporary-suspension/" rel="nofollow noopener">CoinDesk </a>earlier today that he is actively looking for a settlement with Paxful in relation to the wrongful termination lawsuit he filed following his departure from the firm. The former executive further revealed that the P2P firm is owned by a custodian who serves as one of the company’s three directors. The third board member plays an instrumental role, given his power to act as a tiebreaker in a conflict involving the other founders.</p>
