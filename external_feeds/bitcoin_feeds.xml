The software also has a feature facilitating the monitoring of crypto asset transactions, the department told Russian media.</strong></p>
<h2>Russian Police Brag About New Crypto Tracing Tool on Eve of Anti-Corruption Day</h2>
<p>Employees of MVD, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, now have access to a specialized digital platform called “Personal account of a law enforcement agency,” Tass reported. The ministry revealed to the news agency that it’s identifying owners of cryptocurrency wallets using the new system.</p>
<p>“This digital project has already been implemented and is successfully operating,” the head of MVD’s Main Department of Economic Security and Anti-Corruption, Police Lieutenant General Andrey Kurnosenko, told Tass on the eve of the International Anti-Corruption Day, celebrated on Dec. 9 to raise public awareness for efforts to combat corruption.</p>
<p>Kurnosenko explained that the analytical tool allows his colleagues to quickly receive and evaluate collected information about specific financial risks for the Russian economy and also compile the results of joint work within national projects in the field of fighting cybercrime and other fields.</p>

<p>The high-ranking MVD official also highlighted that the integrated product features a module developed to help investigators monitor cryptocurrency transactions. “There is already a positive experience of using this tool to identify unscrupulous owners of crypto wallets,” the general pointed out, without elaborating further.</p>
<p>The announcement of MVD’s new crypto tracing capabilities comes after in April the Ministry of Finance accepted for review a number of proposals <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russian-law-enforcement-submits-proposals-to-regulate-seizure-of-crypto-assets-data-sharing/">submitted</a> by the country’s law enforcement agencies as part of a push to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/amendments-to-russias-digital-asset-law-aim-to-allow-mining-ban-crypto-exchange-and-ads/">regulate</a> Russia’s crypto space. One of the areas addressed was the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/alleged-hydra-administrator-refuses-to-provide-access-to-his-crypto-wallet-report-claims/">seizure</a> of digital assets and the reporting of crypto transaction data.</p>
<p>News that authorities in Russia are <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russia-developing-ai-system-monitor-cryptocurrency-transactions/">developing</a> a platform to track and analyze transactions involving cryptocurrencies came out two years ago. At the time, in August 2020, the prototype of the system, reportedly employing artificial intelligence technology, was undergoing tests.</p>

On Dec. 9, 2022, the exchange Crypto.com published proof-of-reserves records and the verification was also conducted by Mazars.</strong></p>
<h2>Binance and Crypto.com Reveal POR Audits</h2>
<p>Two very large crypto exchanges provided proof-of-reserves (POR) documentation this week following the promises made by exchange executives after the FTX fiasco. The world&#x2019;s largest crypto exchange, in terms of trade volume, Binance, <a href="https://veritas.mazars.com/binance/">revealed</a> a comprehensive look at assets like <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, BTCB, and BBTC hosted on Mazars Group&#x2019;s website that shows assets held on Bitcoin, Ethereum, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a>, and Binance Smart Chain networks.</p>
<p>The audit by Mazars took place on Nov. 22, 2022, at Bitcoin block height 764,327, and the report claims assets are backed 101% by collateralized reserves. &#x201C;At the time of assessment, Mazars observed Binance controlled in-scope assets in excess of 100% of their total platform liabilities,&#x201D; the Mazars report asserts. &#x201C;The collateralization ratio takes into account in-scope-assets lent through the margin and loans service offering which are collateralized by out-of-scope assets. The Merkle Root was compiled by hashing all client accounts into a single output,&#x201D; the Mazars audit adds.</p>
<p>Mazars&#x2019; audit on Binance further notes that &#x201C;total liabilities&#x201D; was accounted for in the attestation. At the end of Nov. 2022, after Binance <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-publishes-its-proof-of-reserves-system-for-bitcoin-holdings-additional-assets-coming-soon/">provided POR addresses</a>, Kraken&#x2019;s Jesse Powell <a href="https://twitter.com/jespow/status/1596227031637045248?s=20&t=zWVhWf7oKMuMfpYplr7qRg">criticized</a> the proof and said that the &#x201C;statement of assets is pointless without liabilities.&#x201D; Powell has shared his two cents about the latest audit from Binance as well and <a href="https://twitter.com/jespow/status/1600787933065117696?s=20&t=tKz4ziLUnQXfK8Ml6ZoQcw">lambasted</a> the Binance POR again on Dec. 8.</p>
<p>Following Binance releasing its POR audit reviewed by Mazars Group, the crypto trading platform Crypto.com published a press release <a href="https://crypto.com/company-news/crypto-com-releases-proof-of-reserves">announcement</a> about its POR audit which was also conducted by Mazars. &#x201C;Mazars Group compared the assets held in [onchain] addresses proven to be controlled by Crypto.com with customer balances through an auditor-overseen live query of a production database as of December 7, 2022, 00:00:00 UTC,&#x201D; the company said.</p>

<p>Crypto.com detailed that existing customers can <a href="https://crypto.com/us/proof-of-reserves">verify their assets</a> on the platform. The full Crypto.com audit conducted by Mazars can be found <a href="https://crypto.com/document/proof-of-reserves">here</a>. &#x201C;Our report is solely for the purposes of offering Crypto.com&#x2019;s customers additional transparency and reassurance that their in-scope assets are fully reserved, exist on the blockchain(s), and are under the control of Crypto.com at the below mentioned reporting date,&#x201D; the Mazars audit details.</p>

According to the report, sources say The Block executive Michael McCaffrey received $16 million in one payment and used the funds to purchase an apartment in the Bahamas.</strong></p>
<h2>The Block CEO Received 3 Payments of $43 Million From Alameda Research, One Payment Used to Purchase an Apartment in the Bahamas</h2>
<p>The Twitter community has been discussing a new revelation that is tied to the disgraced FTX co-founder <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/from-a-32-billion-valuation-to-financial-troubles-an-in-depth-look-at-the-rise-and-fall-of-ftx/">Sam Bankman-Fried</a> (SBF) and his quantitive trading firm Alameda Research. Reportedly, The Block was funded by Alameda for more than a year, and “one $16 million batch of funding” went toward an apartment in the Bahamas.</p>
<p>The news was reported on by the Axios reporter Sara Fischer on Dec. 9, 2022, and the reporter noted that The Block employees got wind of the situation just before the exclusive <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/12/09/bankman-fried-funded-crypto-news-site-block">report</a> was published.</p>

<p>Axios noted that The Block&#8217;s chief revenue officer, Bobby Moran, will take over the CEO role as Fischer said “McCaffrey has resigned as CEO and is leaving the company.” Moran plans to restructure The Block, and attempt to “buy out McCaffrey&#8217;s stake in the company.” The news was confirmed by a number of The Block’s employees on Friday via Twitter.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m absolutely gutted by this news, which was briefed to the company this afternoon,” The Block’s Frank Chaparro <a href="https://twitter.com/fintechfrank/status/1601295493102911488?s=20&amp;t=wMQW8YpE0Me3DvkIGMcqyA">tweeted</a>. “Underpinning my shock are feelings of utter disgust and betrayal by Mike’s actions, greed, lack of disclosure. He&#8217;s literal scum. He kept every single one of us in the dark.”</p>
<p>The former CEO of the media company, Mike Dudas, tweeted that the news was “Horrifying.” “[I am] devastated beyond belief,” Dudas <a href="https://twitter.com/mdudas/status/1601294296019132419?s=20&amp;t=VRdvLscjHzQiU9wHvbLUSg">said</a>. “I was given less than an hour’s heads up by the CEO of The Block. If you think you’re shocked, I’m literally lost right now.”</p>
<p>The Block’s VP of research Larry Cermak also <a href="https://twitter.com/lawmaster/status/1601296092632477696?s=20&amp;t=XwJaoI_YpeIV4huuJoKQ1Q">tweeted</a> about the situation. “Last few months really can’t get much worse,” Cermak wrote. “Got f***ed by FTX (after naively trusting them like a complete idiot) and now also got f***ed by the CEO. Just like everyone else at The Block, I just found out about this,” the researcher added.</p>
<h2>The Block Reports on Firm&#8217;s CEO, Story Follows Alleged Circle of Coindesk Buyers</h2>
<p>The Block also published an article about the story which cites a statement made by Bobby Moran. “No one at The Block had any knowledge of this financial arrangement besides Mike,” Moran explained in a <a href="https://medium.com/the-block-crypto/ceo-transition-e2700caed741">statement</a>.</p>
<p>“From our own experience,&#8221; Moran added. &#8220;We have seen no evidence that Mike ever sought to improperly influence the newsroom or research teams, particularly in their coverage of SBF, FTX and Alameda Research.” According to The Block’s own data, McCaffrey received three loans which added up to roughly $43 million.</p>
<p>The news concerning The Block’s funding follows the <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/11/29/2022/online-news-site-coindesk-attracts-suitors-amid-crypto-crash">report</a> published by Semafor that explained the crypto news publication Coindesk received takeover solicitations from a number of investors. Interestingly, Coindesk published a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/11/02/divisions-in-sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-empire-blur-on-his-trading-titan-alamedas-balance-sheet/">report</a> that had been cited by many (including Wikipedia) as one of the fires that lit the FTX bonfire.</p>

<p>The FTX contagion hurt a number of associated businesses and Coindesk’s parent firm Digital Currency Group (DCG) was indirectly <a href="https://www.mollywhite.net/etc/ftx-contagion">exposed to the blowout</a>. Semafor’s Bradley Saacks and Liz Hoffman cited the FTX contagion spread to DCG and quoted DCG’s founder Barry Silbert in the article. In addition, Semafor itself <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/semafor">was funded</a> by FTX co-founder SBF, and Tesla’s Elon Musk <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/elon-musk-slams-semafors-journalistic-integrity-tesla-exec-says-semafor-is-owned-by-ftx-co-founder-sam-bankman-fried/">recently slammed</a> Semafor’s journalistic integrity over the funding from the disgraced crypto CEO.</p>

It&#x2019;s been suggested that the Shanghai hard fork will be able to manage the network&#x2019;s staked ethereum withdrawals. </strong></p>
<h2>Ethereum Devs Aim for Hard Fork Target &#x2018;Around March-ish&#x2019;</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Dec. 8, 2022, Ethereum Core developers </span><a href="https://youtu.be/y8jZ11_CQGo"><span style="font-weight: 400;">convened</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the 151st developers meeting, and a number of subjects were discussed including Ethereum&#x2019;s next hard fork. Ethereum&#x2019;s last major hard fork was The Merge, a significant change to the rules of the blockchain network which made the network change from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS). A hard fork&#x2019;s change is backwards-incompatible, which means network users are required to update their node software. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the meeting, developers explained that the next hard fork, called Shanghai, may get scheduled for sometime around March 2023. Shanghai also may address the network&#x2019;s staked ethereum withdrawals as the community has established importance on the matter. At the time of writing, on Dec. 9, 2022, the </span><a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000219ab540356cbb839cbe05303d7705fa"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beacon Chain contract</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has 15,597,175 ether locked into the contract that&#x2019;s worth roughly $19.88 billion using <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> exchange rates today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has been known for a long time now that the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> is locked into the Beacon Chain contract and it will require a hard fork to access the funds and possibly more than one. Ethereum Core developer Tim Beiko acknowledged that most people and devs wanted withdrawals to take place quickly. &#x201C;This is clearly the highest priority for everybody,&#x201D; Beiko remarked. &#x201C;People seem to generally want a target around March-ish,&#x201D; Beiko added. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developers have also been discussing how to improve Ethereum&#x2019;s throughput capacity and Ethereum&#x2019;s software programmers have introduced the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844. EIP-4844 deals with concepts like </span><a href="https://www.eip4844.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proto-danksharding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shard blob transactions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Both of these concepts leverage technology that&#x2019;s meant to implement a &#x201C;new kind of transaction type to Ethereum which accepts &#x2018;blobs&#x2019; of data to be persisted in the beacon node for a short period of time.&#x201D;</span></p>

The company&#x2019;s blog post specifically mentions switching the stablecoin asset tether over to usd coin, and the firm is offering &#x201C;zero fees&#x201D; to swap these two tokens.</strong></p>
<h2>Coinbase Offers Users Zero Fees to Switch From Tether to Usd Coin, Crypto Community Questions Motive</h2>
<p>On Thursday, Dec. 8, 2022, Coinbase shared a new blog post and <a href="https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/1600997059770736641">tweeted</a> the statement: &#x201C;Switch to a trusted stablecoin: usd coin (USDC). Now convert tether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a>) to USDC with zero fees.&#x201D; The company&#x2019;s <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/switch-to-the-trusted-and-reputable-digital-dollar-usdc">blog post</a> goes into more detail as it notes that customers can swap tether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a>) for usd coin (USDC) &#x201C;with zero fees.&#x201D; The blog post notes that events that have taken place during the last few weeks have shaken the crypto industry&#x2019;s trust.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The events of the past few weeks have put some stablecoins to the test and we&#x2019;ve seen a flight to safety,&#x201D; Coinbase&#x2019;s blog post explains. &#x201C;We believe that [usd coin] (USDC) is a trusted and reputable stablecoin, so we&#x2019;re making it more frictionless to switch: starting today we&#x2019;re waiving fees for global retail customers to convert <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a> to USDC.&#x201D;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-563278 size-full" title="Coinbase Entices Users to Switch From USDT to USDC, Crypto Firm Says Recent Events 'Put Some Stablecoins to the Test'" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/dec8.jpg" alt="Coinbase Entices Users to Switch From USDT to USDC, Crypto Firm Says Recent Events 'Put Some Stablecoins to the Test'" width="1280" height="900" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/dec8-300x211.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/dec8-1024x720.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/dec8-768x540.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/dec8.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>Coinbase&#x2019;s statements gave crypto proponents the perception that the blog post was indirectly questioning Tether&#x2019;s stablecoin, the current largest stablecoin asset by market cap today. &#x201C;Shots fired. Bang bang,&#x201D; the Twitter account known as Autism Capital <a href="https://twitter.com/AutismCapital/status/1601045444020535297?s=20&t=zaXLuX5FLcsGdBOzwK2Jew">replied</a> to Coinbase&#x2019;s tweet about the subject. A number of other crypto supporters disagreed with Coinbase&#x2019;s statements. The strategy advisor at Vaneck, Gabor Gurbacs, opined that it was more likely people would choose <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a>.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Tether was the first stablecoin in the world and has been trusted by millions around the world since its inception,&#x201D; Gurbacs <a href="https://twitter.com/gaborgurbacs/status/1601020841135071233?s=20&t=zaXLuX5FLcsGdBOzwK2Jew">said</a> in a response to Coinbase&#x2019;s tweet on Thursday. &#x201C;In fact if you ask people outside a narrow group in the U.S. they&#x2019;d pick tether over USDC,&#x201D; Gurbacs added.</p>
<p class="p1"></p>
<p>The Twitter account known as the Byzantine General <a href="https://twitter.com/ByzGeneral/status/1601022831118389248?s=20&t=zaXLuX5FLcsGdBOzwK2Jew">wrote</a>: &#x201C;Not a good look. Also looks desperate. Makes me trust USDC a little less.&#x201D; The operators of the decentralized finance (defi) platform Curve Finance found a humorous silver lining in the situation when the defi platform&#x2019;s Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/CurveFinance/status/1601016335676608512?s=20&t=zaXLuX5FLcsGdBOzwK2Jew">tweeted</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yes, let&#x2019;s shift back and forth really often. Loving it.</p></blockquote>
<p>The statements from Coinbase follow the recent auto-conversion from USDC to BUSD events at Binance and Wazirx. Furthermore, USDC&#x2019;s market valuation has dropped a great deal during the past few months. USDC&#x2019;s market cap tapped a high of more than 56 billion nominal U.S. dollars in June 2022.</p>
<p>Today, the USDC market cap is 23.57% lower at $42.80 billion. Tether&#x2019;s market cap, however, has shrunk a great deal as well, sliding from a high of more than 83 billion nominal U.S. dollars to today&#x2019;s $65.86 billion. Tether&#x2019;s market cap hit the $83 billion high in April 2022 and now it&#x2019;s 20.65% lower according to statistics recorded on Dec. 9, 2022.</p>

The ZOGI token is a wrapped version of the primary BEZOGE token optimized for the Zogi Labs decentralized ecosystem. From day one of launch, ZOGI will be available on Cronos, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a> Chain & Ethereum, rapidly boosting the exposure of the token which can now be wrapped and moved between chains instantly, with very low gas fees using the upcoming Zogi Bridge. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#x201C;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the launch of ZOGI on Cronos, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a> Chain & Ethereum, we&#x2019;re taking our native token BEZOGE to the next level by allowing users to wrap their BEZOGE into ZOGI and bridge it quickly and securely between chains. ZOGI expands our ecosystem to multiple chains, and we expect to see massive growth and exposure, giving our dedicated community the flexibility they need to increase the utility of their BEZOGE & ZOGI tokens</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#x201D; Steve Murray, CEO, Zogi Labs</span></p>
<p><b>Wrap & bridge in Zogi Hub</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Zogi Hub acts as a portal for everything Zogi. Within the decentralized application, users will be able to access all Zogi products in one place, with the Wrapper and Bridge being available first. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wrapping allows BEZOGE holders to wrap their tokens into ZOGI at a 1 to 1 billion ratio. ZOGI can then be bridged to one of the new chains (Cronos / Ethereum / <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a> Chain) using the fast & secure Zogi Bridge. The bridge, developed in-house gives Zogi holders total control over the bridging process, maximizing security and transparency with every transaction, letting customers bridge between chains with ease and comfort in a single click.</span></p>

<p><b>Why ZOGI is good for BEZOGE holders</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The launch of ZOGI gives current and new BEZOGE holders the flexibility to hold their tokens on three different chains, as opposed to just one. With the goal of being chain agnostic, multi-chain ZOGI presents holders with the following benefits:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower gas fees. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enhanced flexibility.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Access to new ecosystems, each chain has its own unique user base.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More chains to be supported in the near future. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only way to mint ZOGI is by locking BEZOGE into the wrapping contract, ZOGI can also be unwrapped at the same rate so that users can reap the benefits of both tokens. </span></p>

The global crypto market cap is 2.28% higher as of writing, as markets prepared for the release of U.S. consumer sentiment data. Quant was another big mover, as prices surged for a second straight day.</strong></p>
<h2>Polygon (MATIC)</h2>
<p>Polygon (MATIC) was a notable mover on Friday, as the token surged to its highest point since Monday.</p>
<p>Following a low of $0.9062 on Thursday, MATIC/USD raced to an intraday peak of $0.9324 earlier today.</p>
<p>As a result of this, the token moved closer to a key resistance level of $0.9540, which was last hit December 4.</p>

<p>Whilst prices near a ceiling, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has also moved towards its own point of support at 53.00.</p>
<p>The 10-day (red) moving average is also trending higher, with it remaining above its 25-day (blue) counterpart.</p>
<p>Despite recent turbulence, this is a sign of bullish momentum in the market, with some expecting further surges in price this weekend</p>

<h2>Quant (QNT)</h2>
<p>Quant (QNT) was another token to surge on Friday, with prices rising for a second straight session.</p>
<p>QNT/USD moved to a high of $124.88 earlier in the day, less than 24 hours after hitting a bottom at $120.70.</p>
<p>Today’s move sent QNT past a recent resistance point at $122.00, with bulls now appearing to take price to a higher ceiling.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, this point of resistance seems to be the $132.00 mark, which is where quant started the week.</p>
<p>In order to recapture this mark, QNT bulls will first need to overcome the upcoming resistance on the RSI of 52.00.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin&#x2019;s Market Cap Is Just Below Chevron&#x2019;s and Just Above the Home Depot&#x2019;s Market Valuations</h2>
<p>Just over a year ago in Nov. 2021, bitcoin&#x2019;s (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) market capitalization was the eighth largest out of a myriad of companies and assets traded globally. At the time, on Nov. 9, 2021, an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211109060650/https://companiesmarketcap.com/assets-by-market-cap/">archive.org snapshot</a> collected from companiesmarketcap.com shows <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s market valuation was $1.289 trillion as each unit was swapping for just over $68K.</p>

<p>On that day, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s market cap was below the precious metal silver&#x2019;s overall valuation, which was $1.380 trillion on Nov. 9, 2021. The leading crypto asset was just above Tesla&#x2019;s $1.167 trillion market valuation recorded 395 days ago. Additionally, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) was situated in the top 20 positions of assets ranked by market capitalization as <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> held the 15th largest market cap on Nov. 9, 2021.</p>

<p>At the time, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>&#x2019;s market valuation was around $570.45 billion as ether was swapping for $4,839 per unit. Ethereum&#x2019;s market cap was below the company Tencent which had a market valuation of around $588.07 billion. The second leading crypto asset&#x2019;s market cap was above JPMorgan Chase&#x2019;s valuation which was $499.61 billion 395 days ago.</p>

<p>Today, on Dec. 9, 2022, the top two leading crypto assets <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> have much lower valuations than they did a year ago. Bitcoin is not represented in the top ten standings of assets ranked by market capitalization as it&#x2019;s now within the top 30 positions and ranked at 26. The $331.76 billion market cap <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> holds today is just below Chevron&#x2019;s market cap of around $335.56 billion.</p>
<p>Further, bitcoin&#x2019;s market capitalization is just above the overall market valuation of Home Depot, which is valued at $330.30 billion on Dec. 9. Ethereum has slid a great deal from the 15th largest position as it now holds the 72nd spot with a market cap of around $155.25 billion. Ether&#x2019;s market cap is below the United Parcel Service (UPS) which is $155.36 billion, and it&#x2019;s just above the valuation of Adobe ($154.61B).</p>

<p>Ethereum&#x2019;s current market price is roughly 73.7% lower than it was 395 days ago on Nov. 9, 2021. Though <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> have seen their market caps drop lower during the last year, the same can be said for a large number of different assets and companies. Some assets, like gold&#x2019;s overall market valuation, conversely recorded increases over the last 12 months. Gold&#x2019;s cap in Nov. 2021 was around $11.605 trillion, and today it&#x2019;s worth $11.910 trillion.</p>
<p>Microsoft was the second-largest asset a year ago, but it&#x2019;s now in the third position as Microsoft&#x2019;s valuation dropped from $2.53 trillion to today&#x2019;s $1.844 trillion. Google&#x2019;s or Alphabet&#x2019;s market cap was around $1.98 trillion and in the fifth position 395 days ago on Nov. 9, 2021, and on Dec. 9, 2022, it&#x2019;s down to $1.213 trillion. Silver&#x2019;s position in the top ten list moved up from the seventh to the fifth position, but the precious metal&#x2019;s market cap still dropped from $1.38 trillion to today&#x2019;s $1.316 trillion.</p>

Cryptocurrencies were mostly higher in today&#x2019;s session, as prices rebounded from recent losses. Ethereum also surged earlier in the day, climbing closer to the $1,300 level.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) climbed higher in today&#x2019;s session, with the coin surging back above the $17,000 level.</p>
<p>Following a low of $16,788.78 on Thursday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD raced to an intraday high of $17,274.60 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>The move saw bitcoin rally beyond its resistance level at $17,200, hitting a five-day high in the process.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> has since retreated from earlier highs, as bullish momentum faded soon after the breakout.</p>
<p>As of writing, the relative strength index (RSI) is now tracking at 50.93, which is marginally below a ceiling at 52.00.</p>
<p>Should the index continue to move higher, then the next target for bulls will likely be the $17,600 point.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>In addition to bitcoin, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) also edged higher in today&#x2019;s session, with prices rebounding from recent losses.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD moved to a peak of $1,286.23 on Friday, less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $1,227.50 during Thursday&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>As a result of today&#x2019;s move, the coin neared a key resistance level of $1,305, rising to its highest point since Monday in the process.</p>

<p>Currently, it appears as though ethereum bulls are targeting a move beyond the $1,300 mark, however a ceiling on the RSI seems to be in the way.</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is tracking at 52.00, which has also been a key point of resistance in the past.</p>
<p>Bulls would need to overcome this hurdle first, in order to send prices towards the targeted $1,300 level.</p>

According to the proposal, all crypto service providers, regardless of where they are based, will have to abide by the new rules. </strong></p>
<h2>EU to Consider New Reporting Requirements for Crypto Platforms Serving European Users</h2>
<p>The executive power in Brussels intends to push through new “tax transparency rules” for the crypto industry. The proposal announced on Thursday concerns all service providers facilitating transactions in crypto assets for customers residing in the EU, not only those that are based there.</p>
<p>At the moment, tax authorities in the bloc lack the information needed to monitor proceeds obtained by using cryptocurrencies, the European Commission (EC) insisted. They are limited in their ability to ensure levies are paid effectively while Europeans lose tax revenues, it stated.</p>
<p>The new regulations, meant to complement the Markets in Crypto-assets (<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/eu-makes-deal-on-mica-legislation-to-regulate-crypto-markets/">MiCA</a>) legislation and the anti-money laundering rules <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/eu-agreement-reached-on-anti-money-laundering-rules-for-cryptocurrencies/">agreed</a> upon earlier this year, should improve the ability of member states to detect and counter tax fraud, tax evasion and tax avoidance, the Commission elaborated.</p>
<p>The reporting requirements will apply to all crypto service providers, regardless of their size and location, which process transactions of clients residing in the EU. “Serious non-compliance” will trigger penalties with a set minimum level valid across the Union.</p>

<p>“Our proposal will ensure that member states get the information they need to ensure that taxes are paid on gains made in trading or investing crypto assets,” commented Commissioner for Economy Paolo Gentiloni. “It is also fully consistent with the OECD initiative on the Crypto Asset Reporting Framework,” he added.</p>
<p>The plan is to impose the new obligations on the crypto sector through amendments to the Directive for Administration Cooperation (DAC). The EC also suggested extending them to cover e-money and other digital currencies.</p>
<p>The draft proposal will be submitted to the European Parliament for consultations and to the Council of the European Union for adoption. The European Commission expects the updated Directive to be enforced on Jan. 1, 2026.</p>
