<h2>Coinbase Winding Down Majority of Japanese Operations</h2>
<p>Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase is closing the bulk of its operations in Japan, Nana Murugesan, vice president for business development and international, revealed in an interview with Bloomberg Wednesday. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;ve decided to wind down the majority of our operations in Japan, which led to eliminating most of the roles in our Japan entity.</p></blockquote>
<p>Coinbase teamed up with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. to launch a crypto exchange in Japan in 2021.</p>
<p>Murugesan explained that Coinbase is finalizing its discussions with Japan&#8217;s top financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA). He noted that a small number of employees in Japan will remain to ensure the safety and security of customer assets.</p>
<h2>Coinbase Downsizing Globally</h2>
<p>Coinbase has been cutting its workforce globally. CEO Brian Armstrong <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/a-message-from-ceo-and-co-founder-brian-armstrong-to-coinbase-employees">announced</a> the company&#8217;s latest round of job cuts Tuesday. Noting that the crypto exchange is &#8220;letting go of about 950 people,&#8221; the executive explained that the move is necessary to weather the industry downturn. He added:</p>
<blockquote><p>We will be shutting down several projects where we have a lower probability of success.</p></blockquote>

<p>In June last year, Coinbase said it made a decision to reduce the size of its team by about 18%, or about 1,200 employees, to <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/a-message-from-coinbase-ceo-and-cofounder-brian-armstrong">ensure</a> the company stays &#8220;healthy during this economic downturn.&#8221; The crypto exchange eliminated 60 more positions in November.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Armstrong said Tuesday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite everything we&#8217;ve been through as a company and an industry, I&#8217;m still optimistic about our future and the future of crypto. Progress doesn&#8217;t always happen in a straight line, and sometimes it can feel like we&#8217;re taking two steps forward and one step back.</p></blockquote>
<p>Similar to Coinbase, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/kraken-shutting-down-crypto-exchange-in-japan-citing-weak-global-crypto-market/">Kraken</a> said in December last year that it is shutting down services in Japan. <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-acquires-licensed-japanese-crypto-exchange-prepares-to-enter-japan-as-regulated-entity/">Binance</a>, on the other hand, is expanding its operations in the country by acquiring a regulated Japanese crypto exchange.</p>

Overall, Binance has been approved to operate in 15 jurisdictions, including seven EU countries.</strong></p>
<h2>Binance Approved to Operate in 7 EU Countries</h2>
<p>Cryptocurrency exchange Binance announced Thursday that its Swedish entity, Binance Nordics AB, &#8220;has been granted registration as a financial institution for management and trading in virtual currency by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (Swedish FSA).&#8221; Binance explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sweden becomes the seventh EU Member State in which Binance has been granted authorization, following authorizations in: France, Italy, Lithuania, Spain, Cyprus, and Poland.</p></blockquote>
<p>Per Nordkvist, deputy head of the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority&#8217;s banks division, told Reuters that the FSA registration allows Binance to launch a website in Swedish and market its digital asset services directly to consumers in the Nordic country.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sweden fully adopts EU laws and has further local requirements, so we have been careful to ensure that Binance Nordics AB has adopted risk and AML [anti-money laundering] policies to match this exacting standard,&#8221; said Binance&#8217;s Nordics and Benelux lead, Roy van Krimpen. He further revealed:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our next big task will be the successful migration and launch of local operations, including hiring of local talent, organizing more events and delivering more crypto education in Sweden.</p></blockquote>

<p>Overall, Binance has received regulatory permissions or approvals in 15 jurisdictions. Outside of Europe, the crypto exchange has received authorization to provide services in Bahrain, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and South Africa. It has also received approval from Kazakhstan&#8217;s Astana International Financial Centre, Abu Dhabi Global Market, and Dubai World Trade Center.</p>
<p>Binance said this week that it has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-joins-association-of-certified-sanctions-specialists/">joined</a> the Association of Certified Sanctions Specialists (ACSS) which works to improve the qualification of sanctions compliance professionals employed by global companies.</p>

El Salvador has adopted the cryptocurrency as legal tender and has passed a new regulatory framework for the issuance of its long-awaited bitcoin-backed Volcano bonds.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Showcased in Miss Universe 2023</h2>
<p>The Miss Universe 2023 contestant from El Salvador, Alejandra Guajardo, surprised viewers Wednesday night with her choice of costume. Guajardo walked onto the stage in the 71st Miss Universe National Costume Show wearing a costume representing &#x201C;the evolution of the Salvadoran currency,&#x201D; the Miss Universe El Salvador official Instagram account described, adding that the outfit is designed by Francisco Guerrero.</p>
<p>Miss El Salvador&#x2019;s national costume features cacao beans, the col&#xF3;n, the U.S. dollar, and the Bitcoin symbol. Originally, cacao was used as currency in El Salvador. The col&#xF3;n became the official currency of El Salvador from 1892 until it was replaced by the U.S. dollar in January 2001. The costume&#x2019;s predominant colors are gold, silver, and bronze.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="es" dir="ltr">Esta noche, Miss Universo El Salvador, Alejandra Guajardo, representa la historia de las monedas del pa&#xED;s, desde el col&#xF3;n hasta el <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a>, en su traje nacional. <a href="https://t.co/q5tVbytJXl">pic.twitter.com/q5tVbytJXl</a></p>
<p>&#x2014; Noticiero El Salvador &#x1F1F8;&#x1F1FB; (@NoticieroSLV) <a href="https://twitter.com/NoticieroSLV/status/1613404984724393984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 12, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Now bitcoin is legal tender in El Salvador alongside the U.S. dollar. El Salvador became the first country to make the world&#x2019;s largest cryptocurrency legal tender in September 2021. Since then, the country, led by the pro-bitcoin president Nayib Bukele, has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/el-salvador-buys-80-more-bitcoin-as-btc-fell-below-19k-president-insists-bitcoin-is-the-future/">purchased</a> thousands of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> for its treasury. In November last year, Bukele announced that his country will <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/el-salvador-to-buy-bitcoin-every-day-starting-tomorrow-president-says/">buy bitcoin every day</a>.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Salvadoran legislative assembly passed the digital asset issuance law that was proposed last November. It includes a new regulatory framework for the issuance of bitcoin-backed Volcano bonds. &#x201C;This new digital asset regulatory framework paves the way for its much anticipated Volcano token issuance,&#x201D; according to <a href="https://blog.bitfinex.com/announcements/el-salvadors-historic-digital-asset-securities-law-passes/">Bitfinex</a>, which will be a technology provider for the nation&#x2019;s Volcano token.</p>

The sports venue was branded FTX Arena as part of a multi-year, multi-million dollar sponsorship deal between the now-bankrupt crypto exchange and Miami-Dade County in 2021. </strong></p>
<h2>FTX Signage and Advertising to Be Removed From Downtown Miami Sports Facility</h2>
<p>The FTX naming-rights agreement for the Miami Heat arena was terminated on Wednesday by a federal bankruptcy judge in Delaware. According to the order, the contract between Miami-Dade County and what was one of the largest digital asset exchanges ends retroactively, on Dec. 30, 2022.</p>
<p>From now on, the stadium of NBA’s Miami Heat should not be officially referred to as ‘FTX Arena’ and authorities in the county will be free to remove all signage, advertisements and promotional materials with the FTX name and logo, U.S. media reported.</p>
<p>The basketball arena was named after FTX under a 19-year, $135-million <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-exchange-ftx-on-the-verge-of-winning-naming-rights-for-the-miami-heats-arena/">sponsorship deal</a> between the crypto trading platform and Miami-Dade County in effect since June 2021. The next payment to the county, $5.5 million, was due on Jan. 1, 2023.</p>
<p>Right after the company <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/troubled-crypto-exchange-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection-ceo-steps-down/">filed</a> for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November, Miami Heat and Miami-Dade County said they were taking steps to terminate their business relationships with FTX and find a new naming-rights partner.</p>
<p>Following their announcement, a photo was circulated on social media, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/from-mercedes-f1-to-miami-heat-sports-teams-suspend-ftx-sponsorships/">showing</a> what seemed to be workers dismantling the FTX sign on the building’s rooftop. The FTX branding is also on the basketball court and over the arena’s entrances. In his Dec. 11 order, Judge John T. Dorsey stated that terminating of the naming rights shall be effective immediately.</p>

<p>FTX, which had become a major cryptocurrency exchange, collapsed amid liquidity issues, leaving potentially over a million customers with losses totaling $8 billion. Its founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) resigned and a new management team was appointed.</p>
<p>In December, SBF was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bahamian-ag-and-prime-minister-announce-sam-bankman-frieds-arrest-in-the-bahamas/">arrested</a> in the Bahamas, extradited to the U.S. and charged with multiple counts of defrauding clients and lenders to which he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/former-ftx-ceo-sam-bankman-fried-pleads-not-guilty-to-criminal-charges-bond-signees-names-remain-sealed/">pleaded not guilty</a>. He has since been released on bail, with his trial scheduled to begin in early October.</p>
<p>In 2021, FTX entered into a number of other sponsorship deals with teams and organizations from various sports. Soon after securing the naming rights for the Miami Heat’s stadium, FTX became the official crypto exchange of Major League Baseball (<a href="https://www.mlb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MLB</a>).</p>
<p>Then in September of that year, the company signed a long-term sponsorship agreement with Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One Team. That partnership also ended after the bankruptcy filing, with Mercedes announcing its cars will no longer carry the FTX logo.</p>

The research was reportedly used to cast doubt on specific treatments, such as the use of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.</strong></p>
<h2>Controversy Surrounds Former CEO of FTX and Funding for Research to Discredit Covid-19 Treatments</h2>
<p>There are several reports claiming that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/from-a-32-billion-valuation-to-financial-troubles-an-in-depth-look-at-the-rise-and-fall-of-ftx/">Sam Bankman-Fried</a> (SBF), the co-founder of the now-defunct crypto exchange FTX, helped fund causes related to pandemic prevention. During the first week of 2023, reports revealed that SBF met with senior Biden administration officials before he was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bahamian-ag-and-prime-minister-announce-sam-bankman-frieds-arrest-in-the-bahamas/">arrested</a> for fraud. When questioned about the meetings, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indicted-ftx-co-founder-sam-bankman-fried-discussed-pandemic-prevention-with-biden-administration-officials/">told the press</a> that the meetings involved discussions about &#8220;pandemic prevention.&#8221;</p>
<p>Much of the news regarding SBF&#8217;s donations to pandemic prevention follows a variety of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-failed-experiment-of-covid-lockdowns-11599000890">reports</a> that show Covid-19 lockdowns had a <a href="https://mises.org/wire/do-lockdowns-work-mounting-evidence-says-no">negative impact</a> on the global economy, papers that suggest ivermectin has <a href="https://journals.lww.com/americantherapeutics/fulltext/2021/08000/ivermectin_for_prevention_and_treatment_of.7.aspx">demonstrated</a> therapeutic benefits in Covid-19 infections, and that hydroxychloroquine is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7534595/">effective</a> against Covid-19 when administered early. Additionally, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-18307-4">many people</a> have expressed <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/former-espn-employees-suing-company-covid-19-vaccine-requirement">skepticism</a> about the Covid-19 mRNA vaccine and there have been <a href="https://rumble.com/v1zkz94-dr.-mccullough-us-senate-to-save-lives-pull-the-covid-19-vaccines-off-the-m.html">calls</a> to <a href="https://joelshirschhorn.substack.com/p/high-priority-for-new-year-remove?utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=email">remove it</a> from the market due to <a href="https://expose-news.com/2023/01/05/pfizergate-disaster-excess-deaths-mortality-rates/">safety concerns</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a number of reports indicate that FTX was <a href="https://iceni.substack.com/p/it-wasnt-a-lab-leak-it-was-intentional">funding</a> a significant amount of pandemic-related propaganda during the early days of the pandemic. SBF&#8217;s brother, Gabe Bankman-Fried, was the director of &#8220;Guarding Against Pandemics,&#8221; and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/11/16/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-pandemic-prevention/">reports note</a> that FTX &#8220;fueled&#8221; the organization with fresh cash.</p>
<p>According to the Washington Post, the organization spent $1 million to lobby Congress and hired 26 lobbyists. &#8220;The brothers tried hard to keep congressional attention on biodefense,&#8221; Luciana Borio, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations and an infectious-disease expert, told the Washington Post.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.themainewire.com/2022/11/bankrupt-ftx-gave-18-2m-to-early-covid-19-researchers-who-cast-doubt-on-ivermectin-and-hydroxychloroquine/">Reports</a> further indicate that, allegedly, FTX and its donating arm, the &#8220;FTX Foundation,&#8221; funneled $18.25 million to early Covid-19 researchers who wrote specific papers meant to cast doubt on certain Covid-19 treatments. A <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-ftx-foundation-supports-the-global-expansion-of-the-trial-of-the-year-award-winning-together-trial-301547995.html">press release</a> published on May 16 states that the FTX Foundation gave millions to the &#8220;Together Trial.&#8221; According to the press statement, &#8220;Together&#8221; is a consortium that &#8220;includes representatives from the World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Guidance Committee on Covid-19 Therapeutics.&#8221;</p>

<p>A report from themainewire.com shows that the &#8220;Together Trial&#8221; research included two studies that were used to discredit the use of hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin (<a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6112a257d1c1153666ccb987/t/6247683566201f46f1982ae8/1648846902670/nejmoa2115869.pdf">study 1</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33885775/">study 2</a>).</p>
<p>&#8220;Together Trial&#8217;s research included a study that found ivermectin&#8217;s benefits for patients suffering from Covid-19 were unclear and a study that concluded hydroxychloroquine did not show any benefit in decreasing hospitalizations,&#8221; themainewire.com contributor Steve Robinson wrote. As time progresses, many people are of the <a href="https://twitter.com/RepThomasMassie/status/1613502126629748736?s=20&amp;t=J-KmzQtRWeJKM_uTyr9gIw">opinion</a> that pandemic prevention measures have not been effective and may have caused more harm than good.</p>

<p>FTX&#8217;s alleged funding towards research that aimed to cast doubt on specific Covid-19 treatments follows <a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/pfizer-scott-gottlieb-censor-twitter-natural-immunity-covid-risk-et/">accusations</a> that a Pfizer board member, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, reportedly lobbied Twitter to censor posts that said natural immunity is superior to the Covid-19 mRNA vaccine.</p>
<p>Most of the social media censorship and academic discrediting stemming from researchers paid to push Covid-19 propaganda has caused a significant amount of confusion over the last two years. While the now-bankrupt FTX was once a top-five crypto asset exchange, the company&#8217;s foundation also promoted unfounded and <a href="https://mises.org/wire/pandemic-over-feds-arent-giving-their-emergency-powers">ineffective pandemic measures</a> that may have caused a significant amount of harm to the general population.</p>
<p><em><strong>What is your opinion on the alleged funding by FTX towards research that aimed to cast doubt on specific Covid-19 treatments? Do you think this has caused a significant amount of confusion during the last two years? Share your thoughts in the comments below.</strong></em></p>

The Polygon-minted NFTs act as passes for a one-on-one Zoom meeting with the 45th president of the United States and a gala dinner with Trump. During the past 24 hours, the &#x201C;Win Trump Prizes&#x201D; collection has seen 38 ether, or roughly $53,000 in sales, on Thursday, Jan. 12, 2023.</strong></p>
<h2>Trump&#x2019;s NFT Prize Collection Auctions off on Opensea&#x2019;s NFT Marketplace</h2>
<p>The former president of the United States, Donald Trump, recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/while-his-digital-trading-cards-tumble-in-value-trump-says-his-cute-nfts-were-about-the-art/">sold a collection</a> of non-fungible token (NFT) cards that sold out on the first day of its launch. The NFT collection <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/donald-trump-trading-card-nfts-skyrocket-in-value-despite-being-mocked-for-his-major-announcement/">caused a stir</a> among pundits on the left side of the political spectrum. When the sale was conducted, NFT owners were <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/trump-launches-nft-card-collection-sweepstake-winners-could-dine-or-golf-with-the-45th-president/">given a chance to win special prizes</a> related to Trump, including golfing with the former president, a one-on-one Zoom call, and an invitation to a gala dinner with Trump in Florida.</p>

<p>Those prizes were minted as NFTs on the Polygon blockchain, just like the trading card set. They are now seeing secondary sales on Opensea, the leading NFT marketplace in terms of sales volume. At 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Jan. 12, 2023, the &#x201C;Win Trump Prizes&#x201D; collection on Opensea has seen 38 ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>), or roughly $53,000 in sales, during the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/win-trump-prizes/activity">Win Trump Prizes collection</a> has a floor value of around 0.0219 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>. One particular ticket, called a &#x201C;Group Zoom Event w/ Pres. Trump,&#x201D; is selling for 0.0466 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> or $66.43 for the NFT ticket. Trump&#x2019;s prize NFT sales currently hold the 48th position in terms of NFT collection sales in the last day. It has surpassed the Rarepass NFT collection, which raked in $52,458 today, and it is below the Rektguy NFT collection&#x2019;s $54,444 in sales over the last 24 hours.</p>

<p>The Win Trump Prizes NFT collection, however, has done better in 24-hour sales than collections such as Cool Cats, Zed Run, Solana Monkey Business, and World of Women on Jan. 12. The Win Trump Prizes collection sales are lackluster and they only represent 0.18% of the <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io">$29.77 million</a> in NFT sales on Thursday. Trump&#x2019;s original trading card NFTs have seen <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/trumpdigitaltradingcards">$20,701 in sales</a> on Jan. 12, which is 44.90% lower than the day prior.</p>

Litecoin will be the first major proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain to see a reward reduction before Bitcoin&#x2019;s upcoming halving, which is expected to occur 203 days from now.</strong></p>
<h2>Litecoin Halving Set to Occur on or Around Aug. 3, 2023</h2>
<p><a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC/">Litecoin</a>, the 14th-largest cryptocurrency today, is <a href="https://explorer.viawallet.com/halving">preparing to experience</a> a block reward halving in 202 days. It will be the first major proof-of-work (PoW) cryptocurrency to have a reward halving, besides the upcoming reduction scheduled to happen in 158 days for Dash. However, Dash&#x2019;s reduction is different than a halving as the reward will be reduced from 2.763 Dash to 2.566 Dash. Like Bitcoin, Litecoin&#x2019;s block halving cuts the reward in half (by 50%) and it will drop from 12.5 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> to 6.25 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>.</p>

<p>While <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC/">litecoin (LTC)</a> holds the 14th-largest market capitalization today, it used to be a top-ten cryptocurrency contender in the early days of the crypto market. <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>&#x2019;s network has many differences from Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) as there are more coins in circulation &#x2014; currently more than 72 million <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> in circulation. However, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> is nearing its maximum supply of 84 million. Bitcoin&#x2019;s block time is usually around 10 minutes per block, but <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> blocks are much faster at 2.5 minutes per block.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">&#x1F525;Litecoin Halving Cycles 2W chart&#x1F525;</p>
<p>Something to give us some bullish vibes for short term future and real strong bullishness starting from June 2024.</p>
<p>&#x1F4A1; Next Litecoin halving will be on August 3rd 2023 <a href="https://t.co/8tzlCUQICp">pic.twitter.com/8tzlCUQICp</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Two-week market statistics show that <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC/">litecoin (LTC)</a> has gained 29% against the U.S. dollar, but <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> is down 79% from the cryptocurrency&#x2019;s all-time high. <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> reached an all-time high of around $410 per unit over a year ago on May 10, 2021. In addition to the difference in supply between <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> and Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>), Litecoin&#x2019;s proof-of-work algorithm, Scrypt, is different from SHA-256. The upcoming <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> halving will be Litecoin&#x2019;s third block reward reduction since its inception.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> experienced its first halving on Aug. 25, 2015, and this halving reduced the block reward for miners from 50 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> to 25 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>. <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> block halvings occur every 840,000 blocks, or four years. The second Litecoin block reward halving occurred on Aug. 5, 2019. This particular halving reduced the block reward for miners from 25 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> to 12.5 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>, the current reward level for Litecoin miners today.</p>
<p class="p1"></p>
<p>In addition to Dash and Litecoin, the next three blockchains that will see block reward halvings are Bitcoin Cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>) in 450 days, Bitcoin SV (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BSV" target="_blank">BSV</a>) in 455 days, and Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) in 474 days. Ethereum Classic is expected to see a block reduction similar to Dash&#x2019;s in 568 days. And, Zcash (ZEC) will see a halving in 677 days. The ZEC block reward halving will see the subsidy drop from 3.125 ZEC to 1.5625 after the halving occurs on or around Nov. 20, 2024.</p>

At the time of writing, Bitcoin&#x2019;s mining difficulty appears to be on track for a 10% increase, rising from 34.09 trillion to an all-time high of 37.57 trillion.</strong></p>
<h2>Upcoming Difficulty Retarget to Boost Hashrate Requirements</h2>
<p>The leading cryptocurrency network, Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>), is set to experience a record-setting difficulty increase in three days, on or around Jan. 15, 2023. At the time of writing, the network&#x2019;s hash rate is at 268.79 exahash per second (EH/s) and the blockchain&#x2019;s computational power reached an <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-hashrate-reaches-all-time-high-boost-could-lead-to-record-setting-difficulty-increase/">all-time high</a> on Jan. 6, 2023. On that day, at block height 770,709, the network&#x2019;s hash power reached 361.20 EH/s.</p>

<p>Bitcoin block times, also known as block intervals, have been between <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-confirmationtime.html">8 minutes, 52 seconds</a>, and <a href="https://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com/dashboard/">9 minutes, 6 seconds</a> in length. The block interval is the average amount of time it takes for a new block to be added to the blockchain, and the network&#x2019;s difficulty is designed to keep the block time around 10 minutes per block.</p>
<p>The actual time between blocks can vary from this average, and since the last <a href="https://btc.com/stats/diff">difficulty change</a> on Jan. 2, 2023, at block height 770,112, block intervals have been faster. For this reason, the difficulty retarget on Jan. 15 will be a notable increase, and a rise that has not been recorded since October 2022.</p>

<h2>Foundry USA and Antpool Command Nearly Half of Bitcoin&#x2019;s Global Hashrate</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, and up until the next difficulty change, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s network difficulty is approximately 34.09 trillion. This means that, on average, it takes 34 trillion hashes (or attempts) to find a valid <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> block and add it to the blockchain. Currently, analytics sites detail that Bitcoin&#x2019;s next difficulty change is expected to rise by <a href="https://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com/dashboard/">10.1%</a> to <a href="https://btc.com/stats/diff">10.21%</a> in three days.</p>
<p>At the highest estimate, the difficulty would reach an all-time high of 37.57 trillion, and bitcoin miners would need to exert 37.57 trillion hashes to find a block on the Bitcoin blockchain. Presently, Foundry USA is the <a href="https://btc.com/stats/pool">top mining pool</a> during the last three days, with 29.57% of the global hashrate. Foundry is followed by Antpool (19.36%), F2pool (16.38%), Binance Pool (8.72%), Viabtc (8.30%), and Braiins Pool (3.40%), respectively. Between Foundry and Antpool, the two pools currently command 48.93% of the network&#x2019;s total hashrate.</p>

The move came as inflation in the United States fell to 6.5% as markets were expecting. Polkadot was another notable mover, with prices climbing close to a four-week high. </strong></p>
<h2>Avalanche (AVAX)</h2>
<p>Avalanche (AVAX) rose by as much as 22% in today’s session, as cryptocurrencies reacted to the latest U.S. inflation report.</p>
<p>AVAX/USD moved to a peak of $16.11 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after falling to a bottom of $12.41.</p>
<p>Thursday’s spike in price pushed avalanche to its highest point since November 8, when price was at a peak of $18.15.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, earlier gains have somewhat eased, with AVAX now trading at $15.18.</p>
<p>This came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) failed to break out from a resistance at the 80.00 level.</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is now tracking at 69.94, which is still deep in overbought territory.</p>

<h2>Polkadot (DOT)</h2>
<p>Polkadot (DOT), was another big gainer in today’s session, with prices moving closer towards a four-week high.</p>
<p>Following a low of $4.84, DOT/USD managed to reach an intraday high of $5.16 earlier on Thursday.</p>
<p>As a result of this move, DOT broke out of a key resistance level of $5.15, hitting its strongest point since December 16 in the process.</p>

<p>As can be seen from the chart, the 14-day RSI has failed to move beyond its long-term ceiling of 68.00, and has since slipped lower.</p>
<p>Price strength is now tracking at 63.10, with DOT declining from its earlier peak, and the asset is trading at $5.09.</p>
<p>In order for the token to continue to move higher, there will first need to be a rally above its 68.00 point on the RSI.</p>

Siika Mileva, a spokesperson for Bulgaria&#8217;s attorney general, said the probe into Nexo is a large-scale operation involving 300 investigators from various agencies, including the National Security Service, Gendarmerie, and Sofia Police.</strong></p>
<h2>Bulgarian Law Enforcement Raids Offices of Crypto Lender Nexo for Suspected Money Laundering and Sanctions Violations</h2>
<p>On Jan. 12, 2023, reports indicate that Bulgarian law enforcement officials raided cryptocurrency lender Nexo&#8217;s offices. The company is under investigation for violating sanctions against Russia and money laundering crimes, according to Siika Mileva, spokesperson for Bulgaria&#8217;s attorney general. The head of Bulgaria&#8217;s cybercrime unit, Svetlio Vasilev, stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>A client of the platform who transferred cryptocurrency has been officially declared an organizer of terrorist activity. It remains to be determined who will be charged with the crimes. More than 15 addresses are being searched, and new persons of interest are being established.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nexo, which is based in London but also operates offices in Sofia where the raid took place, immediately denied any wrongdoing in a statement on Twitter following the story. &#8220;Over the years, we have turned down a lot of business because Nexo never makes compromises with regard to our very stringent anti-money laundering and know-your-customer policies. But we have always known that this is how you build a sustainable business,&#8221; the company said on Thursday. Nexo added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Unfortunately, with the recent regulatory crackdown on crypto, some regulators have recently adopted the kick first, ask questions later approach. In corrupt countries, it is bordering with racketeering, but that too shall pass.</p></blockquote>
<p>The news follows reports at the end of September 2022 that a half-dozen securities regulators from the United States were probing Nexo and filed actions against the firm&#8217;s lending services. The state of New York and attorney general Letitia James also filed a lawsuit against Nexo. Following the lawsuit from James, Nexo declared it was exiting the U.S. market. The spokesperson for Bulgaria&#8217;s chief prosecutor detailed that roughly $94 billion has been funneled through Nexo over the last five years.</p>

<p>Nexo&#8217;s executives believe the investigation and raid are unfounded and further stressed that the company is &#8220;always cooperating with the relevant authorities and regulators.&#8221; In addition to searching the offices in Sofia, prosecutors detailed that the investigation was launched several months ago after alleged suspicious transactions were made. Allegedly, the reported transactions were meant to circumvent Western sanctions imposed against the Russian Federation.</p>
