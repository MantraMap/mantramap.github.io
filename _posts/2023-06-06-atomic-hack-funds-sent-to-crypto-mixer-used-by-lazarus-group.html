<p>According to reports from Elliptic, funds drained from the Atomic Wallet hack have been sent to Sinbad, a crypto mixer used by the Lazarus Group. </p>
<p>According to reports by crypto tracing firm Elliptic Enterprises, the funds drained from the hack on the Atomic Wallet on June 3 have been sent to a crypto mixer used by the Lazarus Group, a notorious North Korean hacking operation.</p>

<p>Elliptic reported that its Investigation Team traced funds from the $35 million hack to Sinbad.io, a cryptocurrency mixer used by the hacking group.</p>

<p>Elliptic&rsquo;s Investigations Team is also following the transaction trail, and has determined that the stolen funds are being swapped for bitcoin, before being laundered through Sinbad.io - a mixer. Previous Elliptic&nbsp;research&nbsp;revealed that Sinbad has been used intensively to launder over $100 million in proceeds of hacks perpetrated by North Korea&rsquo;s Lazarus Group.</p>
<p>This includes assets from the $540 million Axie Infinity hack and $100 million Horizon Bridge attack.</p>

Atomic Wallet Users Drained of Over $35 Million
<p>On June 3, the self-custodial, decentralised Atomic Wallet received reports that several wallets had been drained of their funds. The project confirmed the compromise on June 4 and said it would investigate the matter. &nbsp;</p>

Blender.io Relaunches As Sinbad.io
<p>Earlier reports indicated North Korean hackers had been using a new mixing service to launder stolen cryptocurrencies. Elliptic found that the crypto mixing service used by the Lazarus Group, Blender, is likely to have been re-launched as Sinbad.</p>
<p>Following a series of high-profile hacks, the United States Treasury&rsquo;s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) imposed sanctions against Blender and Tornado Cash for helping Lazarus launder close to $500 million in illicitly obtained cryptocurrencies. After the US imposed sanctions against the mixing services, Tornado Cash continued to operate while Blender ceased its operations and disappeared after reportedly taking $22 million in Bitcoin from the mixer.</p>
<p>According to Elliptic, Blender likely started operating the new service called Sinbad, which Lazarus used to launder illicit funds in October 2022.</p>
