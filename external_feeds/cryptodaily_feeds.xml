			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Gives Back Recent Gains:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 17 December 2022</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) extended its ongoing depreciation early in the Asian session as the pair traded below the psychologically-important 17000 figure, reaching the 16924.99 area following increasing risk aversion. &nbsp;&nbsp;Selling pressure intensified around the 17525 area, just above the 23.6% retracement of the depreciating range from 18385.36 to 17222.09.&nbsp; &nbsp;Stops were elected below the 17267.87 area as the downturn intensified, a level that represents the 38.2% retracement of the appreciating range from 15460 to 18385.36.&nbsp; &nbsp;Strong selling pressure around the 18385 and 17525 areas could result in tests of downside price objectives around the 16849, 16375, 15900, 15313, and 14364 levels.&nbsp; If BTC/USD is able to reclaim some upside momentum, additional technically significant upside retracement levels include the 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, the 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Below these areas, technically significant levels include the 14613, 14500.15, 13369, 10432.73, 10727, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 200-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;100-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 17110.39 and the&nbsp;200-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 17286.61.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;14500.15/ 13369.11/ 10727.75 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;18495.40/ 19199.48/ 20070.64 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bearishly below SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bearishly below MACDAverage.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bearishly below SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bearishly below MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>After suffering a huge amount of negative press over its recent proof-of-reserves audit, blockchain analytics provider CryptoQuant has verified that all Binance&rsquo;s reserves are accounted for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency market has been roiled over the past few days by FUD suggesting that this and that crypto platform is about to go down. Binance, being the biggest trading platform in the sector, has become the number one target for most of the FUD.</p>
<p>The Binance proof-of-reserves report put together by Mazars did confirm that Binance&rsquo;s bitcoin reserves were overcollateralised. However, after the report was criticised by certain industry experts, Mazars started to distance itself from the report and now the link to it is dead and not available.</p>
<p>The problem appears to have been that the report was not a proper audit given that it was an &ldquo;agreed-upon procedure&rdquo; rather than a full audit that used a process imposed by the auditor themselves.</p>
<p>However, CryptoQuant carried out its own analysis of Binance and it found that the exchange was now the biggest in the sector with 30% of its reserves in BTC. Coinbase took second place with 26% of reserves in BTC.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Source: CryptoQuant</p>
<p>One of the key messages in the CryptoQuant report was that the Binance-reported liabilities were very similar to CryptoQuant&rsquo;s own estimation:</p>

<p>"In order to assess the data in Binance&rsquo;s Proof-of-Reserves report, we compared Binance liabilities expressed in the report to CryptoQuant&rsquo;s on-chain metric Binance BTC Reserve data (our estimate of Binance&rsquo;s customers&rsquo; deposits). We found out that the liabilities reported by Binance are very close to our estimation (99%)."</p>

<p>The report concluded that Binance&rsquo;s ETH and stablecoin reserves were &ldquo;not showing FTX-like behaviour&rdquo;, and it stated that the BNB exchange coin was not a large percentage of reserves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Binance has an acceptable "Clean Reserve,&rdquo; which means its own token, BNB, is still a low proportion of its total assets.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Crypto bank Silvergate has been hit with a class action lawsuit, alleging that it aided and abetted fraud carried out by FTX and its subsidiary Alameda Research.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed by Joewy Gonzalez &ldquo;on behalf of all others similarly situated&rdquo;, in which it is claimed that Silvergate &ldquo;aided and abetted&rdquo; FTX in fraud and breaches of fiduciary duty.</p>
<p>The complaint claims that Silvergate processed billions in transfers between the FTX client account on its platform and Alameda accounts. It also accuses Silvergate of accepting deposits from FTX investors which were fraudulently sent to Alameda to be misused.</p>
<p>In a direct quote in the complaint it was alleged that Sam Bankman-Fried, the then CEO of FTX, told a reporter that he had forgotten about the &ldquo;improper transfers&rdquo; until the collapse of his company. He was quoted as saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;it looks like people wired $8b to Alameda and &lsquo;oh god we basically forgot about the stub account that corresponded to that so it was never delivered to FTX.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the lawsuit the plaintiff accuses FTX of pursuing an &ldquo;aggressive, celebrity-fueled marketing campaign&rdquo;, and listing the following sporting partnerships:</p>

<p>&ldquo;sports and entertainment figures such as Tom Brady, Gisele Bundchen, Shaquille O&rsquo;Neal, Steph Curry, and others. FTX also obtained the naming rights to the Miami Heat&rsquo;s venue, and formalized a partnership with the Golden State Warriors.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The lawsuit alleges that Silvergate is liable for its part in the FTX investment fraud, and for its breaches of fiduciary duty. The claim asks that Silvergate be &ldquo;obligated under common law to make Plaintiff and the other investors whole.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The introduction of blockchain technology led to one of the most interesting types of investments with cryptocurrency. Blockchain also paved the way for another trendy investment in 2021: Non-fungible tokens or NFTs. The smart contracts allocated to NFTs made them more popular among both artists and investors since there was no middle party to take a share of trades. Therefore, both artists and investors could enjoy earning more financial interest.</p>
<p>Since then, the NFT market faced great hype and lots of NFT collections were uploaded to NFT marketplaces. Some brand collections got so expensive that a normal investor was not able to afford a single NFT from the collection. Though, the NFT market has shown to be totally flexible to bring up creative solutions in order to keep the hype up and even attract more investors.</p>
<p>Along with these all, the NFT world is expanding every day and mixes more areas of art and the virtual world. The unlimited number of NFT projects available as well as the latest creative NFT collections added to the market day after day seem to cause confusion for most investors. Some find it a high risk to invest in NFTs and some others find themselves hopeless to decide among the choices they have.</p>
<p>Although there are lots of articles and guides about investment in The NFT market, to the knowledge of the writer, no article has fully provided a comprehensive guide to the issues investors must know to make a safe investment in the world of NFT. Therefore, in this article, we aim to discuss all the sources that investors need to check before trading NFTs.</p>
<p>What should NFT investors know to make a successful investment?</p>
<p>the NFT world is expanding every day and lots of features have been added to the market since the start. Therefore, for NFT investors to take the highest benefits from the market, it is necessary to gain basic as well as professional information and tutorials provided for the NFT market. Here is a list of necessary points that investors need to keep in mind to improve their knowledge in the field of NFT.</p>
<p>Nature of NFTs</p>
<p>It is essential to learn not only about the nature of non-fungible tokens but also blockchain technology used with NFTs. The more you know about NFTs and about the technologies used with them, the better you can learn about the important factors to consider with NFT collections to choose from.</p>
<p>The developer team of an NFT collection</p>
<p>NFT investors always should learn about the development team of NFT collections. The future success of an NFT collection is directly related to its development team. Nobody wants to invest in a collection that its developers disappear after a while. Projects such as Ape Bored Yacht Club or Axi Infinity are strongly supported by developer teams that launch new collections from time to time and, as the result, add to the value of the tokens they released earlier.</p>
<p>Know the market flow</p>
<p>The next important item to consider for a safe and profitable investment in the NFT market is to know the flows in the market. You may find it almost impossible since it is a really huge market and nobody may get the time to check all NFT projects launched every week. Sure it is difficult, but not impossible! The NFT market provides a solution to almost all problems. The NFT market provides special tools to allow investors acquire the information they need to make an investment. Some practical tools include NFT Calendar that offers a time table to remind NFT events to investors, Rarity tools to calculate the rarity of NFT items, joining Discord servers to get the upcoming news and information about an NFT collection or its developer team, etc.</p>
<p>What should NFT investors follow to make a successful investment?</p>
<p>There are also other sources of information available for investors to keep update with the news in the NFT world. Along with joining Discords, investors also can follow the developer team&rsquo;s Twitter accounts and. Though, it is still much time-consuming to check for all details and news, especially if they keep a list of NFT collections to choose from. So, there should be a shorter way to get most of the news about NFT collections and events related to them.</p>
<p>As we already mentioned, there is always a solution to satisfy the investors in the NFT world. Here are the professional online NFT sites. Such sites are dedicated to all related to the NFT world, including NFT tutorials, NFT news and more importantly sections on NFT events and NFT drops. These professional NFT sites have gathered a team of professional experts in the field of NFTs and the Metaverse to provide the latest news on the NFT market not only weekly but also daily. See, things are getting easier when there are professional experts to analyze the NFT market, look for the most reliable NFT projects and write the latest news about them. These teams also watch the NFT brand movements and let the investors know about future events and possible drops that can be interesting to NFT investors.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s learn about the three major parts of NFT sites that definitely help investors to make the best decisions for their investments in the NFT world.</p>
<p>NFT NEWS</p>
<p>Well, it goes without saying that successful investors always need to follow the news to take the best advantage of their digital assets. Every movement of an NFT developer team or a celebrity in the world of NFTs may cause a wave in the market and change the flow of the market as well as the points of view of NFT investors. So, investors should always look for the most reliable NFT news sources.</p>
<p>NFT EVENTS</p>
<p>A successful investor always knows about the events in the NFT world ahead of many others. Knowing about the future steps of an NFT project or knowing its release time always helps investors get ready for their next step in the NFT market. As you may already know, most of the profitable NFT collections sell out in a very short time and those who are not aware of the sale date and time lose the chance to get a precious NFT at the right time for a sale price. Besides, NFT owners may also miss an event set by an NFT developer team to get side advantages provided by their tokens. Follow the sites that provide the most comprehensive list of NFT events.</p>
<p>NFT Drops</p>
<p>An NFT drop refers to the release of a non-fungible token project with the exact date, time, and generally the minting price of the NFT. Since most NFT drops have purchase limits, investors can learn about the different aspects of the NFT drop earlier and make the best decisions for their purchase. As you may notice, purchasing at drop time is a great way to save money and no investor may want to lose this great chance. Therefore, get online with the most reliable NFT sites and get the latest news on NFT drops.</p>
<p>We hope that this article could be beneficial for all NFT investors out there. We suggest investors regularly check all sources introduced in this text to keep up to date with the NFT world and make the most profit.</p>

<p>Nature of NFTs</p>
<p>It is essential to learn not only about the nature of non-fungible tokens but also blockchain technology used with NFTs. The more you know about NFTs and about the technologies used with them, the better you can learn about the important factors to consider with NFT collections to choose from.</p>
<p>The developer team of an NFT collection</p>
<p>NFT investors always should learn about the development team of NFT collections. The future success of an NFT collection is directly related to its development team. Nobody wants to invest in a collection that its developers disappear after a while. Projects such as Ape Bored Yacht Club or Axi Infinity are strongly supported by developer teams that launch new collections from time to time and, as the result, add to the value of the tokens they released earlier.</p>
<p>Know the market flow</p>
<p>The next important item to consider for a safe and profitable investment in the NFT market is to know the flows in the market. You may find it almost impossible since it is a really huge market and nobody may get the time to check all NFT projects launched every week. Sure it is difficult, but not impossible! The NFT market provides a solution to almost all problems. The NFT market provides special tools to allow investors acquire the information they need to make an investment. Some practical tools include NFT Calendar that offers a time table to remind NFT events to investors, Rarity tools to calculate the rarity of NFT items, joining Discord servers to get the upcoming news and information about an NFT collection or its developer team, etc.</p>
<p>What should NFT investors follow to make a successful investment?</p>
<p>There are also other sources of information available for investors to keep update with the news in the NFT world. Along with joining Discords, investors also can follow the developer team&rsquo;s Twitter accounts and. Though, it is still much time-consuming to check for all details and news, especially if they keep a list of NFT collections to choose from. So, there should be a shorter way to get most of the news about NFT collections and events related to them.</p>
<p>As we already mentioned, there is always a solution to satisfy the investors in the NFT world. Here are the professional online NFT sites. Such sites are dedicated to all related to the NFT world, including NFT tutorials, NFT news and more importantly sections on NFT events and NFT drops. These professional NFT sites have gathered a team of professional experts in the field of NFTs and the Metaverse to provide the latest news on the NFT market not only weekly but also daily. See, things are getting easier when there are professional experts to analyze the NFT market, look for the most reliable NFT projects and write the latest news about them. These teams also watch the NFT brand movements and let the investors know about future events and possible drops that can be interesting to NFT investors.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s learn about the three major parts of NFT sites that definitely help investors to make the best decisions for their investments in the NFT world.</p>
<p>NFT NEWS</p>
<p>Well, it goes without saying that successful investors always need to follow the news to take the best advantage of their digital assets. Every movement of an NFT developer team or a celebrity in the world of NFTs may cause a wave in the market and change the flow of the market as well as the points of view of NFT investors. So, investors should always look for the most reliable NFT news sources.</p>
<p>NFT EVENTS</p>
<p>A successful investor always knows about the events in the NFT world ahead of many others. Knowing about the future steps of an NFT project or knowing its release time always helps investors get ready for their next step in the NFT market. As you may already know, most of the profitable NFT collections sell out in a very short time and those who are not aware of the sale date and time lose the chance to get a precious NFT at the right time for a sale price. Besides, NFT owners may also miss an event set by an NFT developer team to get side advantages provided by their tokens. Follow the sites that provide the most comprehensive list of NFT events.</p>
<p>NFT Drops</p>
<p>An NFT drop refers to the release of a non-fungible token project with the exact date, time, and generally the minting price of the NFT. Since most NFT drops have purchase limits, investors can learn about the different aspects of the NFT drop earlier and make the best decisions for their purchase. As you may notice, purchasing at drop time is a great way to save money and no investor may want to lose this great chance. Therefore, get online with the most reliable NFT sites and get the latest news on NFT drops.</p>
<p>We hope that this article could be beneficial for all NFT investors out there. We suggest investors regularly check all sources introduced in this text to keep up to date with the NFT world and make the most profit.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this week, Japan&rsquo;s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) approved a proposal that would exempt companies that issue cryptocurrencies from taxes on unrealized capital gains for tokens they retain on their books. </p>
<p>According to reports by Bloomberg, citing LDP party member Akihisa Shiozaki, approved a proposal that aims to improve business conditions for companies issuing cryptocurrencies. As it stands, Japanese cryptocurrency issuers are required to pay a set 30% corporate tax rate on their holdings, regardless of if they have realized a profit through the sale or not. The rather harsh tax rates have forced many domestically established crypto and blockchain firms to set up their operations elsewhere over the past few years.</p>
<p>Japan&rsquo;s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who became Prime Minister in September 2021, and his administration is expected to finalize its annual tax policy guidelines before the end of 2022 and the tax code amendments are then usually submitted to parliament in January. Following its submission to parliament in January, the softer crypto tax rules will go into effect for Japan&rsquo;s next financial year starting on April 1, 2023.</p>
<p>The proposed amendments to the tax code indicate that authorities are pursuing their earlier announced plans to remove some of the red tape on the cryptocurrency industry in an effort to encourage innovation and investment.</p>
<p>Kishida has been a vocal supporter of digital assets and blockchain adoption and recently announced additional investments in the non-fungible token (NFT) and metaverse industry. He emphasizes that NFTs, blockchain, and the metaverse will play an integral part in the nation&rsquo;s digital transformation giving the digitization of national identity cards as an example of this transformation.</p>
<p>According to reports by Cointelegraph, in October, the Japan Virtual and Crypto Asset Exchange Associated announced plans to relax the very strict screening process for listing new tokens on exchanges. Prime Minister Kishida reportedly called on the self-regulatory organization to do so in June.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) expanded its ecosystem by adding two crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) &ndash; the first of its kind in Asia. </p>
<p>Today, the HKEX listed two news ETFs: CSOP Bitcoin Futures and CSOP Ether Futures which are products that track cash-settled Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). According to reports by Reuters, the ETFs, both managed by CSOP Asset Management, invest in Bitcoin and Ether futures listed on the CME exchange in the United States, - the only cryptocurrency assets currently permitted by Hong Kong&rsquo;s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC).</p>
<p>Wilfred Yiu, HKEX&rsquo;s COO and co-head of markets said:</p>

<p>These ETFs &ldquo;provide investors with exposure to the digital asset space for the first time in Asia and reflect both our ongoing commitment to, and the market&rsquo;s appetite for, the digital economy.</p>

<p>HKEX indicated that ETFs are one of the fastest-growing segments in its products suite and the exchange has also announced plans to expand the diversity of its offerings. In 2022, the exchange supported the listings of the first metaverse ETF, carbon futures ETF, and blockchain ETF on the market according to reports by Tech In Asia.</p>
<p>Not long before the collapse of FTX, the SFC said that it would start consultations to allow retail investors to trade cryptos and ETFs, and had initially proposed restricting participation to professional investors.</p>
<p>Yi Wang, head of quantitative investment at CSOP said:</p>

<p>Coming after the recent liquidity problems affecting some of the crypto platforms, our two crypto futures ETFs demonstrate that Hong Kong remains open-minded on the development of virtual assets.</p>

<p>Wang further said:</p>

<p>As the ETFs do not invest in physical bitcoin and are traded on regulated U.S. and Hong Kong exchanges, there are more regulatory safeguards for investors compared to tokens traded on unregulated platforms.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft has updated its acceptable use policy to clarify that crypto mining is now banned unless prior approval is given.</p>
An updated policy
<p>In a move that was not publicised, Microsoft has quietly changed its Acceptable Use Policy to include the following statement:</p>

<p>"Neither Customer, nor those that access an Online Service through Customer, may use an Online Service: to mine cryptocurrency without Microsoft's prior written approval."</p>

<p>In an article first published by the global online tech publication The Register, it was reported that the only other notice of Microsoft's changed stance was given in a subsequent &lsquo;advisory&rsquo; that stated:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Acceptable Use Policy has been updated to explicitly prohibit mining for cryptocurrencies across all Microsoft Online Services unless written pre-approval is granted by Microsoft.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>It added:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We suggest seeking written pre-approval from Microsoft before using Microsoft Online Services for mining cryptocurrencies, regardless of the term of a subscription.&rdquo;</p>

Cloud mining becomes more restrictive
<p>Microsoft says that its action is designed to protect customers and to lessen risks of impaired services to its cloud services. However, it did also state that it may give access to mine crypto only if this is used for testing security of platforms.</p>
<p>Microsoft is not alone in prohibiting the mining of crypto through its cloud services. Google also requires a written approval request, while Oracle has banned it completely.</p>
Advantages of cloud mining
<p>Cloud mining is a great way to mine cryptocurrencies because it offers several advantages over traditional hardware-based mining. It is more cost-effective, as there are no upfront costs for hardware or maintenance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cloud mining also provides greater scalability and flexibility, as users can easily adjust their hash rate according to the current market conditions. Additionally, cloud mining allows users to access global pools of miners, which increases their chances of finding blocks and receiving rewards faster than with traditional methods.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, cloud mining provides a greater degree of anonymity and security than other methods due to its decentralised nature.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In light of the recent collapse of the crypto exchange FTX, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Roger Marshall have introduced the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act. The Act is aimed at the cryptocurrency industry and its proposed regulations have already elicited opinions from critics calling it &ldquo;opportunistic&rdquo; and &ldquo;unconstitutional.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The bill proposed by Senator Warren, a vocal critic of cryptocurrencies, and Senator Marshall, will place new know-your-customer (KYC) requirements on crypto network participants. Amid the United States Senate hearings regarding the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX, Senators Warren and Marshall introduced the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act targeting the cryptocurrency industry. The main aim of the bill is to place KYC requirements on blockchain infrastructure providers and participants in the U.S. The scope of the bill includes developers creating software for decentralised networks and even extends to the validators and miners that support such networks.</p>
Further KYC Requirements Would be Implemented
<p>The bill proposes that the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) treat cryptocurrency wallet service providers, validators, miners, and other network users as &ldquo;money service businesses (MSBs),&rdquo; thereby requiring KYC for participants as well as a requirement for anti-money laundering (AML) initiatives. As it stands, unhosted wallets, miners, and validators are not regarded as MSBs. In line with KYC requirements, it would require these entities to identify their customers and users and track their transactions. A similar rule was proposed by FinCEN in 2020 but was never implemented.</p>
Privacy Coins and &ldquo;Mixers&rdquo; Also Targeted
<p>The proposed bill also focuses on privacy coins and &ldquo;mixers&rdquo; which are used to conceal and obfuscate the origin and destination of digital asset transactions. Under the bill, &ldquo;financial institutions&rdquo; would be barred from &ldquo;handling, using, or transacting business&rdquo; with entities such as mixers and with digital assets that have interacted with such technologies. Mixers have recently been a great topic of discussion in the crypto space with the Ethereum mixer service, Tornado Cash, being banned by the U.S. Treasury via sanctions in August.</p>
<p>Senator Warren said in a statement:</p>

<p>The crypto industry should follow common-sense rules like banks, brokers, and Western Union, and this legislation would ensure the same standards apply across similar financial transactions. Adding, &ldquo;The bipartisan bill will help close crypto money laundering loopholes and strengthen enforcement to better safeguard U.S. national security.&rdquo;</p>

Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act Already Receives Scrutiny
<p>Warren and Marshall&rsquo;s proposed bill has already received significant scrutiny from the cryptocurrency industry. Crypto advocacy group Coin Center has condemned the bill as &ldquo;an opportunistic, unconstitutional assault on cryptocurrency self-custody, developers, and node operators.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Director of Research of Coin Center, Peter Van Valkenburgh posted made his opinion known on Twitter, saying:</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Senators Warren and Marshall's proposed bill subjecting software devs &amp; nodes to AML is "a repudiation of liberal values and a move towards the types of surveillance and control prized by authoritarians like Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping, and Kim Jong-un"https://t.co/s7pRKsWV2W</p>
&mdash; Peter Van Valkenburgh 🫡🦬🚲🌐🥐 | 🚫💳🕵️🌽🛢️🚗 (@valkenburgh) December 14, 2022
<p>

</p>
<p>He further opined:</p>

<p>The Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act is a direct attack on technological progress and also a direct attack on our personal privacy and autonomy.</p>

<p>Amid the carnage of collapsing crypto firms across the sector, Amber Group is looking to buck the trend with its recent funding raise which it announced this morning on Twitter.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">1) Today, we&rsquo;re announcing that Amber Group has completed a $300M Series-C round, led by Fenbushi Capital US and joined by other crypto-native investors and family offices.</p>
&mdash; Amber Group (@ambergroup_io) December 16, 2022
<p>

</p>
<p>Following on from the news that it had decided to end its partnership with the UK premiership&rsquo;s Chelsea Football Club, and had also cut its workforce by 40%, Amber Group has now received backing to go ahead and reinvigorate its business.</p>
<p>Amber also said on Twitter that it would be adapting to the changing demands in the crypto market.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">2) This new round of fundraising demonstrates investor confidence in Amber&rsquo;s business and the commitment to shape our future together. As part of that future, it's important for us to adapt and protect our clients in this challenging market environment.</p>
&mdash; Amber Group (@ambergroup_io) December 16, 2022
<p>

</p>
<p>It also announced that it had changed its fundraising strategy in order to continue attracting the investment and backing from its Series C investors.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">6) That&rsquo;s why we reacted quickly to adjust our fundraising strategy. The Series C investors came on board with the understanding that we will be laser-focused on providing best-in-class services to our client base of institutional and high-net-worth investors.</p>
&mdash; Amber Group (@ambergroup_io) December 16, 2022

</p>
<p>Amber has certainly had to cut its cloth in a major effort to remain at the forefront of crypto trading, and of providing liquidity and market-making services, mainly in Asia. Its valuation has decreased below the $3 billion figure it was valued at in February of this year.</p>
<p>With its renewed investment now received and a much leaner staff with which to do business, Amber Group will be hoping that 2023 will be a lot more positive as it focuses on its core business and clients.</p>

<p>About TRON DAO</p>
<p>TRON DAO is a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps.</p>
<p>Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of December 2022, it has over 129 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4.4 billion total transactions, and over $9.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government&rsquo;s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (&ldquo;DMC&rdquo;), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica&rsquo;s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao defended the cryptocurrency exchange during an interview with CNBC&rsquo;s Squawk Box, assuring that the exchange was financially sound.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CEO added that the exchange does not owe anyone money and has never misused or co-mingled client funds that it handles.&nbsp;</p>
Binance On Solid Ground&nbsp;
<p>Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao made an appearance on CNBC&rsquo;s Squawk Box and spoke at length about FTX, audits, the recent withdrawals on the exchange, and the $2.1 billion SBF buyout. He was also grilled about the recent pause in withdrawals, an unexpected move by the cryptocurrency exchange as it faced a surge in withdrawals, and about the exchange&rsquo;s solvency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Binance had temporarily halted withdrawals of the USDC stablecoin because of inadequate USDC reserves on the platform. Zhao stated that the problem was nothing major and was related to a New York bank the exchange uses to swap its Paxos-issued BUSD stablecoin into USDC, which was shut at the time. As a result, withdrawal requests could not be processed, but resumed shortly after..&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have the assets to convert. There&rsquo;s no margin; there&rsquo;s no leverage. We just needed the banks to open. When banks are closed, and you try to withdraw money, it doesn&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zhao also added that the exchange does not owe anyone money, has no outstanding loans, and has no venture capital investments. He added that the exchange was coping with customer withdrawal demand, stressing that no amount of withdrawals could strain the exchange&rsquo;s functioning.&nbsp;</p>
What About The FTX Clawback?&nbsp;
<p>Zhao also dismissed concerns that Binance may have $2.1 billion clawed back as a result of the FTX exchange&rsquo;s bankruptcy proceedings, stating that he trusted the company&rsquo;s lawyers to handle those proceedings. Binance had gotten the $2.1 billion payment from FTX when it exited its position in the exchange in 2019. There is speculation that the exchange may be asked to return this amount to bankruptcy trustees who may look to claw back any fraudulent conveyances made by FTX.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When pressed further, Zhao stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ll leave that to the lawyers. I think our legal team is perfectly capable of handling it.&rdquo;</p>

Big Four Audit?&nbsp;
<p>The CNBC team also pressed Zhao on the matter of an independent audit by any of the reputable &ldquo;Big Four&rdquo; accounting firms and why Binance had not done that yet. Zhao responded by admitting that they have not been in talks with the Big Four firm. However, he added that a lot of the more reputable auditing companies are hesitant to work with crypto businesses and exchanges because of the FTX debacle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He also added that most auditing companies could not audit crypto businesses properly, but he is willing to work with competent auditors. He also defended Binance&rsquo;s EARN program, stating that funds used there are for other margin traders to borrow from.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes we do run out because the demand supply sometimes doesn&rsquo;t match up, but the money never leaves the platform, and we do margin controls.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Former president of the United States of America, Donald Trump, has unveiled an NFT collection on his official Truth Social account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The collection features the former president in a number of avatars, such as a superhero, an astronaut, and a Nascar racing driver.&nbsp;</p>
The Donald Trump NFT Collection&nbsp;
<p>Donald Trump has added another feather to his cap. The former president, known for launching branded products, has now launched an exclusive NFT collection. Mr. Trump had triggered considerable speculation earlier in the week when he stated that he would be making a &ldquo;major announcement.&rdquo; Many expected him to name a running mate for his presidential campaign. Instead, Mr. Trump announced the launch of the exclusive NFT collection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The collection features Mr. Trump in several avatars, such as an astronaut and a Nascar driver. Mr. Trump stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These limited edition cards feature amazing ART of my Life &amp; Career. It would make a great Christmas gift. Don&rsquo;t Wait. They will be gone, I believe, very quickly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Trump posted a clip featuring an animated version of himself in front of the Trump Tower in New York. The character rips open his shirt, revealing a superhero costume emblazoned with the letter T, as lasers shoot out from his eyes. The cards were described as similar to baseball cards but much more exciting. The NFTs will be priced at $99 each, and buyers will also be able to enter a sweepstake and stand the chance of winning a gala dinner or a game of golf with Mr. Trump.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The NFTs will be minted on the Polygon blockchain, with 45,000 NFTs created during the initial run of the collection, according to its official website.&nbsp;</p>
Move Roundly Criticized&nbsp;
<p>Mr. Trump&rsquo;s announcement was roundly criticized across social media, with several high-profile Republicans also speaking out. Right-wing media commentator and former chief strategist for Mr. Trump, Steve Bannon, stated on his podcast,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do this anymore. Anyone involved in the project &ldquo;ought to be fired today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden, taking a jibe at Mr. Trump, stated on Twitter that he had a few major announcements of his own.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had some MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENTS the last couple of weeks, too&hellip; Inflation&rsquo;s easing. I just signed the Respect for Marriage Act. We brought Brittney Griner home Gas prices are lower than a year ago 10,000 new high-paying jobs in Arizona.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Others speculated that the NFT collection was to help fund the numerous legal battles that Mr. Trump is currently facing. The official website for the collection states that the funds generated through the collection would not be used towards the presidential campaign.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These Digital Trading Cards are not political and have nothing to do with any political campaign. NFT INT LLC is not owned, managed, or controlled by Donald J. Trump, The Trump Organization, CIC Digital LLC, or any of their respective principals or affiliates.&rdquo;</p>

Previously Critical Of Crypto&nbsp;

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former president of the United States of America, Donald Trump, has unveiled an NFT collection on his official Truth Social account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The collection features the former president in a number of avatars, such as a superhero, an astronaut, and a Nascar racing driver.&nbsp;</p>
The Donald Trump NFT Collection&nbsp;
<p>Donald Trump has added another feather to his cap. The former president, known for launching branded products, has now launched an exclusive NFT collection. Mr. Trump had triggered considerable speculation earlier in the week when he stated that he would be making a &ldquo;major announcement.&rdquo; Many expected him to name a running mate for his presidential campaign. Instead, Mr. Trump announced the launch of the exclusive NFT collection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The collection features Mr. Trump in several avatars, such as an astronaut and a Nascar driver. Mr. Trump stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These limited edition cards feature amazing ART of my Life &amp; Career. It would make a great Christmas gift. Don&rsquo;t Wait. They will be gone, I believe, very quickly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Trump posted a clip featuring an animated version of himself in front of the Trump Tower in New York. The character rips open his shirt, revealing a superhero costume emblazoned with the letter T, as lasers shoot out from his eyes. The cards were described as similar to baseball cards but much more exciting. The NFTs will be priced at $99 each, and buyers will also be able to enter a sweepstake and stand the chance of winning a gala dinner or a game of golf with Mr. Trump.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The NFTs will be minted on the Polygon blockchain, with 45,000 NFTs created during the initial run of the collection, according to its official website.&nbsp;</p>
Move Roundly Criticized&nbsp;
<p>Mr. Trump&rsquo;s announcement was roundly criticized across social media, with several high-profile Republicans also speaking out. Right-wing media commentator and former chief strategist for Mr. Trump, Steve Bannon, stated on his podcast,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do this anymore. Anyone involved in the project &ldquo;ought to be fired today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden, taking a jibe at Mr. Trump, stated on Twitter that he had a few major announcements of his own.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had some MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENTS the last couple of weeks, too&hellip; Inflation&rsquo;s easing. I just signed the Respect for Marriage Act. We brought Brittney Griner home Gas prices are lower than a year ago 10,000 new high-paying jobs in Arizona.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Others speculated that the NFT collection was to help fund the numerous legal battles that Mr. Trump is currently facing. The official website for the collection states that the funds generated through the collection would not be used towards the presidential campaign.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These Digital Trading Cards are not political and have nothing to do with any political campaign. NFT INT LLC is not owned, managed, or controlled by Donald J. Trump, The Trump Organization, CIC Digital LLC, or any of their respective principals or affiliates.&rdquo;</p>

Previously Critical Of Crypto&nbsp;
<p>Donald Trump has previously held not-so-favorable views about the crypto space and digital assets. He stated that he was very wary of Bitcoin because of the threat posed to the US Dollar, going as far as to say that he viewed the world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency as a scam.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Brazilian central bank is looking to launch its digital currency in 2024 following a closed pilot program next year in collaboration with financial institutions. </p>
<p>The Central Bank of Brazil will launch its digital currency in 2024 according to the bank&rsquo;s president Roberto Campos Neto. Compos Neto spoke at an event hosted by the news website Poder 360, in which he said the project has garnered a lot of international attention. He added that the design of the central bank&rsquo;s digital currency would encourage banks to tokenize their assets, with considerable efficiency gains according to reports by Reuters. He said:</p>

<p>If the digital currency is actually a tokenized deposit, it inherits all the regulation that already applies to deposits.</p>

<p>Campos Neto also added that the project should not disturb monetary policy or hurt banks&rsquo; balance sheets. According to the central bank&rsquo;s president, representative of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have approached the bank and has provided feedback indicating that this model seems the simplest to implement and that other central banks should consider looking into implementing the same model. He added:</p>

<p>In the end, we were even flattered to have thought of a system that other central banks are now thinking of.</p>

<p>The benefits of a digital currency should be to improve the banks&rsquo; settlement, auditing, and funding costs according to Campos Neto. He further predicted a jump in the use of the bank&rsquo;s popular instant payment system, Pix, and this will be achieved when users can access cheaper credit through the system without a fee &ndash; a system known as the merchant discount rate (MDR) which merchants pay to companies that supply credit card machines. Pix was launched in November 2020 and is free for individuals, although the system lets banks and payment institutions freely define merchant&rsquo;s costs for receiving and transferring funds.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Upside Momentum Rallies:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 16 December 2022</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) sought to reclaim recent upside progress early in the Asian session as the pair moderated after recently peaking around the 18385.36 level, its strongest print since early November.&nbsp; Stops were elected below the 17694.98 level during the pullback, representing the 23.6% retracement of the recent broader appreciating range from 15460 to 18385.36.&nbsp; &nbsp;Additional retracement levels in this appreciating range include the 17267.87, 16922.68, 16577.49, 16150.38, and 16086.03.&nbsp; &nbsp;Risk aversion has been reduced in recent days and traders have been able to propel BTC/USD to multi-week highs after Stops were elected above the 17779.81 and 17872.75 levels.&nbsp; Additional technically significant upside retracement levels include the 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp; Following recent gains from two-year lows around the 15460 area, areas of potential technical support and buying pressure include the 17400.55, 17029.71, 16730, 16430.28, 16059.44, and 16003.56 areas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, the 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Below these areas, technically significant levels include the 14613, 14500.15, 13369, 10432.73, 10727, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 200-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 17220.71 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 17757.07.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;14500.15/ 13369.11/ 10727.75 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;18495.40/ 19199.48/ 20070.64 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bearishly below SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bullishly above MACDAverage.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The incoming chairperson of the UK&rsquo;s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) stated that under his leadership, the crypto industry would have to face a lot more scrutiny and regulation.&nbsp;</p>
&ldquo;Crypto Facilitates Money Laundering&rdquo;&nbsp;
<p>Ashley Alder, who is set to lead the UK financial watchdog, has called for tighter crypto regulation in the country. He has claimed that crypto firms facilitate money laundering and therefore need increased oversight. Speaking to parliament membersat a cross-party Treasury select committee, Adler stated that crypto platforms are deliberately evasive about providing clarity and thus create risk for customer funds like conflicts of interest and unsegregated asset holdings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He said,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our experience to date of [crypto] platforms, whether FTX or others, is that they are deliberately evasive; they are a method by which money laundering happens in size. [Crypto firms] bundle a whole set of activities which are normally segregated&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;. gives rise to massively untoward risk.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

FCA And Government At Odds Over Crypto
<p>Adler's comments and approach toward crypto are in stark contrast to the government&rsquo;s plans for the country&rsquo;s crypto industry. The U.K. government has in the past sought to establish a high-quality global crypto hub that fosters innovation and development in the industry. The goal has remained constant through the turbulent changing of the guards, where both former PM Liz Truss and current PM Rishi Sunak have maintained pro-crypto stances.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However the FCA has been holding on to its rigid stance against the industry. The regulatory body had conducted anti-money laundering tests, which eliminated 85% of the firms that applied for the license.&nbsp;</p>
FCA Previous Leadership
<p>The previous chair of the FCA, Charles Randell had also worked on imposing tight regulations on the industry. In March, the agency wrote to UK-based crypto exchanges and put pressure on them to comply with regulations, especially sanction laws against Russian accounts. This was after both Binance and Kraken had initially refused to implement the sanctions and refused to block Russian accounts. Soon after, in May, Randell spoke at length on the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies and questioned their legitimacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He said,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the price of Bitcoin can readily halve within six months, as it has done recently, and some other speculative crypto tokens have gone to zero&hellip; should people without any significant savings or financial experience be encouraged or permitted to buy speculative crypto at all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both Randell and Adler&rsquo;s comments and the overall changing views of the financial watchdog spell trouble for the crypto firms hoping to establish themselves in the United Kingdom.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s3">There&rsquo;s no question that Cardano (ADA) and Polkadot (DOT) are among the most prominent tokens in the industry. Both tokens grew in stature after smart contract platforms were among the most popular investments in the last epic bull run of 2021. However, since then, the market downturn arising from the FTX fallout has seen their values hit yearly all-time lows.</p>
<p class="s3">Not surprisingly, investors are queuing up for the Flasko presale, a revolutionary alternative investment platform that analysts believe can do a 5,000% increase from its current presale price of $0.111 in the coming year.</p>
<p class="s3">Cardano (ADA) Continues on its Downward Trend</p>
<p class="s3">Cardano (ADA) Active address usage on the Cardano (ADA) network has increased dramatically by 90% daily. It has been reported that there are now over 1.2 million allocated wallets on the blockchain.</p>
<p class="s3">The price of ADA has decreased by 5% during the past week. The current price of Cardano is $0.304558. After Cardano (ADA) couldn't break its recent resistance at $0.44, analysts expected $0.32 to be the support. Still, the price of Cardano (ADA) fell further to its current $0.30 alongside the broad cryptocurrency market. Investors believe that if the price of Cardano (ADA) cannot hold the $0.30 price position, then a continuous fall would be expected. </p>
<p class="s3">Polkadot (DOT) Struggling With Extremely Bearish Market Conditions</p>
<p class="s3">Polkadot (DOT) is known for its growing development activity on its blockchain, but that hasn&rsquo;t exactly translated to Polkadot (DOT) token price increasing. It&rsquo;s a good thing to have social and dev activity as they are indicators of popularity, but Polkadot (DOT) has been slipping -2.0% over the past week. Currently, Polkadot (DOT) is trading at $5.29.</p>
<p class="s3">Daily charts show a torrid time for Polkadot (DOT) investors, as indicators pointed to prolonged bearish conditions in succeeding days. Investors may find more value in buying into projects with greater potential to make serious gains.</p>
<p class="s3">Experts Predict Flasko (FLSK) To Surge 4,000% In The Coming Months</p>
<p class="s3">Flasko is creating the first alternative investment platform combining non-fungible technology with the rare wines, whiskeys, and champagnes asset class. This allows Flasko NFT holders to take advantage of the potential of alternative investments as a hedge against inflation due to their scarcity and increasing value. </p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="s3">There&rsquo;s no question that Cardano (ADA) and Polkadot (DOT) are among the most prominent tokens in the industry. Both tokens grew in stature after smart contract platforms were among the most popular investments in the last epic bull run of 2021. However, since then, the market downturn arising from the FTX fallout has seen their values hit yearly all-time lows.</p>
<p class="s3">Not surprisingly, investors are queuing up for the Flasko presale, a revolutionary alternative investment platform that analysts believe can do a 5,000% increase from its current presale price of $0.111 in the coming year.</p>
<p class="s3">Cardano (ADA) Continues on its Downward Trend</p>
<p class="s3">Cardano (ADA) Active address usage on the Cardano (ADA) network has increased dramatically by 90% daily. It has been reported that there are now over 1.2 million allocated wallets on the blockchain.</p>
<p class="s3">The price of ADA has decreased by 5% during the past week. The current price of Cardano is $0.304558. After Cardano (ADA) couldn't break its recent resistance at $0.44, analysts expected $0.32 to be the support. Still, the price of Cardano (ADA) fell further to its current $0.30 alongside the broad cryptocurrency market. Investors believe that if the price of Cardano (ADA) cannot hold the $0.30 price position, then a continuous fall would be expected. </p>
<p class="s3">Polkadot (DOT) Struggling With Extremely Bearish Market Conditions</p>
<p class="s3">Polkadot (DOT) is known for its growing development activity on its blockchain, but that hasn&rsquo;t exactly translated to Polkadot (DOT) token price increasing. It&rsquo;s a good thing to have social and dev activity as they are indicators of popularity, but Polkadot (DOT) has been slipping -2.0% over the past week. Currently, Polkadot (DOT) is trading at $5.29.</p>
<p class="s3">Daily charts show a torrid time for Polkadot (DOT) investors, as indicators pointed to prolonged bearish conditions in succeeding days. Investors may find more value in buying into projects with greater potential to make serious gains.</p>
<p class="s3">Experts Predict Flasko (FLSK) To Surge 4,000% In The Coming Months</p>
<p class="s3">Flasko is creating the first alternative investment platform combining non-fungible technology with the rare wines, whiskeys, and champagnes asset class. This allows Flasko NFT holders to take advantage of the potential of alternative investments as a hedge against inflation due to their scarcity and increasing value. </p>
<p class="s3">Flasko holders also stand to gain exclusive discounts and deals from Flasko-approved partners in the luxury beverages sector on its Flasko Launchpad. </p>
<p class="s3">With Flasko token prices available at $0.111 and widely predicted by eagle-eyed experts to do a 50x to $5 by 2023, Flasko might very well be the presale event of the season.</p>
<p class="s3">While Cardano (ADA) and Polkadot (DOT) may have some interesting action in the coming year, experts believe that Flasko will outperform both tokens in price action, considering Flasko is just about to list on Uniswap. Moreover, with its fully-audited smart contract by Solid Proof, locks on platform liquidity for 33 years, and on dev team token allocations (with another 3 years vesting), Flasko has done the necessary to secure its future success.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s7">Seldom do we hear that a new crypto project has been able to make a big impact in the market. However, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is one of the rare projects that has stormed crypto enthusiasts and market analysts with its massive 655% growth rate thus far. Meanwhile, projects like FTX Token (FTT) and Ripple (XRP) have fallen to the ground due to current bearish market conditions.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s11">FTX Token&rsquo;s (FTT) Volatility Scares Investors</p>
<p class="s7">FTX Token (FTT) has been experiencing extreme volatility in the last few weeks. While on some days, it has posted an intra-day gain of around 30%, on others, it dipped severely. Noticeably, the price of FTX Token (FTT) has declined by around 95% in just one month. This severe fall has made investors wary about FTX Token&rsquo;s (FTT) stability.</p>
<p class="s7">FTX Token (FTT) is a centralized, blockchain-powered crypto derivatives exchange. FTX Token (FTT) was developed to offer futures, leveraged tokens, and over-the-counter trading. FTX Token (FTT), launched in 2019, has the main goal of solving the shortcomings of the futures exchanges. FTX Token (FTT) aims to establish itself as one of the best crypto derivatives exchanges. FTT is the native crypto of the FTX Token (FTT) ecosystem.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s11">Investors Pumped By Historic Success Of Orbeon Protocol&rsquo;s (ORBN) Pre-Sale</p>
<p class="s7">Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is a blockchain-based decentralized platform that caters to the needs of the venture capital and crowdfunding industry. Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) creates digital tokenized versions of shares issued by companies in the form of fractional NFTs, which can be purchased by individual investors for as low as $1. Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) enables businesses to raise funds by offering equity-based NFTs.</p>
<p class="s7">Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) has disrupted the traditional fundraising process and helps both businesses and investors. For companies, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) has come up with NFTs-as-service (NFTaas), making the fundraising process quicker and less expensive.</p>
<p class="s7">Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) offers two major benefits to investors. First, the platform lists only promising real-world companies. Second, the platform eliminates the possibility of scams by integrating a &ldquo;Fill or Kill&rdquo; safety mechanism in its smart contract. The safety mechanism ensures that investors get their invested amount back if the fundraising process fails.</p>
<p class="s7">ORBN is the native crypto that runs the Orbeon ecosystem, which has four elements: OrbeonExchange, Orbeon Swap, Orbeon Wallet, and Metaverse. ORBN tokens also offer many benefits to holders, including discounts on trading fees, cashback rewards, and the right to vote on key resolutions.</p>
<p class="s7">The third phase of ORBN tokens&rsquo; pre-sale has begun after the first phase registered a massive success, posting gains of 260%. The trading price of ORBN tokens, which was $0.004 at the time of launch, has now reached $0.0302. It is also expected to reach $0.24 before the pre-sale ends. Market analysts have predicted that the value of ORBN tokens will increase by 6000% during the pre-sale phase.</p>

<p class="s11">Ripple (XRP) Struggles To Cover Its Losses</p>
<p class="s7">Ripple (XRP) is a blockchain platform built to facilitate cross-border and cross-platform fund transfers. Ripple&rsquo;s native crypto, XRP, was launched as a faster, cost-effective, and scalable digital asset that can simplify payments. Ripple (XRP) was developed to facilitate exchange between various cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies.</p>
<p class="s7">Most cryptocurrencies have suffered a loss in value in the last month, and Ripple (XRP) is no exception to that. The price of Ripple (XRP) has fallen by 21% in the last 30 days. In the past week, Ripple&rsquo;s (XRP) price has plunged by 4%. Currently, Ripple (XRP) is being traded at $0.39, which is 90% below its all-time high of $3.84.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Finding a cryptocurrency that may bring you profit in 2023 is very difficult.
