<p>Ryan Selkis, the co-founder and CEO of Messari, recently published his 2023 Crypto Theses report where he looks at key trends and his predictions for the coming year.</p>
<p>Selkis writes his reports on an annual basis, and this is the sixth consecutive Messari Theses Report. He starts with stating that while cryptocurrency portfolios are down 80% since the last report, the question is:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this the dark before the dawn, or the beginning of a long Arctic winter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He outlines that both Bitcoin and Ethereum appear to be &ldquo;on long-term stable ground&rdquo;, and that &ldquo;DeFi will take major strides forward next year.&rdquo; He believes that privacy tech will either be integrated into public blockchains, or that it will be banned on &ldquo;dystopian and vague &ldquo;national security&rdquo; grounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He also gives his view of the following:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Infrastructure investments around code security, decentralised hardware, virtual worlds, custody, protocol governance, and blockchain scalability are all in vogue. There will be less NFT speculation. Fewer moon fumes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He says that there is a certain amount of &ldquo;rage&rdquo; that fuels the report, given all the bad actors in crypto that have hogged the stage and set back the years of progress of the good actors.</p>
<p>He includes a short tweet thread in the report, which sums up how he feels about crypto today:</p>
<p></p>
<p>The report is split into 2 parts: the first part is titled &ldquo;What H-A-P-P-E-N-E-D in 2022&rdquo;. Very likely a humorous reference to a certain tweet by Sam Bankman-Fried.</p>
<p>The second part of the report is titled &ldquo;Why crypto matters in 2023&rdquo;. He begins this with a tribute to Hal Finney for being a visionary who had inspired and motivated him.</p>
<p>Selkis writes with integrity and honesty when he says of Bitcoin that it has &ldquo;big carbon footprints&rdquo;, but then writes of it:</p>

<p>&ldquo;as a single purpose, commodity money, and secure settlement system, it has held up miraculously. It has proven durability and will continue to serve as a powerful check on absolute sovereign authority&rdquo;</p>

<p>The rest of the report is more on Bitcoin, Privacy Coins, Stablecoins, and finally a chapter on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and their dystopian character.</p>
