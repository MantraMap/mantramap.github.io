			            <description><![CDATA[CBDCs will require global interoperability to work best, according to the International Monetary Fund. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is working on a global platform to make the Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) launched by numerous world governments more interoperable, reported Reuters on Monday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The agency believes widespread agreement on such a platform may be necessary to ensure that private market cryptocurrencies don’t fill its functional vacuum. </span></p>
<h2>Preparing for a World of CBDCs</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/imf-working-global-central-bank-digital-currency-platform-2023-06-19/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> on Monday that the agency’s platform is intended to enable CBDC transactions between countries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;CBDCs should not be fragmented national propositions,” Georgieva told African central banks at a conference in Rabat, Morocco. “To have more efficient and fairer transactions we need systems that connect countries: we need interoperability,&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“For this reason at the IMF, we are working on the concept of a global CBDC platform,&#8221; she added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A CBDC is a digitally native currency issued by a central bank, much like traditional fiat currencies. They may be backed by fiat currency or other assets like gold, or treated as an equivalent of those assets by the central bank. Georgieva emphasized that when cryptocurrencies are not designed in this manner, they are “speculative investments.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some of the purported </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/exploring-cbdcs-crucial-social-experiment-or-digital-enslavement/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">benefits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> of CBDCs include promoting financial inclusion and reducing </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/imf-chief-cbdcs-could-be-safer-and-cheaper-than-cryptocurrencies/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">payment costs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Average remittance fees are currently 6.3%, amounting to $44 billion per year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;If countries develop CDBCs only for domestic deployment we are underutilizing their capacity,&#8221; she added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Managing Director noted that there are already 114 countries exploring CBDCs in some capacity, with 10 “already crossing the finish line.” Many are still in early stages, however, with countries like the United States and Canada continuing to question whether or not developing one is worth it.</span></p>
<h2>Opposing Private Cryptos</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Classic decentralized cryptos like Bitcoin have also been praised as a potential tool for cheaper remittances. El Salvador made Bitcoin legal tender in 2021 and launched its state-sponsored </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/nayib-bukele-chivo-bitcoin-wallet-has-now-more-active-users-than-any-salvadorian-bank/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">Chivo wallet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> with a primary focus on this benefit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The IMF has never been a fan of El Salvador’s Bitcoin adoption, however, for fear that the asset’s currency status could destabilize the economy. El Salvador President Nayib Bukele continues to </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/president-bukele-bites-back-as-el-salvador-snubs-imfs-advice-to-stop-using-bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">snub</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> their advice. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Private stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and Circle’s USDC have also come under scrutiny for their ability to depeg, and the risks surrounding their reserves. In a five-point crypto regulation scheme the IMF recommended earlier this year, it noted that stablecoin issuers should be regulated like banks. </span></p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The cryptocurrency payments company – Wyre &#8211; announced it will cease operations, citing current &#8220;market conditions.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The firm has gone through several ups and downs in the past few years, with its main problems starting in 2023 due to the ongoing uncertainty in the digital asset market. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The San Francisco-based crypto entity said it will no longer provide its services, blaming the current challenging times in the finance sector. The move aims to &#8220;protect the best interest of our key stakeholders and customers&#8221; and has nothing to do with the US SEC crackdown or other regulatory hurdles, Wyre explained.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">After nearly a decade, Wyre is winding down. Due to market conditions, we made this decision to protect the best interest of our key stakeholders and customers. This decision is not due to any regulatory agency direction. Wyre continues to secure customer assets.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<ul>
<li>The firm said clients can withdraw their assets via Wyre&#8217;s dashboard until July 14. Those who fail to do so will be subject to a separate program to recover their remaining funds. &#8220;We will post details on the process on our website and blog,&#8221; Wyre assured.</li>
<li>Found in 2013, the company gained steam in 2021 when it <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/wyre-partners-with-polygon-to-offer-usdc-to-customers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">teamed up</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> with Polygon. The partnership allowed developers to provide access to USDC to customers of the layer 2 blockchain network. </span></li>

It is worth noting that the transaction did not involve a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC).</span></li>
<li>The start of 2023, though, was not that successful. Wyre disclosed it was changing some of its policies on January 8 and <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/crypto-payments-platform-wyre-imposes-withdrawal-limits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">imposed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> withdrawal limits a day later. </span></li>

			            <description><![CDATA[The platform maintained it is not involved in a "controversial practice."]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges &#8211; Crypto.com &#8211; was recently rumored to have conducted proprietary trading, whereas some of its teams might have traded assets for profit. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company rejected the accusations, asserting it has adopted best practices to operate in the industry.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Crypto.com Under Fire</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Five people with direct knowledge of the matter supposedly <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b5d2bf4b-225c-4f30-9f1c-cbe8dc762fa8" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">told</a> Financial Times that the cryptocurrency platform had deployed internal teams to engage in illegal activities, including proprietary trading. One of the individuals revealed that Crypto.com executives made employees sign &#8220;sworn statements&#8221; that the firm is not involved in such actions. They were also asked to &#8220;say there is no internal market maker type operation.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Another person claimed that the proprietary trading desk functions on the firm&#8217;s platform and has spread to separate venues. The team in charge of that operation aims to make money &#8220;and not facilitate an exchange,&#8221; they added.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Crypto.com said it has never urged its staff to lie to other market participants. It also assured that most of its revenue comes from its application for retail traders.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;As such, the Crypto.com trading team ensures that Crypto.com is risk neutral by hedging these positions on a number of venues, including the Crypto.com exchange,&#8221; the entity stated. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The exchange dismissed the claims that its market-making unit attempts to boost liquidity. Instead, its priority is to &#8220;continuously improve order book liquidity and lowering spreads as it results in a more efficient market for all participants.&#8221; Subsequently, it guaranteed that all participants, including market makers, &#8220;are treated equally.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This is yet another problem that the exchange has to cope with. The war the US SEC waged on the cryptocurrency sector has affected Crypto.com, too, which </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.thestreet.com/cryptocurrency/crypto-com-shuts-down-u-s-crypto-exchange-after-sec-lawsuits-target-industry" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">said</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> it will stop serving institutional clients in the States from June 21.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Coinbase&#8217;s Case</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Rumors spread across the community last September </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-hired-wall-street-traders-to-test-proprietary-trading-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">indicated</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that Coinbase also engaged in proprietary trading.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Individuals, whose identities remained undisclosed, maintained that the exchange hired Wall Street traders in 2021 and established a unit whose purpose was to use the firm&#8217;s own funds to trade and stake digital currencies. They added that the division carried out a $100 million transaction to test the operation.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A Coinbase spokesperson disagreed with the allegations, affirming that the group was created to facilitate &#8220;client-driven cryptocurrency transactions&#8221; and not conduct illegal activities. The company&#8217;s CFO &#8211; Alesia Haas &#8211; also dismissed the claims:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Coinbase is an agency-only platform. We do not engage in proprietary trading on our </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">platform.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>

			            <description><![CDATA[Attributing it to leaked documents, users on social media have made these claims over the past few days. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">ChatGPT has been all the rage since its launch in November 2022, and updates, particularly access to GPT-4 version for ChatGPT Plus paid subscribers, have kept it in the news throughout the period so far. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The AI-powered Chatbot may soon have several additional features, including collaborative and connected workspaces. Additionally, users can upload files along with their questions. These upgrades will make the Chatbot provide more accurate and intelligent responses.</span></p>
<h2>Upcoming Features</h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">These details have come out on social media and some news platforms, attributing the information to<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/144cfzg/upcoming_chatgpt_features_file_uploading_profiles/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"> leaked</a> ChatGPT documents.    </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Thanks to the additional feature, the AI platform can handle more complex questions as its comprehension of the problems would significantly increase with the additional and detailed information provided through the files. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Letting users upload their profiles can help the Chatbot provide more personalized responses based on age, education, preferences, and geo-location. It can substantially improve the overall user experience on the platform. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Online workspaces allow teams spread over different locations to work together and collaborate on a single platform in real-time. There are several big companies in this space, including Salesforce and Hubspot. ChatGPT, with all the buzz and curiosity it has generated, will likely intensify the competition in this space.</span></p>
<h2>For Crypto, too</h2>
<p>As Open AI’s CEO Sam Altman is also helming a crypto-focused project &#8212; Worldcoin &#8212; and has recently secured a Series C <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/115m-for-worldcoin-secured-chatgpt-openai-ceo-closes-successful-fundraiser/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">funding</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> of $115 million, led by Blockchain Capital and backed by the likes of a16z, Bain Capital, and Distributed Global, any positive news about ChatGPT is undoubtedly going to enthuse the crypto community.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Since ChatGPT provides detailed answers that the AI prepares after scrutinizing millions of internet pages, the crypto community has been using it to find answers to some of the perennial questions: will Ethereum <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/will-ethereum-flip-bitcoin-we-put-chatgpt-and-googles-bard-against-each-other/" data-wpel-link="internal">fillip</a> bitcoin, what is the future of <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/we-asked-chatgpt-what-is-the-future-of-meme-coins-like-doge-shib-and-pepe-heres-the-answer/" data-wpel-link="internal">memecoin</a>, bitcoin and <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/chatgpt-has-a-big-misconception-about-bitcoins-ath-price/" data-wpel-link="internal">$100k milestone</a>, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The answers are intelligent as they often refer to uncertainties and different factors that play a role. These are valuable information, nevertheless, for new investors and traders. </span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[JPMorgan analysts believe the revelations made in the documents could drive other cryptocurrencies to look like ETH and become more decentralized.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Analysts at American multinational financial services giant JPMorgan said in a report that the Hinman documents released last week in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s legal tussle with the blockchain payments firm Ripple would likely trigger more decentralization in the crypto realm.</p>
<p>The research report, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/19/hinman-documents-release-in-sec-ripple-case-is-a-boost-to-ether-jpmorgan/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">seen</a> by CoinDesk, further noted that the documents provide a significant advantage for ether (ETH), the second largest crypto asset by market cap.</p>
<h2>A Boost for Ether</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://pacer.login.uscourts.gov/csologin/login.jsf?pscCourtId=NYSDC&amp;appurl=https://ecf.nysd.uscourts.gov/doc1/127133515096" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Hinman documents</a> are internal messages and emails related to former Director of Corporation Finance William Hinman’s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speech-hinman-061418" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">2018 speech</a> on ETH being akin to a commodity. Hinman said then ETH did not look like a security even though it may have started as one. He explained that such assets could become commodities once sufficiently decentralized.</p>
<p>On June 13, Ripple used statements in the documents to defend the SEC’s allegations in the ongoing lawsuit. Since December 2020, the U.S. regulator has insisted that the sale of XRP – the network’s native token – was an unregistered securities offering, as it met the criteria required to pass the Howey test.</p>
<p>Over time, Ripple has <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-obtains-hinman-documents-optimistic-about-sec-case/" data-wpel-link="internal">stood</a> its ground on XRP not being a security. The firm asserted that the token was sold in the same manner as ETH when founded and, thus, should be recognized as a commodity too. Both parties have <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-obtains-hinman-documents-optimistic-about-sec-case/" data-wpel-link="internal">submitted</a> several motions, making it difficult for the court to pass a verdict.</p>
<p>The JPMorgan analysts, led by Nikolas Panigirtzoglou, said SEC officials have admitted that the presence of tokens on a “sufficiently decentralized network,” which cannot be classified as securities, creates a regulatory gap.</p>
<p>According to the report, the Hinman speech recognizes another category of assets that are not securities “because there is no controlling group (at least in the Howey sense).&#8221; The analysts believe that a need for regulation to protect investors may arise.</p>
<p>The financial services company suggested that the SEC’s discoveries could be why the agency has not taken any enforcement action against ETH despite the intense scrutiny of other tokens this year.</p>
<h2>Triggering More Decentralization</h2>
<p>Furthermore, the report noted that the revelations made in the documents could drive other cryptocurrencies to look like ETH and become more decentralized, as more decentralization would reduce a digital asset’s chance of being recognized as a security.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The Hinman documents are likely to influence the direction of the current U.S. congressional effort to regulate the crypto industry in a way that ether would avoid being designated as a security,” the analysts wrote.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Key Support levels: $0.24</strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Resistance levels: $0.29</strong></p>
<p>The weekly price for ADA shows a 7% loss. However, sellers appear to have lost interest since the crash on June 10th and have failed to take the price lower. With good support at 24 cents, bulls may have an opportunity to push ADA higher in the coming days.</p>

<p><strong>Trading Volume: </strong>The volume crashed in the past few days. It appears that sellers don&#8217;t have the strength to continue the downtrend right now. This provides an opportunity for a reversal.</p>
<p><strong>RSI</strong>: The daily RSI is in the oversold area of under 30 points since June 9th. While this is bearish, it could also mean that ADA may soon leave this area to attempt a breakout.</p>
<p><strong>MACD</strong>: The daily MACD is bearish, but the histogram is making higher lows. If this continues, a reversal appears likely.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<p>The bias for ADA is bearish.</p>
<h2>Short-Term Prediction for ADA Price</h2>
<p>ADA is in desperate need of a relief rally that has been delayed for days after its sharp drop last week. This exhaustion from sellers could soon turn into an opportunity for bulls to take the price to the key resistance at 29 cents.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The meme coin space is constantly evolving – and 4-CHAN (4CHAN) is the latest token to experience significant price growth.</p>
<p>4CHAN has soared by 306% in the past four days, with many investors speculating that it could be the next meme coin to go viral, following in the footsteps of Pepe and Wojak.</p>
<p>Investors are also paying attention to the new Wall Street Memes (WSM) token, which has now raised an incredible $8.4 million during its presale phase.</p>
<h2>4-CHAN Token Receives a New Lease on Life Amid Market Volatility</h2>
<p>The 4-CHAN token was launched on May 2, when the meme coin mania was at its peak.</p>
<p>After a massive pump upon launch, which saw the price rise over 7,300%, the 4-CHAN price immediately retraced – and has been trading sideways ever since.</p>
<p>The lack of price momentum has led meme coin lovers to declare that 4-CHAN&#8217;s heyday was behind it. However, the recent value surge has given the token a new lease on life and rekindled investor interest.</p>
<p>Data from DEXTools.io <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0x4ff4c7c8754127cc097910cf9d80400adef5b65d" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">reveals</a> that the 4CHAN price is up 306% since last Thursday – yet was initially up over 460% before the price pulled back.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture1-13.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-255970" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture1-13.jpg" alt="Picture1" width="602" height="269" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture1-13.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture1-13-300x134.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture1-13-50x22.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0xe0a458bf4acf353cb45e211281a334bb1d837885#tokenAnalytics" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">According</a> to Etherscan.io, Saturday saw a massive spike in 4CHAN transfers, with 1,625 unique buyers and sellers involved.</p>
<p>In addition, several large buy orders have been placed in the past 24 hours totaling over $10,000, highlighting the renewed confidence and interest in this once-quiet token.</p>
<p>The community seems to be betting on a potential resurgence of 4CHAN, anticipating another huge rally – much like its initial launch.</p>
<p>Yet, while these metrics are undoubtedly positive for 4CHAN, fortunes can change in an instant.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture2-15.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-255969" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture2-15.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="297" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture2-15.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture2-15-300x148.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture2-15-50x25.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Looking at the price chart, 4CHAN has created a strong resistance zone just above where price currently sits. This zone has been rejected twice in the past two days, showcasing the volume of sell orders in the area.</p>
<p>Moreover, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/4-chan-token/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">data</a> from CoinMarketCap reveals that the 4CHAN trading volume is down 17% since yesterday – hinting that investor interest may already be waning.</p>
<p>Ultimately, while 4CHAN has clearly seen a resurgence, its future is still uncertain &#8211; meaning investors should proceed with caution and be watchful for any changes in sentiment.</p>
<h2>New Token Wall Street Memes Captivates Investors &amp; Raises $8.4m</h2>
<p>While 4-CHAN continues to capture investor attention, many are turning to <a href="https://bs_54c27399.cryptopotato.care" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Memes (WSM)</a> instead, believing it could be the next community token to experience a price pump.</p>
<p>Wall Street Memes is in the middle of a successful presale phase, which has seen the project raise over $8.4 million in less than one month.</p>
<p>During this presale, the project&#8217;s native token, WSM, can be purchased at a discounted price relative to the eventual CEX listing price.</p>
<p>Naturally, this attractive setup has prompted massive interest in Wall Street Memes, further enhanced by the project&#8217;s already-established community of over 1.1 million &#8220;degens.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture3-13.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-255968" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture3-13.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="285" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture3-13.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture3-13-300x142.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture3-13-50x24.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>This robust community aims to empower the everyday person and challenge the big hitters on Wall Street – much like the WallStreetBets subreddit did back in 2021.</p>
<p>However, the project also appeals due to the development team’s proven track record of delivering viral digital assets.</p>
<p>The team previously achieved success with the <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/wall-street-bulls" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall St Bulls NFT collection</a>, which sold out in 32 minutes and generated $2.5 million in sales back in 2021.</p>
<p>Now, with prominent social media influencers like Crypto Royal already <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3TNrAzQbLc&amp;pp=ygUYd2FsbCBzdHJlZXQgbWVtZXMgY3J5cHRv" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">endorsing</a> the project, the momentum behind Wall Street Memes is growing rapidly – marking it as a token to watch in the ever-evolving meme coin niche.</p>

<p><em>Broadening its horizons and looking to increase its on-chain footprint, ChainGPT has begun its interchain movement by bridging the $CGPT token to the Ethereum Network.</em></p>
<p>Enabled through a partnership with ChainPort, KuCoin, BitGet, and other top-tier Web3 partners, ChainGPT has developed a decentralized bi-directional bridge between the Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum for the $CGPT token. Now users will be able to transfer their $CGPT to and from the ETH and BNB/BSC networks seamlessly.</p>
<p>With the implementation of the bridge, the $CGPT token’s on-chain presence expands, gaining access to the robust and vibrant ecology of the Ethereum network. Integrations into many of the world&#8217;s leading DEFI protocols, the opening of token pools on DEXs, and the provision of added trading pairs against a broader segment of popular tokens becomes possible.</p>
<h2>What is $CGPT?</h2>
<p>At its core, $CGPT is enabling a decentralized economy for AI services. As the native token of the ChainGPT ecosystem, $CGPT serves the dual functions of a utility and governance tool. Its utility purpose is to provide access to a full suite of AI-powered Web3 tooling from NFT minting and community management to smart contract auditing and creation to launchpad tiering and beyond. Its governance function relates to the role of $CGPT in distributing ownership rights over the platform throughout its community members and giving them the opportunity to help steer the direction of the project’s development. <a href="https://dao.chaingpt.org/#/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">View the ChainGPT DAO here</a>.</p>
<h2>Where Will the ERC-20 Version of $CGPT be Supported?</h2>
<p>ChainGPT has been in communication with a multitude of exchanges that would be able to provide support immediately after instantiation. At this time, Kucoin, BitGet, and ByBit have confirmed support with a few select other major exchanges signaling their willingness.</p>
<p>On the front of decentralized venues for support, the most popular DEX in the world, UniSwap, will have a $CGPT token pool opened to provide instant listing and liquidity on Ethereum.</p>
<p>With the help of ChainPort, $CGPT’s presence on major crypto directories and analytics portals including CoinGecko and Etherscan has been expedited.</p>

<p>SINGAPORE — 6 June 2023 — <a href="https://www.asia.token2049.com/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">TOKEN2049</a>, Asia’s premier Web3 and crypto conference, has announced its first batch of high-profile title sponsors and headline speakers for its much-anticipated Singapore return. TOKEN2049 will take place from 13-14 September 2023 at <a href="https://www.marinabaysands.com/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Marina Bay Sands</a>, ahead of the <a href="https://www.formula1.com/en/racing/2023/Singapore.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Formula 1 Singapore Grand Prix 2023</a> race weekend.</p>
<p>TOKEN2049 is set to welcome over 10,000 attendees from over 3,500 companies, making it the largest event of its kind this year. With the conference taking place in Singapore once more, this speaks to the enduring importance of Asia as a driver of growth and vibrancy of innovation in the global digital asset ecosystem. Following the resounding success of its record-breaking Singapore 2022 event, TOKEN2049 will feature an expansive program of over 300 side events and networking opportunities taking place from 11-17 September throughout the city-state.</p>
<blockquote><p>Celebrating the event’s triumphant return to Singapore, Alex Fiskum, Co-Founder of TOKEN2049 said: “We’ve seen unprecedented traction and interest amid a record number of ticket registrations to date and confirmed speakers, sponsors and partners in our line-up. We expect TOKEN2049 Singapore to be the largest crypto event of the year, an unforgettable experience that will surpass our previous editions in terms of size, activity, and overall excitement.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Gathering global industry leaders, top decision-makers, and innovators, new additions to the 2023 agenda include hacker houses, technical workshops, and NFT galleries, among others. The 2023 edition of the conference has already surpassed last year’s attendance, sponsorship, and speaker milestones, with numbers rapidly rising ahead of September.</p>
<p>This year’s agenda spans the ever-evolving regulatory landscape, the rise of AI, Web3 gaming, NFTs and the metaverse, DeFi, scalability, interoperability, and many more. The impressive speaker line-up includes Balaji Srinivasan, Founder, Investor, and Author of The Network State; Joe Lubin, Co-Founder of Ethereum and Founder of ConsenSys; Stani Kulechov, Founder and CEO of Aave; Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital; Sandeep Nailwal, Co-Founder of Polygon; and Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, along with a range of leading industry figures.</p>
<blockquote><p>“This is the second year for us to combine TOKEN2049 and Singapore Grand Prix where we’ll unveil the new McLaren OKX custom livery. The event is a great starter to the weekend and to bring crypto and F1 fans together in a big way. This year has been about helping people see the future of Web3 through our latest “rewrite the system” campaign and Singapore will be a prime venue for us to amplify our efforts,” said Haider Rafique, Chief Marketing Officer at OKX.</p></blockquote>
<p>The diversity of this year’s title sponsors for TOKEN2049 Singapore speaks to the inherent vigour of the industry. This includes leading cryptocurrency spot and derivatives exchange OKX; global financial technology firm Circle Internet Financial (Circle); world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance; global digital asset market maker and multi-stage Web3 investment firm DWF Labs; open-source blockchain technology firm EOS Network Foundation; DeFi asset management protocol Tranchess; top cryptocurrency exchange platform Kucoin; the world’s largest multichain ecosystem Polkadot; all-in-one, institutionally-focused digital asset platform Fireblocks; leading decentralized blockchain operating system TRON DAO; world’s largest crypto copy trading platform Bitget; open-source, public blockchain Klaytn; and the world’s first Sharia-compliant crypto asset Islamic Coin.</p>
