<li dir="ltr">Gemini announced it was exploring the resisting, with the exchange announcing possibe re-enabling for spot and derivatives.</li>
<li dir="ltr">XRP was today ruled not to be a security as the SEC alleged in its lawsuit against Ripple.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Crypto exchanges <a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/coinbase/">Coinbase</a> and Kraken have re-enabled XRP trading for their US customers. Coinbase was first to announce the re-listing of the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/ripple/">Ripple</a> token, with Kraken swiftly joining it as XRP prices skyrocketed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gemini also announced it was exploring re-listing of XRP for both spot and derivatives trading.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Given today's ruling that the sale of XRP on exchanges is not a security, <a href="https://twitter.com/Gemini?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Gemini</a> is exploring the listing of XRP for both spot and derivatives trading.</p>
<p>&mdash; Gemini (@Gemini) <a href="https://twitter.com/Gemini/status/1679550388272283649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 13, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p dir="ltr">But Coinbase said in its announcement that XRP trading could still be restricted in some jurisdictions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Trading is anticipated to begin later today, if liquidity conditions are met. Once sufficient supply of this asset is established trading on our XRP-USD, XRP-USDT and XRP-EUR trading pairs will launch in phases. Support for XRP may be restricted in some supported jurisdictions.</p>
<p>&mdash; Coinbase Assets &#128737;&#65039; (@CoinbaseAssets) <a href="https://twitter.com/CoinbaseAssets/status/1679575241415172096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 13, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p dir="ltr">XRP&rsquo;s price gains and the crypto exchanges&rsquo; actions came after a US court had earlier on Thursday ruled that XRP was not a security.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">XRP court decision &ldquo;first step&rdquo; toward regulatory clarity</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Commenting on the decision to re-enable XRP trading, Marco Santori, Kraken&rsquo;s Chief Legal Officer,<a href="https://twitter.com/msantoriESQ/status/1679590081072594952" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;<u>said</u></a>:</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>T</em><em>his morning, the Federal Court for the Southern District of New York ruled that XRP is not a security. As such, just a few minutes ago, Kraken re-enabled trading in XRP for US users</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Santoru added that the exchange is looking at the court&rsquo;s decision on XRP as one more step towards regulatory clarity in the United States. But while crypto markets reacted bullishly to the news, Santori notes that there could still be some &ldquo;twists and turns&rdquo; with regard to the case.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>We view the court&rsquo;s decision as a first step toward meaningful legal clarity in the US. &nbsp;Clarity allows us to plan, to hire and to invest in here, where we were founded. The case is still likely to take some twists and turns, and other cases will follow similarly winding paths. Capitol Hill is working hard, too. Multiple bills are making their ways through congress. This is going to take years</em>,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As highlighted here, news of the judge&rsquo;s decision against SEC triggered massive buying pressure for XRP. The token&rsquo;s rally also sparked upward momentum for Stellar (XLM) and several other altcoins.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Shiba Memu is a new meme cryptocurrency that taps into the power of AI and blockchain.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Through AI, Shiba Memu will be a self-sustaining marketing powerhouse, delivering value to investors.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The price of the meme token increases every day, and its presale concludes in 8 weeks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Who thought meme cryptocurrencies would have so much following and attraction in this day and era? Just in early 2020, the market cap of the total meme token market was $0. In early 2022, the market was valued at over $20 billion, showing how much potential meme tokens have. Early entrants like Doge and Shiba Inu and latecomers like Pepe Coin have always elicited enthusiasm. But now, we are talking of a new meme coin that combines AI and blockchain technology, Shiba Memu(SHMU). Since launching its&nbsp;<a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>presale</u></a>, Shiba Memu has hit unprecedented demand, with more than 26,755,000 tokens sold.</p>
<p></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>What is Shiba Memu (SHMU)?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Memu is not your usual meme cryptocurrency. It is a revolutionary coin that taps into the power of AI and blockchain to create a self-sustaining marketing powerhouse.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As you already know, AI has been a buzzword since ChatGPT came into being in November 2022. Who doesn&rsquo;t know what ChatGPT can do today, including letting you do serious stuff like writing code or drafting an assignment?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Memu is a meme cryptocurrency that embodies the unique attributes of AI to learn and promote itself across social networks and other forums. With the help of AI-based software, Shiba Memu can write its own PR and promote successful marketing strategies.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Memu is also learning 24/7, all on its own, to become a better version of itself. As the power of AI grows, Shiba Memu will become more intelligent and powerful, achieving more than what hundreds or thousands of marketing agencies combined can do.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Does investing in Shiba Memu make sense?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Up to now, meme tokens have shown great potential, eliciting reactions even more than mainstream cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The potential reason is that investors are looking for fun and creative ways to engage in crypto, which is only possible through meme tokens.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">But investing in Shiba Memu is more than that. It carries a value proposition owing to its AI capabilities. It doesn&rsquo;t need those annoying Twitter or Reddit spats to gain traction. The token will pick battles on its own and generate hype using AI. This is its essence of being a meme token and remaining independent. That means the token can potentially explode in value and generate significant returns to investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Aside from that, who wants to miss out on the AI train? Tech wars are moving to AI, just like the internet disrupted everything and made adoption the only survival tactic. Put simply, Shiba Memu&rsquo;s AI angle manifests a trend that is catching up with us. The inevitable shift into AI makes Shiba Memu a worthwhile investment in the future.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Shiba price increases every day</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Memu is always on the move, right from the presale. The price of the token rises each day at 6 pm GMT, which is quite positive for its incremental value addition. Throughout the presale, the price will have doubled from a starting value of $0.011125 to $0.0244.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Memu&rsquo;s presale will last for 8-weeks and conclude with whatever amount investors will have put in. Token distribution will start when the presale ends. Since the project runs on ERC20 and BSC networks, investors can buy it with Ethereum, USDT, BNB, and BUSD.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Should you invest in Shiba Memu now?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Time is of the essence in investment, and finding projects that can deliver exceptional returns feels like a gift. History has taught that meme cryptocurrencies are most ideal when the hype is building up rather than when FOMO has dried up.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">If meme crypto is your preferred investment, this could be the right time to pick Shiba Memu before the presale ends. The potential for the token is huge, and the application area through AI is limitless.</p>

<li dir="ltr">XLM&rsquo;s stellar performance followed a staggering 87% jump in less than 3 hours for XRP.</li>
<li dir="ltr">XRP is Ripple&rsquo;s token, and a judge just declared it was not a security.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Stellar (XLM) price jumped nearly 70% on Thursday as bulls pushed past long term resistance levels to trade at prices last seen in April 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The catalyst was today&rsquo;s <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/ripple/"><u>Ripple news</u></a>.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Stellar price jumps as XRP rockets</h2>
<p dir="ltr">XLM price raced to highs near $0.20 to see it mirror broader crypto market upward action following one of the biggest news events in crypto history.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is after <a href="https://coinjournal.net/ripple/">Ripple</a>, the company behind the XRP coin won against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As CoinJournal <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/ripple-wins-sec-case-xrp-not-a-security/">reported</a>, the court battle has been around a case where the regulator sued the blockchain company over allegations that XRP was a security.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But on Thursday, Analisa Torres, Judge of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, handed Ripple the victory in a summary judgement. The judge&rsquo;s decision effectively declared XRP not a security.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The market&rsquo;s reaction to the news was swift, with buyers sending XRP to near $0.95 &ndash; its highest level since December 2021.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Elsewhere, Stellar&rsquo;s XLM was the top performer among altcoins as its price raced to near $0.20. Other top gainers were Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), and Solana (SOL). Bitcoin also traded to a new YTD price as did Ether that hit above $2k.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For the altcoins, the Ripple-fueled sentiment helped decelerate part of the downward pressure that had permeated the market after the SEC declared the tokens securities in lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">XLM price outlook</h2>
<p dir="ltr">XLM is looking to break higher as XRP eyes $1. The two cryptocurrencies, which have a lot in common in terms of their historical overview and market performance, are seeing the most gains today.</p>
<div class="fr-img-space-wrap"><span class="fr-img-caption fr-fic fr-dib fr-draggable" style="width: 700px"><span class="fr-img-wrap">
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/06/13/1689282483066-9f06c8d1-8bf8-44b2-95ac-afe14c3465bb.png" style="width: 700px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="700" height="287"><span class="fr-inner">Stellar XLM price on the weekly chart. Source: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/Nj348w4l/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TradingView</a></span></p>
<p></p></span></span>
<p class="fr-img-space-wrap2">With XRP likely to see a fresh burst in the next few days, upside momentum could cascade into XLM price. On-chain data shows XRP&rsquo;s massive price jump after the court&rsquo;s decision drove a lot of whale activity. This even as the market<a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1679582926110064640">&nbsp;<u>witnessed</u></a> a spike in volume.</p>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">If XRP price rallies higher above $1, it likely Stellar&rsquo;s native token will target $0.24 and above that, $0.40. On the downside, the main support remains at $0.073</p>

<li>Judge Analisa Torres rules XRP token is a not a security.</li>
<li>Coinbase will resume trading in XRP in the next few minutes.</li>
<li>XRP nearly doubled in value following the ruling today.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/search/xrp">XRP</a>&rdquo; &ndash; the native token of Ripple Labs nearly doubled in value on Thursday after the crypto company secured a &ldquo;huge win&rdquo; against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<h2>U.S. judge rules XRP is not a security</h2>
<p>Judge Analisa Torres of a U.S. District Court concluded the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/sec-vs-ripple-6743752" target="_blank" rel="noopener">case</a> today that has been dragged for three years now with a ruling that XRP is &ldquo;not&rdquo; a security.</p>
<blockquote><p>Defendants&rsquo; motion for summary judgement is GRANTED as to the Programmatic Sales, the Other Distributions, and Larsen&rsquo;s and Garlinghouse&rsquo;s sales, and DENIED as to Institutional Sales.</p></blockquote>
<p>The decision is a victory not just for Ripple but the crypto market at large that surpassed $1.20 trillion just hours after the ruling.</p>
<p><a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> was seen trading above $31,500 and <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> topped the $2,000 level.</p>
<h2>Coinbase to resume trading in XRP</h2>
<p>Reacting to the ruling, <a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/coinbase/">Coinbase</a> &ndash; the largest U.S. crypto exchange also confirmed on <a href="https://twitter.com/CoinbaseAssets/status/1679575239657758721?t=oUjJsgPbgEWuAQMYOaGPng&amp;s=08" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a> that trading will resume in XRP later today.</p>
<p>Note that the win Ripple has secured against the SEC on Thursday bodes well for other crypto companies as well that are currently facing intense regulatory scrutiny. That includes Coinbase itself.</p>
<p>Also this morning, the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1d1de06a-a904-4db3-9017-4c061bd6854d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Financial Times</a> confirmed that Jacobi Asset Management is all set to debut the Europe&rsquo;s first Spot Bitcoin ETF on the Euronext Amsterdam before the end of 2023. That also helped buoy the cryptocurrencies today.</p>
<p>In the U.S., heavy weights including <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-crypto-digitalising-gold/">BlackRock</a> are awaiting approval for a similar exchange-traded fund.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Verena Ross, Chair of ESMA, <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-seeks-first-input-detailed-rules-crypto-markets" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stated</a>:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;This first consultation package is an important milestone for ESMA in the implementation of the MiCA framework. It translates our ambition to set high regulatory standards in the EU for crypto-asset related activities into concrete requirements. We are determined to ensure entities involved in crypto-asset related activities understand that the EU is not a place for forum-shopping. &nbsp;We also want to remind consumers that, even with the implementation of MiCA, there will be no such thing as a safe crypto-asset.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">&#128995; ESMA published &#129351; consultation package under the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MiCA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MiCA</a>: <a href="https://t.co/MD2tdKi8v9">https://t.co/MD2tdKi8v9</a></p>
<p>&#128232; input on rules for crypto-asset service providers on &#128073; authorisation, identification and management of conflicts of interests &#128073; complaints</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Draft proposals include rules on conflict of interest</h2>
<p dir="ltr">According to ESMA, MiCA regulation requires that the regulator develops both regulating technical standards (RTS) and implementing technical standards (ITS).</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is the first consultation paper the regulator has released for MiCA and details seven proposals &ndash; five are draft RTSs while two are ITS.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Specifically, the RTSs requirements include notification by financial providers if they plan to offer crypto-asset services; regulatory approval for digital assets service providers; and crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) handling of customer complaints. The draft also covers disclosures of conflict of interest.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On requirements for segregation of client funds and assets, the regulator points to Article 62(2)(k) of MiCA. According to it, CASP applicants are obliged to ensure this is the case, with a description of how this is done.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>Some of the recent collapses in the crypto world have shown a misuse of clients&rsquo; funds and crypto-assets. This seems to have been permitted by a lack of governance and internal controls,</em>&rdquo; ESMA noted in the paper.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The ESMA proposals are a collaboration between the regulator and the European Banking Authority (EBA), which also released its first standards package on Wednesday, July 12.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Key takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin has maintained its value above $30k as more investors hold their cryptocurrency assets.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">AltSignals&rsquo; stage-2 presale has now surpassed 50%, with more than $1.1 million raised so far.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency market has been stagnant for the last two weeks, with the prices of most coins and tokens trading within specific ranges.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin, the world&rsquo;s leading cryptocurrency by market cap, has maintained its value around the $30k region over the past few weeks.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Inflation figures come out lower than expected</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Rising inflation figures in the United States and other parts of the world have led to the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates in recent months.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, the Fed didn&rsquo;t increase interest rates last month, and investors are now optimistic that the US apex bank might decrease interest rates later this month.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The SU Consumer Price Index for June was 0.2%, lower than what market analysts had expected. With inflation declining in the US, the Fed might reduce its interest rates in the near term.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If that happens, the cryptocurrency market could experience a positive performance. At press time, the&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>price of Bitcoin</u></a> stands at $30,566, up by less than 1% in the last 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/partner/ch80v5ehcieh00v1ak8g" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Data</u></a> obtained from Glassnode revealed that the number of wallets holding at least one BTC had reached an all-time high of 1,008,737 million.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As more people are holding Bitcoin, investment in other cryptocurrencies could increase in the near term. Investors could be looking to enter new projects and make excellent returns.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One of the projects investors could consider is AltSignals.&nbsp;<a href="https://token.altsignals.io/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=invezz&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>AltSignals</u></a> is still in its presale stage and has already raised more than $1 million in its second presale round.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What is AltSignals?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Before investing in AltSignals, it is advisable to know what the project is and the problem the developers intend to solve in the market.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://token.altsignals.io/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=invezz&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news"><u>AltSignals</u></a> is a project that primarily targets traders. It is a trading platform that provides trading signals for stocks, forex, indices, cryptocurrencies, and CFDs.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Although AltSignals is still in its presale stage, the team has raised more than $1 million and will use the funds to develop its platform.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The stage-2 presale has raised more than $1 million so far, with the team targeting around $2 million in this round.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">ASI, the native token of the AltSignals ecosystem, is currently sold for 0.01875 USDT. The token price could increase in the near term once the project officially launches and gets listed on cryptocurrency exchanges.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In their whitepaper, the AltSignals team revealed that they would use the funds to develop ActualizeAI, a solution that could make it easier for more people to enter the cryptocurrency trading scene.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">ActualizeAI will be AltSignals&rsquo; fully automated solution that would make it easier for people to trade cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://token.altsignals.io/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=invezz&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Visit the official AltSignals website</u></a> to learn more about their presale.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Should you invest in AltSignals now?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market have performed well since the start of the year. Year-to-date, Bitcoin is up by nearly 50%, outperforming the other major financial markets.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Market analysts predict that Bitcoin&rsquo;s price could surge higher in the medium to long term. If that happens, other cryptocurrencies could record massive gains too.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One of the projects to look out for is AltSignals. Although it is still in its presale stage, AltSignals could be a project that changes the way traders approach the market.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">If the development team delivers on its promise of a platform dedicated to traders,&nbsp;<a href="https://token.altsignals.io/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=invezz&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>AltSignals</u></a> could see an influx of traders on its platform, and that would result in ASI&rsquo;s price soaring higher over the next few months and years.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The launch of ActualizeAI could be a huge boost for AltSignals as the project seeks to attract more traders to the cryptocurrency ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul class="decimal_type">
<li>The FTC said Celsius &ldquo;squandered billions in user deposits&rdquo; after &ldquo;duping&rdquo; customers into depositing funds.</li>
<li>Celsius and its former CEO have also been sued by the US SEC today.</li>
<li>Last week, the CFTC found the former CEO and Celsius Network guilty of violating several laws while operating in the country.</li>
</ul>
<p>In what appears as a double tragedy for the bankrupt crypto lending platform Celsius Network, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has issued the company with a $4.7 billion fine.</p>
<p>The judgment will, however, be suspended to &ldquo;permit Celsius to return its remaining assets to consumers in bankruptcy proceedings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to the July 13 <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/07/ftc-reaches-settlement-crypto-platform-celsius-network-charges-former-executives-duping-consumers">FTC judgment</a>, Celsius and its affiliate firms will be permanently barred from &ldquo;offering, marketing, or promoting any product or service that could be used to deposit, exchange, invest, or withdraw any assets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FTC&rsquo;s fine was announced just hours after the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/cel-price-takes-another-hit-us-sec-files-lawsuit-against-celsius/">United States SEC filed a lawsuit</a> against Celsius Network and its former CEO Alex Mashinsky.</p>
<h2>Why is Celsius under siege by US regulators?</h2>
<p>The crypto lending company, which had its headquarters in New Jersey, offered customers a range of cryptocurrency services including interest-bearing accounts, personal loans backed by customers&rsquo; bitcoin deposits, and a cryptocurrency exchange before its collapse.</p>
<p>The FTC has stated that the platform co-founders Alex Mashinsky, Shlomi Leon, and Hanoch Goldstein misappropriated more than $4 billion in consumer assets while marketing the platform as a &ldquo;safe place&rdquo; for users to deposit their cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>The FTC also charged Celsius with making $1.2 billion in unsecured loans, lying about having a user insurance policy worth $750 million, and without having any way to track its assets and liabilities until late 2021. According to the FTC, officials reportedly lied about the state of the company even as the 2022 cryptocurrency bear market was beginning.</p>

<li>Celsius is currently going through a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding.</li>
<li>Last week, the US CFTC found Celsius and Alex Mashinsky guilty of breaking several laws before Celsius collapsed in 2022.</li>
<li>Alex Mashinsky has been arrested and will be arrayed in court on Friday.</li>
</ul>
<p>Celsius Network, a cryptocurrency lending company that collapsed in 2022, is the target of enforcement action by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<p>According to a Bloomberg report, the SEC has sued Celsius Network and its former CEO Alex Mashinsky. The report, however, stated that specifics of the complaint were not immediately available.</p>
<p>The lawsuit comes days after the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) determined that Celsius and Mashinsky had <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/cel-falls-after-celisus-network-and-its-former-ceo-found-guilty/">violated a number of American laws</a> prior to the company&rsquo;s collapse last year.</p>
<h2>Alex Mashinsky arrested in New York</h2>
<p>According to the report, Mashinsky was detained on Thursday morning as a result of an investigation into the company&rsquo;s collapse. Although the former CEO had denied any wrongdoing, he will be arraigned on Friday, July 14.</p>
<p>CFTC enforcement division lawyers determined that Mashinsky violated several US regulations while Celsius Network misled investors and neglected to register with the regulator.</p>
<p>The SEC and CFTC investigations started immediately when Celsius formally announced that the firm had <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/celsius-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-cel-price-on-the-decline/">begun voluntary Chapter 11 proceedings</a>.</p>
<p>The New York Attorney General Letitia James in January 2023 sued Mashinsky alleging that he made numerous &ldquo;false and misleading statements&rdquo; which led to investors losing billions.</p>
<p>According to the company, Celsius has $167 million in cash on hand. The money will enable Celsius to support &ldquo;certain operations during the restructuring process,&rdquo; the company claims.</p>
<h2>Celsius (CEL) price</h2>
<p>Just as was the case when the CFTC announced its findings, the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/celsius/">price of CEL</a>, Celsius Network&rsquo;s native token, has dropped sharply following the news of the SEC lawsuit.</p>
<p>At press time, CEL was trading at $0.1543, down 3.74% in the last 24 hours. The token however hit a daily low of $0.1486 after the news broke. And while it successfully recovered from the fall resulting from the CFTC conclusion, it is not clear if it will fully recover from today&rsquo;s fall.</p>
