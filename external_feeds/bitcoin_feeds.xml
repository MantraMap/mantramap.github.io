The securities regulator asserted that Binance platforms &#x201C;have made available for trading on them crypto assets that are offered and sold as investment contracts, and thus as securities.&#x201D;</strong></p>
<h2>SEC Highlights 12 Crypto Tokens as Securities in New Lawsuit</h2>
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has claimed that 12 crypto tokens are securities in its <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-faces-legal-action-by-sec-for-violating-us-securities-laws/">lawsuit</a> filed Monday against crypto exchange  and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ). The lawsuit also names Bam Trading Services, which operates crypto trading platform Binance.US, and its parent company Bam Management US Holdings as defendants. According to the lawsuit, Zhao owns 81% of Bam Management.</p>
<p>The SEC alleged that the defendants have &#x201C;unlawfully solicited U.S. investors to buy, sell, and trade crypto asset securities through unregistered trading platforms available online at Binance.com and Binance.US.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The regulator added that since the Binance platforms launched, the defendants &#x201C;have made available for trading on them crypto assets that are offered and sold as investment contracts, and thus as securities.&#x201D; The SEC&#x2019;s lawsuit <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp-pr2023-101.pdf">details</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This includes, but is not limited to, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a>, BUSD, and the units of each of the crypto asset securities further described below &#x2014; with trading symbols SOL, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a>, MATIC, FIL, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ATOM" target="_blank">ATOM</a>, SAND, MANA, ALGO, AXS, and COTI.</p></blockquote>
<p>Noting that Binance.com lists more than 350 crypto tokens, the lawsuit further states: &#x201C;The Binance platforms have made available for trading crypto assets that have been the subject of prior SEC enforcement actions based upon their status as crypto asset securities, including but not limited to AMP (the AMP token), REP (the Augur token), UST (the Terrausd token), and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/TRX" target="_blank">TRX</a> (the token associated with the Tron network).&#x201D;</p>
<p>The SEC has previously claimed that several other crypto tokens are securities, including <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/DASH" target="_blank">DASH</a>, TKN, NGC, and OMG, as stated in its lawsuit against <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-deems-dash-algo-and-omg-unregistered-securities-in-bittrex-lawsuit/">Bittrex</a>. In addition, the watchdog is still engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ripple-ceo-says-company-spends-200-million-fighting-sec-lawsuit-over-xrp-ruling-could-come-in-3-months/">Ripple Labs</a> over <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a>. Other regulators have also claimed that some crypto tokens are securities, including New York Attorney General <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/new-york-attorney-general-sues-crypto-exchange-coinex-claims-trading-platform-offers-unregistered-securities/">Letitia James</a> who stated in a lawsuit filed against crypto exchange  in February that AMP, LUNA, LBC, and RLY are securities.</p>

<p>The list of crypto securities expressly mentioned in the Binance lawsuit Monday does not include bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) or ether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>). SEC Chairman Gary Gensler previously said that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chairman-explains-why-he-views-all-crypto-tokens-other-than-bitcoin-as-securities/">all crypto tokens</a>, besides bitcoin, are securities. However, he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ethers-security-status-remains-unclear-as-sec-chair-gensler-fails-to-answer-lawmakers-question/">refused</a> to provide a definite answer when asked during his testimony before the House Financial Services Committee whether ether is a security or a commodity. Meanwhile, the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Rostin Behnam, has insisted that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cftc-chair-insists-ether-is-a-commodity-not-a-security-as-claimed-by-sec-chairman/">ether is a commodity.</a></p>
<p>Nonetheless, various individuals have pointed out that the opinion of the SEC or its chair is not the law. Lawyer Logan Bolinger has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chairman-explains-why-he-views-all-crypto-tokens-other-than-bitcoin-as-securities/">highlighted</a> that judges, not SEC chairs, have the ultimate authority in interpreting and applying the law.</p>

The team also promised to report &#8220;victim addresses to major exchanges &amp; blockchain analytics to trace and block the stolen funds.&#8221; </strong></p>
<h2>Atomic Wallet Team Says No Drained Transactions Reported in More Than 40 Hours</h2>
<p>Just under 48 hours after digital assets worth approximately $35 million were stolen from users of the Atomic Wallet, the team behind the decentralized wallet claimed in a tweet on June 4 that under &#8220;1% of monthly active users have been affected/reported.&#8221; The team added that the last confirmed drain of user assets had occurred more than 40 hours earlier.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/atomic-wallet-hack-decentralized-finance-wallet-breached-millions-lost-in-attack/">reported</a> by Bitcoin.com News, the statistics of the hack suggested that one individual had lost close to $8 million, while five individuals were thought to account for nearly half of the stolen funds. The Atomic Wallet team initially responded to the ensuing user complaints by promising to investigate and analyze the hacking incident.</p>
<p>However, more than 24 hours after confirming the hack, the Atomic Wallet team said investigations were still ongoing and that efforts were underway to block the stolen funds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Security investigation is ongoing. We report victim addresses to major exchanges &amp; blockchain analytics to trace and block the stolen funds,&#8221; the Atomic Wallet team said in the <a href="https://twitter.com/AtomicWallet/status/1665550651735023616">tweet</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h2>Users Asked to Be Wary of Twitter Accounts Promising Refunds</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, an onchain sleuth going by the name Zachxbt on Twitter has warned users of the wallet to be wary of phishing scammers using fake Atomic Wallet accounts. Unlike the blue checkmark Twitter handle which has been used by the Atomic Wallet to communicate with users, the parody account has a gold checkmark.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/26a0.png" alt="⚠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Careful phishing scammer with gold checkmark in the replies <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/26a0.png" alt="⚠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/kxWDGDXeK7">pic.twitter.com/kxWDGDXeK7</a></p>
<p>&mdash; ZachXBT (@zachxbt) <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1665551910579871745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 5, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>As shown in the screenshot of the scam account shared by Zachxbt on Twitter, the phishing scammers are attempting to lure victims of the hack by asking them to inquire if they are eligible for a refund. While the Atomic Wallet team responded to the warning by thanking Zachxbt, one report <a href="https://dailycoin.com/atomic-wallet-hack-fake-refunds-lure-more-victims/">suggested</a> that the scammers may have already stolen more funds via this tactic.</p>

<p>During Monday&#x2019;s trading sessions, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a>, currently the sixth-largest cryptocurrency asset in terms of global trade volume, witnessed approximately $1.52 billion in trading activity. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pancakeswap">pancakeswap (CAKE)</a>, experienced a substantial decline of 11.7% against the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>The impact of the SEC&#x2019;s announcement can also be seen in the amount of bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) that has been withdrawn from Binance. According to coinglass.com <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/Balance">statistics</a>, a significant sum of 9,802 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, valued at $249.36 million, has been moved out from Binance&#x2019;s bitcoin reserves.</p>
<p>While Binance witnessed an outflow of 9,802 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, Coinbase saw an inflow of 5,296 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> during the same period. As of now, Binance boasts a reserve of crypto assets, amounting to $54.35 billion, as reported by <a href="https://portfolio.nansen.ai/dashboard/binance">nansen.ai metrics</a>. Among these holdings, 17.49 billion <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT/">tether (USDT)</a> and 425,365 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, valued at $10.82 billion, are included.</p>

<p>Additionally, Binance holds a substantial amount of 3.8 million ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>), worth $6.8 billion based on the current exchange rates for ether. Moreover, Binance <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges">processed</a> $12.46 billion in crypto trade volume in the last 24 hours. This places Binance&#x2019;s current 24-hour trade volume at six times larger than that of most exchanges in the market today.</p>
<p>After Binance was sued by the U.S. securities regulator, the exchange <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/sec-complaint-aims-to-unilaterally-define-crypto-market-structure-8707489117122437402">responded</a> by noting it is &#x201C;disheartened&#x201D; by the SEC&#x2019;s choice to litigate rather than cooperate. &#x201C;We intend to defend our platform vigorously,&#x201D; Binance said on Monday. &#x201C;Unfortunately, the SEC&#x2019;s refusal to productively engage with us is just another example of the Commission&#x2019;s misguided and conscious refusal to provide much-needed clarity and guidance to the digital asset industry.&#x201D;</p>

<h2>Tether Backs Volcano Energy</h2>
<p><a href="https://tether.to/en/">Tether</a> is increasing its investments in recent times, having <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/tether-expands-stablecoin-issuer-announces-sustainable-bitcoin-mining-project-in-uruguay/">announced</a> a mining project in Uruguay and revealing an <a href="https://tether.to/en/tether-expands-its-presence-in-georgia-with-investment-in-citypayio/">investment</a> in the Georgia-based payment processing company Citypay.io. The stablecoin company, responsible for the largest stablecoin asset by market cap (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a>), <a href="https://tether.to/en/tether-participates-in-1-billion-investment-to-build-the-worlds-largest-bitcoin-mining-farm-in-el-salvador/">disclosed</a> on Monday that it participated in a $1 billion investment in Volcano Energy, which is backed by Max Keiser.</p>
<p>The funds obtained by <a href="https://twitter.com/Volcano_Energy">Volcano Energy</a> will be utilized for a 241-megawatt (MW) renewable energy mining facility in Metap&#xE1;n. The data center will harness <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435121001008">photovoltaic solar</a> and wind power to fuel the company&#x2019;s operations. Tether and Volcano Energy anticipate a substantial increase in the proportion of sustainable bitcoin mining in the forthcoming years.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Volcano Energy represents one of the most ground-breaking and strategic initiatives we are investing in and we look forward to working alongside Josue Lopez and his team to make El Salvador a global force in renewable energy production,&#x201D; Tether&#x2019;s CTO <a href="https://twitter.com/paoloardoino">Paolo Ardoino</a> said on Monday.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JosueLopezGal">Josue Lopez</a>, CEO of Volcano Energy, stated on Monday that 52% of the existing bitcoin mining operations utilize sustainable and renewable energy sources. &#x201C;We believe this percentage will significantly increase in the coming years, through important investments like ours,&#x201D; Lopez said. &#x201C;Not only is &#x2018;Volcano Energy&#x2019; important for the future of bitcoin resiliency, it&#x2019;s also an important sign of the new crucial role that El Salvador plays in the global tech environment.&#x201D;</p>

<h2 dir="ltr"><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> Defies Market Trends as Network Activity Rises; Supporters Optimistic of Lawsuit Outcome</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>&#x2019;s recent <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP/">market performance</a> is commendable, especially considering that many top crypto assets depreciated in value on June 5, 2023. Climbing 1.1%, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> (formerly known as Ripple) stands as the sole cryptocurrency in the top ten rankings to achieve gains over the last 24 hours and during the preceding week. Thus far, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> has accrued more than a 10% upturn against the greenback and a 15% growth within the past fortnight.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As of Monday, June 5, 2023, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> boasts a market cap of approximately $27.68 billion &#x2014; a figure constituting 2.355% of the $1.18 trillion total worth of all cryptocurrencies worldwide. At present, around 51.98 billion <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> are available on the market, with a recorded global trade volume of nearly $1.4 billion on Monday alone. Furthermore, data from market intelligence firm <a href="https://santiment.net">Santiment</a> reveals that May witnessed heightened activity throughout the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> network.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Santiment noted in its <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1663349921205088257">tweet</a> dated May 29: &#x201C;[<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> network] has now had its 2nd [and] 3rd largest address activity spikes of all time these past 2 days. A mild +4% decoupling has emerged between <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> [and] the [altcoin] pack, and if history repeats itself from the March 18th activity spike, it could be more.&#x201D; In addition to this uptick in activity, the daily processing capacity of transactions for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> sits roughly between <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/xrp-transactions.html#3y">1.2 and 1.66 million per day</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The rise in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>&#x2019;s value coincides with the ongoing legal tussle between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc5nbPb4-cw&ab_channel=3TWarriorAcademy">interview</a>, attorney <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1">John Deaton</a> postulated that Ripple Labs had a 25% likelihood of winning the case outright, whereas the odds of an outright SEC victory stood at less than 3%. In early May, Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple&#x2019;s CEO, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ripple-ceo-says-company-spends-200-million-fighting-sec-lawsuit-over-xrp-ruling-could-come-in-3-months/">disclosed</a> that the company had expended millions battling the regulatory body and anticipated a resolution shortly.</p>
<p dir="ltr"></p>
<p dir="ltr">One crypto trader named Captain Faibik, with a following of 61,000 on Twitter, posited that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> would skyrocket to the $1 range. He confidently <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoFaibik/status/1665547932823633920?s=20">tweeted</a> on June 4: &#x201C;<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> Train has already left the Station.&#x201D; However, some countered this claim by <a href="https://twitter.com/traderhodler/status/1665555512111534080?s=20">asserting</a> that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> was steadily &#x201C;going to zero.&#x201D; Despite such criticism, other traders <a href="https://twitter.com/pipsielot/status/1663188411874791424?s=20">similarly</a> endorsed Faibik&#x2019;s perspective. On June 3, one <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> supporter, boasting 45,000 followers, <a href="https://twitter.com/WillyWonkaXRP/status/1665049410647085057?s=20">inquired</a>: &#x201C;What will you do when <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> shreds $5 and continues to rise?&#x201D;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em><strong>What are your thoughts on <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>&#x2019;s resilience in the face of market trends and the ongoing lawsuit?

The multi-strategy firm was created to provide investors <em>of all sizes</em> with a top-tier Bitcoin mining solution that uses renewable energy sources, offering the added benefit of passive investing with a conscience.</p>
<p>Rollman Mining proudly offers access to 50-plus mining locations powered by renewable energy sources and continues to pursue the world&#8217;s finest miners, pools, hosting sites, and management solutions. With its personalised approach, it is committed to catering to its clients&#8217; needs every step of the way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before Rollman Mining, institutional grade Bitcoin mining had exclusively been available to institutional investors, rendering it near impossible for retail investors to enter or benefit from this truly revolutionary opportunity,&#8221; said Victor Rollman, CEO of Rollman Mining.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is widely acknowledged as a store of value for investors—both big and small &#8212; and is viewed as a stable investment with a wide range of potential future applications. As a result, it provides exposure to a highly disruptive asset class that can aid in achieving the appropriate level of diversification in an investor&#8217;s portfolio. During periods of political or monetary instability, bitcoin can even be viewed as a &#8220;flight to safety&#8221; vehicle. Mining it produces 100% to 300% additional profits than purchasing bitcoin outright, according to the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;Performance is created over the short and long term,&#8221; said Rollman. &#8220;It stems from strong convictions about investments capable of meeting the challenges of tomorrow. Our objective is to provide passive income through the best Bitcoin Mining investments, offering a superior return and hedge for any investor looking for the best.&#8221;</p>
<p>The firm offers what is called the &#8220;Bitman Antminer Series,&#8221; which is seen as the most efficient and high-performing, energy-efficient bitcoin mining opportunity. The firm offers a wide range of models, it boasts top-of-the-line features and specs to provide a uniquely competitive advantage.</p>
<p>The firm was founded by a team of financial services experts, traders, engineers, data scientists, operators, and risk managers that share a common interest in professionalising the Bitcoin mining industry. They do so by utilising 10-plus years of experience in the crypto space and 20-plus years in the global financial markets.</p>
<p>Rollman Mining&#8217;s products and services are specifically designed to empower clients with crypto-enabled passive income that is secure, stable, hassle-free, and managed by financial services professionals with the experience and know-how to inspire confidence.</p>

Gary Gensler, the chairman of the SEC, revealed that Binance is facing thirteen charges related to these violations.</strong></p>
<h2>Binance Hit With SEC Lawsuit Over Alleged Violations of U.S. Securities Laws</h2>
<p> faces another lawsuit as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) files a case in the District of Columbia. This comes after the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-sued-by-cftc-for-alleged-violations-of-trading-and-derivatives-rules/">sued</a> Binance in late March. A <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-101">press release</a> confirms the involvement of Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) as a defendant in the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp-pr2023-101.pdf">lawsuit</a>.</p>
<p>Binance faces multiple securities violations as charged by the regulator, alleging that the exchange clandestinely permitted &#x201C;high-value U.S. customers&#x201D; to utilize the international cryptocurrency trading platform. On Monday, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler disclosed that Binance stands accused of 13 distinct charges. Furthermore, the SEC alleges that Binance commingled customer assets.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Through thirteen charges, we allege that Zhao and Binance entities engaged in an extensive web of deception, conflicts of interest, lack of disclosure, and calculated evasion of the law,&#x201D; Gensler detailed. &#x201C;As alleged, Zhao and Binance misled investors about their risk controls and corrupted trading volumes while actively concealing who was operating the platform, the manipulative trading of its affiliated market maker, and even where and with whom investor funds and crypto assets were custodied.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Gensler added:</p>
<blockquote><p>The public should beware of investing any of their hard-earned assets with or on these unlawful platforms.</p></blockquote>
<p>Following the news, various cryptocurrency assets experienced a decline in value, with <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> registering a 2.5% decrease in the past 24 hours. Numerous other digital currencies faced even more substantial losses.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the SEC complaint asserts that Binance and CZ displayed a &#x201C;blatant disregard&#x201D; for U.S. securities laws, which encompasses operating an unregistered exchange, brokerage, and clearing house. It also involved enabling individuals to trade unregistered securities, including <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a> and BUSD.</p>
<p>After the complaint was released CZ <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1665742100845961217?s=20">responded</a>. &#x201C;Our team is all standing by, ensuring systems are stable, including withdrawals, and deposits,&#x201D; CZ said. &#x201C;We will issue a response once we see the complaint. Haven&#x2019;t seen it yet. Media gets the info before we do.&#x201D;</p>

The global market cap has fallen by 1.58% as of writing, due to today&#x2019;s red wave. Litecoin was a notable token to fall, dropping by nearly 5%.</strong></p>
<h2><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a></h2>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>, formerly ripple, remained near a multi-month high on Monday, despite today&#x2019;s bearish sentiment.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>/USD rose to a peak of $0.5447 to start the week, which is marginally lower than Sunday&#x2019;s high at $0.5466.</p>
<p>As a result of this, ripple remains close to its highest level since March 30, which saw markets peak at $0.5575.</p>

<p>Overall, the drop off from Sunday comes as traders opt to secure gains, which coincides with the relative strength index (RSI) dropping out of a support point.</p>
<p>Price strength fell below the floor at 69.00 earlier in the day, and is currently tracking at 67.75.</p>
<p>Should momentum continue in this direction, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> bears will likely target a floor at $0.5090.</p>

<h2>Litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>)</h2>
<p>On the other hand, litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>) was one of Monday&#x2019;s biggest losers, as prices fell by as much as 5%.</p>
<p>Following a high of $96.36 on Sunday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>/USD sank to an intraday bottom at the $91.79 level.</p>
<p>This drop sees litecoin fall for a second consecutive session, after a false breakout of a ceiling at $96.00</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, prices were relatively overbought, with the RSI hovering close to a ceiling at 62.00, prior to the decline.</p>
<p>Previous <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> bulls likely shifted their positions due to the proximity with the aforementioned resistance point.</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is now tracking at 52.00 after this sell-off, with a floor at 50.00 a potential landing zone.</p>

The active interest for the term has taken a nosedive since June 2022, when the search query for bitcoin reached a score of 64 out of 100.</strong></p>
<h2>Global Interest in Bitcoin Searches Drops by Over 73% in Less Than a Year</h2>
<p>Bitcoin interest has sunk to its lowest point since October 2022, as revealed by recent <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=bitcoin&hl=en">Google Trends data</a>. In the week spanning June 5 to 11, 2022, the search term &#x201C;bitcoin&#x201D; bottomed out at 25 out of 100. During the subsequent week, however, from June 12 to 18, 2022, the search term bitcoin rose to a score of 64. In just under a year, interest has dwindled by over 73%, plummeting to a 17 during the week of May 28 to June 3, 2023. Prior to the October 2022 low of 16, the last time bitcoin interest was at this level was October 2020.</p>
<p>Between October 25 and 31, 2020, the search term bitcoin garnered a score of 18, while the preceding week that month, it ranked at 16. Concurrently, Bitcoin&#x2019;s price began its ascent towards the all-time high achieved in November 2021, and interest in the search term mirrored this trend. From that juncture in October 2020, the term escalated to an 85 out of 100. Notably, during the week of May 16 to 22, 2021, the search term attained a perfect score of 100.</p>

<p>Since then, the crypto landscape has undergone a significant transformation, with bitcoin and the rest of the digital asset economy weathering a prolonged crypto winter. Nevertheless, while <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s price has improved since the close of 2022, interest remains lackluster. In December 2022, bitcoin was trading at $17,000 per unit, yet Google Trends data indicates that the score never dipped below 18 since then. Presently, the highest interest in the search query for bitcoin stems from <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-senators-reintroduce-accountability-for-cryptocurrency-in-el-salvador-aces-act/">El Salvador</a>, where the crypto asset is recognized as legal tender.</p>
<p>While El Salvador leads the pack in terms of interest in bitcoin in 2023, it is followed by <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/nigerian-central-bank-blasts-naira-devaluation-report-publication-stands-by-its-story/">Nigeria</a>, Switzerland, Netherlands, Austria, Slovenia, Germany, and Turkey. However, despite the global score of 17 for web searches, the <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&gprop=news&q=bitcoin&hl=en">search for bitcoin news</a> is even more dismal, registering a paltry 9 out of 100 during the week of May 28 to June 3, 2023. Interestingly the Netherlands is a hotbed of interest for news searches related to bitcoin. El Salvador ranks fifth on the list of countries with the most interest in bitcoin news searches.</p>

<p>Despite low general web searches and even lower searches for bitcoin news, Bitcoin has achieved significant milestones and experienced a flurry of activity in 2023. Recently, Bitcoin has confirmed a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-fees-decrease-but-over-257000-pending-transactions-await-confirmation/">record number</a> of daily transactions, but this has also led to a backlog and increased transaction fees.</p>
<p>In May, Bitcoin&#x2019;s hashrate reached an <a href="https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/bitcoin/hashrate-chart">all-time high</a>, almost hitting the 500 exahash per second (EH/s) mark. Additionally, millions of <a href="https://ordinals.com/">unique inscriptions</a> have been minted onchain, and Bitcoin has emerged as the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/nft-sales-climb-39-in-one-week-while-bitcoin-nft-sales-maintain-rapid-momentum/">second-largest network</a> for NFT sales, trailing only Ethereum. Compared to Bitcoin&#x2019;s 17, gold had a search volume score of 68 this past week, while Ethereum had a search volume score of 2.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) was trading below the $27,000 level on Monday, as crypto market volatility remained high to start the week.</p>
