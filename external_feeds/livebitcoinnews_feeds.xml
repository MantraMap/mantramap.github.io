										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The banking sector of Africa is worth $86 million at the time of writing, and bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are expected <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/bitcoin-is-poised-to-blow-up-africas-86-billion-banking-system/ar-AA195JiF" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">to disrupt the industry</a> like no other technologies can.</p>
<h2>Africa Could Be Completely Changed Thanks to Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Mike Brock – CEO of TBD at Block, a financial company run by Jack Dorsey – says one of the big ways that bitcoin can help Africa is that it can be used to ultimately move money around regardless of the present state of the economy. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>It doesn&#8217;t matter to me if the price goes down or up because I can still use bitcoin as a vehicle to move money around the world instantaneously. I can exchange dollars for bitcoin and then bitcoin for Brazilian rial. There is a market for bitcoin in every corner of the world today.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ray Youssef – the CEO of Paxful – seconded this idea, commenting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left">If someone wants to move money to the country next door, normally, you&#8217;d have to fill up a suitcase full of cash and move it over the border.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The banking industry of Africa has long been on its knees for several reasons, the inflation (or deflation) of national currencies being a big one. In addition, many governments in Africa are also riddled with corruption, thus causing several residents of the continent to be denied access to standard financial tools like bank accounts. With bitcoin, they don’t need to worry about this and can still gain access to all the tools and services they need to survive. Youssef mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>The entire banking system in Africa is completely and utterly broken, even amongst the mobile money providers, the telcos. Two thousand payment networks and only two percent of them talk to each other. That number continues to grow. It&#8217;s not getting better, it&#8217;s getting worse.</p></blockquote>
<p>While there are other products and enterprises out there – such as Western Union and MoneyGram – that offer money conversion services, many of them charge heavy fees or require that transacting parties to lose large chunks of their money. Alex Gladstein – chief strategy officer for the Human Rights Foundation – was quick to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re going to move to a model where we can make payments without IOUs, or credit, or promises, or fiat. It&#8217;s literally like sending a piece of gold or a $20 bill instantly somewhere else. If you can get access to the internet, you can settle bitcoin payments, and the government can&#8217;t do anything about it.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Dorsey&#8217;s Comments on Crypto</h2>
<p>While touring Accra – the capital city of Ghana in <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/africa/" data-wpel-link="internal">Africa</a> – Dorsey said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Nigerian government went to various bank corps to stop protesters from receiving money which bitcoin made up for, so our whole reason for being as a company is solving the same problem that bitcoin will ultimately solve for everyone in the world.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Benjamin Von Wong – a Canadian artist responsible for creating the “Skull of Satoshi” installation back in mid-March – has <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/skull-satoshi-artist-says-wrong-101225197.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">apologized for his work</a>, claiming in a recent interview that it was “never meant to be anti-bitcoin,” and he is not pleased people took it in such a way.</p>
<h2>Benjamin Wong: I Never Sought to Create an Anti-Bitcoin Project</h2>
<p>Wong stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>It was an optimistic hope that bitcoin could shift away from the needless burning of fossil fuels without losing all the other features that make bitcoin safe, secure, and decentralized… I’ve spent my entire career trying to reduce real-world physical waste, and PoW felt intuitively wasteful. Of course, I was wrong.</p></blockquote>
<p>Skull of Satoshi was unveiled after Wong and his fellow associates at Greenpeace worked on it for over a year. The goal was to try and shed light on the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/report-bitcoin-mining-may-require-more-energy-than-180-countries/" data-wpel-link="internal">wasteful energy</a> use in the bitcoin mining industry. The project has been supported by several cryptocurrency heads including Chris Larsen, the Ripple co-founder. The idea behind it is to “change the code, not the climate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sadly, there has been backlash thrown at the project from those who feel bitcoin is simply being pushed towards PoS territory like Ethereum. Rolf Skar, a special projects manager at Greenpeace USA, explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are pointing to the fact that other cryptocurrencies realized that PoW has an energy problem and changed. Bitcoin is the laggard in this area and is sticking to decade-old technology while other newer cryptocurrencies are using different consensus mechanisms and cutting their carbon emissions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wong has further stated he’s going to remove himself from future projects similar with Skull of Satoshi so he can really analyze himself and his work and see where it is, specifically, that he can contribute to stronger aspects of environmental responsibility. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>I needed to first string together some official responses to the Twitterverse and [I’d] been trying to digest all the different fragments of information I was receiving from various places. I&#8217;m trying to better understand the nuance between progress and perfection.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Pos Isn&#8217;t Possible for BTC</h2>
<p>Skar further commented he’s not necessarily against bitcoin, and he’s confident humans can be innovative enough that they manage to find new ways of ensuring the environment’s survival while remaining creative. He mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>The climate crisis demands that we all, not just Greenpeace or bitcoin, find ways to ensure a just and green future. We regularly work on issues that are objectively more complicated and difficult to figure out than changing bitcoin’s code. It is only impossible if we refuse to try.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some, such as Phil Harvey – CEO of bitcoin mining firm Sabre56 – says it’s virtually impossible for BTC to switch to a PoS network, and he’s confident that users would never accept it as an original network even if this was doable.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite a relatively broad history with cryptocurrencies and digital assets, graphics card manufacturer Nvidia has <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/98081-nvidia-calls-cryptocurrency-useless-society-gpus-better-used.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">come out to say that crypto</a> has no purpose in society.</p>
<h2>Nvidia Doesn&#8217;t Think Crypto Has Much to It</h2>
<p>In a recent interview, the company’s chief technology officer Micheal Kagan commented that the graphics cards Nvidia creates should be utilized for activities other than simply mining crypto. He suggested using them to power AI-based technologies like Chat GPT. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>All this crypto stuff, it needed parallel processing, and [Nvidia] is the best, so people just programmed it to use for this purpose. They bought a lot of stuff, and then eventually it collapsed because it doesn&#8217;t bring anything useful for society. AI does. With Chat GPT, everybody can now create his own machine, his own program. You just tell it what to do, and it will, and if it doesn&#8217;t work the way you want it to, you tell it, &#8216;I want something different.’</p></blockquote>
<p>Chat GPT is getting a lot of traction as of late given it’s an application that will pretty much write whatever you need it to, from a blog post to a speech, as in the case of a recent one produced for Joe Biden. Apparently the President’s brain is <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/how-chat-gpt-could-be-used-to-boost-blockchain/" data-wpel-link="internal">melting so badly he can’t</a> even take the time to write his own speech; he needs a machine to do it for him.</p>
<p>In any case, putting this present situation aside, Kagan is confident in the technology and he thinks the company’s graphics cards will be put to greater use should they be utilized to power said applications instead of extracting new units of crypto from the blockchain. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>We were heavily involved in algo trading. People on Wall Street were buying our stuff to save a few nanoseconds on the wire, the banks were doing crazy things like pulling the fibers under the Hudson taut to make them a little bit shorter, to save a few nanoseconds between their datacenter and the stock exchange. I never believed that [crypto] is something that will do something good for humanity. You know, people do crazy things, but they buy your stuff, you sell them stuff, but you don&#8217;t redirect the company to support whatever it is.</p></blockquote>
<h2>The Company Was Once Heavily Tied to Digital Currency</h2>
<p>The funny thing about this entire situation is the fact that Nvidia has been used heavily over the years specifically for mining purposes. So many of the firm’s products were sold to miners that the company wound up getting indirectly tied to digital assets about five years earlier, and when crypto prices crashed, so did its revenue and stock shares.</p>
<p>At the same time, Nvidia failed to disclose how much money it made from miners in 2022. This led to a $5.5 million fine from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the highly anticipated Consensus 2023 conference, hosted by CoinDesk, got underway on April 26th, CoinW made its presence known as a deep partner of the event. Attendees couldn&#8217;t help but notice CoinW&#8217;s brand elements prominently displayed throughout the conference, from the sign-in area&#8217;s background wall to the escalator and booth. This marks CoinW&#8217;s first major exhibition appearance in the United States within the Web3 field, representing a significant milestone in the company&#8217;s global strategic expansion.</p>
<div id="attachment_78166" style="width: 554px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-78166" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-78166 size-full" src="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2023/05/Picture4.jpg" alt="" width="554" height="554" /><p id="caption-attachment-78166" class="wp-caption-text">CoinW and Beosin, the world&#8217;s leading blockchain security company, have jointly sponsored the on-site sign-in wall.</p></div>
<p>Consensus, hosted by CoinDesk, the world&#8217;s leading blockchain and cryptocurrency media, is set to take place in Austin, Texas, USA from April 26 to 28, 2023. As one of the most significant global summits focused on Web3 and blockchain technology, the event is often compared to the Super Bowl and World Cup in the blockchain field, and the Cannes Film Festival in the Web3 space. With its impressive lineup of keynote speakers, panel discussions, and exhibitions, Consensus has become a must-attend event for anyone looking to stay up-to-date of the latest trends and developments in the rapidly evolving blockchain and Web3 ecosystems.</p>
<p>Each year, Consensus Conference attracts an impressive lineup of industry leaders, community KOLs, investors, Web3 project builders, artists, government officials, and media representatives who converge to discuss the future of Web3. This year marks the ninth edition of the event, which spans three days and features ten stages hosting workshops focused on cryptocurrencies, blockchain, Web3, metaverse, and artificial intelligence. Attendees can also look forward to a range of additional networking events, parties, live music performances, and experiential activities, both during and after the conference.</p>
<p>As a strategic partner of the Consensus conference, CoinW went all out to make its mark. Not only did it exclusively sponsor the background wall and escalators, but the company also secured a prime location for its booth to showcase its full ecological business layout and educate attendees about CoinW&#8217;s development and vision. Moreover, to express its gratitude to the audience, CoinW arranged a lottery with carefully curated prizes centered around the company&#8217;s brand. Additionally, CoinW invited attendees to shoot videos and send best wishes to CoinW users via its official Twitter handle (@CoinWOfficial). By leveraging the opportunity to connect with its audience, CoinW made the most of its presence at Consensus 2023 to raise brand awareness and foster enhanced interaction with the Web3 community.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-230567 aligncenter" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture3-420x420.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="420" /></p>
<p>As a leading comprehensive encrypted asset trading platform, CoinW is dedicated to product development while expanding its global strategic reach. The company has successfully established localized communities and volunteer organizations in countries such as Turkey, Vietnam, Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, Malaysia, India, Russia, and other regions. Through building these localized communities, CoinW offers compliant, regionalized, and diversified encrypted asset services to millions of users. With the United States ranking first in the Crypto regional development index in 2022 and holding the largest share of the DeFi market, it has become a top priority for CoinW&#8217;s global expansion efforts. The company&#8217;s strategic partnership with Consensus 2023, by CoinDesk, marks yet another significant milestone in CoinW&#8217;s global strategic plan.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, CoinW remains committed to expanding its market presence in North America, Africa, Europe, Southeast Asia, and beyond. Through targeted initiatives such as inviting local government agencies, well-known venture capitalists, mainstream media, industry partners, and cross-brand collaborators, CoinW is able to establish stronger relationships with local partners through offline salons, forums, receptions, and other events, thereby driving the growth of the CoinW ecosystem in the global marketplace.</p>

<li>ADA price is showing bearish signs below the $0.412 support zone against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>The price is now trading below $0.40 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.3980 on the 4-hour chart (data feed via Coinbase).</li>
<li>The price could continue to move down if it stays below the $0.412 resistance zone.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Cardano price is struggling below $0.412 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-faces-uphill-task-near-29250/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a>. ADA price could start a fresh increase if it clears the $0.398 and $0.412 resistance levels.</em></p>
<h2>Cardano Price Analysis</h2>
<p>In the past few days, Cardano price saw a fresh decline from the $0.415 zone against the US Dollar. The ADA/USD pair declined below the $0.405 and $0.400 support levels.</p>
<p>The price even declined below the $0.385 support and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/cardano-ada-price-analysis-bears-take-control-below-0-40/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. It revisited the $0.3800 support zone. A low is formed near $0.3803 and the price is consolidating losses. It is now trading below $0.40 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</p>
<p>Besides, there is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.3980 on the 4-hour chart. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $0.3880 zone or the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.4152 swing high to the $0.3803 low.</p>
<p>The first major resistance is near the $0.400 level or the trend line. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.4152 swing high to the $0.3803 low.</p>
<p>A clear upside break above the $0.400 level might send the price toward the $0.412 resistance. Any more gains could start a steady increase toward the $0.425 level. On the downside, immediate support is near the $0.380 level.</p>
<p>The next major support is near the $0.376 level, below which the price may perhaps decline toward the $0.350 support level. Any more losses might call for a test of the $0.320 level.</p>

<li>Ethereum price is gaining bearish momentum below the $1,900 resistance against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>ETH price is now trading below $1,920 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,910 on the 4-hour chart (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair could recover, but it is likely to face sellers near the $1,920 resistance zone.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Ethereum price is declining below $1,920 against the US Dollar. ETH/USD remains at a risk of more downsides below the $1,800 support zone.</em></p>
<h2>Ethereum Price Analysis</h2>
<p>This past week, Ethereum struggled to clear the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-eth-revisits-key-support-but-struggles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">$1,950 resistance zone</a> against the US Dollar. ETH price attempted a few times to clear the $1,950 level but failed.</p>
<p>The recent high was formed near $1,939 and the price started a fresh decline. There was a drop below the $1,900 and $1,880 support levels. The pair even spiked below the $1,820 support. A low is formed near $1,805 and the price is now consolidating losses.</p>
<p>It is now trading below $1,880 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-eth-holds-key-uptrend-support-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. The price is now facing resistance near the $1,870 level. It is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,939 swing high to the $1,805 low.</p>
<p>The next major resistance is near the $1,900 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,910 on the 4-hour chart. The trend line is near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,939 swing high to the $1,805 low.</p>
<p>The next major resistance is near the $1,940 zone. A clear move above the $1,910 and $1,940 resistance levels might call for a fresh move to $2,000. Any more gains could even send the price toward the $2,100 resistance zone or even $2,140 in the near term.</p>
<p>On the downside, initial support is near the $1,820 level. The next major support is now near the $1,800 level. A break below the $1,800 support could push the price to $1,720. If the bulls fail to protect the $1,720 support, the price might decline toward $1,650.</p>
<div id="attachment_78160" style="width: 1834px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2023/05/Ethereum.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-78160" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-78160" src="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2023/05/Ethereum.png" alt="Ethereum Price" width="1834" height="845" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-78160" class="wp-caption-text">Ethereum Price</p></div>
<p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSD/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="exclude">chart</a>, Ethereum price is trading below $1,880 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours). Overall, Ether’s price could recover, but it is likely to face sellers near the $1,920 resistance zone.</p>
<h2>Technical indicators</h2>
<p>4 hours MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is now gaining momentum in the bearish zone.</p>
<p>4 hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.</p>
<p>Key Support Levels – $1,820, followed by the $1,800 zone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do Kwon – the crypto executive behind the Terra USD collapse that occurred in the summer of 2022 – has <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/fugitive-cryptocurrency-king-behind-2022-s-40b-crash-arrested-fleeing-montenegro-with-fake-documents/ar-AA192Gzx" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">been arrested and taken</a> into custody.</p>
<h2>Do Kwon Has Reportedly Been Taken In</h2>
<p>Kwon has allegedly been a fugitive these past few months. He was apprehended in the European nation of Montenegro, where he was found to be holding phony passports and documentation. The country’s interior minister Filip Adzic issued the following statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Montenegrin police have detained a person suspected of being one of the world&#8217;s most wanted fugitives, South Korean citizen Do Kwon, co-founder and CEO of Singapore-based Terraform Labs. The former &#8216;cryptocurrency king&#8217;, who is behind losses of more than 40 billion dollars, was detained at the Podgorica airport with falsified documents, and South Korea, the USA, and Singapore are demanding [his extradition].</p></blockquote>
<p>The collapse of Terra USD and its alternate Luna token cost crypto investors billions in hard-earned investment funds. In late 2022, the region of South Korea <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/prosecutors-hunt-for-terra-luna-crypto-exec-do-kwon/" data-wpel-link="internal">issued an arrest warrant</a> for Kwon, citing him as the main person of interest behind the collapse given his status as CEO of Terraform Labs, the company responsible for the creation of both assets.</p>
<p>Kwon eventually went into hiding while claiming on Twitter that he was willing to cooperate with the authorities and that he was not running from the law. In fact, he <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/crypto-exec-do-kwon-says-hes-willing-to-cooperate-following-arrest-warrant/" data-wpel-link="internal">went so far as to say</a> he was simply coding in his living room.</p>
<p>His presence in Montenegro appears to put these statements in doubt. By February 1 of this year, Kwon had gone silent on social media and he hasn’t tweeted anything since. According to Montenegro authorities, Kwon had allegedly been trying to travel to Dubai using a phony Costa Rican passport. He was also in possession of what has been deemed a fake Belgian passport.</p>
<p>South Korean law enforcement agencies have already confirmed that the fingerprints of the arrested man match those of Kwon’s, suggesting they now have their man.</p>
<p>Terra USD had been classified as a stable coin, so it was shocking to many people not only when the asset lost its peg, but when it went under fully. However, what many traders likely didn’t understand was that it was merely an “algorithmic” stable coin, meaning it wasn’t tied to any serious collateral (i.e., gold or precious metals) or fiat currencies. Rather, its value only stayed consistent when people chose to believe in it.</p>
<h2>Was This All a Scam?</h2>
<p>It has been suggested that the $40 billion collapse of the asset may have <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-sec-case-against-crypto-exec-do-kwon-just-got-a-lot-hairier/" data-wpel-link="internal">been a rug pull</a> of sorts or a similar scam given that just weeks before the crash occurred, Kwon and various executives of the company moved millions of dollars in BTC out of the project.</p>
<p>Kwon’s lawyers have yet to comment on his arrest.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Binance – the world’s largest and most popular digital currency exchange per daily market data – gave traders a bit of a scare in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/binance-pauses-deposits-withdrawals-due-issue-affecting-spot-trading-2023-03-24/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">late March when it put</a> a temporary halt in place on spot trading, citing system glitches as the reason for doing so. The move only lasted a few hours and trading was quickly restored on the platform, but it had a few people shaking in their boots.</p>
<h2>Binance Briefly Stopped Trading Over a Month Ago</h2>
<p>The trading firm issued a statement claiming that there was a “bug on a trailing stop order.” CEO Changpeng Zhao commented in a tweet that temporarily stopping all deposits and withdrawals was standard procedure when such a thing occurred, and that traders could expect to resume activities soon. True to his word, the halt only lasted a few hours.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, there doesn’t appear to be anything further behind the stoppage. This was later confirmed by Ilya Volkov, the CEO of You Hodler. Ilya said that there was merely a technical glitch in play, and that crypto prices weren’t likely to be heavily affected following the pause, though bitcoin appeared to take the new badly and dropped into the high $27K range (about $500 less than where it had been just a day earlier). Volkov commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>These kinds of bugs could happen everywhere, and crypto exchanges are not unique.</p></blockquote>
<p>The main reason, however, why so many people took the stoppage personally or as bigger than it probably was is because this is not the first time Binance has taken such action. In fact, over the past few months, the large digital exchange has made a real name for itself when it comes to halting and stopping specific trades or currencies from being utilized.</p>
<p>For example, in mid-March, the company announced it would be halting all future sterling deposits and withdrawals, and that the currency would no longer be applicable to investment methods or trades through its platform. This followed USD transfers, which ended in February of this year.</p>
<p>Binance has also been subjected to ongoing investigations as of late for what are alleged to be money laundering practices. A top executive of the firm has told news outlets that the company plans to pay penalty fees in the coming future to relieve the charges and end any further investigations.</p>
<h2>The SEC Has Been Relentless</h2>
<p>It’s unclear if Binance really took part in wrongdoing at the time of writing, or if the investigations are just more efforts from agencies such as the SEC to bring down crypto in America and beyond.</p>
<p>The crypto regulatory crackdowns have become extreme in the past few weeks. Agencies such as the SEC have targeted firms <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/is-the-sec-trying-to-kill-crypto-for-good/" data-wpel-link="internal">such as Kraken</a>, and it recently sent a Wells notice to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-receives-wells-notice-from-the-sec/" data-wpel-link="internal">crypto exchange Coinbase</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just a day ago, we talked about how Coinbase was <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-receives-wells-notice-from-the-sec/" data-wpel-link="internal">served a Wells notice</a> by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The situation is scary given that Coinbase has met with the SEC over 30 times in recent years, and thus the exchange really doesn’t appear to be in a position of any wrongdoing. The situation just comes off as more evidence that Biden and his nation and innovation-hating cronies will do anything to ensure crypto dies in America and that residents cannot enjoy alternative means of finance.</p>
<h2>Biden and the SEC Are Working to Take Crypto Out for Good</h2>
<p>The SEC cannot engage in action without a distinct and clear path from Biden to do so. Everyone in politics today or in federal agencies say they want to regulate digital currency to ensure nothing like what happened with <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/" data-wpel-link="internal">FTX</a> ever occurs again. However, there really aren’t any serious attempts to integrate said regulation or valid laws that would pertain to the space. Rather, all agencies like the SEC are doing are persecuting whatever crypto firms don’t fit with their present narratives.</p>
<p>It’s easy to assume that because this is a new industry, members of the SEC and other financial organizations in the U.S. don’t know what to do when it comes to crypto. That this is what they’ve done before, and thus they’re trying to apply old methodologies to what can only be labeled new sectors and technologies. After all, agencies like the SEC have been seen taking this sort of action before.</p>
<p>Two years ago, for example, SEC head Gary Gensler permitted a <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/a-bitcoin-etf-has-made-it-to-the-u-s-but-is-it-what-traders-are-looking-for/" data-wpel-link="internal">company called Pro Shares</a> to unveil a new bitcoin ETF. This should have gotten everyone excited, but the problem was that the ETF was not based on spot trading. Instead, it was based on BTC futures, which many traders said were largely inferior to physical BTC units. The product also fell under a 1940s law that applied primarily to items like mutual funds.</p>
<p>How could such a law ever apply to crypto? The fact is that it cannot, yet the SEC hasn’t done anything to change the statute’s verbiage. When it comes to going after companies it doesn’t like, the SEC is very quick to move forward, yet it’s slower than a turtle when working to officially offer traders new opportunities for investment.</p>
<h2>Attacking Companies Left and Right</h2>
<p>Two months ago, it was announced that Biden was using an Obama-era policy <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/is-biden-using-an-obama-era-program-to-ban-btc/" data-wpel-link="internal">to shut crypto companies</a> out of the financial world altogether. They could not gain access to bank accounts or other tools that would allow them to stay in business (similar to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-43669730" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">what was seen in India</a> five years prior).</p>
<p>Now, the SEC is going after every crypto firm it can from Coinbase to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/is-the-sec-trying-to-kill-crypto-for-good/" data-wpel-link="internal">Kraken</a>, and it’s becoming clear the agency is simply a general in what can be called Biden’s anti-crypto army.</p>
