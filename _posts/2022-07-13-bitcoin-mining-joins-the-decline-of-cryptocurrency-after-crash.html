<p>The Bitcoin mining community struggles to regain composure following the <a href="https://blog.liquid.com/bitcoin-crash-2022"><span>recent crash</span></a>. Since May, 2022, Bitcoin has fallen to more than 40% its former glory and is now dwindling slowly from $19,000.</p> 
<p>The crash brought Ethereum and a host of other cryptocurrencies down with it. A swirl of panic violently emerged as sell-offs flooded the market. As expected, the crisis has now spilled over into mining since itâ€™s one of the primary methods of obtaining Bitcoin. It may not be the most preferable method, but is certainly the most risk-averse route in terms of financial investment.</p>
