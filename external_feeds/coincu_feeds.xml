<p>In operation from 2016 to 2018, <strong>BitConnect Shortly after the project&#8217;s closure</strong>, the value of the crypto coin it was linked to plummet.</p>



<p>Many states, including Texas, North Carolina, and the U.K., took steps early to limit Bitconnect&#8217;s operations. However, because of the project&#8217;s decentralized nature and lack of centralized leadership, several developments around it persisted even after it was formally shut down or came under regulatory scrutiny.</p>



<p>Additionally, due to the nature of the case, victims have had to wait years for recompense. The <strong>DOJ seized $56 million in bitcoin in November 2021,</strong> intending to resell it and compensate the victims. Although the DOJ had not said precisely when it sold the confiscated cryptocurrency for cash, the $56 million in cryptocurrency funds would now be worth about $17 million owing to market fluctuations.</p>



<p>In any case, because BitConnect&#8217;s assets were taken from Arcaro personally, just a portion of their value—$17 million—will be given back to victims. According to a DOJ statement from the beginning of 2022, BitConnect received $2.4 billion from investors.</p>

<p>In a letter dated Jan. 12 issued to New York District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan, lawyers for the media moguls claimed that &#8220;the public&#8217;s entitlement to know Bankman-guarantors Fried&#8217;s outweighed their privacy and safety rights.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Washington Post, Associated Press, Bloomberg, CNBC, Dow Jones, The Financial Times, Insider, and Dow Jones are among the media outlets attempting to urge the judge to reveal the names of Bankman-guarantors. Fried&#8217;s</p>



<p>In making their case, the media’s lawyers used case precedent from<strong> Ghislaine Maxwell’s Dec. 2020 case — where the bond guarantors&#8217; names weren’t revealed </strong>— to argue that Sam Bankman-Fried’s financial crimes were not as serious as Maxwell’s involvement in Jeffery Epstein’s child sex traffic ring scandal:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;While Mr. Bankman-Fried is accused of serious financial crimes, a public association with him does not carry nearly the same stigma as with the Jeffrey Epstein child sex trafficking scandal.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Reuters reported on January 12 that<strong> Bankman-attorneys Fried had previously argued that Bankman-sureties Fried should remain anonymous</strong> because Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, Bankman-parents Fried and co-signers of the $250 million bond, have been the target of persistent physical threats ever since FTX&#8217;s disastrous collapse in early November.</p>



<p>The guarantors&#8217; welfare and safety would be &#8220;serious cause for concern&#8221; if their names were made public, according to Bankman.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Large Bitcoin accumulations in recent weeks have had a significant impact on the coin&#8217;s comeback above $18,000.</em></li>



<li><em>Fear had subsided in the larger market, but a $20,000 prediction appeared to be a difficult aim in the immediate term.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>Bears may have been taken aback as Bitcoin BTC defied expectations and soared beyond $18,000 to continue its strong start to the year.</strong></h5>

<p>According to <strong>Glassnode&#8217;s statistics</strong>, the achievement would have been impossible without the string of significant accumulations since BTC traded around <strong>$16,500</strong>. According to the on-chain analytic tool, <strong>the acquisition continued until the price hit $18,200</strong>.</p>

<p>This has assisted in converting 13% of the coin&#8217;s circulating supply into profits. It is worth noting that the indicator represents the percentage of total supply kept in profit. According to supply in profit data,<strong> the 10.3% surge assured that 60.5% of investors who purchased about $16,500 made a profit.</strong></p>



<p>The supply in profit percentage was on track to produce a negative divergence before the positive advance. <strong>This was in contrast to the 48% loss </strong>seen between November 2022 and January 1, 2023.</p>



<p>Following the development, Bitcoin&#8217;s social metrics reached new heights. <strong>According to Santiment, social dominance decreased to 8.77% on January 6 but had risen to 14.74% at the time of publication.</strong></p>



<p>Similarly, <strong>the social volume followed the pattern, rising to 8706</strong>. However, at the time of writing, <strong>the volume had dropped to 2379</strong>. This signified that BTC has captured a sizable portion of the crypto community&#8217;s attention. However, the drop in volume indicated a diminished hunt for the currency.</p>

<p>The move was followed by a further retreat from the market&#8217;s severe fear side, as shown by the <strong>Bitcoin fear </strong>and <strong>greed index</strong>. At the time of publication, the index had moved somewhat closer to<strong> the neutral point of 30</strong>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Bitcoin has the potential to push the rest of the market higher. Unfortunately,<strong> this was to the detriment of shorts</strong>, who accounted for a major portion of the liquidations over the past 24 hours.</p>



<h1 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" style="font-size:32px">Can BTC hit $20,000?</h1>



<p>Despite the pullback to $18,100, <strong>the Directional Movement Index (DMI) predicted that BTC may increase further</strong>. This was due to the positive DMI (blue) being so high at 48.09.</p>



<p>However, according to the trend of the Average Directional Index, <strong>a push toward $20,000 may be difficult to achieve (ADX)</strong>. If the ADX (pink) was at 25 or above, it would have supported the probability. Instead, <strong>it remained at 22.39</strong>.</p>

<p>According to an announcement made <strong>on January 12</strong>, the <a href="https://news.coincu.com/159395-huobis-market-share-is-declining/">cryptocurrency exchange Huobi</a> would delist the following<strong> 33 tokens: </strong>ABT, ATP, APN, AST, DIE, DHT, DFA, EDEN, GEAR, HC, INDI, IOI, INV, IRIS, GCOIN, GOF, KMA, MTA, NAS, OPUL, PEARL, PRIMATE, QASH, SMT, SLC, SKU, SOC, TALK</p>



<p>According to a statement made, &#8220;The above notice will <strong>take effect on January 16</strong>, the aforementioned coins will cease to be traded, and they will be permanently delisted.&#8221; Huobi stated that &#8220;the majority of these tokens breached <strong>Section 17, Rule 1 and Section 17, Rule 2 of the platform&#8217;s token management laws</strong>&#8221; while discussing the rationale for the delisting.</p>



<p>Because of major <strong>infractions of restrictions</strong>, a number of tokens were removed from circulation. Others fall short of the <strong>daily trading volume threshold of $50,000</strong>, which some don&#8217;t even come close to meeting. One of the reasons for the delisting was because of this.</p>

<p>According to the exchange, a further significant cause is that many of <strong>these projects have not updated their quarterly reports on time</strong>, have not updated their semi-monthly reports twice in a row compared to the plan, or even have not updated. <strong>within 7 days</strong> of being told of the need to do so.</p>



<p>Huobi is currently one of the most prominent cryptocurrency exchanges available today. Huobi consistently ranks among the top exchanges in terms of the overall trading volume that it processes in a given day. Huobi has recently announced that it intends to dismiss approximately twenty percent of its workforce as a result of the challenging scenario presented by the decline.</p>

<p>Microsoft&#8217;s <strong>$10 billion investment</strong> will increase the <strong>San Francisco-based AI research firm&#8217;s valuation to $29 billion</strong>, according to Semafor news agency, citing sources familiar with the situation. Microsoft will keep <strong>75% of OpenAI&#8217;s income</strong> until the initial investment is repaid. Once the initial payment is withdrawn, Microsoft will <strong>own 49% of the company</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>In 2015</strong>, entrepreneur and programmer <strong>Sam Altman</strong>, Tesla founder <strong>Elon Musk</strong>, computer scientists <strong>Ilya Sutskever</strong>, <strong>Wojciech Zaremba</strong>, <strong>John Schulman</strong>, and researcher <strong>Greg Brockman</strong> formed OpenAI. ChatGPT, an AI-powered chatbot that attracted over a million users in <strong>the first five days of its launch</strong>, is being positioned as a potential competitor to search engines such as Google. Crypto enthusiasts and traders have utilized <strong>ChatGPT</strong> to conduct research, build trading bots, and assist developers with code.</p>

<p>Microsoft changed<a href="https://news.coincu.com/152354-microsoft-bans-crypto-mining/"> its policy conditions</a> <strong>on December 12</strong> to indicate that crypto mining is not authorized on its online services without prior approval. The upgrade <strong>prohibits users from mining</strong> on the company&#8217;s internet services, including the Azure cloud platform. The upgrade was announced <strong>on December 1</strong>.</p>



<p>The change was characterized as one of several steps made to &#8220;<strong>protect the partner ecosystem,&#8221;</strong> referring to partner organizations that try to sign up software clients to Azure&#8217;s cloud services. The acceptable usage policy&#8217;s new universal licensing requirements indicate that neither customers nor those who access an Online Service through a customer may use an Online Service to mine bitcoin without the company&#8217;s prior written approval.</p>

<p>He denied taking funds and asserted that the collapse of FTX and its sister company Alameda Research was caused <strong>by the fall of the cryptocurrency market and insufficient hedging on Alameda&#8217;s side.</strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;I didn’t steal funds, and I certainly didn’t stash billions away. Nearly all of my assets were and still are utilizable to backstop FTX customers.

<p>According to court documents, Bankman-Fried <a href="https://news.coincu.com/154618-ftx-seeks-help-ownership-robinhood-shares/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wants to keep ownership </a>of the nearly <strong>56 million Robinhood shares</strong> in order to pay his legal bills.

<p>He asserted that, in the wake of the company&#8217;s bankruptcy, there was a way for clients of specific FTX enterprises to be made whole. The former CEO claimed that <strong>FTX US</strong> had <strong>$350 million</strong> <strong>in cash</strong> on hand and was fully solvent when the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.</p>



<p>Bankman-Fried is currently free on bail at his parents&#8217; California home despite being charged with many federal offenses, including conspiracy to commit fraud. Although FTX co-founder<strong> Gary Wang </strong>and Alameda CEO <strong>Caroline Ellison </strong>pleaded guilty to fraud charges and are now helping an investigation in the Southern District of New York, <strong>he has pleaded not guilty to the accusations.</strong></p>

<p>Prior to the company&#8217;s bankruptcy, Bankman-Fried claimed that <strong>the legal firm Sullivan &amp; Crowell and the FTX US general counsel exerted pressure on him to appoint John Ray as the new CEO of FTX</strong>, disturbing an apparent plan to make impacted users substantially whole.</p>



<p>He attributed a big portion of FTX&#8217;s failure to the 2022 crypto market meltdown and <strong>Changpeng Zhao</strong>, CEO of Binance, who waged a months-long PR campaign against FTX.</p>



<p>In three places in his note, Bankman-Fried referred to Binance&#8217;s early November announcement to remove cash from Alameda as <strong>a targeted attack since it caused a run on the FTX market.</strong></p>

<h5><strong>A new Lightning Network node in Nigeria is motivating Africans to adopt Bitcoin.</strong></h5>



<p><strong>Lightning Network (LN) </strong>has been around for a while, but its adoption in rural places is still a long way off. However, the city of Nigeria, Lagos, just received its<strong> first </strong><a href="https://news.coincu.com/159303-bitcoin-is-a-decentralized-ponzi-scheme/"><strong>Bitcoin</strong></a><strong> Lightning Network node</strong>, a significant step toward better linking the continent to a Bitcoin-based layer 2 payment network.</p>



<p>Megasley, who runs the country&#8217;s LLightning Network node, revealed his idea for<strong> delivering low-cost, rapid payments to Africa</strong> with the solution. He stated that his purpose is to assist Africans in <strong>receiving rapid and free money</strong>.</p>



<p>&#8220;The optimal trading experience would be provided if a Bitcoin holder and a retailer in Nigeria are both linked to an LN node operating in the nation.&#8221;</p>



<p>Megasley is presently<strong> the sole active LN node operator</strong> on the map in Nigeria, according to Bitcoin blockchain discovery platforms<strong> Mempool and Amboss</strong>. By spinning the node, he will make LN payments as available to Africans as feasible.</p>

<p>When asked about<strong> the need of developing a worldwide network</strong> of nodes to allow Bitcoin payments, Megasley commented: &#8220;If Bitcoin is to flourish, it has to become a better, easier, faster medium of exchange than its incumbents. To accomplish this, we must establish a global network of nodes to support these payments.&#8221;</p>



<p>Finally, Megasley cited Bitcoin as <strong>a big perspective shift in Africa</strong>, despite the argument that BTC is an overly volatile asset. &#8220;People often talk about Bitcoin volatility, but this is nothing when you live in a place where your money may easily lose half its value in a year.</p>



<p>Money in Africa is controlled by <strong>irresponsible individuals</strong>, which is why <strong>Bitcoin is required</strong>. We will deprive them of their financial power, allowing the African people to realize their full potential.&#8221;</p>



<p>However, the installation of a Lightning Network node in Nigeria is a key step toward growing cryptocurrency accessibility and adoption in the country and across the continent. Nigeria has also launched its national digital currency CBDC, which has over 270,000 active users. The Central Bank of Nigeria imposed a cap on ATM withdrawals in the country to encourage consumers to use CBDC more.</p>

The government of this country has issued a directive requiring all<strong> internet service providers (ISPs)</strong> in the country to prohibit &#8220;<strong>websites, applications or online networks</strong>&#8221; involved with virtual currency.</p>



<p><strong>In September of 2021</strong>, the country&#8217;s central bank issued a decree that <strong>prohibited any activity involving cryptocurrencies</strong>, including trading and mining for new cryptocurrencies. <strong>In April 2022</strong>, the authority in charge of Nepal&#8217;s telecommunications <strong>urged the general public for information against illicit activities</strong>, such as cryptocurrency trading.</p>

<p>Should any <strong>crypto-related activity</strong> take place on an email service provider&#8217;s platform, the provider could find itself in legal hot water. According to the notification, illegal transactions in the country that include cryptocurrencies &#8220;<strong>have been on the rise in recent times</strong>.&#8221;</p>



<p>In spite of the restrictions, Nepal is now rated <strong>16th on Chainalysis&#8217;s 2022 Global Crypto Acceptance Index.</strong> This places Nepal higher on the index than countries such as the United Kingdom and Indonesia.</p>



<p>Base on a report that was compiled by the <strong>Library of Congress</strong>, Nepal is one of nine countries (along with China, Algeria, Bangladesh, Egypt, Iraq, Morocco, Qatar, and Tunisia) that have <strong>entirely prohibited the use of cryptocurrencies</strong>. Other countries on this list include Bangladesh, Egypt, Iraq, Morocco, Qatar, and Tunisia. Bangladesh, Egypt, Iraq, Morocco, Qatar, and Tunisia are some of the other countries that are included on this list.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The global group of central bankers recommended three options to tackle dangers in crypto markets, including banning, containing and regulating.</em></li>



<li><em>Central banks might create their own digital currency to encourage sound innovation, according to BIS research.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>Following a particularly volatile year, the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) says that authorities can adopt one of three approaches to cryptocurrency: regulate, contain, or call for a complete ban of the sector.</strong></h5>

<p>The BIS underlined the benefits and cons of each of the three techniques, noting that <strong>they could be combined and matched to address different risks</strong>. The primary incidents noted were the ongoing story surrounding the collapse of FTX and the breakdown of the stablecoin TerraUSD.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">Without such gateways, crypto would have to rely on users taking self-custody of their funds in digital wallets using private keys. Given the risks involved, mainstream adoption would be inconceivable.</p>
<cite>The report said</cite></blockquote>



<p><strong>Banning crypto activities would be an extreme option that would impede innovation</strong>. The BIS admits that prohibiting borderless decentralized activity is problematic. A prohibition on centralized middlemen might be more effective, but it may shift such operations to another state.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">In terms of pros, and assuming that a ban is effective, any potential harm to the financial system would be eliminated and investors would not incur any losses due to misconduct on the part of crypto service providers. The main downside is that any useful innovation from crypto would be lost or delayed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Other options include <strong>isolating cryptocurrency</strong> <strong>from traditional financial economies</strong> and <strong>regulating the industry in a manner similar to the financial services sector.</strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">If this option is successfully pursued, problems stemming from and propagating within the crypto markets would not damage TradFi. Importantly, this option would avoid giving crypto a “seal of approval”, which might encourage its growth.</p>

<p>The exchange has a total cash worth of <strong>$285 million,</strong> according to CoinGabbar, a crypto asset tracking platform and WazirX PoR publisher. About <strong>92%</strong> of total, or<strong> $259.07 million</strong>, is <strong>held in the </strong><a href="https://news.coincu.com/159301-over-2-million-in-ldo-is-transferred/"><strong>Binance</strong></a><strong> wallet</strong>, with the remaining<strong> $26.45 million</strong> held in other exchanges. </p>



<p>This statement is significant because,<strong> in August 2022</strong>, co-founder Nischal Shetty and CEO Changpeng Zhao engaged in a public Twitter spat over who controls WazirX. In particular, WazirX was<strong> bought by Binance in 2019</strong>. By August 2022, Mr. Changpeng Zhao stirred uproar with the surprising declaration that &#8220;<strong>Binance has never acquired WazirX&#8221;</strong>.</p>



<p>As a result, CZ revealed that he had agreed to <strong>invest in Zanmai Labs</strong>, but that<strong> the share transfer was never completed.</strong> WazirX has merely turned up the domain name and access to the <strong>AWS server,</strong> according to CZ&#8217;s statement, adding that the exchange has no authority over<strong> registration, KYC, or withdrawals.</strong></p>

<p>Vice president Rajagopal Menon commented on <strong>the amount of WazirX reserves in the Binance wallet</strong>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;The holdings in Binance sub-accounts belong to WazirX but are held by Binance,&#8221; said Sudeep Saxena, co-founder of CoinGabbar. Binance&#8217;s adherence to the reserve is required for these monies to be valid. The ones we have documented have proof of reserve, just like other exchanges like as CoinDCX and SunCrypto.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&#8220;<strong>Binance is trusted</strong> to deliver wallet services as a technology solution for numerous enterprises,&#8221; stated a spokeswoman for the company. The platform&#8217;s Binance account will be controlled and operated by Zanmai, who employs our wallet service for WazirX activities.&#8221;</p>



<p>Following the thread of the story, it can be seen that Binance continues to disassociate and disclaim liability from this platform, the exchange whose assets were frozen by Indian authorities as part of an investigation into money laundering charges. When it comes to regulating operations, it chose to communicate with the firm&#8217;s parent company Zanmai.</p>



<p>Binance currently holds almost <strong>19% of this Indian platform&#8217;s customer funds as SHIB, with 9.37% ETH and 8.28% BTC.</strong></p>
