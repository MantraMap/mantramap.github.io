		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crypto market is constantly changing and evolving, making it difficult to keep track of the latest trends. Recently, a new trend has emerged that could potentially disrupt the market—the emergence of the </span>Orbeon Protocol, the crypto darkhorse that has seen price climb 805% <span style="font-weight: 400;">and the exodus of holders from projects such as Chiliz and Cardano.</span></p>
<h2><b>Chiliz (CHZ)</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chiliz is a blockchain-based platform that provides an easy and secure way to access, manage, and trade digital fan tokens. Chiliz has become increasingly popular among sports fans around the world who are looking for a more engaging experience with their favourite teams or athletes. Chiliz allows users to buy, sell and exchange these tokens and receive rewards for participating in activities on the platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the main advantages of Chiliz is its easy accessibility and user-friendly interface. It allows users to quickly buy, sell and exchange fan tokens with ease. Additionally, Chiliz provides fans with a more engaging experience when supporting their favourite teams or athletes. It does so by offering incentives for participating in activities on the platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, however, Chiliz has seen some holders move away from the project towards Orbeon Protocol. Since the last crash, crypto investors have been moving away from sports and celebrity buzz into real utility. This trend is expected to continue, which is why Chiliz could drop.</span></p>
<h2><b>Cardano (ADA)</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cardano (ADA) is a smart contract platform developed by an Ethereum cofounder Charles Hoskinson in 2015. Cardano’s (ADA) platform is capable of executing sophisticated financial contracts. Cardano (ADA) also allows users to create decentralized applications (DApps) on its open-source platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cardano has been gaining traction in the crypto market due to its strong technical capabilities and potential use cases. Like other major smart contract platforms, some have called Cardano (ADA) the “Ethereum killer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, however, Cardano has been losing its holders. Long-time Cardano holders are complaining about slow development and uninspiring features. Additionally, the recent crypto crash has made institutional money wary of holding risky crypto bets. </span></p>
<h2><b>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN)</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orbeon Protocol is a venture capital and crowdsourcing platform that helps projects raise funds through token sales. Orbeon Protocol provides an easy way for users to invest in innovative projects while also allowing startups to access new funding sources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orbeon Protocol&#8217;s mission is to make investing in cryptocurrency easier and more accessible by creating a secure environment where users can purchase tokens with confidence. Orbeon Protocol leverages blockchain technology to provide investors with unprecedented transparency. This helps protect investors from potential scams or fraudulent activities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, it allows startups to access a greater pool of capital. Through its advanced technology and user-friendly interface, it provides both investors and startup founders with an efficient way of raising money from the crypto market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orbeon Protocol’s presale has been gaining a lot of traction recently due to the impressive performance of its tokens. </span>Experts expect a surge of 6000% for Orbeon Protocol by the end of the presale.</p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin (BTC) is enduring one of the most testing periods in its history. Undoubtedly, the most valuable cryptocurrency lost a significant portion of its value due to numerous crises that almost brought the token to its knees. After hitting $69,000 in November 2021, a figure representing its all-time high, BTC lost about 75% of its value this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But 2022 was a disappointing year for BTC and the crypto space at large. Following the crypto boom of 2021, many tipped the industry to enjoy a prosperous year. Notable predictions for this year included a $100,000 value for BTC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, the sharp decline didn&#8217;t happen due to a direct issue with BTC itself. Instead, multiple micro and macro factors influenced it. </span></p>

	</div>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first significant factor was the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Before the Russian action, BTC began the year on a $47,000 price note. Three months into the conflict, BTC had </span><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plummeted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to $28,000. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, a sharp decline came into play due to the rising inflation occasioned by the increasing energy price across Europe. In a bid to soften Russia&#8217;s resolve, the West came up with numerous sanctions that also included its refusal to trade with Russia for gas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The collapse of Terra&#8217;s LUNA and UST also strongly impacted firms in the crypto space and BTC. Many businesses with an investment in LUNA halted the withdrawal of users&#8217; funds and consequently filed for bankruptcy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The collapse of LUNA and its algorithm stablecoin UST </span><a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/ftx-investor-impact-less-than-previous-crises/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">resulted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a loss of $53 billion in users&#8217; funds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The eventual </span><a href="https://dailycoin.com/tag/ftx-collapse/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">collapse of FTX</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> further affected crypto firms and investors, therefore impacting BTC&#8217;s price stability. Alongside the disasters mentioned above, inflation continues to battle economies across the globe. </span></p>

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Inflation continued to hit hard, the U.S Federal Reserve Board, alongside other apex financial institutions, launched an assault to battle it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On four occasions this year, the Fed </span><a href="https://dailycoin.com/federal-reserve-raises-interest-rates-by-75-basis-points-for-the-fourth-consecutive-time/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hiked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its interest rate to discourage more spending by individuals and businesses. Fed chair Jerome Powell echoed the position of the Fed to keep increasing the interest till inflation drops to 2%. Logically, the more the interest rate increases, the more inflation drops. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, the inflation rate in the US is way above the target of the Fed. According to the </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category-line-chart.htm" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bureau of Labor </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statistics, prices rose 7.1% annually in November, down from 7.7% in October. In a new move against the prevailing inflation, the Federal Reserve </span><a href="https://dailycoin.com/fed-raises-interest-rates-by-50bps-to-highest-since-2007/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its rates by 50bps, resulting in a new high since 2007. </span></p>

			<h2><b>Impact of the Increasing Fed Rate on BTC and its Investors&#8217; Reactions</b></h2>

	</div>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rising interest rates can have a direct impact on the price stability of BTC. With the increase in interest rates, access to credit becomes more expensive. This will manifest in a reluctant approach for individuals as they receive a minimal return when they take debt to purchase assets. Therefore, reducing the exploits of individuals to buy assets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For BTC, the cryptocurrency trades as a risk asset, so it&#8217;s likely that higher rates can spell more doom for its price. The interest rate will reduce the demand for BTC, causing its value to dip further. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the recent decline in BTC price, according to statistics by Glassnode, long-term holders remain bullish on BTC. They currently hold more than </span><a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=BTC&amp;category=&amp;m=supply.LthSum&amp;s=1513130486&amp;u=1670810486&amp;zoom=1825" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">13.908 million BTC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is a record high. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite BTC going down more in November after the FTX collapse, retail investors holding less than one Bitcoin still added 96.2k to their holdings as of Nov. 28, a record increase.</span></p>

This figure indicates that despite the general downturn of crypto assets, BTC managed to pull a better market performance than other tech stocks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BTC&#8217;s limited supply and decentralization made it a good hedge against inflation. In addition, the predetermined circulation of BTC implies that there will be no excess supply, helping it keep inflation at bay. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, BTC&#8217;s production/mining rate is designed to drop by 50% every four years. With that, BTC will become more scarce and less vulnerable to inflation.</span></p>

It has also outperformed stable assets like gold in certain circumstances.

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BitDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that supports DeFi projects through research and development, token swaps, and grants. It aims to build a decentralized tokenized economy that is available to everybody.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BitDAO hopes to support several projects in decentralized finance (DeFi), DAOs, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and gaming through research and development, liquidity bootstrapping, and funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of BitDAO’s primary aims is to attract developer talent via token swaps and co-development efforts. In addition to supporting other projects, BitDAO aims to build core products that will help the functionality and effectiveness of BitDAO and other DAOs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BitDAO is not a company, so it does not focus on profit generation. BIT is a tradeable governance token of the BitDAO ecosystem. The Ethereum-based token carries proposal and voting power for users to make decisions.</span></p>

The </span><a href="https://discourse.bitdao.io/t/discussion-bit-purchase-program-update-jan-2023/4373" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BIP-18: $BIT Purchase Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is currently being voted on by community members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal will see the BitDAO team purchase $2 million in USDT worth of BIT for 50 consecutive days, starting on January 1st, 2023.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal also extends DAO’s capital deployment strategy and previous buyback schemes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recommended priorities for BitDAO capital deployment include high priority for BIT-related products and low priority for swaps and investments, as well as yield strategies. BitDAO currently holds assets to cover at least five years of BIT product development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the buyback scheme would increase the BIT holding of BitDAO, the project remains DAO with the biggest treasury without their token. As of December 5th, BitDAO&#8217;s </span><a href="https://twitter.com/DeepDAO_io/status/1599786820731998208" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reserve was valued</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at over $766 million – more than three and a half times the second DAO on the list.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ByBit, one of the world’s leading crypto exchanges, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Bybit_Official/status/1605183341795643393" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on December 20th that it had made a $66 million contribution to BitDAO through the month of November. It has also been a major player in the monthly burning of BIT tokens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the beginning of December, the BitDAO team announced the soft launch of a modular Ethereum Layer-2 (L2) network called Mantle. BitDAO hopes to use Mantle to bolster lower fees and fast transactions on the Ethereum network.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2022 will be a year to forget for the virtual assets sphere. Following the industry&#8217;s impressive growth in 2021, many predicted 2022 would also be prosperous. Some analysts even tipped BTC to hit a $100k price mark. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, throughout the year, the sphere suffered numerous setbacks. Setbacks that held back the industry&#8217;s growth and placed one of the most challenging tasks before it &#8211; rebuilding investors&#8217; trust.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the numerous crises that made 2022 a miserable year for the industry is the sudden </span><a href="https://dailycoin.com/tag/terra-collapse/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">collapse of Terra</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and FTX. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The demise of the two projects hugely impacted the virtual assets sector, almost crumbling it. This is due to the huge influence of the two projects and the dependency of numerous firms on Terra and FTX.</span></p>

			<h2><strong>Firms Within the Blasting Radius of Terra&#8217;s Demise</strong></h2>

		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The whole Terra crisis started on May 7, 2022, when the price of the default algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD (UST) fell rapidly to 35 cents. UST is supposed to maintain a $1 peg. This sudden fall led to UST&#8217;s companion token, LUNA, slipping from $80 to below $1. The decline of the two tokens of Terra labs initiated what turned out to be a massacre of crypto firms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to blockchain analytics firm </span><a href="https://www.nansen.ai/research/on-chain-forensics-demystifying-terrausd-de-peg" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nansen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, seven addresses exploited the Terra ecosystem&#8217;s weaknesses to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities due to the low liquidity of the Curve (CRV) pools supporting the TerraUSD (UST) peg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The perpetrators transferred Terra UST to Ethereum and exchanged them for other stablecoins in Curve&#8217;s liquidity pools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nansen noted that some of the discovered wallets were able to benefit from price disparities on Curve and decentralized and centralized exchanges throughout the collapse of UST.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the fall of Terra, crypto lender Celsius halted withdrawals due to its heavy stakes in LUNA. However, before then, Celsius had already promised depositors a 17% annum return and hoped to realize a 20% interest with the investment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, Three Arrows Capital (3AC), a cryptocurrency hedge fund based in Singapore, </span><a href="https://dailycoin.com/3ac-crypto-hedge-fund-collapses-virgin-islands-court-orders-liquidation/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suffered</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> due to the demise of LUNA as the firm invested more than $200 million in the token. According to </span><a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/ftx-investor-impact-less-than-previous-crises/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chainalysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the collapse of Celsius and 3AC cost investors about $33 billion. Meanwhile, the 3AC collapse affected Voyager due to its unsecured loan to the former. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another victim of the demise was Hashed, a Terra-supporting venture fund in Seoul, South Korea. The estimated loss of the firm was about $3.5 billion. Further, BlockFi was on the verge of bankruptcy due to the crisis of 3AC, but the firm got a saving grace from FTX. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crisis of FTX affected over one million users. The FTX collapse started after Binance announced the sale of its portion of FTT tokens, citing a deficit in FTX&#8217;s sister company, Alameda. Many firms halted withdrawals in their platforms after FTX mismanagement of funds became public. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, BlockFi is another firm that suffered casualties due to the FTX collapse, as it had received a $400 million credit facility from the crypto exchange.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to reports from the bankruptcy proceedings of FTX, it became established that the downfall of the cryptocurrency exchange claimed about $9 billion of users&#8217; funds.

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mr. Park Mo, Vice President of Vident, the largest shareholder firm of Bithumb, committed suicide in his home on Friday morning, according to local </span><a href="https://m.mt.co.kr/renew/view.html?no=2022123011073638881&amp;type=outlink&amp;ref=https%3A%2F%2Ftokeninsight.com" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deceased faced investigations from prosecutors in South Korea over alleged embezzlement and manipulation of stock prices belonging to Bithumb affiliates. The affiliates of the crypto exchange include Vident, Inbiogen, and Bucket Studio. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October, the prosecutors commenced investigations after suspicion that Park and his accomplice amassed illicit gains from the manipulative act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While in his capacity as the Vice President of Vident, Park allegedly took charge of the accounting operations of Bithumb. He held this position under the leadership of the sister and brother of Mr. Kang Ji-yeon, who claimed to be chairman of the crypto exchange. Reportedly, these individuals conspired with Park to issue convertible bonds, initiating slush funds and amassing illicit profits.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the South Korean prosecutor has vowed to investigate the circumstances surrounding the death of the Vice President. The agency noted that the death of Mr. Park wouldn&#8217;t deter its unrelenting commitment to seeing the investigation to a logical end. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the prosecutor, the executives of the crypto exchange have, over time, made vicious efforts to frustrate the investigation. In November, one of the executives of Bithumb affiliates allegedly concealed and destroyed evidence capable of aiding the investigation ahead of the search and seizure conducted by the prosecutor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kang is currently facing a separate </span><a href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20221025098200004" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">trial</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over his alleged involvement in the fraud. Recently, BK group chairman Kim Byung-gun accused Kang of defrauding him in a $70 million takeover deal of the crypto exchange. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Byung-gun alleged that he paid $70 million as an initial payment to buy Bithumb. He said Kang, as part of the negotiations, </span><a href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/07/602_311706.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">promised</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to list BXA,  a token belonging to Blockchain Exchange Alliance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Bithumb, through Kang, allegedly failed to list the token for financial reasons, leading those who bought the coins expecting the acquisition to sue him. This put the chairman at risk of an eight-year jail term if found guilty of the allegations.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a year that saw </span><a href="https://twitter.com/chainalysis/status/1580312149557026817" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 125 hacks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, these ten hacks alone represent over 66% of the money lost. According to a </span><a href="https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1587112410082512897" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Peckshield, October was the month which saw the highest number of hacks, with over 53 protocols affected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The increase in hacks has also led to increased regulatory actions, with the US Treasury’s OFAC using sanctions to go after threat actors. Following the Ronin bridge attack, OFAC tracked the movement of stolen funds on the blockchain and discovered that North Korea’s Lazarus Group was behind it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mixing services like Tornado Cash also came under regulatory scrutiny. Hackers have used them to </span><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0916" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launder</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over a billion dollars. Earlier this year, the founder of Tornado Cash was </span><a href="https://dailycoin.com/tornado-cash-developer-to-stay-behind-bars-until-february/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">arrested</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> following the US Treasury’s ban on the protocol. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been a year since multiple projects succumbed to different attacks and exploits, highlighting the industry’s need to build more robust products. </span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mega-popular canine crypto Shiba Inu (SHIB) was one of the most noticeable players in the crypto sphere in 2022. SHIB <a href="https://dailycoin.com/shiba-inu-shib-metrics-reveal-shib-is-seen-as-long-term-investment/?swcfpc=1" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="noopener noreferrer">counted a steadily growing total wallet number</a> every day in 2022, even amid an intense bear market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the SHIB Army, which is the community behind the mememecoin, grew stronger every day, bit by bit. The self-proclaimed <em>“Dogecoin Killer”</em> managed to catch up with the top dog memecoin in Twitter followers, even though SHIB is seven years younger than DOGE. Five top yearly moments worth reminiscing ultimately helped SHIB take a step closer to the moon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per the statement, the assets were seized on November 12th after Sam Bankman-Fried announced that the exchange was being attacked. FTX would report in its bankruptcy filing that $372 million worth of tokens were stolen from the exchange on November 11th.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain research firm Nansen reported that amidst the “hack,” FTX recorded crypto outflows of over $700 million within 24 hours.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solana (SOL) has been crushed by the unprecedented drop in price since the fallout of FTX. The once-dubbed “Ethereum killer” is down over 96% from its all-time high of almost $260, according to </span><a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/solana" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from CoinGecko.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last few weeks have been extra tough for Solana. On-chain investigators pointed out a few days ago that the wallets associated with Alameda Research, Sam Bankman-Fried’s, also known as SBF, a hedge fund that received billions of dollars in customer funds from FTX, are dumping SOL for other tokens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This has made SOL lose another 20% of its value in the past week and fall under $9 – a price not seen since almost two years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More importantly, Solana’s future as a blockchain is also at stake. Multiple projects have announced in the past two months that they’re moving to other chains, like Ethereum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent Solana developments beg the question: Why are Solana-based projects leaving it? Can Solana recover? Or is it the beginning of the end?</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the recent few weeks, multiple Solana-based projects announced their intention to go cross-chain or leave Solana altogether. For example, Solana’s largest NFT marketplace Magic Eden said it’s going to go cross-chain and integrate with Polygon, an Ethereum Layer-2 blockchain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But perhaps the most painful departure was that of the two most prominent NFT projects – DeGods and y00ts. Both of them </span><a href="https://dailycoin.com/degods-and-y00ts-to-wave-farewell-to-solana-and-migrate-to-ethereum-and-polygon-in-2023/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have gone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Ethereum, with y00ts, like Magic Eden, integrating with Polygon. This has been a big blow to the otherwise strong Solana NFT community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why leave in such haste? Perhaps it all goes back to disgraced crypto baron SBF and his involvement in Solana as an investor and unofficial spokesperson. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBF’s FTX and Alameda bought large sums of SOL tokens from the non-profit Solana Foundation and Solana Labs, the firm developing the blockchain. The FTX balance sheet leaked days before the exchange filed for bankruptcy showed that it had almost $1 billion in SOL, though it’s unclear how much Alameda had.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBF also was big on Solana ecosystem projects like Serum (SRM), a decentralized exchange, and MAPS.me (MAPS), which aimed to become a decentralized version of Google Maps. FTX also had both of these projects’ tokens, worth around $3 billion, on its balance sheet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solana is known for being less decentralized than its rival Ethereum, with the majority of SOL tokens having been allocated to insiders and venture capitalists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the FTX house of cards has begun to crumble and spicy details start coming out, perhaps innocent Solana projects no longer want to be associated with SBF’s favorite blockchain. On top of that, Solana is also known for frequently going down – something developers and users aren’t the biggest fans of.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But is it all doom and gloom? Is Solana really done? Is it another EOS? It doesn’t look like it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Messari </span><a href="https://twitter.com/MessariCrypto/status/1604506809615556609" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that despite SOL tanking by 96%, the number of developer repos on GitHub and daily unique programs have both increased by 2.5 times since the start of the year. A </span><a href="https://www.alchemy.com/blog/web3-developer-report-q3-2022?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=announcement&amp;utm_campaign=Developer%20report" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published by Alchemy a few weeks ago showed a 1000% growth in active developer teams year-on-year and more than 500% growth in API consumption year-to-date.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Solana developer community even got a shoutout from Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum. He </span><a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1608591727316684804" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> yesterday on Twitter that he hopes Solana’s “community gets its fair chance to survive.”</span></p>
<pre>“Some smart people tell me there is an earnest smart developer community in Solana, and now that the awful opportunistic money people have been washed out, the chain has a bright future. Hard for me to tell from outside, but I hope the community gets its fair chance to thrive,” Vitalik said.</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, some compare Solana’s fall from grace to what Ethereum experienced in 2018 and earlier. While the two chains have differences, ETH dropped around 80% during the last few bear markets and saw the world turn against it. However, it has returned from the “dead” multiple times and continued to innovate throughout bear and bull markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it’s impossible to say for certain what the future holds for Solana, it doesn’t look like the blockchain is on life support – at least for now.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solana is the so-called “Ethereum killer”, claiming it offers faster transaction speeds and lower fees. If Solana can survive this bear market and retain its developer community, it can be one of the winners of the next bull market.</span></p>
