<p>This achievement underscores the growing popularity and adoption of NFTs within the cryptocurrency community.</p>



<p>The Bitcoin NFT protocol has been gaining traction as a revolutionary way to tokenize and represent unique digital assets, ranging from digital art and collectibles to virtual real estate and gaming items. The exponential growth in the number of mintings reflects the increasing interest and confidence in NFTs as a valuable digital asset class.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2212.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="288" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2212-1024x288.png" alt="Minting Ordinals Inscriptions Surpass 20 Million Mark!" class="wp-image-207077" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2212-1024x288.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2212-300x84.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2212-768x216.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2212-1536x432.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2212-2048x576.png 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2212-750x211.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2212-1140x321.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Minting Ordinals Inscriptions Surpass 20 Million Mark! 2"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Furthermore, the cumulative fee income generated from these mintings has reached a remarkable 1,863,9396 BTC, which is approximately equivalent to a staggering $54.5433 million. This substantial income demonstrates the economic viability and potential profitability of NFTs for creators, collectors, and investors alike.</p>

<p>The surge in minting activity and fee income showcases the Bitcoin NFT protocol&#8217;s robustness and scalability, capable of handling a vast number of transactions with efficiency and security. The protocol&#8217;s ability to process such a significant volume of mintings is a testament to the underlying blockchain&#8217;s strength and the community&#8217;s trust in the platform.</p>

<p>NFTs have emerged as a transformative force in the art, gaming, and entertainment industries, enabling creators to tokenize and sell their work directly to collectors without intermediaries. This decentralized approach empowers artists and content creators, allowing them to retain more control over their creations and receive fair compensation for their artistry.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Alameda Research seeks support from GBTC shareholders in a lawsuit against Grayscale and DCG.</em></li>



<li><em>The lawsuit alleges share redemption prevention and excessive fees.</em></li>



<li><em>Grayscale faces legal pressure amid wider GBTC discount.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In an ongoing legal battle, Alameda Research, a cryptocurrency investment firm that is currently facing bankruptcy, is <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/661579480/Motion-for-a-One-Week-Extension" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">calling</a> on shareholders holding at least 10% of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to participate in its lawsuit against Grayscale Investments and its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG).</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2209-1024x683.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2209-1024x683.png" alt="Alameda Urges GBTC Shareholders Holding At Least 10% To Join Lawsuit Against Grayscale" class="wp-image-207071" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2209-1024x683.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2209-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2209-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2209-750x500.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2209.png 1098w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Alameda Urges GBTC Shareholders Holding At Least 10% To Join Lawsuit Against Grayscale 5"></a></figure></div>


<p>The initial lawsuit was filed by <a href="https://coincu.com/204571-former-alameda-co-ceo-admits-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alameda</a> against Grayscale in March, accusing the crypto investment management company of preventing shareholders from redeeming Bitcoin and Ethereum trust shares and imposing excessive management fees.</p>



<p>Now, Alameda has revealed its intention to file an amended complaint against <a href="https://coincu.com/206678-grayscale-sec-concurrent-approval-bitcoin-etfs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grayscale</a>, aiming to add additional plaintiffs who own a minimum of 10% of the outstanding shares of GBTC. The firm is in talks with several GBTC shareholders who are willing to join as co-plaintiffs, but an additional five days have been requested to confirm their participation and contribute to the amended complaints.</p>



<p>Recently, Bitcoin Magazine CEO David Bailey <a href="https://twitter.com/davidfbailey/status/1684725681828028416" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">urged</a> GBTC shareholders to register on RedeemGBTC.com and become part of the lawsuit, emphasizing that the outcome would affect all shareholders and determine their position as investors or hostages in the dispute.</p>



<p>The initial lawsuit by Alameda Research <a href="https://coincu.com/171897-ftx-alameda-sues-gray-scale-dcg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused</a> Grayscale of enriching itself at the expense of shareholders due to its high fees and refusal to allow share redemptions from its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and Grayscale Ethereum Trust. The legal pressure adds to the challenges faced by DCG after its unit, Genesis Global Trading, experienced bankruptcy following the crypto market downturn.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2208.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="931" height="523" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2208.png" alt="Alameda Urges GBTC Shareholders Holding At Least 10% To Join Lawsuit Against Grayscale" class="wp-image-207070" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2208.png 931w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2208-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2208-768x431.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2208-750x421.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 931px) 100vw, 931px" title="Alameda Urges GBTC Shareholders Holding At Least 10% To Join Lawsuit Against Grayscale 6"></a></figure></div>


<p>Notably, last year, Grayscale <a href="https://coincu.com/201403-grayscale-opposes-sec-approval/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sued</a> the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) when the regulator rejected the company&#8217;s proposal to convert GBTC into an exchange-traded fund (ETF). Despite this, Grayscale continues to impose fees much higher than those typically paid to advisers on crypto-tied ETFs, as alleged by Alameda Research, causing significant financial harm to the firm.</p>



<p>In May, Grayscale sought to dismiss Alameda&#8217;s lawsuit, arguing that such allegations could only be brought by at least two unaffiliated shareholders owning a minimum of 10% of the Trusts&#8217; shares.</p>



<p>As the legal dispute unfolds, GBTC&#8217;s discount to its net asset value (NAV) has recently <a href="https://ycharts.com/companies/GBTC/discount_or_premium_to_nav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">widened</a> to 30.11%, after a period of narrowing earlier in the month. Grayscale is currently embroiled in a separate legal battle with the SEC over the approval of its plan to convert its Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. The outcome of these legal proceedings could have significant implications for both Grayscale and GBTC shareholders.</p>

<p>While Pierce noted that crypto firms and accountants should ensure transparency regarding proof of reserves, specifying what is and isn&#8217;t acceptable, she questioned why accounting firms should be cautious of providing assurance work to crypto firms. She believes that discouraging good-faith efforts to provide transparency is not an ideal approach to regulate the crypto industry.</p>

<p>Munter suggested that accounting firms adopt an all-or-nothing approach to engagements with crypto firms, as partial engagements might result in crypto firms selectively choosing only certain aspects of the business to show accounting firms and then presenting that information as a full audit to clients. Munter believes that such an approach will lack transparency for investors.</p>



<p>According to Munter, if an accounting firm discovers that a client is making misleading statements about its non-audit work to the public, it should take a firm stance and consider making a &#8220;noisy withdrawal, disassociating itself from the client, including by way of its own public statements,&#8221; or report the firm to the SEC.</p>



<p>Mike Shaub, an auditing and accounting ethics professor at Texas A&amp;M University, commented on the statement in a July 29 tweet. </p>

<p>He stated that auditors are bound by confidentiality, which makes it difficult to make public statements as Munter suggested. Shaub also highlighted the issue of some accounting firms aligning themselves with cryptocurrency expertise to boost their reputation but becoming unresponsive when problems surface. Overall, it is important to balance transparency and confidentiality while regulating the crypto industry.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Figure Technologies lays off 90 employees ahead of IPO.</em></li>



<li><em>The lending business shows strong financial performance.</em></li>



<li><em>The company remains optimistic about future prospects.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Blockchain-powered fintech start-up Figure Technologies Inc. has made significant strides in its financial performance despite facing challenges in the crypto industry. According to documents reviewed by <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-28/mike-cagney-s-figure-lays-off-20-of-staff-amid-ipo-plans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a></em>, the company recently laid off 90 employees, approximately 20% of its workforce, as it gears up for a planned initial public offering (IPO) for its lending business next year.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2203.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2203-1024x576.png" alt="Figure Lays Off 20% Employees, But Eyes Bright Future With Upcoming IPO" class="wp-image-207056" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2203-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2203-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2203-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2203-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2203-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2203.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Figure Lays Off 20% Employees, But Eyes Bright Future With Upcoming IPO 11"></a></figure></div>


<p>Figure Technologies was co-founded by Mike Cagney, the former CEO of Social Finance Inc. (SoFi), with the vision of leveraging <a href="https://coincu.com/205617-us-gao-urges-stronger-oversight-blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blockchain technology</a> to create innovative financial products. Like many other crypto-related start-ups, Figure had experienced talent loss and funding difficulties during an industry downturn.</p>



<p>However, the company&#8217;s financial milestones present a promising outlook. During the second quarter of the current year, Figure&#8217;s lending business achieved a record volume of $900 million. Additionally, the company reported $83.5 million in revenue in the first half of the year and generated $2.7 million in adjusted profit during the second quarter. According to a letter from Cagney to Figure investors and partners, the lending business demonstrated profitability with a more than 50% contribution margin.</p>



<p>Encouraged by the impressive performance, Figure is now looking to take its lending division, known as &#8220;LendCo,&#8221; public in early 2024. Cagney expressed optimism about achieving a $2.5 billion valuation for LendCo during the IPO, which would surpass the company&#8217;s last valuation of $3.2 billion in a venture-backed funding round in 2021.</p>



<p>Despite the positive developments, the recent layoffs raised concerns among some employees due to their timing. The meeting held to address these job cuts saw several inquiries considered too sensitive to address directly, according to documentation of the event. Approximately half of the laid-off employees were engineers.</p>

<p>In response to the layoffs, Senior Vice President of Engineering, Matt Conroy, sent a message on an internal Slack channel, urging remaining employees to be understanding of the company&#8217;s leadership. Conroy emphasized the bright future ahead, pointing to the strong performance during the first half of 2023 and ambitious goals for 2024. These goals include the planned IPO for LendCo and a potential IPO for their Markets business and other products.</p>



<p>In light of the tough market conditions earlier in the year, Figure Technologies is also seeking fresh funds to navigate through challenges. Reports suggest that the US-based fintech is actively searching for investors to raise up to $100 million. Additionally, the company is exploring the possibility of spinning off some of its businesses.</p>



<p>Figure Technologies employs its Provenance Blockchain to develop traditional financial services, such as lending and payments. While the company faced setbacks in previous attempts to raise funds and go public, the recent financial successes and strategic plans indicate a determined effort to thrive in the market.</p>



<p>Looking forward, remaining team members may be reassigned to new product groups in the coming weeks as Figure Technologies continues its journey toward growth and financial stability in the ever-evolving fintech landscape.</p>

<p>The bank aims to leverage the innovative Ripple Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) platform to tokenize properties and facilitate faster loan issuance using digital Hong Kong dollars. This move signals a major step towards modernizing the real estate industry and embracing the potential of blockchain technology.</p>



<p>Real estate tokenization involves converting the ownership of physical properties into digital tokens on a blockchain network. This process offers several advantages, such as increased liquidity, fractional ownership, and easier transferability. By utilizing the Ripple CBDC platform, Fubon Bank seeks to streamline the entire tokenization process and expedite property transactions.</p>

By incorporating CBDCs in the real estate market, the bank aims to eliminate traditional barriers to property investments and offer increased accessibility to potential buyers and investors.</p>



<p>During the third quarter testing phase, Fubon Bank plans to tokenize select properties from its portfolio, making them available for investment through digital Hong Kong dollars. Interested parties can acquire fractional ownership in these properties, allowing them to participate in the real estate market with smaller investment amounts.</p>

<p>One of the key advantages of the Ripple CBDC platform is its ability to provide instant settlement for transactions.

This improvement in efficiency will not only benefit customers but also enhance the bank&#8217;s overall operational performance.</p>

<p>Worldcoin published a security audit report on its official blog that starting April 2023, audit firms Nethermind and Least Authority conducted two independent security audits of the protocol.</p>

<p>Among them, Nethermind focused on examining the smart contract of the agreement and found a total of 26 issues. Of these, 92.6% were fixed after the verification phase, one bug was mitigated, and the other was confirmed.</p>



<p>The Least Authority focused on examining the cryptographic usage of the protocol, found three problems, and made six recommendations. All issues are &#8220;solved or planned to be solved.&#8221;</p>

<p>Worldcoin first surfaced in 2021 when it announced that it would give away free tokens to any user who verified their humanity, which they could do by scanning their irises with a device named &#8220;The Globe&#8221;. The project was co-founded by Sam Altman, the co-founder of AI developer OpenAI. The project started going public on July 25 after nearly two years of development and beta testing.</p>



<p>The crypto community was split when the project launched, with some participants seeing it as the beginning of a dystopian future where privacy would be eliminated. On the contrary, others see it as a necessary step to protect humans from malicious AIs.</p>



<p>Previously, the French and UK watchdogs had also warned that they would scrutinize the protocol with concerns about potential privacy risks associated with data collection and storage of sensitive biometrics.</p>

<p>The initiative is led by Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) and Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), and supported by Senators Joe Manchin (<a href="http://d-w.va/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">D-W.Va</a>.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). Their proposal, the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act, aims to enforce stricter regulation of digital assets to fortify national security and align the crypto ecosystem with the existing frameworks that oversee the broader financial system.</p>

To eliminate these illicit activities, the proposed measures would extend the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) responsibilities, including the Know-Your-Customer requirements, to various digital asset network participants, such as wallet providers, miners, and validators. Additionally, the bill plans to strengthen the enforcement of BSA compliance and mitigate the illicit finance risks of digital asset ATMs.</p>

<p>According to reports, in 2022, illicit digital asset transactions reached an all-time high of $20 billion. This alarming statistic highlights the need for more stringent regulations around cryptocurrencies. Interestingly, the bill has garnered support from unlikely sources in the banking world, such as the Bank Policy Institute and the Massachusetts Bankers Association. Senator Warren, a known critic of Wall Street and the crypto industry, has found common ground with these former adversaries on this issue &#8211; a mutual desire to steer cryptocurrencies into safer harbors.</p>

<p>The Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act is a critical step towards combating the misuse of digital assets and ensuring greater security for the nation. The proposed measures will bring digital assets in line with existing financial regulations, thereby reducing the risks of illicit activities while also promoting safer and more transparent practices in the crypto industry.</p>

<li><em>Attorneys representing the US Department of Justice (DOJ) want the court to recover the bail and remand Sam Bankman-Fried before the October trial.</em></li>



<li><em>In the letter, Friday stated that Bankman-Fried had a history of witness tampering.</em></li>

<p>Attorneys representing the US Department of Justice are formally seeking a &#8220;retention order&#8221; against former FTX Sam Bankman-Fried, according to a new court letter.</p>



<p>In federal court on Wednesday, prosecutor Danielle Sassoon said there were &#8220;no conditions of release that would guarantee public safety,&#8221; a week after the US Justice Department charged Bankman-Fried with leaking the private diary of former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison to the media.</p>



<p>The letter on Friday claimed that Bankman-Fried had a history of witness tampering. Specifically, the government said Bankman-Fried contacted Witness-1, &#8220;the current General Counsel of FTX US, who may be a witness at the trial&#8221; through the Signal messaging app.</p>

<p>The government does that Bankman-Fried has the &#8220;right to speak and defend himself to the press, even on hundreds of occasions as [is] the case here&#8221; but that Bankman-Fried has &#8220;repeatedly&#8221; sought to &#8220;corruptly influence witnesses and interfere with a fair trial through attempted public harassment and shaming.&#8221;</p>



<p>As a result, the letter continued, Bankman-Fried&#8217;s inability to comply with any condition or combination of release and bail conditions proved &#8220;insufficient.&#8221;</p>



<p>On November 11, 2022, FTX declared bankruptcy after reports of financial vulnerabilities were published. Before its collapse, FTX was valued at $32 billion and had more than a million users. Sam Bankman-Fried currently faces eight counts, mostly related to fraud and financial conspiracies, with a maximum sentence of life in prison. But so far, he has denied all related allegations.</p>

<p>According to a July 28 report from The Wall Street Journal, BaFin advised Binance that CZ may not have passed a &#8220;fit and proper&#8221; test under the financial watchdog&#8217;s regulatory guidelines. According to the regulator&#8217;s requirements for a license application, managing directors CZ must have the necessary professional credentials, be in good standing, and commit enough time to carry out their duties in order to manage an institution.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Binance <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/german-regulator-raised-concerns-binance-ceo-license-application" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told </a>Cointelegraph that The Wall Street Journal&#8217;s story was incorrect and said the exchange had actively pulled back and cooperated with regulators. The exchange should have given specific feedback on CZ-related details at the time of publication.</p>

<p>The world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange announced on July 26 that it had withdrawn its application in Germany, saying at the time that the decision was based in part on centralizing the company&#8217;s efforts into compliance with the European Union&#8217;s Crypto Asset Market (MiCA) framework.</p>



<p>The move comes after pulling out of markets including Austria, Belgium, and the Netherlands and when regulators sued its US arm for operating an unregistered exchange.</p>



<p>Currently, Binance and its CEO are facing legal actions brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for allegedly violating securities laws and corresponding transaction instructions.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In addition to the hype of Liquid Staking after the 2nd largest network Ethereum market successfully implemented the Shanghai upgrade, LSD and LST present unprecedented new opportunities in the DeFi market, something that every stakeholder of DeFi will need to understand to keep up. However, many people still need to understand these two concepts well and need to know which term is correct. So let&#8217;s find out in the article below.</strong></h5>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">The concept of LSD and LST appeared</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2155.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="740" height="492" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2155.png" alt="Is There A Difference Between LSD And LST Terms?

<p>If you hold a staking cryptocurrency (e.g., Ethereum, Tezos, Cosmos, Solana, Cardano or others), you can stake a portion of your holdings and earn rewards.</p>



<p>Your cryptocurrency earns you staking rewards because the blockchain makes it work. Cryptocurrency staking uses a &#8220;consensus mechanism&#8221; known as Proof of Stake, which allows them to ensure that all transactions are verified and secure without needing an intermediary bank or payment processor. If you lock it, your cryptocurrency is part of the process.</p>



<p>LSD and LST have emerged due to the growing popularity of the Liquid Staking market among crypto investors. This hype must make us reiterate the Ethereum network&#8217;s transition to Proof-Of-Stake on September 15, 2022, and at this point it is still not possible to cancel the already staked ETH staking. This is a pretty big deal, as some bettors have been waiting since December 2020 to start claiming their rewards. However, this issue was resolved with the Shanghai Upgrade, which took place on April 12, 2023. The Shanghai Upgrade <a href="https://coincu.com/181294-ethereum-shanghai-upgrade-liquid-staking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">allows</a> validators to cancel their ETH staking at any time, providing family of higher liquidity options.</p>



<p>This creates a dilemma for ETH validators. By keeping their ETH staked, they lost the opportunity to use it for other profitable activities, however, by canceling the staking, they lose the passive income they received from transaction fees. In an ideal world, they would be able to keep their ETH staking, while still having the liquidity to deploy it in additional revenue-generating DeFi operations.</p>

<p>You may have noticed that two competing terms are being thrown around: Liquidity Staking Derivatives (LSD) and Liquidity Staking Tokens (LST). It refers to encrypted representations of staking assets in the blockchain network, providing flexibility and liquidity while earning staking rewards. LST can be traded or used in DeFi protocols.</p>



<p>Liquid Staking Tokens (LST) could be tokens issued on another layer or chain (e.g., an Ethereum token representing staked assets on a different Proof-of-Stake blockchain). These LSTs would be traded on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). They can be used as collateral or participate in other DeFi (Decentralized Finance) applications, offering more flexibility to token holders while their original staked tokens continue to earn staking rewards.</p>



<p>Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSD) might refer to financial instruments or derivatives products built on top of Liquid Staking solutions. These derivatives would be linked to the underlying staked assets and their associated rewards. By using derivatives, investors can gain exposure to the staking benefits without directly participating in staking themselves.</p>



<p>Many long-term crypto holders see staking as a way to put their assets to work by generating rewards rather than letting crypto wallets collect dust. Staking also contributes to the security and efficiency of the blockchain projects you support. Blocking some of your funds makes the blockchain more resistant to attacks and enhances its transaction processing capabilities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Is there a difference between LSD and LST?</h2>



<p>LSD is the most widely used term today, so we included it in this introductory article, but everyone agrees that the word is not technically correct.</p>



<p>The idea of LSD as derivatives has helped many users understand the concept by being similar to traditional financial derivatives. One could speculate that the familiarity of the acronym due to a well-known hallucinogen also contributed to the enduring strength of the moniker.</p>



<p>In practice, however, the analogy with derivatives is not entirely accurate, and the Proof Of Stake Alliance <a href="https://www.proofofstakealliance.org/22123-posa-liquid-staking-legal-white-paper" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has called</a> for a switch to using the more technically correct term &#8220;Liquid Staking Tokens&#8221; (LST) instead of LSD.</p>



<p>One of the main goals of this change is to have greater adoption of liquid staking technology and blockchain innovation. The name of the liquid staking receipt token should accurately reflect its underlying asset &#8211; it is incorrect to name a liquid staking token an LSD or liquid staking derivative.</p>

<p>LSTs act as a blockchain-based record verifying that the holder has staked the corresponding token, owns that token, and can present the record to unstake it whenever required. With the lack of regulatory and tax clarity surrounding liquid staking tokens, it is important to avoid using phrases like LSD and instead use accurate and clear terminology to describe the nature of activities.</p>



<p>The Proof of Stake Alliance (POSA) published two landmark white papers in February 2023, providing the first legal research and analysis that identifies and examines key questions around regulation and taxation for liquidity staking in the United States.</p>



<p>The articles, created by the first working group to bring together policy and legal experts, business leaders, and competitors to address key liquidity staking issues, were published and released together with LST-related industry best practice guidelines.</p>



<p>Research by the working group of legal, policy, and industry experts reason that:</p>



<ul>
<li>Liquid staking receipt tokens (LSTs) for digital commodities should not be considered investment contracts or notes, and, therefore, should not be treated as securities under the U.S. federal securities laws;</li>



<li>LSTs should not be considered swaps under U.S. federal commodity law;</li>



<li>The conversion&nbsp;of cryptoassets&nbsp;for receipt tokens should not be considered a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes;</li>



<li>It is important to name tokens appropriately based on the reality of the nature of the relationship between the underlying token and the receipt token. The group recommends accurately and appropriately describing liquid staking receipts as “Liquid Staking Tokens”or “LSTs” instead of the inaccurate but commonly used term “Liquid Staking Derivatives” or “LSDs.”</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>In short, LSD or LST are both terms that unlock the staked tokens held by stakers and allow them to be traded and used as collateral in DeFi protocols. The terms LST and LSD have the same meaning and can be used interchangeably. However, regulatory uncertainty encourages the community to use the word LST.</p>



<p>2023 will see LSD/LST go from hype to the foundation of the new DeFi economy. To achieve this, new options must emerge to unlock only revenue-generation opportunities that LSD/LST offers.</p>



<p>LSD/LST offers one of the most exciting new opportunities for DeFi investors right now, offering the opportunity to receive passive income from staking ETH while also putting it to work in operations and other profit through LSD/LST.</p>



<p>The key to increasing the TVL of staking ETH lies in expanding the utility of LSD/LST. While the liquidity provided by LSD/LST, in principle, offers limitless potential, the options available to put them to work in profitable operations are still limited at the moment.</p>
