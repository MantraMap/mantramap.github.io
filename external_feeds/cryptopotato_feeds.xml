            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The brand-new staking cryptocurrency BTC20 ($BTC20) has generated significant buzz in the past week, raising over $1.7 million through its presale phase.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.care/b__34851?referrer=new-stake-to-earn-token-btc20-raises-1-7m-in-a-week-heres-why-traders-are-backing-it" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">BTC20 ($BTC20)&#8217;s</a> presale has been an instant hit because it allows investors to buy tokens at the symbolic price of $1 – an homage to the original Bitcoin&#8217;s early days.</p>
<p>With the momentum around the project showing no signs of slowing, many in the crypto community are backing it to pump once it makes its open market debut in the coming weeks.</p>
<h2>$BTC20 Offers Lucrative Staking Rewards with Energy-Efficient Setup</h2>
<p>BTC20’s marquee feature is its staking model, which allows token holders to earn rewards over time through a vesting contract.</p>
<p>Inspired by the original Bitcoin’s block rewards, this contract is designed to distribute $BTC20 tokens to stakers over an estimated 120 years.</p>
<p>Per the BTC20 <a href="https://btc20.com/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">whitepaper</a>, all unsold tokens (minimum of 14.95 million $BTC20) will be locked into the staking contract once the presale ends.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-23.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-262500" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-23.jpg" alt="Picture1" width="602" height="256" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-23.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-23-300x128.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-23-50x21.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Token holders can then stake their $BTC20 to receive recurring rewards – with the more $BTC20 staked, the higher the payout.</p>
<p>Naturally, this staking model provides a way for investors to earn passive income by holding $BTC20 long term.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as this model utilizes a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism instead of Bitcoin&#8217;s Proof-of-Work (PoW), BTC20 aspires to provide a more energy-efficient and sustainable alternative to Bitcoin&#8217;s mining setup.</p>
<p>As noted in an article from <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/cryptocurrency-goes-green-proof-stake-offer-solution-energy-concerns-rcna1030" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">NBC</a>, experts believe that PoS protocols can consume up to 99.99% less energy than PoW protocols – essentially making BTC20 a “green crypto” project.</p>
<h2>Homage to the Original Bitcoin Helps Build $BTC20 Presale Hype</h2>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.care/b__34851?referrer=new-stake-to-earn-token-btc20-raises-1-7m-in-a-week-heres-why-traders-are-backing-it" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">BTC20’s</a> stake-to-earn setup has played into its presale hype, which is also bolstered by the project’s strategy of paying homage to Bitcoin’s history.</p>
<p>Just as Bitcoin’s price was $1 in its early days, BTC20 aims to replicate that opportunity by allowing presale investors to acquire tokens at the same price point.</p>
<p>Many in the rapidly-growing BTC20 <a href="https://t.me/BTC20Token" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Telegram community</a> believe this could prove fruitful, given the project’s potential for post-listing growth.</p>
<p>Moreover, BTC20 mirrors Bitcoin’s original circulating supply of 21 million tokens.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-33.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-262499" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-33.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="299" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-33.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-33-300x149.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-33-50x25.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Up to 6.05 million of these tokens will be sold in the presale, split into two distinct stages.</p>
<p>This carefully designed tokenomics setup aims to recreate Bitcoin&#8217;s roots while benefiting from the perks associated with being built on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>Leveraging the Ethereum blockchain offers numerous benefits as it creates opportunities for $BTC20 to be integrated with an array of decentralized applications (dApps).</p>
<p>Given that Ethereum is a hub for NFT, DeFi, and metaverse activity, structuring $BTC20 as an ERC-20 token allows for immense interoperability and future utility – a factor that’s contributing to the growing presale hype.</p>
<h2>Crypto Influencers Back BTC20 to Be the Next Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Capitalizing on the momentum from its presale success and unique staking configuration, BTC20 has quickly gained popularity on social media.</p>
<p>The project’s <a href="https://twitter.com/BTC20Token" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> page has swelled to over 1,700 followers at the time of writing, with new people flooding in each day.</p>
<p>Several notable crypto influencers have also been discussing BTC20’s potential.</p>
<p>Michael Wrubel, who boasts over 310,000 subscribers on YouTube, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDz78nbcYzY&amp;pp=ygUMYnRjMjAgY3J5cHRv" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">uploaded</a> a video describing $BTC20 as &#8220;the next Bitcoin.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-31.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-262498" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-31.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="179" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-31.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-31-300x89.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-31-50x15.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Additionally, prominent crypto analyst Jacob Bury also discussed BTC20 in a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R47JhiEr3M&amp;pp=ygUMYnRjMjAgY3J5cHRv" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">video</a>, speculating that it&#8217;s a &#8220;new crypto that could explode soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given this influencer backing, many BTC20 community members are already discussing how high $BTC20 may rise once it is listed on the open market after the presale concludes.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s impossible to predict, if the current hype and momentum persist, $BTC20 could experience considerable appreciation from the $1 presale price, making it a token to keep an eye on in the coming weeks.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[An additional $37 million stolen during the hack on Tron and Bitcoin has been identified, increasing the initial estimate of $23 million to $60 million.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The losses incurred by crypto payments processor Alphapo during its security breach are now estimated to be $60 million, roughly two days after hackers exploited the platform&#8217;s hot wallets.</p>
<p>According to an update <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1683747073227624448?s=20" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">provided</a> by on-chain sleuth ZachXBT, an additional $37 million compromised during the hack on Tron and Bitcoin has been located, increasing the initial estimate of $23 million to $60 million.</p>
<h2>Alphapo&#8217;s Hack Estimated to $60M</h2>
<p>Alphapo is a payments processor for crypto-related gambling platforms such as HypeDrop, Bovada, and Ignition. The platform&#8217;s hot wallets were <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1682941291825627137?s=20" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">drained</a> on July 23, with the attackers stealing over $23 million. The hackers managed to gain control of users&#8217; crypto assets on several blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tron.</p>
<p>Blockchain security firm PeckShield <a href="https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1683034275489382401?s=20" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">disclosed</a> that the assets stolen were approximately 6 million USDT, 108,000 USDC, 2,500 ETH, 1,700 DAI, 100 million FTN, 430,000 TFL, and an undetermined amount of BTC. The hackers swapped the stablecoins and other tokens for over 5,730 ETH before bridging them to Avalanche and Bitcoin.</p>
<p>ZachXBT said the hack appeared to have been perpetrated by the infamous North Korea-linked hacker group Lazarus due to their &#8220;very distinct&#8221; on-chain fingerprint. Lazarus Group is <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/north-korea-responsible-for-ronin-network-hack-fbi-confirms/" data-wpel-link="internal">believed</a> to be behind crypto&#8217;s largest hack involving the Ronin Network, with a loss of $620 million. Reports disclosed that the hacker group <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/north-korean-hackers-stole-1-7b-worth-crypto-in-2022-chainalysis/" data-wpel-link="internal">stole</a> roughly $1.7 billion in crypto throughout 2022.</p>
<h2>Alphapo Unsure of Withdrawal Resumption Time</h2>
<p>While Alphapo attempted to contain the incident on Sunday, the HypeDrop team halted the platform&#8217;s withdrawal service and <a href="https://twitter.com/HypeDrop/status/1682832668201721856?s=20" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">informed</a> users that their provider was working to resolve some issues on their side.</p>
<p>Alphapo is yet to release an official statement updating users on the matter. However, HypeDrop said it is monitoring the situation and would ensure the funds of users whose payments were affected are safe.</p>
<p>In a recent tweet, the HypeDrop team <a href="https://twitter.com/HypeDrop/status/1683818126608158720?s=20" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">said</a> they had disabled crypto deposits for the time being because Alphapo is still manually processing withdrawals slowly. However, they have procured the services of another provider, as Alphapo is not sure when withdrawals will be automated again.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our provider has advised us that withdrawals will be automated again, but unfortunately with no ETA. Therefore, we&#8217;ve implemented another payment service provider today as a backup option. We want to remind you that withdrawals will get paid out, either by our current provider or new provider,&#8221; HypeDrop said.</p></blockquote>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PRESS RELEASE &#8211; Las Vegas, Nevada, July 25th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://xandeum.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Xandeum</a>, a trailblazing blockchain startup committed to accelerating humanity&#8217;s transition to decentralized control, announces its highly anticipated launch on July 30, 2023, at 11:00 am PT.</p>
<p>Leveraging the power of blockchain technology, Xandeum&#8217;s mission is to empower collective self-determination by creating a scalable, blockchain-based storage layer for smart contracts, which adds a new dimension to the decentralized web. Named External Global Grouped Storage (EGGS), this solution pioneers a new era of storage-enabled Web3 apps (sedApps) on Xandeum.</p>
<p>In a departure from the traditional model of seeking venture capital, Xandeum prioritizes community control by selling node licenses directly to its users. The grand launch will introduce an incentivized purchase model, creating a buzz for this revolutionary blockchain project.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Xandeum is all about transforming the world of blockchain,&#8221; said Bernie Blume, founder of Xandeum. &#8220;We&#8217;re not just creating another blockchain; we&#8217;re creating a holistic platform that integrates advanced blockchain technology with a revolutionary storage solution, paving the way for fully-fledged, storage-enabled Web3 apps.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The grand launch introduces an attractive purchase model: the first transaction to purchase a node will receive a generous 50% rebate, the second 49%, the third 48%, and so on until the 50th transaction, which will still secure a 1% rebate.</p>
<p>This follows Xandeum&#8217;s track record of success, already having sold over 2,809 nodes for proceeds surpassing $1.9 million under the prior brand name Bitoku. By opening the market to its community, Xandeum aims to foster further expansion and innovation.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Our community just loves to embark on this journey so early, at least 4 to 5 months ahead of the ICO, in order to reap the maximum benefits.” notes Blume.</p></blockquote>
<p>Post-launch, Xandeum will roll out an incentivized Devnet on August 15, followed by a Testnet in the fall, an ICO of the XAND token in November and a beta version of the mainnet scheduled for 2024.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Join us in this exciting journey. Visit our website, explore the lightpaper and the RFC version of our technical whitepaper, check out the roadmap, and prepare to participate in our grand launch,&#8221; urged Blume.</p></blockquote>
<p>Users are invited to join the blockchain revolution at xandeum.com and prepare for the Grand Launch. <a href="https://xandeum.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Xandeum.com</a> is set to take blockchain technology to the next level.</p>

<p><strong>Key Support levels: $0.073</strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Resistance levels: $0.085</strong></p>
<h2>1. The Elon Musk Effect</h2>
<p>The price immediately took to the upside when the market saw that the richest man in the world was promoting DOGE in his bio. Moreover, Elon <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/elon-musk-rebrands-twitter-to-x-this-cryptocurrency-soars-1400-in-return/" data-wpel-link="internal">plans</a> to turn Twitter or X into one of the largest payment systems, which might also include cryptocurrencies. With that in mind, DOGE is one of the prime candidates for such a roll-out.</p>
<figure id="attachment_262344" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-262344" style="width: 1187px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/elon.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-262344" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/elon.jpg" alt="Elon Effect" width="1187" height="631" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/elon.jpg 1187w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/elon-300x159.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/elon-1024x544.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/elon-768x408.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/elon-50x27.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1187px) 100vw, 1187px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-262344" class="wp-caption-text">The Elon Effect</figcaption></figure>
<h2>2. Momentum Turns Bullish</h2>
<p>While most of the market is in red or trying to find support, DOGE entered a sustained uptrend. In the process, it turned the key resistance at $0.073 into support, and now the next target for this cryptocurrency will be found at $0.085.</p>
<figure id="attachment_262346" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-262346" style="width: 1825px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DOGEUSDT_2023-07-25_10-15-49.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-262346" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DOGEUSDT_2023-07-25_10-15-49.png" alt="DOGEUSDT_2023-07-25_10-15-49" width="1825" height="902" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DOGEUSDT_2023-07-25_10-15-49.png 1825w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DOGEUSDT_2023-07-25_10-15-49-300x148.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DOGEUSDT_2023-07-25_10-15-49-1024x506.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DOGEUSDT_2023-07-25_10-15-49-768x380.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DOGEUSDT_2023-07-25_10-15-49-1536x759.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DOGEUSDT_2023-07-25_10-15-49-50x25.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1825px) 100vw, 1825px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-262346" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>3. Sustained Buy Volume</h2>
<p>The anticipation of Twitter&#8217;s rebranding has led to many speculators taking a position in DOGE in the past two weeks. Buyers dominated the chart in July, and these levels of buy pressure were last seen back in April when DOGE made a local high at 10 cents.</p>
<figure id="attachment_262345" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-262345" style="width: 1825px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DOGEUSDT_2023-07-25_10-28-42.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-262345" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DOGEUSDT_2023-07-25_10-28-42.png" alt="DOGEUSDT_2023-07-25_10-28-42" width="1825" height="902" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DOGEUSDT_2023-07-25_10-28-42.png 1825w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DOGEUSDT_2023-07-25_10-28-42-300x148.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DOGEUSDT_2023-07-25_10-28-42-1024x506.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DOGEUSDT_2023-07-25_10-28-42-768x380.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DOGEUSDT_2023-07-25_10-28-42-1536x759.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DOGEUSDT_2023-07-25_10-28-42-50x25.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1825px) 100vw, 1825px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-262345" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Bias</h2>
<p>The bias for DOGE is bullish.</p>
<h2>Short-Term Prediction for ADA Price</h2>
<p>With momentum picking up, DOGE might be able to reach its current target at $0.085. If that resistance will break as well, the road to 10 cents becomes clearer.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The recent correction of the cryptocurrency market seems to have caused panic among major investors, with some selling a chunk of their holdings.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Dumping Ethereum (ETH) appears to be the main trend, whereas some whales have also ditched their Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) possessions.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Decline&#8217;s Outcome</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1683677550567112704" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">revealed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> by Lookonchain, several cryptocurrency whales have recently dumped their stash &#8220;in panic&#8221; amid the recent correction of the digital asset market.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One Ethereum investor sold nearly 4,000 ETH for over $7.3 million when the token&#8217;s price stood at $1,846. Another dumped 7,115 ETH for $13.12 million. Currently, the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization trades slightly higher at over $1,855 (per CoinGecko&#8217;s data).</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Shortly after, an investor </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1683684848844832768" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">dumped</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> 16,751 ETH for almost $31 million. They then deposited the amount to the crypto exchange Binance and withdrew $30.8 million in USDT. The stash was later distributed to Aave and Compound through two addresses. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The sell-off did not include only Ethereum. Whale &#8220;0x700b&#8221; parted with 150 WBTC at a selling price of $29,053, meaning the transaction was worth $4.36 million.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While some argued that this was a wise move considering the market correction, others disagreed.

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The renewed enthusiasm surrounding the asst seems to be fueled by Ripple&#8217;s triumph in the legal battle against the United Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PRESS RELEASE &#8211; Singapore, Singapore, July 25th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://labsgroup.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">LABS Group</a>, the frontrunner in blockchain-based real estate investment, is delighted to announce the successful distribution of dividends to early investors of the Kunang Kunang Tent Resort project based in Indonesia. This significant accomplishment underpins LABS Group&#8217;s commitment to rewarding its community members and cementing trust in the burgeoning world of decentralized real estate investing.</p>
<p>The Kunang Kunang Tent Resort, nestled in a coveted location famed for its natural beauty, has become a point of interest for avant-garde investors seeking unique real estate market opportunities. By adopting a novel approach and employing blockchain technology, LABS Group has transformed the way people invest in real estate, offering fractional ownership through tokenization.</p>
<p>Early investors of the Kunang Kunang Tent Resort have been vital to supporting this revolutionary project from its genesis. In recognition of their contributions and to share in the success of the project, LABS Group is thrilled to distribute dividends to these esteemed community members. Despite the delay in the resort&#8217;s completion due to COVID restrictions, it was successfully finalized in April 2022 and has since earned recognition in East Java.</p>
<p>Gravity Resorts, the hotel management team, remained undeterred despite temporary flight suspensions from Bali to Banyuwangi due to reduced travel volume. They have achieved impressive ratings across major platforms like <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/id/kunang-kunang-tent-resort.ms.html?label=Share-joF9O0%401688643925&amp;auth_success=1&amp;aid=356980" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Booking.com</a> (9.6), <a href="https://www.agoda.com/kunang-kunang-tent-resort/hotel/banyuwangi-id.html?cid=1844104" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Agoda</a> (9.3), and <a href="https://www.google.com.my/travel/hotels/entity/ChoI_YHAtvPJs7ydARoNL2cvMTFwejN4NTZqYhAB?utm_campaign=sharing&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_source=htls&amp;ved=0CAAQ5JsGahcKEwiQ_rj774OAAxUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAw&amp;ts=CAESABoECgIaACoECgAaAA" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Google Review</a> (4.8/5). The resort managed an average occupancy rate of 68% in its first year and distributed dividends amounting to an approximate yield of 10%, demonstrating profitability despite a slow start.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our early investors have been instrumental in turning the vision of the Kunang Kunang Tent Resort into a reality,&#8221; said Bernard Lau, CEO of LABS Group. &#8220;We&#8217;re excited to reciprocate their trust and faith in our platform by distributing dividends that demonstrate the financial potential of blockchain-based real estate investments.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>LABS Group ardently believes in the potency of decentralized finance to open new investment avenues for individuals worldwide. By harnessing blockchain technology, the platform presents a secure and transparent investment ecosystem, enabling individuals to partake in real estate projects once limited to a select few.</p>
<p>This achievement not only commemorates the dividend distribution but also accentuates the trust and credibility that LABS Group has cultivated within the community. As the real estate market continues to evolve, LABS Group remains at the cutting edge, pioneering the confluence of blockchain and real estate to conceive innovative investment opportunities and catalyze positive transformations.</p>
<p>As a token of appreciation and a way of giving back to its community, LABS Group is launching the Owner’s Circle NFT collection, which can be purchased with the LABS native token to gain the ability to receive rewards from profits generated from resort operations managed by LABS Group. The majority of net profits generated from property operations will be distributed equally amongst the Owner’s Circle members with the BNB token.</p>
<p>The proceeds received from the sale of the Owner’s Circle collection will be used to set up the Owner’s Fund, which will be used to invest in Real Estate related businesses to increase the pool of rewards which will be distributed on a monthly or annual basis depending on the type of property. With Kunang-Kunang as the pilot project, the purchasers will be seeing immediate value with proof of performance and an ever-growing portfolio of Real Estate projects which will be parked under the Owner’s Circle collection.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ripple&#8217;s XRP has been making headlines for many months now, with the excitement mostly circling around the case against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>Earlier in July, Judge Analisa Torres <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.551082/gov.uscourts.nysd.551082.874.0.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">ruled</a> that secondary sales of XRP do not constitute investment contracts. The news was widely perceived as positive, and the markets reacted immediately, with the cryptocurrency almost doubling in price.</p>
<p>And while the Commission has more or less confirmed that there will be an appeal, this doesn&#8217;t seem to discourage traders, especially now that many exchanges relisted XRP.</p>
<h2>XRP Becomes 2023&#8217;s Most Traded Altcoin</h2>
<p>Data from the analytics resource Kaiko <a href="https://twitter.com/KaikoData/status/1683513794536906752" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">revealed</a> that XRP has taken the spot of the most-traded altcoin in 2023 so far.</p>
<figure id="attachment_262342" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-262342" style="width: 1306px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/xrp_chart_kaiko.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-262342" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/xrp_chart_kaiko.jpg" alt="xrp_chart_kaiko" width="1306" height="708" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/xrp_chart_kaiko.jpg 1306w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/xrp_chart_kaiko-300x163.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/xrp_chart_kaiko-1024x555.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/xrp_chart_kaiko-768x416.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/xrp_chart_kaiko-50x27.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1306px) 100vw, 1306px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-262342" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Kaiko via Twitter</figcaption></figure>
<p>Trailing behind it, albeit by a lot, are SOL, the popular meme coin DOGE, BNB, MATIC, and others. It&#8217;s highly likely that the surge in trading volume has resulted directly from Ripple&#8217;s partial win against the SEC following the most recent court ruling.</p>
<p>Many leading cryptocurrency exchanges <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/the-exchanges-that-delisted-xrp-following-the-ripple-sec-lawsuit/" data-wpel-link="internal">delisted</a> XRP back in 2020 when the Commission filed its lawsuit, essentially alleging that the altcoin fits the criteria of security. Once the court ruling was out, though, and it found that secondary sales of XRP didn&#8217;t constitute an investment contract, most of these re-listed the altcoin, prompting a <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-xrp-breaks-another-2023-record-today-heres-what/" data-wpel-link="internal">massive surge</a> in trading volume and open interest.</p>
<p>The above was also clearly reflected in the comments of Max Sandy &#8211; Senior Product Manager at Ramp Network. When reached for his opinion last week, Sandy said:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s been a booming week for XRP. According to Ramp Network data, XRP&#8217;s worldwide volume surged by an astonishing 1113% compared to the previous 90-day average. The number of users buying XRP through Ramp increased by 834% worldwide, while new users joining the XRP party skyrocketed by a remarkable 1,215% demonstrating an increased interest from both the old and new guard.</p></blockquote>
<p>The PM also said that XRP became the #1 most-purchased cryptocurrency in the UK on their platform.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s Next for XRP? Nexo CEO Antoni Trenchev Chips In</h2>
<p><em>CryptoPotato </em>reached out to Antony Trenchev for his thoughts as well. According to him, XRP&#8217;s increase has had a ripple effect on the market, but he also acknowledged that if we zoom out, reaching its previous all-time highs won&#8217;t be as straightforward.</p>
<blockquote><p>If you look back over the past week, XRP has had a ripple effect on the market. Zooming out the battle for previous all time highs will not be a straight line. Further upward movement is conceivable if macro tailwinds work to crypto&#8217;s advantage coupled with a Bitcoin ETF approval. &#8211; Trenchev said.</p></blockquote>
<figure id="attachment_214536" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-214536" style="width: 389px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Trenchev.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class=" wp-image-214536" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Trenchev.jpg" alt="Trenchev" width="389" height="259" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Trenchev.jpg 1200w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Trenchev-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Trenchev-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Trenchev-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Trenchev-50x33.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-214536" class="wp-caption-text">Antoni Trenchev, CEO at Nexo</figcaption></figure>
<p>Indeed, many have pointed out BlackRock&#8217;s success rate in getting their ETF filings approved. It&#8217;s 575 to 1. That&#8217;s right, the asset management behemoth has only had one of its filings rejected.</p>
<p>Trenchev also noted that XRP has a devoted following in the East, while the recent court ruling has also had an effect on other cryptocurrencies as well.</p>
<blockquote><p>In the East, particularly Korea, XRP has a devoted following. In the west, meanwhile, the court ruling has been taken as a sign that the SEC’s most punitive enforcers have been reined in. Combined, these events have had a powerful effect not only on XRP, but on other cryptos. If this is the start of crypto’s alt season, it would be fitting that XRP would be the coin to lead the breakout.</p></blockquote>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s been another wild ride in the meme coin market this week, with several ups and downs catching investors’ attention.</p>
<p>Dogecoin led the gains, surging 15% amid renewed interest, while the highly-anticipated Evil Pepe Coin presale hit the $730,000 mark.</p>
<p>On a less positive note, $PEPE witnessed an ongoing price decline, leading to rising investor skepticism about the token’s long-term potential.</p>
<h2>Dogecoin Price Continues Rebound &amp; Soars 15%</h2>
<p>Meme coin legend Dogecoin ($DOGE) saw a double-digit price increase in the past week, surging 15% to hit the $0.077 level.</p>
<p>This continued Dogecoin&#8217;s steady uptrend from the lows of mid-June when the token was valued at just $0.058.</p>
<p>The price uptick seems to be driven by renewed interest and hype within the $DOGE community on social media.</p>
<p>For instance, the r/Dogecoin <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">subreddit</a> has been flooded with speculation due to the recent bullish price trend.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-32.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-262394" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-32.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="288" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-32.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-32-300x144.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-32-50x24.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Dogecoin’s price boost puts it back at number seven in <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CoinMarketCap’s</a> list of the world’s biggest cryptocurrencies, with the coin now boasting a market cap of $10.8 billion.</p>
<p>Moreover, with Dogecoin’s current momentum, some in the crypto community think the coin can continue even higher – potentially hitting the resistance level around $0.083.</p>
<p>With the hype building around $DOGE again, it&#8217;s undoubtedly a coin to watch this week.</p>
<h2>Evil Pepe Coin Raises $730,000 with Only 8 Days Remaining on Presale</h2>
<p>Another meme coin worth watching is the presale sensation <a href="https://cryptopotato.care/b_evilpepe_35234?referrer=5-meme-coin-stories-to-watch-this-week-dogecoin-surges-15-following-twitter-rebrand-pepe-coin-price-slides-but-evil-pepe-coin-raises-730000" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Evil Pepe Coin ($EVILPEPE)</a>.</p>
<p>$EVILPEPE is one of the most hyped new meme coins on the market and has now raised a whopping $730,000 in its ongoing presale phase.</p>
<p>Although the presale was only launched a week ago, it has already attracted tremendous interest, with traders from around the world eager to participate.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-30.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-262393" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-30.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="235" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-30.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-30-300x117.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-30-50x20.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>However, with only eight days remaining in Evil Pepe Coin’s presale, prospective investors must move quickly to purchase $EVILPEPE tokens at the discounted price of $0.000333.</p>
<p>This low entry point could prove fruitful, given that $EVILPEPE benefits from its indirect association with the original $PEPE coin, which kickstarted the meme coin frenzy in April.</p>
<p>Moreover, the success of recent “2.0 coins”, essentially copycats of other high-profile tokens, has added credibility to Evil Pepe Coin’s strategy.</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://cryptopotato.care/b_evilpepe_35234?referrer=5-meme-coin-stories-to-watch-this-week-dogecoin-surges-15-following-twitter-rebrand-pepe-coin-price-slides-but-evil-pepe-coin-raises-730000" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">presale</a> nearing its end, investors have one final chance to get on board this high-potential meme coin on the ground floor.</p>
<h2>$PEPE’s Bearish Momentum Shows No Signs of Stopping</h2>
<p>While Evil Pepe Coin is showing bullish momentum, the original Pepe ($PEPE) is continuing its bearish trend, with price down 17% over the past week.</p>
<p>$PEPE is now trading around the $0.0000013 level – the same as in mid-June.</p>
<p>Most of the gains made throughout the last week of June and early July have now been erased, leaving $PEPE holders discouraged.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-24.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-262391" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-24.jpg" alt="Picture4" width="602" height="287" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-24.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-24-300x143.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-24-50x24.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>This extended slump suggests the hype and momentum around $PEPE may be drying up.</p>
<p>The meme coin shot up by over 10,000% when it hit the market in April but has struggled to maintain its value since then.</p>
<p>One of the main issues plaguing $PEPE is its lack of long-term utility, presenting a challenge for crypto investors to justify holding it.</p>
<p>However, with <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pepe" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CoinGecko</a> data showing that the 24-hour $PEPE trading volume exceeded $109 million, there may still be some interest in the coin – offering a silver lining to bulls.</p>
<h2>Trending Token Wall Street Memes Enters Final Stages of Presale with $17.5m Raised</h2>
<p><a href="https://bs_54c27399.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=5-meme-coin-stories-to-watch-this-week-dogecoin-surges-15-following-twitter-rebrand-pepe-coin-price-slides-but-evil-pepe-coin-raises-730000" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Memes ($WSM)</a> has been one of the breakout stars in the meme coin space this year, with the project’s presale having raised an incredible $17.5 million – and counting.</p>
<p>As its name implies, Wall Street Memes draws inspiration from the WallStreetBets subreddit, which changed meme culture forever.</p>
<p>However, Wall Street Memes has its own online community of 1.1 million &#8220;degens&#8221; spread across platforms like <a href="https://twitter.com/wallstmemes" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wallstbets/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture5-8.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-262390" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture5-8.jpg" alt="Picture5" width="602" height="300" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture5-8.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture5-8-300x150.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture5-8-50x25.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>The power that this community wields is evidenced by Wall Street Memes’ huge presale raise, with $WSM now gearing up for exchange listings in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>This early momentum hints that Wall Street Memes could have enormous price potential once it makes its open market debut.</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://bs_54c27399.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=5-meme-coin-stories-to-watch-this-week-dogecoin-surges-15-following-twitter-rebrand-pepe-coin-price-slides-but-evil-pepe-coin-raises-730000" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">presale</a> now in Stage 25 out of 30, prospective investors only have a narrow window to buy $WSM at the price of $0.0322.</p>
<h2>AI-X Coin Sees Huge Spike in Trading Volume</h2>
<p>Lastly, the newly-launched meme coin <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ai-x/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AI-X ($X)</a> is a trending project capitalizing on the excitement around artificial intelligence and Elon Musk.</p>
<p>This ERC-20 token brands itself as “Musk’s favorite” and aims to fund advancements in AI technology.</p>
<p>Boasting no transaction fees and a burned liquidity pool, $X offers deflationary tokenomics designed to help foster sustained price growth.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture6-5.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-262389" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture6-5.jpg" alt="Picture6" width="602" height="336" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture6-5.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture6-5-300x167.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture6-5-50x28.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Adding to the token&#8217;s hype is that Elon Musk has just decided to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/twitter-musk-logo-idTRNIKBN2Z40CP" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">rebrand</a> Twitter as “X” – getting rid of the platform’s iconic blue logo.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, this has boosted the momentum around the AI-X token, given that it has the ticker symbol $X.</p>
<p>With price up 1,400% over the past day, the AI-X community is capitalizing on this stroke of fortune, making it a token worth watching closely in the coming days.</p>
