<p>INTERNET CITY, DUBAI, 16th January, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>LBank Exchange, the digital asset trading platform, will list Qitmeer Network (MEER) on January 16, 2023. For all users of LBank Exchange, the MEER/USDT trading pair will be officially available for trading at 10:00 UTC on January 16, 2023.</p>
<p>As a high-performance public blockchain powered by the MeerDAG consensus, Qitmeer is creating a decentralized network and a better society where anyone can contribute. The listing of its native token on LBank Exchange will further expand its global reach and help it achieve its vision.</p>
<p>Qitmeer Network is a public blockchain that supports Islamic finance, with a secure and stable underlying network using BlockDAG &nbsp;(Directed Acyclic Graph of blocks) for data structure. It also features an efficient Layer2 eco-application layer with pluggable virtual machine system driven by MeerDAG consensus. This provides open infrastructure services for Islamic finance, ethical finance, and socially responsible investment, with a focus on delivering financial inclusion.</p>
<p>Qitmeer Network&rsquo;s consensus protocol SPECTRE is a fast-confirmation and high-throughput BlockDAG that guarantees high performance in a payment network. Additionally, Qitmeer utilizes another high-throughput BlockDAG protocol, GhostDAG, for linear transaction ordering. This circumvents SPECTRE&rsquo;s weak liveness and provides an ordering service for a fair reward system.</p>
<p>Simply put, with MeerDAG consensus, Qitmeer has the ability to process transactions quickly, achieving high TPS with low transaction costs. Developers can enjoy these benefits by creating dApps using the MeerEVM, which provides a better user experience than other blockchain VMs..</p>
<p>A decentralized and large-scale full-node network keeps Qitmeer Network highly resilient and secures its ecosystem. To explore Qitmeer, any user can become a Qitmeer miner, taking real control of the accounting and earning system rewards in BlockDAG collaboration mode. This will enable them to verify all blocks and transactions to ensure they comply with consensus rules, thus protecting ecosystem security. Having a complete Qitmeer ledger allows for faster querying and enables companies to parse specific data on a regular basis.</p>
<p>The listing of MEER on LBank Exchange marks another step towards Qitmeer&rsquo;s goal of creating an inclusive financial system that works for everyone.</p>
