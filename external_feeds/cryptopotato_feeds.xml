			            <description><![CDATA[The market is in search of direction following last week's explosive movements. Some coins, however, are defying the sentiment. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin Cash has been one of the best performers in the past week, expanding by a whopping 100%. The cryptocurrency keeps going strong with no real signs of slowing down.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin&#8217;s Price Looking for Direction</h2>
<p>Bitcoin broke above $30K with stellar momentum, which also took it above $31K before the weekend started.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the bulls were unable to maintain the buying pressure, which allowed sellers to step in and push the price back toward $30K. At the time of this writing, the primary cryptocurrency is trading at around $30,400.</p>
<figure id="attachment_257237" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-257237" style="width: 1183px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BTCUSDT_2023-06-27_11-44-02.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-257237" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BTCUSDT_2023-06-27_11-44-02.png" alt="BTCUSDT_2023-06-27_11-44-02" width="1183" height="491" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BTCUSDT_2023-06-27_11-44-02.png 1183w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BTCUSDT_2023-06-27_11-44-02-300x125.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BTCUSDT_2023-06-27_11-44-02-1024x425.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BTCUSDT_2023-06-27_11-44-02-768x319.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BTCUSDT_2023-06-27_11-44-02-50x21.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1183px) 100vw, 1183px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-257237" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>As it can be observed in the chart above, the price has entered a state of consolidation following the major surge above $31K and the subsequent correction. It&#8217;s also worth noting that these don&#8217;t tend to last very long and are usually followed by an explosive move in either direction. It appears BTC is currently looking for that direction.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Cash Continues to Outperform</h2>
<p>Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is downright the best performer for the past seven days, and it&#8217;s also one of the best performers for the last day. The cryptocurrency is up 107% for the week and 14% for the day, defying the stagnating sentiment of the past couple of days.</p>
<figure style="width: 1495px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cryptocurrency_heatmap_2706231.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-257238 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cryptocurrency_heatmap_2706231.jpg" alt="cryptocurrency_heatmap_2706231" width="1495" height="788" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cryptocurrency_heatmap_2706231.jpg 1495w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cryptocurrency_heatmap_2706231-300x158.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cryptocurrency_heatmap_2706231-1024x540.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cryptocurrency_heatmap_2706231-768x405.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cryptocurrency_heatmap_2706231-50x26.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1495px) 100vw, 1495px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Source: Quantify Crypto</figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As seen in the heatmap above, most of the coins are trading either slightly in the red or slightly in the green but with no clear breakout direction.Today&#8217;s best performer is FLEX Coin, up 15%. This also got it a spot in the top 100 cryptocurrencies by means of total market cap. Stacks (STX), on the other hand, has declined by some 7%, followed by Kaspa (KAS).</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Crypto and stock trading platform Robinhood is cutting staff as the firm struggles to maintain trading volumes and interest.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On June 26, Robinhood Markets said it was cutting about 7% or 150 of its full-time employees. The move comes as the firm struggles with reduced customer engagement. It stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We’re ensuring operational excellence in how we work together on an ongoing basis. In some cases, this may mean teams make changes based on volume, workload,”</p></blockquote>
<p>It is not the first time Robinhood has slashed staff, as a 23% cut was made in August 2022, and a total of 1,000 employees were laid off last year.</p>
<h2>Robinhood Interest Wanes</h2>
<p>The firm surged in popularity during the pandemic and lockdowns when a largely millennial customer base flocked to trade meme stocks and crypto. It boasted more than 21 million monthly active users during Q1 2021, its best-performing quarter.</p>
<p>However, by May 2023, that figure had halved to around 11 million monthly active users. Furthermore, revenue from transaction fees dropped 5% in Q1, 2023, year-on-year and was half of that in Q1, 2021</p>
<p>The latest batch of layoffs affected roles in customer experience, and platform shared services, customer trust and safety, and productivity, reported the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/robinhood-lays-off-about-7-of-its-full-time-employees-2111cb48" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">WSJ</a>.</p>
<p>This latest round of layoffs came less than a week after Robinhood agreed to acquire credit-card startup X1 in a cash deal worth $95 million.</p>
<p>The firm is seeking to diversify after <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/robinhood-delists-solana-sol-cardano-ada-polygon-matic-after-secs-claims/" data-wpel-link="internal">delisting</a> several digital assets this month in the wake of the regulatory attack on the industry.</p>
<p>According to Forbes, Robinhood is not the only large finance firm slashing staff this year.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is reportedly cutting 125 managing directors in its latest round of job cuts over the past 12 months. Additionally, big-four accounting firm KPMG laid out plans to slash 5% of its workforce, it <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianbushard/2023/06/26/2023-layoff-tracker-kpmg-robinhood-goldman-sachs-reportedly-cutting-hundreds/?sh=6fa99ae21822" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">reported</a>.</p>
<h2>US crypto and Tech Layoffs Continue</h2>
<p>According to Layoffs <a href="https://layoffs.fyi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Tracker</a>, payments platform Payoneer axed 10% of its workforce, or 200 people, this week. The firm, which went public in June 2021, has been facing headwinds in recent months due to the macroeconomic situation.</p>
<p>On June 14, Bitwise laid off all of its 900 employees and Binance.US has been letting staff go this month amid a <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/binance-lawyers-claim-gensler-offered-to-be-company-advisor/" data-wpel-link="internal">crackdown</a> from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>Additionally, crypto tax software startup Taxbit cut almost 40% of its staff earlier this month as the war on crypto continues to cripple American companies.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Bitcoin has rallied hard post BlackRock's ETF filing. However, there's an interesting trend that has been in the making over the last five years.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin started off the week on a solid note, above $30,000 after rapid gains. The market participants catalyzing this trend are taking their BTCs off centralized exchanges as investor confidence in this platform continued to diminish.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin held on exchange addresses has been in a perpetual decline following the COVID-19 crisis. as per Glassnode&#8217;s latest <a href="https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1673299646075084800" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">analysis</a>.</li>
<li>In fact, the figures have dwindled by 11.7% all the way to 2.27 million BTC, marking the lowest since December 21st, 2017.</li>
<li>Such a trend is typically perceived to be bullish for the underlying asset.</li>
<li>Further validating this trend is the declining &#8220;exchange whale ratio,&#8221; an indicator that measures the ratio between the sum of the top ten Bitcoin transactions to exchanges and the total exchange inflow.</li>
<li>CryptoQuant data <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/6498e24da6f3c7291e0f9576-exchange-whale-ratio-is-declining" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">suggest</a> that the selling pressure in the market may be diminishing right now as low values of the &#8220;exchange whale ratio&#8221; indicator imply the whales are accumulating instead of selling significantly more than the rest of the market during such periods. It further stated that the current market condition resembles the upward cycle of 2019.</li>
<li>The recent surge in the Bitcoin price was induced by the world&#8217;s largest asset manager, BlackRock, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/blackrock-files-bitcoin-spot-etf-application-taps-coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">filing</a> an application to the SEC for a spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF).</li>
<li>The development soon encouraged two more US asset managers &#8211; WisdomTree and Invesco &#8211; to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/after-blackrock-two-more-asset-managers-file-to-launch-a-btc-etf-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">file</a> fresh ETF applications last week, with Valkyrie following suit shortly after.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[The crypto scammer purportedly drained more than $2 million from Hayne and five other prisoners at Cooma Correctional Centre.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Jarryd Hayne &#8211; a former NRL superstar &#8211; has supposedly parted with $780,000 after falling prey in a Bitcoin scam. The athlete, who was slammed with a prison sentence for allegedly raping a woman, was tricked by a fellow inmate.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The scammer is currently in jail after being accused of swindling $4.6 million from family and friends in a Ponzi scheme.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Conned Even Behind Bars</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/nrl/article-12228675/Fallen-NRL-star-Jarryd-Hayne-allegedly-loses-780K-duped-inmate-Bitcoin-scam.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reported</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> by Daily Mail, the person in charge of the Bitcoin fraud was Ishan Seenar Sappideen, who met Hayne in the prison of Cooma, Australia. The former promised a significant return on investment related to the primary cryptocurrency to the ex-rugby player and other inmates. To present himself as an expert in the field, he claimed he had previously earnt nearly $300 million for clients.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Six fellow prisoners, including Hayne, bit the hook and transferred over $2 million between 2020 and 2022. The funds were sent by people outside the jail into accounts controlled by Sappideen due to the lack of online access in the facility.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite having a settlement that protects his six-figure investment, the whereabouts of Hayne&#8217;s funds remain </span>unknown.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Australian law enforcement agents organized the transfer of Sappideen to another correctional facility following the information about his alleged fraud.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Earlier this year, CSNSW intelligence officers became aware of allegations an inmate at Cooma Correctional Centre was attempting to coerce and advise fellow inmates to make transactions on the financial markets. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The accused inmate … has since had his security classification reviewed to enable a higher level of supervision and less freedom. CSNSW refers suspected criminal activity to the Police Corrections Intelligence Unit who shares intelligence with relevant state and federal police,&#8221; a spokeswoman added.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Hayne, who became a world rugby champion with Australia in 2013, was charged with aggravated sexual assault over a woman in Newcastle in 2019. He was recently found guilty of two counts of sexual intercourse without consent and sentenced to spend at least three years in prison.<br />

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Brazilian soccer players &#8211; Gustavo Scarpa, Mayke Rocha de Oliveira, and Willian Bigode &#8211; have also put their names on the list of athletes lured by cryptocurrency fraudsters.

			            <description><![CDATA[Anonymous callers placing fake bomb threats are trying to extort thousands of dollars in Bitcoin from employees of various retailers.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A slew of major U.S. grocery chains have been targeted by scammers in recent months posing fake bomb threats with demands for ransom payments.</p>
<p>While often involving cash or gift cards, the scammers have sometimes requested that their victims pay them in Bitcoin (BTC).</p>
<h2>The Supermarket Scam</h2>
<p>As <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/scammers-target-stores-with-bomb-threats-seeking-bitcoin-and-gift-cards-49a2e87c?page=1" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">reported</a> by the Wall Street Journal on Sunday, companies like Kroger, Walmart, Whole Foods Market have been targeted by the scam at various stores across and Wisconsin, with scammers threatening to detonate bombs if payments weren’t made. Law enforcement is already investigating the issue.</p>
<p>In a suburb north of Chicago, a Whole Foods employee received a call claiming that a pipe bomb had been placed in the building and said he would detonate it unless paid with $5,000 in BTC. A Kroger employee in Mexico received a similar threat demanding a wire payment, claiming a bomb would explode if the employee tried calling the police.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, employees did contact authorities, and police helped evacuate each store. No suspicious items were found in either situation.</p>
<p>According to industry experts, bomb threats demanding ransom from retailers are a newer form of extortion that began earlier this year.</p>
<p>“Every single day, we worry about safety and take everything extremely serious,” said Rodney McMullen, chief executive of Kroger. The retailer is already cooperating with local law enforcement and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The FBI said that members of the public should stay aware of their surroundings and report suspicious activity to law enforcement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, local police in the relevant areas are trying to investigate the threat, but are having trouble tracking the scammer down because the callers used hacked phone numbers. Authorities say it&#8217;s still unclear where callers are located, or whether they’re operating as part of an organized effort.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin and Ransom</h2>
<p>Bitcoin has become a popular tool for facilitating ransom payments thanks to its global nature, relative privacy, and immunity to transaction reversals. In May, a Russian man named Mikhail Pavlovich Matveev was <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/russian-man-charged-for-200-million-in-ransomware-crimes-involving-crypto/" data-wpel-link="internal">charged</a> for working with co-conspirators to extort $200 million in payments across multiple ransomware strains, much of which came through crypto.</p>
<p>In 2022, Ransomware payments in crypto <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ransomware-revenue-drops-amidst-less-successful-extortion-attempts-chainalysis/" data-wpel-link="internal">fell substantially</a> compared to 2021 as victims became less willing to make the transfers. U.S. Treasury sanctions rules against making such payments have made them riskier for victims to conduct.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[Press Release &#8211; Geneva, Switzerland, June 26th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p>TRON DAO is pleased to announce that Arkham, the leading blockchain intelligence platform, has launched support for the TRON blockchain.</p>
<p>Arkham deanonymize blockchains by showing users the people and companies behind cryptocurrency transactions. Arkham’s support for the TRON blockchain will enable traders and researchers to track the entities on TRON using Arkham’s AI-powered analytics engine.</p>
<p>TRON is the world’s leading blockchain by number of daily active addresses. It averages over 2 million daily this month, which surpasses both Ethereum and Bitcoin. It is the 2nd largest blockchain by total value locked. The TRON-Arkham partnership thus represents a major step forward in Arkham’s coverage of global blockchain activity.</p>
<blockquote><p>“This partnership aligns perfectly with our values, offering our millions of users the ability to dive deeper into the blockchain than ever before,” says a spokesperson of TRON DAO. “Arkham&#8217;s cutting-edge analytics engine will bring a new level of understanding to the TRON blockchain, allowing traders and researchers to map out the entities within our network. Together with Arkham, we aim to revolutionize the way people view and interact with the blockchain.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Miguel Morel, Founder and CEO of Arkham, also added, “We’re delighted to have TRON as a partner, as we launch support for their blockchain on Arkham. They’ve achieved a significance which few other blockchains have, particularly in the Asian market, where Arkham is deeply committed to growing our presence.”</p>
<p><strong>About TRON DAO</strong></p>
<p>TRON DAO is a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps.</p>
<p>Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of June 2023, it has over 168.8 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 5.97 billion total transactions, and over $12.49 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN.</p>
<p>In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government’s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (“DMC”), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica’s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens &#8211; TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.</p>

<p><strong>About Arkham</strong></p>
<p>Arkham is deanonymizing the blockchain. With backing from the founders of Palantir and OpenAI, Arkham is building a crypto intelligence platform that shows users the people and companies behind blockchain activity and addresses, along with advanced data and analytics about their behavior. To deanonymize blockchain users and match them to identities, Arkham uses Ultra, a proprietary AI-powered address-matching engine.

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[Press Release &#8211; Los Angeles, USA, June 26th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p>Deso is thrilled to announce they have joined forces with the leading Sui Wallet, Ethos, to integrate <a href="https://heroswap.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">HeroSwap</a>, the instant anonymous cross-chain swapping service for crypto. This collaboration elevates the user experience on Sui by providing developers, traders, and creators with an easy and efficient way to onboard into the Sui blockchain while driving more liquidity into the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Now, Sui users can swap assets between Bitcoin, Ethereum, DeSo, Solana, and more while using <a href="https://ethoswallet.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Ethos</a>. This is a pivotal moment in crypto, paving the way for seamless crypto swapping across all major blockchains while allowing users to remain anonymous and maintain full self-custody of their coins.</p>
<p>Recently, Ethos secured seed funding of $4.2 million, with contributions from notable VC firms like Boldstart Ventures and gumi Cryptos Capital (gCC) and participation from Mysten Labs. Ethos was founded with a vision to transform the crypto wallet-to-wallet experience by co-founders Nadia Eldeib (CEO) and Jared Cosulich (CTO). Ethos aims to deliver a user-friendly and secure wallet for storing crypto and discovering new apps, games, and NFTs in the SUI ecosystem.</p>
<p>Despite the immense potential of layer-1 blockchains, liquidity fragmentation and isolation have posed significant challenges for developers and everyday users, restricting cross-chain marketplace exposure and liquidity onboarding. Ethos co-founder Nadia Eldeib recognizes blockchain&#8217;s potential to transform billions of lives, stressing the need for a seamless UX for developers and consumers across different platforms.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The current web3 wallet experience is designed to store digital assets, but it has the potential to become so much more! At Ethos, our goal is to create a web3 gateway for SUI, and the greater blockchain ecosystem, that allows everyday users to interact cross-chain while discovering new apps, games, and NFTs in the SUI ecosystem.” – Ethos co-founder Nadia Eldeib.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is where HeroSwap comes into play. <a href="https://heroswap.com/embed" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Embedding HeroSwap</a>, powered by DeSo’s Smart Services, the Ethos Wallet allows for nearly instant and anonymous cross-chain swaps while maintaining custody of your coins. This mitigates the risk of unforeseen CEX blowups where users&#8217; assets are locked up or outright lost, as we’ve seen with FTX and countless others.</p>

<p>With HeroSwap, cross-chain ecosystems like Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin, and DeSo become instantly accessible for Sui users. They can now explore different layer-1 blockchains with ease while using Ethos as a central web3 hub that securely maintains all their crypto assets.</p>
<p>If Sui users want to avoid volatility, they can instantly swap into USDC or USDT using HeroSwap. Additionally, HeroSwap has frictionless zero login, so users never have to share sensitive personal information with centralized intermediaries.</p>
<p>DeSo Founder, Nader Al-Naji, is confident that HeroSwap holds the key to consumer-facing crypto applications that reach billions of users, redefining interoperability and composability:</p>
<blockquote><p>“HeroSwap unlocks the potential for consumer-facing crypto apps to reach billions of users. It&#8217;s redefining interoperability and composability for all crypto applications, and it can be integrated with any web3 app with just a single line of code. The added bonus is that all swaps are nearly instant and anonymous, allowing developers and users to mitigate the risk of losing their assets to centralized exchange meltdowns while maintaining custody of their coins.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The integration of HeroSwap into the Ethos wallet is the second DeSo partnership in the <a href="https://sui.hyperspace.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Sui ecosystem</a>. Teams that incorporate HeroSwap into their crypto apps not only improve user experience through ease of onboarding but also stand to earn a percentage of every swap from the permissionless revenue-sharing program. The integration process is simple, easy, and only takes a few minutes of time.</p>
