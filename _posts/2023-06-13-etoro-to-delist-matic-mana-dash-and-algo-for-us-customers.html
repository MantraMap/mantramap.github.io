SEC Action Leads eToro to Delist Four Tokens
<p>eToro ended support for these tokens as part of an ongoing review process.</p>
<p>The firm cited &ldquo;recent developments&rdquo; for the move, referring to the SEC&rsquo;s legal action against Binance and Coinbase.</p>

<p>&ldquo;eToro has a framework in place which reviews the cryptoassets we offer in light of the rapidly evolving regulatory landscape. Due to recent developments, we will be making some changes to our crypto offering for US customers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the lawsuit against Binance, the SEC called several popular crypto tokens unregistered securities. The suit named Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), Solana (SOL), Cosmos Hub (ATOM), Filecoin (FIL), Decentraland (MANA), Algorand (ALGO), The Sandbox (SAND), Coti (COTI), and Axie Infinity (AXS).</p>
<p>The platform will only halt purchases for the four tokens mentioned and said it remains a supporter of crypto assets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We remain a supporter of crypto assets and believe in the importance of offering our users access to a diversified range of asset classes, which includes stocks, ETFs, and options. We are committed to working closely with regulators around the world to shape the future of the crypto industry and champion access for the ordinary investor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>eToro&rsquo;s decision comes after its competitor Robinhood announced it would end support for ADA, SOL, and MATIC.</p>
