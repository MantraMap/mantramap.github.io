<p>Road Town, BVI, July 24th, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>In a recent engaging conversation hosted by LBank, the persisting implications of the XRP court case on the cryptocurrency market were examined. Despite a tentative win for XRP, experts on the panel agreed that the legal challenges are far from concluded. The discussion also delved into the importance of robust infrastructure in the cryptocurrency domain and how it continues to be a magnet for venture capitalist investments. The burgeoning sector of blockchain gaming and the future of on-chain gaming platforms were other key talking points.</p><p>Founder of Network Spotlight, Mikhail, shared his insights on the potential impact of the XRP case on funding within the Web 3.0 ecosystem. He emphasized the necessity for project builders to outpace investors in understanding their domain given their specialist status. He further advised founders to stress their domain expertise, deep understanding of the solutions they offer, and ability to adapt in an ever-evolving industry.</p><p>Michael Rippe, CCO of zkHoldem, a company specializing in blockchain-based Texas Hold'em, expressed a hopeful outlook for XRP and the broader crypto market despite the pending resolution of the XRP case.</p><p>Michael Lee, Director of Corporate Development at the South Korean gaming firm, Come to us, outlined their new initiative, Explore and Play (X PLA), and their transformation into a transmedia entity. He emphasized their dedication to the evolving landscape of Web 3.0.</p><p>Manuel Vazquez, CEO of OscarSwap, succinctly clarified the relationship between Ripple and XRP, noting that XRP existed prior to Ripple's inception and was adopted by Ripple as a store of value. He pointed out that while Ripple's method of offering XRP to institutional investors is under investigation, XRP's decentralized nature disqualifies it from being classified as a security.</p><p>Echoing Vazquez's explanation of the Ripple-XRP relationship and the ongoing SEC legal issues, Sam, AMA Host at Future Lounge, conveyed his optimism for the crypto sphere, suggesting that victories in these cases will bolster confidence in the continued expansion of the crypto sector.</p><p>Alexandre Raffin, CEO of GAINS, concluded the discussion by underscoring the importance of generating authentic value in the gaming and crypto sectors.
