The consolation phase lasted for around six weeks. And offered a short break period for sellers before resuming the downtrend. Thus, prices may rebound from $9.95 support to replenish bearish momentum.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A potential bullish reversal from the $9.45 support may encourage a bullish upswing of 20%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The oversold RSI increases the possibility of a bullish reversal</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 24-hour trading volume in the Solana coin is $1.15 Billion, indicating a 162% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/d/DxkB3p3v.png" alt="TradingView Chart" /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On December 22nd, the coin breached the $11.9 support and<a href="https://coingape.com/solana-price-drops-to-single-digits-whats-next-for-solana/"> tumbled price</a> 20% down to hit the $9.45 mark. Furthermore, the sellers tried to breach this level, but the buyers are aggressively defending this level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On December 29th, the daily candle showed a Doji-type candle with long wicks on both sides. This indecisive candle after a sharp fall suggests the market participant are struggling to carry on the further downfall. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the press time, the SOL price trades at $9.84 and trying to sustain above the $9.45 support. With sustained buying,  the coin holders may witness a relief rally to retest the $11.85 breached support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, with ongoing negativity in the crypto market, this temporary bullish recovery may turn down the prices from the $11.85 mark and resume the prior downfall.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, the bearish thesis will weaken if the SOL price breaks out from the mentioned resistance.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>RSI:</strong> the indicator value at 28% indicates the traders have overextended the selling activity. Moreover, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> reverting from this oversold region increases the possibility of a relief rally to stabilize the excess selling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs:</strong> The large gap between the downsloping EMAs(20, 50, 100, and 200) accentuates an established downtrend. Moreover, the 20-day EMA act as dynamic resistance to SOL price.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solana Coin</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Price Intraday Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $9.93</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish </span></li>

<h2>XRP Price To Fall Further?</h2>
<p>According to crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe, the XRP token has run into significant resistance at the level of $0.37. He also mentioned that based on the recent price movement, the preferred option is to see the token reclaim the $0.343 level relatively quickly. He expressed these thoughts in a tweet on December 30.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More:</strong> <a title="Is India Moving Towards Banning Crypto Assets In Its G20 Presidency?" href="https://coingape.com/india-prohibiting-banning-crypto-g20-presidency/" rel="bookmark">Is India Moving Towards Banning Crypto Assets In Its G20 Presidency?</a></em></p>
<p>If the price however does not recover, Michael believes that there is likely a considerable amount of liquidity on the downside that might be taken advantage of. He also drew parallels between the current state of XRP and the recent performance of Bitcoin (BTC).</p>
<p>Additionally, he emphasized that investors should keep a close eye on the $0.265 level, as this is often regarded as a significant support level for XRP.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Request 01 &#8211; <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24XRP&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$XRP</a></p>
<p>This one looks a bit odd, as we&#39;ve seen a harsh rejection at $0.37.</p>
<p>I&#39;d prefer to see <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24XRP&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$XRP</a> reclaim the level at $0.343 relatively fast, otherwise, a ton of liquidity is on the downside to be taken (comparable with <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a>).</p>
<p>$0.265 massive support. <a href="https://t.co/wgYN5JLye1">pic.twitter.com/wgYN5JLye1</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1608831749202784256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 30, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>XRP Price Flashes Sell Signal</h2>
<p>Echoing Michael&#8217;s thoughts, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> trader Ali Martinez, who tweets under the handle @ali charts, is of the opinion that the price of XRP might see a pause in its surge due to certain technical signals. Martinez points out that the TD (Tom Denmark) Sequential, an instrumental tool designed to identify the exact time of trend exhaustion and price reversal, is indicating a strong &#8220;sell signal&#8221; on the price chart for XRP&#8217;s four-hour time frame.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoin</a> has been trading in a stagnant range over the past few weeks. This is because investors have been unable to identify any bullish catalysts in the ongoing dispute between Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://coingape.com/tag/sec/">SEC</a>). In addition to this, the asset is suffering as a direct result of the repercussions that were caused by the collapse of the FTX <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">crypto exchange</a>.</p>
<p>Currently, as per <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xrp/">CoinMarketCap</a>, the price of XRP is trading at around $0.34, with a 0.78% increase in the past one hour and a whopping 2.56% decrease recorded in the last seven days, at the time of writing.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Crypto Bull Run Ahead? The year 2022 proved to be a painful ride for the digital asset industry.

The global crypto market cap of $2.2 trillion has dropped below the $800 billion mark. The biggest of the cryptos like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) prices have dropped by a massive 65% and 69% on the year to date (YTD), respectively.</p>
<p>However,<a href="https://coingape.com/education/what-is-inflation-what-causes-it-and-its-effects-4-examples-of-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> high inflation sentiments</a> left physical gold outperforming Bitcoin massively. This proved to be the second worst YTD return for Bitcoin since its launch. Meanwhile, few cryptos were able to absorb the turbulence this year while there was some apparent winner this year.</p>
<h2>Crypto bull run in 2023?</h2>
<p>As per the report, BTC’s recent price drop closely depicts <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bear-market-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the bear market</a> patterns which can be found in the previous cycles. The 2018 bear market lasted for more than 364 days while the 2014-15 bear market lasted for around 407 long days.</p>
<p>Bitcoin price has bottomed 376 days after peaking but if BTC reaches the bottom in 2023 then it will be the longest drawdown ever. However, there are several potential catalysts ahead. FTX proceedings can urge the regulators to make tougher rules for the crypto market.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, experts believe that this is a positive signal related to the U.S. spot BTC ETF launches. This will lead to a better classification of tokens as a plausible outcome by the end of the year.</p>
<h2>What can effect crypto market?</h2>
<p>The European Union Parliament is yet to vote on the MiCA bill in February 2023. However, the effect of the bill will be 12 to 18 months to cover the complete market. The next in line SEC’s Grayscale lawsuit will make progress in the first quarter of 2023.</p>
<p>The tightening macro situation and Bitcoin correlation to macro analogies to the last bear market will be the bigger space to build BTC exposure.</p>
<p>A low trading activity will be the key trend in the year 2013. The crypto market might look more boring than in the previous three years. Expert hints that patience and long term positioning will be the key for investors.</p>
<h2>BTC price to surge?</h2>
<p>It is predicted that <a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-analysts-predict-bitcoin-price-2023/?utm_source=24hrsupdateall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin price</a> will trade in a flat range this year. However, BTC price will 2023 close at a higher price than the yearly opening. The correlation between Bitcoin and equities is expected to soften up as trading activity in crypto witnessed a decline.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1886" height="1414" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/30222908/crypto1.jpg" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="crypto face another crash" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" /><p>After the dreadful 2018 <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-winter-2/#:~:text=Crypto%20Winter%20refers%20to%20a,perceived%20as%20risky%20to%20trade.">crypto winter</a>, the year 2022 marked the start of a new bear trend which was distinguished by the failure of prominent crypto businesses across the board. It was further accompanied by the precipitous decrease in the value of cryptocurrencies and the larger global market meltdown. This has now led to the dilemma of the crypto market&#8217;s direction for the coming year 2023.</p>
<h2>Crypto To Face Another Crash?</h2>
<p>After conducting extensive research into <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">crypto exchange&#8217;s</a> netflow and historical indicators, a number of prominent hypotheses have been established by leading crypto analysts in the industry.</p>
<p>According to the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://cryptoquant.com/quicktake/63aef3902fce6a57fced77c2-Exchanges-Netflow-After-a-local-top-we-will-face-increased-sales-pressure">data</a>, the netflow will eventually become positive once it advances closer and closer to zero. This results in a lower number of buyers and a greater number of sellers. It is likely that at the same time that it turns positive, a local peak will be observed, followed by an increase in the amount of selling pressure on the future market. This can lead to a continuation of the downward trend and the loss of support that is currently in place.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-133683 size-full" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/30220340/f0uJxGM_fb3c9ce9376d6d36461e6d9a07ab778fbbd235085ab5a564c3545fa8deabcd98.png" alt="crypto face another crash" width="1280" height="553" /></p>
<p>The &#8220;exchange netflow&#8221; is an indicator that gauges the total net amount of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> that is moving into or out of the wallets of all <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/centralized-cryptocurrency-exchanges-cex/">centralized exchanges</a>. This metric can be positive or negative and the value is determined by subtracting the total amount of funds that were brought into the exchange from the total amount that was taken out.</p>

<h2>Has Bitcoin Price Bottomed?</h2>
<p>As <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-fall-to-10k-inevitable-early-2023/">reported</a> earlier by CoinGape, the price of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> is likely to drop much further given that the top cryptocurrency is not yet undervalued nor has it reached its bottom.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the degree of volatility seen in stablecoin inflows traded on spot exchanges has reached an all-time high. This suggests that Bitcoin might either begin a bull run or collapse to a new bottom in the near future.</p>
<p>As things stand, the price of Bitcoin is presently being traded at $16,532. This represents a decrease of 0.61% on the day, with a further decline of 1.85% during the week as per crypto market tracker <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" rel="nofollow">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>

This bearish contention pattern consists of a falling trendline which assists sellers on bullish rallies and fixed support levels whose breakdown will accelerate the market selling pressure. In theory, the lower high formation within this pattern reflects the inability of buyers to carry a higher recovery rally. Thus, will the gradual loss of bullish momentum, the buyers lose crucial support, which leads to a prolonged downfall. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $0.05-$0.049 support remains a high accumulation zone and neckline of the triangle pattern</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A potential bearish divergence between the 50-and-100-weekly EMA will increase the possibility of neckline breakdown</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the TRX coin is $89.5 Million, indicating an 11.2% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/6/6VWgkRnI.png" alt="Tron Price Prediction 2023" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the press time, the <a href="https://coingape.com/heres-how-much-your-100-investment-in-tron-will-be-worth-if-trx-reaches-1/">TRX price</a> traders at the $0.054 mark with an intraday gain of 0.06%. Furthermore, amid the ongoing uncertainty, the price action shows a wavering movement between the trendline and $0.05 support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The TRX price has nearly approached the peak of the triangle pattern, indicating that the price is close to breaking out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, a possible breakdown from the neckline support will intensify the bearish momentum and tumble the prices more 52% to $0.22.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, in a rare case scenario, a bullish breakout from the patterns resistance trendline is possible. If market sentiment improves, the Tron coin price could give a bullish breakout from the overhead trendline and start a fresh recovery rally. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an ideal condition, the bullish breakout may lead a price rally to the triangle’s highest peak, which for TRX price is $0.15.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicators</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Relative Strength Index:</strong> even though the price action maintains fixed support, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">weekly-RSI slope</a> shows a lower low formation indicating the buyers have a weak hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs:</strong> the 200-weekly EMA is moving around the $0.054 strength of the support power of this level. However, the other EMAs(20, 50, 100) moving above the price will act as significant resistance.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terra Classic Coin</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Price Intraday Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $0.054</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish </span></li>

Under the influence of this pattern, the buyers should start a fresh recovery rally upon the breakout of its trendline. Thus, this pattern could assist buyers in regaining trend control.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $0.000008 Level Stands As A High Accumulation Zone</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/u/upyWwany.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During June 2022, the Shiba Inu coin price showed a sharp bullish reversal from the $0.000008 support, which led to a 125% bull run to the $0.000018 mark. Moreover, over the past three weeks, this memecoin has three retested this support indicating the buyers are actively defending this level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, the long lower price rejection wicks attached to the weekly candle accentuate the intense demand pressure at $0.000008. Thus, if the market condition improves, the SHIB price has a high possibility of rebounding from this level.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shiba Inu Coin Forms A Bullish pattern</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/7/7gNUxaBE.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last two months&#8217; downfall in Shib price Inu price has revealed the formation of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/wedge-pattern/">falling wedge pattern</a>. In theory, this price action narrowing between two converging trendlines indicates the losing bearish momentum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The coin price gradually squeezing between the trendlines will soon provide a breakout opportunity. In ideal bullish conditions, an upside breakout from this resistance trendline will surge the prices 30% higher to $0.0000105. </span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relative Strenght index</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">Relative Strenght index(RSI)</a> indicates the strength of the recent price action. Concerning the lower low formation in SHIB price, the daily RSI slope rising higher indicate growth in underlying bullish momentum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, a positive divergence between price action and indicator accentuates a higher possibility for a price rally.</span></p>
<p><b>Current Price Action</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the recent uncertainty in the crypto market, the SHIB price is plunged back to the pattern’s support trendline, hoping to replenish the bullish momentum. The possible reversal from this support trendline will drive the price 6% higher to rechallenge the overhead trendline.</span></p>
<ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1082" height="670" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/30191635/Peter-Schiff-Bitcoin-bashing.jpeg" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="Peter Schiff" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" /><p>Peter Schiff has taken to Twitter to say that Bitcoin prices will fall further in 2023, and Bitcoin holders’ confidence will be shaken. Schiff is a noted economist and skeptic of cryptocurrencies who has been expressing his skepticism through Musk’s Twitter.</p>
<p>Schiff in his tweet mentioned that the people who are loyal to Bitcoin think that the price of the crypto will rise in 2023. He said that Bitcoin will fall under 5000 USD in the coming year and that will shake the confidence of the Bitcoin holders.</p>
<p>The economist is getting mocked for the ridiculous prediction.</p>
<h2>Schiff and his Bitcoin criticism</h2>
<p>He urged cryptocurrency holders to sell their holdings and use the proceeds to buy physical gold in a Thursday interview with TD Ameritrade Network before they lose everything.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Get out of crypto, is my counsel to folks. You may still sell your useless Bitcoin for close to 17,000 USD. I would advise you to use it to purchase some gold,&#8221; he replied.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Also read: </strong><a href="https://coingape.com/microstrategy-sells-bitcoin-btc-for-first-time-this-reason/">MicroStrategy Sells 704 Bitcoins (BTC) For First Time Due To This Reason</a></p>
<p>According to him, anyone seeking long-term value storage or an inflation hedge should not consider investing in Bitcoin. It is just worthless, he tweeted. &#8220;Its market price has dropped by two-thirds.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Schiff targets Saylor yet again</h2>
<p>A few hours back he also took a dig at Saylor. He has stated once more that MicroStrategy Incorporated&#8217;s stockholders would be held responsible for Chairman Michael Saylor&#8217;s preoccupation with Bitcoin (BTC). On Twitter, Schiff noted that the company&#8217;s shares had fallen to a 52-week low and they have fallen by a staggering 90% from their all-time high, which they hit back in February 2021.</p>
<p>Peter Schiff, who frequently criticizes investing decisions, is undoubtedly the most outspoken opponent of the most popular digital currency. MicroStrategy is a well-known provider of business intelligence and technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Also read: </strong><a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-michael-saylors-microstrategy-buys-2395-bitcoins/">Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy Buys 2,500 Bitcoins</a></p>
<h2>Attacks on MicroStrategy</h2>
<p>MicroStrategy has acquired up to 132,500 Bitcoin units so far, worth over 4 billion USD. In order to acquire the digital assets over time, MicroStrategy had to issue Senior Convertible Notes. It is a debt instrument, with the majority of these funds coming from the company&#8217;s surplus balance sheet cash. Michael Saylor promoted the Bitcoin ideology when he was still the company&#8217;s CEO.  He was relying on the idea that the technology underlying the cryptocurrency is capable of generating a significant price increase in the near future.</p>
<p>Peter Schiff frequently attacks MicroStrategy for making the announcement that its BTC assets will continue to be listed on its balance sheet for the foreseeable future. As a business with significant exposure to Bitcoin, MicroStrategy&#8217;s share price decline reflects the pessimistic mood sparked by the continuing crypto winter.</p>

Similarly to that, a new city is coming up named Akon City. It is developed in the western nation of Senegal. Funded and ideated by Akon, the African billionaire, and R&amp;B artist, thus, his brainchild.</p>
<h2>A detailed description of Akon city</h2>
<p>The project, which will be located approximately an hour&#8217;s drive from the capital city of Dakar, is meant to be a high-tech, ecologically friendly city that will be constructed on a 2,000-acre property in the district of Mbodiène. The Senegal government gave the musician a gift of the 2,000-acre location.</p>
<p>According to reports, Akon and a group of investors are funding the project, which aims to act as a regional centre for innovation, tourism, and economic growth. With a 6 billion USD budget, Akon first revealed his aspirations to build this futuristic city back in 2018.</p>
<p>With artificial woods surrounding the city and increasing its attractiveness in numerous ways, the city will also act as a shelter for the native flora and wildlife present in Africa.</p>
<h2>A dream city</h2>
<p>A cryptocurrency called Akoin (AKN), which is intended to be the primary method by which residents conduct transactions, will also be used in the projected city. It is created to be a pan-African money and is based on the Stellar Lumens network. It will perform the roles of both a utility token and an ecosystem of resources and offerings for business owners.</p>
<p><strong>Also read: </strong><a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-analysts-predict-bitcoin-price-2023/">Crypto Analysts Predict Bitcoin Price For 2023 As BTC Breaks Key Level</a></p>
<p>A multi-currency <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-wallets/">wallet</a> and <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/decentralized-exchange/">decentralized exchang</a>e support the coin. Users can now store and trade AKN without having to deal with the difficulties or costs associated with conventional money exchanges. Holders of tokens will be able to exchange their AKN for <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fiat-money/">fiat money</a> or buy speak time for their phones. Currently featured on BitMart, the token may be bought using significant <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrencies</a>.</p>
<h2>Difficulties faced by this crypto city</h2>
<p>Initially, the ideation of Akon city garnered a lot of enthusiasm among locals. However, with the passing of time, there has been no major progress made in the development of this dream city. A BBC report on the status of development called it a ‘land of grazing goats.’ Akon has been defending the slow progress by saying that it is because of the difficulties that came along with Covid 19.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency Akoin has seen its own set of challenges. Data shows that after its introduction in 2020, AKN traded in the 0.14 USD to 0.15 USD range. The coin then had a significant increase in value in February 2021, when it surged to an all-time high of 0.5069 USD. Once the crypto winter struck in 2022, however, everything started to go terribly wrong. The value of AKN plummeted due to the challenging bear market. Since its inception, the coin&#8217;s price has dropped by 88%, to 0.017 USD at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>Also read: </strong><a href="https://coingape.com/most-liked-crypto-tweets-of-this-year-on-twitter-year-ender-2022/">Most Liked Crypto Tweets Of This Year On Twitter</a></p>
<p>Additionally, there are some emerging problems with regard to the legitimacy of cryptocurrencies in Senegal. The CFC Franc is now the only legal tender in the country. The Central Bank of West African States is in charge of issuing and overseeing it.</p>
<p>Akon has been saying that he will fulfil all the legalities and make sure that his brainchild doesn’t die. He has also promised stakeholders about profits and returns. Akon continued by saying that progress was &#8220;100,000% going&#8221; and that he was looking forward to retiring in the metropolis he will build.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Akon City is a significant undertaking. If it succeeds, it will be crucial for boosting Senegal&#8217;s economy and enhancing the quality of life for its people. However, given the current state of affairs, it is impossible to predict when or even if the project will ever be finished.</p>

The Terra Classic validator KuCoin has reduced its voting power down to 0.21% and is ranked 44th on the validator list. The Terra Classic community believes a dump may likely come next and the LUNC price will fall further.</p>
<h2>KuCoin Undelegated All Terra Classic (LUNC) Tokens</h2>
<p>Terra Classic influencer and YouTuber ClassCrypto in a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/ClassyCrypto_/status/1608791368532635649" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweet</a> on December 30 revealed that validator KuCoin has undelegated all 48 billion LUNC tokens. KuCoin now ranks 44 on the validator list and has a voting power of 0.21%.</p>
<p>While no additional details are available on the reason behind the huge amount of LUNC undelegated, the community believes a dump may be coming soon. Some think the exchange might burn the LUNC tokens.</p>
<p>However, KuCoin released no announcement related to a single undelegation event. Therefore, it&#8217;s most likely part of the centralized exchange funds restructure. Also, KuCoin has yet to complete the second round of Terra (LUNC) airdrop to LUNC and USTC holders.</p>
<p>The FUD is again rising in the Terra Classic community as the reason remains unclear. Some are even withdrawing their LUNC tokens are transferring them to Binance.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://coingape.com/lunc-news-terra-classic-core-developer-edward-kim-proposal-up-for-voting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proposal 11168</a> by Terra Classic core developers Edward Kim and Tobias “Zaradar” is under voting. It will form a “Joint L1 Task Force” team, which will look into the maintenance upgrades and L1 layer developments on the Classic <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blockchain</a>.</p>
<h2>LUNC Price Falls After Massive Rally This Week</h2>
<p>Terra Classic (LUNC) price rallied nearly 50% in the last few days due to a breakout above the 3-month descending channel. However, a market-wide selloff and <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-binance-suspends-terra-classic-lunc-burn-lunc-price-falls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance temporarily suspending</a> LUNC burn caused the LUNC price to fell back below $0.00015.</p>
<p>The LUNC price is currently trading at $0.000165. The 24-hour low and high are $0.0001454 and $0.0001518, respectively.</p>

The prosecution was looking into allegations that the executive had stolen money from Bithumb affiliates. The local media <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://news.mt.co.kr/mtview.php?no=2022123011073638881">reported</a> this.</p>
<p>In Dongjak-gu, Seoul, Park Mo was found dead in front of his house. According to Seoul Dongjak Police Station, it happened on the morning of the 30th, at around four in the morning. However, police think Park made an extreme choice.</p>
<p>The Police official said,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Through optometric and CCTV analysis at the site, there is no other possibility so far.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Bithumb&#8217;s Shareholder was under investigation</h2>
<p>The prosecution was looking into Park on allegations of embezzlement and stock price manipulation. With a 34.22% stake in Bithumb Holdings, Vident, a KOSDAQ-listed company, is Bithumb&#8217;s largest shareholder.</p>
<p>According to rumors, Mr. Park manages the accounting for brother and sister Mr. Kang, who was thought to be the real owner of Bithumb. Prior to this, on October 7, related businesses like Vident were searched and assets were seized. However, it was done by the Financial Investigation Division 2 of the Seoul South District Prosecutor&#8217;s Office (Chief Prosecutor Chae Hee-man).</p>
<h3>Death Toll</h3>
<p>When an economic disaster occurs, people immediately want to know how much money was lost. The economic effects of the tragedy are almost exclusively covered in the media. While doing so, they ignore the true effects that these economic catastrophes have on the lives of regular people.</p>
<h4>The Man in Taiwan</h4>
<p>Taiwanese law enforcement discovered a man dead on the streets outside his apartment right after the Luna crash. He had jumped out of his window to end his life.</p>
<h4>Telangana Man</h4>
<p>Due to his cryptocurrency losses, an Indian man by the name of Ramalingaswamy decided to take the extreme step of suicide. The man reserved a hotel room, locked the door, and then ate poison.</p>

<h2>Is Solana price to take a hit ahead?</h2>
<p>Experts suggest that the Solana community is holding similar energy to the Ethereum had in the 2018-20 time period. However, it is difficult to see the investment case for Solana as it had some massive headwinds.</p>
<p>David Hoffman, co founder of Bankless stated that when <a href="https://coingape.com/ethereum-whales-sold-close-to-1-million-eth-in-december-2022-more-fall-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum price dipped</a> to $80, it didn’t have a big competitor then. However, ETH’s L2 metrics are up big throughout 2022. While its impact can be seen in the migration of L1 apps to ETH L2s.</p>
<p>Compared to the Solana price crash, Ethereum wasn’t directly connected with the largest fraud since Madoff. However, FTX and <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/alameda-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alameda research</a> collapse had a direct impact on the SOL price performance.</p>
<p>He suggested that<a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/TrustlessState/status/1608677559872671744" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"> Solana needs a social layer</a> to cleanse. However, till the Solana community will be able to restart the engine a lot of damage would be done as the competition is very stiff in the crypto market.</p>
<h2>What can help SOL now?</h2>
<p>In the end, the fate of the Solana network completely depends on its builders. The 2018-20 bear market proved to be tough and it will take a lot of work to survive this cycle. However, the bullish thing for Solana is that the value of SOL now lies in the hands of its own people.</p>
<p>Hoffman added that the SOL price at $10 is a back to the truck moment and he added some when the price dropped to $9.</p>
<p>Earlier, Coingape reported that ARK Invest Ex crypto lead is still Going <a href="https://coingape.com/solana-news-ark-invest-ex-crypto-head-goes-long-on-sol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">‘LONG’ on Solana price</a>. SOL has shed around 95% of its price value recorded on the year to date (YTD) basis.</p>

<p>The year for the crypto market has been drastic, however, tweets about crypto garnered a lot of attention on social media. Billionaire and CEO of Twitter <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a> is in the first position for having received the most likes for a tweet about cryptocurrencies.</p>
<h2>Here is the list of crypto tweets:</h2>
<h3>Tweet by Elon Musk</h3>
<p>Musk made a meme referring to the theft of FTX customers&#8217; money in a tweet from November 18 that has received 789,200 likes. He also makes fun of the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for not looking into the matter more thoroughly.</p>
<p>This tweet quickly rose to the top of the platform&#8217;s &#8220;image of the day&#8221; section when a user suggested that the wording be changed to reflect that FTX owes &#8220;almost nine billion dollars.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Tweet by Vitalik Buterin</h3>
<p>The Merge, an event that marked the completion of the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/">blockchain</a>&#8216;s shift from a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/proof-of-work-pow/">proof-of-work</a> consensus to a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos/">proof-of-stake</a> blockchain, was announced by <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/vitalik-buterin/">Vitalik Buterin</a>, the co-creator of Ethereum, on September 15.</p>
<p>The network&#8217;s energy consumption and block verification time were reduced by 99% as a result of this &#8220;huge moment&#8221; for the ecosystem, according to Buterin&#8217;s tweet. This increased daily block production.</p>
<p><strong>Also read: </strong><a href="https://coingape.com/solana-news-ark-invest-ex-crypto-head-goes-long-on-sol/">ARK Invest Ex Crypto Head Goes ‘LONG’ On Solana; Here’s Why</a></p>
<h3>Tweet by CZ</h3>
<p>Third on the list is a tweet dated Aug. 2 from <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/changpeng-zhao/">CZ</a>, the CEO and co-founder of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/binance/">Binance</a>, with the third-most likes.</p>
<p>The Wormhole drain of $325 million in February and the 625 million USD theft from the Ronin blockchain in March were the two largest bridge hacks in 2022. On that day, the Nomad crypto bridge had lost more than $190 million to hackers.</p>
<p>The tweet from CZ probably alludes to the conflict between trustworthy and dishonest players in the market and encourages adopting cryptocurrency for its intended use.</p>
<h3>Tweet by Nayib Bukele</h3>
<p>Nayib Bukele, the president of El Salvador, the first nation to make bitcoin legal tender, tweeted on May 9 that he had &#8220;purchased the dip&#8221; in the cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>This tweet, which has 100,200 likes, was posted on the day the Terra stablecoin UST dropped to 95 cents amid extreme volatility. The bear market for this year began when Terra&#8217;s native asset, LUNA, fell to zero at the end of that week.</p>
<p>The average price of bitcoin was around $30,000 this week in May, levels last seen in July 2021, but the price has been steadily declining throughout the year. From Nov. 17 onward, Bukele committed to purchasing one bitcoin daily at an average cost of $16,815 per coin, according to NayibTracker.</p>

<h3>Tweet by Michael Saylor</h3>
<p>With a tweet sent out earlier in the morning on the same day as Bukele, MicroStrategy creator Michael Saylor comes in fifth.</p>
<p>Saylor, who is regarded as a bitcoin maximalist, tweeted that it was &#8220;time to get back to work&#8221; next to a picture of himself working behind a counter at McDonald&#8217;s while wearing a uniform.</p>
<p>Saylor was making reference to the joke about needing to obtain a fast food job if the price of cryptocurrencies kept down, which reflected the declining price of Bitcoin.</p>
<h3>Tweet by SBF</h3>
<p>Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced former CEO of FTX, garnered the most likes for his thread of apologies. He claimed at the time, &#8220;I fucked up and should have done better.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 22-part tweet was posted the day before Bankman-Fried resigned as CEO of the FTX Group and the cryptocurrency exchange, along with about 130 other companies connected to the FTX Group, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.</p>

With the crucial support of $16.5K now broken, crypto analysts predict more narrow-range, sideways trading in the coming days. On-chain data indicates 2023 as a positive year for the crypto market.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price To End 2022 Below Crucial Support $16.5K?</h2>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-fall-to-10k-inevitable-early-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As reported earlier</a> by CoinGape, Bitcoin&#8217;s (BTC) price is likely to fall further as Bitcoin is not undervalued yet or bottomed out. Several on-chain indicators such as MVRV, NUPL, Puell Multiple, and SOPR indicate that Bitcoin is undervalued. Traders can use the UTXOs in Profit and Loss on-chain data to find an exact level where Bitcoin can be considered undervalued.</p>

<p>According to the Spot Exchanges Stablecoin Reserves on-chain data, the reserves have reached to the pre-2021 <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bull-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bull market</a> run levels. Moreover, volatility in <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/stablecoins-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stablecoin</a> inflows on spot exchanges is at an all-time high. It indicates that Bitcoin could either start a bull run or fall to a new low.</p>

<h2>Here&#8217;s What Crypto Analysts Predict For 2023</h2>
<p>Crypto analyst CredibleCrypto believes BTC price can only go to $15.6K if Bitcoin ends the month below $16.5K. However, he agrees with BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes that the <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-prediction-btc-price-100k-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC price can hit $100K</a> by the 2023 end or early 2024.</p>
<p>Analyst <a href="https://coingape.com/popular-analyst-predicts-bitcoin-btc-eth-ada-link-price-for-new-year-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rekt Capital suggested</a> that the BTC price needs a monthly close above $16.8K to rally higher, otherwise it will see a downfall below $15,000.</p>

It will become a major trend in the technology sector in the upcoming years. Although the metaverse itself is nothing, its technologies give it life.</p>
<p>The metaverse is a persistent, open, and shared virtual space in which users can exist as digital avatars. The metaverse is built on the idea that users can perform any action in the virtual world that they can in the physical one. However, the metaverse is still in its early stages, though. While B2C businesses continue to establish a presence in the Metaverse, a fully functional virtual reality is still a few stoplights away.</p>
<h2>Top 5 technologies that power the Metaverse</h2>
<h3>Virtual and augmented reality</h3>
<p>Immersive gaming has long made use of <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/year-ender-top-3-metaverse-trends-to-watch-of-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR)</a></strong>. It is clear how these technologies are used in the Metaverse, and both the Metaverse and immersive technology will develop further. With advancements in wearable technology, you can add full-body sensors to AR and VR technology to create an immersive experience.</p>
<p>In the past few years, VR has become more crucial due to the demand for a safe distance. In order to allow attendees to attend and interact with others just like they would in real life, several in-person events were VR-enabled. Despite still being in its infancy, augmented reality is a more user-friendly option for immersive experiences. Augmented reality adds virtual elements to the user&#8217;s real-world surroundings rather than creating an entirely virtual environment.</p>
<h3>Blockchain</h3>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blockchain</a> technology will be used to power the Metaverse. The technology that underpins cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum is called a blockchain. Blockchain is a distributed, decentralized ledger that publicly and chronologically records transactions. This renders it secure and tamper-proof. In the Metaverse, assets will be purchased, sold, and traded using cryptocurrencies. They are it already.</p>
<h3>Hybrid and distributed cloud environments</h3>
<p>The adoption of cloud computing makes complete sense given that hosting 3D environments requires significant computing and storage resources. Cloud computing companies like AWS, Azure, Oracle Cloud, and Google Cloud Platforms may offer a more optimized cloud environment for the Metaverse, depending on how widely used the Metaverse and its offerings are.</p>
<p>Making sure that users&#8217; experiences are not harmed by bandwidth restrictions and internet connectivity outages is one of the major challenges facing Metaverse cloud providers. Furthermore, it is a given that the requirements of the Metaverse will extend to the secure storage of personally identifiable information, which is a requirement of nearly every nation.</p>
<h3>Artificial intelligence</h3>
<p>Introducing <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">artificial intelligence</a> is unnecessary. For many years, it has been the focus of our culture. Interest in and investments in this technology have significantly increased over the past few years. This year, the AI market will generate $62 billion, as predicted by Gartner. AI will be used in the Metaverse for many different purposes, including making digital avatars, handling payments, and managing resources. For instance, you can create a digital avatar in Decentraland using the Ava app. The app creates a 3D model of your face using AI.</p>
<h3>Web 3.0</h3>
<p>It is the next iteration of the internet, to put it simply. The web is now smarter, easier to use, and safer. Web 2.0, the current web, is built on centralized programs like Facebook and Google. It will be decentralized in Web 3.0. There won&#8217;t be a single point of control or failure as a result. On <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/web-3-0/">Web 3.0</a>, the Metaverse will be constructed.
