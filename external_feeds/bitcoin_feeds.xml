Notably, even amidst this hiatus, users can continue to hold their crypto within the Paypal ecosystem and are free to liquidate their digital holdings whenever they wish.</strong></p>
<h2>Paypal Temporarily Halts UK Cryptocurrency Buys</h2>
<p>British Paypal users will find their ability to acquire digital currencies curtailed post-October 1, 2023. This temporary measure, as highlighted in an <a href="https://twitter.com/Crypto_Crib_/status/1691661748359614481?s=20">email</a> to U.K. customers, is set to last until sometime in the early part of 2024, with the company assuring, &#8220;We expect to re-enable crypto purchases in early 2024.&#8221;</p>
<p>This development trails Paypal&#8217;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/payments-giant-paypal-launches-dollar-backed-stablecoin-pyusd/">introduction</a> of a stablecoin, PYUSD, anchored to the U.S. dollar&#8217;s value. To reflect on the timeline, Paypal had <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/paypal-launches-cryptocurrency-services-in-uk/">unveiled</a> its crypto services in the U.K. in August 2021, with a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/paypal-completes-rollout-crypto-offering-uk-first-international-expansion-outside-us/">full-fledged deployment</a> by September. From that juncture, users could transact in four diverse digital currencies.</p>

<p>The catalyst behind this interim cessation? Paypal cites the “new rules enacted by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) that require crypto firms to implement additional steps before customers can purchase crypto.” The digital payment juggernaut elaborated, “While we work to satisfy these new regulations, you won&#8217;t be able to buy crypto using Paypal.”</p>
<p>Emphasizing its stringent adherence to regulatory frameworks, Paypal added:</p>
<blockquote><p>We remain deeply committed to our compliance obligations and Paypal consistently works closely with regulators around the world to adhere to applicable rules and regulations in the markets in which we operate.</p></blockquote>
<p>Though the email remains non-committal on a specific restart date, Paypal expressed its regret for the potential inconvenience. The company reassured its U.K. customer base, promising to alert them once the service is back in action, enabling them to dive back into crypto acquisitions.</p>

While the company remains tight-lipped about the participants in this financial endeavor, this fresh infusion of capital catapults the firm&#8217;s post-valuation to $1.75 billion.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitgo Raises $100 Million From Undisclosed Investors</h2>
<p>Bitgo has successfully bagged $100 million in a Series C funding round, with the investors&#8217; names under wraps, as per a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-16/bitgo-bucks-crypto-downturn-to-raise-funding-at-1-75-billion-valuation">report</a>. Bitgo’s top executive, Mike Belshe, acknowledged the challenging market landscape. Yet, he emphasized the company’s commitment to licensing and regulatory measures, noting, “Regulatory safety is top-of-mind for everyone,” in a conversation with Bloomberg&#8217;s Hannah Miller.</p>
<p>This update comes on the heels of Galaxy Digital <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/galaxy-digital-terminates-1-2-billion-bitgo-acquisition-deal-crypto-firm-still-plans-for-nasdaq-listing/">scrapping</a> its intentions to snap up Bitgo for a cool $1.2 billion in August 2022. Earlier, in June, Bitgo had its eyes on the beleaguered crypto custodian, Prime Trust, with <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/digital-asset-trust-firm-bitgo-sets-sights-on-prime-trust-acquisition/">acquisition plans</a>. However, the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitgo-abandons-acquisition-of-prime-trust-amidst-nevada-based-custodians-ongoing-uncertainty/">deal fell through</a>. Prime Trust soon found itself <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/from-crypto-custodian-to-court-prime-trust-files-for-bankruptcy-protection/">filing</a> for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection the following month.</p>

<p>Though the Prime Trust deal went south, Belshe indicated to Miller that a portion of this fresh capital would fuel future acquisitions. He alluded to two potential buyouts already in the pipeline, as cited by Miller. While Bitgo remains mum on this round&#8217;s backers, past investors have featured big names like Pantera Capital, Digital Currency Group, Redpoint, Goldman Sachs, and DRW Holdings.</p>

Bearish sentiment remained high as the session progressed, with the global market cap falling by nearly 2% today. <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> also plunged in today&#x2019;s session.</strong></p>
<h2>Dogecoin (DOGE)</h2>
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) fell for a fourth straight session, as bears continue to regain momentum, following last week&#x2019;s gains.</p>
<p>After peaking at $0.07407 on Tuesday, DOGE/USD dropped to an intraday low of $0.06893 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>As a result of this fall in price, dogecoin slipped to its lowest level since July 19, when price was at a bottom of $0.0682.</p>

<p>The decline comes following a downward crossover of the moving averages, which is also known as a death cross.</p>
<p>This week&#x2019;s bearish momentum intensified after DOGE moved below a support point at $0.0730.</p>
<p>Additionally, the relative strength index (RSI) also edged lower, dropping to a reading of 39.10, its lowest in four weeks.</p>

<h2><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a></h2>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>, formerly ripple, also remained in the red on Wednesday, dropping to a multi-week low in the process.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>/USD bottomed out at $0.5918 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, which comes following Tuesday&#x2019;s high at $0.6275.</p>
<p>Similar to dogecoin above, today&#x2019;s drop in price saw <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> move to its lowest point since mid-July.</p>

<p>One of the catalysts for the sell-off was a breakout of a support point at the 40.00 mark on the RSI indicator.</p>
<p>The index is now tracking at 36.76, which is its weakest point since May, a point when the price was hovering around $0.4600.</p>
<p>Bulls will hope to reject further drops in price, however will first need to drop below an upcoming floor at the 32.00 zone.</p>

<h2>Binance Leads But Not Without Contenders, Says Coingecko&#8217;s Mid-Year Crypto Study</h2>
<p>According to the Coingecko <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/centralized-crypto-exchanges-market-share">research report</a>, Binance continues to dominate the centralized cryptocurrency exchange market with a 51.7% share, boasting a spot trading volume of $235.3 billion in June 2023. However, researchers noted a significant drop from its March peak of $559.8 billion, suggesting possible weaknesses.</p>
<p>The research spotlighted Upbit&#8217;s perseverance, holding firm as the second-largest exchange. Despite a dip to a 6% market share in May 2023, Upbit rebounded with an 8.1% share by June, backed by a $36.8 billion trading volume. Still, data shows the exchange experienced a 43.4% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) volume decrease.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-602803 size-full" title="2023 Centralized Crypto Exchange Study Highlights Winds of Change Among Top 10 Platforms" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/binannceer.jpg" alt="2023 Centralized Crypto Exchange Study Highlights Winds of Change Among Top 10 Platforms" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/binannceer-300x169.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/binannceer-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/binannceer-768x432.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/binannceer-190x107.jpg 190w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/binannceer-380x214.jpg 380w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/binannceer-760x428.jpg 760w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/binannceer.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>The report underscored the rise of Bybit and Bitget in the second quarter. Bybit, celebrating a 26.7% QoQ growth, clinched the fifth spot among centralized crypto exchanges. Meanwhile, Bitget made notable strides to secure the seventh position. Both exchanges notably dethroned industry stalwarts Crypto.com and Huobi. The analysis also highlighted Binance&#8217;s declining trajectory.</p>
<p>Between Q1 and Q2 2023, Binance&#8217;s trading volume plummeted by 52.4%, which translates to a $823.9 billion decrease. The report said this decline starkly contrasts with the combined $270.8 billion drop of its nine closest competitors, suggesting regulatory pressures might be denting its dominance. Beyond the big players, the Coingecko report paints a vivid picture of a fiercely contested market.</p>

<p>Okx, holding the third position with a 7% market share, is closely trailed by contenders like Coinbase, Bybit, and Kucoin. With each commanding less than 7% of the market, the battle among the top ten continues to be intense. The study leveraged data from the top ten exchanges by recording the centralized trading platforms’ spot trade volumes between January 1, 2023 and June 30, 2023.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) extended recent declines on Wednesday, as traders began to anticipate the upcoming FOMC minutes report.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD fell to an intraday low of $29,061.95 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, which comes after a high of $29,439.12 the day prior.</p>
<p>This drop sent bitcoin to its lowest point since August 7, when the price fell to a bottom of $28,660.</p>

<p>Wednesday&#x2019;s decline comes despite an upward crossover taking place between the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages.</p>
<p>The relative strength index (RSI) did provide a bearish signal however, slipping towards a floor of 42.00</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is tracking at 44.49, which is also a seven-day low.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Additionally, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) edged lower for a second straight session, as the cryptocurrency moved towards a floor of its own.</p>
<p>Following a high at $1,842.95 on Tuesday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD dropped to an intraday low of $1,816.33 earlier today.</p>
<p>Like with bitcoin above, this plunge saw the world&#x2019;s second largest cryptocurrency record a one-week low.</p>

<p>Whilst the RSI on <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> was heading towards a floor, ethereum&#x2019;s price strength broke out of its own support.</p>
<p>The index moved below a support level at 41.00, and is now tracking at 40.83, with the next visible point of support at 39.00.</p>
<p>Should this target be reached, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> will likely be trading around the $1,780 mark.</p>

The court, however, commuted Steynberg&#8217;s three-and-a-half-year sentence to a fine of just over $31,000. Both Steynberg&#8217;s lawyers and the prosecution team have reportedly appealed the court&#8217;s decision.</strong></p>
<h2>MTI Boss Avoids Jail Time</h2>
<p>A Brazilian court has reportedly found Johann Steynberg, the CEO of Mirror Trading International (MTI) — the defunct bitcoin ponzi scheme — guilty in a case in which he is accused of using forged identity documents. However, according to a Mybroadband <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/cryptocurrency/504222-boss-of-south-africas-biggest-pyramid-scheme-in-history-found-guilty-in-brazil-fined-r595000.html">report</a>, Steynberg, who was sentenced to three and a half years in prison, is unlikely to serve the jail time after the court reportedly ordered him to pay a fine instead.</p>
<p>As previously <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ceo-of-mirror-trading-international-bitcoin-ponzi-scheme-arrested-in-brazil/">reported</a> by Bitcoin.com News, Steynberg, who <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ceo-of-mti-bitcoin-ponzi-scheme-flees-south-africa-in-a-possible-exit-scam-funds-blocked/">fled</a> South Africa in late 2020, was arrested by Brazilian law enforcement in December 2021. At the time of his arrest, Steynberg was found to be in possession of a forged Brazilian identity document. Following his arrest, South African authorities reportedly kickstarted the process to have the MTI boss extradited.</p>
<p>Steynberg’s subsequent attempt to block the extradition proceedings was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brazilian-judge-dismisses-bitcoin-scam-masterminds-attempt-to-block-his-extradition-to-south-africa/">rebuffed</a> by a Brazilian judge in 2022. Since then, the MTI mastermind has seemingly remained in &#8220;precautionary detention.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>
<h2>Steynberg Appeals Against &#8216;Harsh&#8217; Sentence</h2>
<p>On why the Brazilian court commuted Steynberg’s jail sentence to a total fine of just over $31,100, the report cited the South American country’s penal code which states that jail terms of four years or lower for non-violent crimes can be converted to fines.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the report said Steynberg’s lawyers have signaled their intention to appeal the court’s decision. The lawyers have said Steynberg’s alleged offense warrants a less harsh sentence than the three and a half years handed down by the court. The prosecution team, which is also appealing the court&#8217;s verdict, suggested that the punishment given to Steynberg is not commensurate with the offense.</p>

Under the new rules, issuers that want their fiat-pegged tokens to be labeled as “MAS-regulated” will have to meet certain requirements. </strong></p>
<h2>Singapore to Require Stablecoin Issuers to Maintain Minimum Base Capital and Liquid Assets</h2>
<p>Singapore’s central banking institution has finalized its new regulatory framework for stablecoins issued in the country. On Tuesday, the monetary authority said its features seek to ensure a high degree of value stability for the stablecoins it will regulate.</p>
<p>MAS emphasized that feedback from the public consultation launched in October 2022 has been taken into account. “Stablecoins are digital payment tokens designed to maintain a constant value against one or more specified fiat currencies,” the regulator noted in a press release and elaborated:</p>
<blockquote><p>When well-regulated to preserve such value stability, stablecoins can serve as a trusted medium of exchange to support innovation, including the &#8216;on-chain&#8217; purchase and sale of digital assets.</p></blockquote>
<p>The financial authority also pointed out that the framework will apply to single-currency stablecoins (SCS) pegged to the Singapore dollar or any of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G10_currencies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">G10 currencies</a>, the world’s most traded fiat currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, the euro, the Japanese yen, and the Swiss franc.</p>
<p>SCS issuers will have to fulfill some key requirements in order to apply for and obtain a “MAS-regulated stablecoins” label for their digital currencies. These cover several important areas such as value stability, capital, and redemption.</p>

<p>Reserve assets for the stablecoins will be subject to requirements relating to their composition, valuation, custody and audit, to ensure value stability, the MAS explained. Issuers will be obliged to maintain minimum base capital and liquid assets to limit insolvency risks.</p>
<p>They must also return the par value of SCS to holders within five business days from a redemption request and appropriately disclose to users information about the implemented value stabilizing mechanism, the rights of stablecoin holders, as well as the results from audits of reserve assets.</p>
<p>This label will allow users to distinguish MAS-regulated stablecoins from other digital payment tokens, the central bank emphasized. Its Deputy Managing Director for Financial Supervision, Ho Hern Shin, urged issuers that want their stablecoins to be recognized as such to prepare early for compliance.</p>
<p>She also highlighted that the regulatory framework aims to facilitate the use of stablecoins as a “credible digital medium of exchange” and a bridge between the fiat and digital asset ecosystems. It’s being introduced over a year after the collapse of stablecoin terrausd and cryptocurrency luna issued by the Singapore-registered company Terraform Labs. The stablecoin rules also follow the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/singapore-implements-new-crypto-regulations-targeting-custody-lending-staking/">implementation</a> of new regulations for crypto service providers in July.</p>

Davidson explained that many people wrongly conflate cryptocurrencies with CBDC when these are two different concepts.</strong></p>
<h2>Congressman Warren Davidson: &#8216;CBDC Is Evil&#8217;</h2>
<p>Congressman Warren Davidson has warned about the dangers that issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) represents for the financial technology industry in America. Davidson vocally criticized the use of these tools, reaffirming his opposition to CBDC by <a href="https://twitter.com/WarrenDavidson/status/1691050354283048963?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stating</a> on social media that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At least most agree that CBDC is evil &#8211; the financial equivalent of the Death Star. Don’t become an accomplice to anyone designing, building, testing, developing, or establishing CBDC.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Davidson, part of the House Financial Services Committee, emphasized that many people wrongly conflated the concept of CBDC with Bitcoin and that banning the existence of a CBDC in America would be &#8220;essential&#8221; to America&#8217;s fintech future.</p>
<p>Davidson&#8217;s opposition to CBDC is not new, as the representative has railed against the concept before, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-representative-warren-davidson-cbdc-corrupts-money-into-a-tool-for-coercion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stating</a> that &#8220;central bank digital currency (CBDC) corrupts money into a tool for coercion &amp; control,&#8221; explaining that there was no way of implementing CBDCs in America without legislation.</p>

<h2>People, Not Tokens</h2>
<p>The congressman noted that the tech behind these tools was not the problem, as he pinned responsibility on the human resource behind CBDC projects. Davidson <a href="https://twitter.com/WarrenDavidson/status/1691050987014782976?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tokenized assets are not the problem. It’s the people. Entities (including the Federal Reserve, Ripple, Consensys) and influencers are actively working on CBDC projects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Davison concluded by <a href="https://twitter.com/WarrenDavidson/status/1691051791339638785?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcing</a> that he was working on passing a regulation that would &#8220;criminalize designing, building, testing, developing, or establishing a central bank digital currency.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the Federal Reserve is now openly <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/cbdc-faqs.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considering</a> a digital dollar as &#8220;a means to expand safe payment options, not to reduce or replace them,&#8221; it recognizes that it has taken &#8220;no decision on issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) and would only proceed with the issuance of a CBDC with an authorizing law.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several bills have been introduced to stop the hypothetical issuance of a digital dollar. In February, Representative Tom Emmer <a href="https://emmer.house.gov/2023/2/emmer-leads-effort-to-squash-financial-surveillance-state-initiatives" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced</a> the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act to &#8220;halt efforts of unelected bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. from issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) that strips Americans of their right to financial privacy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also, in March, Senator Ted Cruz <a href="https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-cruz-introduces-legislation-to-prohibit-the-fed-from-establishing-a-central-bank-digital-currency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced</a> a bill to stop the Federal Reserve from developing a CBDC.</p>

<h2>Little Green Monsters, Gurus, Cats, and Prediction Markets</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
After the May 15, 2023 <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cashtokens-take-center-stage-following-bitcoin-cash-upgrade-over-26000-tokens-created/">Bitcoin Cash upgrade</a>, which effectively <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-cash-smart-contracts-comparable-to-those-on-ethereum-possible-via-may-upgrade-1000x-efficiency-advantage-dev-jason-dreyzehner/">enables smart contracts onchain for BCH</a> by utilizing unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs), much development has been ongoing on the network surrounding Cashtokens, a feature that has inspired the creation of numerous non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and marketplaces like <a href="https://tapswap.cash/">tapswap.cash</a>.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a href="https://tapswap.cash/trade">NFT sales</a> and trading activity are still modest compared to other networks, with marketplaces in their nascent stages, and decentralized exchanges (dexs) in <a href="https://app.cauldron.quest/#/">test phases</a>. That notwithstanding, development has been occurring at an industrious pace in the background, as advocates of Cashtokens point to the power of the upgraded chain to enable even more types of <a href="https://www.bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf">permissionless peer-to-peer exchange directly onchain</a>, for lower fees than other leading protocols. Some NFT collections of note include <a href="https://tapswap.cash/trade/180f0db4465c2af5ef9363f46bacde732fa6ffb3bfe65844452078085b2e7c93">Emerald DAO</a>, <a href="https://tapswap.cash/trade/07275f68d14780c737279898e730cec3a7b189a761caf43b4197b60a7c891a97">Bitcats Heroes Club</a>, and <a href="https://tapswap.cash/trade/f54ce0297a4017cc922aacde5f7abe7a8397a1058b879f5eb9e2a643d4ec2301">BCH Gurus</a>.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As developer Jason Dreyzehner mentioned to Bitcoin.com News back in May: &#x201C;Suddenly it was possible to build very efficient, UTXO-based decentralized applications while preserving important features of Bitcoin Cash: stateless transaction validation (low fees) and zero-delay re-spending (fast transactions).&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Paytaca, creator of the Cashtokens-friendly Paytaca wallet, is now working on a tool to enable anyone to create their own NFTs via a project called Cashtokens Studio. CEO of Paytaca Joemar Taganna is also involved with the Bitcats Heroes Club NFTs. Taganna told Bitcoin.com news:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>There is a need now for a tool for the general public that will allow anyone to create tokens using the Cashtokens protocol. Currently, the process is largely manual, so it is tedious and error-prone. That&#x2019;s why we are building Cashtokens Studio.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#13;<br />
One popular NFT project springing up after the May upgrade has been the <a href="https://nfts.bch.guru/">BCH Gurus</a>. This project is a multi-dimensional NFT endeavor which is currently building price prediction games fueled by NFTs and other tokens on the new protocol.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />

&#x201C;The Cashtokens upgrade has allowed for an entirely new ecosystem to develop directly on Bitcoin Cash mainchain,&#x201D; the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a> Guru Team told Bitcoin.com News via Telegram, elaborating: &#x201C;The <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a> Guru combines the fun and addictive element of a uniquely designed NFT collection, along with a fungible token (Furu), allowing users to play price prediction games onchain through a Cashtokens smart contract.&#x201D;&#13;</p>

&#13;<br />
&#x201C;The <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a> community is becoming more vibrant and productive, a breath of fresh air from the prior years of political conflict leading to splits. We now have individuals, dev teams, and entrepreneurs, supported by well-aligned donors / investors, all working together to make the peer-to-peer cash revolution happen.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
