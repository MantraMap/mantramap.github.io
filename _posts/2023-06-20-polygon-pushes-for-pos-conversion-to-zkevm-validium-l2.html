<p>Polygon Labs engineering team has published a proposal to upgrade Polygon Proof-of-Stake (PoS) sidechain to &#8216;zkEVM Validium&#8217;, an Ethereum-secured Layer 2 network. Markedly, the zkEVM Validium protocol is a first-of-its-kind decentralized L2 secured by zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs. The upgrade is targeted towards keeping up with the future by aligning the current Polygon PoS with the <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="https://coingape.com/polygon-pushes-for-pos-conversion-to-zkevm-validium-l2/" title="Polygon Pushes for PoS Conversion to zkEVM Validium L2"></a></p>
