With over 119,000 holders, users appear keen on accumulating. In crypto circles, token holder count can be used to measure interest and adoption. Projects with a higher token holder count can be used to indicate strong community support, which can translate to success. It can also indicate the level of utility and adoption. Tokens like USDT, a stablecoin, have high token holder counts considering their role in decentralized finance (DeFi), remittance, and more.  In the case of PEPE, token holders are mostly speculating because the coin has no utility but is deflationary. An extract from their homepage reads:  PEPE is a meme coin with no intrinsic value or expectation of financial return. There is no formal team or roadmap. The coin is completely useless and for entertainment purposes only. PEPE is an ERC-20 token on Ethereum and can be bought on platforms like Binance, KuCoin, Uniswap, a decentralized exchange, and others. At the same time, the token’s derivatives have been listed on several cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance, which began supporting the token on its Innovation Zone while listing PEPE’s perpetual futures in early May 2023. Binance To Delist PEPE From Flexible Loan Program Following increasing regulatory scrutiny, Binance announced plans to delist PEPE as a borrowable asset from their Flexible Loan program.
