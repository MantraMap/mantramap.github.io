					<description><![CDATA[SpiritSwap, a decentralized exchange (DEX) on Fantom, will no longer be shutting down its operations in September after it received a takeover offer from Power, another Fantom-based DeFi protocol. The proposed shutdown was a result of cross-chain protocol Multichain’s collapse, which had a significant impact on the Fantom ecosystem. On August 9, SpiritSwap announced on Discord that it is “winding down” operations and is looking for a team to take over the project after its treasury was drained in the Multichain exploit. The protocol initially planned to shut down by September 1, 2023, but it appears that won&#8217;t be happening anymore after Power’s intervention. This would come as a relief to several SpiritSwap community members, especially those who have the native token SPIRIT locked on the protocol. According to the protocol’s website, there are currently over 410 million SPIRIT tokens locked. Power To Deposit 200,000 USDC Into The SpiritiSwap Treasury On August 16, the SpiritSwap community approved the proposal to hand the keys of the protocol to Power, a non-fungible token platform on Fantom. Power has now proposed to deposit 200,000 USDC into the SpiritSwap treasury. Related Reading: Stellar Breaks Free: Unleashes New Open-Source Disbursement Platform The team behind the NFT platform stated in the proposal that the deployment of these funds into the treasury is the first phase of ensuring that SpiritSwap survives. Meanwhile, Power claims to hold more than $1 million in liquid assets across multiple chains “ready to mobilize for use”. In the proposal, the Power team clarified that it has also been developing its own decentralized exchange, PowerSwap. Then, it laid out plans to integrate some designs of the new DEX into SpiritSwap. It is worth mentioning that Power was also impacted by the Multichain exploit. Fortunately, the protocol’s treasury assets were not bridged to Multichain, leading to relatively small losses. Multichain Exploit &#8211; The Impact On Fantom The Fantom ecosystem was the biggest victim in the Multichain exploit in July, which resulted in a total loss of over $126 million. The attack seemed to have specifically targeted the protocol’s Fantom bridge, causing a drain of more than $120 million worth of assets. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Takes a Bit Hit: Main Reasons $1,720 or $1,650 Are Likely Targets As inferred earlier, the ripple effect of the Multichain hack spread across various projects on the Fantom blockchain. As a result, the total value locked (TVL) on the network has been on a steady decline.  Fantom has seen its TVL drop by more than 61% since July 6 &#8211; the day of the Multichain exploit. As of this writing, the total value locked on the network stands at about $86.2 million, according to data from DefiLlama.

					<description><![CDATA[Shibarium, an Ethereum layer 2 solution, can be termed one of the most-hyped crypto projects of 2023, expected to introduce a higher network speed and lower transaction costs to the Shiba Inu ecosystem. After months of beta testing, Shiba Inu developers finally announced on August 16 that the Shibariun mainnet is now live. However, contrary to popular predictions, SHIB, Shiba Inu’s most prominent token, appears to have taken a nosedive upon this development.  SHIB Maintains Bearish Form As Shibarium’s Ethereum Bridge Develops Fault So far, Shibarium’s launch has yielded a negative effect on SHIB, with the token losing 6.86% of its value in the last 24 hours based on data from CoinMarketCap. Prior to SHIB’s dip today, the token had shown an overall negative performance this week, falling from $0.00001059 on Monday to $0.000009527 on Wednesday.  Related Reading: Shiba Inu Keeps Energy Alive, Snags 26% Gain – Here’s The Inside Scoop For now, SHIB&#8217;s loss post-Shibarium launch can be attributed to a technical issue with the much-anticipated project. According to a post by Whalechart on X, more than $1.7 million worth of ETH is presently stuck in the Shibarium bridge. This development has caused much panic among investors.  In addition, it seems these assets may be unretrievable following a message being circulated on social media that appears to be from Shiba Inu developer Shytoshi Kusama. Meanwhile, it is worth stating SHIB is not the only Shiba Inu token under significant selling pressure, with the BONE and LEASH also declining by 15.48% and 22.59%, respectively, over the last day. Could Shibarium Be A Set Back To The Shiba Inu Ecosystem?  Shibarium was designed to enable the various projects of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, such as the Shib Metaverse, Shibaswap DEX, and the Shiboshi NFT Project, to operate at an increased speed while offering users lesser transaction costs. Furthermore, all Shibarium transactions are to lead to SHIB burn, thus serving as a deflationary mechanism of the token. Due to these proposed features of the Shibarium project, it was widely expected that the layer 2 solution could bring about a higher adoption of SHIB and other Shiba Inu native tokens which in turn could boost market prices.  There were many positive signs backing this prediction, with the SHIB token notching significant gains upon any news on the progress of Shibarium in the last few months.  Related Reading: More Selling? Bankrupt Voyager Sends Millions In SHIB And ETH To Coinbase In fact, Shibarium launched on Wednesday with 21 million wallets created, demonstrating a high level of user interest. However, the recent issue with the Ethereum bridge provides much concern for Shiba Inu investors on if the Shibarium project can live up to its potential. Nevertheless, it may still be considered too early to call the project a failure, especially as there is no official statement from the Shiba Inu team addressing this challenge.   At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.000009295, with a 0.37% gain in the last hour. Meanwhile, the token’s daily trading volume is down by 0.42%, sitting at $431.32 million.

					<description><![CDATA[Blockchain-based payment network Stellar has introduced the open-source “Stellar Disbursement Platform,” aimed at facilitating faster, cost-effective, and transparent digital disbursements worldwide.  Developed by the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) over the past year, the platform enables individuals and organizations to execute bulk disbursements using digital assets for various purposes, including gig worker payments and digital aid delivery.  Initially deployed for digital aid disbursements in Ukraine, the turnkey payment solution is now open-source and available for use and further development by anyone. Revolutionizing Global Payments? According to the announcement made on Wednesday, the Stellar Disbursement Platform allows users to send funds to thousands of recipients swiftly within seconds.  It offers numerous applications, including supplier payments, payroll management, and contractor payments, catering to diverse payment needs.  Furthermore, the platform&#8217;s seamless integration with Stellar&#8217;s global network of on and off-ramps, covering over 180 countries, provides recipients with the convenience of converting digital currency to cash &#8220;easily.&#8221; Related Reading: Another Crypto Millionaire Has Been Found Dead Denelle Dixon, CEO of the Stellar Foundation, expressed enthusiasm for the open-source release of the Stellar Disbursement Platform. She highlighted its success in facilitating digital aid disbursements in Ukraine and its subsequent evolution into a comprehensive payment solution.  Dixon emphasized the platform&#8217;s potential to empower gig workers, global payroll systems, and creators, fostering a more inclusive and accessible financial future. Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, also acknowledged the impact of the Stellar Disbursement Platform on humanitarian aid disbursements. He praised the platform&#8217;s effectiveness in utilizing the USD Coin (USDC) and highlighted its potential to advance global disbursement practices.  The open-source nature of the Stellar Disbursement Platform reflects a commitment to collaboration within the blockchain community. By sharing this tool with the world, Stellar aims to create a more accessible and transparent financial future, benefiting gig workers, global payroll systems, and creators. Overall, Stellar&#8217;s launch of the open-source Stellar Disbursement Platform marks a significant step towards enabling faster, cost-effective, and transparent digital disbursements worldwide. The platform enables individuals and organizations to streamline their payment processes with its wide range of applications and integration with Stellar&#8217;s network.  Stellar Secures Minority Stake In MoneyGram On Tuesday, the Stellar Development Foundation announced its recent participation in the go-private transaction with Madison Dearborn Partners (MDP), solidifying its position as a minority investor in MoneyGram, providing cross-border P2P (person-to-person) payments and money transfer services. As part of this investment, SDF has secured a seat on MoneyGram&#8217;s Board of Directors, granting the foundation an opportunity to contribute to MoneyGram&#8217;s future and digital strategy actively. Per the announcement, joining a group of leaders from the payments, financial services, and technology sectors, SDF&#8217;s presence on the board will leverage its collective expertise to fortify and guide MoneyGram&#8217;s digital transformation. Furthermore, the investment positions SDF to play a vital role in various aspects of MoneyGram&#8217;s journey, including the expansion of its digital business, exploration of blockchain technology, and support for the company&#8217;s overarching mission of facilitating secure and efficient global money movement for individuals and businesses across multiple countries.

					<description><![CDATA[The Bitcoin price action has been stuck in a tight range for weeks leading to the lowest volatility levels in years. A recent report hints at a potential breakout from the current range, but which side will be favorable by the potential spike in volatility? Related Reading: Bitcoin Speculators Retreat As Long-Term Holders Double Down Since $69,000 Peak As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $28,950 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. Over the previous seven days, the BTC’s price saw a slight downtick recording a 2% loss. Other tokens in the top 10 by market cap are underperforming, with many seeing double-digit losses on low timeframes. The Last Time The Bitcoin Price Saw Low Volatility As seen in the chart below, provided by trading desk QCP Capital in a report, annualized volatility for BTC reached critical levels seen for the first time in over five years. The metric last stood at these levels from late 2018 to 2019. The chart above also shows that volatility fluctuated from the low to the yearly high in a cycle that extended for 2019. At that time, Bitcoin and the crypto market were coming out from a prolonged bear market that, as today, left traders and market participants in shambles and with almost no appetite for risk. QCP Capital noted that from 2018 to 2019, the macroeconomic landscape dominated the Bitcoin price action. At that time, the US Federal Reserve (Fed) hiked interest rates, but the COVID-19 pandemic, which operated as a catalyzer, forced it to reverse. The latter occurred from late 2019 to 2020, when the ease in macroeconomic conditions allowed Bitcoin to soar to a new all-time high. Thus, the trading desk believes that a catalyzer is needed to push the price action back to life: The last time trading was this compressed, it was during the crypto winter of 2018 and 2019, and it took a change in the macro environment to revive the market again. However, they noted that the break of the current low volatility environment is not “imminent.” However, the upcoming decision on a Bitcoin spot Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) in the US could operate as a catalyzer, bringing BTC to its next resistance level at around $34,000, but patience is still required. Related Reading: Bitcoin &#38; Top Assets See High Loss Taking, Is This Bullish? QCP Capital concluded: Will there be a sharp rally that takes us to the 34k resistance – like the prior three times which kissed the support trendline this year? We think it could still be another quiet few weeks before we find out. Cover image from Unsplash, chart from Tradingview]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Asset management firm Valkyrie has taken a significant step by filing for an Ether or Ethereum (ETH) futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) called “Valkyrie Ethereum Strategy ETF” with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Valkyrie Ether Futures ETF Include Secure Collateral Investments According to the filed documents on August 16, the proposed ETF will not directly invest in Ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain. Instead, it aims to acquire a portfolio of Ether futures contracts.  These contracts are traded on commodity exchanges registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), primarily focusing on contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).  The value of these futures contracts will be determined by the CME CF Ether Reference Rate, which tracks the price of Ether across selected cash exchanges. Related Reading: Bitcoin &#38; Top Assets See High Loss Taking, Is This Bullish? Per the filing, the Fund intends to employ a &#8220;rolling&#8221; strategy to manage the expiration of futures contracts. As contracts approach their expiration date, they will be replaced by similar contracts with later expiration dates.  These contracts allow investors to speculate on Ether&#8217;s future price movements without owning the digital asset directly.  Apart from Ether futures contracts, the Fund will invest its remaining assets in cash, cash-like instruments, or high-quality securities, collectively called &#8220;Collateral Investments.&#8221;  These may include U.S. Government securities, money market funds, and corporate debt securities rated investment grade or comparable quality. Collateral Investments serve the purpose of providing liquidity and satisfying margin requirements for the Fund&#8217;s futures portfolio.  In addition, the Fund may engage in reverse repurchase agreements to help maintain the desired level of exposure to Ether futures contracts. These factors are expected to position the proposed Ether ETF favorably with the SEC, as it aligns with their requirements. Therefore, there is optimism for a promising decision in support of the Ether ETF application. Options Market Supports BTC And ETH Amid Strong US Economy The strength of the US economy has propelled the US Dollar Index (DXY) to deliver a sharp performance, exerting continued pressure on the cryptocurrency market. However, despite liquidity challenges, the gradual decline in Bitcoin (BTC) and ETH prices has not exceeded expectations.  Fortunately, the options market continues providing substantial price support for BTC and ETH, ensuring stability without external liquidity. Digital asset management platform Blofin has closely analyzed the options market and identified significant factors contributing to the ongoing support for BTC and ETH.  Positive gamma has impacted BTC, &#8220;sticking&#8221; its price around the $29,000 mark. Similarly, for ETH, market makers&#8217; hedging behavior around the $1,800 strike price has also provided support, preventing a steeper decline in its price. Despite the overall support from the options market, Blofin&#8217;s analysis reveals a discrepancy in the sentiment of block traders towards BTC and ETH.  Related Reading: Shiba Inu DAO Gets Serious With New Advisory And Investment Firm Block traders, who typically execute large-volume trades, believe more strongly in BTC&#8217;s resilience than ETH. This preference may stem from BTC&#8217;s established position as the leading cryptocurrency and its reputation as a reliable store of value. Overall, Blofin&#8217;s analysis underscores the crucial role the options market plays in supporting BTC and ETH amid liquidity pressures. The positive gamma effect and market makers&#8217; hedging actions have contributed to maintaining the stability of both cryptocurrencies. As of the time of writing, the second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of trading volume is trading at $1,825. Following in the footsteps of Bitcoin, Ethereum has experienced a 0.8% decline over the past 24 hours, further extending its downward trend over the past 30 days, resulting in a 4% decline during that period.

					<description><![CDATA[The Ethereum price has been on a rather disappointing run for investors over the last month and this decline has seen it fall to the low $1,800s. As the onslaught continues, the question now is will Ethereum be able to cross the $2,000 resistance before the month runs out? ETH Open Interest On The Rise One interesting factor about the current trend for the digital asset is the rate at which open interest is growing. Now, during times of falling prices where long traders are suffering the most in the market, open interest tends to decline as traders start to pull back from bullish positions. However, that has not been the case lately. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Price Crash Similarly To 2019 And 2020? As data from Coinglass shows, the Ethereum open interest has been on the rise lately. This growth trend is evident across exchanges, a number of which saw a significant jump in their Ethereum open interest. For example, in the last day, the ETH open interest rose 16.77% on CoinEx, 14.48% on OKX, and 13.08% on Bitget. It doesn’t end there as the likes of Huobi and Binance also saw an 8.15% and 5.94% increase in their ETH open interest, respectively. ETH open interest on exchanges jumps 5.98% in 24 hours &#124; Source: Coinglass As a result of this, the total exchange ETH futures open interest in USD moved from $6 billion last week to $6.54 billion on Wednesday. Given that the ETH futures open interest across exchanges was sitting at $6.4 billion on Tuesday, it translates to a 5.98% jump in total open interest in the last 24 hours alone. What Does This Mean For Ethereum Price? The steady rise in the Ethereum futures open interest on exchanges could point to a coming halt in the price decline. This is because, despite the falling prices, investors expect the price of the cryptocurrency to keep rising, which means bullish sentiment has not waned. What the current trend points to is likely a case of investors selling off holdings to secure some profit. But with so much open interest, it means there is not a lot of runway for the sellers. As a result, they will run out of steam soon and buyers will take over the market once more. Related Reading: Base TVL Surges 900% In 2 Weeks, What’s Driving The Growth? When this happens, it would not take long until the Ethereum price is back up once more. Pulling above $2,000 will be more of a hurdle though. This is because the price of ETH continues to trade below its 50-day moving average, giving bears steam for the resistance at $2,000. ETH bulls hold $1,800 support amid decline &#124; Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com However, with the expectations of an Ethereum ETF being approved by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), there could be more volume flowing into the asset soon. This could be just the push ETH’s price would need to break $2,000. But the first ETH ETF deliberation by the SEC will happen in October, crossing August out of the picture.

					<description><![CDATA[In a recent interview, Tom Lee, CNBC’s head of research, shared his insights on the potential impact of a Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on the price of the largest cryptocurrency in the market.  Lee expressed optimism that introducing a Bitcoin ETF could propel the digital asset to price levels of $150,000 or even $180,000, representing a significant surge from current levels.  Optimistic View On BTC Lee&#8217;s bullish stance on the potential for a Bitcoin ETF to drive price appreciation reflects the growing anticipation within the cryptocurrency community, as an ETF would provide traditional investors with a regulated and easily accessible vehicle for gaining exposure to Bitcoin, potentially attracting substantial capital inflows into the market.  According to Lee, if the SEC were to approve a Spot Bitcoin ETF, it could unlock a new wave of investor interest and significantly boost the price of Bitcoin.  He estimated that this approval could drive the cryptocurrency to $150,000 or even $180,000, representing a substantial appreciation from its current levels.  The endorsement of a regulated ETF would likely instill confidence among institutional investors who have hesitated to enter the cryptocurrency market due to concerns about custody and regulatory oversight.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a recent <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinNews2905/status/1691803938889072862?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">interview</a>, Tom Lee, CNBC’s head of research, shared his insights on the potential impact of a Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on the price of the largest cryptocurrency in the market. </p>
<p>Lee expressed optimism that introducing a Bitcoin ETF could propel the digital asset to price levels of $150,000 or even $180,000, representing a significant surge from current levels. </p>
<h2>Optimistic View On BTC</h2>
<p>Lee&#8217;s bullish stance on the potential for a Bitcoin ETF to drive price appreciation reflects the growing anticipation within the cryptocurrency community, as an ETF would provide traditional investors with a regulated and easily accessible vehicle for gaining exposure to Bitcoin, potentially attracting substantial capital inflows into the market. </p>
<p>According to Lee, if the SEC were to approve a Spot Bitcoin ETF, it could unlock a new wave of investor interest and significantly boost the price of Bitcoin. </p>
<p>He estimated that this approval could drive the cryptocurrency to $150,000 or even $180,000, representing a substantial appreciation from its current levels. </p>
<p>The endorsement of a regulated ETF would likely instill confidence among institutional investors who have hesitated to enter the cryptocurrency market due to concerns about custody and regulatory oversight.</p>

<p>However, Lee also acknowledged the influence of the upcoming Bitcoin halving event on the price trajectory. Bitcoin&#8217;s protocol is designed to undergo halvings approximately every four years, reducing the block reward miners receive by half. </p>
