<p>Tether issued its 2023 Second Quarter attestation report, revealing a net profit of $850M and over $1B of operational profits.&nbsp;</p>
Tether Excess Reserves Reach $3.3B Despite a Dip in the Quarterly Net Profit
<p>On Monday, July 31, the top stablecoin issuer Tether Holdings Limited issued its new quarterly attestation report. The assurance opinion for Q2 of 2023 was completed by BDO, a global independent accounting firm. The attestation re-affirms the accuracy of Tether&rsquo;s Consolidated Reserves Report (CRR), providing a detailed breakdown of the Group's assets as of June 30, 2023.</p>
<p>According to the report, a surplus of $850 million in net profit brought the company&rsquo;s total excess reserves to the all-time-high of $3.3 billion at the end of Q2. However, the increase itself is almost twice lower compared to the previous quarter&rsquo;s net profit which was reported to be around $1.5 billion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tether reminded that its excess reserves are the company&rsquo;s own profits and not distributed to shareholders. These reserves are kept in addition to the 100% reserves that &ldquo;Tether maintains to back all the outstanding tokens&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It was also revealed that during the period of April 2023 to June 2023, Tether&rsquo;s operational profits exceeded $1B, showing once again a 30% growth. Meanwhile, the company's share buyback amounted to 115M USD, the sum aimed at strengthening the shareholder group. As for Tether&rsquo;s reserves, they continue to be extremely liquid, with around 85% of investments held in cash or cash equivalents.</p>
<p>Both Tether&rsquo;s CRR and the BDO attestation confirm that Tether&rsquo;s consolidated assets once more surpass its consolidated liabilities. The Management of the Company reported that as of June 30, 2023:</p>
<ul>

USDT Market Cap Approaches $84B Mark, Its New ATH
<p>Tether&rsquo;s USDT remains to be the top stablecoin on the crypto market. According to CoinMarketCap, USDT is now the third largest coin by market capitalization, following Bitcoin and Ethereum. </p>
<p>This month, USDT&rsquo;s market cap reached the new high of $84 billion which the coin last approached in May of 2022. It is a large increase since the beginning of the year when the coin&rsquo;s market cap number stood at only $66 billion.</p>

<p>Paolo Ardoino, CTO of Tether, commented on the attestation report, &ldquo;Transparency is not just a buzzword for us; it is the cornerstone of our philosophy&hellip; With a firm focus on transparency, we aim to shape a future where every participant in the global financial ecosystem can confidently navigate a realm built on trust and innovation. That&rsquo;s why in this quarter, Tether&rsquo;s USDâ‚® token in circulation surpassed its previous all-time high."</p>
