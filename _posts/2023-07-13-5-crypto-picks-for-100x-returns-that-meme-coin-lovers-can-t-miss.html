<p class="s5">Meme coins have a robust reputation for their potential to deliver huge returns on investment over a short period of time. Meme coin lovers are attracted by projects that could experience exponential growth, leading to high returns overnight. However, finding the right projects is not such an easy task, especially as more and more coins appear on the market each day.</p>
<p class="s5">To help you out, we&rsquo;ve done the research on your behalf and we discovered the best altcoins to buy with huge potential for growth in the next period. Here are the 5 crypto picks for 100x returns that currently generate hype and attention within the community: DigiToads (TOADS), Floki Inu (FLOKI), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Monacoin (MONA).</p>
<p>DigiToads</p>
<p class="s5">DigiToads is one of the few presales this year that have generated huge buzz in the media. However, TOADS is more than a simple meme coin. In fact, this coin departs from the purely speculative business model and puts forward a robust ecosystem with plenty of opportunities to generate returns both actively and passively.</p>
<p class="s5">DigiToads combines a play-to-earn gaming universe with a stake-to-earn rare feature. These core elements attract gaming enthusiasts, who get to play with digital toads in an immersive world to earn TOADS in gaming competitions, but also long-term investors, who can buy TOADS and use them to purchase and stake trending NFTs in return for regular passive income.</p>
<p class="s5">Perhaps another crucial aspect is the deflationary nature of the TOADS ERC20 coins. This leads to the scarcity effect, unlike other inflationary coins, which means that TOADS holders do not only stand to benefit from value appreciation but also enjoy the potential for long-term passive returns.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="s11">FLOKI</p>
<p class="s5">FLOKI started out as a joke coin, but the dev team decided to expand into key areas like decentralized finance, NFTs, and the Metaverse. Despite being relatively new, just like TOADS, FLOKI is expected by experts to deliver significant growth and success in the next year.</p>
<p class="s5">The crypto project differentiates itself from other meme coins. Just like TOADS, it focuses on real-life use cases, which are expected to keep generating demand for the token.</p>
<p class="s11">Shiba Inu</p>
<p class="s5">Shiba Inu has been at the top of the list for quite some time now. Despite some bumps down the road this year, SHIB is still expected to live up to its reputation. The purpose of SHIB is to become one of the main decentralized cryptocurrencies that focus on a fun community of users.</p>
<p class="s11">Dogecoin </p>
<p class="s5">Dogecoin&rsquo;s cultural appeal has remained unaltered thanks to its lighthearted origin. Just like SHIB, a key driver for growth for this meme coin is the internet meme that has created a strong community. Also, DOGE has enjoyed multiple celebrity endorsements, with figures prominent in business, entertainment, and crypto industries offering attention to this meme coin.</p>
<p class="s11">Monacoin</p>
<p class="s5">Monacoin first appeared in Japan and garnered attention after appearing on a Japanese TV network, where land was purchased using MONA. Monacoin is essentially a payment network that facilitates P2P transactions.</p>
<p class="s5">One of the earliest meme coins, Monacoin enjoys a huge appeal, particularly in the Japanese crypto community. In addition to this, while some meme coins lack utility, MONA is used for multiple purposes, including tipping, donations, or as a means of exchange.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="s11">Summary</p>
<p class="s5">The rise of meme coins has taken many by surprise. Among the top contenders, DigiToadsstands out for its unique approach that combines play-to-earn gaming and a stake-to-earn mechanism with multiple community contests and awards.</p>
<p class="s5">As the meme coin landscape evolves, investors and traders are becoming more discerning than ever. The meme coin market offers huge potential for excitement, adrenaline, and gains, but it&rsquo;s important to focus on projects like DigiToads with robust growth potential and a solid foundation.</p>
