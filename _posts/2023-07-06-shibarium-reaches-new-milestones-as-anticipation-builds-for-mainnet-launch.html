The Shiba Inu community continues to mark new milestones with its testnet, Shibarium, as a steady surge of users links their crypto wallets to the network. Shibarium&#8217;s testnet, also known as Puppynet, launched on March 11 and has seen an increase in overall transaction count over the past 24 hours. Shibarium added almost a million transactions in a single day, catapulting past the 27 million mark and setting a new record. On June 13, a peak of 324,000 transactions was recorded, after which it slightly decreased over the following days. However, since June 19, the daily transactions have hovered around the 274,000 mark. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Records Surge In Daily New Addresses In Q2: A Sign Of Growing Interest? Consistent Growth In Wallet Links And Blocks Alongside transaction growth, the number of wallets linked to Shibarium continues to rise, albeit slower, according to Puppyscan data. The current count of linked wallets is over 17 million, with no substantial spikes recorded recently. The total blocks have increased to surpass 1.56 million, and the time required to create a new block has been reduced to 8.3 seconds. Notably, the community anticipates the official launch of Shibarium&#8217;s mainnet, with excitement fueled by a statement from the lead developer of Shiba Inu and Shibarium, the elusive Shytoshi Kusama. The developer informed the SHIB army about the planned &#8220;launch strategy&#8221; for Shibarium, noting that the date and time have been confirmed. The community speculates that the Shibarium mainnet could be launched between August 13 and 16 in Toronto, Canada, during the annual ETHToronto event. This event celebrates the creation of Ethereum, and given SHIB&#8217;s original launch on this blockchain, the community believes it would serve as a fitting tribute to Ethereum and its founder, Vitalik Buterin. Awaiting The Launch Of Shibarium Mainnet Kusama recently dropped a hint in a Telegram channel solely for Shibarium discussions, possibly confirming the theory regarding the mainnet&#8217;s launch date and location. Before this, he disclosed that Shiba Inu was &#8220;going somewhere&#8221; and clarified that this location would be outside the United States.
