<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/flare-ankr-rpc-infrastructure/">Flare Network and Ankr Partner to Boost Developer Productivity with High-Performance RPC Infrastructure</a></p>
<p>On July 7, <a href="https://flare.network" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Flare Network</a>, an EVM-based smart contract platform designed for secure data acquisition and interoperability, announced its strategic partnership with <a href="https://www.ankr.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Ankr</a>, a prominent cloud infrastructure provider in the Web3 field, to enhance its set of Remote Procedure Call (RPC) procedures aimed at developers.</p>
<p>Thanks to this partnership, developers working on Flare will have access to high-performance premium RPC services to streamline node operations and accelerate the development of decentralized applications (dApps).</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to Flare&#8217;s statement, developers will also benefit from Ankr&#8217;s advanced APIs, which include custom indexing to facilitate on-chain data queries, such as non-fungible token (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFT</a>) metadata.</p>
<h2>Meet Flare: Developer-Optimized Web3 Platform</h2>
<p>Flare is an off-chain decentralized data acquisition platform with built-in oracles in its network structure, aiming to improve developer productivity by providing a simple and consistent stack for decentralized interoperability.</p>
<p>Moreover, being compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which offers various possibilities for executing operations, any Solidity-programmed decentralized application can run on the Flare platform, securely leveraging its multiple advantages.</p>
<p>Hugo Philion, CEO and co-founder of Flare, stated that the partnership with Ankr will grant developers access to premium RPC tools from one of the leading blockchain companies in the industry, which has demonstrated its commitment to providing a reliable platform for building and monitoring both dApps and their services.</p>
<p>&#8220;Flare&#8217;s partnership with Ankr means that developers have access to premium RPC tools from the industry-leading node provider, along with the API Portal and Google Cloud infrastructure. This partnership highlights Flare&#8217;s commitment to providing developers with a flexible, robust, and reliable stack for building and monitoring their dApps and services while maintaining enterprise-level availability and security.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Ankr Aims to Contribute to a Safer and Interconnected Web3 Blockchain Ecosystem</h2>
<p>Additionally, Ankr, the cloud infrastructure provider designed to offer RPC services to multiple blockchains through its extensive network of geographically distributed nodes, will help Flare developers have a smoother working experience thanks to its fast response times and low latency.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitmex-arthur-hayes-bitcoin-ai/">BitMex Co-founder Arthur Hayes Says Bitcoin Could Rally Hard as AI Currency</a></p>
<p>The growth and adoption of Bitcoin (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC</a>) in the past few years is undeniably an excruciating pain to the bankers losing customers on a daily basis. Big investment fund managers led by <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/blackrock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlackRock Inc</a> (NYSE: BLK) have triggered a new phase of mainstream crypto adoption after its CEO Larry Fink referred to Bitcoin as digital gold. Valued at about half a trillion, the Bitcoin market continued to revolutionize the global financial markets with more than 420 million people around the world already using crypto.</p>
<p>However, there is a new tech sector that has challenged the crypto market in the recent past dubbed Artificial Intelligence (AI). The hype of AI has seen all related companies receive tremendous cash from investors, to an extent some experts believe they may only use a small portion.</p>
<p>For instance, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/nvidia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nvidia Corporation</a> (NASDAQ: NVDA) has seen its stock market rally nearly 200 percent YTD to trade around $429 on Friday with a market cap of about $1.05 trillion following the AI hype in the past few months. However, the company has a limit to the semiconductor it can deliver, more so after China recently put in place a limitation of exporting galium and other metals used in manufacturing chips.</p>
<h2>Hayes Spots Bitcoin Position in AI Mania</h2>
<p>According to former banker and BitMex co-founder <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/arthur-hayes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arthur Hayes</a>, Bitcoin has a very high chance of becoming the ultimate currency of artificial intelligence. According to the crypto enthusiast, if Bitcoin is adopted as an AI currency, the underlying price could outrightly rally to the moon. Moreover, the ongoing global inflation as the government prints money to pay off debts and people fleeing fiat money to digital assets will cause a significant imbalance in demand and supply.</p>
<p>“If Bitcoin is seen as likely to be – or even starts to be – used by AIs, then we could see two separate manias combine into one mega mania: the mania of wanting to escape inflation within the fiat financial system, and the mania of wanting to own a piece of the next phase of human + computer evolution. The overlap of these two manias would likely drive investors to grossly overpay for growth, causing the value of the Bitcoin network to rise to silly levels,” Hayes <a href="https://cryptohayes.substack.com/p/massa" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">noted</a>.</p>
<p>Having computed the mathematical implications of the AI economy adopting Bitcoin, Hayes believes the top coin will rally significantly between 2025 and 2026. In this regard, Hayes concluded that Bitcoin has a high chance of trading above $760k during the next major breakout.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, crypto enthusiasts believe now is the best time to enter the Bitcoin market for maximum profit during the AI &#8211; blockchain hype.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/cz-executive-departure-binance/">CZ Debunks FUD Surrounding Departure of Executives from Binance</a></p>
<p>The recent departure of several top executives from leading cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> has sparked reactions amongst netizens who described the action as a “full-on turmoil”.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/changpeng-zhao/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao</a>, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the exchange has debunked the narrative, claiming that it is just an attempt for media houses to generate and spread Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) in the industry.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">4. More FUD about some departures. Yes, there is turnover (at every company). But the reasons dreamed up by the “news” are completely wrong.</p>
<p>As an organization that has grown from 30 to 8000 people in 6 years, from 0 to the world’s largest crypto exchange in less than 5 months…</p>
<p>— CZ 🔶 Binance (@cz_binance) <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1677092535871602691?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 6, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In a Twitter post published earlier today, CZ said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“More FUD about some departures. Yes, there is turnover (at every company). But the reasons dreamed up by the &#8216;news&#8217; are completely wrong.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Explaining further, he highlighted that the departure was all part of the company&#8217;s required turnover of staff. Additionally, he mentioned that all three executives did not leave in one week as was earlier speculated. Zhao pointed out that it was merely an exaggeration as only one of these executives left this week.</p>
<p>&#8220;As markets and the global environment for crypto changes, as our organization evolves, and as personal situations change, there is turnover at every company. We thank all of our ex-team members for their contributions to our growth and wish them all the best. We also congratulate our team members who have grown into these new roles. They are all truly high caliber,&#8221; Binance CEO tweeted.</p>
<p>A report from Fortune stated that General Counsel Hon Ng, Chief Strategy Officer Patrick Hillmann, and Senior Vice President of Compliance Steven Christie left their respective positions in the leading exchange. Bloomberg also announced that Yibo Ling, Binance&#8217;s Chief Business Officer, has left the company.</p>
<p>The news reports cite CZ&#8217;s handling of ongoing investigations as the reason behind the sudden departure of the said executives. Also, Fortune described the decision of the executives as “a management and strategic crisis for Binance at a time when it is navigating immense regulatory pressure”.</p>
<h2>Former Binance Executives Confirm CZ&#8217;s Claim</h2>
<p>Noteworthy, Hillmann <a href="https://twitter.com/PRHillmann/status/1677070523740884992" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">confirmed</a> that he is leaving Binance but on good terms, adding that his wife is having a baby and as such is the right time for him to step aside.</p>
<p>Christie also <a href="https://twitter.com/SKChristie9/status/1677116795499712512" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">declared</a> that his reason for leaving is quite different from what was reported. He cited health and family reasons as the drive behind his departure from Binance.</p>
<p>“I have been in crypto compliance since 2015 when I joined Xapo, spending the last ~6 years straight leading and growing the Compliance functions at Kraken and Binance without a break. At this point, I am simply tired,” Christie said.</p>
<p>As it is, Binance is already faced with a lot of pressure from United States regulators who are questioning its integrity and offerings. Apart from the investigation initiated by the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>) <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/sec-binance-matic-sol-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued</a> Binance one month ago for listing unregistered securities, commingling customers&#8217; deposits, and flouting Know-Your-Customers (KYC) rules.</p>
<p>The market share of the exchange’s US subsidiary Binance.US is not doing so well, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-us-market-share-plummets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">losing</a> more than 20% of its market share as of Thursday, July 6. So far, the impact of the supposed FUD is yet to be published.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/chatgpt-traffic-drops-june/">ChatGPT Traffic Drops 10% in June as User Rush Subsides</a></p>
<p>ChatGPT, the worldwide popular artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot, witnessed a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/chatgpt-sees-traffic-fall-10-in-june-after-initial-rush-from-users" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">drop</a> in traffic for the month of June. This is the first month of traffic drop seen by ChatGPT ever since its launch to the public back in November 2022.</p>
<p>Compared to the previous month of May 2022, the traffic for ChatGPT dropped by 10% during the month of June, as per the traffic analytics site Similarweb. This includes the combined drop on both &#8211; desktop and mobile.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the number of people visiting the website and the time they spend on it have also decreased. The website&#8217;s unique visitors have gone down by 5.7%, and users are spending 8.5% less time on the site. In the United States, there has been a significant 10.3% decrease in monthly traffic to the website.</p>
<p>However, even with the decline in traffic, the website is still performing better than other competitors like Google&#8217;s Bard, Microsoft&#8217;s Bing, and a similar chatbot called Character AI. Despite the challenges, ChatGPT still remains the popular choice among investors.</p>
<p>According to David F. Carr, senior insights manager at Similarweb, the decline in interest in ChatGPT suggests that people are becoming less interested in AI chat and the initial excitement has faded away. Carr emphasized that chatbots will now need to demonstrate their value instead of being assumed as valuable.</p>
<p>There is speculation that the decline in website usage could be attributed to the fact that many users are students who are currently on their summer break.</p>
<h2>ChatGPT Unleashes OpenAI vs Google</h2>
<p>The launch of ChatGPT last year in November 2022 by OpenAI stormed the tech industry with many seeing the generative AI chatbot as a replacement to search engines in the future. This means that going ahead, OpenAI will be taking on tech behemoths like <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/google/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a>.</p>
<p>But compared to Google, which attracts around 84 billion visitors every month, ChatGPT currently has only 1.8 billion visitors as of the last report in April. For comparison, Bing, a search engine with only about 3% market share compared to Google&#8217;s 93%, has over 1.1 billion users.</p>
<p>OpenAI introduced the ChatGPT Plus subscription to its business model because the free version of ChatGPT was incurring very high computing costs, as mentioned by Sam Altman. Other companies have also benefited from using OpenAI&#8217;s technology.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft</a> partnered with OpenAI to incorporate GPT-4 into Bing Chat, creating a smarter search engine in the form of a chatbot. According to the analytics report from Similarweb, traffic to the OpenAI developer site increased by 3.1% from May to June.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/alibaba-ai-image-generation-model/">Alibaba Rolls Out AI Image Generation Model to Enhance Business Productivity</a></p>
<p>Chinese e-commerce giant <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/alibaba-group/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alibaba</a> has introduced a new AI image generation model dubbed Tongyi Wanxiang. The tool aims to enhance productivity and foster creativity for businesses nationwide. The new AI innovation was created and unveiled today by the company&#8217;s cloud services arm, Alibaba Cloud, during the World Artificial Intelligence Conference held on July 7.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/alibaba-cloud-unveils-ai-image-generation-model-tongyi-wanxiang-to-help-businesses-to-unleash-creativity-and-productivity_600170" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">official announcement</a>, the tool leverages generative AI technology to convert text prompts into visually captivating images. This innovative model supports a wide range of artistic styles, including watercolors, oil paintings, animations, and 3D cartoons. The newly launched AI technology is powered by Alibaba Cloud&#8217;s proprietary large model Composer, which enables the generation of photo-realistic images from any text input.</p>
<h2>Alibaba&#8217;s AI Model Responds to Text Prompts in Two Languages</h2>
<p>As part of its initial release, Tongyi Wanxiang is currently available for beta testing exclusively for corporate enterprises based in China. The new AI tool is expected to revolutionize multiple industries, including e-commerce, gaming, design, and advertising, by enabling businesses to unleash their creativity and explore new avenues of artistic expression through AI. The latest innovation is designed to respond to queries in Chinese and English.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the release of Tongyi Wanxiang, high-quality generative AI imagery will become more accessible, facilitating the development of innovative AI art and creative expressions for businesses across a wide range of sectors, including e-commerce, gaming, design, and advertising,&#8221; said Jingren Zhou, CTO of Alibaba Cloud Intelligence.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s cloud subsidiary is at the forefront of developing cutting-edge AI models to cater to the specific needs of businesses. Before Tongyi Wanxiang, the e-commerce giant successfully <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/alibaba-rolls-out-ai-chatgpt-tongyi-qianwen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> Tongyi Qianwen, another generative AI model that received an overwhelming response with over 300,000 beta testing requests since its launch in April. Tongyi Qianwen enables businesses to leverage AI technology across various sectors, such as fintech, electronics, transport, fashion, and dairy.</p>
<p>As Alibaba continues to expand its suite of digital tools, the company urged businesses to embrace the opportunities presented by AI technology. Daniel Zhang, Chairman and CEO of Alibaba Group and CEO of Alibaba Cloud Intelligence, emphasized the importance of keeping pace with AI advancements to avoid falling behind in the next generation.</p>
<h2>Alibaba Launches ModelScopeGPT to Solve Sophisticated AI Tasks</h2>
<p>In addition to Tongyi Wanxiang, Alibaba Cloud <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/alibaba-tmall-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> ModelScopeGPT, a versatile framework designed to streamline complex AI tasks across language, vision, and speech domains. The AI solution for sophisticated tasks is designed to leverage the company&#8217;s open-source tech community, ModelScope, as an interface to integrate various AI models, enabling more efficient and streamlined performance.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s move into the AI image generation space reflects the growing interest and investment in generative AI technology among tech giants globally.

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/multichain-130m-exploit/">Multichain Suspends Services Following $130M Exploit across Multiple Bridges</a></p>
<p>Open-source cross-chain router protocol Multichain (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/multichain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MULTI</a>) has confirmed that an exploit occurred on its protocol, affecting $130 million worth of tokens. The protocol asked its users to suspend all related transactions for now.</p>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://twitter.com/MultichainOrg/status/1677096839731097600?s=20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">tweet</a>, Multichain said although it is currently investigating the anomaly, it is not sure exactly what happened. The tweet then warned:</p>
<blockquote><p>“It is recommended that all users suspend the use of Multichain services and revoke all contract approvals related to Multichain.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In a subsequent tweet, Multichain said all services have been stopped, and “all bridge transactions will be stuck on the source chains”. The protocol added that there is no “resume time” for restoring the chain or completing its investigation exploit. According to data from CoinMarketCap, MULTI has lost 15% over the last 24 hours and more than 23% in the last 7 days.</p>
<p>Binance CEO Changepeng Zhao responded to Multichain’s announcement in a <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1677188504365809665?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweet</a>. Zhao assured users that the Multichain exploit has no bearing on Binance:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Looks like another hack happened on Multichain. This DOES NOT affect users on Binance or Binance itself. We have swapped all assets out and closed deposits a while back. Regardless, we offer our assistance in helping with the situation.”</p></blockquote>
<p>MetaSleuth, a crypto visualization and analysis tool by BlockSec, provided more <a href="https://twitter.com/MetaSleuth/status/1677140801665765377?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1677140801665765377%7Ctwgr%5Ef9e1896059f74cf2e9fa5fcd31f13bbb0b08c323%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomberg.com%2Fnews%2Farticles%2F2023-07-07%2Fmystery-120-million-outflow-hits-crypto-bridge-multichain-whose-ceo-is-missing" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">details</a>. According to MetaSleuth, over $120 million worth of assets were moved from Multichain: Moonriver Bridge and Multichain: Fantom Bridge. MetaSleuth added that the funds have been spread across 6 different addresses. The BlockSec tool also stated that the players behind the exploit have burned 1.2 million ICE, worth $1.8 million, from a “0x9d57” address.</p>
<h2>Binance Suspended Multichain-Bridge Tokens before Exploit</h2>
<p>On Wednesday, July 7, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> said it would <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-stops-deposits-withdrawals-8-multichain-tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suspend support</a> for withdrawals and deposits of several Multichain-bridged tokens starting today. The delisting follows a previous suspension that stemmed from delays in the Multichain protocol. In May, Binance suspended the tokens as transactions were delayed, and Multichain did not offer much information.</p>
<p>Following the recent suspension announcement, blockchain intelligence firm Arkham Intelligence confirmed that about $3 million in MULTI tokens moved to Gate.io, resulting in a 26.5% crash in the price of MULTI.</p>
<p>Multichain has had a few problems for a while now, including the alleged disappearance of its CEO. In May, the protocol <a href="https://twitter.com/MultichainOrg/status/1663941611380965376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1663941611380965376%7Ctwgr%5E824590d630ceade0599123dd628c209e5c1c957f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coindesk.com%2Fbusiness%2F2023%2F05%2F31%2Fcrypto-bridging-protocol-multichain-unable-to-contact-ceo-zhaojun%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suspended</a> cross-chain routes for several chains, a problem caused by “unforeseeable circumstances.” The tweet explained that fixing the problem was beyond the current permissions and ability of its team members and required input from its CEO. However, Multichain stated that it could not reach CEO Zhaojun to obtain the required permissions. The issue affected 11 chains, including Dyno Chain, PublicMint, Findora, and ONUS.</p>
<p>Several news reports stated that Chinese law enforcement had <a href="https://decrypt.co/142421/panic-over-1-5-billion-defi-bridge-multichain-shifts-to-fantom" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">arrested</a> a few members of Multichain’s team, including the CEO Zhaojun. Rumors also suggested that authorities seized a wallet containing tokens worth more than $1.6 billion. According to Defi Llama, Multichain has $1,262 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL) as of press time.</p>

<p>Bernstein believes that going ahead only big players would be able to survive as mining costs continue to rise. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bernstein-bitcoin-mining-ai/">Bernstein: Bitcoin Mining Is Game of Nerves, Might See AI Diversification</a></p>
<p>On Friday, July 7, private wealth management giant Bernstein published a report stating that <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> mining companies have been on a roll this year after facing a brutal crypto winter last year in 2022.</p>
<p>Along with the surge in the Bitcoin price, the stock price of public-listed Bitcoin mining companies has also doubled this year. Bernstein noted that the strong recovery in the crypto market along with institutional participation has played a crucial role in boosting the Bitcoin mining industry.</p>
<p>The report also states that some Bitcoin miners have been tapping new opportunities in high-performance computing along with artificial intelligence (AI) as part of their &#8220;revenue diversification strategy&#8221;. Bernstein analysts led by Gautam Chhugani <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/bitcoin-mining-is-a-game-of-survival-consolidation-and-potential-ai-diversification-bernstein-1032431673" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“This is a unique game of survival where the best-in-class miners with low costs and conservative debt profiles can survive, consolidate capacity and market share, to earn hyper-normal profits when bitcoin prices exceed the cost of production.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Big Crypto Mining Players Will Survive</h2>
<p>Bernstein also noted that the crypto mining industry will largely consolidate in favor of big players. This is because crypto mining is becoming more capital-intensive making it difficult for small players to survive.</p>
<p>Bernstein points out that mining companies with substantial debt struggle to survive and often succumb to market downturns, as evidenced by the recent bankruptcy of Core Scientific (CORZQ).</p>
<p>According to the broker, the initial phase of consolidation in the mining industry has already taken place, and the remaining miners are now expanding their capacity in preparation for the upcoming bitcoin halving. This event, which occurs approximately every four years and reduces mining rewards, often leads to an increase in the price of BTC. The next halving is expected around April 2024.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/jpmorgan-chase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JPMorgan</a>, a prominent Wall Street firm, stated in a recent report that the Bitcoin mining industry will gradually consolidate and become more competitive. Only miners with lower production costs will be able to sustain their operations in the long run.</p>
<p>Big crypto mining players are already taking bold measures. Crypto mining giant Hut 8 recently secured a <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/hut-8-mining-50m-credit-coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$50 million credit line</a> from Coinbase to expand its operations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitcoin-etf-approval-sec-jpmorgan/">JPMorgan: Bitcoin ETF Approval by SEC Won&#8217;t Revolutionize Crypto</a></p>
<p>In a research <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/07/sec-approval-of-spot-bitcoin-etf-is-unlikely-to-be-a-game-changer-for-crypto-markets-jpmorgan/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a> released on Thursday, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/jpmorgan-chase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co</a> (NYSE: JPM), one of the leading financial institutions in the world, believes that the approval of a spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-bitcoin-exchange-traded-fund-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ETF</a>) by the United States <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) would not have a transformative effect on the broader digital currency ecosystem.</p>
<p>The recent actions by <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/blackrock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlackRock Inc</a> (NYSE: BLK), <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/invesco/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Invesco Ltd</a> (NYSE: IVZ), <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/fidelity-investments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fidelity Investments</a>, and other asset managers to file for spot Bitcoin ETFs indeed reflect the growing interest and competition in the crypto space.</p>
<p>However, JPMorgan argues that the approval of a Bitcoin ETF may not automatically lead to a surge in investor participation or a significant shift in market dynamics as many have projected. The research highlights the lack of substantial investor interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs that have been available outside the United States, specifically in Canada and Europe.</p>
<p>Additionally, the report highlighted that Bitcoin funds in general, including both futures-based and physically backed funds, have experienced limited investor interest since the second quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the report points out that Bitcoin funds have failed to benefit from investor outflows from gold-traded ETFs over the past year. Notably, Gold has traditionally been considered a safe-haven asset and a store of value, often attracting investors during times of economic uncertainty or market volatility.</p>
<p>The fact that Bitcoin funds have not been able to capture the investor outflows from gold ETFs suggests that there might be specific factors or preferences influencing investors’ decision-making processes.</p>
<h2>Comparing Spot Bitcoin ETF to Future-Based Products</h2>
<p>The report acknowledges that physically-backed Bitcoin ETFs offer certain advantages over futures-based funds, albeit relatively marginal ones.</p>
<p>It highlights that spot ETFs provide a more direct and secure method to gain exposure to Bitcoin, eliminating some complexities associated with the custody and transfer of Bitcoin. In contrast, futures-based products involve basis risk and may not offer the same level of direct ownership.</p>
<p>One of the key advantages mentioned is that spot ETFs are more likely to reflect real-time supply and demand dynamics. This means that the ETF&#8217;s price would closely mirror Bitcoin&#8217;s actual price changes. This feature improves price transparency in spot Bitcoin markets and may result in improved liquidity.</p>
<p>The approval of spot ETFs in the US, according to the report, would bring several benefits to the crypto market. It would enhance price transparency, as investors would have access to real-time pricing information through the ETF. This increased transparency could also contribute to more efficient price discovery in the spot Bitcoin markets.</p>
<p>However, the bank noted that the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs has the potential to redirect trading activity and liquidity away from the earlier approved US Bitcoin futures markets if spot ETFs replace futures-based alternatives.</p>
<p>Remarkably, the coexistence of both spot ETFs and futures-based products remains a possibility, as they may serve different purposes and appeal to different types of investors.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/samsung-96-profits-loss-q2-2023/">Samsung Predicts 96% Profits Loss in Q2 2023</a></p>
<p>The past year has been challenging for Samsung Electronics as its semiconductor chip business took a downturn, extending into <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-announces-earnings-guidance-for-second-quarter-2023" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Q2 2023</a>. The hard time is eating deeply into the South Korean firm’s profits since it generates most of its revenue from the chip businesses. With the current situation, Samsung has released a worrying earnings estimate for Q2 2023, which stresses the persisting weak demand for memory chips. Many companies stockpiled memory chips during the pandemic as there was a spike in consumer devices. However, these companies are now experiencing excess chip investors amid rising inflation, causing consumers to spend less on electronics. This led to a fall in the price of memory chips.</p>
<p>In Q2 2023, Samsung expects quarterly sales to come in at around KRW 60 trillion (about $45.91 billion). It also said operating profits could come in at a meager KRW 0.6 trillion, around $459 million. Previously, it registered 14.1 trillion Korean won in the same period last year. This means that the manufacturer is about to record a 95.74% profit decline compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Also, this would be the second consecutive quarter the electronics corporation would report poor figures. Profits in Q1 2023 fell 96% YoY.</p>
<p>Samsung is about to see its lowest quarterly profits in 14 years with its Q2 2023 expectations. This prediction tallies with analyst expectations of 555 billion Korean won in profits. According to the company’s past earnings data, the last time it recorded such low figures was in Q1 2009. In addition, Samsung’s revenue forecast for Q2 is 63.75 trillion Korean won. The company had 77.2 trillion in revenue last year. This means that the second quarter revenue could drop 17.4% YoY.</p>
<p>The executive director of Daiwa Securities Capital Markets, SK Kim, weighed in on the current market situation for semiconductor chips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Demand remained weak. But now the key is the supply [of memory chips]. Samsung Electronics announced the meaningful production cut in early April so we anticipate [that] in the third quarter… With that, we assume that the prices can rebound at the end of this year or early next year,&#8221; said the expert.</p>
<p>While Kim noted that Samsung may benefit from the US demand, he also noted the weak demand from China.</p>
<p>Coinspeaker <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/samsungs-profits-low-chip-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hinted</a> that Samsung Electronics could see massive declines in Q2 2023. The report linked the slow sales to the unpleasant performance of its chip division, which has been the company’s primary source of profit. Samsung shares plunged over 2% in Friday morning trade.</p>

<p>In addition to launching Shibarium in August after the blockchain conference, Shiba Inu would likely provide more information on ecosystem projects.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/shibarium-layer-2-blockchain-august/">Shibarium Layer 2 Blockchain Set to Launch in August, Says Shiba Inu Lead Developer</a></p>
<p>The long-awaited Shibarium layer 2 (L2) blockchain will likely go live in August. Shiba Inu lead developer Shytoshi Kusama revealed the upcoming launch in a <a href="https://twitter.com/ShytoshiKusama/status/1676895600678170624" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a> published on Thursday, stating that Shibarium would go public after a scheduled conference in Toronto.</p>
<p>In the blog post, Kusama revealed a few other plans for the conference:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The completed Worldpaper will be exhibited, all Shib branded projects will be published and Treat will be published in detail for the first time. In addition, it is very likely that we will also discuss and release the long-awaited L2 Shibarium.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Members of the Shiba Inu community now expect a Shibarium launch at the Blockchain Futurist Conference in Toronto in August. Shiba Inu may also introduce DoggyDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) controlled by <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/shiba-inu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SHIB</a> holders. DoggyDAO would be used to fund Shibarium projects.</p>
<p>Shiba Inu has been working on Shibarium for several months, launching a testnet for the L2 platform called PuppyNet, on March 11, 2023. PuppyNet allows anyone to develop and deploy dApps (decentralized applications) for different uses. Also, users can integrate PuppyNet into their businesses for several functions, including a crypto payments processor, or a decentralized governance module.</p>
<p>As of June 11, PuppyNet’s total number of transactions crossed 20 million with an average block time of 5 seconds across more than 16.7 million wallet addresses. Public participation on the testnet indicates Shibarium’s potential acceptance as it points to significant demand for the L2 network. This could also potentially spike the prices of BONE and SHIB, Shibarium’s native tokens.</p>
<h2>Shibarium August Launch and Other Shiba Inu Plans</h2>
<p>Although information about Shibarium is the most anticipated, the Shiba Inu team has other plans for the Blockchain Futurist Conference in August. The team plans to show the SHIB community multiple presentations and demonstrations about several other projects from the ecosystem. There will also be discussions and expected feedback from the community about the future of Shiba Inu. Attendees will enjoy unveilings, showcases, and added information on several Shiba Inu projects, including Shiboshis, Shiba Eternity, Shibacals, and SHIB: The Metaverse.</p>
<p>Shiba Inu recently <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/shib-price-shiba-inu-shibacals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> Shibacals, a project that links non-fungible tokens (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFTs</a>) to real-world assets to better confirm authenticity and ownership. Kusama explained that the Shibacals project will digitally authenticate real-world goods using NFC chips. At the point of purchase, users can verify these tags on a blockchain to ensure purchases are for authentic products and not reproduced copies. In response to the announcement, SHIB jumped 11%.</p>
<p>In April, Shiba Inu developers <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/shiba-inu-metaverse-december-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> a December launch date for the ecosystem’s metaverse. Calling it a “partial” release, the developers specified that the metaverse may not be complete at the release. However, they promised its an “ongoing project”, with continuous improvements even after launch.</p>
<p>SHIB: The Metaverse will allow users to mint 100,595 plots of land where landowners can earn passive income and accumulate resources. Users can also create avatars and enjoy a metaverse economy that supports easy interaction with others, as well as more earning opportunities.</p>
