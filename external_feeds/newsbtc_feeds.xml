BTC failed to recover and started another decline below $27,000. There was a spike below the $26,550 support zone but the bulls were active near $26,500.

					<description><![CDATA[The recovery of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies at the start of the year brought about hopes that the bear market had finally come to an end. However, the market has since reversed with assets in the space losing a good portion of their Q1 gains. With the current trend, it is more than likely that the bear market is not over. Historical Bitcoin Trends Suggest Otherwise Over the last four bull markets that Bitcoin has seen since its inception, a number of things stand out. The first is that the bear market following a bull market does not seem to come to an end until the year of the halving. Related Reading: Here Are The Top 3 Chinese Coins To Buy As China Leads The Bull Run The Bitcoin Halving is an important event because it cuts down the BTC block rewards in half, hence reducing the number of new BTC being released into circulation. This is a bullish event and has always heralded the start of the bull market for the cryptocurrency. Currently, the market is still about a year away from the next Bitcoin halving set to happen in 2024, and if historical trends are anything to go by, then the bear market is likely to persist through 2023 and into early next year before the first hallmarks of the bull run are seen. Following previous trends, there could still be more pain for BTC to come.

As a result, investor sentiment has drawn to a standstill as the Crypto Fear &#38; Greed Index now sits at a neutral 52. This means that investors are not doing anything bullish like buying more Bitcoin at this time, so the bear market is persisting as sellers continue to dominate. A return back into the greed territory would see prices rise again but this is unlikely given that buyers are likely waiting for BTC to revisit $20,000 before getting back in the game.

					<description><![CDATA[Lido, the liquidity staking protocol that supports staking, is now under some of the Ethereum community members&#8217; crosshair. There are fears that the platform is centralizing Ethereum and could make the blockchain fragile. As of June 1, Lido is the largest decentralized finance protocol. DeFiLlama data shows that the platform manages $13.2 billion  in staked assets.  At this level, Lido has nearly twice the total value locked (TVL) as in MakerDAO, one of the original decentralized money markets in the sphere.  MakerDAO has $6.29 billion in TVL and only serves Ethereum. Lido Is Ethereum&#8217;s Weak Point? Concern from critics is not only about the dominance of Lido in terms of TVL but the number of validators using the protocol.  According to on-chain data, over 19 million Ethereum has been staked in the Beacon Chain, that is, the proof-of-stake network.  However, out of this amount, 6 million Ethereum has been staked through Lido. This translates to roughly 36% of all staked Ethereum passing through the liquidity staking protocol. Moreover, parallel data shows that 32% of all Ethereum validators use Lido infrastructure.  In Ethereum&#8217;s proof-of-stake system, validators are needed to verify transactions and secure the network against external attacks.  Related Reading: Litecoin Attempts To Revitalize The Crypto Market With Bullish Breakout The distribution of validators, who now don&#8217;t have to run energy-consuming and expensive rigs, is critical for decentralizing the Ethereum network.  Global distribution of Ethereum validators would translate to a robust platform where users and operators of protocols, presently managing over $26 billion of assets, don&#8217;t have to worry about a majority attack. It is this level of centralization that is emerging in Lido that some Ethereum community members are concerned could destabilize the network.  In the past, Prysm, a client operator, lost a significant portion of its market share when it was discovered that over 66% of all Ethereum proof-of-work nodes were using their software. Could this same intervention be require to suppress Lido&#8217;s expansion? According to the critics, the current community is lacking in educational material and initiative to address problems as they emerge. Thus far, with 32% of all validators using LidoDAO infrastructure, it is more than twice the limit Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, had recommended for every entity wishing to host the network&#8217;s validators.  LDO Prices Could Drop With centralization questions emerging, LidoDAO could be forced to decentralized, even by breaking down into multiple entities. However, for LDO holders, any action to break up the protocol&#8217;s dominance could have a drastic effect on prices. Related Reading: The $24,000 BTC Bullseye: Is Bitcoin Headed For A Summer Swoon? As of June 1, LDO, the governance token of LDO, is one of the top performers. From December 2022 lows, LDO has rallied 125% to spot rates, as more ETH holders opted to stake through Lido Finance infrastructure to earn annual rewards from the Ethereum proof-of-stake network.

					<description><![CDATA[Cryptocurrency exchange Gate.io has recently been facing rumors of insolvency following the arrest of Multichain CEO Zhaojun and concerns about the Multichain treasury being backed by 30%. These rumors have led to increased withdrawals from the exchange, with a net outflow of $131 million in the last 24 hours alone. To put this into perspective, the 7-day net outflow from Gate.io is $144.8 million, per data compiled by Nansen.  Related Reading: The $24,000 BTC Bullseye: Is Bitcoin Headed For A Summer Swoon? Gate.io Denies Liquidity Issues  The rumors about Gate.io&#8217;s insolvency stem from a tweet alleging a connection between the exchange and Multichain following the arrest of Multichain CEO Zhaojun. The tweet claimed that Gate.io was facing insolvency due to its involvement with Multichain and the potential impact of Zhaojun&#8217;s arrest on the Multichain treasury. Despite these rumors, Gate.io has disputed insolvency claims and reassured its users that all funds are safe. The cryptocurrency exchange has recently stated to address rumors about its operations and withdrawals. Gate.io has reassured users that its operations are sound, withdrawals are working properly, and there are no problems with rumored operations or withdrawals. Furthermore, Gate.io emphasizes its commitment to providing users with safe, fast, and reliable virtual asset services and encourages users to be cautious of any unsolicited calls or messages claiming to be from Gate.io. The exchange currently holds $2.4 billion in assets, including 18% in Gate.io’s native token GT, 15% in Ethereum (ETH), 15% in Bitcoin (BTC), and other cryptocurrencies. Despite these reassurances, the increase in withdrawals from Gate.io highlights the impact that rumors and speculation can have on the crypto market, particularly in times of uncertainty. However, Gate.io has stated that it has no direct connection to Multichain and that Zhaojun&#8217;s arrest does not affect its operations. The exchange has also emphasized that all funds are held in cold storage, providing an additional layer of security for user assets. Binance CEO CZ Issues Warning Binance CEO CZ has recently advised investors to Secure Asset Fund for User (SAFU) after citing a tweet from Multichain, which reported multiple issues with their protocol due to unforeseeable circumstances. The tweet stated that the team had done everything possible to maintain the protocol running but could not contact CEO Zhaojun and obtain the necessary server access for maintenance. The tweet also mentioned an issue with the scanning node network of Router5, which affected the normal cross-chain service of some chains. To protect users&#8217; interests, the corresponding cross-chain service for the affected chain was suspended on the User Interface (UI). This issue was also reported to have occurred on Router2 the week prior. Related Reading: Litecoin Attempts To Revitalize The Crypto Market With Bullish Breakout The timing of CZ&#8217;s advice to SAFU and the issues reported by Multichain has led to speculation that this may be an early warning to investors about the potential dangers associated with Gate.io. However, it is important to note that CZ did not explicitly mention Gate.io in his tweet, and there is no direct connection between Gate.io and Multichain.

<p>The rumors about Gate.io&#8217;s insolvency stem from a <a href="https://twitter.com/CoinSumption/status/1663952023027613698?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">tweet </a>alleging a connection between the exchange and Multichain following the arrest of Multichain CEO Zhaojun. The tweet claimed that Gate.io was facing insolvency due to its involvement with Multichain and the potential impact of Zhaojun&#8217;s arrest on the Multichain treasury.</p>
<p>Despite these rumors, Gate.io has disputed insolvency claims and reassured its users that all funds are safe. The cryptocurrency exchange has recently <a href="https://www.gate.io/ja/article/30962" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">stated</a><a href="https://www.gate.io/ja/article/30962" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> </a>to address rumors about its operations and withdrawals. Gate.io has reassured users that its operations are sound, withdrawals are working properly, and there are no problems with rumored operations or withdrawals.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Gate.io emphasizes its commitment to providing users with safe, fast, and reliable virtual asset services and encourages users to be cautious of any unsolicited calls or messages claiming to be from Gate.io. The exchange currently holds $2.4 billion in assets, including 18% in Gate.io’s native token GT, 15% in Ethereum (ETH), 15% in Bitcoin (BTC), and other cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Despite these reassurances, the increase in withdrawals from Gate.io highlights the impact that rumors and speculation can have on the crypto market, particularly in times of uncertainty. However, Gate.io has stated that it has no direct connection to Multichain and that Zhaojun&#8217;s arrest does not affect its operations. The exchange has also emphasized that all funds are held in cold storage, providing an additional layer of security for user assets.</p>
Binance CEO CZ Issues Warning
<p>Binance CEO CZ has recently <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1663973350115295235?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">advised </a>investors to Secure Asset Fund for User (SAFU) after citing a tweet from Multichain, which reported multiple issues with their protocol due to unforeseeable circumstances. The tweet stated that the team had done everything possible to maintain the protocol running but could not contact CEO Zhaojun and obtain the necessary server access for maintenance.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/MultichainOrg/status/1663941611380965376?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">tweet </a>also mentioned an issue with the scanning node network of Router5, which affected the normal cross-chain service of some chains. To protect users&#8217; interests, the corresponding cross-chain service for the affected chain was suspended on the User Interface (UI). This issue was also reported to have occurred on Router2 the week prior.</p>

<p>The timing of CZ&#8217;s advice to SAFU and the issues reported by Multichain has led to speculation that this may be an early warning to investors about the potential dangers associated with Gate.io. However, it is important to note that CZ did not explicitly mention Gate.io in his tweet, and there is no direct connection between Gate.io and Multichain.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin (BTC) has been on a rollercoaster ride for weeks. However, the largest cryptocurrency in the market seems poised to breach the $30,000 mark again if it continues its bullish momentum. Nevertheless, cryptocurrency experts are eyeing a key technical price level that could signal further volatility for the world&#8217;s most popular cryptocurrency. According to crypto expert and Economist Mr. Ben Lilly, the $24,000 price level is acting like a bullseye for Bitcoin, signaling a potential price dip in the coming months. Lilly&#8217;s analysis is based on Bitcoin&#8217;s 200-day moving average (200d MA), which he believes is a key technical indicator of the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price cycles. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Frenzy: More Than 15 Billion Tokens Scorched In May Bitcoin Braces For Volatility Each halving cycle for Bitcoin, which occurs roughly every four years, begins with the 200d moving average (MA) failing, as shown in a chart shared by Lilly. This failure tends to dictate multi-year price cycles, and Lilly believes history repeats itself. Based on this theory, Lilly predicts that the failure of the 200d MA level could happen sometime between June and August of 2023, which could result in a dip below $24,000. This prediction is supported by the fact that low-leveraged liquidity pools are building at the level where the 200d MA will likely be in June, which Lilly has marked with a bullseye in his theoretical analysis. If the history of Bitcoin&#8217;s price cycles is any guide, then this retest is likely to fail, which could result in further volatility for the cryptocurrency. Lilly expects this failure to occur with end-of-June options, citing the recent unwind of May contracts as a subtle sweep lower. However, it&#8217;s important to note that the 200d MA is rising faster than before, as each passing day removes one day from the November lows and replaces it with a recent price. This acceleration can be seen in the last week on the 200d MA, which is ticking up faster. Still On The Path To Higher Prices? On the other hand, despite recent volatility in the cryptocurrency markets, one expert remains optimistic about Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term prospects. Cryptocurrency analyst and trader Jackis believes that the current market conditions indicate a long re-accumulation period before Bitcoin moves higher. According to Jackis, Bitcoin is still making higher lows and is above all critical moving averages, which is a positive sign for the cryptocurrency&#8217;s long-term growth. While there may be short-term downside movements, Jackis believes these are simply shakeouts and that the big picture remains bullish. Jackis sees a big move coming in the future, which he has mentioned in previous posts. His bet remains on the upside, and he now sees no clear signs of bearishness in the market. One key factor that Jackis points to is the monthly close, which recently occurred with a sweep. This provides the biggest market picture; for now, Jackis does not see any bearish signs.

As of this writing, BTC is currently trading at $26,900, having filled the gap on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), previously highlighted by NewsBTC as a crucial level to observe before the uptrend could continue. Nevertheless, there is still a likelihood of further downside movements, with many industry experts anticipating high levels of volatility.

					<description><![CDATA[The Shiba Inu community burnt over 15 billion SHIB tokens in May 2023, showing their commitment to reducing the circulating supply. The intention of such burns is to reduce the total supply of the coin from market Blaze Token is the top SHIB burner of the month, with MARSWAP (MSWAP) and Coinbase 10 among the top burners. According to Shibburn, 15.36 billion SHIB, were burnt in 191 transactions in May 2023.  Top SHIB Burners Blaze Token emerged as the top SHIB burner for May 2023, with its largest burn executed on May 29, seeing over 3.60 billion SHIB tokens sent to the dead wallet. Also, Blaze token burnt 2 billion SHIB on May 2, 1.69 billion SHIB on May 8, and 1.23 billion SHIB on May 22. Related Reading: Did The US SEC Just Endorse Ethereum After This Settlement? A new crypto project, MARSWAP, ranks second on the top SHIB burners list. The crypto project launched on ShibSwap DEX burnt 1.35 billion SHIB in 100 transactions on May 24.  Additionally, a Coinbase-affiliated wallet tagged Coinbase 10 contributed 200.58 million SHIB burns to the total burns on the network. However, the increased burn rate did not affect Shiba Inu&#8217;s price as it still displays volatility.  SHIB Price Prediction SHIB is trading in a downtrend today, forming a fourth consecutive red candle on the daily chart as it forms lower lows. It is trading below its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), a short and long-term bearish sentiment. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Block Size Surges To 1-Month High – What This Means For ETH Also, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 35.64, close to the oversold region of 30. This also confirms the bearish sentiment as the indicator moves downwards.  SHIB&#8217;s Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is above its signal line but shows a negative value, and the histogram bars are fading, hinting at a bearish trend. These indicators imply that SHIB will likely continue in the bearish phase till the bulls rally again. SHIB is approaching the 38.2% Fibonacci level ($0.00000839), its closest support level. Hopefully, if SHIB doesn’t fall below that support level, it can rally to the 23.6% Fib level ($0.00000869), its nearest resistance level. A move above the $0.00000869 resistance level will mean a price recovery for SHIB.  Shiba Inu Reclaims Security Rating, A Plus For Its Network Shiba Inu reclaimed the top security rating on blockchain security audit company CertiK&#8217;s list. Previously, the company reduced Shiba Inu&#8217;s rating from AAA to AA, a second-class rating. Shiba Inu reclaimed the top security (AAA rating of 94 out of 100), which was its former security level. Also, CertiK hosted an Ask-Me-Anything (AMA) session on Twitter spaces to respond to questions from the community. The focus of the discussion bordered on the upcoming Shibarium mainnet, security ratings, and network tokenomics.

					<description><![CDATA[Data shows the hype around XRP has spiked as the asset has registered a 12% gain during the past week, something that may lead to a top. XRP Social Dominance Has Surged To High Values Recently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, crowd optimism around XRP has shot up recently. A relevant indicator here is the &#8220;social volume,&#8221; which measures the total number of unique social media text documents that are currently making mentions of a given coin or topic. These &#8220;social media text documents&#8221; refer to text-based posts or threads sourced from various popular social media platforms like Reddit, Twitter, and Telegram. Since this metric only measures the unique number of such documents, it means that even if a post mentions the cryptocurrency in question several times, its share of the social volume still only remains one unit. Because of this restriction, the indicator can provide a reliable picture of whether the users in the wider social media platforms are discussing the asset or not right now. Another indicator, called &#8220;social dominance,&#8221; is also of interest here; this metric compares the social media of the cryptocurrency (which would be XRP in the current case), to that of the combined social volume of the top 100 assets by market cap in the sector. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the XRP social volume, as well as the social dominance, over the last year: The two metrics seem to have observed some pretty high values in recent days &#124; Source: Santiment on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, both the XRP social volume and the social dominance have spiked to high levels recently. At the peak of this surge, the latter indicator had hit a value of 16.2%, which means that 16.2% of all discussions on social media websites related to the top 100 assets were about the token. Related Reading: Bitcoin Wealth Is Transferring From Old To New Hands, Why This Is Positive These elevations in the social metrics of the cryptocurrency have come as the price has outperformed all the largest coins in the market after registering a gain of more than 12% during the past week. Generally, whenever the social volume rises along with a price rise, it means that the investors are becoming more optimistic about the near-term outcome of the asset. While such positive attention can sometimes help fuel the price rise further, it&#8217;s also true that too much of it can actually have the opposite effect on the cryptocurrency. Historically, digital asset markets have tended to move against the expectations of the opinion of the crowd, so a large amount of hype and euphoria can offer the perfect recipe for the formation of a top to take place. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Takes Hit – Upsides Turn Attractive To Sellers The latest spike in the social dominance of XRP doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to be bearish, but it&#8217;s still something that can increase the probability of a top taking place. Though, there has also been a bullish sign for the asset recently, as the number of active addresses has rapidly increased. Such a trend is usually a sign that a large number of users are participating in the blockchain, which is something that can help the price rise to be more sustainable. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $0.5047, up 12% in the last week. Looks like the coin has enjoyed a rise recently &#124; Source: XRPUSD on TradingView Featured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Santiment.net]]></description>

<p>Since this metric only measures the unique number of such documents, it means that even if a post mentions the cryptocurrency in question several times, its share of the social volume still only remains one unit.</p>
<p>Because of this restriction, the indicator can provide a reliable picture of whether the users in the wider social media platforms are discussing the asset or not right now.</p>
<p>Another indicator, called &#8220;<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/internet-computer-icp-social-dominance-hits-top-in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">social dominance</a>,&#8221; is also of interest here; this metric compares the social media of the cryptocurrency (which would be XRP in the current case), to that of the combined social volume of the top 100 assets by market cap in the sector.</p>
<p>Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the XRP social volume, as well as the social dominance, over the last year:</p>

<p>As displayed in the above graph, both the XRP social volume and the social dominance have spiked to high levels recently. At the peak of this surge, the latter indicator had hit a value of 16.2%, which means that 16.2% of all discussions on social media websites related to the top 100 assets were about the token.</p>

<p>These elevations in the social metrics of the cryptocurrency have come as the price has outperformed all the largest coins in the market after registering a gain of more than 12% during the past week.</p>
<p>Generally, whenever the social volume rises along with a price rise, it means that the investors are becoming more optimistic about the near-term outcome of the asset.</p>
<p>While such positive attention can sometimes help fuel the price rise further, it&#8217;s also true that too much of it can actually have the opposite effect on the cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Historically, digital asset markets have tended to move against the expectations of the opinion of the crowd, so a large amount of hype and euphoria can offer the perfect recipe for the formation of a top to take place.</p>

<p>The latest spike in the social dominance of XRP doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to be bearish, but it&#8217;s still something that can increase the probability of a top taking place.</p>
<p>Though, there has also been a bullish sign for the asset recently, as the number of active addresses has <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ripple/xrp-bullish-address-activity-spikes-historical-levels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">rapidly increased</a>. Such a trend is usually a sign that a large number of users are participating in the blockchain, which is something that can help the price rise to be more sustainable.</p>
<h2>XRP Price</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $0.5047, up 12% in the last week.</p>
