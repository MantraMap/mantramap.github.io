<ul><li>Coinbase Derivatives Exchange will begin offering Bitcoin and Ether futures to its institutional clients starting June 5.&nbsp;</li><li>The institutional-sized futures contracts will be sized at 1 BTC and 10 ETH and have a monthly expiry.&nbsp;</li><li>The latest crypto offerings come amid growing demand from institutions for advanced derivatives products.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Coinbase Derivatives Exchange recently announced the launch of institutional futures offering with Bitcoin and Ether contracts. The CFTC-regulated derivatives trading platform will begin offering BTC and ETH futures contracts to its institutional clients starting June 5, 2023. The new crypto offerings come less than a year after the derivatives exchange launched its nano Bitcoin and nano Ether derivatives. </p>



<h2><strong>Coinbase Responds To Institutional Demand For Crypto Derivatives</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbase-derivatives-exchange-will-launch-institutional-sized-bitcoin-and" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a> by Coinbase, the institutional-sized contacts will be sized at 1 BTC and 10 ETH, allowing the derivatives exchange’s clients to manage their exposure to the crypto assets. The Bitcoin futures contracts (BTI) and Ether futures contracts (ETI) will be made available to clients through leading third-party institutional futures commission merchants (FCMs) and brokers. Institutional clients who adopt the new derivatives products early on may be eligible for various incentive programs. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“With the launch of these institutional-sized USD-settled contracts, we look to empower institutional participants with greater precision in managing crypto exposure, expressing directional views, or tracking Bitcoin and Ether returns in a capital-efficient way.”</p><cite>Coinbase Derivatives Exchange</cite></blockquote>



<p>The new derivatives products will be offered as USD-settled index futures and will have a monthly expiry. Each BTI and ETI contract represents 1 Bitcoin and Ether respectively. <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-manager-sec-settle-civil-charges/">Coinbase</a> stated in its offering documents that in case of a hard fork, the new token will not be added to the Index unless it becomes the “dominant coin.” The platform introduced the BTC and ETH futures contracts amid growing demand from institutional clients for advanced derivatives products. In June 2022 Coinbase Derivatives Exchange launched nano Bitcoin futures contracts for its retail clients. This was followed by the launch of nano Ether futures contracts in August 2022</p>

<ul><li>The MakerDAO community has voted in favor of a proposal to purchase $1.28 billion worth of U.S. Treasuries.&nbsp;</li><li>The proposal, dubbed Project Andromeda, was put forward by crypto investment firm Blocktower Capital.</li><li>Maker is set to exchange 1.28 billion DAI stablecoins for short-dated U.S. Treasuries with maturities ranging from 0-6 months.&nbsp;</li><li>The DeFi protocol purchased $1.1 billion of government and corporate bonds earlier this year.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>DeFi lending platform MakerDAO is set to purchase a whopping $1.28 billion worth of U.S. Treasuries in a bid to diversify the reserve assets that back its DAI stablecoin. The community behind Maker voted in favor of a proposal, dubbed Project Andromeda, to deploy a new vault with a debt ceiling of 1.28 billion DAI.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>MakerDAO To Purchase Short-Dated US Treasuries</strong></h2>



<p>According to the proposal submitted on MakerDAO’s <a href="https://forum.makerdao.com/t/project-andromeda-risk-legal-assessment/20969" rel="nofollow noopener">governance forum</a> earlier this month, Project Andromeda was put forward by Blocktower Capital Advisors LP under MIP90. As per the proposal, 1.28 billion DAI would be deployed to purchase short-dated U.S. Treasuries that will be held in custody by Wedbush Securities Inc. The maturities of the government bonds will range from zero to six months. As per the asset purchases schedule posted on the governance forum, 1/6th (16.67%) of the total DAI vault will be allocated to 0-1 month US Treasuries. Identical allocations have been listed for 1-2 month bonds, 2-3 month bonds, and so on. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmbudkVR#vote-breakdown" rel="nofollow noopener">polling page</a> showed that the MakerDAO community approved the proposal with an overwhelming majority, with 99.99% of the votes in favor of Project Andromeda. Blocktower Capital will receive an arranger fee equivalent to 0.15% of the vault, which comes out to over $1.9 million. Coinbase and Galaxy Digital will serve as exchange agents on the transaction, facilitating the conversion between stablecoins and U.S. Dollars.</p>



<p>The approval for the $1.28 billion U.S. Treasuries purchase comes just months after Maker’s community approved a proposal to increase its portfolio holdings of United States Treasury bonds by 150%, from $500 million to $1.25 billion. The latest approval comes just a day after fellow stablecoin issuer Circle <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/circle-dumps-us-treasuries-usdc-reserve/">eliminated</a> all U.S. Treasury bonds from the reserve fund backing its USDC stablecoin. </p>

<ul><li>Dogecoin investors have accused Elon Musk of insider trading and manipulating the price of DOGE.&nbsp;</li><li>The investors have requested to amend the class action lawsuit filed against Musk last year to include the latest allegations.&nbsp;</li><li>The DOGE holders alleged that Musk used Twitter posts and his online influence to manipulate the meme token’s price.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Dogecoin investors have accused Elon Musk of insider trading and manipulating DOGE. In a proposed amendment to an ongoing class action lawsuit, investors of DOGE accused the billionaire businessman of costing them billions of dollars by using his influence to manipulate the price of the world’s largest meme token and profiting himself in the process.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Musk Accused Of Using Twitter To Manipulate Dogecoin</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/elon-musk-is-accused-insider-trading-by-investors-dogecoin-lawsuit-2023-06-01/" rel="nofollow noopener">Reuters</a>, Dogecoin investors filed a request with the Manhattan Federal Court to amend the class action lawsuit that was initially filed against Elon Musk in June 2022. In what was the third amendment to the lawsuit, investors stated that the Twitter CEO used multiple Twitter posts, paid online influencers, and public appearances to manipulate DOGE’s price in order to trade profitably at their expense. </p>



<p>The investors included several instances of Musk’s alleged acts of manipulation, including his appearance on NBC&#8217;s Saturday Night Live in 2021 and showcasing Dogecoin’s Shiba Inu mascot on Twitter’s homepage last month. The filing alleged that Musk sold nearly $124 million worth of DOGE after it gained 30% thanks to its logo being displayed on <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/dogecoin-down-8-twitter-removes-doge-logo/">Twitter</a>. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>This is a securities fraud class action arising from a deliberate course of carnival barking market manipulation and insider trading by the world’s richest man Elon Musk”</p><cite>Court Filing by Dogecoin investors</cite></blockquote>



<p>U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein reportedly said that he would “likely” allow the latest amended complaint, noting that the defendants would not likely be prejudiced. Elon Musk’s lawyer declined a request for comment by Reuters. A lawyer for Musk’s EV giant Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. Earlier this year, Musk and Tesla requested the court to dismiss the second amended complaint filed by the Dogecoin investors, describing it as a &#8220;fanciful work of fiction.&#8221;</p>

<ul><li>Open Exchange (OPNX) has issued a new governance token for its bankruptcy claims exchange.&nbsp;</li><li>The exchange’s native token FLEX added 20% to its price following the announcement.&nbsp;</li><li>Holders of Open Exchange’s OX token can enjoy up to 100% discount on trading fees.&nbsp;</li><li>The ERC-20 OX token has a maximum supply of 9.86 billion.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Open Exchange (<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/opnx-investors-deny-funding-the-exchange/">OPNX</a>), the bankruptcy claims exchange launched by 3AC’s Su Zhu and Kyle Davies, has issued a governance token called the Open Exchange token (OX). The exchange has also launched its staking and governance platform called The Herd. OX token’s launch comes almost four months after the platform was set up by the disgraced founders of the defunct crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC). </p>



<h2><strong>OX Token Holders Can Get 100% Rebates On OPNX’s Trading Fees</strong></h2>



<p>As per the <a href="https://opnx-public-files.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/pdf/OX_Token.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">whitepaper</a> released by OPNX, as the platform’s governance token OX will offer a “Stake To Trade For Free&#8221; rebate model in an attempt to promote alignment between the bankruptcy claims trading platform and its users. According to Open Exchange, a convention fixed discount model only incentivized short-term holding of the token to pay trading fees while high minimum volume/holding bands are only accessible to whales &amp; require constant adjustment, causing confusion.</p>



<p>By staking the OX token, traders on the platform will be able to avoid paying trading fees irrespective of their trading volume. Traders will get a 100% rebate on trading fees if their percentage of total staked OX is equal to or greater than their percentage of total OPNX trading volume. Traders who exceed their 100% rebate-free trading volume will get a 50% trading fee rebate on the remainder. Open Exchange claims that with enough staked governance tokens, traders can engage in feeless trading in perpetuity.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>In one week, if Alice stakes 2% of total staked $OX and trades up to 2% of the total OPNX trading volume, she will receive a 100% trading fee rebate.” </p><cite>Example of trading fee rebate based on staked OX tokens</cite></blockquote>



<p>News of the OX token’s launch sent OPNX’s native token FLEX soaring. The native token has gained more than 20% over the past 24 hours. At the time of writing, the token was trading at $1.15. Meanwhile, the OX token has lost nearly 8% of its value since it was issued earlier today. Data from Etherscan shows that 150 people have either purchased or minted the governance token, which has a maximum supply of 9.86 billion.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Circle has ditched all U.S. Treasury bonds from the $24 billion reserve fund that backs its USDC stablecoin.&nbsp;</li><li>The stablecoin issuer took this step to protect USDC from the impact of the ongoing debt ceiling crisis in the United States.&nbsp;</li><li>The last Treasury bond worth $3.9 billion matured earlier today, effectively removing the asset class from the reserve fund.&nbsp;</li><li>The move was in line with CEO Jeremy Allaire’s goal to drop Treasuries from USDC’s reserve by the end of May 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Circle Internet Financial, the crypto giant behind the world’s second-largest stablecoin, has ditched all U.S. Treasury bonds from the reserve fund backing its USDC stablecoin. The move was made to shield USDC from any potential damage from the ongoing concerns surrounding the United States debt ceiling.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Circle Holds Assets In Overnight Repo Agreements</strong></h2>



<p>According to Circle’s <a href="https://www.circle.com/hubfs/USDCAttestationReports/2023/2023%20USDC_Circle%20Examination%20Report%20April%202023.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">monthly attestatio</a>n released by independent accountants at Deloitte, the last Treasury bond worth nearly $4 billion matured earlier today, effectively removing all long-term Treasuries from the reserve fund. As of May 30, 2023, the <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/circle-move-usdc-avalanche-ethereum/">Circle</a> Reserve Fund, managed by Wall Street giant Blackrock, held 100% of its $24.7 billion fund in overnight U.S. Treasury Repurchase Agreements. </p>



<p>The latest move marks a significant change in the fund’s holdings as compared to April 2023 when the USDC issuer held over $30 billion in U.S. Treasury Bonds. The changes to the Reserve fund came in light of the debt ceiling crisis in the United States, which could have had a devastating impact on all government securities. Lawmakers in the U.S. are set to vote on the fate of the country’s $31.4 trillion debt ceiling later today in a desperate attempt to avert a default by the U.S. government.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The decision to eliminate U.S. Treasury bonds was in line with the goal set by Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire. Allaire told <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-money/2023/05/10/rewriting-crypto-00096124" rel="nofollow noopener">Politico</a> earlier this month that his crypto firm would ditch the asset class in favor of short-dated U.S. Treasuries in a bid to protect its USDC stablecoin from a potential U.S. debt default. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We don’t want to carry exposure through a potential breach of the ability of the U.S. government to pay its debts.” </p><cite>Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle Internet Financial </cite></blockquote>

<ul><li>Binance is reportedly being probed by the Ontario Securities Commission.</li><li>The investigation is to determine if the crypto exchange attempted to evade local regulations and compliance controls.&nbsp;</li><li>The crypto exchange announced its departure from Canada two days after it was served the investigation order.&nbsp;</li><li>Binance is facing a similar probe in Brazil for allegedly helping clients evade a ban on derivatives trading.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Binance has found itself under regulatory scrutiny again, this time at the hands of a securities regulator in Canada. The Ontario Securities Commission is probing the world’s largest crypto exchange to determine if it attempted to avoid local regulations and compliance controls while seeking approval to operate in the country.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Binance Departed Canada Two Days After Receiving Probe Order</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-31/binance-bnb-discloses-investigation-by-canada-s-ontario-securities-commission" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, Binance was served the probe order by the Ontario Securities Commission on May 10, 2023. Just two days after the investigation was opened, the crypto exchange <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-exit-canadian-market-regulations/">announced</a> that it would exit the Canadian crypto market. At the time, the crypto exchange blamed its decision to depart on Canada’s “challenging” regulatory landscape and the recently introduced guidance for stablecoins and investor limits. The exchange did not reveal that it was being probed by one of the country’s top securities regulators. </p>



<p>Binance revealed the probe by the Ontario Securities Commission in a recent filing with the Capital Markets Tribunal. The investigation order didn’t allege any breaches of Ontario securities laws on the crypto exchange’s part. The summons issued by the securities regulator required the exchange to produce documents associated with the scope of the investigation. This includes a blanket request for “all communications regarding Ontario (or Canada generally) among directors, officers, employees, contractors, agents and consultants of the exchange and its associated entities. The summons was addressed to the exchange and didn’t name any individual.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“The Investigation Order authorizes an extremely broad inquiry into whether Binance may have taken steps to circumvent Ontario securities law and compliance controls in relation to Binance.com or engaged in conduct contrary to Ontario securities law and/or the public interest without any limitation.”</p></blockquote>



<p>The probe from the Canadian securities regulator comes a month after Brazil’s Federal Public Prosecutor’s Office and the Federal Police started an investigation into Binance for allegedly offering securities to its clients by helping them evade a stop order on crypto futures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>European Union lawmakers officially signed the bloc&#8217;s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) bill meant to standardize digital asset businesses across 27 member nations.</li><li>The bill is accompanied by new anti-money laundering rules that require exchanges and crypto providers to verify users&#8217; identities.</li><li>The EU is another step closer to implementing crypto standards and rules roughly three years after the bill was introduced, making the bloc the first major jurisdiction to provide clear rules for the nascent industry.</li></ul>



<p>The Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) bill developed to create standard rules for crypto businesses operating in EU states was <a href="https://twitter.com/sweden2023eu/status/1663924814002749442?s=20" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/sweden2023eu/status/1663924814002749442?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">officially signed</a> on Wednesday, May 31, and marks a watershed moment for the broader crypto industry. </p>



<p>MiCA&#8217;s policies which introduce a licensing framework are accompanied by new anti-money laundering rules that require exchanges and crypto providers to verify users&#8217; identities. The bill was first proposed in 2020, surviving endless parliamentary debates and revisions. </p>



<p>Controversy threatened to tarnish the bloc&#8217;s crypto rules when lawmakers mulled what was essentially a ban on Proof-of-Work blockchains like Bitcoin due to environmental concerns. Policymakers ultimately binned the idea, giving room for Bitcoin and other PoW-powered assets in European markets.</p>



<p>Nearly three years after its debut, MiCA is now officially into law by the European Parliament President Roberta Metsola and Sweden&#8217;s Rural Affairs Minister Peter Kullgren.</p>



<h2>What Next For MiCA?</h2>



<p>MiCA will be published in the EU&#8217;s Official Journal now that officials have signed. It will take weeks after this publication for MiCA to be recognized and impact the bloc&#8217;s regulatory landscape. However, the rules will not take full effect till 12-18 months after appearing in the Official Journal. This will give policymakers and crypto business time to adjust to the new status quo. </p>



<p>The bill <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/mica-greenlight-eu-finance-ministers/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/mica-greenlight-eu-finance-ministers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">requires </a>trading venues and wallet providers to secure a license before offering their services to EU users. Stablecoin issuers like Tether and Circle must also hold sufficient reserves if they wish to operate in any of the bloc&#8217;s 27-member states. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates published rules for businesses and institutions interacting with cryptocurrencies and digital assets.</li><li>The UAE&#8217;s new guidance will oversee anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing checks in compliance with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) international standards.</li><li>Policymakers from the UAE and Hong Kong are working together on developing digital asset laws as both regions move to establish themselves as global crypto hubs.</li></ul>



<p>On May 31, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Central Bank announced new guidance for anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) set to take effect next month, per <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N37S1OO" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N37S1OO" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reuters</a>.</p>



<p>New rules from the apex bank come amid a push from the Emirates toward attracting crypto businesses looking to expand and tap new markets. Local policymakers also met with companies like Coinbase to discuss regulatory matters. </p>



<p>According to a statement on Wednesday, the new guidance treats the risks associated with handling cryptocurrencies and digital assets like NFTs. The framework will provide needed oversight for institutions when doing business with digital asset service providers like exchanges. Customer and counterparty relationships will also fall under the purview of the newly issued guidance. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The new guidance related to the virtual assets sector contributes to strengthening the supervisory and regulatory frameworks of the Central Bank to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism.</p><cite>&#8211; Governor of the CBUAE, Khaled Mohamed Balama.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Governor Balam further remarked that the new rules will align the Emirati&#8217;s policies with international standards set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The FATF listed the UAE in its &#8220;grey list&#8221; of areas that needed to upgrade their AML and CTF systems back in March 2022. </p>



<h2>Hong Kong And UAE Policymakers Discuss Crypto Rules</h2>



<p>Authorities from the UAE and <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/hong-kong-considers-huobi-crypto-license/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/hong-kong-considers-huobi-crypto-license/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hong Kong</a> are reportedly working together to develop crypto standards needed to protect investors and entice crypto businesses to set up shops in their regions.</p>



<p>The central banks of Hong Kong and UAE recently met in Abu Dhabi to discuss this joint effort. Bank of China, Citi, HSBC, and Standard Chartered spoke for Hong Kong while First Abu Dhabi Bank, Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank, and Emirates NBD represented the Emirati Kingdom. </p>



<p>Cross-border trade and tapping Hong Kong&#8217;s burgeoning financial infrastructure were hot-button topics discussed by senior executives from both sides of the aisle. </p>



<p>Both regions have introduced crypto licensing regimes while Dubai, an emerging crypto hub in the Emirates, was the first jurisdiction to establish a body dedicated to digital asset oversight. Hong Kong&#8217;s licensing regime is set to come into effect starting June 1 after the city-state ended its long-standing crypto ban. </p>



<p>Crypto stakeholders like <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-engage-uae-lawmakers/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-engage-uae-lawmakers/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a> met with UAE policymakers, hailing the region for its approach to digital assets amid the thickening regulatory atmosphere in the U.S. </p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>Law enforcement in China arrested the Trust Reserve team behind a Yuan-backed stablecoin and another token backed by the Hong Kong Dollar. </li><li>Authorities wrote a “judicial seizure” notice at the teams&#8217; office in Shanghai, PANews reported after visiting the building.</li><li>The news follows unverified rumors that Multichain’s team was also arrested in China shortly after a so-called &#8220;force majeure&#8221; froze thousands of transactions on the cross-chain protocol.</li></ul>



<p>Reports from PANews said that police in China arrested team members from Trust Reserve, the entity formerly known as the CNHC Group that issues two fiat-pegged stablecoin backed by China&#8217;s Yuan (CNH) and the Hong Kong Dollar (HKD). </p>



<h2>Trust Reserve Shares Same Faith As Multichain</h2>



<p>Authorities wrote a “judicial seizure” notice at the Trust Reserve office in Shanghai, <a href="https://www.panewslab.com/zh/sqarticledetails/7pomrdow.html?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=auto&amp;_x_tr_hl=en-GB" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.panewslab.com/zh/sqarticledetails/7pomrdow.html?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=auto&amp;_x_tr_hl=en-GB" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PANews</a> reported after visiting the building on May 29. Law enforcement reportedly informed the families of the arrested team members as well. Trust Reserve closed a $10 million series A+ funding round led by Kucoin Ventures in March. </p>



<p>The news follows unverified rumors that Multichain’s team was also <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/deposits-halted-binance-multichain/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/deposits-halted-binance-multichain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrested</a> in China shortly after a so-called &#8220;force majeure&#8221; froze thousands of transactions on the protocol. Liquidity providers like the Fantom Foundations and other stakeholders like Justin Sun pulled out millions from Multichain citing uncertainty about the protocol&#8217;s bridge infrastructure and silence from the team. </p>



<h2>Hong Kong Open To Crypto, Beijing Remains Cautious</h2>



<p>While crypto trading, mining, and digital asset transactions remain banned in China, Beijing&#8217;s government is seemingly ready to consider web3 innovation. The capital city recently released a white paper to promote decentralized development. </p>



<p>Over in Hong Kong, authorities are laying the groundwork for a crypto ecosystem as the region introduced a licensing regime. Huobi HK already applied for a virtual asset exchange license and will offer crypto spot trading support. Other digital asset service providers like OKX are also interested in a similar license per reports. </p>



<p>Hong Kong is also collaborating with the central bank and policymakers in the UAE as both regions move to capture crypto&#8217;s attention amidst a lack of regulatory clarity in the U.S.</p>

<ul><li>The SEC has agreed to settle insider trading charges filed against a former Coinbase manager and his brother.&nbsp;</li><li>The duo was arrested for insider trading crypto assets last year and was convicted for multiple wire fraud charges.&nbsp;</li><li>The settlement has left unanswered the question of whether the nine crypto tokens involved in the case were securities.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has agreed to settle the insider trading charges filed against former Coinbase Manager Ishan Wahi and his brother Nikhil Wahi in the infamous crypto insider trading case from last year. The Wahi brothers were arrested for profiting from an insider trading scheme using material insider information from the American crypto exchange.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Wahis To Return Ill Gotten Gains From Coinbase</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-98" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> from the SEC, the securities regulator and the Wahi brothers have agreed to settle the charges related to the insider trading scheme involving the listing of nine crypto tokens on Coinbase. Both the accused have agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the Securities Exchange Act and return the ill-gotten gains from the crypto exchange, as well as the prejudgement interest. If approved by the Manhattan Federal Court, the SEC will not seek civil penalties against Ishan and Nikhil Wahi in light of their prison sentences. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The federal securities laws do not exempt crypto asset securities from the prohibition against insider trading, nor does the SEC. I am grateful to the SEC staff for successfully working to resolve this matter.” </p><cite>Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement</cite></blockquote>



<p>The settlement between the securities regulator and the Wahi brothers brings the controversial court case to an end. The SEC claimed in its initial complaint that the nine crypto tokens involved in the case were securities. The settlement would leave the question regarding the tokens’ security status unanswered. Ishan Wahi was <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-manager-2-years-insider-trading/">sentenced</a> to two years in prison earlier this month. His brother is currently serving a 10-month prison sentence. The brothers were ordered to forfeit more than $920,000 obtained from their insider trading scheme. </p>
