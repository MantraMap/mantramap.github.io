										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Coinbase will allow users to deposit and withdraw USDC through the Stella network.</em></li>



<li><em>The partnership announcement will make storing and transferring funds easier than ever.</em></li>



<li><em>USDC on Stellar can offer &#8220;nearly zero&#8221; transaction costs and complete transactions in as little as five seconds.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><a href="https://news.coincu.com/197495-coinbase-has-victory-with-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a> has added support for USD Coin (USDC) on Stellar, the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) said on June 23. That announcement indicates that Coinbase will allow both regular Circle withdrawals and deposits through the Stellar network.</strong></h5>

<p>By supporting USDC on Stellar, Coinbase provides a critical access point for both companies and users to benefit from faster and low-cost USDC.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24USDC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$USDC</a> on Stellar is now officially supported by <a href="https://twitter.com/coinbase?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@Coinbase</a>!  Coinbase’s millions of users can now benefit from near-instant speeds on USDC deposits and withdrawals via Stellar, and more easily access the network of real world utility.

<p>The SDF says that Coinbase&#8217;s support for USDC on Stellar will allow faster and less expensive transactions. Specifically, it says that USDC on Stellar can offer &#8220;nearly zero&#8221; transaction costs and can complete transactions in as little as five seconds. Banks, fintechs, and exchanges can leverage USDC&#8217;s infrastructure, speed, and low costs on Stellar&#8217;s rails to access and build use cases around the digital dollar genuinely global.</p>

<p>Stellar has developed a vast global network of interoperable on/off links powered by anchors: wallets, exchanges, and fintech businesses transferring value from fiat to digital or digital to fiat on and off the network. The SDF added that the addition would introduce a &#8220;significant [on/off] ramp&#8221; to USDC and Stellar&#8217;s existing wallets, exchanges, and fintech businesses. Coinbase Assets acknowledged the feature in its own tweet. There, the company wrote that USDC on Stellar will make storing and transferring funds easier than ever.</p>



<p>Before that, Stellar and Coinbase began by launching the Coinbase Earn program in 2019 to bring blockchain and crypto education to the masses.</p>



<p>Circle initially launched USDC on Stellar in February 2021. USDC stablecoin also exists as a native asset on Ethereum, Solana, TRON, Avalanche, Hedera, Algorand, and Flow and as a bridge asset on other chains.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The SPACE ID airdrop event announced on June 9th attracted a large number of registrations, but the overwhelming presence of Sybil, with over 60% of the total registrations, is raising concerns.</strong></h5>

<p>Binance Launchpad project SPACE ID has been making headlines recently with its upcoming airdrop event. However, concerns have been raised about the high proportion of Sybil registrations, which could potentially manipulate the system. </p>



<p>According to X-explore, between June 15 and June 16, 2023, Sybil controlled more than 2,000 addresses to bulk register at SPACE ID. This follows from the recent announcement of the airdrop event on June 9, which attracted a large number of registrations, with Sybil accounting for over 30% of the total. In fact, over the past week, the proportion of Sybil even exceeded 60%.</p>

<p>On 9 June, SpaceID said that the project&#8217;s Voyage Season 2 is coming to an end soon, and Calling &amp; Striking Points, and boost factors are being calculated using the data collected throughout the season. </p>

<p>The ID airdrop for Season 2 was expected to commence at the end of June, along with distribution and claim details. Additionally, a draft proposal for the ID token buyback (3/23 &#8211; 6/23) will be submitted on the DAO forum soon for review and executed following the voting decision by ID token holders.</p>



<p>It is worth noting that the actions of the Sybil-controlled accounts are unclear. While they may have been attempting to manipulate the airdrop, they could also be legitimate users who were creating multiple accounts for other reasons. Regardless of the intentions behind the registrations, it is important for SPACE ID to address the issue to ensure the project&#8217;s integrity.</p>

<p>Mercado Bitcoin officially became a payment institution on June 2, a week after the pilot participants were identified.</p>



<p>&#8220;Our participation validates the Central Bank&#8217;s intention to bring innovation to the financial system with those who have already been working with this technology and not just with the incumbents who have appropriated it,&#8221; said Fabricio Tota, director of new business at Mercado Bitcoin, Valor added.</p>



<p>As previously reported, in May this year, the Central Bank of Brazil <a href="https://news.coincu.com/190038-brazils-central-bank-cbdc-institutions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selected </a>14 institutions to participate in the CBDC pilot project, including large local private banks such as Bradesco, Nubank, and Itaú Unibanco, as well as such as Brazil&#8217;s largest bank Banco do Brasil and domestic securities companies B3. Multinational companies such as Visa and Microsoft were also selected to participate in the project.</p>

<p>Midway through June 2023, the central bank will add participants to the Real Digital Pilot platform. Glovo claims that the consortium plans to take part in testing the issue of CBDC and Treasury bills as well as the technical components of the network and the distributed ledger technology&#8217;s governance architecture.</p>



<p>Brazil&#8217;s central bank aims to <a href="https://news.coincu.com/151742-brazil-plans-to-launch-its-cbdc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launch</a> the digital currency by 2024 after a closed pilot program next year with financial institutions, bank president Roberto Campos Neto said on Tuesday time adding that the project has received international attention.</p>



<p>Speaking at an event hosted by news website Poder 360, Campos Neto said the central bank&#8217;s digital currency design would encourage banks to tokenize their assets, with significant results.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The market&#8217;s largest Layer 2 announced that Optimism had changed its name to OP Mainnet.</em></li>



<li><em>This move is intended to reflect the goal of creating a &#8220;superchain&#8221; with multiple layer two networks on the OP Mainnet itself.</em></li>



<li><em>The superchain will operate a software stack called OP Stack to allow developers to create their own L2 blockchains.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to official news, Optimism has changed its name to OP Mainnet. The move is intended to reflect the goal of creating a &#8220;superchain&#8221; consisting of multiple L2 networks, with the OP Mainnet serving as the base layer for the &#8220;superchain&#8221;.</strong></h5>

<p>OP Mainnet operates on Optimistic Synthesis, a technology aggregating Ethereum transactions on a secondary layer. The adoption of this technology enables faster and cheaper transaction processing, addressing the growing scalability concerns in the Ethereum network.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It’s official: the chain formerly known as Optimism is now OP Mainnet!<br><br>This distinction makes clear the delineation between the OP Mainnet blockchain and the Collective, vibe, and ethos that “Optimism” encompasses.</p>&mdash; Optimism (<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f534.png" alt="🔴" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />_<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f534.png" alt="🔴" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />) (@optimismFND) <a href="https://twitter.com/optimismFND/status/1672281032962478080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June 23, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>OP Labs, the developer of the OP Mainnet, operates a development software stack known as the<a href="https://news.coincu.com/189427-op-stack-brings-optimism-to-superchain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> OP Stack</a>, which allows developers to launch their own Layer 2 blockchains. Cryptocurrency exchange giant Coinbase is developing its own Blockchain, called Base, using the OP Stack.</p>



<p>Prior to that, on June 6, Optimism completed the most significant upgrade of the platform, Bedrock, which brought many important improvements to reduce fees, shorten asset deposit times, increase node performance, and become an Ethereum-like network.</p>



<p>Bedrock has turned Optimism into a multi-client ecosystem, meaning there will be at least two options for the client software used to run the network. This means there will be at least two options for projects to use to launch the network. If something goes wrong with one client software, the Blockchain can rely on other users running other client software to keep the network running.</p>



<p>The price of $OP has steadily increased since the Bed Rock upgrade was launched and succeeded. It is currently trading at $1.38. $OP has not had too much volatility even though 587 million USD of $OP tokens were unlocked on June 3.</p>

<p>The competition of Layer 2 is getting more and more fierce, so this update is expected to be a stepping stone for Optimism to thrive in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Bitcoin Cash&#8217;s open interest grew significantly during the Bitcoin boom.</em></li>



<li><em>EDX Markets, a cryptocurrency exchange sponsored by major financial institutions, accepting BCH sparked its recent run.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>When the Bitcoin boom persisted, it was discovered that open interest in Bitcoin Cash (BCH) grew dramatically.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1813.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1813-1024x576.png" alt="Bitcoin Cash Grows Over %200 In Just 2 Weeks, $200 Is It Possible?" class="wp-image-197559" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1813-1024x576.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1813-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1813-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1813-750x422.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1813.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Bitcoin Cash Grows Over %200 In Just 2 Weeks, $200 Is It Possible? 8"></a></figure></div>


<p>Since <a href="https://news.coincu.com/195477-blackrock-to-expand-more-bitcoin-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BlackRock</a> filed to start a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), the industry has surged, and that optimism has not waned today, owing partly to experts pointing out what a catalyst it might be if BlackRock wins clearance from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>



<p>Bitcoin Cash also maintained its spectacular run, which was started earlier this week by news that the crypto exchange <a href="https://news.coincu.com/196594-edx-markets-now-available/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EDX Markets</a>, a cryptocurrency exchange sponsored by Wall Street firms, had gone online and was now accepting Bitcoin Cash as one of its cryptocurrencies. EDX is funded by Charles Schwab, Fidelity, and Citadel, indicating yet another entry into the digital asset area by major financial institutions. Just four cryptocurrencies were listed on EDX: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash.</p>

<p>Despite today&#8217;s big increase, the BCH rate remains optimistic on a local time frame. At the moment, it reached $194 and quickly retraced to $180.</p>



<p>If looking for a potential buying opportunity, buyers should keep an eye on the $150 price zone, as this is the resistance, it just broke through quickly.</p>

<p>Bulls seem to need more time to collect energy for future expansion since the majority of currencies have started a corrective phase. BCH is no exception, now perhaps what we should do is wait for a correction to enter. Not except for the scenario that Bitcoin is at a price that excites investors and continues to increase, perhaps BCH will reach the $200 price zone in the near future without any price retest.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>FTX founder Bankman-Fried&#8217;s subpoena request denied by US judge.</em></li>



<li><em>Law firm Fenwick &amp; West cannot be compelled to produce documents.</em></li>



<li><em>The law firm provided advice on issues at the core of the US government&#8217;s allegations against Bankman-Fried.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to a court judgment <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940.166.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued</a> on Friday, Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s request to subpoena law firm Fenwick &amp; West as part of his criminal defense was denied.</strong></h5>

<p>Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York refused Bankman-Fried&#8217;s plea on Friday, stating that neither Fenwick &amp; West nor the FTX Debtors are members of the &#8220;prosecution team.&#8221; The government is under no responsibility to provide materials that are not in its ownership, custody, or control, according to the decision.</p>



<p>A New York District Court Judge refused Bankman-Fried, the founder of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, his request to subpoena law firm Fenwick &amp; West as part of his criminal defense. The judge&#8217;s decision implies that the US government is not required to release any papers given by the legal firm, and they are no longer in their custody, possession, or control.</p>

<p>In a May court filing, the creator of crypto company FTX claimed that he relied on assistance from a Silicon Valley legal firm on many of the problems that are now at the heart of the US government&#8217;s charges against him. <a href="https://news.coincu.com/195031-sam-bankman-fried-gets-appeal-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bankman-Fried</a> noted creating a North Korean bank account and using auto-deleting Signal communications as instances of legal advice he&#8217;d followed.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>He attempted to persuade US prosecutors to turn over papers provided to the government by the legal firm or to get a court order subpoenaing Fenwick &amp; West LLP for the same materials.</p>



<p>The company has lately come under additional attention, with rumors claiming that the legal firm Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher has been engaged to assist Fenwick &amp; West in dealing with the ramifications of its partnership with FTX.</p>



<p>Ultimately, the judgment underlines the difficulties that Bankman-Fried will have in defending himself against criminal allegations. It also emphasizes the significance of seeking legal counsel from a reputable law firm that knows the complexity of cryptocurrencies and can provide good advice on how to operate in this fast-changing environment. The criminal prosecution of Bankman-Fried is scheduled to commence later this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Bullish predictions suggest Bitcoin could retest its highs of $69,000 within the next four months, requiring substantial bullish momentum.</em></li>



<li><em>Bitcoin&#8217;s recent rally to $30,000 and an increase in the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index indicate a positive market sentiment, potentially leading to a retest of all-time highs.</em></li>



<li></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to bullish forecasts, Bitcoin might retest its highs of $69,000 during the next four months, assuming significant bullish momentum.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/0_o3p77F5nxK4t6c54.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="602" height="338" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/0_o3p77F5nxK4t6c54.png" alt="Bitcoin Might Yet Reach $69,000 This Year???" class="wp-image-197543" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/0_o3p77F5nxK4t6c54.png 602w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/0_o3p77F5nxK4t6c54-300x168.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" title="Bitcoin Might Yet Reach $69,000 This Year??? 14"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>However, it appears like BTC will not remain at this level for long, since bullish predictions have begun to surface. A stunning prediction made by a trader known as Credible Crypto has piqued the community&#8217;s interest.</p>



<p>Credible Crypto recently predicted that Bitcoin will retest its highs of $69,000 during the next four months in a tweet. However, the trader highlighted that for Bitcoin to attain this aim, the following four months must offer substantial bullish momentum.</p>



<p>Throughout June, Bitcoin has performed admirably. The king coin has increased by 17% in the last week. This adds to the confidence about a possible BTC rally. To maintain this momentum, BTC must produce larger monthly green candles, as seen during prior significant bullish periods. This goes from $3,000 to $14,000 and $10,000 to $60,000.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BTC_1D_graph_coinmarketcap.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BTC_1D_graph_coinmarketcap-1024x683.jpeg" alt="Bitcoin Might Yet Reach $69,000 This Year???" class="wp-image-197544" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BTC_1D_graph_coinmarketcap-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BTC_1D_graph_coinmarketcap-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BTC_1D_graph_coinmarketcap-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BTC_1D_graph_coinmarketcap-750x500.jpeg 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BTC_1D_graph_coinmarketcap-1140x761.jpeg 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BTC_1D_graph_coinmarketcap.jpeg 1394w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Bitcoin Might Yet Reach $69,000 This Year??? 15"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Around this time, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/197397-bitcoin-bulls-matrixports-greed-fear-index/">Bitcoin</a> successfully retested monthly support, with $25,000 now potentially serving as a springboard for a new &#8220;parabolic rally.&#8221;&#8221; With that in mind, let&#8217;s take a look at where we are now: the monthly retest is complete, and the largest monthly candle we&#8217;ve seen so far is a step. &#8220;The 10k move broke above the 25k monthly barrier,&#8221; claimed Credible Crypto.</p>



<p>The dealer indicates that the upward movement has begun. This suggests that Bitcoin might have monthly gains of more than $10,000.</p>



<p>&#8220;If this is a parabolic rally, this gap should be filled in a few monthly candles.&#8221; That&#8217;s all there is to it &#8211; an estimate based on the argument stated above. I&#8217;m not saying we HAVE to set a new all-time high in October; rather, I believe we will by the end of the year, and if I had to pick a month in which I believe this would occur, it would be October. &#8220;Let&#8217;s see how things go,&#8221; said Credible Crypto.</p>



<p>As previously stated, BTC recently witnessed a significant bull run, hitting as high as $30,000, the highest level recorded since April. The Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index (GFI) increased from 10% to 93% in a week as a result of BTC&#8217;s momentum. Matrixport oversees the GFI, which tries to evaluate the general sentiment of the cryptocurrency market.</p>



<p>As a result, a score of 90% or above suggests excessive greed or optimism, while a score of 10% or lower shows extreme fear or pessimism. According to data, the occurrence of an index exceeding 90% on the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index frequently corresponds with transitory BTC price peaks. Readings below 10%, on the other hand, frequently presage BTC market rallies and recoveries.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The SEC has approved the Volatility Shares ETF, the first leveraged crypto ETF, allowing investors to obtain exposure to the cryptocurrency market for half the price of Bitcoin.</em></li>



<li><em>The ETF is correlated to the CME Bitcoin Futures Daily Roll Index and is set to debut on June 27, 2023.</em></li>



<li><em>The approval of this ETF has fueled optimism that the sector is getting closer to winning permission for a spot BTC ETF in the near future, reflected in Bitcoin&#8217;s recent surge in price.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The SEC&#8217;s clearance of the 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF, often known as <a href="https://www.volatilityshares.com/bitx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BITX</a>, lays the door for the Volatility Shares ETF to debut on Tuesday, June 27, 2023.</strong></h5>

<p>This will make the exchange-traded fund (ETF) the first leveraged crypto ETF to be approved by the SEC. The Volatility Shares ETF will enable consumers to obtain exposure to the cryptocurrency market for half the price of Bitcoin.</p>



<p>According to the prospectus, the ETF would correlate to the CME Bitcoin Futures Daily Roll Index.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the <a href="https://news.coincu.com/197281-microstrategy-gains-0-03-profit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a> price topped $31,000 on Friday after reports that Blackrock had filed an application with the SEC for a Bitcoin ETF. With the likes of BlackRock and WisdomTree now betting on the crypto product&#8217;s acceptance, the positive attitude around the Bitcoin token is suddenly skyrocketing and reflected in its price.</p>



<p>Bitcoin is now trading at $31,244, having risen by more than 3.6% in the last 24 hours. This is the best price the cryptocurrency has seen since the beginning of the year. Bitcoin has gained an extra 20% in the week to far, adding to its previous gains.</p>

<p>One critical attitude propelling bitcoin development at the moment is the SEC&#8217;s recently authorized leveraged Bitcoin ETF product. Volatility Shares Trust submitted the Bitcoin ETF product, and the timing of the acceptance has fueled optimism that the sector is getting closer to winning permission for a spot BTC ETF in no time.</p>



<p>This Bitcoin ETF product is the SEC&#8217;s second unique ETF clearance since the Futures Bitcoin ETF from ProShares sparked a wave of similar approvals more than a year ago.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Belgium&#8217;s FSMA has ordered Binance to immediately stop servicing local consumers in Belgium.</em></li>



<li><em>The exchange is facing legal issues, including a complaint by the US Securities and Exchange Commission alleging 13 violations.</em></li>



<li><em>It also has withdrawn from several European Economic Area countries due to regulatory concerns.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to a Friday <a href="https://www.fsma.be/en/news/fsma-orders-binance-cease-immediately-all-offers-virtual-currency-services-belgium" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">notification</a>, Belgium&#8217;s Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA) has ordered the troubled cryptocurrency exchange Binance to immediately stop servicing local consumers.</strong></h5>

<p>Binance is marketing and delivering exchange services in Belgium between virtual currencies and legal currencies, as well as custodial wallet services, from nations that are not members of the European Economic Area, according to Belgium&#8217;s top markets regulator.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;The FSMA has therefore ordered Binance to cease, with immediate effect, offering or providing any and all such services in Belgium,&#8221; according to the notification.</p>

<p>This comes at a time when Binance Global and <a href="https://news.coincu.com/197332-binanceus-resolves-withdrawal-cases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance.US </a>are embroiled in legal issues. On June 5, the US Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint against the exchange, alleging 13 different things. According to one of the lawsuit&#8217;s accusations, monies from these companies were combined into an account managed by Merit Peak Limited that included Changpeng Zhao.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1805.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="959" height="639" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1805.png" alt="BREAKING: Binance Was Ordered To Stop Service Immediately In Belgium" class="wp-image-197532" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1805.png 959w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1805-300x200.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1805-768x512.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1805-750x500.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 959px) 100vw, 959px" title="BREAKING: Binance Was Ordered To Stop Service Immediately In Belgium 21"></a></figure></div>


<p>Another claim is that the US subsidiary used a hidden Market Maker (MM) named Sigma Chain, which is also controlled by CZ. As a result, the SEC first recommended freezing all Binance.US assets, but the two parties eventually struck a compromise.</p>



<p>After that, the cryptocurrency market began to tremble. Binance.US also had issues after delisting more than 100 trading pairs from the Advanced Trading interface and discontinuing the OTC service. Simultaneously, the values of BTC, ETH, and BNB on the platform started to diverge from the global average.</p>



<p>The exchange is also under regulatory scrutiny as it fights US Securities and Exchange Commission claims that it violated securities laws and was recently reported to be the focus of a French inquiry. Over regulatory concerns, the exchange has also withdrawn from European Economic Area countries such as the <a href="https://news.coincu.com/196803-binance-failed-to-register-netherlands/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netherlands</a> and Cyprus.</p>

<p>The purpose of the proposal is to stimulate the liquidity of the stETH ecosystem on Mantle. Additionally, the proposal aims to attract DeFi integration to the Mantle network, including Uniswap, Curve, and other decentralized exchanges.</p>



<p>Mantle, which recently merged with BitDAO, maintains one of the largest community vaults in the crypto ecosystem.</p>



<p>That includes $500 million worth of Ether and $300 million in stablecoins, according to DeepDAO. In addition to these operations, the core team of the project is also working on the development of the Ethereum Layer 2 network.</p>



<p><a href="https://news.coincu.com/194662-lido-doesnt-use-ldo-reward/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lido Finance</a> is known for its decentralized liquid staking protocol, designed to help users earn rewards from staking Ethereum while retaining liquidity via its token, stETH. The platform emphasizes the security of staked assets through regular security audits and a robust infrastructure. Furthermore, its Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) governance model democratizes decision-making, enhancing its appeal to users.</p>

<p>The proposal goes beyond a considerable investment, incorporating a revenue-sharing agreement between BitDAO and Lido DAO. If ratified, this agreement would ensure that a portion of the revenue accrued by the Lido DAO treasury is redistributed to BitDAO over a period of 12 months. Additionally, this will create a strategic partnership between Lido and Mantle.</p>

<p>Lido’s stETH represents a liquid tokenized claim on staked Ethereum. The smart contracts that power this functionality have undergone rigorous audits, which underscore their robustness.</p>



<p>The utility of stETH is substantial due to its widespread integration across the DeFi space. It allows holders to earn staking rewards while participating in other DeFi activities, thereby enhancing its utility. Moreover, its integration with leading DeFi protocols like Curve, 1inch, and Aave attests to stETH’s broad acceptability and usage.</p>



<p>In addition, stETH offers high liquidity, making it a market leader. With billions of USD worth of stETH staked across multiple DEXes and ecosystems, the risk of inadequate liquidity is substantially minimized.</p>
