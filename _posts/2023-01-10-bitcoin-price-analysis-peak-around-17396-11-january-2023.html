<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) gave back some recent gains early in the Asian session as the pair orbited the 17267.87 area, a level that represents the 38.2% retracement of the appreciating range from 15460 to 18385.36.&nbsp; Traders pushed BTC/USD as high as the 17396.25 area, its strongest print since mid-December and one that was reached after Stops were elected above the 17329.38 area, representing the 50% retracement of the depreciating range from 18385.36 to 16273.40.&nbsp; Technical bids emerged around the 17143.71 area during subsequent pullbacks, right around the 23.6% retracement of the appreciating range from 16326.16 to 17396.25.&nbsp; Traders recently drove BTC/USD as low as the 16326.16 area after Stops were elected below the 16375.18 area, a downside retracement level related to selling pressure around the 18385.36 and 17525 levels.&nbsp; Additional related downside price objectives related to these areas of selling pressure include the 15900, 15313, and 14364 levels.&nbsp; If BTC/USD reclaims some upside momentum, additional technically significant upside retracement levels include the 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
