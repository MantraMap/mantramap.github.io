Bizmarvel’s CCUD device and system will reward companies’ efforts to pursue carbon neutrality with NGR tokens to encourage them to reduce carbon emissions continuously. Individuals can also join the carbon neutrality campaign to convert their activity points to NGR tokens and enjoy the value together.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>INTERNET CITY, DUBAI, Dec 16, 2022 – LBank Exchange, a global digital asset trading platform, has listed PayPointCoin (PPC) on December 16, 2022. For all users of LBank Exchange, the PPC/USDT trading pair is now officially available for trading.</p>
<p>As a universal loyalty program protocol, <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x6fc0d20c7dE9a0ae891B39b3DD916F5ffcc7f33F" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">PayPointCoin</a> (PPC) uses blockchain technology to track all transactions within the protocol, providing more rewards to loyal customers. The PPC token has been listed on LBank Exchange at 8:00 UTC on December 16, 2022, to further expand its global reach and help it achieve its vision.</p>
<p><strong>Introducing </strong><strong>PayPointCoin</strong></p>
<p>Addressing some of the challenges that current loyalty programs face due to inefficient data management, and lack of data privacy and ownership, PayPointCoin is a universal loyalty program protocol that can revolutionize the way that merchants track and distribute rewards points and coupons so that more perks and benefits will be provided to loyal users. It uses blockchain features such as smart contracts, wallets, and tokens to track all the transactions within the protocol.</p>
<p>Specifically speaking, PayPointCoin allows transaction ledgers to be shared across a network of participants. When a new transaction occurs (e.g. loyalty points are issued, redeemed or exchanged) a unique PayPointCoin is created and assigned to that transaction. PayPointCoins are grouped into blocks and distributed throughout the network, updating all ledgers at once.</p>
<p>By leveraging the blockchain technology, PayPointCoin makes it easy to track each transaction and its history, while making it irreversible, avoiding double-spending, fraud, abuse and other types of transactions manipulation. In addition, by allowing multiple parties to record and access transactions in near real-time, blockchain increases the opportunity for loyalty rewards program providers to reduce adjustment inertia for credit points more quickly.</p>
<p>Furthermore, PayPointCoin is supposed to reduce costs associated with errors and fraud by reducing system administration costs with smart contracts that report transactions securely, traceably and transparently to legacy systems. Large loyalty rewards program providers with well-developed programs in the early stages of building interconnected loyalty networks have a unique opportunity to provide value-added services to other businesses.</p>
<p>Last but not least, for consumers juggling different loyalty programs, blockchain provides instant redemption and can be exchanged for multiple loyalty points currencies on a single platform. With only one &#8220;wallet&#8221; for points – the PayPointCoin Wallet, consumers do not have to look for options, restrictions and usage rules for each program.</p>
<p><strong>About PPC Token</strong></p>
<p>PPC is the native token of PayPointCoin ecosystem. Based on ERC-20, PPC has a total supply of 2 billion (i.e., 2,000,000,000) tokens, of which 30% is provided for the ecosystem, 25% will be used for marketing, 20% is allocated for investment, 10% is provided for partners, 7% will be used to provide liquidity for transactions on the platform, 5% is allocated to the team, and the remaining 3% is allocated to advisors.</p>
<p>In addition, 100% of the revenue stream is used to buy back tokens from the market. They are then burned each month, reducing the total circulating supply, and increasing the value of PayPointCoin tokens.</p>
<p>The PPC token has been listed on LBank Exchange at 8:00 UTC on December 16, 2022, investors who are interested in the PayPointCoin investment can easily buy and sell PPC token on LBank Exchange right now. The listing of PPC token on LBank Exchange will undoubtedly help it further expand its business and draw more attention in the market.</p>

<li>Bitcoin price started a fresh decline below the $17,200 zone against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>The price is now trading below $17,200 and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours).</li>
<li>There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $17,180 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair could start another decline if it stays below the $17,350 resistance zone.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Bitcoin price is struggling below $17,200 against the US Dollar. BTC might extend losses if it stays below the $17,200 and $17,350 resistance levels.</em></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price Analysis</h2>
<p>Bitcoin price started a <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-aims-more-upsides-18k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">fresh decline</a> below the $17,800 zone. There was a steady decline below the $17,500 and $17,350 support levels.</p>
<p>The decline gained pace below the $17,200 level and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). The bears even pushed the price below the $16,500 level. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $17,180 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair.</p>
<p>The price again tested the $16,250 support zone and is now correcting losses. There was a minor increase above the $16,700 level. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $18,385 swing high to $16,273 low.</p>
<p>The price is now trading below $17,200 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-aims-upside-break-above-18k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4-hours)</a>. An immediate resistance on the upside is near the $17,200 level.</p>
<p>The next major resistance might near the $17,350 zone. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $18,385 swing high to $16,273 low. The first major resistance is near the $17,500 level. A clear move above the $17,500 level might send the price towards $18,000, above which the price might rise towards the $18,500 level.</p>
<p>Any more gains might push the price towards the $19,000 zone. If there is no upside break, the price might continue to decline below $16,700. The next key support is near the $16,500 level, below which the price might accelerate lower.</p>
<p>In the stated case, the price could decline towards the $16,200 level. Any more losses might send the price towards the $15,500 level.</p>
<div id="attachment_76088" style="width: 1834px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2022/12/Bitcoin-2.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-76088" class="size-full wp-image-76088" src="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2022/12/Bitcoin-2.png" alt="Bitcoin Price" width="1834" height="845" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-76088" class="wp-caption-text">Bitcoin Price</p></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not long ago, <em>Live Bitcoin News</em> reported that the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-ftx-arena-is-changing-its-name-following-exchange-collapse/" data-wpel-link="internal">FTX Arena for the Miami Heat</a> was going to change its name following the collapse of FTX, the now disgraced cryptocurrency exchange based in the Bahamas. The company wanted nothing to do with the firm’s rotten legacy, and now Cal – aka the California Memorial Stadium/ FTX Field – is <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/ncaafb/welcome-to-cals-ftx-field-a-naming-rights-deal-funded-by-cryptocurrency/ar-AA1479xl" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">looking to do the same</a>.</p>
<h2>Cal Doesn&#8217;t Like the Letters FTX Anymore</h2>
<p>Cal has stated that what happened with FTX is wrong and it wants no part in whatever shady deals FTX may have conducted. It doesn’t need this kind of trouble and is now looking to engage in a legal name change so the FTX letters are removed from its banner forever.</p>
<p>Cal serves as the home football field for the Golden Bears team. A few years back, Cal announced that it was joining hands with the now fallen digital trading platform and would be taking on a name change as a means of supporting the company’s legacy and operations.</p>
<p>The naming deal was set to last a full ten years. At the time, Cal director of athletics Jim Knowlton said the field had allegedly found a “great partner” in the digital exchange, and they were looking forward to a future filled with profit and possibilities. He stated in an interview at the time:</p>
<blockquote><p>We believe we have found a great partner in FTX. FTX is a growing company at the forefront of innovation in an emerging technology, one that fits well at both Cal and in the Bay Area. This agreement extends well beyond field naming rights, which is part of our strategic plan to diversify revenue streams in support of our student-athlete experience, and includes commitments for our Cameron Institute, Cal Veterans, and students in need here in Berkeley. We are looking forward to building our relationship now and in the years ahead.</p></blockquote>
<h2>One of Crypto&#8217;s Most Embarrassing Moments</h2>
<p>The collapse of FTX is likely going to go down as one of the most devastating (and embarrassing) things to happen within the confines of the crypto space. FTX first came to fruition in the year 2019. From there, it looked like a glorious future was written in the clouds for the exchange, and the company’s head executive – then 27-year-old Sam Bankman-Fried – was lauded as a genius businessman of sorts by several experts in the arena.</p>
<p>However, that reputation has faded fast as just a few weeks ago, the now crushed exchange ran to Binance for help, begging the larger competitor to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-ii-binance-said-it-would-buy-the-firm/" data-wpel-link="internal">buy it out in</a> part to an ongoing liquidity crunch the company was experiencing. While it looked like the deal was going to go through, Changpeng Zhao – the head of Binance – <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-iii-the-rise-and-fall-of-sam-bankman-fried/" data-wpel-link="internal">eventually backed out</a>, claiming the problems the firm was facing were too big.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sam Bankman-Fried – the disgraced runner of now failed crypto exchange FTX – gave a lot of his money to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/crypto-billionaire-sam-bankman-fried-spends-big-in-the-name-of-politics/" data-wpel-link="internal">democrat candidates during</a> the midterm elections… So much, in fact, that he’s been listed as the <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/11/10/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-joe-biden-democratic-party-second-biggest-donor/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">second highest donor</a> to said candidates this season.</p>
<h2>The Filth of Sam Bankman-Fried Fell into D.C.</h2>
<p>This raises big questions <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/democrats-took-his-shady-crypto-money-will-they-keep-it/ar-AA147TZO" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">regarding where the money came</a> from and how it was used. Many people are wondering if the money given to democrats was filthy or had been laundered in some way. It’s not like Bankman-Fried – or SBF as he’s so commonly called – has the cleanest record to his name. There’s far too much coming out about the situation now, and several of these democrats are now being asked if they’re going to part with the money that they received from him.</p>
<p>In most cases, it seems like the obvious thing to do would be to give the funds back and say, “I won’t accept your filthy, lousy endorsement.” Strangely, however, that doesn’t seem to be the case with some of these candidates, who claim they are either keeping the funds or have given them to good causes. These slimy politicians will say just about anything necessary to keep paychecks rolling in, won’t they?</p>
<p>Representative Ruben Gallego – a democrat from Arizona – says he took the money he received from Bankman-Fried and put it towards the campaign of Andrea Salinas, a Latin woman that ran for – and won – a seat in Congress representing a district of Oregon. In an interview, he said of the funds:</p>
<blockquote><p>So, I think I’ve paid it back.</p></blockquote>
<p>Representative Carolyn Bourdeaux, a Georgia representative, was not on the receiving side when it came to money stemming from Bankman-Fried or the PAC he created, while her challenger was. She didn’t win her election, and says she has mixed feelings about the unraveling of FTX that followed. She commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>I knew that this was a very risky financial instrument, and these guys were likely to come to a bad end. Early on, I called for Lucy to disavow this funding. She had no control over it, but she could have at least said, ‘This is not appropriate.’</p></blockquote>
<h2>No Easy Way Out</h2>
<p>She continued to claim that the fraud surrounding SBF and FTX are relatively obvious, and she’s convinced lawmakers will come down hard on both. She mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>The horse is out of the barn. The fraud is so obvious, [and] what happened is so egregious that it’s going to be very hard for members to say, ‘We shouldn’t intervene to regulate this sector.’</p></blockquote>
<p>At the time of writing, Bankman-Fried is under supervision in the Bahamas, where FTX is stationed. He is facing potential fraud charges in that nation, though he could also face criminal charges in the U.S.</p>
