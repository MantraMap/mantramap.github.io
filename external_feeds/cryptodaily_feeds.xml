			  <description><![CDATA[<p>There is no denying that 2022 has been catastrophic for the crypto market, with trillions wiped from the total market cap. Coinbase, one of the world&rsquo;s most successful crypto exchanges has recorded a year-to-date plunge of more than 85%, sending its market cap below that of Dogecoin. </p>
<p>The continued market crisis has taken its toll on numerous crypto firms in 2022 and the market suffered a further blow with the collapse of FTX with crypto exchanges, in particular, reeling from the fallout. According to reports by CoinDesk, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has dipped 17% over the past 30 days. This significant decline brings the exchange&rsquo;s year-to-date plunge to more than 85%. Coinbase (COIN) shares have tumbled as the exchange struggles with record-low trading volumes amid falling crypto prices. The significant decline in stock prices has driven the company&rsquo;s market cap to less than $8 billion compared to the meme project Dogecoin which currently has a market cap of roughly $10 billion.</p>
Fall of FTX Brought About a Fear of Exchanges
<p>When cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapsed in November, contagion quickly spread throughout the market as traders and investors became fearful of storing their assets on exchanges. Investors have been pulling crypto from exchanges at record rates in favour of self-custody of their assets. The largest outflows that have been recorded have been Bitcoin. In November, 91,557 bitcoins worth a whopping $1.5 billion left exchanges which include Binance, Kraken, and Coinbase.</p>
Coinbase Grows User Base Despite Market Downturn
<p>Despite the harsh conditions experienced in the crypto market, Coinbase has managed to onboard 19 million verified users to its platform this year. Reports suggest that Coinbase added 19 million users globally between December 31, 2021, and September 30, 2022 &ndash; a growth percentage of 21.35%. This data represents at least two million users joining the platform per month in 2022.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>With crypto continuing to receive much bad press, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are being quietly prepared for roll out.&nbsp;</p>
Crypto bad press
<p>Crypto has imploded in on itself over the last several months as firstly it has been in a year-long bear market, and secondly, several of the centralised lending platforms and funds have collapsed after bad loans or fraudulent management.</p>
<p>The mainstream media has had a field day as first one crypto platform collapsed, then another, and then a few more. It could be likened to a series of banks going down, as the bad loans triggered contagion throughout the system - but of course, central banks would have been on hand (and taxpayers) to bail them out.</p>
<p>Crypto just hasn&rsquo;t had a break, and to be quite honest most of the flak has been deserved. Lessons learnt from the debacle would probably be that decentralisation is the way to go, and know-how on self-custodying ones digital assets in order to keep them away from any third party is extremely important.</p>
<p>Those representing government, the banking industry, and the regulatory agencies will feel vindicated and will be thinking that most of the battle to destroy the holding of all private digital assets must be won.</p>
CBDCs quietly being prepared for roll out
<p>Amid all the crypto carnage and the very public scrutiny of this tiny little asset class, the real business of propping up an exponentially larger fiat monetary system has been under way.</p>
<p>More than 100 countries around the world have been developing their own central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the central bank of central banks, anticipates that all will issue their CBDCs in 2023 through to 2025.</p>
Why you should be worried
<p>So what is the issue here?</p>
<p>Nick Saponaro, CEO of Decentralised Payment Platform Provider, Divi Labs contributed an article on the situation to Nasdaq.com. He wrote:</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of the key features is the programmability of currency which would allow central banks to set limits on how much you can buy, where you can buy it, when you can buy it and how much you can save.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He also penned the following very worrying concern on CBDCs:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The biggest concern is the ability to create negative interest rates. This is not the same as the negative interest rates we&rsquo;ve recently seen in the Eurozone. Whereas negative interest rates with traditional currencies effectively pay you to borrow, negative interest rates in a CBDC system mean any currency you don&rsquo;t spend would be slowly destroyed. This would give central banks even greater economic control, the likes of which have never been seen before. The end game is the complete loss of financial sovereignty for the user.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A change on this scale, in how people make payments, has arguably never been seen in the history of the world. With very little in-depth media coverage of CBDCs, the vast majority of civilisation is not likely to be informed and educated on what is coming.</p>
<p>Once CBDCs are rolled out, there may be very few alternatives available to escape the iron grip of central banks. Currently, crypto is still open to the average retail investor, but with crushing regulation fast approaching, this avenue might not still be there when everyone needs it most.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s3">Because of the recent bear market, most cryptocurrency investors are quite scared to get their hands on investments. </p>
<p class="s3">While the bear market has affected some of the best-performing cryptocurrencies, such as Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE), new cryptocurrency projects, such as Sparklo, have emerged to fill in the gap. </p>
<p class="s3">Solana (SOL) Growth Drops By Almost 90%</p>
<p class="s3">Solana (SOL) creates a layer-one smart contract for taking cryptocurrency investments to the next level. With this, many cryptocurrency investors started paying attention to Solana (SOL). </p>
<p class="s3">However, the recent market conditions have been terrible for Solana (SOL) investors. The current trading value of SOL token is around 90% low when compared to its previous all-time high. And according to experts, this will not rise in the near future. </p>
<p class="s3">Dogecoin (DOGE) Value Has Also Dropped By Around 90%</p>
<p class="s3">Another similar cryptocurrency struggling from the bear market is Dogecoin (DOGE). This is a cryptocurrency that has an excellent history as a meme coin. Even though Dogecoin (DOGE) is still the most popular meme coin in the world, there will be better decisions than investing in it. That&rsquo;s because the market value has dropped by around 90%. Even active investors of Dogecoin (DOGE) are giving up on their investments.</p>
<p class="s3">Sparklo (SPRK) Is An Ideal Option For Investment</p>
<p class="s3">With Dogecoin (DOGE) and Solana (SOL) dropping their value significantly due to the bear market, investors are looking for a more promising alternative investment, like Sparklo. Sparklo, currently in its presale stage, was able to grab the attention of newbies and professional crypto investors. </p>
<p class="s3">As a cryptocurrency protocol, Sparklo aims to be the first investment platform to allow its members to invest in gold, silver, and platinum bars. Each investment will result in an NFT being minted and fractionalized.</p>
<p class="s3">The current price of Sparklo is only $0.013, and it is expected to increase by 4,000% soon.</p>
<p class="s3">Given its potential growth, there is no doubt that Sparklo will eventually become a blue-chip crypto.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Payment giant Visa on Monday published a paper that outlines how it could possibly in future collaborate with the Ethereum network on automatic payments. </p>
<p>Visa has proposed a solution known as &ldquo;account abstraction&rdquo; that utilizes smart contracts to enable automated programmable payments on the Ethereum network. Visa&rsquo;s proposal would involve creating a smart contract that will act as an intermediary between user accounts and a contract account and would allow for the creation of a self-custodial wallet enabled to make automatic and recurring payments without the need for a user actively participating in the process per reports by CoinDesk. Visa added that such a solution would allow recurring payments to be processed entirely over blockchain networks and have suggested deploying the functionality on the Ethereum layer 2 network StarkNet. Such capabilities are not yet possible on the Ethereum mainnet.</p>
Auto-Payments Signal Visa&rsquo;s Commitment to the Crypto Space
<p>Cryptocurrency auto-payments will not necessarily have the greatest impact on banking and payments but do signal payment giants such as Visa&rsquo;s commitment to becoming active participants in the crypto space. Visa&rsquo;s Head of CBDC and Protocols spoke to Decrypt and said:</p>

<p>We want to have an opportunity to actively contribute to technical developments happening in the crypto ecosystem. The best way to do that is learning by doing&mdash;actually getting deeper into Web3 infrastructures and blockchain protocols, areas I think are going to be really important for payments.</p>

<p>Visa is not entirely new to the crypto space. Blockchain.com recently announced the launch of a pre-paid crypto-centric Visa card in which each Blockchain.com Visa card is linked to a verifiable Blockchain.com Wallet account. Customers using these cards will be able to use their crypto or fiat balance to pay online for physical goods and services at U.S. merchants that accept Visa cards.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Volatility Elevated:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 21 December 2022</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) experienced elevated volatility early in the Asian session as the pair expanded its recent range that saw it recently orbit the 16880.44 area, a level that represents the 23.6% retracement of the depreciating range from 21478.80 to 15460.&nbsp;&nbsp; Stops were elected below the 16375.18 level during a move lower, an area that is a downside price objective technically related to selling pressure that recently emerged around the 18385.36 and 17525 levels.&nbsp; During the subsequent recovery, BTC/USD tested another price objective around the 16849.58 level that is also related to the same areas where selling pressure commenced.&nbsp; Additional related downside price objectives related to these areas of selling pressure include the 15900, 15313, and 14364 levels.&nbsp; If BTC/USD reclaims some upside momentum, additional technically significant upside retracement levels include the 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, the 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Below these areas, technically significant levels include the 14613, 14500.15, 13369, 10432.73, 10727, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 200-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and below the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;200-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 16817.63 and the&nbsp;100-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 16876.31.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;14500.15/ 13369.11/ 10727.75 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;18495.40/ 19199.48/ 20070.64 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bullishly above MACDAverage.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bullishly above MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>As Brazil prepares to adopt a crypto payments regulatory framework, Gleec BTC Exchange is taking advantage of the change in sentiment with the acquisition of Blocktane, a local crypto exchange service provider that has been operational since 2020. This strategic acquisition is also expected to lay the ground for Gleec&rsquo;s expansion into the larger Latin American crypto market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gleec BTC Exchange said in a press release that the company will acquire Blocktane&rsquo;s legal entity, the brand name and online domains. Additionally, the exchange is set to take control of Blocktane&rsquo;s native token BKT and its treasury inventory, while onboarding Blocktane&rsquo;s former management team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For context, the recently passed Bill No. 4,401 by Brazil&rsquo;s Chamber of Deputies will allow the use of crypto assets as a means of payment throughout the country. However, it is still awaiting the president&rsquo;s signature, after which it will become law within six months. Once enacted, this will be a big milestone for Brazil, joining a few other jurisdictions that have already followed a similar path.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gleec BTC Exchange expects this bill to play a major role in the expansion of its crypto services in the Brazilian market. The exchange said it will be launching operations in the next few weeks, bringing along more advanced tools and products to enhance the experience of crypto natives who have been using Blocktane exchange.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are pleased to partner with Gleec to bring their tool and products to Blocktane&rsquo;s users in Brazil, and their first entry into that domestic market,&rdquo; said&nbsp; former Executive Chairman of Blocktane, John Willock.</p>

<p>Besides crypto exchange services, Gleec BTC Exchange will provide access to its already existing crypto products which include Gleec&rsquo;s crypto visa card and a popular play-to-earn game Gleec racing. The exchange also features a digital point of sale tool known as Gleec SV, currently being offered in the El-Salvador crypto market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gleec BTC Exchange&rsquo;s parent company Gleec Holdings further said that Brazil&rsquo;s move to adopt a crypto regulatory framework was the main motivation behind the strategic acquisition. Most importantly, the bill will enable Brazilians to access the crypto market through secure and reliable platforms that are regulated by the authorities.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Indian government on Monday provided Parliament with clarity regarding its cryptocurrency bill as well as the status of investigations into crypto exchanges. </p>
<p>The government of India has provided information to various members of Lok Sabha, the lower house of India&rsquo;s parliament, on its plans to regulate cryptocurrencies as well as investigations into crypto exchanges, according to reports by Bitcoin.com.</p>
Government Provides Updates on its Crypto Bill and Regulatory Plans
<p>Parliament member Bhartruhari Mahtab asked the Minister of Finance to indicate &ldquo;the current status of the cryptocurrency bill, which was due for being tabled during the winter session, 2021, of the Parliament&rdquo; and the expected timeframe within which the crypto bill would be tabled and be open to public input.</p>
<p>Without providing a specific timeframe, Pankaj Chaudhary, minister of state in the Ministry of Finance, replied:</p>

<p>Crypto assets are by definition borderless and require international collaboration to prevent regulatory arbitrage. Therefore, any legislation on the subject can be effective only with significant international collaboration on evaluation of the risks and benefits and evolution of common taxonomy and standards.</p>

<p>The Finance Minister was asked to state which ministry and/or department would be responsible for regulating cryptocurrencies and tokens. Chaudhary was also asked which department would regulate other forms of &ldquo;virtual digital assets,&rdquo; including NFTs, decentralised applications (dApps), real estate tokens, and other blockchain-based assets, to which he responded:</p>

<p>Currently, policy related to crypto assets and related ecosystem is with the Ministry of Finance.</p>

Details Regarding Crypto Exchanges Under Investigation Also Sought
<p>Members of parliament also requested &ldquo;the details of crypto exchanges which are under investigation by the government for money laundering and tax evasion cases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Minister Chaudhary explained to Parliament that India&rsquo;s Enforcement Directorate (ED) is currently investigating numerous cases related to cryptocurrency fraud in which some exchanges have also been found to be involved in money laundering. He explained that as of December 14:</p>

<p>Proceeds of crime amounting to Rs. 907.48 crores have been attached/seized, three persons have been arrested and four Prosecution Complaints have been filed before the Special Court, PMLA, in these cases.</p>

<p>It was also revealed that under the Foreign Exchange Management Act 1999 (FEMA), assets to the value of $35,046,152 have been seized to date. Chaudhary added that 12 crypto exchanges have been investigated for evading Goods and Services Tax. A further investigation is also ongoing that involves eight cases, and an additional four cases have been closed on payment in which interest and penalties were levied.</p>
India&rsquo;s Stance on Cryptocurrencies
<p>Minister Chaudhary also made it clear:</p>

<p>Currently, crypto assets are unregulated in India. The government does not register crypto exchanges.</p>

<p>Although cryptocurrencies are extremely popular in the country, India&rsquo;s Reserve Bank (RBI) is seeking a total ban on cryptocurrencies. The country has been vocal on its stance regarding crypto assets and maintains that they should be prohibited given their potential to threaten the country&rsquo;s financial stability. The industry has been stifled since a 30% capital gains tax was imposed by union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in March. Under this tax structure, citizens trading in crypto is to pay a capital gains tax of 30% on their cryptocurrencies. Additionally, they will have to pay a 1% tax deducted at source on every transaction. India and its Reserve Bank may be against cryptocurrencies as such but have embraced the blockchain technology that underlies it by launching a digital rupee pilot.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Indian government on Monday provided Parliament with clarity regarding its cryptocurrency bill as well as the status of investigations into crypto exchanges. </p>
<p>The government of India has provided information to various members of Lok Sabha, the lower house of India&rsquo;s parliament, on its plans to regulate cryptocurrencies as well as investigations into crypto exchanges, according to reports by Bitcoin.com.</p>
Government Provides Updates on its Crypto Bill and Regulatory Plans
<p>Parliament member Bhartruhari Mahtab asked the Minister of Finance to indicate &ldquo;the current status of the cryptocurrency bill, which was due for being tabled during the winter session, 2021, of the Parliament&rdquo; and the expected timeframe within which the crypto bill would be tabled and be open to public input.</p>
<p>Without providing a specific timeframe, Pankaj Chaudhary, minister of state in the Ministry of Finance, replied:</p>

<p>Crypto assets are by definition borderless and require international collaboration to prevent regulatory arbitrage. Therefore, any legislation on the subject can be effective only with significant international collaboration on evaluation of the risks and benefits and evolution of common taxonomy and standards.</p>

<p>The Finance Minister was asked to state which ministry and/or department would be responsible for regulating cryptocurrencies and tokens. Chaudhary was also asked which department would regulate other forms of &ldquo;virtual digital assets,&rdquo; including NFTs, decentralised applications (dApps), real estate tokens, and other blockchain-based assets, to which he responded:</p>

<p>Currently, policy related to crypto assets and related ecosystem is with the Ministry of Finance.</p>

Details Regarding Crypto Exchanges Under Investigation Also Sought
<p>Members of parliament also requested &ldquo;the details of crypto exchanges which are under investigation by the government for money laundering and tax evasion cases.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Western sanctions are crippling Russia&rsquo;s efforts to fight a war and to run its economy. The Duma is to consider a bill to allow a domestic cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>In a desperate bid to get around the harsh sanctions imposed by Western nations on Russia, the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, will consider a bill that would legalise a crypto market in the country.</p>
<p>According to a report earlier today in Newsweek, the bill would also look to legalise the mining of cryptocurrencies and their sale. The bill would be approved extremely quickly given that this would be in effect from January 1, 2023.</p>
<p>The bill states:</p>

<p>"Digital currency obtained as a result of mining can be disposed of by the person who carried out the mining of this digital currency on the condition that Russian information infrastructure is not used in conducting transactions with it, with the exception of cases of transactions carried out in accordance with the established experimental legal regime,"</p>

<p>Anatoly Aksakov, one of the authors of the bill, and chairman of the Duma Financial Markets Committee, stated that crypto mining had existed in Russia for a long while, but that it didn&rsquo;t have regulation. He said:</p>

<p>"Large miners who have devoted their lives to this are now turning to us with a request to introduce their activities into the legal space so that they work normally, pay taxes and not feel fear of the structures that check them, including law enforcement agencies. Therefore, it is obvious that the law is very necessary,"</p>

<p>Aksakov is quoted by Reuters as saying that the launch of a cryptocurrency system in Russia would mean that other countries could also use it, and in his words &ldquo;end America&rsquo;s control over the global banking system&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Apart from being kicked out of the SWIFT global banking system, Russia also lacks a diversified economy, and a stable business environment that would help the economy to recover, according to the Wilson Centre, a US-based think tank.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Domain names are undoubtedly hot assets in today&rsquo;s tech-driven world. According to VeriSign&rsquo;s Domain Name Industry Brief, the third quarter of 2022 witnessed over 349 million domain registrations. Additionally, a report published by Godaddy, an internet domain registrar and web hosting company, revealed that the average price of a domain name sold in the secondary market (from someone who already owns it) climbed up to thousands of dollars. In 2019, MicroStrategy bought Voice.com from the owner for a mouth-watering amount of $30 million. This year (2022), Connect.com was sold for a whopping $10 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously Web3 domains are just a big new market at its very early rise. How to benefit from it? The advent of Web3 has also introduced a new twitch to the domain market, with Web3 domains like ENS already selling high in the market. For example, on September 22, 2022, a buyer bought &ldquo;pjfi.eth&rdquo; for 0.12 ETH or $161 and later sold it for 350 ETH or $463 200. Also, 000.eth bought for 2.6 ETH or $638 on June 10, 2020, was sold for 300 ETH or $317,000 on July 3, 2022. Not to mention that this is not a purchase to own. ENS sales domains based on the renting model like Web 2.0 does.</p>
<p>W3DNA is a revolutionary Web3 domain name service that significantly improved on what the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is currently offering. While the ENS is built on only the Ethereum blockchain, W3DNA supports Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Ethereum, and Polygon. You have already seen the profit margins of those that have purchased with the ENS. Now let us imagine what the future holds for an arguably more robust web3 domain registrar like W3DNA. It undoubtedly presents a good investment opportunity for those who understand that the future lies with Web3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More Details about W3DNA Domains</p>
<p>W3DNA is an NFT domain, name, and account deployed on Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and Ethereum blockchain protocols. After your registration with W3DNA, you will be automatically given a username in addition to an account. With such an account, users can receive payment in any cryptocurrency. You can opt to register your W3DNA domain in any language and choose any symbol you want including emoji. The W3DNA domain does not have any extension, and there are also no length limits from just one letter, sign, number, picture to infinity.</p>
<p>How W3DNA Works</p>
<p>The W3DNA offers users an NFT domain, a name, and an account, thus breaking new ground in Web3. The name provided by W3DNA gives users exclusive ownership. It allows name owners to store their avatars and other profile information they can use in W3DNA services, including social networks, decentralized messengers, etc. Additionally, the account will enable users to store all their crypto addresses, ensuring they can accept payment in any cryptocurrency of their choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>W3DNA is designed to free users from an obligatory assignment of any top level domain in the form name.com, .edu, .net, etc.. This approach ensures that two users do not have twin domain names, for example, "sales.com" and "sales.net." The platform does not restrict users to particular symbols or languages. User can choose domain name in the same language that is native to the audience. By allowing users to Synchronized mint on three chains with an unlimited number of EVM chains to be integrated in the nearest future protect users from mistakes when receiving or transferring crypto assets. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Advantages and Disadvantages of W3DNA&nbsp;</p>
<p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>W3DNA does not have extensions (that is .com, .etc, .bsc, .net, .edu, .art), thus granting exclusive ownership until you opt to sell it.</li>
<li>The absence of extensions increases the investment value, blocking any other&nbsp; user from purchasing the same domain with a mix of letters from different alphabets or different extensions. The same goes for punctuation marks.</li>
<li>You can earn huge returns by reselling the domains on marketplaces like OpenSea or Rarible.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Users can mint their NFT domain only once on three different chains (BSC, Polygon, and Ethereum) simultaneously.&nbsp;</li>
<li>You only pay for the domain once and own it forever - there are no renewal fees in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Since W3DNA does not allow extensions, two users cannot share a name. For example, you cannot have names like Chain.com and Chain.io for two different owners. However, being an owner of Chain you can keep different websites of three different chains.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The price of domains increases based on the number sold. Starting at a basic $15 at the launch period the price will increase to a minimum of $30 within less than a year. Therefore, the longer you procrastinate buying a domain, the more likely you are to pay a higher price.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>How You can Buy and Sell Domains</p>
<p>Buying and selling domains is pretty straightforward, provided you have a good understanding of the processes involved. First, you must already know the W3DNA domain name(s) you want to buy or sell. Here is a step-by-step guide on buying and selling your domain on W3DNA.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Log in to the W3DNA site and type in the domain in the language of your choice which you aim to buy and check if it is available.</li>
<li>Once you verify that this&nbsp; domain is available, the price for the domain is displayed.</li>
<li>Finally choose a payment method from crypto, credit card, or payment service to pay for the domain. You can pay with USDT (Bep-20), BTC, ETH, or other accepted cryptocurrencies. You can also pay using your bank card.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Earning Great Returns from W3DNA</p>
<p>As the introduction explains, you can make huge amounts of money buying and selling Web3 domains, just like the ENS where people spend as little as $150 on domains and then resell them for over $300k. Just think of the fact that in the case of ENS people are not reselling the domain per say they are reselling the right to rent it from ENS. From the W3DNA&nbsp; you can purchase unique and sort-after domains for as low as $15 and resell for as high as 10,000X in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine buying a Ronaldo or Messi domain for less than $50 and having to resell it for much higher amounts than the initial price paid. This is the opportunity that W3DNA has presented to you today. See detailed information here to learn how to buy and sell W3DNA domains.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Web3 domains are just beginning to gain popularity. Soon everyone will have their own domain wallet, and now there is a great chance to make money on it. The opportunity to invest and resell your domains in the future is a chance that cannot be missed. For more information and great buying opportunities on W3DNA, click here.&nbsp;</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Domain names are undoubtedly hot assets in today&rsquo;s tech-driven world. According to VeriSign&rsquo;s Domain Name Industry Brief, the third quarter of 2022 witnessed over 349 million domain registrations. Additionally, a report published by Godaddy, an internet domain registrar and web hosting company, revealed that the average price of a domain name sold in the secondary market (from someone who already owns it) climbed up to thousands of dollars. In 2019, MicroStrategy bought Voice.com from the owner for a mouth-watering amount of $30 million. This year (2022), Connect.com was sold for a whopping $10 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously Web3 domains are just a big new market at its very early rise. How to benefit from it? The advent of Web3 has also introduced a new twitch to the domain market, with Web3 domains like ENS already selling high in the market. For example, on September 22, 2022, a buyer bought &ldquo;pjfi.eth&rdquo; for 0.12 ETH or $161 and later sold it for 350 ETH or $463 200. Also, 000.eth bought for 2.6 ETH or $638 on June 10, 2020, was sold for 300 ETH or $317,000 on July 3, 2022. Not to mention that this is not a purchase to own. ENS sales domains based on the renting model like Web 2.0 does.</p>
<p>W3DNA is a revolutionary Web3 domain name service that significantly improved on what the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is currently offering. While the ENS is built on only the Ethereum blockchain, W3DNA supports Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Ethereum, and Polygon. You have already seen the profit margins of those that have purchased with the ENS. Now let us imagine what the future holds for an arguably more robust web3 domain registrar like W3DNA. It undoubtedly presents a good investment opportunity for those who understand that the future lies with Web3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More Details about W3DNA Domains</p>
<p>W3DNA is an NFT domain, name, and account deployed on Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and Ethereum blockchain protocols. After your registration with W3DNA, you will be automatically given a username in addition to an account. With such an account, users can receive payment in any cryptocurrency. You can opt to register your W3DNA domain in any language and choose any symbol you want including emoji. The W3DNA domain does not have any extension, and there are also no length limits from just one letter, sign, number, picture to infinity.</p>
<p>How W3DNA Works</p>
<p>The W3DNA offers users an NFT domain, a name, and an account, thus breaking new ground in Web3. The name provided by W3DNA gives users exclusive ownership. It allows name owners to store their avatars and other profile information they can use in W3DNA services, including social networks, decentralized messengers, etc. Additionally, the account will enable users to store all their crypto addresses, ensuring they can accept payment in any cryptocurrency of their choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>W3DNA is designed to free users from an obligatory assignment of any top level domain in the form name.com, .edu, .net, etc.. This approach ensures that two users do not have twin domain names, for example, "sales.com" and "sales.net." The platform does not restrict users to particular symbols or languages. User can choose domain name in the same language that is native to the audience. By allowing users to Synchronized mint on three chains with an unlimited number of EVM chains to be integrated in the nearest future protect users from mistakes when receiving or transferring crypto assets. &nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Japanese police have started seizing crypto assets over unpaid parking fines.</p>
<p>In a Japanese prefecture north of Tokyo, police have widened the list of assets they would normally seize from citizens who do not pay their parking fines.</p>
<p>Normally the police would seize savings or property, such as a car, of the non-paying individual, but in keeping with changing technological times, the police have begun to seize crypto assets.</p>
<p>An article in The Asahi Shimbun, an English language Japan/Asia news platform, tells how police in the Saitama prefecture north of Tokyo have been successful in seizing assets over unpaid parking tickets.</p>
<p>In the fiscal year 2021, Saitama police seized savings or vehicles in 99% of the 477 cases of unpaid parking tickets. However, by March this year, 925 cases were still outstanding as police were unable to seize assets. This amounted to a value of more than 13 million yen ($95,000).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, in August this year police were able to confiscate crypto worth 113,000 yen from a man who had five fines for illegal parking. According to the article report, this was the third time that crypto had been seized over unpaid parking fines.</p>
<p>A saitama police official commented on how other assets would actively be confiscated over unpaid fines:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Individuals&rsquo; assets are not limited to savings nowadays. It wouldn&rsquo;t be fair if we can&rsquo;t collect fines just because the car owners don&rsquo;t have cash. We will actively seize assets in cryptocurrency or investment funds from now on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The National Police Agency (NPA) does not collect information on which assets were seized over parking fines, but it has acknowledged that the prefectural police of Hyogo, and Gifu, had also seized cryptocurrencies among other assets.</p>
<p>Toki Kawase, a lawyer with knowledge of crypto assets, was quoted as saying that &ldquo;Public authorities are catching up with what&rsquo;s happening in the real world,&rdquo; but he did add however that:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not difficult to evade asset seizures by moving those assets overseas on the internet. Therefore, it&rsquo;s necessary to continue passing legislation that reflects technological advances.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Bankrupt cryptocurrency lender BlockFi has filed a motion to a United States bankruptcy court for permission to return frozen cryptocurrencies held in BlockFi wallets to its users. </p>
<p>Crypto lending platform BlockFi filed a motion on December 19 to a U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the District of New Jersey seeking permission to allow its users to withdraw their cryptocurrencies from frozen BlockFi wallets. In the motion, BlockFi asked the court for authority to honor client withdrawals from wallets that have been frozen since November 10. The news was first reported by Cointelegraph.&nbsp;</p>
How BlockFi and FTX Became Financially Entangled
<p>BlockFi filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US late in November just days after it was forced to suspend withdrawals amid the fallout from the complete collapse of FTX. BlockFi became financially entangled with FTX in June 2022 when the exchange agreed to provide the company with a credit line of $400 million. By extending the credit line, FTX also acquired the option to buy BlockFi.</p>
<p>The agreement between the two companies meant that they became financially involved and the fall of FTX has obviously had serious implications for BlockFi. As previously stated, only a couple of days after FTX&rsquo;s collapse, BlockFi suspended withdrawals saying that it had &ldquo;significant exposure&rdquo; to FTX, including undrawn amounts still existing from the credit line FTX extended to it.</p>
Details of BlockFi&rsquo;s Motion
<p>Included in BlockFi&rsquo;s court documents, the firm requested permission to update its user interface to properly reflect transactions as of the platform&rsquo;s pause. BlockFi also shared an email to affected users calling the motion an &ldquo;important step toward our goal of returning assets to clients through our chapter 11 cases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>BlockFi added:</p>

<p>It is our belief that clients unambiguously own the digital assets in their BlockFi Wallet Accounts.</p>

<p>BlockFi further indicated that their motion will not impact withdrawals or transfers from BlockFi Interest Accounts as they remain paused at the moment. According to the documents filed to the court, a hearing to decide if the motion will be granted is scheduled for January 9, 2023.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Canva.com</p>
<p>Followers of the cryptocurrency space have probably already heard of decentralized autonomous organizations. They&rsquo;re a popular recent trend in which crypto projects are led by their communities, as opposed to some kind of centralized authorities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DAOs, as they&rsquo;re known, are fully autonomous and transparent entities governed by smart contracts that set out their foundational rules, execute any agreed-upon decisions made by the community and more. Within a DAO, voting rights are generally based on how many &ldquo;tokens&rdquo; an individual holds. In most cases, any token holder is able to make a proposal regarding the DAO, its actions, the disbursement of its treasury, investment decisions and more. The rest of the community then gets to vote on those proposals, with the result being enforced by smart contract code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, DAOs are governed entirely by their members, who collectively make all of the most important decisions regarding the future of the project, including technical upgrades. In order for a proposal to be passed, it must achieve a predefined level of consensus to be accepted. In this way, DAOs are considered to be democratic organizations that can serve as an alternative to the familiar hierarchical structure seen within most traditional organizations. DAOs are all about community collaboration, with each individual member participating at some level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the most elegant things about the DAO framework is the way incentives are aligned. By that, we mean it&rsquo;s usually in each member&rsquo;s best interest to be forthright about their voting decisions, approving only those proposals that best serve the interests of the project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assuming that the protocol in question is healthy and robust and working towards something beneficial, it should slowly gather more users and boost the value of its native tokens. In this way, members of the DAO always get to share in its success.&nbsp;</p>
How Do DAOs Work?
<p>With most DAOs, the rules of the protocol are established by its founders, which in most cases is just a core team of community members. They create the smart contracts that lay out the DAOs&rsquo; foundational framework, which establishes the purpose of the DAO, the rules about how it operates, what is necessary for a proposal to achieve consensus, and so on. These smart contracts must be transparent, verifiable and publicly auditable in order to win the trust of new members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the rules of the DAO have been formally written to the blockchain, the next step is to fund the DAO and figure out how to bestow governance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In most cases, initial funding is achieved through token issuance, wherein the protocol sells governance tokens that equate directly to voting power. Those who&rsquo;re interested in participating in the DAO can acquire these tokens, with the funds generated from the sale going to the DAO&rsquo;s treasury.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In return for their investment, members acquire voting rights that are generally proportional to the number of tokens they hold. Once the initial funding stage is complete, the DAO is ready to be deployed and start fulfilling its purpose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most DAOs also share some of the profits they generate with their community members, based on the number of tokens each individual holds. A certain amount of those profits is usually always directed to the DAO&rsquo;s treasury too.</p>
How Can DAO&rsquo;s Generate Profits?
<p>DAOs can make money in multiple ways, through charging for access, services or a commission, or through various kinds of investments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, a DAO can vote to issue additional governance tokens and raise money that way, effectively charging new users for the right to access the DAO. One popular DAO that does this is FriendsWithBenefits, which describes itself as a group of cultural creators, thinkers, and builders who convene digitally and in real life to collaboratively shape the future of Web3. Individuals must own at least one FWB token to be able to access its community. However, it&rsquo;s important to note that there&rsquo;s a disincentive for existing token holders to issue more tokens, as doing so can dilute the value of their own holdings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of this, many DAOs look to make money in other ways, such as by charging users for a service it provides. BanklessDAO, for example, charges customers for the consulting services it renders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the more sophisticated DAOs in the crypto space rely on investments in decentralized finance as a way of making money. On a simple level, this involves investing in various DeFi protocols and &ldquo;staking&rdquo; different kinds of tokens to earn yield, or providing liquidity to decentralized exchange liquidity pools to earn a percentage of trading fees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other DAOs have become so heavily invested in the space that they&rsquo;re now actively accumulating tokens belonging to other DAOs that govern some of the most popular DeFi protocols, so as to accrue greater voting rights and direct additional rewards to themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, the so-called &ldquo;Balancer Wars&rdquo; has seen a number of well-known DAOs, including Olympus, Lido, Gnosis and Badger, work to accumulate veBAL tokens in order to vote on Balancer proposals that benefit themselves. They&rsquo;re increasingly taking advantage of a DeFi protocol known as Aura Finance that maximizes the incentives for veBAL holders by enabling them to earn additional rewards in the form of AURA tokens, which means more profit to accrue even more veBAL in the long run.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aura&rsquo;s auraBAL token acts as a liquid wrapper for veBAL. DAOs can simply swap their veBAL holdings for auraBAL and earn additional rewards through AURA&rsquo;s performance fees, as well as AURA tokens. Further, they can also deposit their auraBAL tokens into the auraBAL/(80/20 BAL/ETH BPT) liquidity pool on Balancer. For this, they can recieve auraBAL/BPT tokens that can then be staked on Aura Finance to earn a separate pool of AURA rewards for providing liquidity to other users.</p>
<p>If this all sounds complex&hellip; That&rsquo;s because it is. The thing to understand though is that these DAOs are all competing for influence within the Balancer DeFi protocol so as to direct more rewards to themselves and increase their bottom lines by filling their treasuries. It&rsquo;s a method that clearly works too, with Aura Finance rising from nowhere to become the 20th biggest DeFi protocol, just months after it launched.&nbsp;</p>
How To Get Involved In A DAO?
<p>The real beauty of DAOs is that anyone can get involved in one, so long as they&rsquo;re willing to invest in it. Users simply have to identify a project of interest and establish that it is working as it should, and ideally generating revenue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing to consider is that not all DAOs operate with the same purpose. Therefore, users should first identify the core function of any DAO they&rsquo;re interested in joining.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For DAOs that are focused on technical governance, it&rsquo;s necessary to understand what voting rights are bestowed on token holders and the kinds of proposals at stake. With Uniswap, for example, token holders are entitled to vote on how the fees collected by its treasury are distributed among themselves. However, with Compound, token holders are only allowed to vote on how the fees it generates are spent on bug fixes and system upgrades - they cannot vote to increase their own rewards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both Uniswap and Compound also use a part of their treasuries to fund other projects through DAO grants. Developers are free to apply for grants and highlight how their own projects may benefit the DAO itself. Then, token holders can vote on whether or not to fund the project, and if so, how much should be allocated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some DAOs are less interested in governance of the technical aspects of the protocol, and instead more focused on treasury pooling and allocation. Take SharkDAO, which is a collective that aims to pool its members&rsquo; funds in order to acquire highly sought after NFTs that are too expensive for most individuals to acquire by themselves.

<p>Followers of the cryptocurrency space have probably already heard of decentralized autonomous organizations. They&rsquo;re a popular recent trend in which crypto projects are led by their communities, as opposed to some kind of centralized authorities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DAOs, as they&rsquo;re known, are fully autonomous and transparent entities governed by smart contracts that set out their foundational rules, execute any agreed-upon decisions made by the community and more. Within a DAO, voting rights are generally based on how many &ldquo;tokens&rdquo; an individual holds. In most cases, any token holder is able to make a proposal regarding the DAO, its actions, the disbursement of its treasury, investment decisions and more. The rest of the community then gets to vote on those proposals, with the result being enforced by smart contract code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, DAOs are governed entirely by their members, who collectively make all of the most important decisions regarding the future of the project, including technical upgrades. In order for a proposal to be passed, it must achieve a predefined level of consensus to be accepted. In this way, DAOs are considered to be democratic organizations that can serve as an alternative to the familiar hierarchical structure seen within most traditional organizations. DAOs are all about community collaboration, with each individual member participating at some level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the most elegant things about the DAO framework is the way incentives are aligned. By that, we mean it&rsquo;s usually in each member&rsquo;s best interest to be forthright about their voting decisions, approving only those proposals that best serve the interests of the project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assuming that the protocol in question is healthy and robust and working towards something beneficial, it should slowly gather more users and boost the value of its native tokens. In this way, members of the DAO always get to share in its success.&nbsp;</p>
How Do DAOs Work?
<p>With most DAOs, the rules of the protocol are established by its founders, which in most cases is just a core team of community members. They create the smart contracts that lay out the DAOs&rsquo; foundational framework, which establishes the purpose of the DAO, the rules about how it operates, what is necessary for a proposal to achieve consensus, and so on. These smart contracts must be transparent, verifiable and publicly auditable in order to win the trust of new members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the rules of the DAO have been formally written to the blockchain, the next step is to fund the DAO and figure out how to bestow governance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In most cases, initial funding is achieved through token issuance, wherein the protocol sells governance tokens that equate directly to voting power. Those who&rsquo;re interested in participating in the DAO can acquire these tokens, with the funds generated from the sale going to the DAO&rsquo;s treasury.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In return for their investment, members acquire voting rights that are generally proportional to the number of tokens they hold. Once the initial funding stage is complete, the DAO is ready to be deployed and start fulfilling its purpose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most DAOs also share some of the profits they generate with their community members, based on the number of tokens each individual holds. A certain amount of those profits is usually always directed to the DAO&rsquo;s treasury too.</p>
How Can DAO&rsquo;s Generate Profits?
<p>DAOs can make money in multiple ways, through charging for access, services or a commission, or through various kinds of investments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, a DAO can vote to issue additional governance tokens and raise money that way, effectively charging new users for the right to access the DAO. One popular DAO that does this is FriendsWithBenefits, which describes itself as a group of cultural creators, thinkers, and builders who convene digitally and in real life to collaboratively shape the future of Web3. Individuals must own at least one FWB token to be able to access its community. However, it&rsquo;s important to note that there&rsquo;s a disincentive for existing token holders to issue more tokens, as doing so can dilute the value of their own holdings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of this, many DAOs look to make money in other ways, such as by charging users for a service it provides. BanklessDAO, for example, charges customers for the consulting services it renders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the more sophisticated DAOs in the crypto space rely on investments in decentralized finance as a way of making money. On a simple level, this involves investing in various DeFi protocols and &ldquo;staking&rdquo; different kinds of tokens to earn yield, or providing liquidity to decentralized exchange liquidity pools to earn a percentage of trading fees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other DAOs have become so heavily invested in the space that they&rsquo;re now actively accumulating tokens belonging to other DAOs that govern some of the most popular DeFi protocols, so as to accrue greater voting rights and direct additional rewards to themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, the so-called &ldquo;Balancer Wars&rdquo; has seen a number of well-known DAOs, including Olympus, Lido, Gnosis and Badger, work to accumulate veBAL tokens in order to vote on Balancer proposals that benefit themselves. They&rsquo;re increasingly taking advantage of a DeFi protocol known as Aura Finance that maximizes the incentives for veBAL holders by enabling them to earn additional rewards in the form of AURA tokens, which means more profit to accrue even more veBAL in the long run.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aura&rsquo;s auraBAL token acts as a liquid wrapper for veBAL. DAOs can simply swap their veBAL holdings for auraBAL and earn additional rewards through AURA&rsquo;s performance fees, as well as AURA tokens. Further, they can also deposit their auraBAL tokens into the auraBAL/(80/20 BAL/ETH BPT) liquidity pool on Balancer. For this, they can recieve auraBAL/BPT tokens that can then be staked on Aura Finance to earn a separate pool of AURA rewards for providing liquidity to other users.</p>
<p>If this all sounds complex&hellip; That&rsquo;s because it is. The thing to understand though is that these DAOs are all competing for influence within the Balancer DeFi protocol so as to direct more rewards to themselves and increase their bottom lines by filling their treasuries. It&rsquo;s a method that clearly works too, with Aura Finance rising from nowhere to become the 20th biggest DeFi protocol, just months after it launched.&nbsp;</p>
How To Get Involved In A DAO?
<p>The real beauty of DAOs is that anyone can get involved in one, so long as they&rsquo;re willing to invest in it. Users simply have to identify a project of interest and establish that it is working as it should, and ideally generating revenue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing to consider is that not all DAOs operate with the same purpose. Therefore, users should first identify the core function of any DAO they&rsquo;re interested in joining.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For DAOs that are focused on technical governance, it&rsquo;s necessary to understand what voting rights are bestowed on token holders and the kinds of proposals at stake. With Uniswap, for example, token holders are entitled to vote on how the fees collected by its treasury are distributed among themselves. However, with Compound, token holders are only allowed to vote on how the fees it generates are spent on bug fixes and system upgrades - they cannot vote to increase their own rewards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both Uniswap and Compound also use a part of their treasuries to fund other projects through DAO grants. Developers are free to apply for grants and highlight how their own projects may benefit the DAO itself. Then, token holders can vote on whether or not to fund the project, and if so, how much should be allocated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some DAOs are less interested in governance of the technical aspects of the protocol, and instead more focused on treasury pooling and allocation. Take SharkDAO, which is a collective that aims to pool its members&rsquo; funds in order to acquire highly sought after NFTs that are too expensive for most individuals to acquire by themselves. SharkDAO has so far raised more than 1,000 ETH to acquire five &ldquo;Nouns&rdquo;, which are NFTs from a novel experiment in generative, code-driven art that typically sell for in excess of $250,000. It&rsquo;s a unique approach that provides interesting opportunities for individuals who&rsquo;re interested in leveraging the power of a collective.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before getting involved in a DAO, it&rsquo;s important to assess its transparency. The details of the DAO should be publicly available for anyone to read, with a continuous record of its voting. To ensure full transparency, the voting records of individual token holders must also be observable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Participation is everything for DAOs, which rely on their communities to come up with interesting ideas that can help them to achieve their overall goals. Individuals with an entrepreneurial mindset should find this especially interesting, as they can freely submit proposals they feel can help take the DAO forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, the level of participation will vary from token holder to token holder. DAO members can take part as much, or as little as they want. They&rsquo;re free to join the DAO&rsquo;s Discord or Telegram chat room, for example, where they can participate in discussions and take part in ongoing projects, earning compensation for their contributions.

DAO members have the freedom to decide for themselves how involved they want to be. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Geneva, Switzerland, 20th December, 2022, Chainwire</p><p>TRON DAO Ventures (TDV) exists to discover elite startups, invest profoundly, optimize strategically, then exit at an empowering moment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The TRON DAO Ecosystem Fund intends to define decentralization, and TRON DAO recently announced the launch of TDV as part of that effort. TRON DAO has been actively seeking new development teams and startups interested in creating decentralized applications on the TRON blockchain. Existing projects built on other Layer 1 blockchains that have thriving communities and established MVPs are also desired. TDV was launched to support the best of both &ndash; the elite teams #BUIDLING in the TRON ecosystem AS WELL AS the proven projects able and willing to bridge synergistically into the TRON ecosystem. TRON DAO leaders believe in a decentralized, multi-chain future with seamless interoperability. For projects built on other Layer 1 blockchains, the chance to coordinate strategically for cross-chain functionality is ideal and will spur industry innovation toward mass adoption and recognition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose of TDV is to invest in promising blockchain-based startups, guide and collaborate with them, optimize their efforts, and then exit when the project team has been empowered for their next stage of growth. TRON demonstrated its commitment to decentralization in December 2021 when it transitioned to become one of the largest community-governed DAOs. Now, they hope to empower entrepreneurial endeavors with like-minded dedication. Their aim is to invest across a wide range of categories, all of which exist to develop blockchain-based utility via DeFi, GameFi, NFT, DAO, and Web3 experiences.</p>
<p>All applicants submitting to TDV will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. While the deployment of funds currently averages between $100K to $250K USD per project, the TDV team is open to negotiating more significant funding deals when it&rsquo;s deemed appropriate. The expectation for applicants is to have a long-term vision for TRON-based development with a strategic outlook toward benefiting other TRON projects as well as TRON users. The incorporation of TRON-based tokens, the inclusion of other TRON ecosystem dApps and tools, the integration of USDD, or the involvement of BitTorrent Chain would be a major plus.</p>
<p>An example of a &ldquo;perfect fit&rdquo; for TDV would be later-stage projects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Built on any Layer 1 (including but not limited to TRON)</li>
  <li>With a MVP, Testnet, or Beta ready&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Past pre-seed funding already with $500K+ raises</li>
  <li>Already with committed investors</li>
  <li>Believing they would have strategic synergy with the TRON ecosystem</li>
</ul>
<p>Already, 45 projects have applied for TDV funding and are under review. If interested, please use this link.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there are projects looking to apply for funds that are at the pre-launch phase or at too early of a stage for larger grants, there are alternative funding opportunities through other programs in the broader Ecosystem Fund.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information and explanation about TDV, listen to the recent episode of the Around The Block Podcast, where TRON DAO leaders examined the purpose of TRON DAO Ventures and further explained the process of application and approval. &nbsp;</p>
<p>About TRON DAO</p>
<p>TRON DAO is a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps.</p>
<p>Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of November 2022, it has over 130 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4.4 billion total transactions, and over $9.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government&rsquo;s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (&ldquo;DMC&rdquo;), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica&rsquo;s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In the aftermath of the FTX collapse, we can't help but wonder why an industry that was created so that you can be your own bank actually ended up trusting single bad actors with tens of billions of their own hard-earned money.</p>
<p>Bitcoin was created as a form of digital money that liberates us from banks, enabling true self-custody, protecting us from financial disasters caused by someone else mishandling your money. However, in reality, the norm right now is to keep your crypto on a centralized exchange, which is significantly less safe than using an actual bank.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a constant cycle in our industry: newcomers place their trust in centralized exchanges, leaving significant amounts of funds, sometimes even their life savings, leaving them vulnerable to hacks, misappropriation, and even regulation-imposed account freezing.</p>
Why do newcomers prefer centralized exchanges to self-custody?
<p>The reality is, self-custody is hard.</p>
<p>In order to set up a self-custody wallet, you usually need to install a browser extension, write down a seed phrase and keep it safe. All of those sound relatively easy, but in a world where we&rsquo;re used to signing up for financial services like Robinhood and neobanks like Revolut in mere seconds, those are a lot of hoops to jump through. It&rsquo;s intimidating.</p>
<p>Anyone who&rsquo;s helped their friends set up a crypto wallet knows how unrealistic it is to expect most people to have the patience for this. The onboarding process of a centralized exchange is unarguably 10x easier.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the seed phrase is still misunderstood by many - even by people with plenty of experience. The seed phrase is essentially one very large number that unlocks your wallet. But it is not only that - IT IS your wallet. If you lose it, there&rsquo;s no recovery. Similarly, if someone else has it, they can spend all your funds.</p>
<p>Many of the crypto "hacks" are actually social engineering exploits (see Bored Ape Yacht Club), where users are tricked into giving away their seed phrases. This works because there are legitimate cases where you need to input your seed phrase, such as restoring your wallet from it when you change your device, or when a software update accidentally wipes it. This is clearly dangerous UX.</p>
<p>In short, self-custody isn't really a solution: in it's current form, it&rsquo;s more difficult, error prone and frankly risky to recommend self-custody to someone who&rsquo;s used to the comfort of a centralized exchange.</p>
How do we make self-custody easy?
<p>Clearly, we need a solution that&rsquo;s as easy as centralized exchanges, but as safe as self-custodial wallets.</p>
<p>The solution has been right in front of us the whole time. Vitalik Buterin has been talking about smart contract wallets since the beginning of Ethereum, most recently at the latest DevCon in Bogota on the account abstractions panel.</p>
<p>To understand why smart contract wallets solve so many issues, we must first understand how normal wallets work. They work through a very large number (private key) that you need to keep secret and to protect. The seed phrase is just a way to write this number down. The problem with this is that this is single factor authentication - if you lose it, your funds are gone, and it&rsquo;s very easy for it to get compromised, either through social engineering or malware.</p>
<p>But what are smart contract wallets? Smart contracts themselves are pieces of code that enforce some sort of business logic on the blockchain itself. When applied to wallets, this means that the wallet itself can contain some sort of logic beyond the simple &ldquo;secret number unlocks it&rdquo; principle of normal wallets, allowing multiple functionalities that we&rsquo;re familiar with from normal apps, such as two-factor authentication (2FA), account recovery, paying transaction fees in any token and many more. With the introduction of account recovery, safeguarding a seed phrase is no longer necessary. As such, onboarding can be optimized to be on par with modern fintech apps like Revolut and Robinhood.</p>
<p>They also pave the way for more advanced security features, such as spending limits and fraud monitoring, ensuring that anyone can keep their wallet safe regardless of their experience level.</p>
<p>Also, thanks to multi-factor authentication, wallets are protected from malware, as compromising just one device isn&rsquo;t enough.</p>
Who is building this?

<p>There are not that many wallets in this space: the technology is still cutting-edge and little understood by developers, but there have been recent big advancements.</p>
<p class="line-space">It all started back in 2018 with the Gnosis Safe multisig wallet (now rebranded to&nbsp;Safe) and&nbsp;Argent, which debuted at DevCon in Prague and presented the first user-friendly mobile wallet based on smart contract wallet technology.</p>
<p class="line-space">As of today, Safe safeguards billions of dollars of value, and has weathered multiple crypto storms without any issues. Safe has seen over $400 million inflows following the collapse of FTX, showcasing its dependability once again.</p>
<p>But something has always lacked when it comes to rivaling the incumbent, MetaMask. All smart wallets were somewhat niche - Argent is mobile only and only supports Ethereum (there&rsquo;s a separate app, Argent X, for StarkNet), Safe is focused specifically on multi-signature use cases, which is a great fit for DAOs and corporations.</p>
<p>But what about regular retail use? Ambire Wallet&nbsp;claims to tackle this - it&rsquo;s web based, cross-chain, and has a unique feature: email/password signup - which essentially allows the best of both worlds: the smooth user experience of a centralized exchange with the self-custody and safety provided by a wallet.</p>
<p>Ambire Wallet looks like a newcomer to the space but it actually spun off AdEx Network, which had a built-in smart contract wallet since 2018. Since its launch in early 2022, Ambire Wallet has grown to over 100,000 signups, and supports multiple blockchain networks and Web3 apps.</p>

Are smart contract wallets the future?
<p>We believe that for crypto to grow, it needs to rid itself of its dangerous and unwelcoming wild west nature. As the past years have shown, your coins are not safe - neither&nbsp;on exchanges, nor&nbsp;on regular wallets.</p>
<p>Clearly, a better solution is needed - and smart contract wallets seem to combine the best characteristics of exchanges and wallets - you are still your own bank, without any compromises to UX or inherent dangers or footguns.</p>
<p>This is why the Ethereum community has been talking about incorporating smart contract wallets for years - you&rsquo;ll often hear &ldquo;account abstractions&rdquo;, which is a way to make smart contract wallets &ldquo;native&rdquo; on Ethereum and other EVM chains. Regardless of account abstraction implementation, smart contract wallets exist today and still offer all the aforementioned benefits.</p>
<p>It appears that the time for SCW adoption has never been better, and it can change the way we self-custody for good.</p>

<p>Anyone who&rsquo;s helped their friends set up a crypto wallet knows how unrealistic it is to expect most people to have the patience for this. The onboarding process of a centralized exchange is unarguably 10x easier.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the seed phrase is still misunderstood by many - even by people with plenty of experience. The seed phrase is essentially one very large number that unlocks your wallet. But it is not only that - IT IS your wallet. If you lose it, there&rsquo;s no recovery. Similarly, if someone else has it, they can spend all your funds.</p>
<p>Many of the crypto "hacks" are actually social engineering exploits (see Bored Ape Yacht Club), where users are tricked into giving away their seed phrases. This works because there are legitimate cases where you need to input your seed phrase, such as restoring your wallet from it when you change your device, or when a software update accidentally wipes it. This is clearly dangerous UX.</p>
<p>In short, self-custody isn't really a solution: in it's current form, it&rsquo;s more difficult, error prone and frankly risky to recommend self-custody to someone who&rsquo;s used to the comfort of a centralized exchange.</p>
How do we make self-custody easy?
<p>Clearly, we need a solution that&rsquo;s as easy as centralized exchanges, but as safe as self-custodial wallets.</p>
<p>The solution has been right in front of us the whole time. Vitalik Buterin has been talking about smart contract wallets since the beginning of Ethereum, most recently at the latest DevCon in Bogota on the account abstractions panel.</p>
<p>To understand why smart contract wallets solve so many issues, we must first understand how normal wallets work. They work through a very large number (private key) that you need to keep secret and to protect. The seed phrase is just a way to write this number down. The problem with this is that this is single factor authentication - if you lose it, your funds are gone, and it&rsquo;s very easy for it to get compromised, either through social engineering or malware.</p>
<p>But what are smart contract wallets? Smart contracts themselves are pieces of code that enforce some sort of business logic on the blockchain itself. When applied to wallets, this means that the wallet itself can contain some sort of logic beyond the simple &ldquo;secret number unlocks it&rdquo; principle of normal wallets, allowing multiple functionalities that we&rsquo;re familiar with from normal apps, such as two-factor authentication (2FA), account recovery, paying transaction fees in any token and many more. With the introduction of account recovery, safeguarding a seed phrase is no longer necessary. As such, onboarding can be optimized to be on par with modern fintech apps like Revolut and Robinhood.</p>
<p>They also pave the way for more advanced security features, such as spending limits and fraud monitoring, ensuring that anyone can keep their wallet safe regardless of their experience level.</p>
<p>Also, thanks to multi-factor authentication, wallets are protected from malware, as compromising just one device isn&rsquo;t enough.</p>
Who is building this?

<p>There are not that many wallets in this space: the technology is still cutting-edge and little understood by developers, but there have been recent big advancements.</p>
<p class="line-space">It all started back in 2018 with the Gnosis Safe multisig wallet (now rebranded to&nbsp;Safe) and&nbsp;Argent, which debuted at DevCon in Prague and presented the first user-friendly mobile wallet based on smart contract wallet technology.</p>
<p class="line-space">As of today, Safe safeguards billions of dollars of value, and has weathered multiple crypto storms without any issues. Safe has seen over $400 million inflows following the collapse of FTX, showcasing its dependability once again.</p>
<p>But something has always lacked when it comes to rivaling the incumbent, MetaMask. All smart wallets were somewhat niche - Argent is mobile only and only supports Ethereum (there&rsquo;s a separate app, Argent X, for StarkNet), Safe is focused specifically on multi-signature use cases, which is a great fit for DAOs and corporations.</p>
<p>But what about regular retail use? Ambire Wallet&nbsp;claims to tackle this - it&rsquo;s web based, cross-chain, and has a unique feature: email/password signup - which essentially allows the best of both worlds: the smooth user experience of a centralized exchange with the self-custody and safety provided by a wallet.</p>
<p>Ambire Wallet looks like a newcomer to the space but it actually spun off AdEx Network, which had a built-in smart contract wallet since 2018. Since its launch in early 2022, Ambire Wallet has grown to over 100,000 signups, and supports multiple blockchain networks and Web3 apps.</p>

Are smart contract wallets the future?
<p>We believe that for crypto to grow, it needs to rid itself of its dangerous and unwelcoming wild west nature. As the past years have shown, your coins are not safe - neither&nbsp;on exchanges, nor&nbsp;on regular wallets.</p>
<p>Clearly, a better solution is needed - and smart contract wallets seem to combine the best characteristics of exchanges and wallets - you are still your own bank, without any compromises to UX or inherent dangers or footguns.</p>
<p>This is why the Ethereum community has been talking about incorporating smart contract wallets for years - you&rsquo;ll often hear &ldquo;account abstractions&rdquo;, which is a way to make smart contract wallets &ldquo;native&rdquo; on Ethereum and other EVM chains. Regardless of account abstraction implementation, smart contract wallets exist today and still offer all the aforementioned benefits.</p>
<p>It appears that the time for SCW adoption has never been better, and it can change the way we self-custody for good.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Central Bank of Kazakhstan announced that it will work on deploying its in-house central bank digital currency (CBDC) available as early as 2023 and will expand on the project until the end of 2025. </p>
<p>The National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) has found it to be feasible to launch its in-house CBDC &ndash; the digital tenge. The NBK revealed its findings after it completed the second phase of testing. The results of the second round of testing of the platform and the need for a digital version of its currency have been presented in a whitepaper published by the regulator. In October, Binance CEO Changpeng &ldquo;CZ&rdquo; Zhao announced that the country&rsquo;s CBDC would be integrated with its BNB Chain &ndash; the blockchain built by Binance.</p>
<p>Kazakhstan has been primarily driven to conduct feasibility studies for a CBDC given its potential to improve financial inclusion, promote competition and innovation in the payment industry and increase the country&rsquo;s global competitiveness according to reports by Cointelegraph. A loose translation of the white paper says:</p>

<p>Taking into account the need for technological improvements, infrastructure preparation, development of an operating model and a regulatory framework, it is recommended to ensure a phased implementation over three years.</p>

<p>The third phase of implementation and testing of the CBDC will commence in January and continue through 2023. During this time, developers plan to introduce a solution for the commercial application of the CBDC. A fourth phase, scheduled to end in December 2025 will see the NBK invite more participants to the platform and will launch additional services.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Voyager Digital today announced that Binance.US won a second bidding process following FTX&rsquo;s bankruptcy filing to buy the bankrupt firm&rsquo;s assets for $1.022 billion. </p>
<p>Bankrupt cryptocurrency lender Voyager Digital today announced in a press release that Binance.US has agreed to acquire its assets for $1.022 billion. Binance&rsquo;s bid is a fair market value of Voyager&rsquo;s portfolio which at a current market value stands at around $1 billion. The newly announced deal comes only weeks after a planned FTX-Voyager acquisition fell through as a result of the implosion of FTX and the arrest of its former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. Voyager said in its statement:</p>

<p>The Binance.US bid aims to return crypto to customers in kind, in accordance with court-approved disbursements and platform capabilities.</p>

<p>Voyager was one of the earlier firms to file for bankruptcy protection in July 2022 after defunct cryptocurrency hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) defaulted on a significant loan extended to Voyager per reports by CNBC. When Voyager filed for bankruptcy protection, it had approximately $1.3 billion in assets but was owed over $650 million by 3AC. This amount is a far cry from the $5.8 billion worth of assets Voyager had at the end of 2021.</p>
<p>Voyager said in its press release that Binance.US&rsquo;s offer represented &ldquo;the highest and best bid for its assets after a review of strategic options with the core objective of maximizing the value returned to customers and other creditors on an expedited timeframe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The collapse of Voyager left more than 1.7 million users in the dark as to what would happen to their cryptocurrencies. The initial deal with FTX meant that users would receive an account credit as well as custody of certain cryptos supported by FTX. However, when the issues with FTX&rsquo;s balance sheet came to light it forced the exchange into bankruptcy have left many who had pending deals with FTX completely in the lurch.</p>
