<p>Blocknative, a real-time Ethereum (ETH) infrastructure platform, has newly introduced features including transaction bundle send, cancellation, and replacement support for the Blocknative Builder. Searchers can now submit MEV bundles privately to the Blocknative Builder to be included on-chain. This market utility builds upon Blocknativeâ€™s reliable, real-time infrastructure that is systematically important to the Ethereum ecosystem. [&#8230;]</p>
