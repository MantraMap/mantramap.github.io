										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican Senator from Texas Ted Cruz says he <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/04/28/crypto-price-warning-china-biden-and-the-fed-could-be-about-to-destroy-all-value-of-bitcoin/?sh=662bc0664631" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">doesn’t want a digital</a> dollar or any central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) entering the fray. He believes they’ll bring about an end to bitcoin, a cryptocurrency he has a lot of respect and admiration for.</p>
<h2>Ted Cruz Is Confident a CBDC Would Hurt BTC</h2>
<p>In a recent statement, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ted-cruz/" data-wpel-link="internal">Cruz</a> said the following about CBDCs:</p>
<blockquote><p>We see China moving forward with the intention of using a CBDC to destroy all value of bitcoin, to destroy anonymity, to destroy decentralization. Joe Biden, early in his presidency, issued an executive order directing the Federal Reserve to study creating a CBDC, and the New York branch of the Fed is working on doing exactly that.</p></blockquote>
<p>One can understand his fear. Central bank digital currencies go against everything bitcoin and its initial altcoin counterparts are going for. Initially, they were all designed to serve as decentralized forms of payment for individuals across the globe. Those who couldn’t gain access to products and services in the traditional financial arena could gain them through bitcoin, which only needs a wallet and an internet connection to function and be transferable.</p>
<p>However, with central banks in the mix, these notions would ultimately become null and void. These banks would be the ones issuing the currencies in question, not miners or developers. They would decide who could use them and who would gain access to them. These currencies would destroy all that the first cryptocurrencies stood for and bring about an end to the crypto industry as we know it.</p>
<p>In addition, CBDCs would likely give rise to a new wave of governmental power. Regulators around the world would be able to spy on us and see what we were using our money for. They could look in on our activities and potentially get in the way anytime they wanted.</p>
<p>Cruz thinks CBDCs are wrong for a modern and free world. When discussing how a CBDC could be used against people through government protocols, he stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think that&#8217;s exceptionally dangerous. I&#8217;m very concerned about the risk of a CBDC.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Trying to Keep the Danger Out</h2>
<p>He is also very confident that a CBDC used nationally by everyone would make bitcoin less unique, and thus cause the father of all crypto to become virtually obsolete. He has no doubt that the issuance of a digital dollar or other CBDC would cause the currency to lose all its value. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The same people that want to see a CBDC, they hate bitcoin, and they hate cash. Let&#8217;s be clear: they don&#8217;t like cash for exactly the reason I like cash because it is not subjected to centralized control that is not subject to constant surveillance.</p></blockquote>
<p>In 2022, Cruz submitted legislation that if passed, would prevent the establishment of a digital dollar in America.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jack Dorsey is creating what he’s calling the “Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund” that will, according to a recent statement, ensure <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/jack-dorseys-bitcoin-legal-defense-161256117.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">the open-source nature</a> of all bitcoin’s code.</p>
<h2>Jack Dorsey to the Rescue!</h2>
<p>The idea behind bitcoin is that it should help those who cannot gain access to standard financial products and services. Bitcoin doesn’t care about your history or your financial credit. All it needs is an internet connection and a wallet, and from there, it will perform its magic and keep you autonomous and independent when it comes to your monetary situation.</p>
<p>However, Jack Dorsey is worried that these days could come to an end thanks to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/craig-wright/" data-wpel-link="internal">Craig Wright</a>, an Australian computer scientist who claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the man behind the world’s number one digital currency by market cap. He is presently suing 11 separate crypto developers. Wright filed the suit against them after he said that it was their job to prevent all hacks and compromises of his personal network.</p>
<p>When his system was indeed overtaken by cyberthieves several years back, he allegedly had his private keys stolen from him, resulting in him being cut off from billions of dollars in BTC he says he owned. Dorsey is using his new bitcoin legal fund to defend those that Wright is going after. The case was initially dismissed, but an appeals court is now allowing the case to move forward in 2024.</p>
<p>Lord Justice Birss – who oversaw the appeals situation – said bitcoin’s academic literature alone is enough to question the fully decentralized nature of blockchain. He commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>If the decentralized governance of bitcoin really is a myth, then in my judgment, there is much to be said for the submission that bitcoin developers, while acting as developers, owe fiduciary duties to the true owners of that property.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dorsey and some of his team have since penned a letter challenging these findings. It reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>Litigation and continued threats are having their intended effect. Individual defendants have chosen to capitulate in the absence of legal support. Open-source developers, who are often independent, are especially susceptible to legal pressure. In response, we propose a coordinated and formalized response to help defend developers.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Bitcoin Is Designed for Open-Source Purposes</h2>
<p>One of the big things that appears to be working in the defendants’ case is that bitcoin was potentially released under an open-source MIT license, which at the time of writing, states:</p>
<blockquote><p>In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dorsey thus argues that a win for Wright would bring about the end of all bitcoin’s initial design factors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to crypto, Congress – especially members of the House of Representatives – appear to be split right down the middle. Some <a href="https://www.pionline.com/cryptocurrency/lawmakers-clash-over-need-new-cryptocurrency-laws" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">want strict laws in place</a>, while others – such as various members of the democrat party – believe there are already sufficient statutes in place designed to keep the space stable and customers protected.</p>
<h2>Whether You&#8217;re a Democrat or Republican, Crypto Regulation is Rough</h2>
<p>One of those people is Stephen F. Lynch, a Massachusetts democrat. In an opening statement before the Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Inclusion Subcommittee, Lynch said:</p>
<blockquote><p>It seems unnecessary to reinvent the rules when we already have a regulatory regime that is, indeed, effective.</p></blockquote>
<p>Agreeing with him is Maxine Waters, a democrat representative from California. She serves as the top democrat on the House Financial Services Committee. She said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite what those across the aisle may say, we do not need to create an entirely new and special framework for crypto. We already have one.</p></blockquote>
<p>Others, however, were quick to say otherwise. French Hill – a republican from Arkansas and the subcommittee chairman – commented that one of the biggest problems the crypto arena is constantly having to contend with is the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) constantly being at war with each other regarding who should “rule” over the industry.</p>
<p>So long as rules are not set in place designating which areas should be controlled or overseen by which federal agencies, things are always going to be hairy. He mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>The SEC and the CFTC have created an impossible situation where the same firms are subject to competing enforcement actions by the two different agencies. Absent legislation, our regulators are only pushing entrepreneurs, developers and job creators offshore out of the U.S. system. We have a responsibility to protect our constituents. There are glaring gaps in consumer and investor protections, and regulation by enforcement does nothing to fill that gap.</p></blockquote>
<p>House Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry – a republican from the state of North Carolina – is concerned that overly strict regulation will push crypto exchanges and similar platforms out of America and cause them to set up shop on international land. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>If Congress doesn&#8217;t act, the rest of the world will.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Losing Companies?</h2>
<p>The U.S. is already at risk of losing its main crypto exchange player Coinbase, which recently took out a business license to operate on <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/04/19/coinbase-gets-bermuda-license-plans-to-launch-offshore-exchange-in-coming-weeks/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">the shores of Bermuda</a>. The company is concerned about the country not getting it together when it comes to clear regulation.</p>
<p>The calls for crypto regulation have increased over the last six or seven months given the dire state of the industry in 2022 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/" data-wpel-link="internal">fateful collapse of FTX</a>, which at one time, was considered one of the largest and most prominent trading platforms around.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Birla Cellulose is a company that’s utilizing blockchain technology to <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/birla-greentrack-powered-blockchain-technology-131120821.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">ensure all customers know</a> where their products are coming from, where everything is sourced, and that everything is sustainable.</p>
<h2>Birla Cellulose Is Using Blockchain for Traceability of Fashion Products</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/blockchain/" data-wpel-link="internal">Blockchain</a> is designed to give everything full transparency. It’s mostly used in crypto transactions to record all the data and give everyone full awareness of who’s involved and where the money is going, but there are many industries in which blockchain is now being applied so that consumers and businesses partners can see where products and services derive from and where they wind up.</p>
<p>Birla Cellulose focuses on sustainably sourced, man-made cellulosic fiber products certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI). The goal is to have proof of record for every product showing that they do, indeed, stem from the manufacturing plants and warehouses of Birla Cellulose.</p>
<p>Vaishali Kamble – assistant general manager of business development at the company – gave the following statement about blockchain use:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sustainability in textiles is a growing trend in the fashion industry as consumers are more conscious and aware of the environmental impact. Consumers are shifting their behavior to buy and use clothing that is sustainable and kind to the environment.</p></blockquote>
<p>The blockchain helping the company in its present endeavors is one produced by Kamble and his fellow executives. Known as Green Track, the network fully captures the traceability of each item, starting with the origin and ending with the final product. All this information is indiscriminately shared with both stakeholders and shareholders alike. Kamble continued with:</p>
<blockquote><p>The textile industry is considered to be self-reliant because products at each stage are used as the raw material for the next stage of production, but the process of tracing each step of the clothes manufacturing process, from sourcing of the raw materials to the factories where those materials are made into garments, was missing.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Keeping Things Clean and Clear</h2>
<p>Tiana Quinny – manager of fiber traceability at Birla Cellulose – commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>Current chain-of-custody processes fall short in physical or material authentications, which may lead to false claims and the sourcing of fibers and materials with unchecked environmental risks. Green Track allows real-time access to the raw material journey at every stage of the production process across the complex textile value chain. The technology was built to have two-fold provenance tracking: value chain traceability and source verification through a molecular tracer. The traceability feature improves accountability for the value chain, thus encouraging the brands to adopt the technology… Green Track provides a platform for traceability and transparency that helps to strengthen the… consumers’ connections. The consumer can scan the code and get the complete visibility from forest to fashion, which helps them choose the proper product and expand adoption of the Aditya Birla Group’s cellulosic fibers.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Aria DiMezzo has been sentenced to 18 months in prison <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/aria-dimezzo-of-crypto-6-sentenced-to-18-months-for-bitcoin-scam/ar-AA1alvM6" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">after she was charged</a> with running an unlicensed crypto exchange. The platform was ultimately used by scammers who defrauded elderly individuals in ongoing <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/romance-scams/" data-wpel-link="internal">romance scams</a>.</p>
<h2>Aria DiMezzo Will Serve Her Time in Prison</h2>
<p>DiMezzo was one of six people charged following the raid of a home by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the town of Keene, New Hampshire. Known as the “Crypto 6,” these individuals have also faced charges of money laundering and tax evasion.</p>
<p>DiMezzo and the rest of her crew would often call the elderly individuals in their area and feign romantic interest. They would then work to develop relationships with their victims online or over the phone and seek to gain their trust. From there, they would tell the people they were defrauding about some kind of financial trouble they were enduring and ask if they could wire crypto to their wallets. From there, the money received would be laundered and converted to other assets to hide the activity.</p>
<p>Seth Aframe – an assistant United States attorney – commented on the case in an interview, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Because it wasn’t a safe business, people were hurt. People gave money to Ms. DiMezzo’s business, and they were defrauded.</p></blockquote>
<p>Initially, DiMezzo was facing a maximum penalty of 37 months or just over three years in prison. She and her lawyer argued that only one year was necessary, and that the sentence should occur via home confinement. The argument was that she had no idea scams were taking place.</p>
<p>The present sentence is a situation in which both sides appear to be meeting on middle ground. While the sentence is not the maximum and only a little longer than the requested period, DiMezzo will be required to serve her time in an eight-by-nine cell.</p>
<p>Richard Guerriero – the defendant’s attorney – explained to the judge:</p>
<blockquote><p>As misguided as she was about the licensing issue, she wasn’t trying to defraud anyone. The only thing she did wrong was not have a license.</p></blockquote>
<p>Prosecutors, however, argued that she was in full control and had full awareness of what she was doing in that she earned more than $3 million engaging in said activity in 2020 alone. In addition, they pointed members of the court towards a video in which she refers to one of the victims as “stupid” and “an idiot.” Aframe said:</p>
<blockquote><p>That’s a recipe for disaster and makes the crime more aggravated than simply not getting a license.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Feelings of Remorse</h2>
<p>In a statement, DiMezzo said she felt bad about her actions, claiming:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have nothing but regret… I thought we were making banks frustrated. My goal was to bring down the banks.</p></blockquote>
<p>She also said she will not appeal the decision and will serve her time in jail.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cell phone and internet provider AT&amp;T says anyone with an AT&amp;T email <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/26/hackers-are-breaking-into-att-email-accounts-to-steal-cryptocurrency/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">address is in danger of being</a> targeted by cyberthieves looking to get their hands on cryptocurrency.</p>
<h2>AT&amp;T Email Addresses Are in Danger</h2>
<p>Executives from the phone company have come out to say that hackers are infiltrating the email addresses of users with AT&amp;T email addresses and using them to steal their digital assets. The addresses include att.net accounts, sbcglobal.net accounts, or bellsouth.net accounts. The hackers have gained access to a part of the provider’s internal network. From there, they can create mail keys for any user they victimize.</p>
<p>With these keys in hand, they can use an email app to log into their accounts and begin resetting passwords for services like crypto exchanges or trading platforms. AT&amp;T spokesperson Jim Kimberly says the problem has been identified and that those in charge are working hard to ensure things don’t get any worse than they already are. Jim said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have updated our security controls to prevent this activity. As a precaution, we also proactively required a password reset on some email accounts.</p></blockquote>
<p>While he is not speculating as to how many people have had their accounts compromised at the time of writing, Jim further stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>This process wiped out any secure mail keys that had been created.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the victims to have had their crypto stolen and their account infiltrated said the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>It has been happening repeatedly since November 2022. Probably ten times at this point. I notice it has been done when my Outlook client fails to ‘connect’ and I quickly login to my [AT&amp;T] site and delete their key and create a new one. Very frustrating because it is obvious that the ‘hackers’ have direct access to the database or files containing these customer Outlook keys, and the hackers don’t need to know the user’s AT&amp;T website login to access and change these outlook login keys.</p></blockquote>
<p>A separate user wrote in an online forum:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hello, my email was compromised back in March of this year, and I have done everything I can to reset password, security questions, etc., but occasionally, I’m still getting emails that a secure mail key has been created on my account without my knowledge. They would even delete the email notification, so I don’t see it, but I recently changed to another email for profile updates, so they don’t have access. This sounds like someone still has access to my account, but how?</p></blockquote>
<h2>So Many People Coming Forward</h2>
<p>A final victim wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ve had the same issue for months and just started again. Password wasn’t changed but account locked out, and a mail key [keeps] being created somehow.</p></blockquote>
<p>Adding insult to injury is the fact that AT&amp;T phones have also often <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/att-sued-over-crypto-losses-due-to-sim-swapping/" data-wpel-link="internal">been used in SIM-swapping</a> cases to attack crypto accounts.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Hello to my fellow option traders! Are you ready to dive into the exciting world of options trading and  uncover a powerful strategy for riding the bullish wave? Look no further because we&#8217;re about to  unleash the bull call spread option strategy. This booklet will walk you through each step of the  process and provide you with the information and resources you need to properly navigate the  market. So let&#8217;s get this party started by swapping!    Understanding the Bull Call Spread Strategy  The bull call spread strategy allows you to profit from bullish market movements while minimizing downside risk. It is a low-risk option strategy. It comprises buying a call option with a lower strike  price and selling a call option with a higher strike price and the same expiration date at the same time. Many traders find this strategy to be appealing because it allows for both profit and risk  management.  Selecting the Underlying Asset  Before jumping into a bull call spread, it&#8217;s essential to select the right underlying asset. Look for  liquid stocks or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with sufficient trading volume and open interest.  Conduct thorough fundamental and technical analysis to assess the asset&#8217;s potential for upward  movement. Consider factors such as earnings reports, market trends, and support/resistance levels  to make an informed decision.  Determining the Strike Prices  The best strike prices must be chosen for a bull call spread to succeed. The lower strike call option should be just slightly in-the-money (ITM) to guarantee a bigger delta and successfully capture the  majority of the underlying asset&#8217;s price movement. The higher strike call option should be out-of-the&#8211; money (OTM) to reduce the cost of the trade. Strike prices must be balanced in order to maximize  profit potential while avoiding risk.  Implementing the Bull Call Spread  After deciding on the underlying asset and strike prices, it&#8217;s time to put the bull call spread into  action. To begin the trade, buy the lower strike call option and simultaneously sell the higher strike  call option. The largest risk you&#8217;ll face is a net debit as a result of this. The difference between the  strike prices minus the net debit, on the other hand, represents the prospect of profit.  Managing the Bull Call Spread  After entering the trade, it&#8217;s important to monitor and manage your bull call spread position. Keep a  close eye on the underlying asset&#8217;s price movement and evaluate whether adjustments are needed.  If the market moves in your favor, you may consider letting the trade play out until expiration.  However, if the underlying asset&#8217;s price moves against you, rolling the position forward or closing the  position before expiration can help mitigate losses.  Risk Management and Position Sizing  Risk management is a crucial aspect of options trading. Determine your risk tolerance and allocate  your trades accordingly. Implement stop loss orders to limit potential losses and have contingency  plans in place. Diversify your options positions and consider the impact on your overall portfolio. By  managing risk effectively, you can navigate the market with confidence.  Advanced Strategies and Techniques  Once you&#8217;ve mastered the basics of the bull call spread strategy, you can explore advanced  strategies and techniques to further enhance your trading game. Customizing the strategy with  additional options, such as adding a protective put, can provide additional downside protection.  Utilizing technical analysis to time your entries and exits can help optimize your trade execution.  Stay adaptable and adjust your strategies based on changing market conditions.     Tips and Best Practices for Bull Call Spread Trading  To excel in bull call spread trading, keep the following tips in mind:  Choose liquid options with sufficient volume and open interest to ensure easy entry and exit.  Trade in<a class="read-more" href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/unleashing-the-bull-call-spread-a-profitable-option-strategy/" data-wpel-link="internal">...</a></p>

<li>Bitcoin cash price started a fresh decline from the $117 zone against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>The price is now trading below the $115 zone and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $112.50 on the 4-hour chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair could continue to move down if it breaks the $110 and $107 support levels.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Bitcoin cash price is declining from the $117 zone against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-could-soon-revisit-28500/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a>. BCH/USD could decline heavily if there is a move below $110.</em></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis</h2>
<p>Bitcoin Cash price was able to gain pace for a move above the $112 and $115 resistance levels. BCH even traded above the $116 level before the bears appeared.</p>
<p>A high was formed near $116.83 before the price started a fresh decline. There was a clear move below the $115 and $114 support levels. The pair traded below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $106.99 swing low to the $116.83 high.</p>
<p>The bears even pushed the price below the $112 support. It is now trading below the $115 zone and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-cash-analysis-key-breakout-resistance-sits-at-118/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>.</p>
<p>Immediate resistance is near the $112.50 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $112.50 on the 4-hour chart of the BCH/USD pair. The main resistance sits near the $115 level. Any more gains above $115 could set the pace for a move toward the $117 level.</p>
<p>If there is a move above the $117 resistance, the price could rise toward the $125 zone. If not, the price might continue lower below $110 and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $106.99 swing low to the $116.83 high.</p>
<p>Immediate support on the downside is near the $108 zone. The next major support is near the $107 level, below which the bears might aim $100. The next target for them may perhaps be near the $92 level.</p>

<p>Per his latest interview, it becomes apparent that this hasn’t changed, as <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/i-don-t-understand-why-people-are-more-inclined-to-go-to-bitcoin-than-gold-says-hedge-fund-billionaire-ray-dalio/ar-AA1anPYt" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">he’s still refusing to see the</a> light on the growing cryptocurrency industry and its commander-in-chief BTC.</p>
<p>In his interview, Dalio specifically touted gold and said that he didn’t understand “why people are more inclined to go to bitcoin than gold.” As a gold fanatic, he’s often touting its stability and history, and while he holds bitcoin at press time, he only has a little to his name.</p>
<p>He fully admits that he doesn’t feel the same passion that so many others feel, and he isn’t willing to bet his life or his portfolio on the asset’s growth factors. Citing the problems of the crypto industry, he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cryptocurrency or bitcoin doesn’t move in a reliable way related to almost anything. It, you know, moves up and down because of this move and that move… and unlike gold, let’s say.</p></blockquote>
<p>He went on to claim that gold cannot be beaten in terms of its strength. He mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>Gold is [a] well established blue-chip alternative to fiat money.</p></blockquote>
<p>He then continued with his anti-bitcoin and crypto rant, commenting:</p>
<blockquote><p>Crypto, it’s very easy to track the owners and transactions. It’s not, like, by the government… It doesn’t move in a way that’s consistent with any environments. It’s a small asset class. We talk a lot more about it, but its size is about, you know, 30 percent of the size of Microsoft, and Microsoft is one stock among many stocks.</p></blockquote>
<p>While he acknowledged that bitcoin has had solid bull runs in the past (and it’s enduring one right now <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/is-last-years-crypto-winter-over-analysts-say-yup/" data-wpel-link="internal">at the time of writing</a>), he feels the currency is too volatile and speculative to be taken seriously. He says the results surrounding bitcoin are very up and down, and thus he hasn’t fully transitioned into a position of trust when it comes to the world’s leading digital asset. Dalio said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ve seen people get very rich, and I’ve seen people [go] very broke with it.</p></blockquote>
<h2>It Can&#8217;t Stay Still</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, it appears he has a point with those last statements given the price of bitcoin has been very north and south over the past 18 months or so. The currency rose to a new all-time high of about $68,000 per unit in November of 2021, and in many ways, it appeared unstoppable.</p>
<p>However, 2022 saw the worst crypto winter in history, with bitcoin losing more than 70 percent of its value and dipping into the mid-$16K range by the time the year was over.</p>
