					<description><![CDATA[Ethereum price recovered losses and traded above $1,860 against the US Dollar. ETH must clear $1,920 to start a strong increase in the near term. Ethereum is showing positive signs above the $1,860 level. The price is trading above $1,850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $1,865 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could still struggle to clear the $1,920 resistance zone. Ethereum Price Trims Losses Ethereum’s price found support near the $1,775 zone after a major decline. ETH formed a base and started a fresh increase above the $1,800 resistance zone, similar to Bitcoin. There was a clear move above the $1,840 and $1,850 resistance levels. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $1,865 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. A high is formed near $1,898 and the price is now consolidating gains. Ether is now trading above $1,850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. It is also above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent increase from the $1,777 swing low to the $1,898 high. Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com Immediate resistance is near the $1,900 zone. The next major resistance is near the $1,920 level (a multi-touch zone). A proper move above the $1,900 and $1,920 resistance levels might send Ether toward $1,950. The next resistance sits near $2,000, above which Ethereum could rise toward $2,040. Any more gains above the $2,040 resistance zone might send the price toward the $2,120 resistance. Fresh Decline in ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,900 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,860 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The next major support is near the $1,840 zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent increase from the $1,777 swing low to the $1,898 high. If there is a break below the $1,840 support, the price could decline toward the $1,800 support. Any more losses may perhaps send the price toward the $1,775 level or even $1,740 in the coming sessions. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI &#8211; The RSI for ETH/USD is above the 50 level.

					<description><![CDATA[In a scathing critique of the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) recent actions against the cryptocurrency industry, Ripple Chair Executive Officer (CEO) Brad Garlinghouse has accused the SEC Chair Gary Gensler of “hypocrisy” and “desperation”. In a statement released on Twitter, Garlinghouse called Gensler&#8217;s claims to be &#8220;pro-innovation&#8221; laughable, arguing that the agency&#8217;s recent lawsuits against Ripple and other companies are simply a distraction from their internal struggles. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) Rollercoaster Ride: Is $23,000 The End Of The Line? Ripple CEO Claps Back At SEC Chair Garlinghouse went on to criticize Gensler as an &#8220;unelected bureaucrat&#8221; who is flailing to mask the fact that he and his agency lack the power they so desperately crave. He suggested that the SEC&#8217;s crackdown on the crypto industry is misguided and ultimately harmful to innovation. Furthermore, Ripple CEO Garlinghouse criticizes Gensler for trying to exert power that he doesn&#8217;t possess and suggests that the agency&#8217;s actions are ultimately futile.  On the same note, according to Yassin Mobarak, founder of venture capital firm Dizer Capital, the SEC&#8217;s aggressive approach may be an attempt to prevent a precedent-setting ruling against them in the Ripple case. Mobarak suggests that the SEC may be expediting their attack plans to isolate any potential losses in the Ripple case and claim that they are specific to the facts and circumstances of that case, rather than applicable to the entire cryptocurrency industry. This would enable the SEC to avoid setting a precedent that could have negative implications for the industry as a whole. These comments reflect the growing tension between the SEC and the cryptocurrency industry, with many companies feeling unfairly targeted by the agency&#8217;s regulatory actions. The recent lawsuits against Ripple, Coinbase, and Binance have raised questions about the legitimacy of the SEC&#8217;s claims and the impact of their actions on the wider industry. XRP Price Shows Resilience Amid Regulatory Uncertainty XRP has had a tumultuous few weeks as increased regulatory scrutiny has put pressure on the entire crypto industry. After reaching a key level of $0.500 on May 30, XRP lost some of its momentum amid uncertainty about the future of the industry. However, the market has shown resilience, and XRP has managed to breach the $0.500 level once again. As of the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.5285, up 3% in the last 24 hours. This suggests that investors remain optimistic about the long-term prospects of the cryptocurrency, despite the challenges posed by regulatory uncertainty. What’s more, according to the crypto analyst Egrag Crypto, XRP is nearing what he calls the &#8220;twilight zone&#8221; with a &#8216;W&#8217; formation, which has several measured targets. The non-logarithmic &#8216;W&#8217; formation measured target is between $0.75-$0.85 cents, while the logarithmic &#8216;W&#8217; formation measured target is between $1.00-$1.20. Additionally, the symmetrical triangle full send break-out target is around $5.5, while the Fib 1.618 target is at $6.4, which would represent an uptrend of over 1000% Related Reading: Cardano Founder Unveils SEC Motivation For Suing Binance However, despite these potential price targets, Egrag Crypto also warns of an ultimate shakeout, which could potentially retest the lows seen in June.  Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Jack Dorsey, the former CEO of Twitter, while replying to a comment on June 6, alleged that Ethereum (ETH), the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange, is a security under United States laws.  This controversially implies that holders of ETH should, as directed by law, comply with rules enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Dorsey Claims Ethereum Is A Security Dorsey, a known Bitcoin supporter and the CEO of Square Inc, a financial service company that owns Cash App, has been vocal about BTC&#8217;s underlying technology.  In his assessment, Dorsey thinks Bitcoin can change how money is exchanged.  Amid this, Bitcoin, as a network and a payment solution, can help create a more equitable financial system.  Square is already invested in Bitcoin. On the other hand, Cash App continues to process billions worth of BTC transactions.  SEC officials and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have been recorded saying BTC, the native currency of the Bitcoin network, is a commodity and not an investment contract.  Related Reading: Cardano Founder Unveils SEC Motivation For Suing Binance The SEC and CFTC are two of the leading regulators in the United States tasked with regulating the securities and derivatives markets.  However, considering their broad scopes, their jurisdictions can overlap. Still, their endorsement of Bitcoin as a commodity can further drive adoption and boost liquidity. Dorsey’s statement comes as a regulatory storm in recent days threatens to draw ETH into the mix for several reasons.  The SEC’s chair, Gary Gensler, during a congressional hearing in early February specified that tokens like Ethereum are sold as investments, subsequently generating profits solely from the efforts of others.  Therefore, in the agency’s perception, it may be an investment contract or security subject to federal securities law.  All the same, the commission, he added, was reviewing the crypto markets, including those of Bitcoin and Ethereum, to ensure they are efficient and fair.  While before the House Financial Services Committee in mid-April, Gensler also failed to clarify whether ETH was a security or a commodity.  ETH Remains Sensitive To Regulatory Developments The SEC has brought enforcement actions against several companies that mint tokens on the Ethereum platform.  Leading influencers have also been accused by the SEC of promoting tokens they claim are registered securities.  Despite this, the SEC is yet to issue an official statement on the classification of this cryptocurrency. At the end, the commission could choose not to regulate ETH as a security after it has reviewed all relevant factors.

					<description><![CDATA[After experiencing a promising start to the year, AAVE faced a setback when it encountered resistance at the $92 level, resulting in a 34% correction over a two-month period. The recent blow to the crypto market caused by the SEC suing Binance has further impacted the altcoin&#8217;s performance. In the past 24 hours, AAVE has lost 3% of its value, and on the weekly chart, the coin has seen a significant plunge of nearly 12%. Technical indicators suggest the presence of considerable bearish pressure, with both demand and accumulation declining. Related Reading: Dogecoin Plunges 7% As Whales Make Large Moves With Bitcoin also experiencing a drop to the $25,000 zone, most altcoins have exhibited similar price actions. AAVE has struggled to maintain its price above a crucial support level, and as selling pressure has intensified, it has dipped below that level. The market capitalization of AAVE has also depreciated, indicating that sellers currently hold control over the price at this time. Aave Price Analysis: One-Day Chart As of the time of writing, Aave is trading at $61. The bulls encountered resistance at the $62 level as the broader market showed signs of weakness in recent days. The altcoin&#8217;s resistance levels are at $61.30 and $62.80. If the price breaks above $62.80, it could potentially reach the $65 price level. However, the bears have exerted influence, which may cause Aave to approach its support line at $59. If unable to stay above this support, the coin could drop to $57 and potentially even $51, serving as short-selling targets for traders. The trading volume for Aave in the last session has remained low, indicating a lack of strong buying pressure. Technical Analysis Aave has been facing challenges in generating demand, as reflected in its chart. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates that sellers have outnumbered buyers in the market, with the RSI remaining below the half-line. In order for buying strength to persist, the price needs to surpass overhead resistance levels. Additionally, Aave has dropped below the 20-Simple Moving Average line, suggesting that sellers have been driving the price momentum in the market. These factors indicate the prevailing bearish sentiment surrounding Aave&#8217;s performance. Confirming the bearish sentiment on the chart, Aave has generated sell signals on the one-day chart, aligning with other indicators. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), which illustrates price momentum and potential reversals, has formed red histograms, indicating sell signals for the altcoin.

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows yesterday&#8217;s Bitcoin crash from $27,300 to $25,800 alone sent 6.5% of the supply into a state of loss. Bitcoin Supply In Profit Shrunk Down To 62.5% Following The Price Plunge According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, a further 1.26 million coins were lost after the latest price plummet. The relevant indicator is the &#8220;percent supply in profit,&#8221; which measures the percentage of the total circulating Bitcoin supply currently being held at a profit. The metric calculates this value by going through the on-chain history of all the coins on the network to see what price they were last moved at. If the previous selling price for any coin was less than the current spot value of the asset, then that specific coin is counted inside the profit supply. The counterpart indicator for the percent supply in profit is the &#8220;percent supply in loss,&#8221; which naturally tracks the loss of supply. This metric&#8217;s value can be found by subtracting the percent supply in profit from 100. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin percent supply in profit over the last couple of days: The value of the metric seems to have observed some decline recently &#124; Source: Glassnode on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin percent supply in profit saw a massive plunge as the crash in the cryptocurrency from the $27,300 mark to the $25,800 level took place. The impetus behind this price plunge was the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) suing the cryptocurrency exchange Binance and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, over alleged fraud. Though even though the price saw a 5.8% plunge during this crash, the percentage of the total circulating Bitcoin supply that was sent into a state of loss measured to around 6.5%. Related Reading: Dogecoin Plunges 7% As Whales Make Large Moves The analytics firm also explained the reason behind this discrepancy; the price range that the asset had previously been trading in was host to many investors&#8217; cost basis (that is, the acquisition/buying price). Looks like the prices that BTC had been trading at before were the center of the largest demand profile &#124; Source: Glassnode on Twitter Since a relatively high percentage of the supply had been bought at those levels, it makes sense that a sharp price move below it would send a significant number of coins into a loss. When Bitcoin had been trading around the $25,800 level, the percent supply in profit had dropped to just 62.5%, while preceding the crash, the indicator had a value of about 69%. This would imply that 37.5% of the supply had been lost after the plunge. Related Reading: Bitcoin Slips Below $26,000, Triggers Over $300 Million In Liquidations Since Glassnode posted the chart, however, the cryptocurrency has recovered, pushing back above the $26,000 level. Naturally, this means that some coins would have returned to a profit state. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $26,100, down 4% in the last week.

The relevant indicator is the &#8220;<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-supply-profit-decline-historical-bottom-zone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">percent supply in profit</a>,&#8221; which measures the percentage of the total circulating Bitcoin supply currently being held at a profit.</p>
<p>The metric calculates this value by going through the on-chain history of all the coins on the network to see what price they were last moved at. If the previous selling price for any coin was less than the current spot value of the asset, then that specific coin is counted inside the profit supply.</p>
<p>The counterpart indicator for the percent supply in profit is the &#8220;<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/all/bitcoin-supply-in-loss-hits-a-9-month-low/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">percent supply in loss</a>,&#8221; which naturally tracks the loss of supply. This metric&#8217;s value can be found by subtracting the percent supply in profit from 100.</p>
<p>Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin percent supply in profit over the last couple of days:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone aligncenter" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fx4hIubWYAEHXI4?format=png&amp;name=4096x4096" alt="Bitcoin Percent Supply In Profit" width="4052" height="2334"/></p>

<p>As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin percent supply in profit saw a massive plunge as the crash in the cryptocurrency from the $27,300 mark to the $25,800 level took place.</p>
<p>The impetus behind this price plunge was the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ripple/us-sec-sues-binance-fails-to-mention-ripple-xrp-as-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">suing the cryptocurrency exchange Binance and its CEO</a>, Changpeng Zhao, over alleged fraud.</p>
<p>Though even though the price saw a 5.8% plunge during this crash, the percentage of the total circulating Bitcoin supply that was sent into a state of loss measured to around 6.5%.</p>

<p>The analytics firm also explained the reason behind this discrepancy; the price range that the asset had previously been trading in was host to many investors&#8217; cost basis (that is, the acquisition/buying price).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone aligncenter" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fx2akTSWAAg2GFa?format=png&amp;name=4096x4096" alt="Bitcoin URPD" width="4052" height="2447"/></p>

<p>Since a relatively high percentage of the supply had been bought at those levels, it makes sense that a sharp price move below it would send a significant number of coins into a loss.</p>
<p>When Bitcoin had been trading around the $25,800 level, the percent supply in profit had dropped to just 62.5%, while preceding the crash, the indicator had a value of about 69%. This would imply that 37.5% of the supply had been lost after the plunge.</p>

<p>Since Glassnode posted the chart, however, the cryptocurrency has recovered, pushing back above the $26,000 level. Naturally, this means that some coins would have returned to a profit state.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $26,100, down 4% in the last week.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced a negative reaction following the SEC&#8217;s continued crackdown on the crypto industry. The regulatory body recently filed a complaint against the largest exchange in the industry, Binance, contributing to Bitcoin&#8217;s decline.  However, there may be a glimmer of hope for the cryptocurrency, as it has managed to recover the $26,000 level. This is an important threshold for Bitcoin, as it must maintain this level if it hopes to continue its uptrend. Despite visiting lower lows of $25,300, Bitcoin has managed to bounce back from the 200-day Moving Average (MA). This is significant because the 200-day MA has historically been a strong support level for Bitcoin. In other words, when BTC&#8217;s price has dropped to this level, it has often bounced back up. This suggests bullish sentiment in the market, as traders continue to see value in buying Bitcoin at this price point. Related Reading: KAVA Holds In Green Despite Bears Taking Control Of Crypto Market Expert Discuss Potential Bottoms At $24,000 And $23,000 However, renowned crypto analyst, Altcoin Sherpa, has weighed in on the current state of the Bitcoin market, sharing insights into where the bottom might be. According to Altcoin Sherpa, Bitcoin has been experiencing a lot of support at the $25,000 level, holding up well despite recent market fluctuations. However, he believes there could be even lower levels of liquidity in the market, which could impact Bitcoin&#8217;s price shortly. Altcoin Sherpa points out interesting support areas at the $23,000 and $24,000 levels, potentially serving as a bottom for Bitcoin. However, he advises investors to be patient and wait for the market to find some consolidation before making any investment decisions. The analyst notes that the &#8216;bottom&#8217; should take time, and investors should look for signs of consolidation before making any moves. He also suggests that it may not be the right time to buy alts or BTC at the current level and that a more cautious approach may be warranted. Bitcoin Faces Critical Test Following the same line, crypto analyst Justin Bennet said the $26,500 level had become resistance after yesterday&#8217;s breakdown. The key support area for the week ahead is $25,200, a level that served as resistance for Bitcoin. Bennet expects this to be a significant test for the market, with the potential for ranging price action between $25,200 and $26,500. Bennet advises traders to wait for a confirmed deviation below the $25,200 support level, with channel support near $24,300 serving as a potential technical catalyst. If Bitcoin reclaims the $25,200 level, traders can consider longing BTC within the range. Alternatively, an immediate retest of $26,500 could offer a favorable short opportunity with targets of $25,200 and $24,000.

					<description><![CDATA[The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued the world’s largest crypto exchange Binance and its founder for allegedly violating securities laws.  In light of this, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has expressed his concerns over the SEC’s complaints against Binance.  Cardano Founder Analyzes SEC’s Complaints Against Binance Charles Hoskinson to Twitter to disclose his belief regarding the recent SEC lawsuit against Binance and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao. The Cardano founder noted that such a situation depicts threats to financial freedom and the continuation of crypto in the United States. Related Reading: No All-Time High For Bitcoin In 2023, Former BitMEX Head Arthur Hayes Predicts In his lengthy post, Hoskinson thinks the SEC wants to implement ‘Chokepoint 2.0’ in the country based on the implications of its complaints.  He also pointed out the extensive nature of the complaint, which amounted to 136 pages stating that it could be an integral part of a plan to maintain strict control over the personal financial lives of people. Hoskinson further observed that the SEC’s lawsuit against Binance is not just centered on compliance issues with the exchange. He is concerned that the regulator may include the creation of a centrally-backed digital currency (CBDC) connected to a group of chosen and powerful banks.  Such a move could provide the government absolute control over every area of financial activities from the customers. And Hoskinson thinks that the SEC&#8217;s action displays a political and philosophical disagreement on the existence of crypto and its core principles. Additionally, he mentioned that a group of unappointed persons had streamlined some operations as inappropriate for the open market. These include wallet ownership, economic agency, and self-sovereign identity. So, the SEC intends to have just a few individuals enjoying these privileges. Hoskinson maintained that historically, the current play-out of events indicated the recurring battle between freedom and authoritarianism. According to him, it is not a completely new situation; rather, the clash is between different players and technology, with a change in wording.

The platform for US customers complies with the SEC&#8217;s regulatory demands.

					<description><![CDATA[Coinbase, the leading cryptocurrency trading platform in the United States, has recently found itself embroiled in a legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC filed a lawsuit on Tuesday, accusing Coinbase of operating without proper registration, thereby violating regulations designed to safeguard investors. This lawsuit has sent shockwaves through the crypto market, impacting not only the global cryptocurrency market but also Coinbase&#8217;s stock value and triggering concerns about the broader implications for the industry. The SEC Lawsuit Against Coinbase In a complaint lodged with the Manhattan federal court, the SEC alleges that Coinbase has been functioning as an unregistered broker since about 2019, breaching disclosure requirements aimed at protecting investors. Related Reading: When Is A Token Coming For Coinbase’s Base L2? Here’s What The Roadmap Says The regulator also claims that Coinbase, through its various services such as Coinbase Prime and Coinbase Wallet, facilitated cryptocurrency transactions without obtaining the necessary authorization. SEC Chair Gary Gensler emphasized the gravity of Coinbase&#8217;s alleged failures, stating that they deprived investors of crucial protections against fraud, manipulation, conflicts of interest, and routine inspections. The SEC chairman noted:  Coinbase&#8217;s alleged failures deprive investors of critical protections, including rulebooks that prevent fraud and manipulation, proper disclosure, safeguards against conflicts of interest, and routine inspection. During an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, Gensler remarks about crypto trading platforms and questioned their operational models. He highlighted the fact that these platforms, often referred to as exchanges, encompasses various functions that go beyond traditional exchange activities. Drawing a comparison, he said that the New York Stock Exchange does not engage in hedge fund operations. Market Impact And COIN Stock Decline News of the SEC lawsuit had an immediate impact on Coinbase&#8217;s stock value, which plunged significantly during premarket trading following the filing. The legal action against Coinbase comes on the heels of the SEC&#8217;s recent lawsuit against Binance, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, and its founder Changpeng Zhao, further intensifying scrutiny on the industry. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) Dominance Trend Shifts Alongside Stablecoin Flows: Glassnode In the wake of the SEC lawsuit, Coinbase&#8217;s stock (COIN) has experienced a significant downturn, recording a 13% loss in just one day.

Already, the fallout from these legal challenges has resulted in a 2.8% decline in the global crypto market, causing its overall value to dip below the $1.2 trillion mark, which had previously served as a plateau. Larger crypto market such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) has also fallen dramatically with both recording 2.7% and 1.3% decline in the past 24 hours, respectively.
