			            <description><![CDATA[North Korean group BlueNoroff has find a new way to hack into your crypto wallets. Now it resembles banks and Japanese VC firms.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This December 27, Kaspersky Lab announced that the North Korean hacking group &#8216;BlueNoroff&#8217; stole millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies after creating more than 70 fake domains and impersonating banks and venture capital firms.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://securelist.com/bluenoroff-methods-bypass-motw/108383/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">investigation</a>, most of the domains mimicked Japanese venture capital firms, denoting a strong interest in user and company data within that country.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;After researching the infrastructure that was used, we discovered more than 70 domains used by this group, meaning they were very active until recently. Also, they created numerous fake domains that look like venture capital and bank domains.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>The Bluenoroff Group Perfected Its Infection Techniques</h2>
<p>Until a few months ago, the BlueNoroff group used Word documents to inject malware. However, they recently improved their techniques, creating a new Windows Batch file that allows them to extend the scope and execution mode of their malware.</p>
<p>These new .bat files circumvent Windows Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) security measures, a hidden mark attached to files downloaded from the Internet to protect users against files from untrusted sources.</p>
<p>After a thorough investigation in late September, Kaspersky confirmed that in addition to using new scripts, the BlueNoroff group began using .iso and .vhd disk image files to distribute viruses.</p>
<p>Kaspersky also found that a user in the United Arab Emirates fell victim to the BlueNoroff group after downloading a Word document called &#8220;Shamjit Client Details Form.doc,&#8221; which allowed the hackers to connect to his computer and extract information as they attempted to execute even more potent malware.</p>
<p>Once the hackers were logged into the computer, &#8220;they attempted to fingerprint the victim and install additional malware with high privileges,&#8221; however, the victim executed several commands to gather basic system information, preventing the malware from spreading out even more.</p>
<h2>Hacking Techniques Become More Dangerous</h2>
<p>Believe or not, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/north-korea-leads-the-world-in-crypto-crime-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">reports say</a> that North Korea leads the world in terms of crypto crime. <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/chainalysis-web3-report-preview-safety-compliance-defi" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Reports</a> say that north Korean hackers have been able to steal over $1 billion worth of crypto until may of 2022. Its largest group, Lazarus, has been pointed as responsible for major phishing attacks and malware-spreading techniques</p>
<p>After the theft of <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/largest-crypto-hack-ever-ronin-bridge-exploited-for-600m-in-eth-and-usdc/" data-wpel-link="internal">more than 620 million dollars</a> from Axie Infinity, the North Korean hacker group Lazarus, one of the largest hacker groups in the world, raised enough money to improve their software to such an extent that they created an advanced cryptocurrency scheme through a domain called bloxholder.com which they used as a front to steal the private keys of many of their &#8220;customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/12/06/dev-0139-launches-targeted-attacks-against-the-cryptocurrency-industry/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">reported </a>by Microsoft, attacks targeting cryptocurrency organizations for higher rewards have increased over the past few years, so attacks have become more complex than before.</p>
<p>One of the newest techniques used by hackers through Telegram groups is sending infected files disguised as Excel tables containing exchange company fee structures as a hook.</p>
<p>Once the victims open the files, they download a series of programs allowing the hacker to remotely access the infected device, whether it is a mobile device or a PC.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Dmitry Medvedev believes that the US dollar and the euro will lose their strength, while crypto will come to prominence. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Dmitry Medvedev &#8211; a Russian politician who served as President of the country between 2008 and 2012 &#8211; thinks 2023 could see the crash of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. He suggested that such an event could reduce the power of the euro and the dollar and boost the usage of cryptocurrencies.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Tron&#8217;s Founder &#8211; Justin Sun &#8211; agreed with Medvedev&#8217;s &#8220;insightful comment.&#8221; He also maintained that crypto adoption is gradually rising in China and that &#8220;the best is yet to come.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Medvedev&#8217;s Crypto Forecast</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Numerous prominent individuals and political figures used the approaching end of 2022 as an opportunity to share their predictions on what to expect in the following year. The latest was Dmitry Medvedev &#8211; former President of Russia and ex-PM of the world&#8217;s largest nation by landmass.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He believes the Bretton Woods system (an international monetary agreement that standardized currency exchange rates) could fall apart and prompt the collapse of leading financial institutions, such as the IMF and the World Bank. As a result, two of the world&#8217;s leading fiat currencies &#8211; the euro and dollar &#8211; could lose their dominance as global reserve currencies, triggering a broad cryptocurrency adoption.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">10. The Bretton Woods system of monetary management will collapse, leading to the IMF and World Bank crash. Euro and Dollar will stop circulating as the global reserve currencies. Digital fiat currencies will be actively used instead</p>

<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The List Goes on</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Medvedev&#8217;s list of predictions consisted of some bizarre possible scenarios like the United Kingdom joining back the European Union (EU), the formation of the &#8220;Fourth Reich,&#8221; and a consecutive war between France and the &#8220;Fourth Reich.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The 57-year-old politician also said all the largest stock markets and main economic activity could shift from the United States of America and Europe to Asia.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In addition, he believes a civil war could break out in the US, following which Texas and Mexico could unite in an allied state. After the end of the military conflict, Elon Musk could win the presidential election in numerous states, he concluded.</span></p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PRESS RELEASE &#8211; Road Town, BVI, 27th December 2022]</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.santabrowser.com/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Santa Browser</a> has announced the Version 1 launch of its web3 browser today. Built for an emerging crypto world, the browser claims to bring in the next generation of web3 users by developing tools that allow anyone to leverage the power of blockchain technologies. Due to the extreme volatility of the market, Santa is dedicated to building a “Trustable Technology Stack” that users can firmly rely upon while browsing the web. With the Christmas release of Santa Browser, users can now earn crypto rewards simply by browsing.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We believe that browsers need to evolve a lot more to keep up with the pace at which the internet is evolving.&#8221; said Alekh B, CEO of Santa Browser. &#8220;Our approach to Santa Browser is deeply influenced by the principles of web3 — Anti Monopoly, Transparency, Democracy, Data Privacy, Security &amp; Fair Distribution Of Wealth.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Why Santa Browser?</h2>
<p><strong>Browse-2-Earn</strong></p>
<p>On a mission to reimagine the web, the browser starts with the relationship between users &amp; advertising. With Santa’s Browse2Earn, users can earn crypto rewards for their regular activities online (rewards include but are not limited to ad monetization, search monetization, discounted shopping, etc.) while maintaining control over their privacy.</p>
<h2>Geared For Privacy</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.santabrowser.com/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Santa Browser</a> hosts many features to protect user privacy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Integrated ad blocker — to stop all invasive ads.</li>
<li>Tracker blocker — to stop all online trackers &amp; browser fingerprinting practices.</li>
<li>Ungoogling — while forked from chromium, the browser has been cleansed of all Google trackers, host detectors (tools that identify your IP address) &amp; other privacy-harming features.</li>
<li>Santa also disables other features inherent in the base Chromium build that inhibit control and transparency, while adding/modifying features that promote them. This is an ongoing process.</li>
<li>Santa’s partnership with Eyeo ensures that only Acceptable Ads that abide by the criteria specially developed for and by ad-filtering users, and are non-intrusive are allowed to interact with you.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Military Grade Security</h2>
<p>Santa Browser&#8217;s code has been reviewed and tested for vulnerabilities by Veracode, a programme that validates a company&#8217;s secure software development processes. Veracode Secure code review certification echoes Santa Browser&#8217;s mature practices for creating secure software.</p>
<h2>Planned Features</h2>
<p>Updates in the next few weeks will see the phased release of interesting features such as free single-tab VPN, an immersive dApp store and the browser’s very own decentralized “Santa Wallet” where users can easily collect their rewards.</p>
<h2>About Santa Browser</h2>
<p>A unique Web3 browser exclusively catering to the emerging crypto world &#8211; Santa will give users everything they need to kickstart their crypto journey with safety, ease &amp; convenience. Santa browser does not just resolutely protect the data &amp; privacy of its users, it also generously rewards them. Through Santa’s Rewarded Browsing, users have the option to earn rewards through Ad Monetization, Search Monetization, Discounted Shopping, etc.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Litecoin has kept a low profile in 2022 but managed to unlock several milestones. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While most crypto-assets struggled to keep their price upwards due to the crypto winter, Litecoin appeared to have been decoupling from its peers, which aided its trajectory.</p>
<p>In fact, it has been posting gains over the past month. Despite a promising attempt at a comeback, the developer activity on the network was lagging.</p>
<ul>
<li>Data from Santiment <a href="https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1607494462174814208" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">shows</a> that the development activity first gained traction in early September before skyrocketing in October.</li>
<li>The figures went downhill shortly thereafter &#8211; from 2.26 to 0.12 in a span of two months.</li>
<li>In contrast, Messari <a href="https://twitter.com/litecoin/status/1607541907550265345" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">ranked</a> Litecoin as the second most active chain in estimated on-chain transaction volume over the past 24 hours.</li>
<li>With $2.88 billion in transaction volume, Litecoin is trailing just behind Bitcoin. The volume for the latter stood at a whopping $3.98 billion.</li>
<li>The two crypto-assets were <a href="https://messari.io/screener/chains-activity-E3EE9AE5" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">followed</a> by other prominent networks, such as Cardano, Ethereum, and XRP, with $1.96 billion, $1.04 billion, and $440 million, respectively.</li>
<li>Another bullish note is the average Litecoin balance currently held on Mimblewimble Extension Blocks (MWEB), which has <a href="https://twitter.com/LTCFoundation/status/1607424318866337792?" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">increased</a> to 58,000 LTC, or the equivalent of over $4 million.</li>
<li>Moreover, Litecoin has <a href="https://coinatmradar.com/charts/cryptocurrency-share/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">captured</a> the second spot on the list of the most supported ATM cryptocurrency leaving behind altcoin leader Ethereum.</li>
<li>BitPay&#8217;s recent report further <a href="https://bitpay.com/blog/litecoin-payments-on-the-rise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">highlighted</a> the emergence of Litecoin as a preferred payment method across the globe. In just one year since the crypto payment provider added support for it, monthly LTC payments increased by 109%.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, Litecoin payments account for roughly 27% of all the payments that are processed by Bitpay, only behind Bitcoin, which grabbed the first spot with more than 40% dominance.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[Argo had "inadvertently published material" that "incorrectly" implied the company was filing for bankruptcy amidst market turmoil.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin mining giant Argo Blockchain has requested trading of its shares and unsecured notes on the NASDAQ stock exchange be suspended until December 28th.</p>
<p>The company, which trades on both the NASDAQ and the London Stock Exchange (LSE), <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221227005129/en/Suspension-of-Trading-on-Nasdaq-for-Argo-Blockchain-plc" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">said</a> that it wants to make an announcement before resuming its trade on Wednesday.</p>
<ul>
<li>The latest development comes just two weeks after Argo <a href="https://news.bloombergtax.com/crypto/argo-blockchain-says-company-at-risk-of-having-insufficient-cash" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">warned</a> that it is at risk of holding &#8220;insufficient cash&#8221; to keep up with its operations in the next month.</li>
<li>Its plan to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/argo-blockchain-facing-negative-cash-flow-stocks-plummet-50/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">secure</a> $27 million in partnership with an investor through a shares subscription also fell through in October.</li>
<li>The Bitcoin miner was then reported to be in advanced <a href="https://www.londonstockexchange.com/news-article/ARB/restoration-of-trading-on-the-lse/15754846" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">negotiations</a> with a third party to sell some of its assets and conduct an equipment financing transaction to boost its balance sheet and enhance liquidity, as per a filing with the London Stock Exchange.</li>
<li>However, Argo had expressed hopes to execute a deal without filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy while adding that &#8220;there is no assurance that the company can avoid such a filing.&#8221;</li>
<li>McDermott Will &amp; Emery LLP are acting as legal advisers, while Berkeley Research Group was appointed as the embattled company&#8217;s financial adviser.</li>
<li>Argo revealed mining 198 bitcoins in November, a drop from 204 in the month prior, due to an increase in the Bitcoin network difficulty.</li>
<li>As a result of the market-wide slump, the London-based crypto miner&#8217;s stock is <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/arbk" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">down</a> more than 95% this year from $12.7 to $0.53 at press time.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[The Octopus Network will trim the size of its team by 40% and reduce the salaries of its remaining employees.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Octopus Network &#8211; a multichain crypto network supporting Web3 applications &#8211; will lay off 40% of its staff members to ensure its survival amidst the ongoing crypto winter.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The adverse macroeconomic factors have taken their toll on numerous other industry leaders who took similar action over the past several months. Some examples are Coinbase, CryptoCom, Huobi, Bybit, BitMEX, and others.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This Winter is Different Than the Others</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In a recent letter, Louis Liu &#8211; Founder of Octopus Network &#8211; </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://medium.com/@louisliubj" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">announced</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that they will refactor the team </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">to cope with the unfavorable market conditions. He also argued that the present bear market is somewhat different than the previous ones:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;The current winter is the third winter I&#8217;ve experienced, the first two being 2014–2015 and 2018–2019 — and I see that this winter is very different from the others.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Liu believes that crypto will be among the most affected industries, where high risks and enhanced volatility will continue to reign. He also thinks that the majority of Web3 startups will not endure the challenging times, predicting the negative trend will last for at least another year.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As such, Octopus Network (which supports the development of Web3 blockchain applications) enforced its &#8220;Voluntary Separation Program&#8221; and will dismiss 40% of its total workforce. In addition, the 18 people left will have to agree on a salary-cut deal:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;So, we&#8217;re moving forward with the Voluntary Separation Program. To date, roughly 40% of the members (12 of 30) will leave the core team through the program. The remaining team members will accept a 20% salary cut, and the team token incentive will be suspended indefinitely.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Near Foundation is the &#8220;exclusive strategic investor&#8221; and &#8220;mother-chain&#8221; of Octopus Network. Liu said the partnership between the two entities remains strong, adding that NEAR and IBC will become the &#8220;two cornerstones&#8221; of Octopus&#8217; new strategy.</p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">2022: a Year of Dismissals and Bankruptcies</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Multiple cryptocurrency companies trimmed the size of their divisions, prompted by the market downturn and the decreased interest in digital assets. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The leading US-based exchange </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-ceo-announces-18-layoff-amid-impending-recession/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Coinbase</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> laid off 18% of its employees in June, BlockchainCom dismissed 25%, while the NFT marketplace </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/opensea-lays-off-20-of-staff-due-to-bear-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">OpenSea</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> parted with 20% of its employees.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Companies, including the Argentinian cryptocurrency platform </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/crypto-exchange-lemon-cash-reduces-its-team-by-38/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Lemon Cash</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> and the Aussie trading venue </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/aussie-crypto-exchange-dismisses-almost-half-of-its-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Swyftx</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, went even further, dismissing respectively 38% and 40% of their staff members.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The past several months also saw many firms unable to cope with the turbulence and eventually halting operations or filing for bankruptcy protection. Such examples are the former giants Celsius Network, </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/3ac-files-for-bankruptcy-as-voyager-digital-suspends-withdrawals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Three Arrows Capital (3AC)</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, Vauld, </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-miner-core-scientific-files-for-bankruptcy-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Core Scientific</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, and others.</span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Ethereum's layer 2 scaling platforms took center stage in the network's 2022 chapter.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New data suggest that the ecosystem is seeing record network activity. In the last two months, both layers &#8211; 1 and 2 &#8211; have collectively processed 152 million transactions. However, it is the layer two solutions such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and others that accounted for 58%.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Ethereum mainnet transactions were <a href="https://twitter.com/Dynamo_Patrick/status/1607409934467207168" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">observed</a> to be hovering at their lowest point in over two years, which isn&#8217;t the case for layer two rollups. The latter is responsible for processing as many transactions as the mainnet.</p>
<h2>Arbitrum: Undisputed Layer 2 Leader</h2>
<p>Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync, and StarkNet are four popular Layer 2s. The increased adoption of the first two rollups, however, can also be attributed to the fact that t has become easier for projects to port over. Even well-known centralized crypto exchanges have integrated these two prominent layer-two solutions.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">As developer tooling has matured, it’s become easier for projects to port over to rollups like <a href="https://twitter.com/arbitrum?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@arbitrum</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/optimismFND?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@optimismFND</a> and for CEXs to integrate as fiat on and off-ramps.</p>
<p>As the hype of alternative L1s wore off, commitment to scaling the Ethereum ecosystem paid dividends. <a href="https://t.co/xMTo0DfaOm" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/xMTo0DfaOm</a></p>
<p>— Messari (@MessariCrypto) <a href="https://twitter.com/MessariCrypto/status/1604144491908038657?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">December 17, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Looking at the total value bridged by these protocols, Arbitrum has established a clear dominance with $1.06 billion. Despite the bear market, its growth has been steady and can be partly credited to the Nitro upgrade, which introduced lower fees, increased capacity, and smoother development.</p>
<p>Furthermore, its developer &#8211; Offchain Labs &#8211; raised around $147 million in funding from the likes of Lightspeed Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, Pantera Capital, as well as billionaire Mark Cuban, among others. According to Pitchbook, the firm&#8217;s post-money <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/266539-15/company/profile#deal-history/205501-33T" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">valuation</a> is over $1.2 billion.</p>
<p>In a bid to expand the footprint of Arbitrum, Offchain Labs <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/arbitrum-developer-acquires-ethereum-consensus-client-prysmatic-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">announced</a> the acquisition of Prysmatic Labs, which happens to be one of the core engineering teams behind Ethereum&#8217;s transition to proof-of-stake.</p>
<h2>Optimism Trailing Closely</h2>
<p>The latest <a href="https://defillama.com/chains" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">stats</a> from DeFiLlama also showed that Optimism has grown significantly in terms of TVL share, which currently stood at $526.15 million. Outside of DeFi, the layer 2 solution has <a href="https://dune.com/quixotic_io/Quixotic-Optimism-NFT-Marketpalce" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">witnessed</a> positive growth in the NFT space. The number of buyers of Optimism NFTs has been on a consistent upward trajectory over the last few months. Several initiatives, such as <a href="https://twitter.com/optimismFND/status/1603437456547790848" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">introducing</a> Optimism quests, among others, have managed to attract more users.</p>
<p>The scaling solution <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ethereum-layer-2-optimism-raises-150-million-in-series-b-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">secured</a> $150 million in Series B funding, co-led by Andreessen Horowitz and Paradigm, in March this year.</p>
<p>Layer 2 solutions&#8217; main appeal is declining transaction fees. In that regard, Arbitrum and Optimism have performed fairly well. Dune Analytics data <a href="https://dune.com/queries/1617367/2689499" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">suggested</a> that the fees on both the layer 2 solutions have plunged substantially.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Decentralized finance protocol Defrost Finance has recovered funds from the hacker involved in the V1 flash loan exploit.</p>
<p>In the latest blog <a href="https://medium.com/@Defrost_Finance/hacked-funds-returned-to-defrost-71b9d2d1b458" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">post</a>, Defrost said that it will soon start scanning the on-chain data to return the funds to their rightful owners. However, the platform said that it could take some time to distribute since different users had variable proportions of assets and debt, but assured that the process would be &#8220;concluded fairly swiftly.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Please be aware that the entire operation will be managed transparently using a new contract and that will allow the addresses of affected users to claim their fair share.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The process involves converting all Ether into stablecoins, like Dai, at the on-chain market rate which will then be transferred from the Ethereum blockchain to Avalanche.</li>
<li>The team will then scan the on-chain data &#8220;to find out who owned what before the hack&#8221; following which details will be released.</li>
<li>Defrost also plans to deploy a smart contract to let users claim their assets back in stablecoins to the same addresses.</li>
<li>The platform said that it <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/defrost-finance-drained-for-12m-flash-loan-attack-or-rug-pull/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">suffered</a> its first attack using a flash loan wherein the perpetrator(s) drained funds out of its V2 product. A second larger attack used the owner key to exploit V1.</li>
<li>Initial loss was estimated to be around $12 million.</li>
<li>Blockchain investigator Peckshield speculated that it could be a potential case of rug pull.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[Investment giant Fidelity is showing little fear of the bears with its latest trademark applications. The firm is keen to tap into the Metaverse and NFTs.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Dec. 27, licensed trademark attorney Mike Kondoudis revealed the latest crypto trademark applications from Fidelity Investments.</p>
<p>There were three applications filed broadly covering Metaverse technologies and services, NFTs and marketplaces, virtual land, and cryptocurrency trading.</p>
<p>The first relates to digital media and NFTs, and the second is the provision for an online marketplace for the sale of NFTs.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fidelity?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">#Fidelity</a> has plans for the metaverse!</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Crypto Trademarks Sought by Fidelity</h2>
<p>It appears that Fidelity wants to offer its services in the Metaverse rather than build its own Metaverse. The third trademark application included mutual fund investment services, retirement fund investment services, investment management, financial planning, and electronic bill payment in the Metaverse and other virtual worlds.</p>
<p>It also mentions digital currency services, crypto trading, wallets, storage, and custody. Pretty much anything related to crypto was mentioned in the application filing.</p>
<p>Fidelity is one of America’s largest pension providers, and it allowed investors to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/fidelity-to-allow-investors-to-add-bitcoin-to-retirement-401k-accounts/" data-wpel-link="internal">include Bitcoin</a> in their pension plans earlier this year. The move <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/us-lawmakers-strongly-urge-fidelity-to-reconsider-its-bitcoin-401k-initiative/" data-wpel-link="internal">riled anti-crypto policymakers</a> such as Elizabeth Warren, who urged the firm to reconsider, citing the same tired warnings over risks and money laundering.</p>
<p>In November, the asset manager’s crypto unit Fidelity Digital Assets, allowed its <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/fidelity-to-offer-bitcoin-and-ethereum-trading-to-retail-investors/" data-wpel-link="internal">retail clients to invest</a> in Bitcoin and Ethereum. The firm is clearly still keen on the asset class and related web3 technologies despite this year’s bear market.</p>
<p>On Dec. 23, international banking giant HSBC filed trademark applications for its name and logo. They include provisions for NFTs, crypto exchange and transfer, and Metaverse credit card processing.</p>
<h2>Metaverse Tokens in Trouble</h2>
<p>The bear market has hit Metaverse-related tokens harder than the dominant assets such as BTC and ETH.</p>
<p>Top Metaverse tokens such as Axie Infinity (AXS), The Sandbox (SAND), and Decentraland (MANA) have all been battered by the bears.</p>
<p>AXS is currently trading at $6.84, having lost 96% from its November 2021 all-time high of $165. Furthermore, SAND is down to $0.442 after getting hit 94.7% from its peak of $8.40 in the same month. Decentraland’s MANA is priced at $0.326, having lost 94.4% over the past year.</p>
<p>Other gaming and Metaverse tokens, such as Enjin Coin (ENJ), Render (RNDR), and Magic (MAGIC), are also down over 90% from their peaks.</p>
